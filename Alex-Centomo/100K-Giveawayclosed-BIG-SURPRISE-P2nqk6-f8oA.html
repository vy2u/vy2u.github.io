Instagram pictures if you have any like
ideas of what I'm going to be giving

gosh she's like so dreamy but yeah so
this is going to be something that's in
the giveaway as well and then the third
thing from brandi is this top you guys
seem to all of this pattern so much on
my Instagram so I decided to include it
in my giveaway and it's just like the
woman in the sky crying tears from like
clouded eyes I don't even know how to
explain this but you guys seem to all
love it a lot so I decide to include it
in my giveaway and then of course you
can't have a brandy melville give away
without giving away a killin it top
because these are so popular oh my gosh
they sell out in the store like this we
get them in there
gone so you will be winning this little
crop killing it t-shirt super soft super
stretchy really comfortable now on to
some random companies that I own
clothing from that I said I would be
giving away and I've shown on Instagram
before i'm sure you guys all know what
job breaking is a lot of like one
Directioners and famous youtubers like
to wear their clothing so I figured why
not give some stuff away from job
breaking first top is this top I hold
this I really like it and it is the lip
forever I'll live forever young tank top
it's super soft super cool so that's one
thing i'll be giving away second thing
is this alien / skull crop top it's so
softest fabric oh my gosh it feels like
air like I kind of feel it right now but
you will be winning this as well now the
next store you guys again guess this on
my Instagram I posted this picture and
you guys were all like that's gonna mean
your giveaway yep it is so this tank top
with a lace trim that you guys all seem
to love so much I will be giving away
this because it's just like such a
beautiful top I love it and you guys all
seem to love it it's from daily look and
I just really like it a lot it's simple
but it's so classic and it's not to crop
and since it's like the lace underneath
it doesn't show too much of the stomach
it's just really really flattering and
really nice so whoever this goes to I
hope you take care of it because I love
it so much the next thing is actually
from a website called steli and I'm I've
talked about this website before I
really like they're stunned I just think
this t-shirt is like so unique and so
cute it's this cropped tee it has a
bunch of flowers and like what looks
like to be I don't even know like a big
rose in the middle um Karina loves this
pattern she has like two different
dresses and tunics with this exact
pattern and I just really like it so I
got another one for you guys because
it's super flattering especially for the
summertime what I like about it is that
no one else has something like it so
every time I wore it out people were
like oh my gosh where is that from it's
so cool so I decide to include another
one for you guys in the giveaway the
next thing is from hunted
dreams you guys know I love hunted
dreams is another Australian website I
just really like their stuff and so I'm
gonna be giving away this romper I don't
know if I could show it it's just like
this crochet detailing and then on the
bottom its crochet and when you're
wearing it actually kind of looks like a
dress because you can't see the shorts
underneath so you could totally pull it
off as wearing it as a dress but it's
short so if it flies up you won't see
any underwear anything like that this
romper is super cute it's really nice I
love wearing it with like chunky black
boots and a hat so the last thing from
the Australian websites are going to be
these shorts which I'm pretty sure I've
shown them before they're from steli as
well and they're just high-waisted
shorts super soft super comfy the ones
that I own like this are like I wear
them all the time to run errands and
stuff they're super comfortable and they
just make the comfy shorts look cute so
it looks like you tried when you got up
in the morning when you actually did it
and they have pockets too which is great
because i hate shorts of no pockets just
my pet peeve now on to look book you
guys know I love lookbook I showed them
a lot of my Instagram let's just start
off with the thing that I'm most
obsessed with this rose top you guys
it's just so cool it's so classic it's
so pretty and um it just it's a little
crop and it's three-quarter length
sleeves and it's just really nice super
flattering on and it perfect for like a
nice like fancy date or something I just
think it's so cute as well as this long
maxi skirt it's just black and plain but
I figured that you know a lot of people
don't have a black plain maxi skirt a
lot of my friends don't have one and i
was just like jeez like I feel like
that's just like a necessity that you
need to have a new wardrobe is just a
black maxi length skirt so this one's
pretty simple it's really flowy which
I'm a huge fan of which got really white
the last thing from lookbook will be
this cardigan and I've shown this
multiple times on Instagram it's just a
simple like beige cardigan it's kind of
chunky it's super cute with a tan it
would be so nice and I would pair this
with like a simple tank top or crop top
underneath with like high-waisted shorts
or high-waisted skirt and this you can
just like throw over if it gets a little
chilly at night or something so
I just really like it a lot I'm the last
thing that you guys will be winning are
from Windsor's so the first thing is
this top it's just very basic very
simple simple great but they have these
leather sleeves and makeup by Matthew 24
here on YouTube has the exact same one
she wears a lot and I figured you guys
would just really like it so I got this
for you guys it's really comfortable
really soft and super basic but I mean
you guys know I love basic stuff the
next thing is this top I don't really
know how to explain this I don't know if
it's like lace or crochet but it's
basically just a tank top that goes more
like this around here and it's kind of
long which is good it's opposite from
like the crops that I normally show and
this crochet is just so pretty in the
front it's really flattering on and I
would wear this with a super cute like
colorful bondo in the summertime just so
nice with like skirt or shorts super
cute wow that was a lot of stuff the
only thing that kind of sucks is like
sizes so I don't really know what sizes
to get so I kind of just got more of
like general like medium and stuff this
giveaway is international for you guys
wondering i forgot to mention that my
last video but it is international oh my
giveaways are going to be international
just because i want a chance for anyone
to be able to win something from my last
giveaway i did a random drawing and i
asked in the comments if you guys had
any other suggestions for how to pick a
winner for next time because i didn't
know if you guys like the run and
picking or if you liked if you wanted
something more personal and majority of
you guys commented and said you wanted
something more personal so for me to
pick somebody that you know did a lot
for me and stuff so this time i decided
to pick someone that has really like
supported me on my Instagram and
supported whoever I promote on my
Instagram like Karina and Kyla and my
cousin Sophia and my friends staff and
everything like that and just shown love
and I was overwhelmed by the amount of
people that do that so it's so hard to
pick someone but I finally did um and
this girl has been following me I think
since I had like 300 followers on
Instagram like from a long time ago i've
known her username for a long time and
she's always supported
everything that I've done she's always
commenting she's always supporting my
friends and my family and stuff like
that and then she even came to me one
day and like direct message and asked me
that she really wanted to model for
brandy but she is not from North America
so she didn't know how to do it and I
told her just you know go into a store
and you know ask them to take pictures
or something and she did and now
sometimes her pictures get posted on
Brandi Europe and Bryony Italy and it's
really cool and I'm just like really
proud of her and I just it's cool i feel
like i have a friend from like far away
because I've known her username for a
long time so I'm sure she knows who she
is by now but it is Lucrezia Kendall
Lori so I'm sorry if it totally
butchered your name I'm pop Italian but
I don't really speak Italian so this is
her so Lucas yeah thank you so much for
the continuous amount of support and
love you give to me but not only to me
to my sister and to my cousin into my
friends you you're so sweet I always
