would fill my 2014 favorites because it
was super requested I didn't do a
December favorites video just because it
was pretty much the same as all my
November favorites and I thought that I
would pick a few fashion beauty like
lifestyle-related favorites of mine from
2014 things that were like maybe not on
trend for everyone but we're definitely
on trend for me and like I wore them all
time and certain things that I like hope
could go into 2015 because I love them
so much so without further ado let's
just get started I'm just wearing this
oversized turtleneck sweater from daily
look it's just very big for sure the
first favorite I have to show is this
cleanser by origins i have been using
this for so long it's the checks and
balances frothy face wash and I kind of
stopped using this for a bit and I went
back to it recently and I forgot why I
stopped because it is amazing it really
helps with redness like evening out your
skin tone and stuff and I just really
like the smell of it it feels great
after you wash it off your face I love
it so the next thing has to be from lush
this is the sea salt ocean salt body
scrub and i actually just bought this
because i ran out of my other one it
looks like this it's just very very oh
my god smells amazing but it's very um
like gentle on your skin it's not too
abrasive I love using this to exfoliate
I use before I self 10 if I'm going to
self tan but I also just use it like
once a week to kind of just get rid of
the dead skin on my body because I don't
especially in the wintertime right now I
get very flaky gross but yeah I love
that and then kind of going on the ocean
theme are two hair products and the
first one is the bumble and bumble
texture spray and the lush sea salt
spray I'm sure you guys already knew
that I was going to show these but these
two combined are my absolute favorite I
don't use them as much in the winter
time but definitely spring summer and
fall I used it like all the time like
every single day i would get out a
shower after my hair was wet and I would
just braid it wait for it to be like
seventy percent dry and then I would
spray this all through it put a bit of
this when it was dry and my hair was
like beautiful
she natural waves and I loved it Plus
these smell amazing together yeah I
guess I can show up one makeup favorite
because this is this has been I've used
it every single day when I use bronzer
for a full year it's the hoola bronzer
by benefit I use this literally every
single day before when i am using
bronzer obviously i don't wear makeup or
bronzer every single day but when i do
look like i've had this all year and
it's hit pan now but it's lasted me like
i think i bought this january of 2014
and it's January 2015 now if you didn't
know which I'm sure you do because where
else would you be living if it wasn't
what now onto fashion items so the first
thing I have to show you our chokers
because chokers were huge for me in 2014
I stumbled upon the website nomadic
store and I think it was because someone
on youtube like showed the store I don't
really remember but basically they have
these like simple chokers like this this
one has just like a pink pendant on it
this one has a good moon in a star but
they also have like little chain Joker's
like this and every time you see me
wearing a choker on Instagram or in any
videos it's probably nomadic store
because they're awesome i have a bunch
of them but these are just like a few of
my favorites i just really like them and
then i also have one from vanessa mooney
and this one is more of like a stretchy
thicker band thats it's more like this i
really like it i loved wearing this in
the full time I thought it was super
cool and have a few others from
different places but basically chokers
were huge from e 2014 I would wear them
like all the time then next would have
to be a different style jeans so i'm
going to show you the first pair
basically okay my huge thing this 2014
was boyfriend jeans boyfriend jean pants
or boyfriend jean shorts i was all about
that i loved it so the first pair both
pairs are from one teaspoon but the
first pair i'm going to show you are
these just these are like the classic
boyfriend pair it's like the acid wash
kind of style very distressed and then
they are just rolled up on the bottoms
i've shown this in multiple videos
before and on instagram
and I've shown them in so many different
videos so I will link that down below if
you want to see what these look like on
because i'm sure you guys all know what
they look like because I've shown them
so many times and then on to my next
favorite which you guys all know because
it was literally in every single video
and picture in the summer all the time
but these shorts by one teaspoon there
are the classic bandit shorts like the
super distressed super baggy boyfriend
jean shorts make your legs look super
nice I love them I wear them low with
like a really nice baggy sure I think
it's super cute love that color actually
purchase it in a black as well because i
obviously black is like my thing i love
the hook I want them to carry into 20
2015 because I'm a huge fan and not
everyone is a fan of them but I
definitely am and I don't care what
people think I kind of dress the way I
like to dress and for some reason you
guys really like that but I do know
there are people out here I can't my
sister that do not like it but I don't
care I love it so the next thing in 2014
for me would have to be hats and you
kind of floppy hat or anything I was
wearing them all the time I have them in
all different colors but I think my
favorite has to be this one from free
people it's just a simple floppy hat I
love the taupe color of it I love that
you can like make it appropriate for any
season because of the taupe color black
as well but I just I know I love like a
detail of this hat with this on the side
i will bring this in the summer with
like you can make it more bohemian make
it more dressy you can kind of do what
you like with it I love it just floppy
super nice and yeah the next um favorite
of mine for 2014 has to be Birkenstocks
because oh my gosh comfort for me is
like the number one thing and
birkenstocks you can't get comfier they
literally form to your foot shape so at
first when you first put them on you
like oh these are kind of weird but then
once they form and you could see like my
foot imprint in them it's kind of gross
but basically
whoo some barking dogs so these
Birkenstocks I got off the free people
website I love the topi color of them
but they go with literally everything I
know people like the black and the white
but for me the taupe goes hand in hand
with the hat it's just simple goes with
everything I love wearing these I wore
them like every single day like they're
amazing for traveling as well the only
thing is they're not waterproof because
they're suede material but I mean it's
not the end of the world like every day
it would be raining I've still wear them
and they didn't get ruined so whatever
and then the last favorite for me for
2014 has to be flannels like I own so
many flannels now I think I own ten
flannels which is ridiculous because I
needs ten flannels like nobody but I
have one in like every different color
and different style different feel and I
think this one has to be my favorite is
just a classic simple blue flannel this
one's from nasty gal it's just oversized
and it's super soft I don't know how to
explain this material it's just like it
honestly feels like my grandfather's old
flannel which I actually have one of his
old flannels and I love this one even
more because of the color and stuff and
it just goes with so much and i know i
really like the feel of it the length of
it and i just love wearing flannels
because you can tie them around your
waist you could throw them on if you're
cold you can literally do so much with
flannels it's so amazing because it kind
of just like ties and out put together
