hair today whoa love it I try putting
dry shampoo in but I don't think I mix
it in properly so if you see any white
anywhere apologies 2016 is here crazy I
know everyone's freaking out oh my god
but seriously it's crazy that 2016 is
here 2015 was a great year I put up a
video yesterday explaining all my goals
for 2016 and what I'm proud of 4 2015 so
if you want to check that out I'll have
it linked down below for you guys but I
wanted to talk about my favorites for
all of 2015 because i have a few like
statement things that I think have been
very Alex for the course of this past
year and i kinda wanna talk about the
move it so first being this necklace
that was recently gifted to me from
Windsor it's my Tiffany and I love it so
much but this is just like Alex and a
necklace so I love chokers you guys know
about him all about chokers but dainty
jewelry especially it's just so me I
look very white right now I need a 10
holy crap yeah let's let's let's get
into it so I guess we'll talk about
beauty first because I don't have much
to talk about for beauty first thing has
to be this Born This Way Foundation I
have this in like so many different
shades and I use it all the time for a
more high-end foundation this is
something i recommend i have normal to
dry skin so just to give you an example
and this makes my skin look dewy and
fresh and nice it doesn't it has kind of
a matte finish but doesn't leave your
skin look flaky or drying or cakey so
it's really really good i've been using
it for a long time I always switch up my
foundations quite often but this is
something I always reach for when I
really want to do a nice look so I think
this is by far my favorite foundation of
2015 that's it for beauty now onto I
guess random but skincare um I recently
discovered not recently probably a few
months ago discovered keels I never
purchased anything from kills before but
I got a bunch of stuff from them I went
and purchased like basically the whole
store this is just one of the products
it's the moisturizer I'm going to go by
the big model after this because this is
the travel size one
and I'm obsessed with it like makes my
skin feel amazing so this is something
that I'm going to be continuing
continuing to use in 2016 then I
recently rediscovered my love of jo
malone's I have so many different things
from them candles perfume / clone
whatever I got this in like 2012 or
something like 2013 out a long time ago
but this is the year that I've worn it
the most this is the wild fig and cassis
sent that is now being discontinued and
I'm so sad about but I actually have
this huge bottle plus another small
bottle because I stocked up and then I
also have their candle their candles
like their best seller for this scent so
I'm really sad that the cologne is being
discontinued but I've been wearing this
so much so um yeah I love this like this
is my 2015 scent and then this is just
one of their candles I have the same
scent of the Cologne in a candle but
this is the one I've been loving right
now it's um grapefruit smells really
fresh really good jo Malone candles are
just amazing so I definitely recommend
if you have a jo Malone in your area to
go check it out it's definitely worth it
every time I have a candle burning from
jo Malone people freak out over it they
come to my house were like holy crap not
even my house my room it just it's so
good I can't wait to like have my own
place and be able to burn all my junk
and off oh my god this is like not
working out ok the next thing I loved up
2015 I'm sure you guys know but why asal
is my new found love definitely made
some crazy investments but also got some
as a gift so I'm very thankful for that
these were a gift but these are probably
my all-time favorite booties ever so
these are private why sell like I said
they're just simple long booties they're
so classic and so nice I've worn them so
much like literally in every city I've
been in for this past year from the fall
till now because i only got them in the
fall Oh obsessed look how nice these are
like what the heck so not saying you
need these there's so many like shoes
that are similar look wise but I have to
say that these shoes do not hurt my feet
I could wear them all day I can walk so
far them and they do not put my feet so
I guess that just comes along with like
why there
civ because well first of all the brand
name but also because they're frickin
comfortable so yeah obsessive these
although look at the bottom oh got to
fix that so these are definitely going
to be worn throughout 2016 in love with
them another trend I guess of mine that
I have been obsessed with if you follow
me on snapchat you already know what I'm
going to talk about but these are deep V
like dress shirts / any kind of shirt
that's a deep V so this one right here
is a long sleeve blouse that tucks into
your pants and it goes down low all the
way you can also clip it there's a clip
here somewhere so if you don't have to
be deep V but I like to have it like
super open I don't wear a bra what I do
is I wear sticky those like sticky
nipple covers and then I also have
double sided sticky tape on like the
edge here and I stick it to my body so
that when I moving stuff like my boobs
will fall out and I can't even bend over
and they don't show or anything so it's
really really really flattering I wear
this all the time seriously this is
something that is a huge trend i have so
many different helps like this but i
figured I'd show this one because it's
one of my favorites it's by the brand
designers remix charlotte as skilled sin
is that how you pronounce it I don't
know but I got this because Gigi Hadid
has it and she award a bunch so I was
like obsessed and I'm obsessed with her
so I got this cuz it's beautiful why not
another trend of mine um is flannel
shirts so I I mean flannels are been
huge for a long time but especially
flannel shirts not like this super
oversized grandpa ones these are by
rails the company rails I own like four
of these now it's just there the softest
things you'll ever feel in your entire
life I don't even know what material
this is but it's amazing and I get them
in a size large because I do want them
to be big yeah this is a size large so
they're not as oversized as like let's
say brandy melville brandy melville
flannels other different material but
they're so flattering and I have so many
different colors and I just get so many
compliments when I wear them I'll either
wear them over a tank top unbuttoned or
I'll just wear it on its own buttoned up
a little bit and kind of like low be
like I just showed you I'm not so nice
where it was shorts in the summer
you can tie it around your waist you can
wear it in the fall time Laird it's just
so versatile and I love the colors of
rails and slick the feeling of them so
another new brand I've tried out in 2015
that I'm now obsessed with is um Paige
Denim so I have two pairs of paige denim
jeans but I'm actually going to be
buying more because they're so friggin
comfortable so these are the I forgot
they're called yeah there's no say it is
it Oh Margo ultra skinny so these are
high waisted black jeans that have rips
in the knees but paige denim jeans are
by far by 4 by far the comfiest denim
I've ever owned in my entire life like
it feels like leggings but they're
actually denim and they're so nice i
pair them with this and these boots and
like the open V top or flannel like it
just looks so amazing and I just love it
so much and yes this is a huge thing for
me in 2015 and it's definitely going to
be going into 2016 love it so freaking
much if I could say by anything that I'm
showing you is trial paige denim like
before anything else try out paige denim
because so you're gonna like be obsessed
and yeah they're kind of expensive but
they're worth it like if you buy j brand
it's kind of like the same price range
but j brand is like nothing like this is
okay just just try it okay trust me make
that investment if you do want a good
pair of jeans when you can afford them I
would save up I would do it you're gonna
be so happy or just go into the store
and try them on because you're gonna be
like wow never gonna go back to another
pair of jeans literally I can't even
wear out their jeans now unless they're
like baggy boyfriend jeans but um yeah
love it another trend has been a huge
I'm sure you're going to notice this
from Instagram but oversized denim
jackets this is by far my favorite one
though it's from nasty gal and I got it
in the spring has a huge rip in the back
there's slight small studs on it and
like literally every single guy that
I've met is obsessed with this jacket
like they're always like whoa where's
that from like it's almost like they
want it but I love it so much it goes
with everything and anything oversized
it's just so me like I obviously you
guys know I just like a boil all the
times but I love the feeling of this
jacket so
yeah but something that has been a huge
trend of mine this past year last but
not least a gray sweaters here's another
one oh my goodness it's cropped it's
thick it's long it's my free people gray
sweaters have been a trend of mine for
years but it's okay i love them so much
so last favorite of mine of 2016 2015
