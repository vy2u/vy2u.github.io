my channel I am sitting in a different
location today because I decided why not
it's taking forever to organize my room
and decorate it so I'm just sitting in
my living room whatever I hope you guys
like it anyways from the beautiful
window so I figured it would be nice
I've been getting a lot of quests to do
back-to-school hairstyles and in all
honesty like I used to do my hair for
when I was younger but then as I got
older and went into university I really
stopped caring and just like would throw
my hair up in a bun all the time
literally wore pajamas to school so I
feel like these types of hairstyles
could definitely apply to school but you
can also wear them in everyday life like
it's not particular dose for school and
if this is like too time-consuming for
school then like don't use this for
school cuz don't worry girl or guy I
totally feel you when it comes to doing
your hair before class when you're like
snoozing your alarm a million times I
feel you I first want to start off by
saying yes I am wearing extensions cuz a
lot of you guys get very confused and my
hair is all of a sudden super long I'm
wearing my favorite luxy hair extensions
from the seamless collection so they're
like the natural balayage ombre one so
you guys know my hair is balayage and
their custom length
good tip for extensions is if ever you
curl them because if you let go out or
something and they're curled the curls
last so long that if you actually didn't
want to like have your hair curled and
pretty for school you can kind of just
like wake up in the morning just curl
like the first few pieces of your hair
put the extensions in and it looks like
you did your whole head like literally
that's what I did today I just curled
the front pieces and everything else is
just like old hair and this is not old
but like these curls have lasted so long
good tip if you don't want to put too
much heat in your hair I personally like
doing it hairstyles with extensions
because it just adds a lot more length a
lot more volume to your like braids or
hairstyles it looks a lot more bohemian
and that's totally my vibe
totally my style and yeah that's what
I'm really into I just love long hair
and I love how it feels and I love how
the seamless collection just you
literally feel like it's flat against
your head there's nothing there like
it's crazy you definitely don't need to
use heat in your hair for these
hairstyles like you can completely have
natural hair and do them if you want it
to curl your hair before head you could
do that too all you'll need for this
hairstyle or these hairstyles are clear
elastics this I got at the dollar store
this is lasted me like five years I'm
not even kidding
like this little baggie I'm almost at
the end and it's very sad but I brought
this a whole over the world with me
because I use it all the time
and this is all you're really gonna need
so what I've been seeing a lot like
trendy wise lately are very not bohemian
but like messy messy braids and just
kind of a lot of braids going on very
loose undone natural but still kind of
done up if that makes any sense and I'm
totally loving that vibe lately so I'm
gonna show you some of my favorite
yourselves to wear that are very easy to
do very simple take like no time at all
and I do think by having extensions in
your hair it just makes all that much
difference so in the end it's up to you
but if you all listen to me I say
definitely wear some extensions I mean
you don't meet with my extensions it's
been like a must of mine for her since
I've been on YouTube basically so I wore
this hairstyle in my back-to-school
lookbook and I got so many questions on
it and it's literally in my head so easy
to do but I think it's so cute and it's
your double braids just in a different
kind of way so what I like to do is keep
two strands in front of my face and I
like to do this to frame my face oh and
if you guys are curious about extensions
I'll have a link cuz I have a promo code
for Lexi hair that you can get money off
so if you guys want to check that out
I'll have all information listed down
below because Lexi is honestly awesome
their company is the best you guys know
love me mean Alex so much but their
whole company is amazing everyone that
works there is so nice and so sweet
and makes me feel like amazing I don't
know they're just the sweetest people
ever oh by the way they're not even
explaining what I'm doing I section my
hair off into two sections just on
people side of my head and I'm grabbing
this side and three sections if you're
gonna do a normal braid and see how the
extensions just adds so much more
thickness to a braid like there's just
so much more going on that's why I like
it so I'm gonna be crossing underneath
the middle sections so regular braid
crossing underneath and I'm only gonna
do this a few times but yeah back to
what I was saying
Lexie they're just the sweetest people
and I'm so part I'm so happy to be a
part of the luxy hair fam so yeah
definitely give them a try check them
out I promise you will not be
disappointed so with my super long
length I tend to braid like halfway down
so I'd say just like above my boob if
you guys have shorter hair like let's
say to your boob just braid halfway then
I'm going to grab a clear hair elastic
and just secure that in place as you can
see it what I'm doing
and then this would just be like a
regular braid right but you're gonna
really pull this out like really go
crazy make it loose and very undone that
is the vibe we are going for almost as
if there's like no braid it just kind of
looks like this weaved basket thing
oh yeah that's kind of the vibe we're
going for right now just very big a lot
of you guys asked me when I started
using extensions and I started using
extensions probably around prom time
because I wanted a lot of hair and I
would buy them from like God I want to
like say anything bad but like they're
dingy they're not good and they're just
from like a local place that I had no
idea that things work these were sold
online and then when I discovered hair
extensions specifically Luxio I was like
okay I've been doing this wrong and I
have never looked back
Plus these don't feel bad on your head
they feel amazing if they don't weigh it
down they're not itchy they just feel
like your own hair just like a lot more
hair
Oh see how this kind of looks like
almost like baskets I don't that makes
any sense or if you guys know what I
mean by that but they're just like
massive braids and then you have the
curls at the bottom which I think add a
perfect touch and that's why curling
your extensions like on another day and
how they just last for so long is so key
and anytime I wear my hair like this I
seriously get so many compliments and
I'm like guys literally took five
seconds like it's a simple braid you
don't even braid the whole way down you
just pull it out like crazy and it looks
amazing and of course I do want to say a
big thank you to Luksa hair because they
are collaborating with me on this video
to bring it for you guys but you guys
know I'm always honest with you and I'm
very transparent and I've been working
with Lexie now for like literally ever
because I'm obsessed and all my friends
on them now too because they just love
the way it looks so yeah this next one
again so simple so easy you're going to
take the front strands instead of having
strands in front of your face now you're
going to take them I would say just like
this section right here that frames your
face that's like an inch thick and what
you're gonna do is you're gonna begin to
twist it you're essentially gonna want
to twist it behind your head but as
you're twisting it you're gonna
incorporate a few other strands that are
by your face like that and then I always
like to keep some hair covering my ear
but that's up to you I'm twisting it all
the way back I'm gonna do this to the
side twisting
so it looks like that and then when I
put them behind my head when I twist it
behind my head I actually secure it with
the elastic and then twist it around
itself and pull it out so that it gives
a look of a really bohemian vibe
and this looks so nice with all your
hair behind but if you want you can grab
a few strands and bring them in the
front as well but something really cute
for picture day honestly for the last
hairstyle you want to bring all of your
hair onto one side doesn't matter which
side you want to do it on and keeping
your middle part I mean it's up to you
you can totally do a side part if you
like that better but I prefer this with
a middle part and making sure I have
some pieces pulled out to frame my face
give it a bit of a more relaxed look and
on this side as well just something like
that and then we're gonna be working
with all of this beautiful long flowy
hair oh my gosh so much hair just flew
everywhere so I don't know what this is
called but I've done it a few times and
I've seen a bunch of people do it so I'm
just gonna do it and call it the fun
twisted braid so we're gonna take two
sections from each side of the pony like
that we're gonna pull them together and
we're going to and once from one side
one's from the back side if that makes
any sense like back here and from the
front I'm gonna put them together and
we're gonna tie them with an elastic
we're gonna pull it to tighten it then
we're gonna like the same thing we did
before twist it around itself like that
so you'll kind of understand as you see
me do this then I'm gonna take you see
how this has like the end piece to it
I'm going to take that and split it and
then include two other pieces from the
side of the ponytail again and secure
those together with another elastic then
I'm gonna find this split and I'm going
to twist it around itself again so you
see how it's starting to kind of look
like a fishtail but it's not a fishtail
it's like a very easy different way of
doing it then again you're gonna split
just this bottom part into grabbing
sections underneath from the outsides
collecting it together and then
attaching it in another
honi then twisting it around itself
again and there you go and then we're
gonna do it all the way down until you
have nothing left
then you're gonna just pull out pieces
get this awesome intricate braid this is
awesome and literally takes no time to
do especially once you get the hang of
it you just kind of do it so fast and I
actually used to do this back in the day
like after I was done gym class and my
hair was like if I were to be able to
shower afterwards and my hair was a
little bit damp I would just did that
really quick because afterwards when it
dries it gives like the nicest waves and
it's so pretty and then this actually
looks like it took so much time when it
literally took like that and I know it
might seem confusing at first but trust
me it's like braiding it's like takes
two seconds you know like once you know
how to just do a regular braid you can
just do it with your eyes closed this is
the same thing and again you can just
decide whether you want to pull it out
or not but I like it and then you have
the little Curly's at the bottom from
the extensions and it's so pretty
so I'm gonna end the video here with
this one this being the last one again
