snapchat which you should by the way cuz
it's fun little self promo if you do
follow me on snapchat you know that
sometimes I like to do like smoothie
recipes and you know that I love
drinking smoothies and making smoothies
and I get so many questions from you
guys on Twitter to make a video about my
smoothies so usually I'll like take a
picture of all the ingredients and then
you guys will like screenshot it and
send me that and be like make a recipe
for this so I figured you know what I'll
just take three my favorite smoothies
and just make this video for you guys
you can see exactly what i use in my
smoothies obviously if you don't like
certain things you can substitute for
different ingredients it's not like this
is the way you have to do it this is
just what I like but without further ado
let's just get into video
for my first smoothie I call this just a
regular green smoothie it's super good
before you workout or after you were
Carol it just really hydrates you and
replenishes your body with everything
that you're lacking after a workout or
before and just basic nutrients so my
favorite thing is kale with some green
apple there's just two green apples
sliced up some frozen pineapple frozen
mango you can also add frozen peach
which is really good as well I'm going
to add in a thing of celery because I
like the added taste of it but you guys
don't have to if you don't want to and
basically I'm going to juice the Apple
and the celery and then in a blender
afterwards I'm going to mix it all
together and because this is frozen
fruit it's going to make it more live
that smoothie consistency and its really
really really good
by the way for those of you wondering i
use the breville juicer I've got this at
bestbuy like two years ago for Boxing
Day which is like uh I guess a discount
day after christmas in canada and it was
on sale and then for those of you asking
my blender is like random i got it it's
my parents actually this is the brand i
don't know where they got it but this is
the one i like to use its really good
for blending like hard things like ice
and stuff this is the coconut water that
i use it's just the Vita Coco coconut
water it's really good for just a little
bit to add some more liquid and then i
blend it up
look at that it looks like monster blood
like in goosebumps just add a straw and
you're all set so good for you guys
amazing benefits as well if you guys
find it's too sweet or too sour you can
kind of substitute with how you like I
like it a bit more sour than most people
usually if I'm making it for like my
boyfriend or whatever all odd more fruit
but I like it like this this movie I
like to call my red smoothie because it
just helped kickstart your day it's
really good first thing in the morning
as well as after a workout and it's just
like a really good replenish ur super
filling and great if you're not a fan of
beats at all I would you know replace
that with something else but i find the
beats give it the flavor and the taste
it's super healthy for you such a good
food for you guys to eat i swear even if
you don't like it just try it in this
movie i don't know i just find it tastes
amazing i know some people find it
tastes like Earth but I don't find that
at all actually so what I'm going to do
is juice the carrot the beat and the
apples and then after that going to
blend the juice with the frozen fruit as
well as a little bit more of this to
kind of give it more of the electrolytes
and stuff like that that you might be
missing from after a workout
you
added all the fruit now the rest of this
coconut stuff this you can also add chia
seeds and hand parts if you like right
now I don't feel like having that so I'm
not going to put them in but those are
great benefits for you as well if you
want to add those
this stuff is seriously it's so good and
I think this fancy glass suits it pretty
well actually and if you want to make it
even more fancier you can add a little
strawberry on the end like that they'll
be super cute okay so for the next one
this is more of a desert smoothie but
it's really good so you just need one
cup of pitted dates so any dates you
find at your grocery store you need a
cup of non-fat yogurt this is just plain
Greek yogurt saw a cup of milk I'm using
soy milk and then some ice of course to
give it that smoothie consistency and
just like a little dash of vanilla
extract this is the vanilla extract that
I use yours blood it all in a blender
and it tastes like a chocolate smoothie
it's so good like a vanilla chocolate
smoothie I love it you know those like
Wendy smoothies there that's what i find
it tastes like all the ingredients are
put in and then just blend away
so these are the finish touches let me
know in the comments which one you think
would be your favorite the desert one
the red one or the green one and if you
do try out any of these smoothies then
please let me know by 20 me pictures or
living in the comments and I know I

amazing smoothies right here and they're
