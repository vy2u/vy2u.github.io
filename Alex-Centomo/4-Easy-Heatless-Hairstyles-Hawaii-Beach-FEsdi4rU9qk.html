matter how hard I'm trying to I want you
all to myself your metaphorical gin and
juice
so come on give me yes uh what it's like
to be next to you what's up guys welcome
back to my channel I'm currently in
Hawaii right now which is so crazy cuz
it's so beautiful
literally I'm looking out my window
right now and there's like massive waves
it's so cool like I just want to go play
in them so bad but I decide to film kind
of like beachy hairstyle video that you
know doesn't involve any heat things you
could do when you're on vacation if
you're going away for spring break or
something that was my phone if you are
just I don't know kind of Payton use
this back home for like lazy days or
like lazy days because you're still
doing something to your hair but they're
just really pretty hairstyles I
personally love to do when I'm on
vacation things I always do to my hair
and I get so many questions about if you
guys are curious to see how I did my
hair then just keep on watching starting
off with my first and favorite hairstyle
this is my no heat hairstyle that
actually a tutorial on a long time ago
then I'm grabbing my Lexi's that I
curled so long ago and I just like leave
them in and the curls just stay forever
which is so key because you don't have
to recrawl them all the time
and it looks so cute and so beachy I
love this hairstyle so much if you're
curious to see how I curl my hair with
no heat I'll leave the link for that
video down below it's kind of old but
the same thing I do every single time
and I love this look so freaking much
it's just so long and beautiful and Here
I am trying to be cute and pull down and
then he like tilts the camera on to the
next one this hairstyle is so freakin
cute I love wearing this in am on
vacation so you just want to make a
middle part and then you start off by
braiding little pieces by the side of
your face any angle any thickness I just
do like two braids on each side it kind
of looks weird at first but then you
incorporate it into a different
hairstyle afterwards and it looks
awesome so I actually just braid these
all the way down and I don't actually
secure them with anything
because you'll see in a second how
they'll just be incorporated into a
different braid but it adds something a
little bit different to a look and I
don't know I really like the way it
looks for a boho and beachy and it's
like perfect for a vacation that's by
the beach and then you take the section
of hair and you start braiding I do like
crossing over the middle because I just
like the look of that kind of braid
better and then with this style braid
I'm gonna braid to like maybe 3/4 of the
way down what's great about the Lexi's
is that they add so much thickness
especially if they're still curly it
looks so good when it's braided and then
the pieces hanging out are still curled
I think it looks so cute and then I pull
out some pieces make the braids look
super thick and boho and I love it so
much look at this how cute is it I love
the color of the luxe scenes as well by
the way if you're curious to see which
ones I use I'll have them linked down
below that you can check them out as
well as a coupon code but there are
custom colored because I want them to
match exactly my hair and here is what
they look like with a cute little outfit
love it so much I think it's so cute
that was a cool little transition there
did you see what it did did you see
so this hairstyle is something I've been
doing a lot lately and what you need to
do is grab a little section on top of
your head and then you're gonna start
braiding it like a Dutch braid behind
your head
just do a few strands not a lot at all
so like not French touching just like
the first three strands you want to like
French Dutch I don't know if I'm
explaining it properly but just kind of
like look what I'm doing so it's like
some hair up some hair down but you're
not gonna go all the way down and then
you're just going to pull apart that
braid make it look real thick and cute
and you can actually just leave it like
that if you want and actually looks
really nice but something that I've been
liking to do which is my little dance is
braid the rest of my hair so I'm
braiding it over the middle strand or
under the middle strand if you're
looking at from the front and then
pulling that apart using clear elastics
to secure everything together and then
I'm going to take the top section and
wrap that around the top of my braid and
kind of connect it together so you can
either use a bobby pin to secure in
place I unfortunately didn't have one so
I just used a clear elastic to kind of
secure it and then you got this like
really intricate crazy braid that looks
so cool and I get so many questions
about it so I decide to show this for
you guys and I think it looks so messy
and beachy I think it's so cute I feel
like I'm mermaid when I have it on so
this is the final look I love it I think
it's so pretty
and it would actually be really cute for
like a nice dinner or even a wedding if
it's like a boho wedding I think this is
so nice so I love it onto my fourth and
final look this is so requested ever
since I posted a picture on Instagram
with like a crazy messy bun so I either
use my extensions or not the extensions
add a lot of thickness and volume to the
bun so this one's extra messy so all you
got to do is just like throw it up and
you just wrap your elastic around and
make it as messy as possible sometimes I
add like a scrunchie to keep it in place
you can put bobby pins anywhere the
Messier the better I kind of like when
it hangs down low because I think it
looks super cute but
just I don't know I pull some strands
out everywhere and just looks so messy
and so cute keeps the hair out of your
face and you can do whatever you want on
the beach but I love it so much so this
is one of my favorites to do when I'm on
vacation
so hope you guys enjoyed the video don't
