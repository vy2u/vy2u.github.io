another hair tutorial I know I did one
previously in my blog but there was no
video and I got a lot of questions
asking how I did certain things just
because the pictures weren't as detailed
as a video is so today I'm going to show
you a couple different hairstyles that I
like to do when I'm in a rush to go
somewhere personally my hair is never
like this it's never star like this just
this is just from yesterday I slept on
it so it's second day hair if any of you
guys are wondering my hair is normally
like such a mess like I wake up and I
look like a Hawaiian I usually throw my
hair up on a bun but lately I've been
liking to do a lot of different kind of
boho looking hairstyles that are quick
and easy simple to do and look great
with any outfit or if you're going
anywhere shopping work school anything
like that so yeah if you guys are
interested just keep on watching and
let's get started so what you guys will
need for this tutorial are a couple of
hair elastics I just got these at my
local drugstore they're just um blonde
they're the same color as my hair so
that when I put my hair up there I do
certain things they blend in the next
thing you guys will need are some bobby
pins so these ones again just my hair
color so they blend in and then you guys
will need a couple of tiny elastics like
this normally I get clear ones but they
are out and I needed them so I just got
white ones you're not going to be
keeping them in your hair so it's not a
big deal just to kind of like hold
things in place so the first hairstyle
I'm going to show you guys is from the
first picture that I posted and it's
kind of like a boho half-up half-down
look so yeah the first thing that you're
gonna do is side which side of the face
you want to start braiding on I like the
right side of my face just because I'm
right-handed and it's easier for me to
do so what I'm going to do pull all my
hair to the other side
you're gonna leave one strand out that's
close to your face and then
another strand right near the root make
it kind of small I'm going to take it
and you're just going to braid this
piece so divide it into three strands if
you guys don't know how to braid and
this little guess will just be a quick
tutorial I like to go from I go
underneath the middle strand like this
so if you guys can see
okay when I go to near the end what I'm
gonna do is take one of the small
elastics and secure it the next thing
you're gonna do is you're gonna take
this braid and you're just kind of kind
of make it bigger so you're just gonna
separate it as much as you can just like
this pull out strands to make it bigger
okay so the next step that you're gonna
do once this is all pulled out is you're
going to take the Strand next to this
one that you left out previously and I'm
going to take another one that's next to
the braid on the opposite side and what
you're gonna do is you're gonna start
braiding these three pieces together and
what you want to do is you want to braid
depending on which way you want to clip
your hair so if you're going to you know
like leave your hair down you would
break downwards but what I'm gonna do is
I'm going to be clipping it up like this
so I'm gonna braid it away from my face
so just in the direction that you want
to clip it that way the braid stays in
place and when I get to the place where
I originally put the elastic I'm just
gonna pull it out and then what I'm
gonna do is secure this behind my head
with a bobby pin securing it into place
I like to use two bobby pins in like an
X shape just so that stays in place so I
don't know if you can see so far just
looks like that
the next thing that you're going to want
to do is once this is braided and
secured you're going to take the Strand
that you left down that's close to the
side of your face you're gonna braid
this and just make it kind of loose
and you're going to kind of just pull it
out like so
big loose braids then you're going to
bring it back behind and with another
bobby pin you're just going to pin it
and then what you're going to do since
this is a half-up half-down hair look
you're going to take one of your
elastics to whatever color hair you want
or whatever lastic you want it's your
choice you're going to take the hair
that's right as the clips are secured
and from the other side the same place
you're just going to pull it back and
what I like to do is - right now I'm
just going to take out the bobby pins
make sure you have all the hair that you
want up into a ponytail like so you're
going to grab a strand of hair from this
side and you're just going to braid that
what you're going to do with this side
is you want to braid it so that it can
go around the crown of your head just
like this and behind your bangs so
you're going to braid it upwards like
this
what you're gonna do is you're just
going to secure it over your head like
this you're going to tuck it underneath
this braid here so I like to go through
top one like that you have your messy
half up half down hairstyle boho chic
kind of looking very I guess beachy
whatever you call this I just think this
is so cute this hairstyle looks great on
any length
right now I have medium hair I used to
have long hair and it looked great with
that other thing you can do is instead
of having your hair parted in the middle
you can have it parted to the side and
then instead of having the the part
going all the way back like I did you
can you know stop it right after the
braid and kind of tease the underneath
and make it all going back like that so
it's more of like a a poof and then you
you don't really have a part in it I
like the part just because it looks more
like hippy style my hair right now is
it's like a blonde ombre so it looks a
little different when my roots are
darker than my tips but I actually kind
of like that with it looking more blonde
over here but yeah so this hairstyle
does not take long it takes around five
minutes to do it's just a couple braids
putting your hair up and it's so cute
guys like I love this hair oh the next
hairstyle I'm gonna do is called the
side twist so it's kind of a spin-off of
the fishtail braid and I know the
fishtail braid for some people can take
kind of a long time for me it's super
easy super quick but this is like a dupe
for it just in case you find it hard to
do the fishtail so I bring all my hair
to one side and what I do is I just
split it in two like that making sure
the sides are kind of even and then the
next step is you just simply twist your
hair both sides I like to twist towards
each other you can twist any way you
want so when you get around halfway down
you're going to stick your finger
through each strand
this one too and then you let go you
pull apart like that and then you keep
twisting so twist around half way stick
your finger through like this pull apart
twist again
then I take my elastic secure it then
pull some strands out but I kind of like
it just like this and you can see it's
really really cute kind of a spin off to
the fishtail braid but you can either
leave it like this or what I like to do
is just kind of make it Messier so I
kind of just pull out it a little bit so
it's just the hairstyle it's called the
side twist or the next hairstyle which I
love to do is just a normal low bun in
the back of your head so I'm just going
to turn out a few guys I just take my
hair like this and then I just twist it
around like so so it looks like a little
bun like this so like that just secure
it
you little loose that's it super simple
really cute and yeah okay so the next
one that I have to do I have to stand up
to show you guys so yeah I don't know if
I'm gonna be able to do this let me just
see
it's actually just a bun on top of your
head you can either use a sock to make a
sock bun and whatever bun you prefer but
the twist is that there's going to be a
French braid going up the back of your
head into the button so this is how I do
it
flip all your hair over and you're going
to start braiding so I take the back
section start braiding this each time
you braid you're going to take a new
section of hair
just until you get right here you're
going to secure it put this elastic
take all your hair up like this you're
gonna secure it into a ponytail again I
so and then you can either twist all
your hair so it goes around the button
like this secure it with bobby pins or
what I like to do is um put a soft one
so I got my sock head over slowly just
pull it around that is the sock line
just pull some hair out to make it look
a little that's here it's just how I do
my sock bun looks like this and from the
side back and yeah if you want the
French braid to be tighter than just
French braid tighter for me I like it
really loose so and kind of twist you
looking a bit messy but it's really nice
when you have like a full-on French
braid going up I just prefer it like
this and yeah so I really hope you
