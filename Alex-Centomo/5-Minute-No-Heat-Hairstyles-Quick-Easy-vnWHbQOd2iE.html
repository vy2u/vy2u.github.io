do a really quick and easy hairstyle
video for you guys I get so many
questions on my Instagram account and on
YouTube from you guys asking me to do
heatless hair tutorials and I love not
using heat on my hair and ever since I
stopped you guys know my hair has grown
a ton so I came up with four different
hairstyles that take literally five
minutes to do you don't need heat they
all include braids I know you guys love
when I do braids I love doing braids as
well and I feel like there's so many
tutorials on YouTube but I never really
do them on my channel and like I do them
all the time on Instagram so I decide to
do that so if you are curious to see how
I create these hairstyles then just keep
on watching I'm starting out with
freshly washed hair from the night
before and I do not put anything in it
just natural and I'm using my luck see
hair extensions because I want to add a
lot of volume to my hair and if you're
curious to see any kind of cool
hairstyles or how I apply these
extensions into my hair you can check
out the luxy hair channel because I did
a few videos for them so which is so
exciting I'll have links down below for
you guys but just look how much
thickness and volume this adds to my
hair I love it it's so nice and they
match perfectly with my hair so for this
first hairstyle I saw this on Pinterest
somewhere and I just absolutely love it
it's so fast to do so all you're going
to do is start off with a side part I
like to bring a little piece in front of
my face and then you're going to split
it into two sections and you're going to
kind of twist them together going
inwards and then you're going to begin
to fishtail this so you're just going to
take a small section from one side and
crisscross that over to the other side
and just continue like this
all the way down making sure that you
are pulling the braid quite tight when
you are fishtailing and the whole reason
why you twist is so that the fishtail
doesn't start close to the part it kind
of starts where you begin to twist and
they just look like they took a long
time to do when they literally take two
seconds and yeah I get so many questions
every time I wear this hairstyle so I
figured I would do this for you guys
then you are going to begin pulling out
the fishtail you want to be generous
when you're pulling it out because you
really want to be thick
and then you're going to wrap that
around with a clear elastic and pull out
even more to make the fishtail look
super massive and bohemian and there you
have it I love this look so much it's so
simple and takes like two seconds to do
but it looks so awesome and it would be
really cute at school as well
this next look is quite simple as well
once you get the hang of it it's like so
easy but it's kind of hard to explain
but I actually did this look on
Instagram I think a week ago and I got
so many questions on how I do it so as
you saw before I just split my hair into
three sections and then I'm taking half
of my hair on top and just twisting that
into a messy top knot button thing like
the half hair up kind of thing and then
I'm taking the middle section from the
three before and I'm just gonna start
braiding that all the way down and then
pulling that braid out just go crazy
with the braid as well like you did
before
you can do a fishtail braid or a regular
braid this just adds a little something
bohemian to the look and then you're
going to take that front section and
you're actually going to twist it around
the bun and then you're going to secure
it in place but it's going to kind of
look like you have a long bang and then
you're going to take the bottom section
of your hair and let it hang and the
reason why I love using extensions for
this is because it makes your hair look
so thick and beautiful and I love it so
much this next look is probably one of
my favorites to do when I have greasy
hair and also when I just want to keep
the hair out of my face so you're going
to take a section on the side of your
head and you're actually going to split
that into three so keeping a section
near your part a section near the top of
your ear and then the middle section
you're gonna actually start French
braiding but like a Dutch French braid
so you're gonna go underneath the middle
strand I know this looks kind of
confusing but it makes sense in a second
don't worry guys and then you're gonna
continue just the three strand braid all
the way down
of course like before you're just going
to begin to pull it out and secure it
with a clear elastic you don't have to
pull it out I just think this looks best
and more messy and bohemian and then
you're going to take a clear elastic and
tie a ponytail kind of at the back of
your neck so it's a low pony but you're
going to bring out some pieces and mess
up the ponytail a ton give yourself some
volume and look at that a really messy
crazy ponytail that took two seconds to
do and you have this really cute braid
and I just love it so much so much
volume guys
this last look always gets me so many
questions every time I do it but is like
the easiest thing ever so you're going
to split your hair into two second lip
sections making the back section a lot
bigger and then split the front section
into two again and then you're going to
a coarse braid that middle section all
the way down securing it with a clear
elastic and then pulling out the braid
surprise surprise something different
jokes but seriously loving the pulling
out braids then you're going to take
that back section and you're going to
fishtail it but you're going to do like
an inverted fishtail so you're going to
go underneath instead of on top all the
way down and then secure that with a
clear elastic again and then go crazy
pulling it out I'm not joking guys like
really make it messy you want it to be
really thick and then you're going to
take just a small section from the front
of your face and tie that around the
braid and then you're going to secure it
with a bobby pin in the back and then
secure the regular braid on top of the
fishtail it looks like this crazy
intricate braid that looks like it took
you forever but literally took you five
minutes and just looks so cute and easy
to do I love it so much
so I hope you guys enjoyed this video if
