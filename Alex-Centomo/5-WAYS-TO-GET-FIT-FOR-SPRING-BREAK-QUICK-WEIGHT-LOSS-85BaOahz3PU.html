cuz I literally have you balanced on a
chair and a plate in a Kleenex box and
it's kind of wiggling so hopefully this
stays in place but girl's gotta do what
a girl's got to do in a hotel room
what's up guys welcome back to my
channel hi yeah go for it I don't know
like interrupt your video Kat and I just
had so much fun filming on snapchat I'm
really sick right now so I like how to
burst of energy so I'm just gonna sit
down and film this video while I can I'm
really congested so I apologize but
let's get going
I've been getting so many questions on
Instagram lately especially about how to
work out kind of on vacation how to get
fit for spring break or just how to get
fit quickly kind of thing so I have some
tips and tricks I'm going to teach you
guys that helped me get motivated and
get fit in a kind of short amount of
time without further ado let's get
started
tip number one is accessories
accessories are always important because
they really helped motivate me when you
have a cute outfit you feel really
confident you want to show it off it
really helps I find every time I get
like a new pair of leggings or a new
sports bra or new workout top I'm always
like kind of wanting to show it off or
whatever you want to make sure you have
the right type of shoes because I see
this all the time people just buy shoes
that are cute and then work out and they
get like ankle problems or shin splints
or whatever it is they always help you
find like the right shoe for your foot
type and also for what you want to be
doing exercise wise so make sure you
have good support on your feet a water
bottle and hair ties make sure that you
are comfortable in all aspects so right
now it is that time of month and I know
it's always discouraging when you are on
your period because it's like you feel
bloated you feel grow
you can't move around as much and making
sure that you have the right fit and
comfort for you is always important and
will also help you get off your butt and
get motivated this video is in
collaboration with OB tampon I've been
using them for the past I'd say two and
a half years when I first discovered
them they're small but mighty and look
how small this is you guys it looks
really tiny but this absorbs so much and
you can move around you could do
whatever you wanted you and you don't
feel it it's comfortable it's so easy to
bring these around because like you
could literally put them in your pocket
it's really really good for the
environment because look how much less
packaging there is so less waste think
about it this way every time you use one
OB tampon you are actually adding one
less applicator to a landfill or the
ocean this design actually expands to
fit your unique body well I really do
recommend especially when you are trying
to be fit trying to be motivated and
going to the gym and you start that time
of month it also if you guys want a free
box of OB tampons make sure you click
the link down below tip number two is to
try out hip workouts HIIT that actually
really gets your body moving it gets you
to burn fat really fast and I think this
is perfect a few weeks before a like
beach vacation or something find some
YouTube videos to do or go on Pinterest
there's always really awesome workouts
and you can just follow along perfectly
I find this works the best for me when
it comes to fat burning and toning up so
definitely recommend that and if you're
already on vacation you want to continue
working out then you can just do it in
your hotel room because you literally
need no equipment tip number three is to
find a friend and I don't mean in
everyday life I mean like a workout
buddy so I always get way more motivated
when I am working out with somebody who
is also motivated because you help each
other let's say after school or after
work or over the weekends whenever you
guys have free time just to get together
for like an hour an hour and a half do a
workout you'll feel really good
afterwards and it's always fun that way
because then you just like have your
friend with you and if you guys are
already on vacation I suggest like
playing volleyball on the beach going
swimming going for hikes maybe a nice
little jog in the morning time always
better to be with somebody in my
personal preference experience
preference tip number four is to eat
healthy so I'd say around
a month or three weeks before I go
anywhere I really try and limit my sugar
intake so and by sugar I mean like not
fruit and natural sugars I'm talking
about like you know cookies cake things
that are not that great for you cutting
out your sugar intake will actually make
you lose fat pretty quickly and then
also drink a ton of water that is so
important because obviously your body is
made up of almost all water and so you
need to hydrate yourself you're gonna
thank me later even if you like fill
onefold water bottle in a day and you
drink that whole lotta bottle in a day
like if you cannot drink water try that
out at first and if you are fine with
drinking water have like three or four
of those bottles throughout the day no
soda no coffee drinks or whatever like
literally just drink a bunch of water
and it's so good for you and then also
make sure to have your greens so the
darker the leaf the better but if you
really can't do like let's say kale or
like vegetables or whatever you can
actually incorporate them into a
smoothie with a bunch of fruit whatever
it might be to make it taste a lot
better and you'll be able to get your
veggies in that way because so many
vitamins and minerals in that and
actually really good for you the fifth
and final tip is to set goals so I don't
mean like massive goals like I want to
lose 20 pounds in a month because that's
unrealistic but I mean setting small
goals like this week I'm gonna go for a
run three times whenever you have time
set a goal like that achieve it when you
start to achieve your goals you're gonna
feel a lot more motivated and then you
can set bigger goals and you kind of
work up gradually like that so I mean
you start with baby steps and you work
your way up and I think it's like the
best way in order to make yourself
Faison fits especially for spring break
because that is usually a time where
everyone wants to like show off their
bought in a bikini and you want to look
all fit and stuff so a big thing when it
comes to staying motivated to workout
when you are traveling or when you're
super busy is to just find time in the
day that instead of like sitting on the
couch and watching an episode get up and
do something so for example at a really
swamped day today like I had
back-to-back meetings I'm jet-lagged
I'm really tired I have a cold but I
told myself you know what that doesn't
matter because health always comes first
and staying active is the best thing for
you in the long run I mean short term is
great too but it literally releases
endorphins in your brain and that makes
you happier so if you feel like you're
going through a time in your life where
you're a little sad feeling down and
motivated all it takes is for you to
just get up make a goal one week every
single day go for a 10-minute walk next
week hey a 20-minute walk I know what
it's like to feel unmotivated trust me
and don't beat yourself up if you aren't
able to accomplish it every single day
just know about you're trying the first
day you do it it's a first step to
improving yourself so yeah that's all I
have to say uh
