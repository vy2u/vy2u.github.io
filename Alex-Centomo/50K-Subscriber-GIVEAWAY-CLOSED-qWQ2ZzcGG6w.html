video kind of quick just because there's
a huge thunderstorm outside right now
and the lightning is intense the thunder
is intense and I'm kind of scared just a
little bit and also this is like the
only time I have to film this video so
if you hear any crazy noises I'm so
sorry about that anyways that being said
let's get into the rest of the video so
as you can tell by the title of this
video I'm sure you guys have all known
already but I hit 50,000 subscribers on
youtube which honestly is insane I never
thought in a million years that I would
get that many followers on YouTube um
it's just it's going faster than my
Instagram right now I'm just like over
the moon and I love you guys all so much
you're so supportive and you love
everything I do and it just makes me so
happy and it makes me want to continue
doing more videos for you so as you guys
know I love to do giveaways because I
love giving back to you so this is going
to be my 50,000 subscriber giveaway and
obviously I will do what again at a
hundred thousand subscribers but for
right now I just want to say a huge
thank you to everyone for subscribing to
me for watching my videos for liking my
videos for supporting me and everything
I'm doing whether it be Instagram
Twitter Tumblr everything like that I'm
just I I like my heart just feels like
it's going to explode so thank you guys
all so so much for that anyways let's
get into what you could be waiting so
I'm going to be giving away stuff from
brandy melville and stuff from fresh
tops because that's did you hear that
it's at the end of the world I swear the
last time i did my giveaway most of you
seem to really like the items that I
away from brandy melville and fresh top
so I just figured why not because I love
those two stores and you seem to like
them as well so I guess starting off
with Brad Melville because obviously
it's everyone's fave I have this top
it's just a regular halt halt then
halter top but um it's not really
picking up on camera but this actually
like a light pink color it's not white
it's very light pink it's really really
cute especially with a cute tan it's
super nice so just a regular halter top
it's a little bit crop but not so much
if you're wearing high waisted shorts
it's perfect because it covers
everything and I just really like this a
lot i'm a huge fan of halter tops this
parrot is like a choker necklace is like
oh yeah the next thing you guys will be
running from brandi is this knitting top
so these tops seem to be super popular
right now Brandi the stripe kind of like
loose-fitting tight-fitting I don't even
know how explain this because it's like
tight on shoulders with Lucifer or else
anyways this like little t-shirt it's um
not really a crop shirt it goes just to
around the pad line so if you're wearing
Louis it pads it might show just like a
little bit of skin but not really it
doesn't cover the butt or anything like
that but it's not a crop top so I just
really like these colors a lot it's like
a maroon striped with a navy blue stripe
and a white stripe and then like on the
ends there's just the white on the
border and I just think this is super
cute pair to some really nice boyfriend
jeans is like so cute and a jacket plus
these colors are really in for the fall
so this could be useful for the fall as
well now the next top you guys all
really seem to like on my Instagram so I
figured I'd pick one up for you guys as
well is this top right here so it's like
that baseball tee kind of top is
three-quarter length sleeves so it
doesn't go all the way down your arm it
stops like maybe right here and this one
is not the crop one although it's not
long it's like the need to the Nadine
top and showed it's like I mean it's not
a long top and it has this really cool
like tribal thing in the front I don't
really know if you guys can pick it up
but i think it's like super cool here
there so you can kind of see that it's
really nice so the last thing from
brandi is this tie dye crop shirt I
don't really know how to explain this
it's like a t-shirt but not it's kind of
like a muscle shirt but it has a bit of
sleeves but they look like they've been
like cut off or ripped off or something
is really cool and it's just a tie dye
color it's really neat and this would
really go well in the summer or the fall
so that's pretty sweet because of the
dark colors and again it goes well with
any skin tone so that's the next thing
you guys will be winning now on to fresh
tops so the first thing I'm going to be
giving away is the
shirt and it's the muscle t-shirt that
says can you not it's again not really
crop but it's not super long the
material of fresh tops is so different
than anything I've ever felt it's very
very soft like braggy but it's like it's
almost like a thicker material i don't
know i really like it they're super easy
to wash and they never shrink just don't
really put them in the dryer for that
long I would hang to dry yeah so you'll
just get this one that says can you not
I think it's really funny and I say
that's saying a lot I'm sure you've seen
my pictures with the shirt the next one
is just a cropped tee this one is crop
and it's the one that says hahahahaha
know so I just think this one's really
funny plus you guys all really seem to
want me to give us away in my last
giveaway so I figured okay you know what
I want to thank you guys so I'm going to
give this t-shirt away I haven't worn it
not a lot I think I've worn it twice
since i purchased it so you will be
winning something that I've kind of worn
but it's washed I promise and it's like
practically brand new you know it looks
like there's nothing on it so yeah and
then these two tops that I own as well
but I figured I'd get another one for
you guys because you guys all seem to
love it so much the first one is this
cropped tank top like this and it's the
one that says boys and books are just
better which is totally true because I
mean Augustus waters like please just
nothing else to be said about it guesses
waters and then the last thing that you
guys will be winning from fresh hops is
the same style t-shirt so it's the crop
tank top but this one says hello I am
divergent and I freaking love this
because I'm obsessed with divergent um
the books were amazing the movies are
really good as well I mean the first one
sees the only one that I've seen because
it's the only one that's out right now
but like Theo James is just really hot
and I really really like it a lot plus I
mean if I was in divergent i'm pretty
sure i would be divergent because there
is no way i could be like one of
anything so this top is perfect for me
and you guys all really seem to like it
as well so i'm going to be giving this
away now on to the rules of the skip
away so because this is not like a huge
huge huge giveaway where I'm having
two different winners there's just going
to be one winner for this giveaway
because I will be doing a giveaway out
of hundred thousand subscribers and that
one is going to be much bigger with more
winners but this one I want to know

someone more personal or somewhere
random last time you guys I had two
winners and one of them you wanted me to
pick someone random at someone personal
this time there's only one winner so let
me know in the comments below on what
you want me to do random obviously is
just easier because I just pick a random
number and it's just going to be like
that something personal is more like
someone that really really comments a
lot that I noticed their name that shows
me so much support that you know talks
to me all the time and is like I mean
you guys are all giving me so much
support so that's actually really hard
so but I mean if that's what you guys
