welcome back to my welcome back to my
channel I'm sick so like my voice
Valentine's Day so I grew up hating this
day because in school I would never get
any Valentine's Day cards or lollipops
or whatever it was for my knees the boys
or anyone I would never get anything and
then I never had a boyfriend and it was
just always like you know a date to
remind me that I was in fact alone and
then when I was like 18 I went I took my
best friend out for Valentine's Day I
like picked her up with flowers and a
card in chocolate and we had like
romantic dinner we went out for dinner
was so fun and then I realized like this
day is so stupid because now that dad
and I have been together for six years
and we are getting married I realized
that we never even celebrate this day
it's a very rare that we do I know what
it's like to feel the pressure on both
ends you're in a relationship and you
feel like you have to do something
special if you're not in relationship
and you feel like oh my god I'm so alone
I get both sides and to be completely
honest when you're with someone that you
love everyday should be like Valentine's
Day I'm not just saying that to be
cheesy but in all honesty I don't feel
like I need a specific day to like
express my love for Dan we do it all the
time throughout the year but sometimes
it is fun to dress up and go out even if
it's with your girlfriends even if they
come over to your house and you make
dinner and you still want to dress up
and be fancy I used to do that too it's
fun I always like a reason that to get
done up because it just makes me feel
really good this video can apply to all
of you girls out there all of you guys
without further ado let's just get into
the video just putting my hair up I
still have my curls from earlier so I'm
just gonna keep them like that but I'm
starting off using this product right
here this is the Kiehl's powerful
strength line reducing concentrate I
actually use this as a makeup primer
because it fills in the fine lines and
pores and makes your skin look so
airbrushed with makeup on it so I really
like it for that reason I just do like a
small amount Giorgio Armani luminous
silk foundation so good I use the shade
does that make sense seven point seven
five four seven seven I mean five point
seven five or five seventy-five I always
feel like I have to work fast because
this stuff like drips off my hand
because it's very liquidy
but I love the finish it gives no boo oh
my god
stream Aggies ooh like heart-shaped tape
I'll be always a must I do a little bit
under my eyes power on my nose and the
bridge and the my chin and one spot I
know like I shouldn't be touching my
spots with this I know and it spreads
your zits and I always preach that but
I'm being real do any of you guys
actually really genuinely every single
time put the product on your hand or do
you put it directly on your spot like be
real every single time if you do that's
amazing
mad respect oh no oh my god now he's
eating my extensions what no I'm just
going to add some I'm not translucent
but like fine powder to the place that I
just put concealer to set it this is the
park half princess bronzer by Tarte big
brush from Tarte as well and just apply
this to the apples / hollows of my
cheeks and bringing it up onto my temple
I like really messy when it comes to
this stuff because when you blend it all
out it looks really nice and just kind
of dabbing it everywhere so it matches
the rest of my body then into the eyes
orbán decay heat palette I'm going to be
using three different shades so I'm
starting off with chaser this one right
here it's a good nude color I'm just
gonna apply that all over my lid just as
a base and to add some like depth and
shadow because I do have very hooded
eyes so like they're a little bit like
Asian eyes so when I close my eyes I
don't have like a full eyelid so it's
really hard to see my eyeshadows when I
am wearing them so I always have to like
put them higher then I just blend out
and I create like this brown shade here
to act as like a shadow as if like I had
more eyelid because then you can
actually see the colors and it looks
really nice then I'm gonna be going in
with dirty talk so it's like this
coppery Brown ish color my descriptions
suck but I really like this color and
I'm going to be applying this mainly in
the outer corner and into my crease but
I eventually
you'll end it all the way over my eyelid
it's just like I focus it more on the
outside also I am no means a makeup
artist I actually really suck at makeup
but I figured I would show you guys what
I'm going to be rocking the cell tines
day I also bring it underneath a little
bit and then I do the same thing on the
other side and then I take the same
exact brush because I'm lazy and I don't
really care and I'm going in with
scorched which is a shimmery coppery
brownish purple color and I'm gonna be
applying that kind of all over the lid a
little bit in my crease but it just adds
a really nice shimmer I avoid my inner
corner because that's when I go in with
my like highlight I'm just using this
like super old one soft and gentle macro
neuralyzed skin finish it's still really
nice I apply it to the tip of my nose
Cupid's bow this from NYX don't know
what it's called I just use one side of
it for my eyebrows and I have been
getting my eyebrows threaded so thank
you so much for all of your super sweet
comments saying my eyebrows have been
looking really good lately because I
have actually been going to a
professional versus me trying to be on
my own and failing completely set them
in place eyeliner man-eater by tarte boo
I swear oh boo I'm trying to do my
winged eyeliner oh my god do you mind
stop maybe I said guys you know why it's
you excuse me
No
this is actually what happens unless I'm
standing up really okay so I messed up a
little bit because hmm you know why
that's okay this is enough to be perfect
as for mascara I've been using this one
voluminous lashed paradise by Maybelline
I don't know this was sent to me like a
long time ago it's actually really dried
out but I like it cause it's the only
freakin mascara that that doesn't smudge
on my face every mascara smudges every
single one except for this one and this
one's not even waterproof so I don't
understand their formula but it's so
good it's either L'Oreal or Maybelline I
should really know that watch it be like
covergirl it's definitely drugstore
though they ask you how you are you just
have to say that you're fine when you're
not really fun now as for lips I do my
classic lip that I do every single day
and every single video I wear this exact
lip combination it is the Charlotte
Tilbury lip liner in iconic nude liquid
lipstick Kat Von D bow and arrow oh the
bomb I've been using this for like a
year and a half and I still haven't run
out and every time I wear makeup this is
why I wear sometimes like very rare once
in a while where the Kylie lip kit in
Malibu but this is usually my go-to
we're going to move on to the hair okay
so if you're wondering how I got these
curls I use a straightener and if you're
confused as how to do that I actually
have my most viewed video on YouTube is
how to curl your hair with a
straightener and they last for days at
least for me like my hair texture my
hair type and yeah totally can leave it
like this but this is Valentine's Day
and not that I ever really celebrate it
to be completely honest because dad and
I we're not really about that life but
we do really like to once in a while go
out for dinner or so I do want to be an
extra bit hmm and in order to do that I
need what boo was chewing earlier which
are my extensions I keep them in this
little duffel bag because it just keeps
them nice and neat these are the same
extensions I use in every video that I
use extensions for you guys are new here
the ones I use are by luxy hair
they are my go-to extensions I recommend
them 110 percent they're so good the
Brad behind them is amazing now I do
have a custom length because they used
to have really long lengths like years
ago and I used to always purchase those
ones the other length that's almost like
this is a million times better and I
actually cut these because they were a
little on the long side so I feel like
this is almost the length the longest
length that they have and these are
these seamless collection so they're
like they're really thin ones so they're
super flat against your head and you do
not see them which I really like because
like pet peeve is when you see people's
extensions I just hate it there are the
blonde volumes
these are a little bit more light the
roots but that's because in the summer
my hair over here gets so light it
almost matches this it's actually crazy
the difference of how dark my hair gets
in the winter because they just never
see sunlight
I by no means say you need to wear
extensions for this hairstyle but it
does definitely help because my hair is
very fine although I have a lot of hair
when I put it in like a ponytail like
all my hair in one the ponytail itself
is very thin like there's not much hair
in it so curls definitely help give a
lot more volume to my hair but the
length with the extensions and the
volume together is just like honestly
anywhere I go when I wear my extensions
people literally are like
your hair is amazing all the time
they're like oh my god
all I get are questions about my hair
even on Instagram if I post pictures
with my extensions Hebrew like holy crap
your hair oh I also if you don't know
how I'm putting in my extensions I do
have a lot of videos how to do that on
my channel so I'll have like links down
below for how I did my hair and how I
put extensions in I just hit myself in
the face pretty simple but I'll show you
guys like that's a pretty big difference
and once they're all blended because I
put them up like this in layers how nice
is that like honestly I know like
everyone's putting their health right
now but long hair will always be in
because it's always beautiful and always
nice so for this hairstyle because I've
been obviously very into 90's lately you
guys know because I mean I don't know if
you know but if you watched my last
video you will see that everything
reminded me of something from like the
80s or 90s and this hairstyle I used to
do as a child I'm gonna do it again as
an adult who is fully engaged about to
get married
whatever I've a booger in my nose if I
don't wear my nose this whole time I'm
probably gonna cry I'm gonna be doing
two Dutch braids here in pigtails gonna
be so cute but still like romantic I
really love it and then because I have
my extensions all in like from here down
it's gonna add so much length and volume
and so it's gonna make your hair look
really long because the top parts of
your hair will be kind of up and then
it'll all connect and they look like
very ariana grande's I don't know
they'll be able to talk while I do this
but I'll give it a try I need I'm just
gonna use my finger actually I shouldn't
it's still gonna be crooked I feel it
it's like not in the middle so you're
going to like braid your hair but cross
underneath the middle sections
I feel like it's not focusing properly
like focus okay when the brain is like
at the back of your head you're gonna
take a clear elastic or elastic that
matches the color of your hair doesn't
really matter pull it nice and tight
pull out the braids oh my gosh this time
yikes and there you have this side I
like to still have pieces like covering
my ear but I mean if you didn't you can
have it like that too but I think this
looks nice
I'm gonna do the other side look how
cute I mean it's obviously really hard
for me to see in the viewfinder but this
is what it looks like I'm gonna zoom out
guys so all of the hair look how frickin
cute this is honestly I'm obsessed it's
so long can you see the top I honestly
don't know what it looks like because
it's so hard for me see in this
viewfinder also I do want to say if you
guys are curious and getting your
extensions I'll have a link listed down
below and use the code Alex in 205 for
