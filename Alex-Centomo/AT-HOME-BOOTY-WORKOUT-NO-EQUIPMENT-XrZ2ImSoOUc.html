channel as you can tell from the title
I'm doing a workout routine but this is
gonna be a little different because this
is a fall long workout routine so this
is a very simple in a sense workout that
I love to do at home you don't need any
equipment other than like a yoga mat
just so you don't hurt your back this is
gonna be a real workout so no makeup or
anything doing it at home or when you're
traveling in a hotel room it's super
simple just a quick disclaimer I am NOT
a professional I am NOT a personal
trainer I wasn't athlete growing up so
that is why I know a lot of these
exercises but I don't want you to injure
yourself so make sure if you're gonna be
doing anything have someone help you
watch your posterior form
I have Daniel helping me with mine
because I'm not the greatest so if you
see my form looking a little wonky sorry
about that this is a work in progress
for me I'm getting back into shape I'm
gonna try to do these more often so
there's gonna be one and I think every
two to three weeks I'm gonna be working
on different parts of the body if you
have any suggestions feel free to leave
them down below in the comments and this
today is about the booty let's just get
into it
that's the end of the video clearly I'm
not an expert but this is something that
I have been working on and thanks again
for showing me what to do so hope you
guys can relate because obviously not
all of us are experts and I just think
it would be cool to start this journey
together so let me know how you did in
this exercise you can adjust this by
repeating it as many times as you want
to make a workout as long as you want
obviously don't go overboard I would
usually would suggest two times but if
you want to do with three or four
totally go for it and also just keep in
mind that I like to do cardio as well as
this so if you go for like a 1520 minute
jog before head or you can just like do
jumping jacks
run in place just to get your heart rate
up and then stretch afterwards but yeah
that is it give this video a thumbs up
if you enjoyed it and also let me know
what video would like to see next if you
want to see more cardio arms arms just
whatever you would like to see and let's
start this journey together and I love
you guys so much let me know your
fitness goals I'll see you on my next
video 5 pin this abandoned amusement
park becomes a life when it turns dark
we're just carnival hearts you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
