so many questions from you guys and
requests to do more workout videos and
more healthy videos and I love making
these types of videos for you guys if
you don't know I've been very much into
working out and eating healthier lately
I went through a little bit of a plateau
but I really got myself motivated again
and I get so many questions on what to
do when you're done school and you want
to get a little bit motivated you want
to do a workout but you don't have
access to a gym you live in a dorm room
or you just want simple exercises that
will you know really help your core and
everything but that isn't too intense
but you feel like really good afterwards
and you do break a good sweat so this is
what I've been doing lately when I'm in
a rush um this is outdoors because the
weather is still nice for me but you can
take these exercises and do them in a
small confined space as well like you
can do them in your dorm room you can do
them your bedroom you do not need a gym
or anything you can literally do it
anywhere if you don't have access or
you're too uncomfortable to do it
outside because you don't have privacy I
totally get that take in mind that be
careful if this is your first time
working out you do want to adjust the
level so that you don't injure yourself
also my voice
it's just disappearing guys I don't know
why I woke up earlier this morning and I
was like where is it
I don't think eyes will be a hotel but I
could tell only thing would be that my
cardio is usually running up the hill
but when it starts getting cold outside
I like to skip rope so you guys can do
that if you guys are interested in
seeing my workout routine for back to
school or after school then just keep on
watching for my workout gear I like to
keep it simple so I'm wearing this top
from brandy melville over a Calvin Klein
bra let thingy and then I got my Nike
sneakers on with some socks and Adidas
shorts super comfy and casual it was
really hot outside today so I thought
this would be perfect before I do any
kind of workout I like to do some
dynamic stretching so this just means
that your body is moving or in movement
when you're stretching so swinging your
arms swinging your legs just getting
your muscles warmed up for any kind of
exercises that you're going to do it's
gonna help just keep everything really
like loose and so you won't injure
yourself it's actually very important to
do this before you workout so I highly
recommend it and
I know it looks kind of funny but it
it's good for you guys don't worry about
it and you can do even just like a
little dad it's not crazy if you want to
like me for my cardio lately I've been
loving to run uphill there's this place
in the area where I live where you can
just run up the hill I know it doesn't
look that hard but I go up and down ten
times and by the end my legs feel like
jello I'm not even kidding you it
doesn't really look like a running
downhill right now but I promise you I
am and it's very hard guys but I break a
sweat like crazy and I love it so these
are the exercises you can do at home
squats are very good the one thing you
want to remember is that your knees
don't go over your toes and you want to
squat down like you're sitting on a
chair trying to keep your back straight
I'm not perfect but I'm trying so good
for your butt and your legs I'm obsessed
with doing them and I do around 50 and
then I go on to 50 lunges as well and I
kind of rotate I maybe do two sets total
it honestly kind of just depends on how
I'm feeling that day but usually around
two times fifty for both now on to some
ABS this is my favourite exercise to do
for ABS I do a hundred of these and then
I take a rest and then I move on to
these like butt lifts which I really try
squeezing my butt as hard as I can as I
go up and then I do around probably 20
of these and then I go back to the other
exercise and I rotate between the two
and it just helps so much then I move on
to arms so I actually saw this exercise
on like the Blogilates youtube channel
I've been doing it ever since so you
want to make sure that you're squeezing
your forearms and fingers together and
you're going to want to go up and down
this really helps work you're like
triceps and stuff I know it doesn't
really look like much but as long as
you're squeezing as hard as you can it
helps this one as well you just want to
squeeze your hands together as hard as
you can I do around 20 each and then I
move on to ten push-ups on a table
because I suck so much and I cannot even
do one pushup on the ground even in a
girl position I'm really bad but I'm
working on it then I move on to these
like arm dips and I usually do two times
ten so I'll do ten of them take a 30
second break and then do another ten and
this works your arms like crazy and if
you live near a park try doing the
monkey bars guy
I feel like I'm five years old again but
it's actually so hard like what that guy
used to be so good at this and I'm like
dying right now oh but it's really good
for you now on to some static stretching
so this is what I like to do after a
workout which means that you're just
stretching in one movement you're not
moving that much you're in the same
position and it helps really just
stretch out your muscles so that you
won't be sore the next day because that
is a problem with mine yeah so I just do
a bunch of different stretches for
whatever exercises I did that day so
arms legs
um but anything like that I do and then
I just breathe really deep roll my
shoulders and take some deep breaths and
I feel a lot better so I hope you guys
enjoy that video like I said it's very
quick and easy simple nothing too
intense um let me know in the comments
down below if you like this type of
video if you want me to do more workout
videos maybe I could do a video just
based off of arms things to work
different muscles or abs or legs but
anything just let me know what you guys
like to see also I do have a healthy
eating video coming very soon so that is
in the works and another thing I want to
tell you guys is that I'm actually
partnering up with Pantene to take on
the Pantene expert challenge it's
basically just to change up my old
shampoo and conditioner and try out
their shampoo and conditioner from the
Pantene expert collection apparently
this is Pantene's most awarded
collection so I really want to try it
out for myself there are actually four
different collections for specific types
of hair and things you want to target
about your hair the first one I believe
is called dry defy and that actually
just helps I'm oyster into your hair
which yes the second one is fade to Phi
and that just helps prevent fading and
just helps keep the color in your hair
so that's a good one too because that
happens a lot especially when you go
blind the third one is age-defy and I
believe this one helps to fight like
seven signs or something of aging hair
so like breakage and dryness and all
that kind of stuff and the last one is
called advanced keratin repair which is
the one that I'm going to be trying
because it claims to erase two years of
damage in two
so I want to see if that actually works
because my hair as you know is pretty
damaged from all those years in the past
of like dying and using heat and it's
just like you know yeah yeah it needs
some repairs so if you guys want to take
the Pantene challenge as well you can
enter for yourself all you have to do is
comment on my video obviously or on
Instagram using one of the hashtags that
I mentioned previously for the specific
collection that you want and in a few
weeks I'll pick the winner and I will
send you the one that best suits your
hair so whichever one you think it's
best for you guys because I know a lot
of you guys have different hair not
everyone is the same so just make sure
you comment down below so that you could
try out some new hair products and also
I will be coming out with a new video in
a few weeks to let you know how it all
went how I tried it out how like what
it's done for my hair and stuff and just
let you guys know how the whole process
and challenge went because I'm so stoked
for this guys I've heard just like the
greatest things about it and I'm really
excited to bring so look it up I don't
want to show you guys but I'm excited
okay I love you guys all so much don't
forget that make sure you give this
video a big thumbs up and subscribe for
