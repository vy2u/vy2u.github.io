would sit down and finally film my video
all about extensions because I get so
many questions on a daily basis on
Instagram on Twitter on YouTube just
about my extensions and why I started
using them which ones I like the best
how to use them and all that kind of
stuff so before I get started actually I
should explain I have been one to always
kind of experiment with hair extensions
ever since I was maybe 17 I always had
like kind of short hair I used to have
hair to like just pass my shoulders and
there was a time where I had like
chopped all my hair off and it was like
to here it was disgusting and then it
finally got to here and it was all this
color like my natural color but of
course being me in high school wanted to
be all blonde
I completely bleached my whole hair so
it was like to here and I would always
straighten it and curl it and it was
just dying all the time so that was kind
of the reason why I started using hair
extensions um now I use it more for like
the fullness and less for the length
like I do use it for length for my
pictures on Instagram but like my hair
is growing like crazy the reason why I
start using hair extensions was because
I just wanted longer hair because my
hair was just not growing but that was
my fault because I was just using way
too much heat on it and dyeing it way
too much
so I would just go to like my local not
hair salon but like some local wig slash
extension shop and buy like the clip in
hair extensions that were like the real
hair I don't know they were just like
not good quality and they were always
stringy and like I just didn't know what
I was doing with them so after years and
years of like doing my research and
experimenting with different sorts of
extensions from all over the world
literally ace to order extensions from
different places I finally found a
company that I truly really like it's
always hard to kind of find extensions
that will match your hair color
perfectly so the extensions that I use
is this like so weird I'm like holding
up hair but these are the extensions I
use as you can see like they do not
match my hair at all but they completely
match my bottom
if you could see like it's like they're
exactly the same so because I have ombre
hair I do need to wear extensions that
will match the bottom or else that would
just look weird so this is the company
called
foxy locks and they're a uk-based
company but I decide to give them a go
and I absolutely love them so these are
the 24 inch 280 gram clip-in hair
extensions and they are in the shade
sandy blonde before ordering online I
said like I said just go to like my
local place and get my hair matched but
now that I order online I do find it
kind of like hard to pick the perfect
amount the perfect color for your hair
that's why I really like this company
because what they do is they send you a
package and along with the package comes
like a sample strip of hair that you're
actually allowed to take out and clip
into your hair and see how that works
and if that doesn't match you can send
it back and try it another color before
opening like the whole package of hair
extensions so that's a really cool way
to kind of like see if they match what I
really like about these extensions more
than anything else is the thickness of
them they're not like my other hair
extensions I had in the past were always
like so thin at the ends and like
stringy and like you could literally
tell in some pictures that's like that's
like those are extensions like you're
not blend and not look real oh my gosh
but these are like thick until the end
and end and they're super soft super
easy to style and store and everything
like that I don't know what they did
here but I don't know if you guys could
see but there's a thicker band on top
where they add more hair and like it's
just it sits in your on your scalp much
more comfortably than anything else I've
ever tried before and I just really like
it this looks so funny because like does
not match my hair but I swear guys it
matches the bottom foxy locks is
actually coming out with they're all my
hair extensions so I'm so excited to try
those out because as you get seen some
my pictures on Instagram it's like
because my ombre is growing out so much
because my hair is growing so fast and
it like the bottom like the underneath
here is like completely dark so when I
do attach my clip in extensions
sometimes you could see like a line and
stuff of like the blonde which is kind
of annoying but that's why I'm super
excited for their ombre extensions to
come out because then they can actually
match your root color to your and then
the bottom color together and it just
looks so good and I'm just really
excited for that because it's going to
be so much fun I do not wear extensions
on an everyday basis whatsoever at all I
love the natural length of my hair
that's why I find clip-in extensions
kind of cool because it's like you can
have short hair somedays and then you
can have long hair some other days and
it doesn't really matter and these are
so natural looking like I wear them and
in person and people are just like holy
crap your hair is so nice like thanks
you know that's all natural I'm just
kidding as for storage I know there are
like specific ways to keep your
extensions to help them like last longer
and become better what I actually do is
I just kind of like twist them like this
and then I'll put them in a little net
that actually comes in the pack and I'll
just leave them like overnight or
whatever just stored like that or if I'm
going somewhere need to bring them I
kind of just store them like that I used
to be really bad at my old extensions
just kind of like throw them in my purse
or just throw them on the floor no big
deal whatever but I do find that um they
last longer the better you take care of
them because it is like real hair you
know I'm the good thing about extensions
is that they don't actually you don't
need to like put heat on them that often
obviously you're not actually supposed
to wash them that often you're supposed
to wash them I say every 30 wears so if
you are wearing them every single day
maybe once a month and I know you might
think oh that's so gross but there's no
like there's nothing on them that gets
them super dirty and especially if you
don't put a lot of hairspray in them
then they'll be completely fine so like
if I use heat on them for a day you know
I'll curl them or something and then
they'll be good for a month or longer
just because I don't wear them everyday
if you do want to wear your extensions
everyday I would just suggest to you
know do store them properly at night
don't sleep in them and don't go
swimming in them they're not like you
can but it'll just ruin them and create
knots and stuff and I've done that
before my old extensions so I just
wouldn't do that
now as for um styling them I do use heat
protectant on them
cuz I don't want to ruin them so someone
asked best way to naturally dry them in
two styles so when I wash my extensions
I just use my shampoo and conditioner
that I use on my natural hair which is
sulfate free and more natural shampoo
and conditioner I try to choose anything
with like anything harsh in it I kind of
do my research into what products I use
and stuff so I use mainly things from
lush which are all organic and natural
and that's what I use on my extensions
as well just because that's what I use
in my natural hair and the more you do
wash your extensions the more the hair
will like fall out because it's not like
completely permanently attached in here
it's like hair on your head like it does
fall out so you do want to wash them
less so I wash them in my sink and I do
it with like lukewarm water so some you
know not too hot or anything and I just
rub it in the extension like this I
could run it through it I comb it out
with my fingers or a wide toothed comb
you never want to like take a brush and
like pull out the knots do you want to
you know treat it as if it's your own
hair and I know a lot of you guys become
lazy but if you want your extensions to
last longer that's just what you're
gonna have to do if you don't care
whatever it's your decision but this is
what I do I just lightly brush through
them and then what I do is I actually
will either lay them flat on a towel to
dry which I don't know if that's good or
not but that's working in the past or I
have this you know those like um those
hangers with the Clippy things like that
I will take them and hang them with
those Clippy things like in the air
which is probably the best thing to do
in my opinion because they just dry
naturally and they don't dry straight
they dry more of like with a wave which
is my natural hair is more wavy so it
actually looks really good when I like
mix it all together
um the thing with foxy locks is that
they're super silky and shiny like as
you can see they're like you're really
really nicely made so I just feel like
and like look at this you could see like
the thickness of the ends
they're completely thick and when I do
wear them my hair at the ends is not
like that you know like my natural hair
is not like that but then when I do wear
the extensions it makes it look like my
hair is super healthy and I get so many
compliments on my hair when it looks
like that and I'm just like why can't my
real hair
feel like that no struggle is real to
dry them into actual Styles I'd say
maybe braid the extension and let it dry
like that if you want like more of the
waves for me um I just like the way they
dry naturally just on their own lately
I've been loving to just put them in
first with my natural hair and they're
just taking random strands and curling
them with my nume wand because I used
like the really thick barrel and it just
gives it a really nice loose curl and
then I kind of gently brush it out in my
hair and it looks very natural that way
and I've been loving to do that so
another person has asked how I put them
in I just do them in section this on the
bottom and then I'll clip this one on
top of that one so they're like this on
your scalp so I personally don't
straighten my extensions ever just
because I never have my hair straight
but I'm sure it's the same thing if you
were to curl them you just need to
straighten them once I love using
extensions for braiding oh my gosh makes
your braids super thick I'm sure you
guys know about my Instagram but makes
your fishtail super thick you can pull
them out and just make super big braids
I love that look so that's what's so fun
about using extensions I've never had
extensions that were this thick this
soft this smooth this well made in a
long time and I love the clips how easy
they are just to clip in your head they
do not hurt you could barely feel them
because they're super like woven in here
properly and of course if you guys are
interested in seeing all my pictures on
Instagram you can see what they look
like how I style them and everything
like that I will leave the link down
below for you guys to check out if you
haven't already follow me on Instagram
that's mainly what I'm known for it's
it's crazy like people always ask me oh
my god your hair is amazing how does it
look that way and I'm just like foxy
locks like actually though because my
hair does not look like that it doesn't
it's not thick it's not like long it's
in the summer my hair was longer but
it was still Finn it wasn't like thick
and I love that this is thick at the
ends and it's just like healthy-looking
and I've never had that in my life so it
just makes me feel more confident and I
love especially like when I really dress
up and just having that big hair I just
really feel like like lively and it just
makes me happy because who doesn't love
Blake Lively she is incredible and
beautiful so I hope you guys enjoyed
this video I think I answered all of
like the main questions on Instagram
that I got was mostly just like what
products I used to wash them and how I
put them in and I'm definitely gonna be
doing a lot of hair tutorials and
hairstyle videos using extensions so I
didn't want to put that in this video
just because um I'm gonna be doing a lot
of those and the next upcoming months
and stuff so if you have any suggestions
please leave them down below also if you
have any more questions about the
extensions I love going through your
comments
and replying so feel free to ask any
questions you want down below also if
you're wondering what brand you should
go for I really do suggest foxy locks
I'm not just saying that like I that is
my actual honest opinion like I wouldn't
lie to you guys and you know I like
promoted a bunch of different hair
extension brands before and I just think
in my deep down opinion that I really do
like this brand just because they have
so many color selections they're coming
out with an ombre line which is amazing
they have so many different lengths if
you don't want this super long 24 inch
like this one goes all the way down to
my waist practically you know um you can
get they have different lengths they
have they don't have ones that are super
thick if you have to super thin here
they have different kinds of styles I
will leave a link to their website down
below and to their Instagram and stuff
that you can check out for yourself
because I know obviously everyone has
different hair than me not everyone has
hair like me so um if you're interested
in seeing for yourself and also remember
that you do get sent a sample so you
could try that out on your hair but I
mean there's so many shades you can look
through I am planning on doing a video
on like how I put them in plus how I
style them so if you want to see certain
hairstyles please let me know in the
comments I hope you guys are all having
a wonderful day or night wherever you
are in the world
you're like I always say that oh and by
the way while you're watching this I'm
in Barbados which is crazy because I'm
so excited to go so I'm so excited to
