up guys so in today's video I have
really random favourites because I just
haven't tried out a ton of new products
this month plus I'm going through a
weird phase where I'm into like weird
things you'll see what I mean in a
minute but basically I'm just going to
show you guys what I've been loving for
this month yes let's get into it first
thing would have to be um weirdly cut
tops so one like I'm wearing like this
that's like looks like a racerback that
you would have in the back but you're
into the front and this one's from
Brandi I really like it it's like a
sweater material and it's a light pink
or a dusty pink I'm not too sure but I
really like that and then another thing
I've been hugely into for this time of
year has been stripes if you guys follow
me on instagram which you should little
so I've been showing a ton of stripes
lately and if you know me you just know
I like stripes so the first top would
have to be this one that I just received
from Windsor it's like this see it's got
a little bit of the weirdly cut you know
tops it's a little crop and it's black
and white and I really like it next one
is from Windsor as well because I just
got it and i really like it it's just an
oversized like white with tiny black
stripes and there's a little pocket and
this is super cute with boyfriend jeans
or boyfriend jean shorts and booties and
hat love that look and then this one is
a little similar to the one I just
showed you but way more oversized this
is from brandy so this is like a big
boxy tee shirt that like my boyfriend
would be wearing but looks like I stole
from
I know and you know this was actually
$27 Canadian 23 us and then these ones
were 14 and this one was 18 all really
good Christ t-shirts in my opinion I
really like the feel of them they're all
really soft this one's a little bit more
structured but I like that and I could
totally just sleep in this and then
where the next day and no one would know
that's what I like about t-shirts the
last one that I picked up is from
Brandis well this one is $18 Canadian or
15 us looks like this and it's cropped
and it's like a dusty rosy pink color I
love it I think it's super cute I wore
this on Instagram I have yet to actually
wear this in public that's why I've been
taken off the tags kind of embarrassing
sometimes I don't know if this happens
to you guys but it happens to me quite
often I like leave my house with the tag
hanging off and then my either my sister
or my friend is like Alex you still got
your tag on him like that would have
been on all day if nobody said anything
and then since the weather is finally
getting nicer what is this piece of hair
doing oh my gosh oh my hair is just not
cooperating with me today at all um yeah
but I'm so like weird right now anyways
what I've been really enjoying wearing
leather jackets well I don't own any
real leather jackets because for one
there like a million dollars not
actually but they're super expensive and
too I just don't see the need in buying
a real leather jacket when you can get
one that's like
just as nice that's vegan leather you're
not hurting any animals I'm not a vegan
but I'm just saying and it's super cute
and structured it's actually quite old I
got this in the fall old but you know
what I mean like it's not I didn't just
purchase it is from free people it has
this hood on it that you can actually
just zip off feel like but it looks like
a sweater hood which I really like and
it's just a simple leather jacket I've
showed it on Instagram before the back
is really nice because um you can see
you can't see but basically it's got
some shape to it so it goes in like this
on your waist and it makes you look
super pretty and I like it and it's just
like the perfect leather jacket for this
time of year okay so that is all
fashion-wise now on to beauty um I
haven't been like switching out my
beauty routine that much but I was sent
a few samples or a few things from Too
Faced which I am actually obsessed with
and in my last action my last three
videos that I uploaded my makeup was
done all with these products so if you
were curious to see what my lip products
were whatever like that this is what i
use the first thing is this sugar pop
two-faced I shadow quad or not quad but
kit it looks like this and it's got all
these colors mmm and it's so nice and
everything is like super super pigmented
like I don't know if you can even see
that it's really nice i like using the
top one the brown and the middle one the
plumper in the crease and then i blend
it out and this these two colors here
are so nice for all over the lid I've
yet to um you know play around with the
colors like the actual colors because
that kind of makes me nervous but let me
know in the comments if you guys like
using colors on your eyes your eyelids
and if you like it or not because I feel
like that makes me very nervous but
yeah I'll see then the next thing I've
been using a ton of is the too faced
chocolate soleil bronzer now everyone
talks about this on youtube and I never
actually tried it because I really liked
the hula by benefit bronzer but this one
for one it smells like chocolate like
what this actually smells like chocolate
like I kinda want to eat this and
whatever what happened if I ate it no
Alex don't do that it's matt so it's
really good for contouring and because I
have been getting some color with my oh
my god because I'm in getting some color
with my spray tan and stuff like that
I'm being in LA this has actually worked
really nice to my skin tone they sent me
a few other bronzers but this one for
now has been my absolute favorite so let
me know in the comments if you guys do
like this bronzer and um what you guys
think about it because it's all very new
to me but I just am loving the smell
that is like crazy oh by the way they're
not sponsoring this video like I truly
just like this and then they also send
me to other products which are the new
lip glosses lipsticks I don't know cuz I
really don't know much about to face i
just recently started purchasing their
items and I've loved every single thing
that I bought so far especially the
better than sex mascara that is my
absolute I think my absolute favorite
product ever buy them that I'm wearing
it right now I don't know if you guys
can tell they're like the melted lip
glosses lipsticks I have two different
colors like this you can see them for
yourselves I've used them both before
and in previous videos and a bunch of
you asked questions about them so it was
these ones this one is called melted
peony and this one is melted melon so I
just really like them this was more
Coralie this one's more pink you can mix
them together if you guys liked but
these are perfect colors for me
especially for the springtime loving it
so that is all for beauty favorites now
on to random favourites guys this is
what i mean by random do you know this
is can you guys even see this like this
thing
is the most amazing thing in the entire
world if you guys don't know what this
is you're probably thinking Alex what
the hell is that when you're stressed
out when you're just having a bad time
your scalp is itchy or it's just like
you're just not in a good mood take this
get somebody to do it on you or you can
do it yourself and it's the best thing
you just like oh my god I'm just gonna
film the rest of my video like this what
do you guys think about that should I
just you know fill my video like hey
guys what's up my name's Alex like when
you had outfit of the day but for real
this thing is literally the best thing
in the entire world I just bought this
at chapters because I was in line buying
a book and I saw this and I remember my
friend Laura had this and I was like oh
my god it's meant to be basically you
need to get one of these things in your
life because they solve all my problems
and then the last round of favorite is
this food item this is called real fruit
gummies um it's probably not real proof
at all it's better than actual candy but
I've just been obsessed with these ever
since I went to Florida last month I
bought them for the plane ride and now i
always crave them which is really bad
but they're so good i really like the
cherry flavor the strawberry flavor
flavor the raspberry and the greek so
all the red ones because i only read
candy and then I leave all the yellow
and orange my boyfriend cuz he likes
that so it works out great but this is
really really good onto my human
favorite of a month it's probably my
cousin Christina because if you guys
