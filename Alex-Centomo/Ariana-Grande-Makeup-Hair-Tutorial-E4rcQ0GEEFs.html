with my boyfriend's little sister Trish
and today we did the ariana grande
makeup tutorial and hair tutorial so if
you could see from the side we did her
classic ponytail and the little bow that
she usually wears and then the makeup
tutorial that she normally wears when
she goes out to events so if you're
interested in seeing how i did this look
then just keep on watching i'm starting
off with my michael todd lotion to
moisturize tricia space in preparation
for the makeup
you
I then we'll be applying my Smashbox
photo finish light primer all over her
face to set it and to get ready for the
makeup so that way it stays on all nice
and smooth and then taking her Garnier
skin renew BB cream I'm going to be
applying this all over her face by
putting little dots everywhere then
blending it out with a makeup brush
you
you
you
then taking any concealer I'm just using
my Maybelline cover stick concealer
going to be applying this on her face
under her eyes and on to any blemish to
get rid of any redness or blotchiness
anywhere and Ariana has a very clear
complexion so I just thought this would
look great and then taking my makeup
forever setting powder I'm going to be
applying this all over Trish's face to
make it Matt and let the makeup set then
taking my hoola bronzer by benefit this
is the actual bronzer that Ariana
usually wears I'm going to be applying
this to Trish's cheekbones she's making
such funny faces she's so cute just with
an angled brush to contour her face then
using a very sheer pinkish kind of peach
color on to the apples of her cheeks and
blending it out onto her temples then
taking my NARS I primer I'm going to be
applying this to her eyelids to get it
ready for the eyeshadows if ariana is
wearing eyeshadow because she doesn't
wear eyeshadow all the time she normally
wears some kind of golden brown color
sometimes it's shimmery sometimes it's
matt so for today I'm taking patina by
Mac and applying at all over Trish's lid
and then I'm taking some of the color
would wink by Mac and applying it to the
outer corner and then blending it out
with a nude color underneath the brow
bone and into the inner corner and then
I'm taking kind of a taupe color and
just pushing into the lower lash line
then I will be applying some eyeshadow
on to Trish's browse to thicken them up
a little bit to make them fit more
ariana grande style because she does
have very thick and full eyebrows
and then on to curling Trish's eyelashes
and getting them ready for the false
eyelashes because ariana grande loves to
have thick and full eyelashes all the
time so she'll either where individual
lashes or full lashes just like this and
then taking my duo lash glue I'm going
to be applying it on to her lid this
glue is great because it comes off white
so you can see you know where you're
applying it but it normally dries
completely clear
and then for any spot that didn't dry
completely clear I'm going to be
applying some liquid eyeliner just to
cover up any glue
and then just applying any kind of
mascara that you wish to the lower
lashes and then apply it to the top to
blend your lashes with the false lashes
together iono usually wears a nudie pink
lip so I'm just taking this nude color
and I'm going to be applying it all over
Trish's lips and then I'm going to be
applying a pink lipstick over top of
that
so for the hair I'm going to be applying
this heat protectant spray bite resume
all over the hair just to get it ready
for any heat that you're going to be
putting onto the hair then brushing it
out and putting it into a high ponytail
but not completely on top of her head
just near the top crown part of the head
once that is done i will be taking a
small piece of hair from underneath and
just wrapping it around and then putting
it together because arianna usually has
her ponytail like this
and then curling some pieces of the
ponytail all in one direction so that
they can all be kind of one big curl
just the way Ariana has it
and then spraying any loose hairs into
place and making it all nice and sleek
and then of course you cannot finish
this look without the classic ariana
grande bow and there you have it okay
