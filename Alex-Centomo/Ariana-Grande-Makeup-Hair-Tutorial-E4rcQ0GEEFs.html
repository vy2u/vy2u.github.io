with my boyfriend's little sister Trish
and today we did the Ariana Grande
makeup tutorial and a hair tutorial so
if you could see from the side we did
her classic ponytail and the little bow
that she usually wears and then the
makeup tutorial that she normally wears
when she goes out to events so if you're
interested in seeing how I did this look
then just keep on watching I'm starting
off with my Michael Todd lotion to
moisturize Trish's face in preparation
for the makeup
you
I then will be applying my Smashbox
photo-finish light primer all over her
face to set it and to get ready for the
makeup so that way it stays on all nice
and smooth and then taking her Garnier
skin renew BB cream I'm going to be
applying this all over her face by
putting little dots everywhere then
blending it out with a makeup brush
you
you
then taking any concealer I'm just using
my Maybelline cover stick concealer
going to be applying this on her face
under her eyes and on to any blemish to
get rid of any redness or blotchiness
anywhere and Ariana has a very clear
complexion so I just thought this would
look great and then taking my makeup
forever setting powder I'm going to be
applying this all over Trish's face to
make it matte and let the makeup set
then taking my hoola bronzer by benefit
this is the actual bronzer that Arianna
usually wears I'm going to be applying
this to Trish's cheekbones she's making
such funny faces she's so cute just with
an angled brush to contour her face then
using a very sheer pinkish kind of peach
color on to the apples of her cheeks and
blending it out onto her temples then
taking my NARS eye primer I'm going to
be applying this to her eyelids to get
it ready for the eyeshadows if Ariana is
wearing eye shadow because she doesn't
wear eyeshadow all the time she normally
wears some kind of golden brown color
sometimes it's shimmery sometimes it's
matte so for today I'm taking patina by
Mac and applying that all over Trish's
lid and then I'm taking some of the
color wood wink by Mac and applying it
to the outer corner and then blending it
out with a nude color underneath the
brow bone and into the inner corner and
then I'm taking kind of a taupe color
and just pushing into the lower lash
line
then I will be applying some eyeshadow
onto Trish's brows to thicken them up a
little bit to make them a bit more
ariana grande style because she does
have very thick and full eyebrows
and then on to curling Trish's eyelashes
and getting them ready for the false
eyelashes because ariana grande loves to
have thick and full eyelashes all the
time so she'll either wear individual
lashes or full lashes just like this and
then taking my duo lash glue I'm going
to be applying it onto her lid this glue
is great because it comes off white so
you can see you know where you're
applying it but it normally dries
completely clear
and then for any spot that didn't dry
completely clear I'm going to be
applying some liquid eyeliner just to
cover up any glue
and then just applying any kind of
mascara that you wish to the lower
lashes and then apply it to the top to
blend your lashes with the false lashes
together
Ayana usually wears a nudey pink lip so
I'm just taking this nude color and I'm
going to be applying it all over Trish's
lips and then I'm going to be applying a
pink lipstick over top of that
so for the hair I'm going to be applying
this heat protectant spray white resin a
all over the hair just to get it ready
for any heat that you're going to be
putting onto the hair then brushing it
out and putting it into a high ponytail
but not completely on top of her head
just near the top crown part of the head
once that is done I will be taking a
small piece
from underneath and just wrapping it
around and then putting it together
because Arianna usually has her ponytail
like this
and then curling some pieces of the
ponytail all in one direction so that
they can all be kind of one big curl
just the way Ariana has it
and then spraying any loose hairs into
place and making it all nice and sleek
and then of course you cannot finish
this look without the classic ariana
grande bow and there you have it okay
