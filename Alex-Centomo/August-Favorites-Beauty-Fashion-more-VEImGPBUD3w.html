channel by the way I promised you I'm
not naked I'm wearing a shirt my hair is
just covering it that being said let's
get on to the rest of the video so I've
been trying out a lot of different
things in the month of August I can't
believe August has come to an end I
literally say that in every video I need
to stop but it just it baffles my mind
how quickly time goes now like what
kambili summer's over uh but basically
I've been trying out a lot of different
products buying a lot of different
clothes and getting into a lot of
different trends and stuff that i
thought i would like to share with you
guys of course like i do in all my
monthly favorites but the first thing i
actually want to talk to you about was
an app that i recently discovered well
kind of like maybe at the beginning of
the summer the app is called kira and
that's with three use i know it's kind
of confusing but it's an awesome app so
the first thing i would kind of say
about the app is it's very similar to
instagram like the layout of it so you
know how instagram you have like your
news feed or whatever where the people
you follow you have your explore page
you have your page where you could
upload pictures and then you have like
your profile and all that kind of stuff
sokurah has all the same things but the
difference with this app and reason why
I love it so much is that it's a super
interactive app like you guys know I
love to be interactive with you guys and
I love to get your feedback and your
ideas and your I guess thoughts and
opinions on a lot of things so that is
where this app comes into like a huge
importance in my life because I'm going
to be working on this app for a kind of
long term I think I'm going to really
look get into it i'm working on like
developing it with the creators and
stuff it's not my appt at all but i just
really want to get involved with it
because i think it's such an awesome
idea basically like the main thing i
like about it is that for one it's a
digital closet it's an online closet
where you can upload basically
everything you have on to kira and have
everything shown what you have in your
closet but not just fashion wise it
could be anything it can be hair makeup
whatever you like and then the other
thing that I really like about the app
is that you can have poles you can
create polls unlike certain whatever
aspects you have so what I really really
really like about the app is that
there's two features that are really
so the first option is called this with
that so basically you can upload two
pictures that are kind of together and
you can ask like does this go with that
so there's a lot of times around
especially shopping and I need something
like an outfit or something for an event
or just I have like a girls night or
something that I want to go to and I
don't know what goes or even like this
this lipstick go with this dress even
when I'm at home all the times I'll be
texting my friends but I feel like this
would be so cool to get you guys
involved as well like if I need to have
an outfit ready or something I can
literally post and be like do these
jeans go with this top or do these shoes
go with this like what goes with and
then you guys can vote on it and I can
actually wear that item out and like how
could I be if I vlog that and just I
feel like that's like such a cool thing
and even you guys you can sign up as
well and you can start doing that with
your friends when you have sleepovers
and you have like a dance or a party and
there's gonna be boys there and you want
to kind of just show off and you don't
know what to wear instead of having to
like text all your friends individually
you can literally upload it on the app
you can put like a time frame of when
you want the like picture to be up so
like when the pole is over let's say you
have an event in three days and you want
to get like I guess your friends to kind
of boat which one you want with the
other you can have it up for three days
and then like it ends after that and
they'll tell you which one won and then
you can wear that outfit and you can
also get creative and ask like about
different designer outfits you can ask
something that has a yes or no answer so
it's like do you like this free people
dress or do you like this Windsor dress
and then people can answer yes or no so
when you're in a fitting room at a store
and you want to buy something but you're
not too sure and you're alone you don't
have anyone there for like advice and
you don't want to listen to the sales
associate cuz you're kind of like you're
just trying to sell me this item you
want like general like real feedback you
can post it there and you can get an
honest answer and then not waste one
hundred dollars because that literally
happens to me all the time so then the
second feature which is really cool is
called this or that so this one's really
cool i feel like i would use it more
like for the fashion side of things and
i would post like let's say two
different dresses and I could say this
or that like which you know which outfit
I should wear and then my friends you
guys can like pick which outfit I should
wear so I feel like that would be really
fun for events you can ask like any
questions you can ask like Zac Efron or
Channing Tatum which one you know you
can make it fun you can make it like
really cool and interesting and it's
just it find its like so fun or even
things like should I wear my hair
straight tonight or up in a bun what
should I do I can just I feel like I can
get so much feedback from you guys and
just really get interactive and just
have you guys be a part of my life and
what's really exciting is that next week
I'm going to New York City for Fashion
Week I was so excited I just posted
about it on Instagram while I gave you
guys a hint with like the Apple because
it's Big Apple get it but basically um
I'm gonna be there and I thought it
would be such a cool idea if you guys
like got the app obviously and then
followed me and help me pick my outfits
for Fashion Week like how insane would
that be I feel like it would be so cool
because then you can actually see me
post on Instagram like the outfit that
you guys voted for you can help me
decide what to wear and if you think
like okay I don't really like that or i
don't really like that but i think this
would look better like I feel like that
would be so amazing so I'm really
excited about this app I feel like it's
also great for back to school like what
should I wear today at school up my
camera battery just died rude oh my
goodness my hair is just going all over
the place I forgot to mention one other
thing too you can actually set your
profile and your wardrobe to private if
you don't want people to see what you're
posting so the creators of the app are
actually working on a few new features
that will be coming out very soon so the
first one would be videos you guys will
be able to post videos soon which
obviously I may be posting videos
because you guys know I'm obsessed with
making videos and the other thing is
you'll be able to start purchasing
things and selling things on the app
which would be really cool because then
you can like actually upload stuff and
you guys know me I have an overwhelming
amount of stuff that I would like to
sell so who knows maybe I'll start doing
that on the app and the other thing
would be instant messaging so you guys
can you know talk to each other like a
text message but it's just on the app
itself maybe we can text I'll be really
fun so if you guys are interested please
check out the link down below don't
forget to follow me on the app of course
I'll have my user name and everything
down there and check out my wardrobe
obviously get ready for Fashion Week is
that's gonna be so much fun I may be
posting on there all the time so I'm
really excited about it okay that being
said I'm gonna go into my other
favorites I don't have too many but I
have been getting a ton of questions and
what I've been wearing on my lips lately
so I'm wearing it today
a bit strange right now because it is
completely pouring rain thundering
outside right now and I don't know the
lighting is just you know but um i
actually have been wearing it's a lip
combination i showed it on my blogging
channel but i haven't actually talked
about it here so it's by charlotte
tilbury i actually saw this lip tutorial
in a video and literally bought the
products like this is ever happen to you
guys where you watch a video and then
you buy everything they show because
that's happens to me a lot so there are
two lip liners and two lipsticks kind of
crazy but that is what i use today i
only used one lips one lip liner and one
lipstick but normally i'll use all four
and it looks amazing i was just kind of
lazy so there two lips lip liners are
like a nude in a more pinky nude so the
nude nude one is called iconic nude
which is the more brownie nude color i
call it like the kylie jenner lip color
and then the more pinky nude is called
pillow talk and i really like these two
together i use pillow talk all over my
lips and then i outlined with the more
brownish one to give it really detailed
more full balumptuous' look and then
there are two lipsticks and the first
one is called nude kate and this was
actually created for kate moss so I love
it it's such a beautiful color and then
the last one is called canopy pink and
it's just more of a pinky nude again
that has been my lip combination I got a
ton of questions in my last video and
what I was wearing my intro / a TRO
that's what I was wearing so the next
kind of like beauty skincare item I've
been loving is this valley body oil so
this is a tanning oil but it's all
natural and nothing harmful in it but I
actually don't use it as a tanning oil
because I don't really believe in like
sitting in the Sun with timing oil all
of your body i don't really like that
because it's just harmful in my personal
opinion but I've actually been using
this on my skin is like a moisturizer at
night and it works wonders it doesn't
break me out it's very moisturizing I
actually got the idea from my friend
Bear and i've been using it and i love
it so that is what I've been doing and
then for fashion I have two favorites a
one being kind of the same thing so I've
been upset some baseball caps I love
that trend I think it's so sporty and
chic and awesome so I've been loving
these two baseball caps they're both
navy blue because
have an obsession with navy blue the
first one is from brandy melville says
California on it and it's more like I
don't know like shorter I don't know
it's not as like baseball cap it's just
more chic and like you this one is a
legit baseball cap so this one as you
can see is very like curved it's a
Yankees cap i got it from ASOS and i
love it and then my last fashion
favorite are these Nike shoes holy crap
guys look how nice these are every time
I wear them i get so many compliments so
i forget what they're called but i'll
leave them in a description below
obviously they're just like the classic
all white nike sneakers and they have a
bit of like the platform i actually
bought them because Amanda's steel was
wearing them a lot so that is literally
why i got them to make up my mind even
though she's like so much younger I
thought they looked so awesome on her so
that is why and they're all white so
amazing and then my last favorite of the
month is a person and her name is bear I
was talking about her before she
introduced me to bally body love her she
has an amazing photography account on
Instagram she takes pictures of herself
but she also does a lot of photography
it's very tumblr if you like that like
tumblr looking feed definitely check her
out she's awesome I can't wait to start
working together with her more she's
like the sweetest girl ever and she's a
total babe like love her to death she's
so pretty and yeah I'll leave her link

check her out as well as all the links

including the app please check it out

really hard on and I just love it so
much I love the company I love

for Fashion Week I'm just excited for so
many things and i feel like im so hyper
right now and you're probably getting
really freaked out by like me just
