to apologize if you can hear any
construction noises going on they are
doing construction outside of my house
and there's nothing I can really do
about it so I apologize in advance if
you hear anything like that so getting
right into the video um a monthly
favorites video is very impressed it by
you guys and I haven't done one since
June I think and I just really like
monthly favorites the only problem is
that i don't buy a lot of stuff every
single month like when I find favorites
I usually stick to those favorites for
like a long time so it's not like I'm
finding new favorites everyone so when I
do find like enough products to show in
a video i will do a favorites if you
guys like these kinds of videos and yeah
let's just get right into it so I guess
I'll start off with my necklaces because
you guys always ask me and my pictures
on Instagram and in my videos where I
get my necklaces from and I always link
it down below in the description as well
as in the pictures if you guys tap my
photos you will see where everything is
from but these choker necklaces are from
nomadic store and I am just obsessed
with chokers especially the ones from a
nomadic store I just really like them a
lot my favorites this month have been
this moon choker which I'm obsessed with
anything that has to do like the solar
system in the universe and all that kind
of stuff I just really like it a lot so
this moon choker is super nice that I
have this dainty little chain choker and
I like to wear this one a little bit
lower just because I really like the
feel of it and then I also have these
ones and there's this chain one which I
wore a ton in the month of
August as well I just really like it I
think it's so cool it's if it's like the
same as this one so you can wear them
like low like this or you can wear them
higher I just prefer to wear them a
little bit lower so this one's super
cool it's just a chain also a lot of you
guys ask where i get these ribbon hair
ties from this one is from pura vida but
i used to buy them at Urban Outfitters
so you can honestly get them wherever I
just think there's so much better than
regular hair hair bands or he retires
whatever you guys call them because they
don't leave creases in your hair and
they're just really cute when they're in
your hair sometimes they come with
little bows and stuff but I just think
it's really cute so before I get into
any like products or clothing i actually
just want to mention something to you
guys so there's a website called Opinion
Outpost so it's basically just a website
where research companies want to hear
your opinion about like food television
movies different products politics like
all that kind of stuff and it's free to
join and what's really cool about it is
that you can make money by doing it you
can earn like cash you can earn amazon
gift cards iTunes gift cards and it's
all by just like sharing your opinion
which is super cool I started trying
this out in august i actually heard
about it from lauren love lauren
elizabeth and i decided to hop on the
bandwagon because i just do that plus
they have a ten-thousand-dollar
quarterly prize just for sharing your
opinions and beat for being an active
member and like who doesn't want $10,000
like Hello your chest what would you do
a ten-thousand-dollar seriously like
would you spend on clothing would you
spend it on would you even spend it
would you save it on my go ahead
getting stressed out right now but
seriously if I have like an extra ten
thousand dollars I feel like I would
save it I would probably save it no I
don't know I couldn't I couldn't say
until I had the money so each time you
participate you actually get entered in
that draw and it's free to join all you
have to do is check your promotions tab
on your gmail account to see the emails
from Opinion Outpost super quick and
easy it's so much fun if you're like
bored or whatever after school on the
weekends you have like no plans because
literally my life but um you just kind
of like oh look here's a survey on pizza
why not just do it because I love pizza
and look I'm entered into winning ten
thousand dollars plus gift cards I just
think it's really cool I tried it out in
the month of August and I just became
addicted it doesn't take much time it's
really fun um I just like that kind of
stuff that's just my personality when i
get bored I like too late do surveys I
know at school all the times I used to
love getting those surveys about the
teachers or about anything in general I
just love like clicking out my opinion
on stuff so it's really cool i will link
a link in the description box below
where you can click to join if you guys
are interested and let me know about
down below if you like that kind of
stuff but basically all I'm saying is
it's a really cool idea I just thought
it was really sweet so thank you lauren
for introducing that to me she has no
idea of who i am but i really like her
and I thought it was really interesting
and really fun and who does not want to
win free stuff right i mean you guys
know that i would my get movies but like
I would love to ruin free step as well
okay with that being said let's get into
I guess products the josie maran pure
argan oil and this stuff is honestly
awesome I got the lite version just
because I have light hair I don't know
why I i used to use the light moroccan
oil so i just figured i'd buy the lite
version of this but i didn't actually
know that this is could be used for like
your skin so you can use this on dry
patches your hands your elbows I can use
this on my face
it's pretty awesome i haven't tried it
on my face yet just because I've been
too nervous because I've had like really
bad breakouts a month of August but I
thought it was really cool and it works
wonders on my dead ends so I just really
like this a lot the next thing you guys
all know I have shown this in so many
tutorials but it is the bumble and
bumble texturising cream this stuff is
my like new holy grail product not only
does it smell amazing I just find it
smells like the ocean it's so flattering
on your hair I just really like that
like grungy kind of messy look to my
hair I'm not wearing it today I should
have probably worn it for this video but
I kind of just rolled out of bed I did
my makeup but this stuff is super
awesome if you like that kind of like
really textured kind of messy boho look
I usually put this in my hair after I
finished styling it so if I'm you know
curling it for that day or whatever or
if I'm just leaving it natural like
today my hair is pretty natural so I
would just kind of like rub this in my
hair and I'd be good to go now the next
item I have is the rocket or blush by a
benefit this is pretty old but I have
just been wearing this so much in the
month of August you guys can see it's
like a corally pink color it's super
nice I'm wearing it today I don't know
if you guys can see like what it looks
like but I'm not wearing any highlight
this is literally just the blush and
then the last thing I have is this
little sample lipstick a half from make
up forever I got it in one of those gift
bag things
super beautiful color as you could see
I'm actually wearing it on my lips today
which go to my head I'm wearing on my
lips today and I've been wearing this
all the time almost every single video
and a lot of you guys asked me what it's
called and it's just called the Rouge
artists natural so whatever that is but
I just really like this color it's like
kind of a nude pink reddish color I'm
not too sure but I just really like it a
lot now on to clothing so you guys know
the of course I love brandy melville but
in particular this top by bratty is my
new favorite thing ever so it's just a
plain black oversized t-shirt what
struck me the most about this shirt is
this pocket I just think it's so cool
it's just like I don't know it gives
something a little different to the
plain black shirt and I just love shirts
like this I live in them now on to my
this is actually my number one favorite
thing that I'm showing you guys in this
video today and you know everyone has
their opinion on these pants but
personally I think they're freaking
awesome I'm so in love and so obsessed
with them and they are these jeans by a
1 teaspoon you guys know I love 1 2 1
teaspoon I show them multiple times in
my videos and I always wear them in my
Instagram pictures because I just love
one teaspoon the quality is amazing I've
said so many times yes they're expensive
but you're paying for quality and I've
had a pair of shorts from them for four
years and they are like brand new
supersoft doesn't get crunchy when you
wash them I just love it so these are
like the hem as you can see they seem
really big because they're supposed to
be worn super low and baggy with a belt
so you know the boyfriend jeans these
are like extreme boyfriend jeans they're
so badly so they have like a big drop
crotch like this as you could see like
these go low on your waist and then the
drop Koch's like down there so like they
go super low the back looks like this
the pockets are really big again super
baggy so like your butt would be here
and then the drop crotch goes all the
way down but what's awesome about these
is they have slit in the knee on both
sides like a really big slit
they go tight on the ankles with this
legs different detailing so they go
super tight if you wanted you I'm 58 I
have really long lady they go all the
way down to my ankles but if you wanted
to and I saw online the girl on the
website was wearing them like more up on
her calves like kind of bunched up but I
like the fact that they're tighter on
the bottom and then super baggy and
loose on the top I will insert a picture
of my sister wearing them because they
she made them look so awesome with what
she was wearing and I just think they
are so cute and every time I wear them I
get complimented on them although when I
first took them out of the packaging
everyone in my household was like what
is that like are those Daniels jeans
like what what are you gangster like
they're all like making fun of it I put
them on with the right outfit i styled
my sister everyone's like oh I see what
you mean I'm look see you don't know
anything you don't know any so the last
item I have to show you is this sweater
from free people and I actually show
this in my boho look book that has these
big pockets it goes pretty low and I
just like it's like open it I saw a
picture of candice swanepoel wearing
this with boyfriend jeans and like a
crop top that went up I super cute and
it's like really soft and thick and on
those like cool nights I loved throwing
this on over anything I was wearing it's
super comfortable i love it so much plus
you guys know I love free peoples and
I'm so excited to rock this more in the
winter and the fall I love layering now
on to some random favourites I know a
lot of youtubers do a human favor of the
month my photos are really cool idea

something and I just think it's awesome
