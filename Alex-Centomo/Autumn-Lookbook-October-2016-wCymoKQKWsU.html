Heil
I just recently realized that all my tan
lines are gone and I know it's not that
big of a deal but it just makes me sad
it makes me feel like I need to self tan
cuz I love being Ted but it's ok because
fall is my favorite season and I love it
so much so it's all good anyways welcome
back to my channel or if you're new
welcome I decided to film this video
because for one when I moved out I
realized that the nature is just so
beautiful here in Montreal it's stunning
I love it especially during the autumn
leaves changing like looking out my
window right now it looks like a picture
and also I really want to show you guys
how I dress in the fall time so some of
these outfits
since the weather goes like this in
Montreal I swear some days are like
practically summer some days are
freezing I wanted to show a different
kind of range about fits that I could
wear for those specific days when either
it's warmer or colder and so I thought
it would be a really good opportunity to
do that and give you an insight to my
style again but of course these are just
for inspiration you don't have to buy
the exact pieces at all I will still
have links down below for you guys if
you're curious to see where I did get
the products but were the items also
before I get into the video I just
wanted to quickly say that my really
good friend some started a YouTube
channel this is not a club I just really
want to give him a shout out because
he's so talented
if you guys don't follow him on
Instagram well for one you should his
name is Samuel Elkins and he is an
amazing photographer his pictures are
just perfect like I just every time I
see a picture I just wonder how he does
it like I just can't and I really want
to work with him he recently started a
channel and he put out his first video
which is kind of like almost like a
diary of just his shoots that he does
with models and places that he travels
to when he's shooting and it's just so
aesthetically pleasing and really good
I'll have it over the screen right here
but I really think you guys should check
it out so either click the screen right
now so it'll bring you but if you're on
your phone you can definitely check out
the links below go subscribe tell them
that I sent you and that you really
liked his work or a comment something
really nice and
and let him know that he's awesome he
also put out a Q&amp;amp;A so if you guys are
curious to know anything about
videography photography anything like
that check it out because it's actually
really helpful and kind of taught me a
lot of stuff too I'm not a photographer
so I don't know anything but he's really
good so yeah without further ado let's
just get into the video because I feel
like I'm just like my intros are just
always so long
just looking in your heart I see
your body kids around
I am the friend
kid sweetness
