and then you with your shirt open maybe
wearing a boy shirt oh my legs they
really burn yeah kyla shaved your legs
and now she has a really major did you
not do so we're not wearing pants oh
yeah hi guys I'm here with my sister i
hi I'm not wearing any makeup because I
just didn't feel like it to be honest
and Kyla it's all done up and it just
such a great time so if you guys didn't
know there's a movie coming out called
sisters with Tina Fey and Amy Poehler
and I love both of them so much I saw
the trailer and I actually got inspired
to like do a sister video we get so many
questions new videos together if you
guys don't know she has a channel as
well I like it down below yeah alright
eyeliner for the first time and I'm like
I'm not wearing any makeup um so yeah we
get a lot of questions to do videos
together we did like a Styles a sister
style stop once and just like I'm no Q
nays but I had an idea to kind of just
sit down with her and talk about like
old funny stories that we had as
children growing out of those yeah like
we are very weird kids like very weird
kids and you know growing up we went
through like like being really close and
as teenagers like hating each other and
then now as adults we like get along a
lot better and I think that it's just
like when I hated each other we just
thought yeah I mean typical siblings
right I mean is there any siblings out
there that don't fight ever like I think
that's impossible
um so as children for one I'm older so
I'm trying to half years older than her
she just turned 23 and I turned 25 in
the summer and as children um I was an
only child for two and half years which
is like the best time of my life and
then she came along and my mom Tori
Windex my mouth and got away we got away
from stories my mom told me that when
she was born I actually went up to my
mom and I was like mommy can you put her
back in your tummy please like I just do
not like it well cuz I didn't get any of
the attention any more like I did but it
wasn't I was the cute kid you really
like the Shirley Temple ringlets hair
kid she's so cute though I know what
makes no sense
as children Kyla as a person is very
she's very independent and she like
never really needed anyone to play with
I mean not that I did as well but like I
had no friends no you did but like you
like to talk about yourself a lot too
I'm like you were able to get lost in
your imagination whereas like I always
like liked having friends I had an
imaginary friend burbot that was the
creepiest thing ever we'll get into that
out yeah I mean I can get into it now I
had an imaginary friend till I was like
four her name was sissy she was 12 I
believe she was a ghost because like she
was so detailed in my imagination in my
dad said I would have conversations with
her for like ever
creepy I know but because Kyle I never
want to play with me so I was very
jealous of her and there was one time I
pushed her down the stairs one time I
sprayed Windex in her mouth saying it
was candy and basically almost killed
her but I mean I was like five I didn't
understand but like Kyla also growing up
with a strange child and she had
something called penis envy so this is
actually a thing let you learn it when
you take psychology was a Freud yeah
okay so it's a thing that children
sometimes get especially girls they get
this thing called penis envy where they
see their father is like the one that's
in charge in the family the one that's
like the decision-maker and like and
you're envious of that you want yeah but
like you don't but like she literally
wanted a penis like she used to put a
toy snake in her underwear and pretend
it was a penis and there's multiple
videos but we're like I'm dancing and
being all cute and then my dad goes to
my sister and she just like she's like I
have a penis
she had a raspy voice as a kid so it's
like I have a penis
and she had always like chapped lips
like the red like this big red mark
she'd always like this do like oh my god
I need to find that sometimes I find all
these clips I don't think I'll be able
to but like I think one day I'm gonna
get that because it's on an old video
cassette tape things so I'm gonna get
them transferred onto like my computers
and thing one day we'll do it the
reacting - yeah I know
and then also I was really awkward as a
child like I had like big glasses and
buck teeth and like I always thought you
were new yeah but it was like a cute
dork ya know whereas like I was on
cute except I was weird there's one time
I was a three year old bodybuilder yeah
she was so muscular but you were not
three in this video you were maybe like
five we were outside in our old house in
the backyard I was playing in the
sprinkler with my clothes on obviously
and Kyla comes outside for dance filming
she just pulls down her pen and starts
peeing on the back patio like a boy
standing up with my hips out we push to
the front and I'm just peeing my dad's
like hey what are you doing why didn't
you keep you on the patio and then she's
just like she looks at images him
sticking her tongue out okay so as
children oh yeah another thing is we
were always naked we're gonna get a lot
of the times so we were always naked as
children like literally loved to run
around naked probably tell us like eight
or nine or like 14 I don't know just
you're very strange children and then as
adolescence I guess we had this habit
but started all because I was obsessed
with Abercrombie and I would buy all my
clothes remebered by me and then Kyla
would go into my room and steal all my
clothes and because I was in first of
all they didn't fit her because I was a
lot bigger than her at this time because
she was still like a little child like
that awkward stage where like she
already hit puberty and she was getting
boobs and like curves and everything but
I was still like the true fly and like I
was always like really like skinny oh
stick so like everything that you would
get like you would get those shirts that
were tight here and then they'd flare oh
I like where it was supposed to be tight
like around your boobs like it would be
tight on my sister but it wouldn't be
tightly she would just be like baggy
them like hey extra bag but yeah I
remember because I was in a sports
program and I would like leave school
early to go to my swimming competition
whatever training and then she would I
would see her at school and then as soon
as I left she would go into the bathroom
and change into my clothing that she's
stolen kept in her backpack and I
remember Molly was like I saw your
sister bring your shirt today I'm like
what oh it's so much I was so mad but
then I started stealing from her like
when she got older we got into a
physical fight once in our entire life
I was over a shirt weer it was like not
a nice fight like we were really bad at
it we're not good fighters but yeah we
fought a lot as teenagers like most
people do and then I think as we got
older we started getting a lot more of
the same interests and we just got along
a lot better I mean obviously everyone
still fights like we still have our
arguments we're not like perfect but
like we get along really well I find and
we complement each other well like my
sister's really good at advice she's
really good at you know listening and
like being there and then I think like
you are - yeah but it's different
because I feel like you're more like the
mature one I like it's true like I'm
very like a mature for my age and like
dorky and I think that a lot of times my
sister will I call me out on like my
 Alliance she'll be like Alex
like and she'll just tell me how it is
and I'm like you're right you know like
even though sometimes I don't admit it
to her face cuz I don't want to be wrong
but then like inside of my way of
admitting it to me is when you get extra
mad at me
I think I'm like it's because she knows
I'm right and in the moment I'm always
like no I don't want to get it but like
I like I'm so dead set on being right
but they're like in the back of my mind
I'm like it's cuz I know she's right
when you're stressed out I feel like I
help you a lot - yeah so I don't know
you you do a lot for people like yeah
you know your sibling is the longest
relationship you'll have in your entire
life like longer than your parents
longer than any friendship longer than
your significant other your sibling is
the one that's there from the beginning
till the end like always so I say
siblings are just so important to have I
know I want to have children not to say
that being an only child is a bad thing
because it's definitely not but I just
think that having a sibling is probably
like the best thing I've ever
experienced in my entire life and I
would never ever change that for the
world like I do not wish that I was ever
an only child like maybe when I was you
know 2 and 1/2 and she was born and I
was jealous but like there's no one at
the end of the day you know like I can
call her up wherever I am in the world
with any time in the world and she'll be
there for me no matter what
yeah it's true and your blood you know
yeah like you just you just know because
we were raised the same we were in the
same household you have the inside jokes
that like no one else knows
yeah like how we laugh at the dumbest
thing my friends and I'm like oh like
I'm laughing at some parts of like a
movie and they like don't find it funny
you know like only Kyla would find this
funny you know me oh it's deaf have like
the same personnel yeah yeah our deaf
also grew up with us yeah you know so I
feel like you know and I don't know I
think watching that trailer I was like
so excited a movie because it just
really reminded me of like how we're so
different and growing up we were so
different
yeah I feel like but no we met each
other really well and you know at the
end of the day you love each other
and you're their family and it's just
well almost relationship you'll ever
have in your entire life think about
that guys it's pretty with if you're
funny when they're sipping right now I
suggest achill apologize be the bigger
person so I hope you guys aren't you
