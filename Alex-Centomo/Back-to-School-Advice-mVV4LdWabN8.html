twitter and instagram if you could leave
me some questions for a back to school
kind of like advice video this video has
been requested so much lately and
although i graduated high school already
i figured it would be really good for me
to give you guys some advice because
I've been through it all trust me so a
lot of you guys are actually wondering a
lot about self-confidence and like how
to not be shy how to be more outgoing
how to make new friends all that kind of
stuff and that for me was a huge
challenge in high school um a little bit
of background before I get into this um
I went into puberty very late in high
school and the way that my high school
works I don't know if it's like this
everywhere in Canada but where i live in
canada it's like you you're in high
school starting from grade 7 to grade 11
that's high school there's no junior
high or anything like that so once
you're done elementary school or primary
school whatever you guys call it grade 7
you're in high school with all the grade
11 earns and we don't have grade 12
where I'm from we just go straight to
something called say Jeff which is like
a whole big french thing and I'm not
gonna get into that once you are in
grade 7 you're considered to be in high
school and me and grade 7 equaled a
child look like looking like she was 8
years old so yeah I basically look like
that until grade 9 which is like regular
high school for you guys maybe even
grade 10 I went into puberty very late
so as you could all assume I was bullied
very badly in high school because I
looked like I was 8 years old and I did
not fit in at all but the one thing I
want to stress for you guys like so much
is to be yourself like I know it sounds
so cheesy and so weird but seriously
like if you're going to try and change
yourself to fit in with other people or
to you know look cooler it's it's not
good because you're changing who you are
I never was one to want to like change
who I was to fit in I was always very
awkward and very different and very like
just very socially awkward and I'm still
like that today and that's one of the
main things that i love about myself now
I just like that I'm different and it's
so good to be different because later on
in life you're gonna see that this stuff
like in high school really doesn't
matter what other people think on to the
whole like being more outgoing and also
being less shy I was a very shy person
ever since I was little I was always
very shy and that's one of the main
reasons why i started youtube was
because I wanted to be more outgoing and
I was always the one in class that like
even if I knew the answer I didn't want
to raise my hand because I was so shy oh
there's his hair on my word what the
heck yeah I was that kid in school that
even if I did know the answer I was too
shy to raise my hand because I was
scared of like with people would think
of me by like talking or what the TJ
would think or just in case I was wrong
even though I knew it was right like I
was just very very shy and if I could go
back and change anything I would
probably just say to be more outgoing
and to raise your hand in class and
participate as much as you can because
it shows that you're interested it shows
that you want to learn it shows that
you're not scared and the whole purpose
of life is to take risks and to do
things that are outside of your comfort
zone and I definitely was always a very
more reserved person and kind of like
didn't really want to be the one to try
you things or to go outside my comfort
zone but that is like it's taken a toll
on me and I think that for you guys
especially since a lot of you are a lot
younger and are in that situation where
you're you're in high school and you're
at the time where you need to start like
stepping outside of your boundaries I
think it's very important for you guys
to you know be very confident with
yourself and know that everyone is has
been or is in the same boat as you so
people that are older than you have been
where you are so if you were like a
freshman in high school the seniors have
been a freshman before they've been
there so they understand I would say
just to push yourself honestly push
yourself if you know the answer raise
your hand if you want to meet new people
in your class talk to someone don't be
shy like force yourself I know it's not
part of your personality because I'm
definitely i'm a very shy person guys
like I was so shy
I couldn't even like someone would talk
to me and I would shake and like have a
code to tag like it was so bad but I
made sure especially as I got older and
started realizing that it is so
important to push yourself and people
when they meet email they would never
think in a million years that I was shy
and I'm sure there are people from high
school that I went to school is that are
watching this and probably like oh my
gosh like she makes videos and puts them
on the internet for everyone to see like
that's so weird because I was not that
kind of person in high school I was so
scared of my own shadow I was so scared
of everything another question you guys
are wondering is how to stay organized
in school and stay on top of your
schoolwork so I was someone who was very
organized and very on top of my
schoolwork um school is very important
to me I did have a very busy social life
I was a competitive swimmer so I was
training like 10 times a week I had him
like morning practice and afternoon
practice and I still managed to you know
do really well in school because I put
it in my head that it was very important
for me and I wanted to do well I think
for someone that you know social social
life is important to anyone at any time
at any stage in their life to have a
social life is so important but you need
to realize that school is very important
as well it might seem stupid because for
one your teachers can be really bad I've
been there I've had some really crappy
teachers you could be going through a
lot of like bad stuff at home or at
school you can be getting bullied
there's a lot of things that could play
into that but I say just stay on top of
your work so what I used to do is as
soon as I came home from school I would
do my homework right away no matter what
I would not procrastinate because
knowing me putting it to the last minute
I would just stress out and like the job
wouldn't be done properly I'd be
freaking out and all of this worrying
everything was for something that could
have been avoided from the start so even
on Fridays it's like Friday it's the
weekend the last thing you want to do is
do your homework as soon as you get home
from like a long day of school but trust
me it's so worth it because if you get
things done right away you have like the
whole rest of the day you have the whole
rest of the weekend to do something and
not have to worry or stress about your
work so that was one thing that I really
like stuck in my head that I did was
like I did my homework right
and then let's say you get like an essay
or you get certain assignments that
aren't you for the next day but our do
like let's say a few weeks from now or
whatever I would in my agenda write down
everything that was due so I'd write
like what I had for homework and then I
would write on the day that it was due
like when it was due so I would do by
like the thing I want to do the least is
the first thing I would do because
that's the thing that like I did not
want to do it also i force myself to do
it first because then all you have left
are the things that you don't mind doing
as much this is a tip that my dad
actually taught me and I'm really glad
he did because it really made a huge
difference so that's another tip I have
for you guys and then obviously when you
start back at school it's like you
always want to be organized and let you
have all your folders and everything's
color-coordinated and just like you're
so excited to get back into the swing of
things and start new and then it's like
a couple months down the road you're
just like no you're just you're not down
you have to like find it within yourself
to prove to yourself and no one else
that you can do things you can succeed
you can get them done and it's very very
important that you do that because at
the end of the day you go to bed with
yourself and that's all that matters
right guys is you want to make yourself
happy so if it means putting off a few
hours of netflix or going out with your
friends it's definitely important I do
remember there were many times I
couldn't go out with my friends like to
go to the mall which the movies because
I had like a huge assignment due and I
just want to get it over with I did it
and in the long run it benefits you in
so many ways that you don't see it now
in the moment but it does it benefits
you in so many ways so a lot of people
are also asking tips on what to do if
you are not in any classes with any of
your
friends the high school I went to I was
in a special like sports program because
I was an athlete and we were always like
we had one class and our class was
always in this was always together so
every class we did we were the same
group of people so I never had to worry
about stuff like that but I do know if I
were in that situation I would just
approach somebody and start talking to
them whoever you're sitting next to just
talk to them it doesn't matter you know
like i said before you want to get
outside of your comfort zone even if it
is awkward trust me there are so many
times i've been in such awkward
situation so you're just like hi how are
you and then the other person is like
good and you're just kind of like what
do I do now but it doesn't matter
because who cares if you seem awkward if
you're gonna make a friend out of it
than whatever and like honestly being
awkward is so funny like I am the
epitome of awkwardness if you guys
cannot tell I'm so weird so a lot of the
times that's like one of the qualities
that my friends say they like about me
the most is that how like strange i am
and i guess that's a good thing because
being different is so important talk to
someone i'm sure if the person sitting
next to you it's probably in the same
boat if they're not with friends already
they don't know anyone then you guys can
just start up a conversation because you
want to make friends in every classroom
you have you don't wanna just go to
school do your work leave you want to
have a good time too because then it's
just gonna make it more enjoyable and
durable enjoyable you won't have to
worry about stressing about going to a
class because you know you have someone
there so that's probably what I would
say um another thing for like back to
school like your first day back I know a
lot of you guys have started already but
there are some of my viewers that start
next week or in a few weeks and I would
say that on the first day of school I
would probably plan to like meet up with
some people just so you can you know
walk the halls together and you don't
have to be worried about finding someone
or freaking out that you're going to be
alone you know having them meet a meetup
place where you guys can all get
together and walking together is
probably the best or even going with a
friend is good too i know a lot of
people that do that i used to do that
law used to just meet my friends outside
or go in with one friend now on to like
this whole popular thing that
but want me to talk about is like what
do you do if you like a popular boy but
you know he won't like you back or what
do you do if you want to be part of the
popular crowd but they don't accept you
I have to say that in my experience and
a lot of people surrounding me their
experience like the popular kids in high
school are not going to be popular for
the rest of their lives being a part of
the popular crowd is really not the most
important thing in the world I never was
in school and I can say like one hundred
percent that I am so happy for that
because a lot of times like those
popular people are popular for a
negative reason like doing drugs or
something or rebelling because you know
it's all cool to repel at that age um I
would say make sure you stick on top of
your work do not worry about being a
part of the popular crowd because
looking back now all those people that
were popular aren't doing that great
right now so that's all I have to say is
that it's really not the end of the
world stick to your close friends stick
to being yourself if some of your close
friends are changing and trying to be
part of the popular crowd fine let them
let them do it they want you can't
change anything but for yourself try and
stick to that and not try and change who
you are for anything no matter what if
you like a popular boy and you know he
like has a girlfriend who you probably
wouldn't like your bath been there and
you just don't wanna get involved with
that okay so don't even worry about that
high school goes by so quickly you're
gonna see and you're gonna be done I'm
just gonna be like holy crap that was
really it and people say high school is
the best time of their life like it like
I could say it's not I'm having the best
time I like right now and like high
school is like not my thing at the same
time it's a growing experience
everything everyone needs a growing
experience another big rule of mine is
to stay out of drama drama is like the
worst thing you can be a part of
especially at that age holy crap I was
always wanting to kind of just like keep
my own distance and keep my own space
you don't want to start rumors you don't
want to get involved in anyone elses
is someone tells you something don't
repeat it just like stay out of it it's
so important to do that in high school
my personality is very like I don't like
to be surrounded by negativity so you're
your own person you can make your own
decisions you don't have to be
surrounded by that kind of stuff at all
you can just like be like nope no you
need to realize that high school is not
the main part of your life although a
mate it may seem like that at the time
and I certainly felt like when I was in
high school that you know nobody
understood me and I was the only one
going through this no I wasn't you can
talk to someone if you're having
promised talk to your parents if you
feel like you can't talk to your parents
talk to the guidance counselor talk to
your teachers there's always someone
that is willing to help and then it's
there for you and if you really feel
like you have none of that then talk to
me like leave comments message me tweet
me like I'm always here for you guys I
love giving you guys advice I love
seeing your DMS on Instagram and your
messages on Twitter it makes me so happy
stay out of drama keep up with your
schoolwork stay organized be more
outgoing and step out of your comfort
zone it's very very important and also
don't worry about who's popular who's
not popular be yourself and don't change
who you are this all sounds so cheesy
but it's so true and I felt like I did a
pretty good job of doing that in high
school although even though i did get
bullied um i just learned to teach
myself that this is not the end of the
world high school will be over i start
to be more confident with myself and
when people start saying things i was
kind of like okay like you could say
that but like I don't care because I
don't think that about myself so
whatever people bully people say things
because they're upset with themselves so
they're trying to put someone else down
so they can feel better about themselves
just remember that so anyone who makes
fun of you or put you down is because
they're going through something with
themselves and it doesn't have to do
with you at all it's not personal don't
take it personally move on with your
life it's good to be good k guys I swear
life is so amazing high school does not
have to be like the main peak of your
life you don't worry about it it is not
think that's about it if you guys have
any more
