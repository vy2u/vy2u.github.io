today's video because not only is it a
back to school haul which has been so
requested but I also have a little
surprise for you guys at the end I feel
like I said surprise weird surprise for
you guys I made in this video so just
stay tuned for that and let's just get
into it right away because I feel like
my shows are always a million a million
minutes long so back-to-school is really
not the best time ever because it's like
who wants to go back to school I mean
the first day is always really exciting
because you get to see people that you
may have not seen all summer and all
that kind of stuff but then it's like
you're back in school and you're
depressed and you're just like oh what
is my life I can't watch Netflix all day
oh my god what am I gonna do with myself
so naturally going shopping back to
school supply shopping back to school
clothing shopping it's it's pretty it's
pretty fun it kind of tones down the
school a little bit because you get more
excited and then once it starts you're
like oh my god my life so I went
shopping and obviously that's like what
I do I like don't know how to control
myself I went shopping and I figured
that I would show you guys some of my
favorite things to wear one of my school
just because I don't really like to
necessarily dress up completely but I
mean if you've watched my back-to-school
outfit kind of lookbook then I'm sure
you kind of get my style a little bit
somedays I definitely admit that I wear
like my pajamas to school like
sweatpants and a sweatshirt but I mean I
don't have a uniform if you guys have
uniforms then this stuff could be like
perfect for like on your weekends going
out with your friends hanging out doing
whatever you do on weekends so hopefully
this can help some of you guys and
whatever you're doing starting off with
brandy melville because you guys all
love brandy bubbles so much by the way
if the lighting is weird I'm sorry the
Sun is just like going in and out and
this thing that I can't show very well
on camera is a light pink striped long
t-shirt dress and I love brandy Mobile's
t-shirt dresses because not only are
they super soft like all of their
clothing but they're just so versatile
like I can wear this anywhere I
can wear this to bed as like a nightgown
I could wear this out to the beach over
a bikini to the pool over a bikini I
could wear this to school over some
leggings which is what I'm about to tell
you guys right now I can wear it out
with some heels and just up it's just
it's like the best thing ever I'm
obsessed with them they're so
comfortable so loose I mean it's
basically like wearing your pajamas out
but it's okay because they're not me
Java so got away with it what I like to
wear at school are things that are like
comfort comfort is like my number one
thing at school I just need to be
comfortable first things first this
thing super comfortable that's my number
one thing I like to wear this with
chokers because trendy I don't know I
like chokers a lot and I would wear this
with like some leggings if it's a bit
colder where you guys are I'm five eight
for anyone asking so this is kind of
short on me so I do wear like spandex
shorts underneath but if your school has
a dress code where you can't wear
anything that's like if you put your
arms straight down and your fingers go
further then your outfit of what you're
wearing then I would suggest to wear
leggings underneath this because then
it's a little bit inappropriate but I
know add to my school it's totally fine
to wear something like this with shorts
and then if it gets cooler I would throw
on a really oversized like dis dress and
jean jacket I think it's so cool like
mess my hair up a little bit put some
like sea salt spray and some texturizing
spray choker look like I just rolled out
of bed and go to school because that's
literally what I wear so this jean
jacket with some like really cute
booties that's my thing I feel like you
guys all know these tops so well and
I've shown them so many times my videos
but these tops from brandy melville are
literally like the best things ever whoa
I just got really white basically these
are the nadine tops so they're like the
tops that have the little
strike here and a little stripe on the
sleeve they're not necessarily cropped
if you're wearing something really
low-cut then it would show a little bit
of your stomach but if you're wearing
something normal or a little bit
high-waisted then it doesn't show
anything and I really like that about
these tops plus they're super stretchy
and they're super soft and this one is
just like a maroon color and I figured
that since back to school kind of means
fall no I love fall fashion I love fall
colors it's my favorite time of the year
so I'm really excited to wear Maroons
and like greens and stuff because I love
that so I just thought this color would
be really nice for back-to-school wow
this really washes me out on the camera
oh but yeah so this top is just really
cute I just really like it it's super
soft I own like a million of these tops
they're like my favorite things ever the
next kind of thing I like to wear to
school that's comfortable again is like
an oversized t-shirt not a t-shirt dress
that you like completely covers your
butt but something that's like oversized
and baggy but that it's not so obvious
oversized that you drown in it and I
love gray colors this color is awesome I
just I find myself wearing this color
all the time so I thought this would be
perfect for back-to-school it's pretty
long it doesn't cover my full butt but
it covers a lot and I mean for
back-to-school I normally would wear
shorts like jean shorts so it that
doesn't really matter sometimes if I'm
wearing high-waisted shorts I'll do a
little knot so I so I can like have it
higher but I just really like the way
this fits over here the neckline is not
too small like the top it just showed
you it's a bit bigger and the sleeves go
down pretty long which I really like
about that and it's just long and really
comfortable it's a really kind of
different material it's very soft like
almost as if like it's furry and you're
touching it and it's soft that made no
sense as soon as that came out my mouth
looks like out looks what he's saying
next is a sweater of mine that I bought
like me I like to say three weeks ago
two weeks ago and I'll actually identify
it my mom bought it but thank you mommy
for buying this for me because I really
really liked it she saw it and thought
of me and she purchased it for me so I'm
really happy but it's basically just
this sweater oh my gosh how am I going
to show this
this is from brandy melville I wore this
in a video of mine I think last week and
it's like chunky and not super thick
it's actually pretty thin but I just
love the color of this I love the
neckline it's like a scoop neckline so
it goes I have pretty broad shoulders so
for me it kind of sits right here if I
want to wear it off one shoulder I could
but for someone that wasn't a swimmer or
a gymnast or something and doesn't have
his broad shoulders as me then I'm sure
this sweater would be like very loose
and hangy but I mean I love that look so
it's fine
the sleeves are full sleeves they go all
the way down but I like to roll them up
kind of like this one and have them like
three-quarter length sleeves this
sweater is pretty cropped it's not a
crop sweater like I wouldn't necessarily
consider it it's very crop but if you're
gonna be wearing something low waisted
then it might show a little bit like I
said before with anodyne top it looks
like this but I mean I normally wear
things that are more like high-waisted
too like mid waisted so this never
really shows anything so I know that
especially where I live it gets cold in
the fall like really fast really fast I
mean I'm so jealous of you guys that
live in California or anywhere in this
hope that you know in fall it's not
really that cold for us it's like we get
like maybe two months of summer a month
of fall among the spring and like eight
months of winter it's ridiculous like
I'm just so over the weather here I just
so it gets cold pretty fast where I live
so I need to be aware of that while I'm
shopping for the fall time so basically
I would wear those that sweater with
like either jean shorts when it's still
kind of warm out or skirts and then in
the fall time I would definitely wear it
with like some oh those like
high-waisted black jeans from Topshop to
have little slits on the knees those are
awesome this top I purchased from Free
People
I think I've worn this top every second
day since
bought it because it's so comfortable
it's just this like I don't know it's
called night color on the website I
don't even know how to explain it it
looks purplish on camera but it's like a
grey purple I don't even know how to
explain it but it's super nice it's
almost like brownish - it's really
oversized it has this like these buttons
that go all the way down it's called the
oversized boyfriend kindly table so it's
something that like your boyfriend wear
that's like really big on you and cozy
it covers my butt which I like because
I'd like to wear it with leggings and I
just think this is so perfect for back
to school because I could wear this with
literally anything like I could wear
this with jeans I can wear this with
shorts and obviously I wouldn't have all
the buttons I'm done I would probably
button up all the way and then I think
with some like really cute jewelry
pieces and maybe some rings and stuff
would be super cute and then the last
clothing item I want to show you guys
are actually these boyfriend jeans
they're just like the baggy boyfriend
jean jeans
I usually have them cuffed at the bottom
to show a bit of ankle they have a
distress on the knee and a little bit up
here but it's not too much skin it's
fine for school the color is super nice
they're from one teaspoon which I really
like I love the Brad one teaspoon and
the reason why I purchased from one
teaspoon is because they're jeans last
forever I pad some of their shorts I
swear to you guys I've had them for four
years four years and they're still brand
new they're amazing I love the Jean the
quality is great the reason why I'm
saying this is because they are pricier
but you are paying for the quality of
the Jean because you can even just feel
it's super soft there so like I've
washed these already and sometimes when
you wash Jean they get kind of crunchy
these are just brand new they're super
soft I love them so much and I mean I
know they do have cheaper versions of
this at forever 21 but every time I
purchased from forever 21 I have to be
purchase within like a few months
because it just gets destroyed so when I
want something that's pretty basic that
I know I will be wearing for a long time
that I think's going
something a bit more expensive is worth
it for me just because I won't have to
repurchase it because in the end this
has happened to me many times I've like
bought something similar like four times
and it turns out to be the same prices
if I just bought something like this in
the first place would you guys be
interested in seeing a back to school
makeup slash hair style video I know
some of you guys want to see like a
quick and easy hairstyle video so I
think I might do that but I don't know
if you guys want me to incorporate kind
of like a back to school makeup routine
because I know at certain schools you
can't wear any makeup I know some places
you can wear more than others at my
school we weren't allowed to wear that
much so maybe I could show you guys kind
of an easy no makeup makeup look so if
you're interested in that just let me
know down in the comment and now onto
the surprise I have for you guys I'm
sure you guys are all interested in what
this is because I have been wanting to
tell you guys for so long I've kind of
hinted about it on my Instagram and you
guys are all very curious so for the
past couple of months I have been told
multiple times for you guys that I am
all over the app called the hunt and for
a long time I was just kind of like what
is that like what do you mean I'm all
over the point what and then a couple
weeks ago I actually checked it out I
was like okay this app is really cool
this is pretty awesome basically what
the app does is you if you're scrolling
through tumblr or whatever and you come
across an outfit that you like and you
don't know where anything is from you
can like take a screenshot of it upload
it to the app and then people from the
community will basically find those
exact items for you so you can select
whether you want exact or whether you
want something similar because something
you know sometimes things are old and
they don't have the exact anymore but I
know for like Coachella and stuff when
like all the celebrities were wearing
certain things you're just like oh my
gosh where is that from so you can like
literally screenshot it and post it and
people will tell you where it's from now
for me every time I post a picture on
Instagram I tag where the articles of
clothing are from whether it be in the
description or in the photo itself but a
lot of the times people just I guess
don't know that or people repost my
pictures without giving credits the
knees or any anything like that so
people take screenshots and I went on
the app and I'm literally like all over
the homepage I was like whoa okay well I
guess I am all over the app so um I was
contacted by the app to host a little
challenge for you guys that I thought
would be really fun basically what it is
is I made a profile on the app itself
and I'm going to be posting a picture
wearing an article of clothing or like
an outfit of the day picture like I
normally post except I'm not going to be
tagging where anything is from so what I
want you guys to do is to find where
those articles of clothing are from so
I'm not gonna make it easy like brandy
Melville and all that stuff because you
guys know where I like the companies I
like to shop at most so I'm gonna make
it a bit more challenging for you guys
and I want you to go and find where
everything is from now one of you guys
who finds where the articles of clothing
are from will win a $100 gift card to
Urban Outfitters can we just
bourbon Outfitters is my like one of my
favorite stores ever I cannot go into
that store without buying something it's
really bad I'm really jealous actually
that you guys can win this because I
want this so bad and then I'm also
inviting you guys to come and follow me
on my profile on the hunt if you guys
have profiles it's free to sign up it's
free to download all that kind of stuff
it's all free and if you follow me on my
account then one of you guys will win a
$50 gift card at two Urban Outfitters so
there is the 100 dollar prize for
figuring out the outfit and then a fifty
dollar prize for following me on the app
so I thought that'd be pretty fun you
can even write like something similar so
people find like a cheaper alternative
to something then they can post that as
well which is pretty awesome and I just
think it's a really cool idea I don't
know how someone didn't think of this
sooner all the information for the like
giveaway challenge thing will be listed
down below if you have any questions in
the description thing down here it will
be listed down below and good luck to
everyone hope you guys are having a
wonderful day let me know again in the
comments if you would like to see a
makeup slash hair style tutorial video
don't forget to give this video big
thumbs up and subscribe for more and I
will see you guys all MINIX but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
