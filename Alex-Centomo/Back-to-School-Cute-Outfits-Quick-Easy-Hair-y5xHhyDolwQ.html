better do like we doin
what's up guys
so another back-to-school video for you
guys I'm so excited because I really
like back-to-school season because that
just means fall is coming and falls my
favorite season so I'm excited also I'm
not in school so I think that just makes
it a lot easier for me but I still liked
back to school when I was in school so
today I decided to make a video for you
guys it's like a combination of my
favorite hairstyles and outfits that I
would wear for back-to-school for this
time of year depends where you guys live
where I live the weather tends to still
be warm but it gets cold quite quickly
so I showed you some options for like
both types of weather also I never went
to private school and the school that I
went to these outfits you were allowed
to wear so we are allowed to wear the
only thing we weren't allowed to wear
was like spaghetti straps like the
really skinny straps and like super
cropped tops that show all your stomach
but like everything else we are allowed
to wear so that's all I know I never
went to private school I never went to
schools I had like a crazy strict
uniform but if you guys did let me know
what your uniform is and maybe I can
help you guys out in the comments or you
guys can help each other also make sure
to stay tuned till the end of the video
because I have a huge surprise slash
announcement for you guys I'm really
really excited about it so do not skip
forward watch the video and then stay
tuned till the end to see what the
surprises
can you guess comment down below and
guess what you think it is before
looking don't cheat guys I want to see
what you guys think it is so to talk
about hair for back-to-school I
typically don't usually like to use heat
but obviously I'm a girl I still like to
use it once in a while so I did a
tutorial a few days ago on how I would
curl my hair for back-to-school love
that look if you guys want to check it
out I'll leave a link down below I would
I love to wear my hair like that and I
actually for the purpose of this video
put in some extensions because I love
having long hair I know the trend right
now is to have short hair but I love
long hair and I've had short hair for so
long in my life and it's finally growing
but like I just love it so I got these
new extensions I actually want to try
out something new and I'll explain why
in a second but these are the luxy hair
extension
they're 24-inch so freakin nice okay how
natural did these look guys like
seriously look at this okay so I
actually bought all just blonde I bought
the color to match my ends like
perfectly and then I went to my
hairdresser and I was like is there any
way you can dye it to match my hair
perfectly because I've explained this in
vlogs but my hair gets so light in the
summertime because of the Sun and
nothing was matching it so I went and
actually got them dyed perfectly to
match my hair color that's pretty
awesome right so what's cool about it is
that when I put them in they're
completely blended I don't wear too much
I just wear four tracks it comes with a
lot more and also comes with just like
one clip to kind of put them in anywhere
but I don't have like a crazy amount of
hair so this does me just fine I really
really like them so if you're interested
in purchasing extensions I will have a
link for you down below as well as a
discount code for you guys where you can
get five dollars off your purchase which
is awesome thanks to luck say forgive me
this discount code for you guys I like
ask them I was like can I get something
for my subscribers and they were super
nice about it so love these I wore them
in all tutorials you could still wear
these hairstyles with shorter hair it's
not like only for long hair obviously
without further ado let's get into the
video
you me my
cause the guys had to be the
amazed you do for me so happy together
this is something I would have learned
so much in high school I love the
distressed denim look especially the
boyfriend look and then this super
simple tee that just says chocolate on
it it just completely ties the look
together I love it so much so effortless
but yet casual and I don't know I just
really like this kind of look for school
the jeans are by one teaspoon and the
top is by wild Fox but I got them both
on revolve clothing calm love it
there must be something in the water and
it must be something not you dirty she
said I love him nothing but a master my
love ain't nothing but a monster will -
yeah
this outfit literally screams school to
me I love it so much the top is from
Windsor the shorts are just vintage
Levi's that I got from Urban Outfitters
and the shoes are just classic bad slip
ons and this hairstyle is so amazing I
got it from amber fill er up love her
tutorials so much and I just think it
looks perfect with the extensions and
everything about this just screams
school to me I'm obsessed with it I
don't know about you guys but I
personally don't like when hairs in my
face especially when I start to go back
to school so I think this is like a
perfect alternative to have your hair
out of your face without having to put
your hair up in a ponytail or a bun or
anything and it's just super cute and
effortless and looks like you put a lot
of time into it but it literally took me
five minutes I'm not even kidding
this next outfit is like my sporty-er
gym attire I'd say the top is from
Windsor the leggings are from garage
clothing and the shoes are just the
classic Nike running shoes so cute all
black and I know I would love to wear
this to school because it's so
comfortable but still really chic
this outfit is such an Alex outfit
because of the sweater and the shorts
loves combination and the socks and
shoes how cute is that guys I feel like
I'm like in the 80s or something I don't
know the sweater is from garage the
shorts or one teaspoon the socks it from
garage and my shoes are just classic
converse bungalow with some strange new
friends stay up to face come to stand
we promise each other it's till the end
now we're spinning empty bottles it's
the five of us pretty eyed boys girls by
the trust again
no I can't resist
this last outfit is so casual and cute
I'm obsessed with it so the shorts of
course were just my 1tsp shorts I'm
wearing my superstar classic adidas so
comfortable and then my shirt is from
brandy melville the Hat is from Urban
Outfitters and I just think that this
whole look is so cute I know that in
September it sometimes gets a little bit
chilly and it might be too cold to wear
this so you can always throw on a really
comfy sweater it just adds something
even more sporty this one is from garage
it's so soft and so comfortable I'm
obsessed with it and I love the color
combination of this whole outfit I just
think it's so nice thank you to white
houses so hope you guys enjoyed this

hard at all and I feel like I've done
tutorials like this and there's a bunch
