heartbreak away
never let me down
oh it's been
the edge of a knife never let you go
I will give up
you happy
how's my hair look cuz I can't see good
okay don't make noise what's up what's
up guys welcome back to my channel if
you are new here and you haven't seen my
last video I did a back to school haul
where I showed you guys a lot of my
favorite clothing pieces that I
personally would wear for back-to-school
and I said in that video that I would be
filming a back-to-school lookbook for
you guys I have not done a proper
lookbook in months and as well if you
guys have been subscribed to me for a
long time you will know that I loved you
look books all the time and it felt so
good doing one again it felt like it's
been like years but I just want to say
before I get started that these are
clothing pieces that I was allowed to
wear to my school my high school
University College whatever this was
allowed so I don't know what your
uniform is like or your dress dress code
but if you can't wear shorts you can
always opt for jeans if your knowledge
wear leggings or not to wear like
spaghetti straps you could just put a
t-shirt on everything that I'm showing
can be switched around a little bit so I
hope you guys enjoy it and if you're
curious to see what I would wear for
back-to-school then just keep on
watching for this first outfit I thought
this would be perfect for a chillier day
for back-to-school
where I'm from it's not too hot and not
too cold it's kind of an in-between so
this would be perfect for that kind of
day I love this look of like high-top
sneakers with sock sticking out and you
can find such cute ones at like urban or
forever but I didn't have any so I
literally stole my dad's socks and that
is how this outfit was inspired
I'll of everything about this piece - I
think it's just perfect for this time of
year Mutual colors really comfy and yeah
super cute
this next one I had no idea that you
could actually see my skin all the way
down when I was wearing it in person you
definitely could not so if this is a
little bit too inappropriate for school
you could definitely wear a sort of like
tank top underneath or a bondo kind of
top that covers the boobie area but
other than that this is still a really
cute top and if you are not allowed to
wear shorts at school you could
definitely wear this with jeans I still
think would be cute any of the outfits
really you can switch up the shorts for
jeans or leggings whatever you prefer
and as well if you get kind of cold you
can throw over a cardigan I still think
that would be really cute to have like
the knot lace but like strings showing
through that makes any sense probably
not now on to this outfit this I think
is my favorite one just because it's so
vintage looking I actually got this top
off a vintage sight but I love how it's
cropped but still really baggy and
oversized that's like totally my look
right now and with anything high waisted
would be appropriate because you're not
showing your stomach or anything like
that with sneakers and also my hair I
just I'm loving this like 90's vibe
right now and I love this color as well
I feel like if they had this in a light
yellow I'd be all over that I'm like
really into light yellow right now
this one is super cash if you can't wear
spaghetti straps you could totally wear
a t-shirt with this and jeans of course
but I love oversized anything really but
oversized flannels with baseball caps
are so up my alley and I just really
loved the way that this looks all
together very neutral colors and simple
this is my second favorite just because
it has a super oversized a denim jacket
but again
this can go with anything so t-shirt
jeans leggings whatever you literally
throw on this jacket and it's awesome if
you feel like you're going to be hot at
school then totally wear like a really
thin lightweight t-shirt underneath so
you could take it off but if not you
could totally wear spaghetti strap if
you like also I just realized how many
times I say totally and cute in this
video and it's really driving me crazy
I'm sorry guys oh yeah and that's me
taking a selfie because Lowell why not
honestly I was probably snapchatting so
I hope you guys enjoyed that video
everything of course will be listed down
below for you guys with all the links as
much as I can find some vintage pieces
obviously I can't give exact but I will
find either similar or just the website
on its own so you guys can browse
through yourselves and if you guys want
to let me know what your dress code is
for back-to-school or even what you are
planning on wearing or what you did wear
for the first day slash week I'm so
curious about that stuff don't forget
that I love you guys so much and gives
me a thumbs up if you liked it and more
back school videos are coming very soon
so don't worry about that guys got you I
love you guys I'll see you all in my
next video bye
woke up this evening hearing my
heartbeat and now I'm falling too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
