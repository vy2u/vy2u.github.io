questions on my back-to-school lookbook
video on like hairstyle ideas on how to
do the braided hairstyle that I did in
that and I was actually like the easiest
hairstyle for me to do but I don't know
how well it's gonna be like doing it in
front of a camera cuz I don't have a
mirror behind me so I'm gonna do as best
as I can for you guys hopefully it won't
be too complicated it's one of my
favorite hairstyles to do ever so before
I get into that I just want to say that
for this hairstyle I like to have very
long thick hair so I'm wearing my lucky
hair extensions that I showed in my last
video when I did the lookbook and stuff
so I'm only using four tracks I'm using
just one of the four clips one of the
three clips no two of the three clips
and one of the two clips just like for
my ears down since I'm gonna be working
mostly up here I didn't need to put any
extensions there but I did want the
length and the volume if you guys could
see how long and beautiful it is so and
also as well as that I did add some
texture spray just to give it more of
like a textured look duh and that's all
I do
oh and before I use heat obviously heat
protection so important because as you
guys know I don't use heat that often
and I try not to but sometimes I want to
so I use he productive you will need an
elastic if you can find a clear elastic
even better but I'm literally all out of
them and I'm just gonna use this because
whatever it's not a big deal if you are
interested in these Luxy extensions
obviously I will have a discount code
for you guys listed down below because I
love you guys and I'm gonna I did add
some dry shampoo because my hair tends
to be a little bit flat and I wanted a
little bit of volume so I use the bumble
and bumble one anyways let's get into
this video because oh I want to show you
guys how to make this so and I hope this
isn't focus for you guys I'm trying my
hardest here it's hard doing this solo
just letting you know
I'm gonna start off with a section like
this above your head and you're gonna
start braiding one strand under the
other so you have your three pieces and
you're gonna make sure the two outside
pieces cross underneath each other like
that kind of doing a Dutch braid
then what you're going to do once you
did one cross you're going to take a
section from the outside we're going to
connect it underneath
I do the same thing with the other side
so and then you're going to continue
braiding
are you gonna do it again just take
random little sections
but you're just gonna play with the
brain pull out parts
so I hope you guys enjoyed that little
tutorial let me know in the comments
down below if you would like to see
other types of hairstyles this is just
like my favorite thing to do especially
if I have to go back to school because
my hair is out of my face and I don't
have to worry about it throughout the
day and it still looks super cute and
awesome from the back if you do recreate
this hairstyle make sure you tag me on
Instagram or Twitter so that I can see
it and I will definitely retweet it and
like your pictures and stuff so I love
you guys all so much and I will see you
all in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
