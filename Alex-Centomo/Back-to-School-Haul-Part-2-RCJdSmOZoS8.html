cousin Sofia you have seen her before
and my pictures on Instagram as well as
a few videos here on YouTube and we
decide to film a kind of like back to
school haul part two because a lot of
you guys want to see more option for
like different things you can wear for
back to school I know a lot of you guys
have uniforms so this stuff could like
apply to you for the weekends like you
have a uniform yeah I do which pretty
much sucks yeah but that's okay you can
wear it like this stuff on weekend stuff
so so the first thing I want to show you
guys are actually these jeans that I
bought yesterday you did you're so lucky
I want them there the Jamie jeans from
Topshop I know these are like so popular
over social media but like I really
wanted to try them I don't have a pair
of high-waisted jeans believe it or not
so I just wanted a pair of high-waisted
jeans these are the ones with the slits
in the knees
and I actually wear them cuffed like on
the ankle so you see a little bit of my
ankles I really like them they're kind
of like a dark gray light black color
I've just really wanted to try them for
a long time they're super comfortable
super stretchy and they're perfect for
school because they don't feel like
jeans but they look like jeans and
especially since they're high-waisted
you can wear them with crop tops so I
just really like these a lot so jealous
I have these black jeans actually from
American Eagle they're with a lot of
rips and all right cool yeah they're
really nice I like I wear them all the
time
I love the high waisted no they're low
waisted because I have a
so you want to get Lois and stuff yeah
you have a lot of yeah I like the ribs
they're really cool and I find like
what's great about jeans especially like
black jeans is that they're like really
yeah they're versatile for like all
season so it's fall winter spring summer
no matter what you can wear black jeans
so it's great about those is that you
can literally wear them all the time all
the time next thing for me is this
cropped t-shirt from brandy melville and
it looks really white and washed on
camera but it's actually a very pale
pink and I really like this color a lot
it's just props with a pocket on the
sleeve but I would actually wear these
with the high-waisted Jamie past I just
showed because then you don't see any
skin because stuff like where the
high-waisted goes compared to this crop
top like it goes exactly at the right
spot so that there's no skin showing and
I really like right like a dark grey
with a light pink I think it's so pretty
together plus it really just suits my
skin tone so I think this is great
yeah I really like the pocket on it I'm
really cute it's like super soft
obviously it's brand-new yeah I wear
this all the time it's just a big like
comfy sweater stripe like Perkins
sweater sweater but my thing t-shirt
v-neck t-shirt huge
this actually like this material I don't
know what it is but it's like stretchy
and comfy and like you floated in it's
amazing like floating and this too is
like perfect for fall as well because
the color is so next it's kind of
similar to like the style t-shirt I
showed you before but it's not crop it's
actually long and this one is just like
a navy blue and white striped t-shirt
and again this one just has a pocket on
the left side it's like the same
material as a shirt she just showed it's
really loose baggy and comfortable and I
find like when it comes to school being
comfortable it's super important or like
weekends
yeah stupid uniform but like this is so
comfortable and you can get away wearing
this is like a pajama top or as a
t-shirt and I just really like it it's
so cute I have um a rump er yeah I
brought proof American Apparel it's just
like white and it's shorts and t-shirt
and the back has like a little button
detail a button detailing that like ties
up
it's really cute yeah well so it makes
your tan look really good oh it's true
there's still tad from the summer guys
don't as much as I used to be yeah she
was in Greece for a while and she was
pretty dark yeah I was I think like with
that white romper like some little black
booties and like a floppy hat it's just
like yeah super cute okay a lot of my
stuff is from brandy it's really nice
okay so this sweater is like my new
favorite sweater or cardigan it's like I
don't know how to show this I'll insert
like all like pictures and stuff for you
guys to see but this is basically just
like an oversized cardigan it's kind of
like the Mosel at brandy you know like
the knitted material it's just like big
and it's grey which is like perfect for
fall time I really like it
it's like loose and the sleeves are kind
of like bell sleeves and I just find
throwing this over any outfit is just so
comfortable and what it's great about
this cardigan is that it's not too thick
so you can wear it at this time of year
and you're not hot it's more for like
when you're inside like Ana classroom
where you're going lik to the mall or
something and it's kind of a little
chilly you can just throw it on and it
just like completes the outfit but I
don't know if you guys can see it's like
the holes are pretty big but yeah I just
really like it a lot the color is like
awesome it's just gray okay I'm in love
with this
I'm more like on the tomboy side for
clothes and this is just I fell in love
with this as soon as I saw it's more
like a football seems like a Jersey I
know the insurance et chaque these tops
are really in right now like I love it
I'm in love with it where'd you get that
one Topshop this is actually from
Topshop yeah oh nice well shout out to
all of you guys from LA yep
I usually wear this will actually the
jeans I showed ya jeans I wear that with
that or just a pair of black shorts and
like my doc martens or converse shoes
perfect it's like so simple yeah so cute
okay literally everything in this hauls
from Brandi and I didn't even realize
this I was just grabbing your Sadam this
sweaters from Brandi it's like an
oversized knit sweater and I just like
it because of the sleeves they have
these two striped things and it's not
too thick the sweater it's pretty thin
so it's nice for like the fall but it's
not crop or anything it's just like a
normal sized sweater and I would wear
this with just like normal jeans like
any size jeans doesn't really matter or
like some boyfriend jean shorts I know
it looks really good but yeah I just
thought this was like to school
appropriate cuz of like the sleeves I
was really cool and she told me that she
could actually wear this school cause
it's like her school it's my school
colors yet I got these shorts from
Brandi I sold them in one of more in
Elizabeth's videos and I was like this
is so cute shoutout to you love Laura
yeah I had to get them they're just like
a little flowy and cute and thin shorts
and you wear the high waisted are low
waist
I wear them high waisted actually cuz I
finally always deserve it
yeah so yeah and you can wear this with
like any crop any like I mostly wear it
with block actually yeah what would be
nice yeah a halter oh yeah and then
obviously if you're somewhere where you
can't be showing your shoulders you can
throw over cardigan but for weekends
it's fun like that great cardigan she
showed oh thank you
the last thing I have to show you guys
it's just this like super simple tea
from brandy it's just it's like they're
Giselle tea if you guys know what that
is but it's not really cropped so it
just like looks like this it's a regular
t-shirt I would wear this with something
more high waisted because if I wore like
normal waisted jeans it probably will
show a little bit of like my lower
stomach and then the back kind of goes
lower which is really nice and I think
with like a bra let where you can see
like the lace coming out from behind
it's like so nice I have like a bralette
from free people that kind of goes lower
in the back and you can see that the
lace detailing if you wear something
that's kind of open back and like the
material of course is just super soft
Brandi's like really good quality
clothing and like it's pretty cheap I
mean obviously there's sweaters and
stuff are more on the pricier side but
like their t-shirts and their basic
stuff is like so affordable at least for
me like I find it's like this it's a
good steal compared to like Topshop or
yo yeah her romper that she had some
American Apparel there selling the black
one at Brandis so if you guys are
interested in gaining like 60 bucks at
American Apparel or 30 by 30 bucks
Brandi yeah and as my last thing I have
this little cropped tank top from
Topshop it's really cute and it's just
like in the back it's the same cut as in
the front yeah it's like a simple black
crop top but you can wear this with like
high-waisted jeans shorts or heart
weights the jeans high-waisted skirt
would be really key ID is really cute hi
mommy hi mom I think she buck called me
before we end this hall Sh
so if you actually just want to show you
like two products of hers that are like
her go-to products for school when it
comes to makeup cuz I know a lot of you
guys can't really wear makeup at school
but there's always like the no makeup
makeup look yeah I look super natural so
first I have a foundation from Tarte in
the color in the color light neutral and
I'm the NARS concealer
honey honey nice and like I was with her
Sephora when we were like picking out
makeup and stuff and she helped me pick
it out what we like about Tarte and like
what I really like about Tarte because
I've been using a lot of Tarte products
is that it's very like organic and for
someone that's like having a lot of
breakouts or whatever you know you don't
want to be putting a lot of chemicals on
your face like I have really really oily
skin like it's pretty bad like I get
breakouts like every day so this is
really good like I suggest this yeah I
like that one's really nice plus the
concealer from NARS is like a little bit
goes a long way and it really does
conceal like you put a little bit on a
spot and you just dab it in with your
finger and like it works really really
well so like at school doesn't mean like
when you count wear makeup you count
where like my shadow lipstick it's not
that
but it's like you can wear with that but
let's see your ring red eyeshadow or
blue something that's popping out and
it's really like yeah like it bothers
teachers kind of like you can't dye your
hair pink yeah what about like nail
polish nail polish you're allowed that
is all for our haul today I hope you
guys enjoyed it I just figured I'd film
with Sophia because we're like hanging
out a lot because we're just best
friends
