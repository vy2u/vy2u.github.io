been a while since she's been on my main
channel she's always in my blog wait big
announcement at the end for ya big
announcement so stay tuned yeah talaash
until the end don't skip so we figured
today that we would talk a bit about
just like like life hacks how to stay
organized in school like tips and tricks
and stuff because I don't know about
sofyan I don't know about you guys but I
was very organized person in school
extremely organized goes for me too okay
so I mean at the beginning of the year
was like very organized and then like it
would kind of not be as much but then it
like every semester I get photos yeah
you know yeah so we have a bunch of
stuff right here that we're gonna like
show and talk about so um do you want to
go first okay we can start for Locker I
guess yeah locker okay so I'm gonna keep
your locker super organized locker is
probably the most important thing school
because you keep all your books there
right my favorite thing about lockers
buying one of these things oh yeah love
these so in the winter i'll put my
winter boots under and like i'll put my
binders on top and well if you live in a
country that snows yeah i think of an
internship snows or you can just get
multiple them and like stacked books and
different ones i find it so much easier
instead of like just piling books and
throwing it in your long hair like you
have more organization with that I used
to like I used to usually have to so I'd
have like one at the bottom and then
there used to be these ones that like
you put in and then you'd open and they
kind of like stick to the walls yeah
they have those anymore I used to have
that so it would be a bit higher up
because I always want have to bend down
so I'd have it a bit higher up and I'd
have liked my most used books there yeah
like I normally like well I use these
ones that i just showed yeah and I'll
put like like let's see my school
schedule I'll always have that right on
fling open my door and my school
schedules there or I'll put it in my
Jenda okay agenda for school planner I
don't know about Canadian works I don't
know because I always hear people sing
like my planner so I just touching but
another really really important thing
when it comes to being organized
highlighters III comin or okay use a lot
of my letters I use different colored
pens you let to I have like a learning
right here so i would have this all fun
color pens nan jal pants like actual
pins but they'd be different colors and
i would have liked let's say like this
book for example this would be like my
english binder my english notebooks so
I'd have a good thing that's an English
on it and then inside I would use like
for whatever section we are doing in
english i would like usually do let's
say this is empty guys i just bought
these yesterday one doesn't have it Wow
oh good job staples yeah shout out to
you yeah so let's say this is a pen cuz
I usually depends i don't know if you
guys did Spencer highlighters so let's
say this was I use a pink pen for all of
my titles so I would like title what we
are doing and then like everything I
would title and then everything else I'd
use a different color pen and that way
just help me keep organized Rose I write
everything in black pen and then I just
highlight like the important man like
what I like to do to like as Alex was
saying for notebooks I as you can see I
always get the same color notebooks
every notebook is the same color all my
binders are white and I just like to
know on the side so others saying when I
stack them up like I could see oh this
is my there's nothing here but this is
my math binder so things like that like
i like to keep the same color whereas
like the pens inside are always
different but then like how do you know
if this is english or science if they're
both black because they're in the binder
oh you put them in the binder
because they like most like subjects
required just have loosely sheets and I
I purpose like I was loose leaf she yes
same so I prefer just having a notebook
and a notebook it's easier to put in
your bag than a binder so I'll just take
the no no I guess it depends too on
where you went because like in high
school for me binders were like
mandatory that you had to have a binder
when I went to college um everything was
like your decision so what I would do is
I would buy it was on a binder but it
wasn't a binder it was like so it was
like a notebook with instead of pages
inside and had like folders so I would
have that for every class I'd have each
folder had a section so it would be like
English humanities science whatever each
and all the like papers that they would
give you I would put in those files so
that's like my main thing that I bring
to every class as well as a notebook so
I would always have things like this I
hated binders because they were just
took up so much room in this very room
don't bring her binder home just bring
this it's so much if you have to have a
binder and then that makes sense but I
used to love things like this so you can
get different sizes and stuff and I
would get this for clues lead and for
graph paper when I was like in physics
all that kind of stuff cause I need to
graph oh there we go grandma so I need
that for like physics and for math and
then I would like use those and then as
well as I always had a super organized
pencil case and agenda I love doing that
but I'm another trick okay so in not in
history we have like these what do they
call minus it
looks like this how like hard cover
books like this I'm like they have like
sitting hardcover books like this and
like they normally have exercises nom
and stuff but his books you can't write
in so my math teacher will be like okay
page 167 number three you have to do
that for homework so be like I don't
want to bring home is heavy book take
your phone take a picture of it and then
bring it home and you'll have a picture
of it and it's so much easier and you
you don't carry that weight in your bag
that is so smart yeah wow I never even
so I always do that for homework I just
take a picture when I was in high school
phones with pictures didn't think this
so but now it does yeah or like if you
don't have a good like a phone that
takes like a good nice picture have your
friend do it or someone else and just
have them send have them i'm going to
show you wow I wish that existed back
then yeah um and then for as an agenda
do you have your agenda oh my god your
agenda so big what the heck is this my
grade 10 inch of this was a mess okay I
don't know how your agendas were and she
writes Justin Bieber on the back in from
what my gen did not even look like that
will we had totally different agendas
who met Jade Brooks and hugged him ok so
my agenda was literally okay this is her
agenda mine went like from here to like
this mostly suppose literally smell like
that but it was like sticker and it's
weird you don't have like a mess yours
are strange I don't know ugly ok so i
right my thanks and I'm like well as
I've done them i'll highlight them like
here they're highlighted in pink ok so
what I would do in my agenda cuz mine is
obviously way better than hers that
would have subjects so I would have like
maths whatever subjects I had that day
I'd have math science English let's say
and then I would write whatever homework
I have for that day and then if ever we
got an assignment what i would do is i
flipped to that page and I would
highlight it like I'm gonna do me like
this is due and then I would also put
reminders throughout like all the
weekends leading up to that being like
two more weeks till this is do one more
way to Lissa's do and
for like exams like the exam periods
like I'll draw out the hour and like
yeah square so that was really important
for me everything you need to be like
highlighted and color-coordinated having
an organized agenda very important color
coordination for me really worked well
with staying organized and also having
neat writing helps I find when I'm like
writing super fast i get like very
distracted so this is something that's a
bit OCD in a bit crazy but I would like
go home and rewrite my notes if I had to
look right too fast okay I don't do that
a lot I was my gran guys I was looking
at my notes once i was reading my
history notes at the end of the year I
guess I was kind of falling asleep in
class and my writing went from super
nice to like really small under the wine
like what that kind of happens to the
best of us I'm like you know what is
this my right here but I there the great
thing is that one like when I was in
university I would love to be my laptop
to school so it was like so much easier
having file just everything on my
computer but I know a lot of you guys
can't do that in high school if you
can't bring a laptop that obviously
these are perfect tricks for you guys
and another really important trick for
me is I did my homework like as soon as
I got home yeah like obviously if I had
my sports idea would do that but as soon
as I got home I would do my homework
like right away because if I like
procrastinated even just a little bit it
would like take forever to do my work
and it just puts so much stress on you
and I know like doing homework is the
last thing you want to do but seriously
doing it as soon as you get home your
brain is still fresh from school and you
can just get it over with and same for
assignments like I would do them like
the first weekend and then the next week
and after that I would kind of like
revise it and like make sure is good if
your teacher in class gives like a fast
lesson and then gives you time to do
your homework in class do it in class I
swear to god your teachers there you can
ask him or her questions and it's so
much easier because you're gonna regret
it when you get there at night and
you're like why did I do it
I know just do it in class like my dad
always says like take the road that like
take the harder path if you're faced
with two paths and one is easy when it's
hard take the harder one because in the
end like down the road is going to be
easier whereas if you take this short
like that easier one right now you're
gonna have to still get to the same
place so it's going to take a lot longer
in in the long run so just get it over
with you know just do it Joshua z0 yeah
staying I guess motivated when it comes
to school or trying to stay focused that
was kind of an issue for me and I know
for Kyle as well staying focused in
class I would get distracted quite as
like I'm letting you know like are you
like okay I'm not I'm going no I'm going
to I'm going to class I'm gonna focus
i'm gonna listen to everything the
teacher saying i'd be sitting there and
I'd be focusing so hard on trying to
listen that I'd be like not even paying
attention because I just be saying like
okay focus okay focus and I'll be like
so confused and I'd be like a little flu
okay what I like to do is because I get
distracted very easily as she's saying
and like I speak a lot of cutting costs
and I'll get in trouble with that but
ask to sit in the front of class the
first to the second row I always do that
I always switch for the first or second
row and I swear to God because the
teachers rain from you you are going to
focus so much more and you're gonna
realize that you have you have less to
study because you remember from what you
listen to in clause for me is a bit
different because I wasn't the kind of
person that like when someone's
explaining something to me I have to
write it down because I don't have very
good memory like retaining information
people talk it's kind of like I need to
process it so I write everything down
and then when I go back home later when
i have time i kind of like review it and
that's how I retain my information
because I know there's a lot of Google
better like you but I know I'll stairs a
lot of people that are like me that have
more of a difficult time like retaining
information my sister was the same way
so just notes are very important um if
you miss a day of school try to get
notes from somebody else that's very
important don't like skip out on notes
cuz you need them never be embarrassed
to ask a question trust me yeah I as i
said before i'm very interactive so i'll
ask questions kossel make fun of me but
there's a hundred percent that another
student yeah that same question in there
yes so trust me it's not a stupid
question like a skit and get here
embarrassed go before class and ask the
teacher wait after class because you got
to get that question you got to get that
answer you know don't go into it feeling
like they're gonna think stupid for
asking or what if they already set in i
just went out listening who cares you
don't know the answer so you need to
know the answer so just ask it like I
physically had someone like because they
were so shy they told me to ask the
question so I didn't class laughed but
the girl about her hands yeah that's so
cute I was definitely that person that
was Shyne ask questions like so Shawn or
like in my mind's like if the teacher
asked a question I knew the answer I'd
still be shy to raise my hand so I was
like what what if it's wrong and then
someone else would answer and I'm like
oh I knew it I should have said
something so I hope you guys enjoy this
