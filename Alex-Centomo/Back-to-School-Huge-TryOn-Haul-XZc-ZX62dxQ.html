channel if you guys have been subscribed
to you for a while you know that every
single year I you a back-to-school
series and I was contemplating doing it
this year because as you well I don't
know if you guys know this but I've been
done school for years oh I'm not going
back to school so I don't think I didn't
think I was gonna do it this year but I
got so many requests from you guys on
Instagram and on Twitter to do my series
again so that is why I'm here with a
back to school haul it's my favorite
kind of video to film because hauls were
just like my personal favorite videos to
watch because I'm like super nosy and
every time I watch a haul I end up
buying stuff which is like bad but so
what I did was I kind of picked things
from places that I normally would have
shopped off like from anyways but kind
of me to put the closet but kind of made
it applicable to school I don't know
your guys's dress code I'm going based
off what was okay for me so if this
wasn't okay for you I'm so sorry you
guys can completely alternate whatever
it is but this was okay for my school
whether it be high school or university
I don't know if there's dress code but
we're just going to help right into it
I'm going to start with accessories
actually because accessories are
something that I always kind of forget
about and they're pretty important so
the first things I want to talk about
are these shoes these shoes are
everywhere on social media right now
like it's crazy and I know like most
people have the Gucci ones but these are
from princess Polly they're like I don't
know a tenth of the price of the Gucci
ones and they're like identical and
they're so comfy so they're just a
simple black loafers the slide on ones
and they are I mean they're super dirty
because I've been wearing them a ton but
this is totally something I would wear
back to school because they're really
comfortable they're easy to put on you
don't feel like climb up or whatever and
it's just like I'm all about the comfort
and the simple when it comes to going to
school
and although the first week I used to
always try to like dress nice and wear
my new stuff and be excited and then
like by the second week I was already my
leggings and oversized shirts and
whatever but these are still could dress
up an outfit even if you're wearing
leggings and an oversized shirt so again
I'm going to have everything listed in
the description box for you guys so I
also have a promo code for princess
Polly so I always forget to say it in my
videos but if you guys want like $20
offering or 20% off your first order
I'll have a link down below um this belt
is also from princess quality I have
been looking for about that's you know
pretty thick like this this type of
style that can go around my height with
the high points of my waist so I can
wear it with really high-waisted jeans
or really high waisted shorts and for
some reason I've had such a hard time
finding one that actually fit properly
even at urban or for ever like I just
could not find one and this one fits
perfectly it's a right amount of chunky
that I like and I usually wear it on the
first or second hole and it just looks
so nice and it kind of puts together any
outs that you have that's really basic
so I personally like to wear it with a
really simple shirt and just plain
simple jeans you have your belt and the
look is put together and looks so nice
um then I have these shoes these shoes
are from Windsor and they are like the
espadrille style shoes I think that's
how you say espadrille anyways I really
like the nude colors I think this would
be really nice with like just again a
basic outfit but because they're new
they can go with so many different
things and again it's super easy to just
slide your foot in they give you a
little bit of height with the platform
and I thought this is a really good
transition from summer to fall basic
foot you guys know me basic is in I love
it I think this would be so cute with
just simple jeans and like a white
oversized tee or a white crop tee that
still kind of touches your life stick
high waisted jeans and some kind of like
I don't know bomber throwing over ok
then I'm going to move on to bottom so I
have this black denim skirt this is from
princess Polly as well and I know skirts
are always like hit or miss when it
comes to people and especially with
uniforms but the rule of my school was
like the fingertip rule so it was like
at your fingertips when your arms are
straight down then it was fine to wear a
skirt this length would be perfect so it
has this like cut detailing it's pretty
distressed and it has a really nice
buckle on top something like this with a
cropped sweater and sneakers I love that
look and I thought blocks is pretty good
because it's you know kind of goes with
everything plus skirts just make an
outfit so like girly but still kind of
dress down like you can kind of do both
with it if that makes any sense out of
them I sense I just really like the
skirt and I really like the way it looks
uh then I got these leggings from ASOS
their firms
just like the adidas leggings but I
figured if you're going to wear leggings
to school at least make them look like
real cool and have a good design on it
or something and then go up pretty like
decently high so this was a cropped
white tee or just a cropped sweater or
even an oversize sure it would be so
nice and there the navy blue ones so I
thought I would go with like a lot of
white options with some sneakers
you got that sporty kind of vibe going
on but that's like super on-trend right
now it's this whole sport we're saying
like you look like you're going to the
gym but you're not but you know the
whole thing going on then speaking of a
comfort I got two jeans from Erika style
and they are the most comfortable not
even just saying this there are the most
comfortable jeans like they feel like
leggings or sub pants or something and
they just hug your body and they're so
cute and they're so affordable so the
first pair I got I think they're called
the classic stretch that are something a
high waisted ankle jegging so I got this
color and there's a bit of distress and
then at the end there a little bit
frayed and this color goes with
everything you know you got I don't
really only many jeans this light wash
but they make the booty look great
super comfortable I post them on
Instagram and everyone like loved them
and was asking where they were so
Cristal then I got a dark wash too and
this one is the high-waisted cropped
jegging so this one has distressing on
the knees as well a bit of a distressed
bottom these are a bit more cropped
still super cute I connected the word
cute these actually looks so nice with
the little purse issue at the beginning
that with a cropped sweater and some
just like reading glasses or something I
love wearing jeans for back-to-school
but if it's still super hot where you
guys live obviously switch up for like
jeans jean shorts or something I was
personally allowed to wear jean shorts
that were like high-waisted whatever I
don't know if you guys are low such it
was always fine with my school
now onto top so this is again super
random but it's from ASOS and it's an
oversized grey long-sleeve shirt and I
know this looks like kind of basic and
just plain and not boring but like you
know kind of boring but what I love
about these types of teas is first of
all they look like your boyfriend's tea
but you can really dress this up like
roll up the sleeve push them high up
anything oversized right now is super
trendy for some reason but I like love
it because I love oversized everything
but if you like kind of rolled it up and
tied it and then we're some really cute
jeans really cute shoes had a bunch of
accessories how cute would that be with
a shirt like this you know something so
basic and I think this was like twelve
dollars or something I'm going to try
and find it I think it I think wasn't a
guy section look so cute cute keep it on
the great trend we have this long sleeve
crop to you from brandy melville super
simple and basic it's not really cropped
I'm saying cropped but it's it's
honestly not that crop like you can wear
it with normal jeans and your stomach
won't show but because I have broader
shoulders it brings up the top a bit
more so it looks a little more propped
on me I just love these tees they're
super lightweight so you won't sweat and
you can roll up the sleeves it has this
just simple pocket with the American
flag it says USA but you know Brandi it
has always cute little logos
and I really think this looks so good to
the ten so clearly coming back to school
from the summer then look hand and gonna
be really cute cute
okay last gracing I promise it's a great
sweater don't kill me I actually wore it
last night and I got makeup on it so you
guys have like a trick to not get makeup
on the front here like it for some
reason it always happens like my neck
makeup always gets onto my shirt and I
spray it and I set the makeup and it
just always happen button off this is a
basic gray knit from princess Polly
I love how wide the sleeves are and at
the ends are a bit tighter so you can
just like push up up like this and they
just stay and it looks really nice and
because of the high neckline it looks so
pretty with a bunch of chokers and if
you hide the backpack on simple denim
jeans with some loafers or some sneakers
like Ben's and you could have this kind
of tucked into the jeans super
comfortable and super fashionable and
looks so nice plus if it is a bit of a
chillier day or if the ACU super strong
in school this would be a good but it's
like more of a I don't consider this a
winter sweater because it's pretty thin
but you know I live in Canada so the
winters here are pretty intense then I
have this bodysuit from Windsor and
Windsor right now has really cute basic
pieces especially for back-to-school I
thought this color was really nice so
it's a simple bodysuit and it's just a
t-shirt but it has a high neckline and
this is perfect for layering like if you
want to wear this with like a ball or
thrown over or a denim jacket you know
you can kind of dress it up in that
sense you can even wear a leather jacket
over it any kind of jewelry would look
good with it this type of color looks
good on any skin tone any hair color
it's just like the perfect color for
back-to-school I just think this is like
if you were going to get anything get
this it's so comfortable and the
bodysuit
I know it's kind of annoying to wear a
body suit but I don't know what it is
about this one but it's a bit longer and
it is a snap one so if you were in the
bathroom I just like unsnap it real
quick some princess Polly I bought
a really cute tank I thought the color
was really awesome and gives off kind of
a 70s vibe and it says offense on it I
don't let the brand name but I think
this vibe is very like 70s high school
and I really like it tank tops were
allowed at my school if you had like a
jacket over it so again really good
piece for layering if you're not tank
tops I know that princess probably does
have this and like t-shirt style and
stuff so you can definitely check that
out but for some reason this just
reminds me of like Selena Gomez and I
love her at the moment
and this color I'm obsessed like mustard
so nice looks good again on like every
single skin tone any hair color just and
the last two pieces are for mainly
layering so if you were to wear a tank
top or something
I think denim jackets super on-trend
right now I see them everywhere and you
guys know I own like a million blue
denim jackets but I saw this white one
on Windsor and I got in like the largest
size I think it's like a larger and
extra-large and it's just a distressed
white denim jacket I love the distressed
look and if you were wearing you know
like this underneath how nice would that
look even with like shorts it'd be so
pretty
oversized denim jackets are just my
thing right now and especially if you
roll up the sleeves this is going to be
cute with this and then the last piece
is something like this so camo is making
a comeback and a lot of people are not
okay with it I personally really like
how I've always been a fan like ever
since I was a kid I loved it so I'm fine
on it but this is again from Windsor
it's I got like a big size so it could
be oversized it's a little bit cross
like it's not super long but it has been
distressing on the bottom long sleeves
that I would roll up this over top of
any kind of white t-shirt with some
black or blue jeans and some sneakers so
nice and it just gives a really cool
touch to any kind of outfit that you
have on and add something a bit
different so even if you don't really
want to try hard you kind of just like
throw it on on your way out school and
make sure outfit look complete really
nice so that is everything that I'm
going to show you for back to school I
am signing on doing a back-to-school
lookbook with some of these options but
also other options that I'm just waiting
for to get into the mail I want to make
it applicable to you guys so let me know
if you have a dress code at your school
and what that dress code is because I
really want to make sure I can help but
clearly I'm not going to I can't do a
video for uniforms because I don't like
I've never went to a school with a
uniform and I don't own uniforms so it's
like hard to know sizes video so
unfortunately these types of videos are
for people that don't have like the
typical school uniform with the kills
and the dress shirt and all that kind of
stuff I don't know anything about
because I never want to scroll like that
but yeah let me know down below in the
comments your dress code at school and
give this video a thumbs up if you
enjoyed it let me know also what other
videos you'd like to see after back
after my back to school series is done I

share it you guys like I'm literally I
hate when youtubers do this thing like I
know something and I want to tell you

excited by the way I'm adding a question
