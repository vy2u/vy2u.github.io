today's video because not only has it
been super requested but I'm really
excited to show you like a different
kind of way to curl my hair I've done so
many different tutorials on like ways to
curl your hair but I've never done
something like this so now that school
has started back a lot of you guys are
wanting to do different kinds of
hairstyles to kind of spice up your
routine and look a little bit I think
I've come across like the best way and
the fastest way to do your hair I know
that doing something fast in the morning
it's very important for you guys
especially because all those minutes
count in the morning about sleeping in
you don't want to get up early I'm
pretty sure I found something that is
like my favorite way to do it this wand
is by new me
I wanted something that was gonna be
like quick and easy and I never used a
curling wand before and in my I think it
was my like beachy waves tutorial a lot
of you guys were telling me that I was
using the curler with a club and you
were saying that if you were to use a
curling wand that is like no cloud for
anything like this it's super quick and
I was just kind of like in whatever you
know I don't really I don't really buy
into that kind of stuff because I always
just thought that I could just use the
cheap stuff from the drugstore and I
didn't really care but then I was like
you know what I might as well just try
it out and I have to say that like this
one really does make a difference it's
really good the whole point about a
curling wand without a clamp is that
it's supposed to curl your hair very
quickly but it also means that you have
to be very careful with it because it
gets extremely hot it's titanium barrel
so it curls your hair very quickly it
keeps your hair super shiny it lasts for
days I'm not even kidding you like if
you guys don't want to wash your hair
off in like youth
because it's pretty sweet this is not a
sponsored video guys I swear it's all
like my thoughts I love this wand it's
really good they have like all different
sizes too but I wanted something to give
more of a tight curl because for this
look I have I just want to do it so it
comes with a glove to protect your hand
because I have definitely hurt myself
before which is not good I burnt my
cheek and I burnt my hand so I just
figured I might as well use this which I
suggestible if you guys to takes like
not long to heat up so I'm just gonna
turn it on right now and I put it to the
hottest heating setting which probably
isn't the best but you know me I just
horrible
first things first heat protectant spray
my good old friend Trezza Mae this is
the one with the keratin smooth I used
to use the black one but I just bought
the red one because it was red and
pretty and actually liked this one a lot
better so then I spray my ends because
they're very dead after I spray it I
just brushed my hair starting from the
bottom working my way up to the roots
so for those of you who actually don't
want to be using heat like yeah I don't
really like using heat that often you
could use my no heat hair style but that
does take a long time so for a quick
alternative this is very very similar
curls to that that I showed you it's
like actually almost identical and also
with this wine what I realize is that it
doesn't damage your hair B so then I
just start off with any section I guess
I just do my bangs cuz I always do this
first but this one you have to be
careful because it is very hot it's
titanium like I said before so you don't
want to be burning yourself and you
don't want to keep this on your hair
that long because then you'll end up
breaking up your hair like that girl in
that video on YouTube I don't know if
you guys have heard about that video but
member she curled her hair and in her
whole like hair broke off the whole
piece because she looked at talk too
long so I would say like 5 to 10 seconds
so I twist around the barrel like this I
keep kind of a big gap between all of
them and then I just drop it and there
you got a curl also if you could tell
see how this piece here at the end is
more straight I don't like to curl the
whole section around so that the curl
ends in a curl I like to end it more in
like a straight thing I don't know why I
think that started when I used to watch
the like mary-kate and Ashley show
because they always have their hair like
that but that's just the look I like
better you guys can do what you prefer
but I just like to leave it like this
the great thing about this wand is that
since the way it heats up your curl your
hair will actually hold the curls for
like I I would say maximum of 4 days I
wash my hair like every 4 days around
sometimes 5 depending is a lot of dry
shampoo pros asking I really like the
bumble and bumble one right now it's
like the powder it's really good but
yeah I'll use like dry shampoo but the
curls were literally stay like they
don't budge I just realized that I put
on the wrong hat
my life literally my life big section of
hair twist it towards my face and when
it looks good about this love is that
you can actually like feel the pieces on
and make sure they're not like burning
up
can we crab holes so my whole head and
that's only two minutes I like to switch
up to pieces and sometimes I'll go away
from my face sometimes I look towards my
face I make sure that the pieces around
my face here like the closest ones are
always going away because I just like
that windblown look but like all around
my head I just kind of twist them up
like I switch it up and then also
sometimes I'll make sure the piece is
flat when I go around the barrel like
this like I make sure it's not twisted
and there's a lot of space and then
sometimes I actually like to grab like a
let's see a bigger chunk and then I
actually like twist the hair as I'm
twisting it around the barrel if you
know what I mean so it's not flat and
actually gives a different curl and I
just find you to have like a bunch of
different curls in your hair it looks
very natural and like beachy and
different and that's just the look I
like you guys can do what you like if
you guys like your hair to be more
uniform I feel like it to be like less
tight you can use I know new me has like
so many different style wands they have
a bunch of different sizes and if you
guys are interested I have some coupon
codes for you and listed down below so
you can get discounts everything on the
site which is pretty sweet if you ask me
because sometimes wands can be pretty
expensive but literally took me five
minutes I'm not even kidding you like
that took me five minutes I should have
showed you the time before but I just
finger comb through my hair so I go
through like my
fringe and then I work all the way down
like that and then if I just want to
keep it like this I would probably just
add in some texturizing mousse or some
like sea salt spray like I normally do
and just leave it like that and go on
with my day
but if you want some ultimate hairstyles
I think that doing little things with
braids is really cute so like obviously
I guys I always show you guys braids for
like second day hair let's say the next
day you want to switch it up you can put
throw your hair in a ponytail it's
really cute too because if you have it
in a side ponytail look at the curl
I don't if you guys could see that but
it's like it's super cute and it's very
beachy and the reason why I left like
straight pieces at the end just because
I wanted that more like beachy vibe or
it's kind of like messy hair but if you
like the curl going all the way around
to the end go for it it's all like based
off your opinion I would normally tuck
this behind my ear like that have it all
on one side and then I would quickly
just braid this so I would actually just
French read this so how you French braid
I'm sure many you've seen many tutorials
that goes on YouTube you basically just
like take the police that's closer to
your scalp like your forehead and then
you start braiding so I usually do one
whole braid first and then when you
start on the second braid the piece
that's closest to like the outer side
you're going to grab some extra hair end
and just add it on top read again grab a
section
and you can decide where you want to
stop and then I'll just lock it into
place like that so it looks like this
and then sometimes I'll bobby pin it in
and let this go over and then you would
just have this really cute like side
braid so there are so many different
hairstyles you can do with curls and
stuff I personally just like when my
hair is out like this I've showed you
guys so many tutorials of how to do
different kinds of braids and different
kinds of updo
so if you're interested in seeing any of
those tutorials that you can incorporate
with those these curls I will link them
down below
but for now I'm not going to get into
that because I've done those so many
times but I'm just gonna show you what
my favorite thing to do with these curls
are because it's quick it's easy and it
looks like you've taken it such a long
time to do it which is the best I'm just
using this texturizing cream from bumble
and bumble I picked it up the other day
and actually really freaking liked it
it's really cool it gives you like that
grungy kind of like dirty hook you know
what I mean
I read my between my hands and then I
kind of just put it into my hair like
this and I scrunch it
in all different ways
and because this wand is freakin an
awesome of keeping your curls in a lot
of times I noticed it like the one
insures that the curls don't fall out so
you can see the curls are still intact
like this it just look more like messy I
don't use that much I literally use like
you I'll show you I'll use this amount
we're like both sides so sometimes I'll
add it in a bit up here hope you guys
can see what I'm doing like so once
that's done I just go in with my trusty
sea salt spray from lush that I love so
much and I just add this to the ends of
my hair and scrunch up it and there you
have it some really cute like texturize
beachy curls I feel like I do very
similar curls all the time but I really
like this wand because of the way it
doesn't damage your hair and hold your
curls it actually makes your curls look
a lot shinier then you normal hair would
be which is pretty awesome you can see
in this video like how shiny it is it's
awesome because of the titanium barrel
and if you guys are interested I will
have a bunch of coupon codes for you
guys down below so the links will be
right there if you're interested in
getting a discount on the wand to have
or anything on the site I will have all
the information listed down below let me
know if you recreate this look at all
you can send me pictures on Twitter or
Instagram I would love to see them us
can direct message me I love looking
through my DMS Twitter is probably your
best bet but yeah so the main reason why
I like this is just because how quick it
was when you're in a rush for school but
you want to look like you were put
together and like somewhat nice even for
picture day this is like a perfect look
for picture day I would so do this for
picture day then
it's perfect for you because it's quick
it doesn't damage your hair it's awesome
it looks really similar to my no-heat
curls which is great I love that and I
hope you guys enjoy it so it just looks
like this it's really simple and I
really like it a lot just super messy
texturized also what you can do is like
tease your hair and stuff I just really
like it like this and yeah I hope you
