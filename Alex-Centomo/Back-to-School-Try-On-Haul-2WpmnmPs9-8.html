channel I first want to apologize if you
hear the shutter clicking sound there is
no one here to focus my camera right now
so we're just gonna have to make do so
although I am no longer in school I get
so many requests from you guys to do
back to school videos and to be
completely honest this time as much as
like most people hate it
I always liked going back to school in a
sense of going school supply shopping
and clothing shopping and getting a
whole bunch of new stuff it was just so
much fun for me and I always like to try
out the newest trends and stuff for
back-to-school so I figured I would help
you guys out with things I would
personally buy for back-to-school or
wear the school I went to didn't have a
uniform although we did have rules so
there were certain things we weren't
allowed to wear obviously every school
is different so if there are things I'm
showing that you can't wear to back to
school then there are always like
alternative options and I'll talk about
that as I show you guys the clothes
basically I did go shopping I picked out
things that I think will be perfect to
wear back to school but I do have more
things coming in the mail so I am
planning on doing a lookbook
incorporating some of these items but
also the other one so if you want to see
a haul part to let me know because there
are a lot of stuff coming in I'm going
to start off with ASOS a sauce how do
you pronounce it a sauce right okay so
with a sauce it has probably become one
of my favorite websites to shop off of
just because they do have a really good
price range so there's stuff you can
find very inexpensive and then there's
also more designer stuff and it's just
like a really good option plus they have
a tall section which I you know thank
you for because I am NOT like the
tallest person in five eight but I have
really long legs and enough fun things
fit me properly yes to that they have a
petite section and they have a
plus-sized section so they just a really
really good website the first thing I
picked up which I thought was really
cool is this like muscle slash tank top
it's cream nose hot cream it's like an
off-white color
and as you can see here there are just
like these trims but what's really cool
about them is that they're actually
like sequins sparkly it's almost not
noticeable unless you're looking
straight up or if you have it on but or
if you're like holding it but it's
really cool and I thought this would be
perfect for layering because I like the
striped look for back-to-school or just
any school in general and I thought this
would be super cute under a denim jacket
and also if you were to wear like
leggings or if you were to wear black
jeans I think that would be really cool
with some sneakers or converse and yeah
I just really like layering so I thought
this is really cute and basic I've
always been a basic girl for back to
school
so next from a sauce is something else
with stripes and I am obsessed with this
so it's a long-sleeve t-shirt and it's a
cream and light gray color and has a bit
of a v-neck in the front but what I
really liked about it was how oversized
it was and comfy on the arms so being an
athlete I do have bigger arms because
muscle and training and all that so I
feel very uncomfortable when I'm very
restricted like clothing is tight on me
at school so I like things that are a
bit looser plus I find them a lot
flattering a lot more flattering this is
something I thought was so cute and this
I know where I live it's still very hot
back to school and we're allowed to wear
short so I thought this is a jean shorts
would be so cute and just some high-end
sneakers or bands and I even this with a
baseball cap I wasn't allowed to wear
baseball caps in school but like leaving
school it would be really cute with your
hair in a ponytail plus it's good um
when you're inside and there's AC to
like you're wearing shorts but wearing a
t-shirt I'd always be kind of cold so
this would be perfect and then another
piece for layering is this cardigan from
a sauce and it looks like this is cream
with the black stripes I'm telling you
guys I'm loving it stripes so it's kind
of hard to show you what it looks like
but you'll see what it looks like on and
at the bottom there's like the black
stripes as well
on the sleeves here and this just like
super oversized
comfy cardigan sweater and I really like
it a lot
we cute it like any kind of football
game or activity you're doing where you
need to kind of layer up I think it
would be super cute plus I just have
this thing lately where I kind of like
have it off my shoulder a little bit so
if I'm wearing this cardigan I'll have
it hanging off my shoulder because in
school I wasn't really loud for
spaghetti straps but you could
definitely get away with where I'm like
still showing your shoulders and I think
it's just really flattering to have the
sweater kind of like hanging off your
shoulder I just think it's cute
okay so that's everything from a sauce
then onto windsor so I got two things
from Windsor that I thought would be
perfect for back-to-school and the first
one being this green cropped ish sweater
so this is a bit like bagger and loser
has a really cool material actually
super soft but it's not like a I
honestly don't know explain it but I
thought the color was really cute
especially cuz I have green eyes this
color just was really flattering on me
and because it's a little bit more
cropped I would definitely say wear
something high waisted so either
high-waisted jeans or high-waisted
shorts whichever one you are allowed or
even though high-waisted skirt would be
really cute but I personally probably
wear this with mom jeans that are high
waisted and have a little bit of rips
around the knees and probably like just
a plain damn color like the blue ones
and converse I think this would be so
cute so I really like the look of this
at school with some long jeans and then
the next type I got is more of a soft my
style but I thought it was really cute
so it is this button-down shirt and I
would have this tucked in to kind of
boyfriend jeans so something a bit more
bad year and lower or boyfriend jean
shorts and then I would have the buttons
kind of open here not so far down
because that's a little bit
inappropriate for school but just a
little bit and then you can like layer
some necklaces and stuff if I thought
it'd be super cute it's really
lightweight which is perfect because
when you're sweating you know it's just
really annoying
it's kind of like a men's look for a
woman which i think is perfect cuz I
love dressing like a boy also one thing
I just want to say it really bothers me
that there's like men's fashion and
women's fashion like obviously some
things were like made for men and made
for women but why can't any gender wear
anything like what what's wrong with
that like why can't I wear boy clothes
why can't guys wear girl clothes like I
mean I know a lot of people do but just
personally I think there's no problem
with that and it should not be based on
gender what you wear just the fine so I
got one thing from Urban Outfitters and
it is just a classic oversized sweater
from champion you guys know I love
oversized sweaters guess what it's gray
it's like gray oh my gosh what a
surprise but it's massive so this is
from the men's section and this is his
size extra large so this is super baggy
and so cute this with leggings and
sneakers yes and like your hair in those
um tight to Dutch braids yes something
I'm loving and it's really comfy it's so
soft and so warm and then just to give
you an example of something I would wear
with the sweater are some kind of really
cute leggings I got these from Hollister
and they're just black but they have
really cute mesh cutouts on the side so
can you even see that probably not I
don't know just like a mesh cutout and I
think they're super flattering these
jungle all the way down I have some from
allo yoga that go all the way down to my
ankles these are more like mid calf but
it's still really cute to wear with an
oversized sweater because it covers the
butt so it's not that not that leggings
are inappropriate but some schools don't
really like them so that's a good
alternative to wear with leggings is
super oversized sweater and then the
last thing I'm going to show you guys
are things I picked up from Free People
now this is more on the pricier side but
like I said I like to give a range so
I'm going to show you things I picked up
from Free People that I thought would be
perfect for back-to-school first being
this
cute sweater I say cute way too much
this really nice sweater from Free
People I just thought it was awesome
because of the cut and also the colors
this just reminds me of something that
my uncle would have worn back in the day
because he has so many different crazy
sweaters like this also what's really
cool is on the sleeve here there's like
a little um what does this call patch oh
no I thought this was awesome it's not
cropped it goes right down to where you
would have like normal jeans so it's
perfect but it's really lightweight and
so soft and so flimsy and the colors
were just so nice
what's a cute it's really hard I say
cute and like a lot next thing is this
cardigan and it's such an amazing color
guys look at this
this is so cute haha I have been looking
around for a sweater or cardigan that's
super baggy and oversized and has like
massive arms butts a little cropped that
I could wear open with like a black tank
top and high-waisted mom jeans and
sneakers and this one was just perfect
it's on the website and I had a hood
plus I'm like a really big obsession of
this color lately it's like screams fall
to me so this is I think my favorite
thing that I own right now love it so
much and the last thing I got is
something that I'm actually gonna be
sharing with my mom because we just love
these kinds of tops is a super oversized
boyfriend hoodie that you could
basically wear as a dress because it
goes down to like almost my knees but it
looks like this has really cool colors
and like blocked cutouts really
oversized and it says 92 on it which I
don't know why so this is the last item
obviously I wouldn't wear this as a
dress to school because that would be a
little inappropriate but I would
definitely wear it with leggings not
jeans I think it would just be too much
with jeans but definitely some really
like light weight leggings I have some
from Under Armour that are very thin and
I think would be perfect with this
sweater
um I mean but if you're just on the
weekends or whatever going to the beach
or going to like a little park with
friends for picnic or by the water or
something this with
literally just spandex shorts underneath
in case you you know bend over and you
don't want people to see you but um but
like no like just bare legs and sneakers
would be you so this is gonna be my new
word for cute this I just I'm really
happy with it oh and the hood is really
oversized too which is cool it's really
awesome colors so that's everything I
got for back-to-school based off my
style and the weather here in Montreal
also really curious to know what your
uniform is like do you guys have a
uniform or do you have a strict dress
code I'm so curious cuz my school I feel
like was very very laid-back with that
kind of stuff like there was no dress
code there was no uniform the only thing
you couldn't wear I was like booty
shorts which I mean that kind of makes
sense but other than that you were free
to wear whatever you wanted to wear and
also let me know if you want to see a
part two or if you just rather see the
stuff incorporated into the lookbook
because obviously I always leave links
down below I will leave links for
everything unless I absolutely cannot
find it I will leave a similar one and
yeah I hope you guys enjoy your day let
me know when you go back to school
because I'm just curious to know and
what grade you're in or if you're in
university or college or stage up or
high school whatever you're in and I
love you guys all so much and I'll see
you guys in the next video bye
let you go let me down
don't you give up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
