with another hair tutorial video I have
been getting a lot of requests to do
another hair tutorial video and I get a
lot of questions in my Instagram
pictures of how I do my hair but I've
already actually made a tutorial on how
I usually do my my loose curls so I will
link that right here so yeah a lot of
people ask me how I like to maintain my
curls because I don't wash my hair that
often I've washed my hair maybe like
twice or once a week just because that
is how I'm growing my hair I find that
washing my hair just causes it to be
more greasy and then it's really dry and
I find personally for me the less I wash
my hair the faster it grows and the less
greasy it gets actually I can go like 5
days now my hair doesn't look greasy and
that's pretty cool but doesn't mean I
don't shower a lot of people are like oh
you're so gross you don't wash your hair
it's like well I still shower every day
I just don't wash my hair anyways today
I figured that I would show you guys how
to do my like beachy messy waves because
I've done like loose curls and then what
I like to instead of like redoing this
the curls every single day so I don't
like to apply heat on my curls every day
the second day is still like the curls
are still nice as you can see but by the
third day they're kind of like flattened
out and like gross so then I like to do
this step to ensure that my hair still
looks nice but it's really cool it's
like beachy messy very like bohemian and
sometimes I'll add in a couple braids or
whatever you know make it cool making
you need to make it what you like and
I'm just gonna show you guys what I like
to do after a couple days of not washing
my hair before I get started I just want
to mention that this top that I'm
wearing is from fresh tops I absolutely
love their clothes I've just been
obsessed with them lately
I'm a really big fan of graphic tees and
they have like the best graphic tees
they're so funny
they're so trendy I see them all over
tumblr and like I've just been obsessed
with tumblr lately so it's just like I
need to have those tops so that is why I
have this one this one's just really
funny it says I ship us and if you don't
know it means it means when you
like ship to like people together like
that you want to be in a relationship
so like if you see them like through
YouTube or through like a TV show or
something and you're like you want them
to date so you ship them together so
anyways I just think it's cool so yeah
if you want to check out the tops I will
link they website down below as well as
right here and seriously guys go check
them out they're so funny the tea's I
also have the one that says lol you're
not Harry Styles they're just a bunch of
really cool tumblr kind of t-shirts tank
tops crop tops just really unique so
yeah I definitely go check them out and
let me know in the comments below if you
did and if you love their teens because
like I'm a huge fan and I'm making all
my friends become huge fans so without
further ado let's just get into this
tutorial because I just feel like I'm
gonna be talking forever that just gets
boring let's be honest okay so um let's
just throw that back by the way I need
to look into the viewfinder like this
thing right here this is second day hair
right now as you can see it's just like
kind of flat and like boring whatever I
would still kind of wear this around but
I'm gonna show you guys what I do like
on the third or fourth day if I don't
feel like putting in a braid so I use
curling iron this is a what like a two
inch curling iron from Conair I just got
this at like the drugstore it was pretty
cheap and I find it works well so I
don't need any like fancy my
straightener and my curling iron or like
the cheap things and they work perfectly
fine for my hair so I mean if you want
to spend all that money good for you but
like so first things first make sure you
spray some heat protectant spray on your
hair because you don't want it to damage
your hair because you know putting heat
always damages the her I got some of
them oh oh oh it's you so bad so yeah I
just wait everywhere and then of course
concentrate it on my tips for those of
you asking yes I do wear some extensions
on occasion to like make my hair more
like thicken it like voluminous and I
don't know I'm just like I have pretty
it fine and thin here so to make it look
like I have more hair I like to add some
extensions because my hair is thin and
don't ask me where I got them because I
honestly don't even know oh the first
thing that I do
is really simple this isn't to be a
really quick tutorial guys because
honestly like it's so simple just grab a
section I don't actually use the clamp
um I guess some people like that but I
don't so I'm just gonna be curling it
around the barrel but I like to keep it
flat on the barrel I don't know if you
guys know what I mean um I also don't
start high up on my roots I start kind
of like Midway and I don't keep it on
long like look seriously 1 2 3 and I let
it go in my hand let it cool for a sec
and then you got a little bouncy curl
and honestly like for this look I like
to keep the curls very messy and I don't
do my whole head I just do random
sections I don't have to be too perfect
because this is like a second day look
hair so I don't want to add too much
heat on it I'm just gonna do my bangs I
want you guys to be able to see what I'm
doing so remember always curl away from
your face seriously when you curl
towards your face is so unflattering
just don't do it no matter who tells you
what I just think it's like one of the
most unflattering things you do that
sounds so mean I take that back I'm not
a mean person what am I even saying guys
like you really have to believe me when
I say like I'm not a hairdresser I
honestly people think I'm insane like I
do such good hair styles but I just go
on YouTube and I search up things and
then I try it out and that's how I
learned let's just do the little pieces
that surround my face
see how it's just very like loose the
longer you keep it on the tighter the
curl will be so unless you have like
really straight hair that doesn't curl
easy maybe keep it on a bit longer but
to be honest like my my hair curls very
very easily so I don't need to keep it
on that long
so you guys see I twisted it around the
barrel like this they're all the pieces
are flat and I'm just kind of holding it
with a clamp open and then for a few
seconds then I drop it into my hand like
that let it cool for around five to ten
seconds and then you just let it like
fall I think that's about all I'm gonna
do I don't like to do that many pieces
because this is second day here so I
still kind of have a curl if you are
curious to see how I normally did the
curls beforehand I will link the video
down below so you can just click it
it'll be like the first link right there
I'm just so you guys can see how I've
done it before so then you can see the
rest now on to the cool part if you have
hair that doesn't hold curls for very
long this is the part where you need to
add some hairspray but since my hair
like fortunately for me like hold curls
for so long and I don't know why I guess
maybe because I haven't actually wavy
hair but I never ever use hairspray and
it just holds really well so I'm just
gonna skip that step so if you're like
me go ahead and skip it if you're not
use some hairspray and then you go on to
some sea salt spray so this is the sea
salt spray from lush I just find this is
my favorite sea salt spray um I don't
know it smells really good it like loose
my hair looking the nicest and I just
really really like it a lot I've tried
different ones but I always come back to
this one so I'm definitely recommending
the one from lush um so yeah sometimes I
will just spray this in my hair when
it's damp after I get out of shower and
it gives it like that beachy messy like
wavy look like very like as if you
braided your hair this is very gonna
this is gonna be very like beachy curls
so just go ahead spray this oh my gosh
this smells so good
scrunch it through your hair okay let's
just do this
so see how this side has all this like
texture going on right now the sides
very smooth I like to like mess it up a
little bit run your fingers through it
you could leave it like this or you
could do something pretty cool which I'm
going to show you how to do um I don't
know what this is called I saw it on
Pinterest and on tumblr and I just
recreated it so don't ask me what's call
it because I honestly don't know let's
just keep a section of hair out like one
and then grab a section here and then
what you're gonna do is you're gonna
braid this section so just a normal
braid I like to cross over the middle
one for this kind of thing make sure
you're braiding away from your face
you're going to pull on one section like
here like keep one so the middle one
you're gonna keep down and the other
ones you're just gonna you're gonna push
them up like this to see what that looks
like so this is actually called a snake
bite braid I just looked it up so then
you can like clip it behind which I need
bobby pins form hold on I'm going to do
the same to the other side
push them up so it looks kind of like
that and then you just connect it again
in the back and be like a little
fishtail braid down the center bohemian
and beachy so I apologize if you don't
find this video very helpful this is
just kind of just like what I do on like
second day hair third day hair I get a
lot of questions in my Instagram
pictures of how I like maintain my curls
or whatever and this is just one of the
ideas that I just really like doing
other than like the fishtail and like
the five strand braid or the regular
braid which I've also done a video on
that before you can search in my channel
or I leave a link down below but
basically like you can just make it your
own so right now I just have messy
beachy waves they're super textured so
it's like it feels really cool it smells
so good because of that sea salt spray
and then I probably go ahead and add a
couple like small little braids here and
there maybe like a twisting flower head
piece you know or you can have like a
chain like around your head make it very
bohemian and stuff but this is just like
really what I like to do I hope you guys
are all having a wonderful day don't
forget to give this video I just done
the British don't forget to give this
video oh god I'm sorry for British and I
just butcher your accent so don't forget
to give this video a big thumbs up to
