from the mall and the last couple times
i was there i purchased a lot of stuff
from lush and then i just use it all up
so i figured that this time i would show
you what i got before i used it because
i just can't control myself I'm just
obsessed with that store and the product
so yeah let's just get right into it
because I did get quite a few things so
let's get started I got quite a few
things I'm actually not as much as some
people get here on YouTube that's a
little crazy I don't have that much
money to spend but these are just a few
of my favorites that I picked up and
then i'm going to show you already said
that but anyways let's start off with my
favorite product from lush at the moment
and it is this bath bomb called cinders
it smells so good it's very citrusy and
and like cinnamony that's a word but
it's like citrus add cinnamon and they
have these like little candies like
sparkling crackling candies that like
explode in your bath mmm it smells so
good it's really relaxing and I like to
use this before i go to bed so basically
you just plop this into your bath and
then it just bums up and the oils in it
are really soothing on your skin I feel
it the next morning when I wake up my
skin feels really really soft and I just
really like these products battery so i
think i'm going through like three of
you so far and definitely will not be
the last one i'll be purchasing and i'm
probably be using this tonight so yes
which is the next one
Oh father Christmas it's this creepy
little man and kind of scary at the same
time but I really like the scent of this
it's some like citrusy and fruity and
just really fun and this is supposed to
linger on your skin the keeper skin
really really soft and the scent is
supposed to linger on your skin all day
so I'm going to try this in the morning
and supposedly this turns bright green
when you put in your bath so that should
be fun because it does not look anything
green right now I don't know if it's
picking up on camera but it's pink and
then white I really like that so mmm
that's so good nice i choose a wow
that's heavy the only sucky thing about
the big bath bombs is that they're gone
after one use of this kind of stuff
which is next little melted snowmen ah
look at him he's so cute I think he's
cute I'm gonna name him melty this one
is the bath melt so it's a bit different
um it's kind of like a hardened butter
if you want to say that I'm not really
sure what the ingredients are or
anything like that all I know is that
you put this in your bath and instead of
a bath bomb where it just caught up like
fizzes and explodes this one just melts
in your water bath melt melts in your
mouth and the oils in a really really
good for your skin just like anything in
lush is really good for your skin and I
really like the way he looks that's
mostly why I bought him mmm actually
like this the scent of this it's very
like it's like spicy and chocolatey I
don't know if that makes any sense but
mmm I like it a little bit minty too
that's a cool scent I like it I'm gonna
side to use I'm he's so cute it's
getting really dark I went shopping kind
of late so the sun's
I do not have my laning equipment so
bear with me ooh the next thing I have
is this twilight bath bomb like sweet
and musky and I love musty sense
especially when it's around this time of
year it's like getting cold outside and
I just really like that scent I normally
take baths more in the following two
anyways just because in the summer it's
too hot to like sit in a bath at least
for me mmm this smells so good I don't
know how to explain this it's just
basically like sweet and musky all in
one but it's not too sweet words
overpowering it's like the perfect
combination kind of smells a little bit
like lavender I smell that a little bit
but I'm it's supposed to be a relaxing
bath bomb so this just relaxes you
before you go to sleep and that's why
there's little like stars and stuff on
it and yeah this one is awesome this is
a bubble bar and it looks like this it's
called Christmas Eve and what you do
with this is instead of just like
popping it into your mouth you can
actually cut off sections and then you
crumble it in your hand as if you were
to like crumbled feta cheese or whatever
you crumble it under the running water
and it just creates so many bubbles
which I love like really really frothy
bubbles and I think it's a lot of fun so
the best way you can describe this is
this is like the most musky scent out of
all the things I own from lush um it's
very like mossy I don't know that sounds
appealing to you guys but it basically
smells like a really crisp winter's
night and you're getting all cozy before
you go to bed and it's called Christmas
Eve for a reason it's just like a
moonlight soak is what I'm gonna say mmm
I really really like this one it's a
citrusy and musky that's what I'm going
to say I like it and it has a little
moon really cute this next one is for
people who don't mind getting messy in
the bath I know that might sound weird
because like you take about to clean
yourself but I personally take backs to
relax I shower to clean myself so this
one is
is its melting oh boy it's a bath melt
and it looks like this it's very very
sparkly and shimmering mmm that's so
citrusy oh my gosh it smells good and
this is supposed to actually turn your
bath turquoise so that's really exciting
and yeah um no it's getting all over me
oh gosh do you see that this one is
called star light star bright I'm going
to just keep it in the packaging because
it's just like melting all over the
place and basically like the melting
snowman you just plop it in your bath
and it melts and really soothes your
skin and hydrates it and I'm excited to
use this because it smells very citrusy
and that is a smell that I really really
like especially when it lingers on your
skin I just find the smell of like
oranges on my hands or something after a
pill and you just smell so good so I
don't know if that's just me but that's
what i like and anxieties it so I bright
tuned to my camera just because it's
getting pretty dark outside um the sun's
almost gone and the last thing i got is
basically just a sample it's called the
super bomb for your hair so they came in
like a little package like this and it's
basically just like a greenish bluish
color um it feels like a lip balm so
when you put your finger in it feels
like a lip balm but what you're actually
supposed to do is you take a small
amount probably around a dime size and
you rub it between your fingers like
this and it gets very oily and I use it
for my scalp because this might be TMI
but my scalp gets very dry and almost
like flaky in the winter it's really
gross I know um so I just got this
because supposed to really help with
that so you just massage it into your
scalp you try not to get it like through
your hair because it's for your scalp
itself it's like a balm for your scalp
so anywhere that it kind of just gets
itchy or irritated you rub it through
that around half an hour before you get
into the shower and then before I get
into the shower I run a bit of shampoo
through my hair when it's still dry just
to kind of break it up because this
product is kind of meant to stick to
your head so I don't want to be in my
hair and make it look greasy and
anything like that let it sit on your
scalp rinse it out really well and then
it's supposed to
really help with the dryness and also
not make your scalp look oily so I'm
excited to try this because it's
definitely something that I will
purchase if it works for me because um
yeah it's a little gross my scalp does
get pretty flaky so yeah as I was
leaving lush I decide to just pop into
bath and body works because they were
having their sale and I got the I got
two candles one of them i just gave to
my mom the other one is a really nice
scent um this one's called pine cone and
I know you might be thinking uh ooh pine
cone like what does it smell like birth
Oh No and it's very musky and like i
said before multiple times in the video
i like musky sense and it's very like
warming and musky and it just smells
really good so I'm excited to use this
because i like it a lot and when sweater
brother is done over there which i'm so
sad about because i loved that candle
I'm gonna have to use this one and then
go into my Christmas candles because
those just get me so excited for
Christmas and I just can't wait okay
guys I apologize for the super quick and
weird hall um I also apologize for look
like crap I'm sorry I just came back
from shopping and I also worked out this
morning and yeah that's about it so why
do I deal with my lights I put some
lights on my bed and also if you notice
my eyebrows um yeah I filled them and
really thick because I did a photo shoot
and it looks a little crazy on camera
