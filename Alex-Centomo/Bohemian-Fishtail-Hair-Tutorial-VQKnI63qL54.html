up in the air don't know why I'm doing
that
basically I have been getting this video
requested for the past eight months nine
months year I don't know I've been
getting this video requested it so often
and I did one last year like maybe over
a year ago I did a few braid tutorials
but I haven't done like a specific
fishtail braid tutorial and that is like
what I'm known for is like my huge
massive fishtail and I just figured that
there are so many tutorials out there on
YouTube that you guys could check out
that I didn't need to do it but I asked
you on Twitter the other day what video
you would like to see and I got an
overwhelming amount of requests to do
this tutorial so it's very simple very
easy this is exactly what I do for like
my pictures on Instagram where I show my
huge fishtail I know for some people
it's not the easiest thing but practice
makes perfect and I'm telling you the
more times you do this the better you'll
get so just that in mind okay so the
things you'll need for this tutorial is
hair on your head doesn't matter what
length I used to have super short hair
and I can still do it in up long hair
that's awesome - I actually use
extensions so these are the extensions I
use they're the 24 inch foxy locks
extensions I forget the exact color and
shade of these but I'll leave and listen
right here as well as down below the
link you guys could check out if you're
interested
these are just the ones that match my
hair perfectly for my fishtail braids I
love to have really long thick fishtail
braids even though my hair is quite long
already I like to add extra length and
extra fullness to get that like really
bohemian messy fishtail look so that's
what I do extensions are a huge part of
my fishtail braids and then as well as a
brush you can you
any brush you would like the full hair
this one is just from forever21
simple use a comb or brush and then of
course an elastic to secure the end of
your hair you can use a clear elastic if
you want like those little ones you get
at the dollar store or you can use these
ribbon ones which I really like I don't
remember where this one is from because
I got a long time ago and I have so many
of these but I know that like Urban
Outfitters sells them forever 21 sells
them pura vida' like so many places sell
them but I really like them because
they're super stretchy and they don't
leave any crease marks in your hair so
the first thing I like to do is clip in
my extensions I feel like I've done a
tutorial on this before and there's so
many out there the pack of foxy locks
comes with like a bunch of different
whether they Wes or whatever they're
called but I actually don't use all of
them for my hair because I don't want to
have like crazy thickness just a little
bit so I actually use three or four
pieces so today I'm going to use just
four so I have the two here I have three
twos and then one three starting off
with a smaller one I just literally lift
up all my hairs if I'm going to grab it
into a ponytail and I leave out like the
smallest little section here like I
don't know if you guys can see that it's
just at the base of my neck um I leave
up the smallest section it doesn't
matter if this is like a lot shorter
than your extensions because you're
going to braid it in so it's going to be
hidden and then I literally take the
extensions and just clip them behind my
head like that I just literally clip
them in and they're so simple they're
not uncomfortable they're really secure
and yeah then I do another section so
like an inch above that one I pull out
some more hair do the same thing clip it
in
and again and I do this all the way up
to like where the top of my ears are I
never go above because I have a kind of
thin hair I guess you could say so it
doesn't uh like hide the extensions very
well if I put them up high if you have
thicker hair totally go for it as you
can see I'm going like right above my
ears and that's the highest I'll go but
yeah like I was saying if you have thick
hair totally go for it and I'm so
jealous
once all the extensions are put in it
looks like this oh and I curled my hair
yesterday with just a normal curling lon
so it's just second day hair my
extensions our second day curls I
brushed them out I like to do my hair on
a side part so it doesn't have to be
perfect I just do that middle parts are
okay too but you know whatever you guys
don't have to worry about the pieces
around the side of your faces because
you'll pull that out after all you need
to do is you section your hair in two
pieces like this just literally two
pieces now normally a fishtail braid is
you go in towards the middle but the way
I've been doing it lately and the way
that all of you seem to really want to
know is like the inverted way so it's
literally just the opposite okay let's
call this side a and side B so I take a
small section from the inside of side a
and I wrap it around and connect it to
side B so you see what I did there I'll
do it from here but you don't want to
grab the section that you just pulled
over and pull that one over you want to
take it a small section from side B
bring it around and connect it
to section a so whatever section you
just brought over you just want to make
sure you're not pulling that piece over
this so you're just always grabbing
something from section a bring it around
and connecting it to Section B like this
and I kind of do this messily so I'll
take like different sized sections I'll
just grab a chunk
pull it over I connect it grab a chunk
hold it over and connect it now this
piece just automatically fell out just
could that always happens so it's
basically like going outwards
when your braid is completely done you
want to secure it with your elastic so
whichever elastic you decide to use just
wrap it around and then I like to pull
my fishtail apart to make it look super
messy so I start from the base I kind of
just go crazy with it and I literally
pull out sections like this
as you can see I'm just gently tugging
at the hair if any pieces like come out
too much like that you can pull them
from the opposite side to make them even
or just tuck them underneath but the
Messier the better in my opinion and
then I just kind of like pull out some
strands and make it look super messy
like this and that is basically how I do
my huge fishtail braid extensions
definitely help with the thickness and
you can really pull them and kind of
make them however thick you want I also
had to play up with my fishtail braid
sometimes I'll do them like the inverted
way and then the other way and then
sometimes I'll like put like a small
regular braid in the center which you
literally just take a piece of your hair
and braid it down and secure it with
this one if you have any other
suggestions for hair tutorials you'd
like to see with me using my extensions
or without my extensions let me know in
the comments down below because I love
doing hair toriel's for you even though
this one's like super short it like
takes no time at all and I find it just
looks super cool with any kind of outfit
