channel I have not done a peer video and
I realized a really really really long
time and you guys know that that's kind
of how my channel started with doing
hair tutorials and hair videos and I've
been getting so many requests from you
guys so I was kind of like figuring out
which styles I should do because I feel
like I've done everything but lately on
like Pinterest and Tumblr and Instagram
I've been seeing girls wear their hair
certain ways I think they're really cute
they're really easy to do obviously you
could do them heatless in curly hair if
you want beforehand it's all - I prefer
Caitlin's could you guys know I don't
usually put heat in my hair I also just
dye my hair yesterday that's why it
looks like this I think the first thing
was starting off with any kind of hair
style is make sure you have a good base
routine with hair care so that comes
down to shampoo conditioner the types to
use any treatment afterwards obviously
if you're going to be using heat in your
hair you wanna use heat protectant my
holy grail right now is Giza
you guys know talked about this before
but this product is a lifesaver for my
hair like honestly it's the reason why
my hair is so like full of life lately
and feels so smooth and is shiny and all
that stuff is because of this um not
sponsored literally I just I love Megan
you guys know I'm a huge fan she's
awesome and this is her product and it
is a honey infused hair oil it's amazing
it smells great saved my life so I put
this in anytime I've you any kind of
style to my hair like afterwards I throw
a little bit into the palm of my hands
and then I just kind of gently bring it
from like this down that's like the only
thing I do other than wash my hair and
one so I'll use a purple shampoo to keep
it looking like this onto the hairstyle
so some of you guys might think like
Alex this is so easy and so useless like
why are you showing this to us because I
get so many questions about how are you
in here so this is it lately I've been
doing this hairstyle that I did when I
was in like fifth grade where you do
like the little elastics just in the
front of your
so it looks like that I mean you guys
can totally do just the elastics but I
found this cliff
I thought about Free People but I'm sure
you can find them on Amazon or Ebay for
like five books there little butterfly
clips but I like these because they're
rose gold so I'm literally just oh yes
guys I feel like I'm in elementary
school again so believe it or not every
time I wear my hair like this I get so
many compliments it's so weird because
it's like what was my um my hair in
fifth grade when I was so little but I
think a really cool way to play off this
is to do like little brave you can do
kind of like ponytails down here make it
kind of like looser and lower around
here that way because this is kind of
like tighter so I'm like flat so you
don't want to be like tight as well as
it's been I mean you can if you want but
I just think doing simple braids like
this you go like really loose with it
like don't hold tight and I always go
under the middle strand I don't know why
it's just like I haven't grabbed a clear
elastic or an elastic that matches your
hair color exits are clear because
nothing matches my hair color and then
just have fun with pulling it out making
it super loose and messy comes up and
you can even have a little strong kind
of hanging out so here better sense of
it I just think then this self yes and
it's like what I was one oh I don't know
why I'm just screaming at us but you
asked for it third first here 5 second
hairstyle from Alex it's all good it's
all good
or you can just leave your hero yeah if
you want I'll leave a link down below
for these clips that you want these
exact ones but even just like using
clear elastics for like just tying you
literally take a small front section as
if you're going to start a French braid
and then you just tie it not really
tight kind of a little bit more gallant
I
I'm not gonna tie it tight but you know
just so you get the point
then you get this little like saying I'm
probably you know where my Heil as a
psycho cello another time that I've been
seeing kind of all over Instagram all
over Instagram all of our Pinterest like
any time I look up hairstyle ideas to
inspiration this is what I see it's like
Dutch braids that are that would go both
back like this into either two buns i
but like the rest of your hair is down
or two like ponytails or one ponytail
but a lot of times I see like two braids
so for this kind of hairstyle you're
going to want to kind of just section
off just the top of your hair the first
thing I always do is just grab a section
as if I'm going here I'll come closer I
grab a section as if I'm just going to
either put in a last degree do a French
braid normally split it into three and
then I start French braiding but I want
to stay close to my part so I'm going to
like French braid back this way but it's
not transferred it's a Dutch braid could
you go like underneath the middle strand
that's the only way I remember how to do
it you want to just keep grabbing pieces
and incorporating them into the braid
so it basically looks like this when
it's tight and then the rest is all kind
of hanging down so what I do is I take
my clear elastic from before and I just
tie it off then I gently pull out pieces
so you can get a better sense of what
that looks like and if you feel like a
lot of the pieces are kind of sticking
up and you don't like that look you can
totally pin them down I personally like
something that's really messy you guys
know so I keep it like that and I also
always make sure to keep a little bit in
front of my ears
because I don't like this look but again
personal preference up to you and then
you just do the same thing to the other
side
so once your hair is like this you can
decide what you want to do with it you
can either put it into one big pointy
tail like this and then this is what the
top looks like I would totally like go
in and mess it up pull some pieces out
to frame your face just add something a
little bit different to your average
Pony
and I like the idea of having two Dutch
braids I think that's awesome
and also if you want to make the braids
bigger totally do that all up to
personal preference or if you want to
just do french braids in off Dutch
braids so now I'm taking the hair down
again something I've been seeing is they
take the excess hair from the braid so
you wrap it around into a bun I'm just
going to use a butterfly clip for the
purpose of this video but typically I
use just like either bobby pins or a
clear hair elastic but I think
butterflies are cute like this whoa what
the heck is going on here you get this
cute bun
now this does look quite messy because
of the butterfly clips but keep in mind
with bobby pins they're going to look
real cute or just a clear elastic
anything that you can just position it
down the bun so awesome and you just
have the rest of your hair out and it
gives something a little different again
so cute so hard to see what I'm doing
when I don't have a mirror so I
apologize in advance if these look a
little bit crazy
hold it okay so doing the same thing
again with the braids Dutch braids this
time I want to continue all the way down
till the bottom of your head like top of
your neck
once you bottom you're going to secure
it with an elastic this hairstyle really
helps if you have dirtier hair or like
grease your hair obviously I just got
mine done yesterday so super soft and
smooth and not texturized but you can
always put a texturizing spray into it
but you get the idea it's the same thing
to the other side now
now if I had a mirror I think it'll to
see what this looks like but you're
going to take my word for it you get the
idea
looks cool I'll probably fix it for a
picture but this is what it looks like
when I plug through a mirror
even if you wanted to put it in a bun I
just kind of threw it up into a messy
bun I think it's really cute as well if
you gonna be so cute if you put some of
the butterfly clips like in the braid or
like if you have little fake flowers I
think that would be so cute
please stop saying the word cute it's
really annoying but I hope you guys
enjoyed this video I know they're super
simple and quick and easy but these are
likely hairstyles I've been loving
lately there won't be any more hairstyle
that you think haven't done my trial
before anything you'd like to see for
like summer or any kind of like a bend

leave it down below as well as any other
video suggestions I'm actually going to
Mexico for a magazine shoot again and
I'm going to be there when this video
goes up but if you want to see any types
of videos while I'm there I'm going to
try and bring my drone and my GoPro and
get some like really cool footage so
that'll be super fun and I also filmed
like how to pack for just carry on when
you're going on a trip if you guys are
interested in seeing that

easy but I get a lot of questions on to
