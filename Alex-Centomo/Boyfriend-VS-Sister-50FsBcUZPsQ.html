one okay something that we both know we
gotta think of a good one
when I was younger like I don't know or
tween like 13 14 ish and I was in
swimming
who made fun of me the most no it's
actually because I did not like girls I
thought all you had a girlfriend like
literally six months later yeah no like
I did I found most girls so annoying
when I was like a young young teenager
yes what I found
all girls annoying just because you guys
were like like you like hanging through
there like oh my god okay I just need to
say two stories one involving Daniel one
involving Kyla because if you don't know
Dan I actually grew up together we've
known each other since we were like
eight or nine so the first story I want
to talk about is Kyla and her best
friend stuff like grew up together
literally since they were born and once
I am at the pool they like decided to
carve her name at the bottom of the pool
the kyln swiss giants Krypton yeah they
scraped it and like obviously people saw
it and they were denying it and everyone
was like all the like baby like telling
my mom and mom it's like they would
never do anything like that
the funny part was that we actually
wrote stuff in Kyla forever and then
we're like no it wasn't like signing it
yeah yeah I'm almost like really like
she was defending them she's like they
would never do something like that I
know my daughter she would never do that
so then that day she went home is just
like Kyla did you do that like yeah
we're in step gotten so much trouble oh
my gosh me it's never bad yeah and then
Daniel used to come in to like us
summers we have like your your lane or
something in and we were like we're
something earlier in the day so there
wasn't as many people so everyone had
their own lane and he would swim under
into my lane to peek and then go back
into his Lane
in his pee and I was like why I hate
this guy so much but it goes away it
goes away right away so finally doesn't
no no the chlorine kills it right away
right away done like maybe two maybe two
seconds
why isn't I killed boogers boogers are
like a thing so on my 13th birthday I
had all my president Circle giving me
presents and if you guys don't know I
have like anxiety opening presents in
front of people like I don't like it so
I'm like dying opening everyone's
present and like not enjoying it and
then finally Kyla shows up with this
like ball of wrapping paper and she's
like I got you a present and I was like
because Kyla's never got me a present
and I got kids whenever I get a present
from Kyla was like my parents bought the
present just like she signed a card or
whatever so I was like mommy your own
president she's like yeah and so it's
actually excited to open it so it's like
oh my gosh this never happens I unwrap
it it's a ceramic duck from my house
literally a ceramic duck from my house
and it was such a good gift cuz I
thought maybe you never seemed opened up
but why would I like that I gotta play
with it cuz I'm sure we're thinking like
oh it looks expensive
