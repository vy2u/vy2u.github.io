channel festival season is on its way
here I have Coachella next week which is
actually this weekend for you guys I'm
so excited and I get so many questions
about festivals every single year
although I think festival season is
pretty much similar every year there are
definitely new trends things that I like
to explore different vibes I like to go
for so these are things that I'm
currently enjoying and hopefully I can
help you guys if you are planning on
going to a festival at all throughout
the next few months then maybe you can
get some inspiration from some of these
things these from some of these things
I'm also wearing a new lip color and I
have a feeling it's gonna get all over
my teeth so if I have lipstick on my
teeth please tell me
actually those stupid because I won't
see it until I'm editing this video so
I'm going to separate everything in
categories and then I'm going to explain
why I like them why I think they're on
trend this year and a lot of these
pieces are new so this is kind of like a
haul slash essentials type video because
I haven't shown you guys any of these
things and they are still available
online cuz I just bought them so I will
have everything linked down below as
well as my princess Polly code because
there are some things princess Polly and
I get so many questions about if I have
promo codes and stuff the first thing
I'm gonna start off with our tops
because tops I feel like is the most
important part to an outfit because you
can wear any type of bottom which ops
you are sure to go or skirt you can wear
an overall type thing but there are so
many types of tops and I have kind of a
specific style when it comes to how I
like to wear my tops doesn't make sense
what tops I like to wear anyways tube
tops are super in this this this season
I see them everywhere I got a bunch of
brandy I'm not like loving the way the
brandy ones fit on me I'm broader and
they are kind of like places that have
sizes in chios so I discovered this new
brand called oh mighty and they have
really cool graphic tops and body suits
in everything so I picked up this one
this does have a bad wear on it so for
all of you but young viewers I'm sorry
but it's really funny my tits are too
nice for my life
to be like this I thought it was funny
this is like a meme I'm pretty sure but
I see this all over tumblr like this
picture and I really liked this tube top
so I'm putting this link a category of
tops but they're not technically tops
there bro let's but I wear bra less as
tops at festivals because I think
they're really cute they obviously hold
everything there during the day
festivals are really hot I like to wear
as like little clothing as possible and
then I usually have something kind of
tied around my purse or my waist I could
throw on at night something like this
just a shawl and I typically go for
white because white just goes with
everything and it's super thin you can
tie it around things easily and it you
could just throw it around your
shoulders that night to keep yourself
warm for bra let's I have three
different options that I recently picked
up someone to talk to that talked to you
guys about them because they're all very
different this bra let that I got off
princess Polly is very similar to the
bralette that I wore last year and I
think it's really nice to have something
like lace that's a dark color with a
more like pretty white bottom and I
really like the look of this one my
nipples don't show through it but I
think it's just because it's black but I
also don't really mind and I got this in
a size 10 I don't know that is an
Australian size but it fits me perfectly
and I'm a bra size 34 C and I just
really love the way that black goes with
10 skin and because I blonde hair I find
it's a nice contrast but black in
general just looks good with everything
even if you wore a black relic with a
like mesh black kind of top and
high-waisted jeans shorts and any hair
color I think it would be super cute
it's basically a staple then if you want
to go for something less lacy this I saw
at Urban Outfitters and I thought it was
so cute I love this muted pink color and
I think this with a tan is so pretty
and I would suggest either black jean
shorts or blue jean shorts I wouldn't
wear this with like any kind of material
but Calvin Klein I saw so many girls
rocking Calvin Klein last year and
there's just so many more options this
year I just know that Calvin Klein is
going to be everywhere over festivals
this year I got this in a size medium I
believe no I got this in a size large
because the medium one didn't fit my
boobs crap you're like a fitter
to my body but not my boobs so I'd
rather it be a little loose here but
still like able to fit my boobs and then
another one that is more lacy but I have
an idea for this type of bra light so as
you can see the colors really pretty but
I thought you know those really cropped
white tanks that like almost show your
nipples to wear this underneath
something like that to have a little bit
of this lace poking out would be so
pretty and then you can have just like a
shawl thrown over and over Neath over
top and some really pretty like dainty
shorts
I would suggest white but I think that
would be so pretty with like crazy long
hair either braids or loose and curled
and I just have this vision in my mind I
don't own tank like that but I'm
probably gonna go to like a thrift store
and buy just like a super cheap tank and
like cut it's super super cropped so
that it's gonna like show this and I
might actually wear this on Coachella so
if I do you guys will see exactly what
I'm talking about and if I don't then
I'll definitely wear it this summer at
like Osheaga or something so you're
gonna see this outfit at some point and
I'm giving you guys a heads up so if you
want to like what is it what does that
people say caught my look I don't know
I'm too old for that on to crop tops so
I have three different crop tops that
are different in different ways the
first one being this this is actually a
tube top but it comes with straps that
you could take off I like it as a tube
top but it doesn't stay up like it
always falls down so I have to wear the
straps but these types of tops are so in
I see them everywhere on social media
and I just love this one because it's a
velvet material and it has little stars
on it look how cute this is from
princess Polly and I think this isn't a
size 10 again I don't know Australian to
North American sizes but I love it I'm
definitely gonna wear something like
this I think this would be cute with
high-waisted blue shorts and the white
shawl that I showed you kind of over
your shoulders by like hanging off your
shoulders you're just holding it like
that and having your hair kind of like
half up half down very very girly and
cute and a really big thick felt like a
black belt or something to kind of have
a bit of contrast between the pastel
colors and then the next hop is from
Windsor and this is a size medium and
actually fits really nicely so this is a
more
I like to think of it as a typical
festival top because I see these types
of tops everywhere but I loved the fact
that these you could tie on top I think
that look is so cute I have a crop top
like that firm revolve and I love the
look of the straps with the ties really
flattering on and you can adjust how
tight you want it to be and then the
back is very like stretchy so you don't
really have to worry about that I got a
size medium because I wasn't sure I was
gonna fit I could have probably gone
with a size small but having it look a
little big is better than having
something be way too tight then the next
hop isn't off the shoulder top and I've
shown this one before but I thought this
was gonna be a good example because I've
seen these tops everywhere so they're
just the cropped off the shoulder tops
so I'm trying to like make it look like
it's off the shoulders since we revolve
it's a size medium and I love the color
of this and I saw a lot of girls wearing
this in white last year and they were
wearing it with like a neck scarf and I
thought it was really pretty but I think
with a ton of chokers would be so nice
and really high high high waisted shorts
moving on to body suits I have two body
suits here the first one is from that
brand called almighty it's so cool this
is a body suit and it says written and
directed by Quentin Tarantino so I'm a
huge Tarantino fan like I love all his
movies Kill Bill was my favorite movie
as a teenager I know that's so weird but
like it was my favorite movie and the
fact that it's the same colors as her
jumpsuit just makes me so excited so
this would be really really awesome with
high-waisted black shorts and then like
really chunky booties not chunky like
combat boots and then the other one is
from Windsor and this is also a size and
medium and I love this cuz look again
the ties on top moving on to shorts
because I got a lot of questions about
my shorts I'm going to show you guys
what I'm thinking this year pattern
shorts these are cute they're from
Windsor size medium like I said this was
a white top like I showed you before
from Windsor it would be super cute when
you have a very patterned bottom you
want to have a simple top and I think
white would look better with this versus
black personally but I don't think black
would look bad I just liked the white
better as for white shorts these are
from princess Polly they're size medium
this looks like a wedding dress but
they're shorts
how nice are these like this you can
edge up there
would be so pretty even with a white
bralette or like a white crop oh my
goodness I love this and they have
pockets too which is really handy
because holding stuff in my hands
sometimes I like to have pockets then
jean shorts I'm probably gonna wear a
lot of blue this season and my favorite
thing to do are vintage or thrifted
shorts so these I got from Urban
Outfitters but they're like in the
thrifted section so you have to like try
on like 10 pairs of shorts before you
couldn't even find ones that fit and
these are vintage Levi's these were size
small but they fit like big so it was
weird but high-waisted really distressed
at the bottom they're a light color I am
so excited about this like you have no
idea these are really cute and in the
air other pair I got are wear size large
and so I'm gonna wear these like low
waisted like hanging low like Britney
Spears circa 2002
they're so cute this is so 90s though
like with the chain and I added the
chain this is actually from my IMG a
pants that I took off and I put them on
these shorts I think would be so cute
those are probably all the shorts I'm
bringing with me maybe a pair of black
jeans shorts but those are super old and
like whatever you seen those a ton of
times in my channel ok on to hats so
obviously a baseball cap but another hat
that is good is these types of hats
these are everywhere a drink cups full
season this is from lack of color and I
like lack of color and Brixton because
they have sizes so I typically got a
size small so I do have a smaller head
this was a romper would be really pretty
I don't have any rompers because I'm
personally not wearing any rockers for
festival season this year but people
always wear rompers and jumpsuits and
this always looks pretty with those
types of tops not tops rompers now on to
shoes this is a really long video guys
I'm sorry two types of shoes I like to
wear booties or sneakers booties you
cannot go wrong with Doc Martens classic
pair go with everything edge up an
outfit love it very comfortable second
pair I've worn these every single year
at Coachella and I'm bringing them again
so you won't be able to buy this exact
pair but something similar I'll probably
have a link down below they're like
western looking boots the heel is really
thick it's not that high and I like that
this is wide so your leg like it doesn't
rub against it they're so dirty they're
so worn but I'm obsessed with these
they're by the brand
Freebird by Steven but I
got them for Coachella 2015 so like that
was a long time ago and then asked for
sneakers where any kind of old sneakers
bands are super in I'm gonna see them
everywhere this year these are the
platform versions I got them off eBay
they were the kids size so they were
super cheap and then these are super in
and yes white sneakers are gonna get
dirty but these are already so dirty so
whatever throw the feel of ones that you
can get off urban bit of a platform
they're very 90s like my whole family
literally asked me if I'm a nurse off
duty I don't know if that's offensive
well like do nurses wear this type of
shoe and I think this would be cute with
like kind of high socks rolled down so
90s and then sunglasses what's very in
this year are these small oval
sunglasses that are kind of like worn
down like this again
very 90s so I have this pair from
princess Polly this pair also from
princess Polly this one's more like
intense one this pair is from Urban
Outfitters
and it's more of a turret what does it
called tortoise look all very similar
different options you can choose from
but I love these types of Sunny's hair
accessories we have these super like not
vintage but like old-school Clips you
know these ones that like to call them
banana clips is that what they're called
but holding your hair bag like this
would be so cute this reminds me again
of the 90s and then a bunch of
scrunchies this is from princess Polly
these are from Urban Outfitters
scrunchies all the way then I got this
off Windsor I didn't know what category
to put this just like a neck scarf and
it has these things I'd tangle belts in
bags belts chain belts all the rage
right now as you saw my shorts I had a
chain but these ones wrapped around your
your actual shorts would be so cute and
then you guys know fanny packs have made
a comeback and I'm not sad about it I
love fanny packs but this is like a mix
between a fanny pack and a belt so I
thought this would be super cute because
you could still fit your like Walt not
wallet but like your cards and your
important things in here and have it
just kind of wrapped around your body so
you can keep it safe and then if I'm not
wearing a fanny pack I'm gonna wear a
backpack and this is the last thing I'm
showing you this backpack it's small
it's cute color it's from brandy you
wear it kind of lower down on your body
but you can fit so much in here and it's
just so much easier being at so many
festivals
pass I've always hated having just like
a shoulder strap I liked having either a
backpack or now fanny pack is gonna be
key I'm very excited for that
that is everything I hope this can help
you I know I'm gonna get questions about
why I didn't try anything on but that's
because I'm probably gonna be shooting
in these things in LA so make sure
you're following me on instagram because
I will be posting all the pictures there
so you can see all my outfits on my body
and see how they look
I think I look sick going to you
honestly guys like as much as the
fashion is so much fun at festivals and
it's really cool to express yourself and
wear different fun things and take
pictures my biggest advice is to have
fun go with your girlfriends go with
your guy friends go find your favorite
artists listen to your favorite music
dance around be free music festivals are
not all about the fashion and actually
if they're not really anything about the
fashion fashion is fun to express
yourself but music festivals it's about
the music and I'm so excited so excited
for some of the music acts this year and
I've been getting a ton of questions and
I've seen them about questions comments
and I've seen those comments on my
videos about doing videos about bands
that I've seen at Coachella this year
who I love and who I'm excited about I
think who I'm most excited to see this
year is the war on drugs because Daniel
and I are obsessed give this video a
thumbs up if you enjoyed it if you want
to see a video from Coachella let me
know what type of video you want to see
if you want to see a lookbook if you
want to see a vlog style video where I
also talk about my music let me know I'm
open to whatever I love you guys so much
and I'll see you all in my next video
boom pin this abandoned amusement park
