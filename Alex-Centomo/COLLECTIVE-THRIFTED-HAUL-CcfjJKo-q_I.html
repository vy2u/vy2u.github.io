my channel I have been meaning to this
video for so long it has been probably a
year that I've been wanting to do this
and just never really got around to
filming it and I had this whole plan
because I was in LA and I was going to
do a video all about like how to go
thrifting and show you guys how I thrift
I am currently on a curb in Los Angeles
I'm just hanging out here with Kat she's
on the other side of the street boom
this car and I've been wanting to do
this video for so long I just never knew
like when to do it and it's been so cold
in Montreal that I'm like you know what
why don't I just do in LA cuz for one
it's one of my favorite places to go
thrifting and to the weather is amazing
so I feel like I can definitely walk
around a lot outside walk you guys
through how I go thrifting give you some
tips and tricks for example I'm wearing
this shirt right now which is thrifted
it's a vintage tommy shirt and one of my
favorite things about drifting is the
fact that everything is like obviously
very affordable well I guess it depends
where you go to but this stuff is worn
it has like a history to it I am
obviously very nostalgic if you guys
have been subscribed to me for a while
you guys know I'm like obsessed with
everything 80s and 90s the fashion then
was amazing and I just think it's so
much fun to like first of all go
shopping in a thrift store buying a
shirt for like five bucks and even
customizing it making it your own
and yeah so before we go into the store
I don't even know if I'm allowed to film
in there in like three different stores
I got in trouble for filming so couldn't
really do that and then I started
feeling really sick and I was like oh my
god it's just like not working out but I
thought you know what I might as well
just sit down and film this haul because
I have been a thrifting so much lately
and I get so many questions about it on
like you usually YouTube or Instagram
Twitter and I thought that I would I
would not only show you guys what I've
bought recently but also explain to you
how I go thrifting if you guys are new
here make sure to click that subscribe
button down below
and then also hit that Bell notification
button so that your post notifications
are turned on so that you never miss one
of my videos and you always are notified
when I upload and then give this video a
thumbs up if you guys want to see a kind
of thrifting lookbook or something like
that obviously with this kind of haul
because it is thrifted I don't really
think you can buy any of these pieces
anywhere but I'll just show you guys
what I got and kind of
I got them the story behind them and
everything like that
and I don't think I'll have time to film
a try on haul because I need to leave
for an appointment in literally 20
minutes and I also have to just start
uploading this I have this is my like
only day and Montreal before I leave
again for New York City and then I'm
gone again for like practically two
weeks so I really don't have much time I
hope you guys can understand I know like
you really haven't people don't do
tryout halls but follow me on Instagram
because I literally have showed every
single one of these items on Instagram
before worn on me so make sure you're
following me there so that you never
miss any pictures let's start off with
jackets because I get so many questions
about my jackets I have two that are
kind of old and I've shown them many
times on my youtube channel but I
figured I would just talk about them
quickly because I get so many questions
still to this day on my channel and as
well as on Instagram so I'll just
quickly talk about it but the first one
being this jacket this jacket I've had
now for two years I'd say and I got this
a thrift store in New York City called
the vintage twin and it's one of my
favorite thrift stores it is a old
aviation bomber jacket from World War
two it's like a legit one it has like
even the crest on it and everything so
this is a really cool jacket it is it's
super flimsy it's really old I love the
story behind this and I wear this all
the time I'm actually bringing with me
to New York so if you guys are wondering
where I got this I got it at the vintage
20 you guys are in the city make sure to
check it out there's a few different
locations and this was an awesome find
as for my other jacket it is just an
oversized denim jacket this one I
actually got believe it or not on ASOS
and Asus has a marketplace section to it
so it's all kind of like vintage stuff
and I actually got this I'd say summer
2016 so two years ago and I wore it a
ton and I still get questions about it
all the time because I travel with it
it's like my go-to plane outfit food you
know wanted to your toy they are the
easiest to pair with everything and I
love the oversize fit especially off the
shoulders okay now moving on to some
things I found when I was recently in LA
so I actually want to show you what I
got in LA last year because I have
questions about this shirt I have this
vintage cropped Rolling Stones t-shirt
looks like this I wore this to Coachella
last year and I got a ton of questions
about it no I did not buy it like this
it was just an oversized plain white
t-shirt that said the Rolling Stones on
it and I cut it up to be cropped as well
as a more scooped neckline and that's
one of my favorite things about
thrifting is that you'll buy a shirt for
like five bucks and then you can cut it
up and make it your own and it looks so
awesome especially vintage band tees
those are my favorite and yeah I get a
ton of questions of this still so it was
literally digging on the couch right now
wish you could see this I was in LA and
I was looking for a really good pair of
redone denim now redone denim is not
specifically thrifted it's usually like
Levi's or something that has been
reworked and made to look really cool so
it is more on the pricey side but I just
love redone denim it's like my favorite
type of denim because it's so flimsy
it's so comfortable but you have to try
on like a hundred pairs before you find
like the perfect one so I tried on so
many and I literally found the perfect
pair so they are high-waisted with
buttons and then they have a rip in the
knee and they're a little flared at the
bottom with some distressing but this
color is so nice so these are Levi's
they were originally you know typical
Levi's okay but this is the thing when I
buy jeans I can never find jeans that
fit my thighs in my butt as well as my
waist I always have to go like two sizes
up to be able to fit my butt and my
thighs but then it's so big on my waist
and it's always so frustrating but these
fit perfectly and I don't understand how
it's like magic jeans so I'm really
happy with the way these fit on me and
I'm so excited about them and they are
definitely my favorite I say thrifted
but they're not thrifted at all vintage
reworked jeans that I've ever owned in
my entire life and I'm so happy with
them then I went to waistline which if
you're from LA if you've been there you
know that it is just a vintage store on
Melrose one of them and it's one of my
favorites
because it has really good bad tees and
I
this one huge Pink Floyd fan dark side
the moon and I like that I had this
really awesome distressing to it it's
really soft it was in the men's section
and it's a really oversized fit but I'm
so happy with it
and I just love the color I've never
owned like a gray color like this you
guys now own a million grey things but
nothing like this so it's really happy
with it
originally I'm was gonna cut it up but I
kind of like it like this then in
Ireland I went thrift store shopping and
they actually had really good options
for thrifting there so I found two
t-shirts which were really affordable
the first one being this vintage Beatles
one it's just an over dad's home it
looks like this has the Beatles on it
behind in front of the American flag and
I loved the color of it they're all kind
of basic oversized tees those are my
favorite ones especially bad tees
because I could sleep with them I can
workout in them I can wear them out just
very versatile especially if the shirt
is super affordable and this isn't a
size extra large and it's a legit
Beatles top like it says the Beatles
here and then the other one I'm wearing
right now I also got in Ireland looks
like this super oversized it's blue and
it's just the boys on a t-shirt and I
love it yeah I just got those two shirts
and then also dad got this really
awesome like bomber jacket from one of
the stores and I steal all the time and
it's so comfortable and I think he got
it for like 20 bucks and it's like a
really well-made bomber jacket now there
are a few online shops other than the
ASOS marketplace which I do vintage
shopping on these are a little bit more
pricey because if you go to a local
thrift store you can literally find
shirts and stuff for five dollars which
I definitely recommend but sometimes I
go on these websites and I see something
and I'm like that is amazing and it's
like 30 bucks so it's not that bad Plus
this one website is based in Canada so
it's like really cheap shipping and
normally when I have to ship things it's
always international so have to be
customs and like shipping is so
expensive but this website if you guys
are from Canada it's so good I think
it's based out of Vancouver or BC I mean
they can do two-day shipping and it's
awesome but if you wanted to do standard
it's like super cheap and you'd get your
stuff in like a week so that is the one
good thing about this website I just got
years ago and I used to shop on it all
the time and then I started thrifting
more in person but then I've kind of
recently gone back on to it I'm like oh
this websites just so good yes there are
expensive items on it it was real
vintage stuff a lot of its reworked but
I still really love it so it is called
Frankie collective it is a Canadian
website and yeah if you guys are from
Canada definitely check it out I usually
buy more than one thing so that the
shipping even though it's cheap is still
worth it but I got a few things over the
course of like a few months and I'm
gonna show you guys but the artist the
first one being this vintage Gucci top
that was reworked to be crop it's so
cute I actually wear this horseback
riding and I know this sounds so like
bougie and like oh my god what are you
doing but it was so hot that day and I
had just gotten this in the mail and I
was like oh my gosh I'm gonna wear this
and it reminds me of my grandma's shirt
I know that sounds so weird but my
grandma has a Gucci shirt like this my
grandma's so classy she has everything
designer and she has a Gucci shirt like
this and it's so nice so obviously hers
is white and not cropped but I just
thought it was really cool and that one
is probably like I know it's expensive
for a crop top but I think it was like
40 bucks but 4 or 35 and that's Canadian
so that's cheaper American and I don't
know what conversion is from the rest of
the world but that's pretty good price
for a vintage Gucci top even though it
has been reworked then I got this Tommy
T and this is just oversized super baggy
Tommy tee I wore this in LA and I just
love the basic logo on it it's a little
bit more off-white and it does look a
bit stained but I kind of like that the
sleeves are long to kind of like this
which I like because I like when the
sleeves are long and what I really like
too is when I buy oversized shirts and
this is why a lot of times I buy men's
shirts is the seam like hangs over your
shoulders so it makes it look a lot
bigger and since I have broad shoulders
with all the times I hate when shirts
are like the seam is here and then like
my shoulders are bulging out of it so I
always look for shirts that have like
the seams really hanging off the
shoulder that's what I got with this as
well can almost wear this is like a
dress I mean my butt does hang out of it
but it's super long and comfy then I got
so many questions about this on
Instagram I got this cropped Nike
sweater and it is so comfortable oh my
god it's really cropped so I definitely
recommend wearing like a bra under it
they don't mind people seeing especially
if one is a bit longer so it Peaks out
but it's so nice this just gives me such
90s vibes and I love wearing it with the
jeans that I showed you guys from
earlier from bridge a denim and I love
it I wore this in LA when I took a
picture against a blue like vintage car
and it reminded me of the song by Billy
Joel
still rock and roll in me and I thought
it was so cool and I just really liked
it but I got so many questions about
this on that picture so yeah this is
from Frankie collective it sucks that
you like can't get the exact thing
because everything is just one of a kind
when it comes to thrifting or vintage
but they have a lot of similar stuff so
just make sure you're on it kind of
often I'm subscribed to their newsletter
so every time they put up new things I
get an email so I'm like first to check
because their stuff sells out really
quickly and you'll see if you go on the
website a lot of it says sold out but
they update their websites so often so
don't worry about that this is also not
sponsored they have no idea I mean I'm
even making this video I don't even
think they know who I am but I'm gonna
give them a huge shout out because
they're like awesome but again they're
not super cheap like if you were to just
go to your local thrift store if you
were traveling somewhere and you went
into a thrift store like that stuff is
really affordable and really awesome but
this is obviously more expensive but if
you're into Canada has cheap shipping
because it's from Canada then the last
two sweaters I'm gonna talk about
because I don't think I've mentioned
this one at least on Instagram before it
is a Nike crewneck sweater that does
have distressing on it and it's a really
awesome like khaki green color and I
love this color for spring I think it's
so nice especially if I have a tan and I
love wearing this with the sleeves
rolled up and I think it's a really nice
fit it's not very oversized like this
literally fits right at my waist but I
like that look especially with leggings
and I really like this color and greens
are so in this season so honestly greens
and reds I know that's like Christmas
sounding but Reds all the way even
though I have nothing right here and the
last thing is this green Nike oversized
sweater this one is very oversized like
I can wear this as a dress it covers my
butt and the sleeves are very like
oversized and big but this is like my
favorite color and I love the sweater
this is definitely my favorite sweater
that I own I bring it everywhere every
time I travel even if it's a beach
vacation I always bring a sweater with
me because I'm cold at some point
whether
on the plane or like at night this goes
everywhere with me and because it is
thrifted like the quality is I mean it's
from the 90s so you can't really let go
wrong with it it's been around forever
so I can you know mess it up as much as
I want and it's good and plus it really
brings out the green in my eyes so that
is it for this haul I hope you guys
enjoyed it again I'm so sorry it's not
trying to haul I know you guys get like
so frustrated when things aren't Tryon
but if you guys want me to make a
full-on like my go thrifting with you
guys and see if I can secretly film it
somehow like in the dressing room and
then show what everything looks like on
me please leave a comment down below
because I am traveling a lot and I will
be thrifting a lot so I do really want
to know what you guys think
or if you guys prefer like these
pictures or whatever let me know as well
because like the one thing with try and
hauls which I like is that if I wanted
to purchase the item I could see what it
looks like on the body type okay that
looks really good on them I'm gonna buy
that for myself too but since this is
drifted and you guys can't buy these
items obviously there's no point really
but I know what it's like to want to
watch a Tryon so I get it guys don't
worry I love you all so much new videos
coming very soon cuz really exciting
things are happening and I love you and
I see all Linux video bye also I
realized I was so far from the camera
this whole time and like soullow if you
guys want me to make a video all about
flail it's like music and stuff that I
love let me know because I'm into some
really good oldies and stuff and I make
really good playlist for myself so if
you guys are curious about that let me
know because music is huge in my life so
