channel I'm just shown here with my good
friend toothless and we were talking and
we decided that we were going to do a
haul today literally don't know why so
that just came out with us anyways I'm
not going to make this intro long
because my past for videos or what not
have been so randomly so let's just get
right into it so I went shopping at
three different places and I decided to
show you three items from each place
just to make it a lot more simple and
also I'm trying out this new Tryon
technique where I show you what the
outfit looks like in my mirror so
hopefully you guys like that if not if
you want me to go back to like the white
wall saying let me know in the comments
down below I thought I would try
something new first place I'm going to
start off with is brandy because you
guys all look brandy melville this is
the first piece there's a hair it's this
hat it's like a corduroy hat and this
color it looks oh it's you picking up on
camera it looks kind of grey let's like
a purplish gray like a dusty purple grey
oh great I don't know it's just really
nice I really like the style of hat and
it has with a more fluffy back part so
it's not too structured but then this
part is nice and structured whereas
they're old happy remember we're very
kind of flimsy I feel like it was kind
of best of both worlds so I really like
that
I lied already I said strands per thing
but it's going to be for Quran because
the Hat I didn't count the Hat but
whatever I thank all this knit like a
hoodie but it's cropped like that it's
really Q it's really oversized it's not
cropped to the point where it shows your
whole stomach like if you wear
high-waisted jeans it'll go over the top
of the jeans so it won't show anything
but I would recommend if you're going to
be wearing this to school to wear this
with high-waisted jeans or leggings that
go higher up the waist because it would
show a bit of your stomach but it's just
really soft it's a nice charcoal color
this is just perfect with literally blue
jeans sneakers and a hat like this just
loungewear even this with leggings and
white sneakers like you can't go wrong
with cropped hoodies I just think
they're like everything and especially
brand new ones they're so great the next
you talk to Randy are pretty similar I
wore one in the last video and in the
intro Naggar a lot of
about it so it looks like this it's a
light gray cropped 3/4 length sleeve top
and what's really nice about this is
like the top it kind of ruffles if you
can see and the sleeves are like that
too as well as the bottom and it really
reminds me of shirts I had when I was
back it really reminds me of sure if I
had when I was in elementary school
which is super strange but it's really
cute with chokers
I love these types of tops I find them
flattering on weeks that have broader
shoulders I know they look completely
different on girls with who have smaller
shoulders but they're still really
pretty so I got this one and then a
similar cut to that is this it just
doesn't have the ruffles but it's black
and white stripes and it's not
completely black I would say it's more
of an all-black looks almost Navy but
it's really cute I really like this
style top I find that really flattering
on me with high-waisted jeans and
sneakers or booties I think it's queue
of winning la next week actually and I
heard it's raining there or has been
raining there so I'm going to bring a
bunch of beads tall and just chill out
in them they're really comfy and casual
on to Windsor so you guys know I'm a
huge fan of Windsor been a huge fan for
since I started my channel basically and
they are on point with their basics
right now I have to say like anything
that comes out that's really trendy but
that's like very expensive they will
have an alternative for a much less
price lesser price it'll just be a lot
cheaper not in terms of quality so much
budgets in price so I know what these
tops right now first of all this color
is like to die for but these types of
sweaters that have the tie that goes all
the way down I see them all the time on
like revolve and stuff and I actually
have a sweater from a ball that's very
similar to this particular this color I
see it a lot and they range like 200 to
300 dollars is crazy so Windsor has this
one I took the price tag off but it's
probably around the $30.00 range
Canadian and it's really cute it's
cropped it's this beautiful color you
guys know I love this color so much and
you guys seem to be fond of it as well
and it's just a simple knit that has
ties going down
sighs literally with any type of genes
this would look so cute and if you guys
live in a warmer climate this with
shorts and booties yes then I got this
really cute knit again and it has this
really awesome detailing of these
stripes and it just reminds me of like
something I would have worn to school
back in the day but it's really comfy
and adds just a little bit of extra I
don't know details too at all it's black
and I really like it
so this one this is a size medium and
this was 20 to 90 so 22 bucks 23 bucks
whatever really good and by the way I
get all of like brownies one size
Windsor I typically get a small um I
typically get a medium or a large
depending on what the product is that's
just how they fit me and I don't like to
be restricted in my clothes I'd like
them to fit a little looser and then the
last thing from when here is very
similar to the hoodie I showed you from
brandy but it's this color so nice so
it's a cropped
hoodie but I mean cropped to like look
it looks like it's been cut like I love
that style when it comes to tops I just
think it's so nice this is a medium and
it was 2490 so I just really like this a
ton and guys by the way I'll have links
listed down below if you if you're
curious to check out any of these items
I'll put exact and it's the exact aren't
there also something super similar this
one is a little bit bigger than the
brand-new one as in it's more oversized
but it's cute ok the last few things are
from revolve the first one is this top
here this is a very similar color to the
sweater I showed you just more pink so
it's a long tunic looking t-shirt
naughty shirt shirt blouse whatever it's
from the brand Tularosa it's a size
large which is actually really big but I
wanted to wear this over a bikini and I
kind of like when these types of shirts
cover my buck so I could just walk
around them like as if they're dresses
when I'm going like from the hotel to
the beach I just think it's really
casual and comfy or also I could tuck it
into jeans
and have it be more of a dress up top I
don't know the price of this but as you
guys know revolve is more on the pricey
end so just beware when you go click on
the links the next thing is what I was
saying before how it's similar to the
Windsor one it's this cropped
cream knit that's like fuzzy you guys
could see this it's like super fuzzy I
really like the sides because look
they're open this is from the bread
mozzarel it's a size large but spits
honestly like a small or a medium it's
made kind of small but I don't know if
it's the material or what it just that's
just how it fits on me
I'm really soft really cute again with
jeans and booties and then if the jeans
had a belt on top because this is quite
crop so you would see the belt right
there really really lovely and of course
you add a bunch of chokers and you make
the outfit look amazing also if you
really cute over like a dress or skirt
kind of just like hanging on top and
then last but not least I have this the
brand lovers and friends size large
obviously I just love this detailing
here I think it's so pretty so this is
kind of like a ashy creamish creamish
and ashy cream look a grayish cream it's
not like any sense I mean you'll be able
to see it on the website better because
it's kind of being washed out from my
background but it's really cute I love
the details with it and I said is it for
my haul I hope you guys enjoyed it my
meal applied video is coming it's taking
a bit longer because I just want to make
sure I have always backed down before I
put out a video for you guys I don't
want to give any like wrong information
I know when it comes to food it's pretty
sensitive topic so I just want to make
sure that everything is good on my end
before I share with you guys and I love
you all so much don't forget that and
subscribe if you're not already you can
feel some up if you enjoyed it and I
will see you guys all in the next video
