kind of messy room right now you can't
really see that much but I literally
just went through my whole closet and
what like did kind of a big spring
cleaning thing now that it's March I
just feel like I need to go through
everything and just like get rid of a
bunch of stuff and also yes my hair is a
little crazy but I'm digging it I'm
sorry guys I'm gonna dig in this
hairstyle but before I get into anything
I just want to say thank you all so much
for 200,000 subscribers I can't believe
that we've reached this right now it's
crazy to me because when I first started
this channel I just did it for fun as a
hobby like all youtubers say but for
real i didn't even know that anyone
watched them i just did it for me so the
fact that you guys are all in this
journey with me means so much and stay
tuned for something coming soon for you
guys i wish i could tank every single
one of you individually but i can't i'm
gonna be doing something pretty exciting
so yeah keep your eyes peeled for that
because it's like spring cleaning and I
don't know I just I feel like every
single spring it's still snowing where I
live but every single spring I just feel
like I need to go through my wardrobe
and kind of just do like a hole and get
rid of everything and then I also
realize how disorganized I am and it's
just like it drives me crazy you guys if
you watch my blogging channel you will
know how disorganized my room could be
sometimes like especially when I'm
filming or taking pictures and just it
drives me crazy and I feel like a cat do
my work properly when my room is just in
utter chaos so I get a lot of requests
from you guys to do like a makeup
storage or a wardrobe storage and you
guys know I have a pretty small closet
but I have a ton of clothes and you
always ask me like where do you keep all
those clothes and where do you keep all
your makeup like I don't understand so I
someone that I I own a lot of makeup but
i don't use makeup everyday and what i
do use on days that i wear makeup isn't
that much so I have like my everyday
makeup bag and then I have everything
else kind of stored away in my cupboard
some stuff in just different bags and
everything and my everyday makeup bag i
keep on top
of my dresser whereas clothing wise this
is something that I have been struggling
with for the past few months as you guys
know that watch my blogs it's just like
I I have there's clothes everywhere
because I have a shopping addiction and
I don't know what to do myself I
actually found something that really
really helped me and I'm not just saying
that but like this actually saved my
life and I'm really excited to share it
with you guys especially since I've been
getting so many requests to do an
organization thing and I love watching
organization videos because for some
reason I don't know if it's like I have
OCD or something but I love when
everything is at its place and like I
know where everything is and I have
everything and it's just good so there's
this app that I found called snubs and i
actually discovered it on youtube
someone had made a video about it and I
was just like wait really what is this
it's actually really cool so I'll show
you in a bit like how to use it and
stuff but basically what it does is that
you can take pictures of anything you
want in your closet and your makeup your
shoes everything like that you take
pictures of them and you know what
pinterest or you have like you can make
pin boards and stuff and you can have
like wedding or room decor or you know
all that stuff any post pictures into
that this is like the same thing except
you couldn't you make shelves so each
shelf you have is like for me I did it
more for like fashion like I have a lot
of makeup stuff and I'm doing that too
but I really wanted to like tackle my
closet and tackle all my fashion stuff
and do guys know I'm obsessed with shoes
and stuff so i made a shelf it's like
shoes and then shorts jackets jeans
sweaters oh my gosh you guys I have over
50 sweaters what like because I was
playing around with this app and kind of
organizing my closet and it's really
cool because i was taking everything out
of my closet and snapping pictures of it
to put into the shelf i actually was
able to like organize my closet by leg
chin and color and it's just it makes me
super happy what's great about snaps is
that like when you take the picture and
you pin it you it's kind of like
Pinterest and Instagram in a way where
you can like follow people so if you see
like shelves that you really like then
you can follow them if you like
following makeup shelves and you can see
what like other people have in on their
shelves and stuff and then it kind of
like inspires me to let go to purchase
something it's kind of like you know
when you're watching a YouTube video and
someone does a tutorial and you're like
oh my gosh I'm obsessed with that lip
color and then you go out and you want
to buy it it's kind of the same thing
like I get inspired by seeing like what
people have in their makeup collection
and you can also write a description on
the product and also another thing that
I find good about this which i actually
discovered the other day when I went to
target with one of my really good
friends she went and bought like an
eyeshadow palette thingy from Maybelline
and when she got home she realized she
had the exact same one already and she
wasn't crap like i just bought the same
exact one and i was just like how did
you not realize that she goes well you
know i have a lot of topi colors and
stuff so i think that stuff's is a good
way like if you take a picture and
you're out the store and you like to see
something you're like wait a minute do I
have this already and then you could
check and you're like okay I do you can
also take pictures of your receipts and
like take pictures of the price and post
it so you people could see like how much
everything costs and I know I just think
it's a really good idea to like stay
organized and you just know what you
have in your closet or your makeup
storage or anything like that you want
to keep organized you just have it all
there on your phone and you don't ever
have to like worry about it again and it
takes like two seconds to like take a
picture like I had so much fun I blasted
music the other morning and I was like
going through my closet and I just felt
so like good to get everything out of
the way the first thing you see when you
open the app is just the explore page
where you can see different accounts and
you can see your notifications and all
the kind of stuff and then if you go to
this section you can see all the
different accounts with the different
shelves like this one says makeup and I
saw this one that said nails which I
love looking at nail pictures for some
reason so then you can just look at
pictures and like them and then this
account i really like so i decided to
follow it
and then you can look at your stuff
which just basically means your shelves
you can go through them and manage them
and then also you can go to your profile
which mine is Alex see if you want to
follow me and just look at your shelves
like this one is full of my shorts I
have so many shorts it's actually crazy
and then to take a picture let's say you
want to start a new shelf you can take a
picture of whatever you want and then
all you would have to do was named the
items so this is just the soft and
gentle by Mac the mineralized skin
finish and then you can choose a shell
but I haven't created one yet that was
called makeup so then you would just
name whatever you wanted to name the
shelf like this one I'm calling it
makeup and you can decide if you want it
private or not which this one I want
public and then you just post it and
you're done
I know you guys are obsessed with my
fashion taste in my closet and um I mean
I thank you so much that's a huge
compliment to me but if you're
interested in seeing like everything
that I have in my closet I'm still going
to go back like every day and I'm doing
like crop top snacks and then kimonos
and like a bunch of stuff I'm gonna have
shells for everything and then I'm going
to go in and do my makeup collection
also so if you guys are interested in
seeing what I have in my closet like
literally everything then i'll leave the
link down below in the description where
you can like to download the app and
also leave my own username because i
made a different username that i
normally use just because i was like
testing it out but um yeah so if you
want to follow me and like look at my
like shelves and stuff i think that'd be
really cool and then like I would like I
could like follow you guys back and see
what you have in your closet or your
makeup storage and like we can just all
have a big party and go shopping for new
stuff even though we really don't need
more stuff but you know it's honestly
really up to you guys so if you like to
follow accounts that are more shoe based
or if you like to follow counselor for
like purses I know my sister would
probably be obsessed with purses because
she just has this thing for purses or if
you're more into beauty or even hair
hair care products and stuff and
skincare their shelves for all of that I
just I'm drawing more towards fashion
and shoes like that's just like my thing
like jeans jackets sweaters shoes all
that kind of stuff like that's what I'm
drawn to so that's kind of like what I'm
creating but you guys can like honestly
mess around with it and create anything
you want and it's just a really easy way
to stay organized like I said before I
don't know I just I'm feeling really
good especially that it's like spring
cleaning time and it's exhilarating and
I just feel like so much more like I
don't know I just had this like weight
lifted off my shoulders I'm like wow my
closets actually organized I'm also
going to be selling a lot of stuff
because it's just
so yeah it would be really cool if you
went and followed me on the app because
I don't know it's just cool if we can
all just like follow each other and just
like stalk each other's closets could
such as fugg for me but anyways I hope
