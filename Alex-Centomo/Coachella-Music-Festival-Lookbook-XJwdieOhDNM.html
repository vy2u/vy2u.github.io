probably tell from the title this is a
Coachella lookbook if you didn't know if
you're not following me on like snapchat
Instagram Twitter basically everything
you wouldn't know that I was just
recently in LA because I went to
Coachella even though that's not in LA
but you know what I mean I was in
California because I went to Coachella
which is by the way music festival
that's in California for all of you guys
that are wandering so I got a lot of
questions about that and I just kind of
figured everyone knew what Coachella was
but if you don't it's just like an
awesome music festival I'm showing you
guys a few outfits that I personally
wore to Coachella and then a few other
alternative options that I think would
be great as well if you follow or if
you're subscribed to my vlog channel you
will know which outfits I wore so if
you're curious to see which ones I
actually wore check out my vlog a little
self promo there and follow me of course
on all my other social media things to
keep up to date with what I'm doing but
without further ado let's just get into
the video my first outfit of the weekend
is probably my favorite outfit ever I
just love the simplicity of the white
dress and then the fringe purse the
little brown booties and then the
details of my sunglasses and a little
bend down I have on my head the booties
are from Freebird by Steven the dress is
for love and lemons and the little purse
I have here is from Windsor I'm obsessed
with it because of the fringe and then
my bandana is from Free People as well
as my necklace and then I have
peer-reviewed of bracelets and my
sunglasses are key by Australia this
next outfit is another one of my
favorites just because the flow enos of
everything so these shorts are from Free
People the top is some Free People as
well yes that is me dancing like a crazy
person this whole outfit is basically
free people but I'm just obsessed with
it
my jewelry is from Shanor jewellery I
don't think they sell it on their
website but I know that Free People has
on their website as well as reball
clothing and then my shoes are just
Birkenstocks
my sunglasses are ray-bans and I have my
hair up in this little half-up bun
thingy that I love rocking when I'm lazy
and I have greasy hair this outfit is my
Vanessa Hudgens outfit I like to call it
because she wore something from the same
brand last year and I just am obsessed
with this company they're called spell
design so I'm wearing the same booties
that I did before because I obviously
didn't have that much room in my
suitcase and then I wore this like
playsuit thing from spell design my
jewelry is Schnoor again I love it all
put together and then my sunglasses and
headpiece are from Windsor this outfit
would be perfect to wear on a really hot
day because I know that when I was at
Coachella it was really hot somedays so
the top is some free people as well as
the Hat and then the shorts are one
teaspoon the belt is from Windsor store
but I got it last year and then these
booties are just the same ones as before
because I thought it tie the look in it
together perfectly and I love the back
detail of this top it's awesome
this next outfit screams my name it's
just like exactly what I like to wear
for music festivals so the sunglasses
hat and top are from Windsor these
shorts are brandy melville and the
kimono is from spell design and I just
love everything about this outfit it was
so comfortable to dance in and just kept
me warm and it was cold at night but the
kimono was breezy for when it was hot
during the day this next look is for all
of you casual girls out there so if you
don't want to wear something too
bohemian
I'm wearing the same shorts from before
from one teaspoon as well as this really
cool top from Free People that has like
slits on the sides and it's really
comfortable and breezy
just with my Birkenstock sandals and Ray
Ban sunglasses if you like the casual
look but want to keep it a little bit
bohemian you can try out this tunic it's
super cool from three people and then I
put the Free People hat on as well to
kind of dress it up a little bit but I'm
wearing the same shorts underneath as
well as the Birkenstock sandals and then
these sunglasses are from Windsor
they're like little heart-shaped and
they're so cute I love them
I actually saw this dress everywhere at
Coachella it was actually funny but it's
so cute so I don't blame everyone for
wanting to wear it it's from spell
design and again I'm wearing it with the
same shoes and what I love about this
dress so much is the open back about it
it's so so so cute and it's just super
flattering and it's not too hot not too
cool it's just like the perfect festival
dress
I like to call this last outfit my gypsy
outfit daniel says I look like the
blonde Jasmine which is awesome because
I love Jasmine but the skirt is from
revolve clothing I love it so much it
was so flowy and beautiful the top is
from Windsor store as well as like most
of the jewelry that I'm wearing I just
love how this whole look kind of came
together and again I wore it with the
heart-shaped sunglasses and a little
hairpiece but I didn't show in this
video I just I love this look
so I really hope you guys enjoyed this
video if you did please give it a big
thumbs up I am like super inspired by
all these look books that I'm seeing on
YouTube so I thought I would do a little
