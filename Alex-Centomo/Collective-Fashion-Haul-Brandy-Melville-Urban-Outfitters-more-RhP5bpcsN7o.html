don't you think I want shopping the
other day yep kind of okay that's a lie
I've been shopping constantly since
forever but these are the things that I
bought recently that I'm going to show
you that about because a lot of you guys
request these videos i love watching
hauls i know you guys love watching
hauls i know a lot of you say you can
inspired with my fashion but i do want
to say one thing this is not a try on
haul because there's literally no point
of me doing one when i have a fashion
instagram account where you can see what
all of these clothing look like on me
for my instagram so i will have the link
down below if you want to follow me
there for anything that i haven't posted
yet on instagram will be up probably by
next week because i'm going away and
purposely bought some of this stuff for
my trip that i'll start off with urban
outfitters because i only got two things
the first thing I got was this top it's
just a crop top that says Fila on it I
honestly got it because I love the way
that the shirt looks like I love the
shape of this shirt the sleeves are a
bit big but they're not too oversized
and it's a nice cropped top I got in
this size small and to be honest like I
don't really care about feel I feel
that's not like oh my god like an
amazing brand to me but I really like
the way the shirt looks so that's why
and the next thing I got from Urban is
my favorite thing ever if you watch my
blogs you will know that I'm obsessed
with this sweater so I got it in the
men's section it's a grey oversized
hoodie it that says obey on it I don't
even know what this picture is of this
creepy man but it's the softest thing in
the entire world I got in a size medium
for men so it's really big it's just so
soft inside
and I always steal my boyfriend's hoodie
so I was like you know what I'm just
gonna buy one of my own and I can wear
it all the time and it's a saw this
thing oh yeah just a warning there's a
lot of grey in this video as you guys
know my obsession with grey and sweaters
this hair is gonna be pissing me off all
video oh I just filmed like a hair
tutorial for you guys and I have all
this like texturizing spray and like
screaming my hair now so it's all going
crazy but yeah forgive me
I guess Brandis next the first thing
from brandy is this cropped gray sweater
of course it's super cropped and it's
really comfy and the sleeves are like
three-quarter lanes so I just really
like this with high-waisted black jeans
and sneakers or booties so cute the next
thing from brandy is this turtleneck
t-shirt so it's just a look little
turtleneck long-sleeve regular t-shirt
it's tight it's super thin and super
soft and it's gray so that's why I got
it I have yet to wear it but I'm so
excited to play around to this I love
turtlenecks and I love long-sleeve
shirts oh this is another shirt I got
I'm just wearing it now it's like a
cropped t-shirt with this detailing on
it super simple then I got this shirt
because I love stripes and I just like
the way that this shirt looks so yeah
that's why I got it super soft I know
you guys love brandy melville but I
think this with just classic black jeans
like so nice for the fall time I just
really like the way stripes look on my
body which brings me to this next
t-shirt which is this corrupt 3/4 length
sleeve tight tee it's actually quite
thick but it's very stretchy
oh no this thing broke but this was $20
Canadian I actually got this because one
of the workers is wearing it in the
store and it looks so cute so that's why
I got it
next thing is a light light gray almost
white sweater so it's knit and it's
long-sleeve but it's a turtleneck so it
will show you I literally just got this
stuff so that's why still all has a tags
on it but it's just like a cute little
cozy turtleneck I'm so excited to wear
this in the winter I'm going to New York
City in December and I always wear
turtlenecks when I go to New York City
so I'm excited to Iraq this when I'm
there the last thing I got from brandy
was this skirt these skirts are super
trendy right now and it's just very very
comfortable it's corduroy it's stretchy
which is awesome because as you know
Brandy's one size so that just makes it
easier for everybody that way then I
went to Victoria's Secret and I got two
sports bras because
really needed a sports bra I was using
like really old stuff so I got two which
were the seamless fit so this is the
white one and what I really like about
it is that it's not a bra because I just
hate bras guys so this just like holds
your boobies in place it's reversible
it's really comfortable super stretchy
does not feel like you're wearing
anything and it keeps your boobs in
place so they don't flop around
everywhere then I also got this color so
this is the like gray color but you can
also make it black because it is
reversible then I got two pairs of jeans
so I got one pair from cage denim which
if you guys haven't watched my favorites
video you know I'm obsessive Paige denim
jeans so I got another pair these are
high-waisted black so they're super high
waisted and they have rips in the knees
but on one side I think there's two rips
I wear the one Instagram a few times
love them
super comfortable Paige denim is
literally it feels like leggings I love
it and it's jeans it's so comfy so I got
that pair which definitely is a splurge
for me but I mean after I bought that
first pair I was just like holy crap
this is like the most comfortable jeans
and I was wearing them every single day
so I decided to get another pair black
this time in high waisted then I got
these jeans from Topshop
mainly because I love the color so
they're high-waisted like the other ones
they're the Joanie jeans right
yeah Joanie and they're just the light
gray ones with the rips and the knees
and I get them in the long size like the
32 or 34 because I have very very long
legs and then I'm a 26 around if you
guys are wondering my waist but 32 or 34
length probably this is a 32 so I mean I
have the longer leg so it's kind of my
problem because if I don't get that then
the rips are like not on my knees and
they're like on my leg which is really
awkward so I got these because okay the
reason why I got this color was because
in New York City catgut Cabal got a pair
of jeans from I think J Brand that were
this color and they were so nice and I
loved every outfit she styled them with
together like simple clean classic black
booties
like a nice flannel shirt or just even a
nice dress shirt was so nice but those
jeans are like three hundred and fifty
dollars and to be quite honest J Brand
Jeans or not that it like they're not
that comfortable I owned maybe two pairs
before and I just did not like them so I
decided to get Topshop jeans because
they were $60 instead of 300 and their
women were comfortable okay then I did
some shopping on Nasty Gal
which is a website I'm sure you guys
have all heard of it the first thing I
got oh no it's all tangled it's a
necklace which is like a layered
necklace oh my god how is it gonna work
okay there's a choker there's a diamond
and another diamond and then a longer
piece that goes down your body so it's
so pretty on can you guys even see that
okay next I got this bralette because I
love Rolex and I don't own anything like
sexy ish like I have a few 411 lemon bra
lets but this one's like kind of sexy
and I just got it cuz of the straps
basically so it looks like this this is
gonna be really hard to show but this
part covers your nipple over here and
then it has these two strappy parts here
that go up high so when you wear low
tops the straps show which are so nice
and four eleven lemons is really
comfortable I find and this was on sale
so that's why I got it because they're
very pricey and then I bought it
purposely to wear it with this shirt
which is from Nasty Gal as well it's by
the Brad Nasty Gal it's a size small
it's just really baggy oversized with a
super low scoop neck that literally will
show the straps so well and there's also
a pocket so I'm excited to wear this in
LA I was thinking of wearing the
bralette with this the necklace the
Topshop gray jeans and then this on top
which is a denim jacket that I got from
Nasty Gal so freaking excited for this
so there's rips everywhere it's like a
really distressed denim jacket and I'm
planning on wearing it over my shoulders
like this so comfy and so cute I'm
obsessed I love Nasty Gal denim jackets
when they're oversized like look how
cute this is
I love the color of this so I have a
really really light one that's a vintage
Levi's that I got from Urban Outfitters
and then I have the dark one with a star
which is from Nasty Gal and now i have
this one which is like a an acid-wash i
guess kind of thing and then the last
thing I got which is quite random but I
got me a pair of boots so these are the
new style and they're like the new
classics they have a bit of a heel and
then the front is more slim than the
older ones do remember the old herbs how
they were so like big the front part so
these are like perfect they fit your
feet perfectly you don't need to wear
socks because they're so fuzzy and
because where I live is very cold I wear
these all the time and they're black so
they go with literally everything so you
can still look somewhat stylish while
you're warm in the winter because it's
so cold where I live guys like oh okay
so I'm going somewhere on Wednesday and
it's warmer there so I definitely am
gonna be bringing warmer clothes and
then I am gonna get ready for New York
City after that I want to live in New
York so bad like I'm so jealous if
everybody that lives in New York City
because that was my dream place to live
there so bad or London but London is a
little bit unrealistic because it's so
freakin expensive how do you guys live
in London for any of you that do what
the actual F like I look just for fun to
see and like a simple flat like maybe I
didn't do proper research but the flats
that I were looking that I was looking
at which were very small which whatever
size isn't a huge deal but just take
this into consideration it was a very
small flat one-bedroom and you pay
weekly there and it was a thousand
pounds a week like what that's like to
almost two thousand dollars Canadian
that's ridiculous like I cannot equate
what I don't get people like I'm unless
you're like loaded but like that's crazy
to me so yeah that won't be happening
unless I find an amazing deal or I
become super rich plus it's kind of far
from my family
I don't know but New York City is just
like perfect for me I want to live there
so bad anyways I hope you guys enjoyed
