I'm actually filming this the next day
this video is kind of all over the place
basically little backstory before I get
into the video I got a new lens
so I'm using it right now I'm testing it
out you are probably gonna hear the
shutter speed just because I'm not too
sure how to silence that or if there's
any way to silence that I got this lens
specifically for the fact that it
doesn't make a lot of noise when it's on
autofocus but it does make noise still
so I think it's just kind of confusing
anyways what ended up happening
yesterday was I film my haul video and
then as I was editing it I realized
there was a huge booger in my nose so I
had to delete that so I decided to
refilm it and then I filmed it with my
friend Kat I realized that so much of it
was like out of focus because I had done
it on manual and don't know what I'm
doing with this new lens so I sincerely
apologize for the fact that it's a
little bit blurry but don't worry guys
I'm really working on like figuring out
this lens and stuff and I know like a
lot of you have been kind of complaining
about my lighting so I'm trying to
figure that all out but hopefully you
can bear with me for this video and also
I don't think I explained it I was kind
of editing it but this is not a try on
haul because I'm actually filming a
lookbook video when I'm in Turks and
Caicos with all the clothing that I'm
bringing so basically those clothes are
going to be shown in the video what they
look like on me and everything like that
so just stay tuned for that keep your
eyes open for that video coming very
soon and let's just get right back into
the video
Catherine is here by the way did you see
Joe sign two ghettos in video with his
brother no cat watch it just talking
about boogers Joe's reaction oh my god
that's so funny guys seriously go watch
it Joe sign to God oh he's so funny Joe
cute I need to walk no do I have
anything in my nose cut I did kind of a
mini haul on my blogging channel so some
of the items that I'm range turks was
shown there so I'll link that down below
if you guys want to see that but I've
been really into like dress shirt kind
of things like this that have buttons
and I don't explain these how would you
explain this like a dress shirt
yeah like a blouse dress shirt but kinda
looks like a manager but isn't yeah
button-down so I like wearing these like
tucked into shorts are tucked into pants
having the sleeves rolled up and having
this pretty open you guys know I love my
deep B's so I got to from szabo skirt
this is the first one I think this would
be so cute with a 10 I say cute a
million times I'm sorry I got this one
from Tsavo skirt it's black but it's
short sleeves but it's really long and
really big and this I would definitely
tuck into something or I would just have
it completely open with a bikini and
kind of tie in a knot shorts I think
that would be really awesome as well so
I got this in a size small cuz it's
oversized and this one of the size extra
small but this was really oversized as
well
Sallis skirt their sizes are so weird
because sometimes I'll get a large and
it's small and sometimes I got an extra
small and it's large so I don't really
understand then I got the shirt from
revolve it's another dress shirt blouse
type thing it's unbuttoned all the way
and it stripes it's a bit thicker I
don't know what the material this is but
I think this would be super nice I'm
actually going somewhere else maybe in
March so I could definitely wear this
there I really like it then another one
there's so many I got this from a shop
off and it's kind of similar to the
other one ish but the stripes go this
way on top and this doesn't unbutton all
the way and it's more of a light blouse
material that doesn't wrinkle which is
amazing because you could throw this in
you suitcase and it doesn't wrinkle and
I was thinking this shirt or this new
hat that I got it
like that and then these new jeans so
there are dark gray how cute with this
outfit be those seriously with black
booties so these jeans I got from
revolve they're citizens of humanity
they're just high-waisted dark gray
jeans super stretchy super comfortable I
really like the fit of these they really
kind of hug everything together and keep
its shape so my butt looks good yeah
this is what I would wear in Europe
guests down below where I'd be going in
Europe if it ends up happening then I
got this thing from revolve it's a
romper it's white with a cream lace
detailing on on the sleeves and in the
front as well as on the shorts and I got
this cuz ii love vintage actually has
this and she was wearing it in mexico i
thought i was so pretty so I'm actually
gonna wear it completely I'm done
there's also a snap here that you can
close it but with the bikini I think
would be fine and then wid this romper
I was thinking I'm wearing this belt so
this belt it's like that one that's from
below the belt except this one's way
more inexpensive from their bald cuz
below the belt is like really expensive
but I think this would this would be so
cute let me guys know let me guys know
let me know what you guys think is if
you don't think it's cute that maybe I
will
then my new obsession our palms because
I think they're so cute again I said
cute but like they just hang off your
purse like this like a little pom-pom
and they're fuzzy I got these two from
Windsor so they're obviously faux fur
very inexpensive I think that would be
cute too actually obviously not too at
the same time but still really awesome I
got these genes from revolve as well I
went on like a revolt Finch because they
have such cute clothes this is from
frame frame frame denim and they're
high-waisted mom jeans so they're so
comfortable they're very soft they're
very wide leg and there's a rip on the
knee and I would kind of just roll them
up once and my ankle sticks out and you
wear them with heels so I was thinking
this top with one of the dress down not
just on the dress blouse shirts tucked
in with heels would be so cute and Turks
for dinner or something I got this top
from evolved as well I was just thinking
this with plain jean shorts it's a crop
top off the shoulders very boho and
pretty this is from Stealth spell
where's it spelled gypsy designs so this
is like Vanessa Hudgens favorite brand
for Coachella but I really like the way
this is this is a size small it's very
stretching actually kind of big so if
you're gonna order something like that
just slides down then I got some bikinis
oh wait I forgot something these shorts
these shorts are from sideways skirt as
well they're really really really cute
blush pink pale pink I don't know how
explain this you will see in my lookbook
they are so comfortable and flowy I
think these were sandals and like a
black crop top would be so
what's another word for cute adorable so
adorbs then I got bikinis so the first I
guess we'll talk about this because it's
a one-piece it's so nice look how pretty
this is it's a one-piece it's from
Frankie's bikinis I actually have the
one that's striped but this one is
reversible and is also striped so I'm
thinking of maybe giving away my other
one but I weren't in Greece so if you
cares to see what that looks like on
check out my Greece videos so nice I
even have pictures on Instagram but I
love the way this looks on and I love
the colors in this like pink blue
flowers with the Townies he's so nice
and then I got this bikini top from
Sahara Rea swim she's awesome she's like
an Instagram
earng slash model and she has her own
bikini line so I got the new one which
is the moonshine top I believe or
moonstone moon something and it's just
like a metallic e purplish silver color
I don't get the bottoms because they're
very expensive
so I just got the top but it fits like a
glove and I'm thinking of just wearing
this for tanning I think it's so cute
with again.i so cute with just like I
was
with a cheeky bottom either black or
white maybe wait I think white would be
nice at this to other bikinis the first
one the top is from Miko and I think
this is awesome because I had this
obsession lately with like palm tree
leaves so this is white and black which
is great and then it's palm tree leaves
and the back is very strappy you will
definitely see a lot of pictures on
Instagram with the speaking you talk and
then the bottoms I got are from from
left for love and lemons and they are
high-waisted bikini bottoms but it's
kind of weird because they have this
string that attaches around your waist
so kind of pull your waist in I don't
know how to explain this but it actually
looks really good on so I was thinking
of wearing these two together because
they obviously are just black and white
and then I got another bikini that's
black and white I feel like I'm not
saying the words properly I got another
bikini that's black and white from same
swim and I actually had never heard of
this Brad before until basically
Instagram looks like this I got the
black and white one there's also one I
really like it's all white with black
trimming but what I didn't know is that
it feels like neoprene material so it's
very thick and like if you guys have a
triangle swim so you kind of know what
that feeling is and then you have the
stitching around which is actually
really nice and flattering it really
holds up the boobs nice and it's just a
basic triangle top and the bottoms look
like this
I got the one with string and it's a
little bit cheeky really cute I feel
like I've so many more bikinis now if
you guys want me to do an updated bikini
collection let me know I did one last
summer but I really like got rid of a
lot of bathing suits and got a lot more
so if you're curious let me know then
the next thing I want to talk about our
shoes I got you these
everyone said these are like impossible
to get and every time I wear them out
people freak out they're like how did
you get those but I honestly got them on
the site they were just available when I
checked and they're not anymore I looked
again but they're honestly the most
comfortable shoes ever they're the moon
stone ones very basic and like neutral
color love them so much then I got a
pair of Adidas Stan Smith all white with
the black in the back really wanted
these for a long time and I think these
are perfect for traveling because
they're so easy to slip on and off when
you're going through security and when
you're on the plane I love it I'm one of
those people that hates to wear shoes on
a plane I take my shoes off as soon as I
sit down I look at that book and the
last thing I want to talk about our
sunglasses so I have two per Windsor
that are very similar I don't know where
the other one is but they look like this
I like them I wore pair in Hawaii that
are very similar and you guys all seem
to really like them I then got ki
Australia Times
Amanda like there Amanda steel
sunglasses basically you know make up my
mind you on YouTube she did a collab
with them they're just very big aviators
it's cool because you could see like
blue from the side that I'm looking
through everything looks blue I really
like that are these ones called
from Isle m8h LEM I don't know the brand
but I saw them online I really
them they're mirrored sunglasses I think
they look so cool so these last pair are
from this brand that I have no idea how
to pronounce LS stiva l estava
the Westin ah let's see that I ll e ste
ba Elliston anyways it comes in this
case and they're really cool
Oh God um I think these are awesome with
my hair up like on the beach I like them
they're very different and unique
there's stuff here that I showed in my
vlog like I said before so if you're
curious to see that I will link it down
below sorry I keep touching my hair it
