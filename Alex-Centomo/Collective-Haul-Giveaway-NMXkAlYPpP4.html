do a haul today because I have done a
lot of shopping lately and actually what
ended up happening was I was away and
when I came back I had like ten boxes
waiting for me now it's just like oh my
god it's christmas it's like the best
thing ever so um without further ado
let's just get started because I can rob
okay so the first thing I'll start off
with the most exciting thing and kind of
like a big purchase but I have been
saving for this for a while as you all
know i have started vlogging on my
second channel and I've been doing
weekly vlogs but I also did vlog my said
sometimes I through and I throw in a
daily blog here and there now because
I've been traveling a lot i have been
blogging a lot of my travels so like
Barbados then I was just in LA for a
shoot with Windsor I'm going to be doing
something else in March and then I'm
back in LA for Windsor again we're going
to maybe do a meetup and also go to
Coachella so for all of these trips and
stuff I wanted a better quality camera
um and also because my sister has really
wanted a camera and I figured that I
would just upgrade my camera and get
from my old one because since she's not
like doing this as often as I am she
doesn't need to go out and like quiet
super expensive camera where is like I
had that cover for a few years and I
figured anyways I gave the cover to my
sister and then I got this one now I am
super excited to get this I have been
saving up for it it's the canon g7x a
lot of youtubers uses for blogging and i
honestly read so many different reviews
about it i've read reviews for like Sony
cameras for Nikon cameras and for Canon
and this one for vlogging has by far
been like the best one has down and I
honestly like I just got back last night
but I'm obsessed with it already i
actually bought this purposely to use
for the windsor shoot that i just did
but it came as soon as I got back so
whatever but if you're interested in
seeing that vlog it's so much fun Korean
and I actually got to go to California
to do a shoot for Windsor we actually
got to meet tests and after like months
and months of like stalking each other
on Instagram test my finally got
me and it was so much fun she's like the
coolest down to earth chick ever so if
you're interested in seeing that just
click the little thing right here or if
you're on your phone you can click the
link in the description i'll have it
down below and let me know if you want
to hear like a more detailed I guess
experience thing because that would be
so much fun to kind of like talked about
like everything I was feeling and
everything like that so yeah just let me
know and i don't know i just really like
this camera I'm super super stoked to
start using this and I can't wait till I
bring it at all my next trips because
it's just so much better to be able to
see that you're in focus because there'd
be so many times I'd be out of focus
anyways Tess actually uses this camera
and she had on the trip and I was like
yes good purchase Alex good purchase
okay so i guess the next thing i want to
show is something i'm wearing right now
this is just a top from fresh tops it
says i would date you but you're not
Dylan O'Brien I know I thought it was
super funny i love like quirky graphic
tops especially like to like lounge
around in at home i think they're funny
if you don't know who dylan o'brien is
he's an awesome actor he's in teen wolf
and he was in the maze runner he's like
expected to play something pretty big
but i forget anyways he's super cute i
love him a crush on him so though i'm
gonna wear this shirt and then the next
year i got from fresh tops is this one
and it's just like a cat out i guess
like screenshot of Harry Styles tweak so
it says it's like his twitter name and
everything and it's when he tweeted I
study rainbows and I thought that's so
funny because like obviously I study
rainbows duh but I find these tops
especially the white ones are like the
most like they're so soft so I love
wearing these to bed and stuff and like
when I sleepover parties with my friends
because I still do that I wear this top
is super comfortable because i made my
snapchat story public when I was in
California I was wearing a few students
and when I got back from Barbados I've
been wearing a few suits on my snapchat
and so many people asked what like what
they were where I got them so these are
the swimsuits that I have been showing
their from San Lorenzo the keys I
obviously leave all the links down below
but basically this is the first bikini I
got it's like a strappy won't know
stroppy it's a strapless bikini top and
um this is the back it's awesome like I
don't know I think it's so nice I love
the colors in the details and I love the
fact that it's reversible so you can
wear it on just like the basic blue
color or you could have the pattern
which is super cute as well I love this
and then it comes with the bottoms that
are like this so San Lorenzo's known for
its cheeky bottoms but I love wearing
cheeky bottoms to tan in so this is the
back yep just gonna say that but I
absolutely love them and then this is
the side of it how's this like caged
detailing I think it's so nice and again
these are reversible they just have to
blue on the other side and the pattern
on this side but I love wearing this
pattern I think it's super pretty
especially with a tan like right now I
have a tan and I think this color looks
so nice my face is like so pale compared
to my body right now my car wash because
of the lighting a second one that I got
I actually like wearing on the plain
white side so it's the same thing except
it's just as simple there's no like
details on the side this is the pattern
it's still super cute like it's just a
simple like pattern that has red and
green and stuff and blue designs but I
prefer just like the white especially
with a time like this looks so good guys
like white on tan skin and then the top
is when i get the most questions on
because um as you guys know I've been
working out like crazy and I actually
wear this as a sports bra um don't ask
me why I love it the back of it is just
like caged and it has the same pattern
on the inside that i showed before but I
love wearing the white and I don't know
I like wearing this as a sports bra it's
cute as a bikini too but like I don't
know I like the way it fits in my movies
when I run keeping on the bikini trend
um as you all know I
kind of obsessed with full piece bathing
suits that are like cute like not like
speedo bathing suits that I wore when I
was a swimmer because like no but like
cute one-piece bathing suits that are
like open back and stuff I actually went
on revolve clothing com you guys know I
love that website and I picked out this
awesome bathing suit oh my gosh you guys
I'm so obsessed with this it goes low in
the front and then it has these like
mesh cutout details and then this is the
back it's like super open back I'm
absolutely obsessed with it so this is
by the brand al a blue or a love blue
com but I got it on revolve clothing com
and then the next thing I got on revolve
clothing were my gosh I'm apps actually
obsessed with these okay you know i love
one teaspoon but like few shorts are
sick like they might not be everyone's
cup of tea but they're like boyfriend
shorts to wear them low down but they
just like go like midway down your thigh
and make your legs look really long
actually cuz i wear these with heels and
i don't know i just love like they look
rolled up look at them I think they're
super cute and I wear them with like
black booties so my legs look extra long
because i do have already long legs so I
just think it's just so cute with like a
crop top or a like like oversized t kind
of tucked in I love that look so I'm so
excited to start wearing these I'm going
to be traveling a lot so I do need
shorts and obviously those of you that
live in warmer climates this would be
good for you you could definitely check
out the links below and check out the
prices and everything for all these
items I did some shopping on daily look
so the first thing that I got were these
shoes they're sam edelman circus by sam
edelman there i don't know how to
explain them they're amazing i freakin
am obsessed with these they're just like
shiny and black and i would wear these
with tight high-waisted black jeans with
rips cuz i think that's cool and it's
like a classic white tee love that look
i love these so much and then
next thing I got was actually I bought
this format because she wanted this
purse that she saw online and it was
like over a thousand dollars or
something crazy and then I was like hey
dailylook has one that's like literally
like hundreds and hundreds of dollars
off that price like so affordable and
it's identical so it's this purse right
here and I'm actually really upset that
I didn't get it for myself like I think
I'm gonna buy it in black because it's
so nice it's just a simple like
crossbody bag you can wear crossbody or
over the shoulder whatever you want and
then to open it up it's just a snap and
then there's like a zipper because I
find purses that have zippers are so
important so you don't lose your stuff
and it's super spacious inside like have
so much room and then there's just a
little zipper on the back you can hold
like small things I don't know I love
this and I really hope she likes it and
then I picked up something for myself of
course as I can't just like not buy
anything myself and of course it's a
sweater guys don't say anything but it's
just an oversized cardigan but it's
fluffy and soft and amazing and it's
just a simple cardigan and what I like
about it is the sleeves are kind of bail
I don't know how to explain this but
this is like so comfortable okay and
then the last thing I want to show you
something that I got a few months ago
but I didn't actually think I was going
to use it to be honest but then when I
was traveling to LA I needed like a
backpack that wasn't my super old ghetto
brandy melville American flag back back
like I wanted something a bit different
so i used this one it's actually super
cute and it came in so much handy like
it is way bigger than I thought you
could fit so much stuff in this plus
there are so many pockets and the front
pocket fits like so much it's just a
simple backpack but i don't know i
effing love this like this is amazing
it's from current Elliott i'll leave the
link down below if you want to check it
out um I don't know like I traveled with
this I had like the Rolly suitcase
carry on then I had this so I could keep
my laptop my book my neck pillow thing
and like obviously like my creams and
stuff that i needed i put that in here
plus in the front pocket I put my camera
my chargers everything like that and it
all fit like my computer charger
everything fit in the front and it
wasn't too happy you can adjust the
straps in the back it was amazing and
then I just had my little Free People
purses purse but I don't know I was like
perfect amount of stuff that everything
that I needed to and I was like wow
