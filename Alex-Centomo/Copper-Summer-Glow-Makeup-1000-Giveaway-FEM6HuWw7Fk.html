channel I've been getting so many
requests to do a makeup tutorial and
it's been a really long time like months
and I'm not a makeup artist I don't
really know what I'm doing that I was
sent a lot of products recently so I
figured I would do like a summery kind
of thing that I would wear like out or
to a nice dinner or like an event or
something but experimenting with all
these products that were sent to me so
yeah if you guys are curious to see how
I did this then keep watching also I do
have something exciting at the end of
this video but make sure you watch
through to the end to see what that is
please don't skip forward and let's get
started so I just put on some
moisturizer beforehand first thing I
like to do is just kind of spray my face
this is new this is a hydro charred
complexion prep priming spray there's
coconut water a word I cannot pronounce
and CIPA tonic I heard it just a really
good hydrating spray also going to use a
setting spray
so I'm going to try it out that is nice
oh that smell good I look bald okay so
starting off with primer this is from
Tarte and this is the poreless primer
mattifying primer not the biggest fan of
anything mattifying because I like to
have more glowy complexion but I'll do
the afterwards I guess just this just
helps with like shine and stuff see the
consistency okay this reminds me of like
a Smashbox one sort of gooey consistency
go bomb pretty smooth it's not as nice
as my one from YSL I think the one from
Smashbox might go on a little bit
smoother this one seems to be a bit
Dicky it still seems to warm up in your
fingers so this one excited to try out
this is like it called medics and this
is their CC plus cream this is a color
correcting full coverage cream plus
anti-aging hydrating serum and SPF 50
plus I always wear SPF no matter what I
like to put sunscreen on as well this
has SPF so that's great oh there's like
a little pump that's cool I like that's
more my drink oh it's stick okay and
this is a brush I don't know if this is
the brush you're supposed to be using it
with but I'm going to use it with this
and this is also from it cosmetics oh
well I don't think this is the right
brush for this and then this brush is
too fluffy it does seem to blend out
pretty well I'm going to try with my
actual foundation brush to see how this
goes with something bit more dense yeah
this is a lot better I don't know what I
was even doing with that it has a bit of
a smell which if you guys are sensitive
to that I mean it blends well it's just
thick I don't always wear like stick
things mind you this does have like
sunscreen in it what I do no sunscreen
is thicker if you think this doesn't
match it's because the rest of my body
super dead and my face of course is not
Wow it gives some amazing cover so I
feel like I don't even need any like
concealer I'll probably put some anyway
it is but I really don't feel like I
need any
that is a really good job and you guys
buy all these two pumps yeah I really
like that has a bit of a dewy finish
yeah that's super nice huh
definitely don't use a brush like this
if you guys know what this is for let me
know because I feel like a complete
idiot Wow so this a little product goes
a long way now this isn't new but this
is my concealer right now so one that
matches my skin perfectly by
Kevyn Aucoin put a tiny bit on the
places that I think I need a bit
more concealed plus this just adds
dimensions you don't have like such a
flat base so one thing I do notice is
the primer that I put on definitely
modified my skin but I think it's a bit
like drying and I do have a really dry
skin so I need more like a hydrating on
primer but it still works really well
it's just like not the best for my skin
oh this is really nice so like it's
setting really well on my face I haven't
put any spray I mean over this yet then
I will set this so this is by a cosmetic
as well and this is the bye bye pores
setting powder oh that noise ooh that
gave me chills oh my god a cat how do I
open this without wanting to die top of
it and tack typically I'd use my Beauty
Blender but I don't have it with me
right now so I'm just going to actually
use this to see maybe this is for like
actual setting powder
so I actually love how fine that powder
is I don't bake my face and oh like a
lot of people do that I don't do it but
this would be really good powders to do
that like I know this is really really
similar to the laura mercier one that i
have oh my goodness
I'm gonna volunteer out one of you guys
could tell but I actually got them ready
so they're a little bit more shaped like
not the best they're also growing out
but there was so much better when I was
in Spain oh my god Quinn impression out
this is my tart as well let's see if
this color matches me I mean that looks
pretty good I like to think I know what
I'm doing but I really don't like does
that look okay the problem with me is
that I have a really bad eyesight and I
wear glasses but I can't wear contacts
because well I mean I could but they're
really expensive to get because my
prescription that's eyes like you guys
don't even want to know it's a
ridiculous there's so many things wrong
with my left eye so it's just like so
expensive so I try really hard to like
do this properly but I feel like I just
fail every time do they look okay like I
wish you guys can ask me right now this
product is freaking awesome though I did
in like two seconds I was so fast this
eyeprimer from Tarte this is the lid
lock I'm really bad and I like never use
primer for my eyes but then my eyeshadow
is always crease remind i like the matte
paint pots do you remember those do you
guys still use them oh my gosh when i
first started watching youtube like back
in my day 2009 or 2008 even I watched
Michelle Phan obviously cuz she was like
og and juicy star and I used to buy
every single products that they would
recommend and everything was from Mac
like everything I owned Mac everything
and then support opened up my mall and
then it was the greatest thing because
then there was more option like I found
of the Mac it was great but it was like
the same stuff whereas like before
there's so many brands so many different
things you can look at and I just really
liked that I mean that seems like it
works fine so I'm going to be doing this
palette today this is the new Naked
palette it's called urban decay naked
heat I really like the colors in it
they're like this I don't know which
ones I'm going to use probably well
because it's shimmery and I want to do
shimmery I have green eyes so if you
like this would look really cool whoa
that's like I never wear color on my
lids that's crazy I totally thought this
is going to be a bronze color that's
super nice and I'm going to take a bit
of dirty I know scorched put that just
on the outer corner of it kind of fade
in whoa that's crazy low blow but unlike
the crease to blend it I go so
cross-eyed when I do this if I don't
concentrate it's so funny take a little
bit of that scorched color and go
underneath and then actually blend it
because what the hell am i doing this is
smell like mud on my lids I swear
actually it's not bad then taking the
pale or color and putting that on the
inner corners as well as just the center
of my lid and then under the brow how's
that look I feel like that looks crazy
without any mascara liner so moving on
to liner I kind of want to use this this
is from Urban Decay as well this is the
24/7 glide-on eye pencil and alkaline
and I thought this would tie in well
with the colors I'm just going to really
put it on my upper lash line after
mascara this is covergirl total tease
has a little ball at the end just cool I
also just woke up so my voice is like so
bad I'm going so cross-eyed oh my god
I'm what K this is what happens when I
go cross-eyed like yeah
there's like all those girls on the
internet that are so good at makeup and
like so pretty when they do and they
look professional I'm like and this
happened in some of my videos and you
guys actually figured it out you guys
just pointed it out oh my god and
literally look I'm going cross-eyed I
can't help it
oh my god Oh like I just fine I'm just
going to keep it like why why is it
always happen I feel like I really did a
bad job of blending how do I fix that
you guys know I feel like you guys are
better at this than I am
if you know how to like fix that kind of
stuff let me know for next time okay
okay I'm going to use this bronzer this
is from Too Faced this is not new I've
had this forever but I wasn't sent
anything new so I'm just going to
contour I would love to get a contour
stick like a cream one do you guys
recommend anyone like any of your
favorites let me know and I'll get that
one because I think using that instead
of a powder is probably so much better
for my skin since my skin is so dry now
I'm actually going to use this one from
tart it's like a duo blush and highlight
see what the color looks like oh that's
pretty that's pretty subtle but I like
it and then after highlight there's this
one from Tarte which is like a stick
thing that's so nice
put the tip of my nose on top of my lip
so weird to put it there I thought once
somebody did on YouTube and I like that
okay oh look at that oh yeah Oh y'all
down oh that's so nice I'm using this
lip liner from buy cosmetics
this is in the shade 0:50 I've use this
before but I don't have a lip liner
we're going to need a lip liner and I'm
very lightly over line then this
lipstick from urban decay and the shade
fuel it's really nice nude cat Belle key
challenges what combination is ugly in
my room I didn't realize I put this like
nude over this purple color is that ugly
you look pretty hairy looks good no but
come look at my lipstick what you're
look like I put I put this lip liner I
thought it was like a nude but then it's
totally also design the little Liberty I
doesn't okay
so this is literally the completed look
but I'm just going to spray it so this
is the finished look guys I hope you
enjoyed it I actually really love the
