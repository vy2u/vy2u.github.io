channel I am currently sitting on my
living room floor because denna I
actually just filmed a video together
that's going to be probably going up
next week all about our wedding so we
kind of answered all of your questions
and everything like that I'm really
excited for that to go out but just get
it but I figured I'd put this video up
first because it's um Oh Matthew okay
Burano saying um whatever basically this
is requested to do an updated favorites
video which I have not done and I don't
even remember the last time a done a
video like this because I've been using
the same thing for so long I was like
why am I going to make an updated
favorites if there's nothing different
about my routine but there are a few
things now that I have been credit which
enough and I've talked about a lot of my
vlogs but I realized that I forget to
tell you guys because I have so many
different viewers throughout my
different channels so if you guys are
curious to get a more behind-the-scenes
in-depth look with my life and like when
I do let's say change up some products
or travel or do whatever kind of thing I
do have a vlogging channel as well as I
do vlog almost daily with my fiance so
we have a couple vlogging channel it is
primarily like his channel he definitely
edits and does everything and does all
the work for it but I'm all not like on
a daily so I figured today I would show
you some things that are different in my
routine but still like basically things
you've been asking about for a very long
time so I'm going to start off with
makeup because this is a question I get
all the frickin time is my lip color
what is my lip color and every video I
post every instant picture I post and
it's always typically the same thing I
alternate between like two but they're
the same brand so I use this lip liner
which is by bite why is it'll scratched
off but it's just a lip liner by bite I
don't know oh it's 0:50 that's the
number of it but it's just like this
color and then I use it with the Kylie
cosmetics lipstick in Malibu these two
things together are like my Holy Grail I
wear them all the time there
kind of a nude brownie MALDI combination
I guess and I even in person so many
people ask about my local color so
that's what that is I'll also leave
links for everything I can find down
below so you can find the exact items
then another thing and this was sent to
me so this is by YSL and it is the can't
even read it cuz it's sparkly oh here to
shake saw blur not centerbridge to shake
la blur primer so this this stuff is
literally incredible I even wear it when
I'm not wearing makeup so if you guys
can see it's like this liquid mmm it's a
little as a gel consistency and it has
little flakes of like gold sparkles and
this stuff I put it on my face before
I'm going to apply makeup and makes your
skin so smooth and just like those
reports and it's like flawless like just
a blank canvas perfect for putting
makeup on top I use this even when I'm
not wearing makeup because it just makes
your skin feels so smooth and just look
like poreless you know the one thing I
do have to say though is that it doesn't
like if you have you know acne or like
some spots that are sticking out
obviously it's not going to make that
disappear but if you're having like a
good skin day and you just have some
like acne scarring or so I call them
craters because like that's what I have
on my face I just make I'm wearing it
today as you can see it's just like it
makes your skin look so nice and a lot
of you guys have been noticing that in
my videos so thank you and I really do
think it is this to be completely honest
it is on the pricier side obviously YSL
it was sent to me but they're not going
to send it twice and I'm definitely
gonna be repurchasing this Mike as soon
as it's done and I had this for maybe a
month and look how much I've used like a
lot cuz I love makeup I think what for
the makeup this everything else is
pretty much the same like I kind of just
go through a cycle of the same products
that I use over and over again that I've
shown in like all my videos before
skincare the only thing would be this
this is Giorgio Armani or Matt or Mott
this is George Oh George why can't I say
it you guys know what it is Giorgio
Armani and it's C this stuff smells
amazing oh my gosh I'm almost out of it
actually given to me when I flew from
where was it we were flying from Qatar
to Bali and we had all we're all able to
upgrade on our flights like super cheap
so because it was a really empty plane
so we all upgraded and they gave us a
little kit you know sometimes when you
sit in like I don't know if you've ever
sat and like premium economy or business
class whatever look if you like a little
kit with an eye mask sometimes they'll
give you a little like lip balm or your
ear plugs or whatever socks they gave us
Georgia Armani cream perfume like really
good products and this stuff smells
amazing it's lasted me since then but
it's like literally at the end and end
and I'm definitely gonna need to
purchase another one cuz it smells so
good like anyone who has the scent
you'll know what I'm talking about it's
just really really nice and mixed in
with my perfume I find it's like a
really good combination so talking about
perfume I have actually been wearing I
got this for dad for Christmas and it's
just like a gift off of all different Jo
Malone perfumes not really Cologne
they're basically Jo Malone is unisex so
you can kind of switch it up but I'm
loving I've been loving to test out the
different scents my favorite from this
one is the pomegranate Noir and then
also the basil and neroli is really good
with wood sage and sea salt
all these scents are really nice they're
not as kind of a scent that I wear on a
daily which is wild zigging cassis which
is also discontinued I'm so fed over it
but I like stocked up before they
discontinued it discontinued it but I've
been loving to try out the different
scents from this so sorry Dan still has
cents to see oh really good and then
another weird thing that I've been doing
is wearing men's deodorant I don't know
I like one time without of my deodorant
and I was kind of in need of it and so I
just thought that if I can use his which
some people might find gross but like
he's my fiance I don't care we literally
share everything so I used his and it
smells so good and I felt like a guy the
whole day and all yes this smells
amazing so then I got my own and this is
um Old Spice dental Dunlop Denali how do
you say that with spruce basically it
smells like a pine tree kind of just
smell good
like it and I'm not sure if this stuff
is good for you or not I literally don't
know anything about deodorant so please
feel free to inform me down below
because that is something I want to look
into but this is just what I've been
loving lately because it smells really
good and I don't sweat um okay on to
hair because hair had been a question
for so long about like what I've been
doing so update yes I dyed my hair I
died out once a year and I recently just
got it done I usually do it right before
Coachella product-wise the only
difference is I switched up my key
protective spray because I don't use
heat in my head often but when I do
obviously I want to spray so this is Bai
Zhi Zhu this is Megan's key protection
spray you guys know I love her she knew
like literally all know I'm obsessed
with her stock all her videos this stuff
is just it's so good it's so good
her hair oil and this definitely
recommend I know test my always rave
about it but for real it's like it's
worth it it's worth the money I know get
so many questions it is worth the money
I bought to 140 FL for Christmas as well
and she loves it and it just it's so
sleek and pretty and it smells good it's
just like
I love it that is also product wise now
I'm going to move on to some fashion
favorites so since it is currently
spring even though in Montreal it's kind
of cold and not like the weather's like
so up and down but I've been loving
yellow yellow is my jam right now I
think it looks so pretty I should have
worn the shirt for the video but this is
from brandy it's just a simple yellow
key I think it's so cute and it's like
not too bright it you know a basic
yellow color but I think it's so pretty
at this time of year especially in the
summer when you have a nice 10 I just
think it looks through it and a lot of
people say yellow looks good on me I'm
also sort of blonde but and then I have
been obsessing with florals lately and
this has come to be a new favorite top
of mine this is from Windsor and it's
still available online it looks like
this it's off-the-shoulder it's cropped
and how things really pretty details on
the sleeves but I just love this floral
pattern so much I think florals
obviously a perfect in spring but I
think it's a great transition
summer as well because you can get away
with wearing florals all the time even
this was a denim jacket is so cute or a
nice little hat for an accessory some
high-waisted jean shorts or high-waisted
jeans some booties or sandals like you
can't really go wrong with a top like
this that's why I love it so much and
the sleeves are just like three-quarter
lanes really pretty they have an elastic
at the bottom so if you wanted to roll
them up you could do that as well or not
roll them up but you know like slide
them up like that another thing a lot of
you guys have been asking if you follow
me on instagram you will recognize this
jacket so these types of jackets they're
like bombers I see them all the time now
Liz windbreakers that are super sporty
or like bomber type things with like
cars and stuff it's super in right now
this is actually mine from when I was 12
I'm not even kidding you my grandfather
got me this and a Ferrari one that's
like bright red and they've been at my
parents house and like their basement
closet for years and I've been seeing
them and I'm like oh my gosh I have that
jacket so I went home and I got this yes
it was um gifted to me by my grandfather
it's a Mercedes one and he I think got
it at the f1 racing here in Montreal
they have the Formula One racing thing
we're all you know they come in from all
over the world to do the race car stuff
and yeah this was gifted to me from my
grandfather so I don't think you can buy
this anywhere I will try to find it but
this was from so long ago but it's
definitely a favorite of mine and I
really love that look of having like a
jacket kind of hanging off your
shoulders when you wear just like a tank
top or something I think that just looks
really nice and then the last clothing
item is this sweater any kind of
oversized cropped ish sweater is like
what I'm all about right now so this one
is from wild Fox and I got off four bulb
a while ago but I know you can still buy
it on the website it looks very
distressed
super open back so you could you know I
know some girls wear it like in the
front open and it'll have a look super
off the shoulder which is nice as well
the cute bralette but this is like this
I literally wear this all the time it's
a softer sweater I own
then lastly are accessories so I guess I
put these as accessories I don't know if
they are but they're the Adina's the
triple whites nmds the first ones like
the first version I know everyone's
talking about the second version right
now but I personally like these ones a
lot better they have like the little
blocks on the side and it was actually
cat who introduced these to me and I
found a pair on eBay for like pretty
good price so I just got them and they
had my size and yeah they're super comfy
they're really really light material the
only thing is I did stain them on this
side when I went to France because we
walked through caves and I kind of got a
little dirty but that's fine I'm like
really not crazy when it comes to having
super white shoes I kind of a lot of
people are like that but I really like
could not care about it they're just
like pretty white shoes and they look
really white anyway so it's not a big
deal and then the last thing I've been
loving are disposable cameras these are
so fun Polaroid's disposable I got this
from Urban Outfitters and it was very
overpriced it's like twenty dollars and
you're paying for literally the cover
which is marble looking what I got it
for picture in mind but honestly you can
buy them you know you can buy them on
Amazon for like 4 bucks so I do not
recommend buying one for $20 looks like
such a waste of money you get the same
quality when something that's four
dollars I like sleek good job but I
haven't actually developed these yet I'm
waiting I have one more picture left so
I'm just going to like tape on my sister
or something then go get them developed
I think it's so fun to have little
pictures like I remember that as a kid
having physical pictures you look
through photo album you have like these
memories that you can hold with your
hand and no risk of them getting deleted
or you know if there's something about
like for me to I love reading books
rather than listening to audiobooks
I love having like the sting in my hand
and touching in and it just feels a lot
more real to me that way so that's why
I've been really into those lately and I
just think it's so much more fun for
memories and you can - you're gonna kind
of display them over your house your
room and I just think it's so great so
that is it for my current favorites I
hope you guys enjoyed it who
you let me know on a comment down below
