really exciting video I worked really
hard on it so I hope you guys enjoy it
now that the holiday season is coming
around I just get super excited to start
decorating my room I like to decorate my
room for like every season but Christmas
is definitely my favorite time of year
and I love decorating my room for that
time I figured instead of just buying a
bunch of stuff I would kind of try out
some DIY things I've never done a DIY
video before so hopefully you guys enjoy
this if you do let me know in the
comments what other videos you'd like to
see and yeah let's just get started so
the first thing that I'm going to be
recreating is this beautiful cinnamon
candle and it's perfect purse
centerpiece for a dining room table or
even just in your room I think it's so
beautiful so the first thing you'll need
is just a plain vanilla candle some
twine some of your favorite holiday
ribbon that I got at Target an elastic
band a glue gun and some cinnamon sticks
the first thing you're gonna want to do
is just lay down some paper on your
surface so that you don't dirty anything
just in case because this can kind of
get a little messy
then you're gonna want to just measure
out your cinnamon sticks I had really
really big ones so I decided to measure
them out towards the candle and then cut
them in half as you could see they went
flying make sure they're the right
length for the candle and then you're
just going to put the elastic band over
the center of the candle like so and
then you're gonna start sticking these
cinnamon sticks into the elastic bands
so that they're gonna stay put in place
around the candle I really can't stay
baby it's cold outside baby it's cold
outside
open the to drop down hold your hands
there just like and then you just gonna
take your twine and you're gonna wrap
that over the elastic band so that I'm
just placing it underneath and I'm gonna
be wrapping it around a few times just
so that it covers up the elastic band
it's up to you personal preference but I
just find the twine looks a lot more
rustic and nice down the chimney once
that's done you're just gonna cut that
and you're gonna kind of just pin it
underneath another strata of twine to
make sure it stays put in place then
you're gonna take your holiday ribbon I
just found this one at Target I think
it's so nice and you're gonna hot glue
gun that around the twine so the twine
is just acting as more of a barrier
between the cinnamon sticks and the hot
glue
a cup of cheer have a little Christmas
and when you walk down the street once
that's done you're just gonna secure the
rest in place and make sure that it
stays all day with the hot glue gun
here's a merry little Christmas
let's show and what I love about this
candle is that the cinnamon really
brings out a different kind of scent
with the vanilla it's so warm and subtle
I just love it so much and perfect for
this time of year the next is one of my
favorites because it involves candy but
all you'll need is some candy cane
sticks some mmm
mint chocolate whatever kind of caddy
you find then a big mason jar and you're
just gonna literally pour all of your
candy into the mason jar and then you're
going to take your candy cane sticks and
stick them in all around the edges and
this makes such a cute little
centerpiece or even for your bedside
table it's super cute and you can just
snack on it all the time and it makes me
super excited for the holidays cuz YUM
doesn't that look amazing like I'm gonna
go get one right now this next idea
makes a really cute centerpiece as well
all you need is a candle I found this
one at Target and then you're just going
to need a bowl and some fake snow and
then you're also going to need some of
these kind of like very looking things
and I found this all at Target and then
you're gonna take the candle and place
it in the center of the little bowl
thing put the snow all the way around it
and then I'm literally gonna cut pieces
off of that like berry tree thing and
I'm gonna place them in because I just
find it add something a little bit
different and more texture to the snow
and makes it all really pretty
then I just went outside and found some
of these cute little tree things from
the Christmas tree and placed them
inside to add a little extra touch
this next one I kind of found the idea
on Pinterest so you just need some
cardboard cut-out
a hot glue gun some yarn color of your
choice and then you're simply going to
take the cardboard and kind of fold it
in half add the hot glue and attach it
together I'm then gonna take a simple
scrap paper and I'm going to write some
inspirational quotes so quotes that I
found on tumblr or Pinterest and this
one is just my favorite quote ever it is
happiness is a choice and I really do
believe this if you have a cut in your
desired length you're just gonna roll it
up like a little scroll and then you're
gonna attach it with the yarn so I just
find this super cute and dainty and
you're actually just gonna place this
inside the little envelope secure the
two ends together and it's just like a
little kind of present for every day
before Christmas
once the two ends are secured you're
just gonna add a little bit of hot glue
to the center and then you're gonna wrap
the ribbon all the way around and then
write a number onto the ribbon so from 1
to 25 and then every single day you have
something to open and you get a little
inspirational quote and it just makes
you happy for the day and I find it's
such a good idea to stay positive
I actually like to place these in my
Christmas tree but I don't have my
Christmas tree yet but that's basically
where I'm gonna put them the next thing
is another really cute centerpiece and
it's super easy to make all you need is
a wooden tray of your choice some
pinecones some regular pinecones and
ones with snow on them and some fake
snow your then just basically going to
pour the fake snow all over the tray and
then you're gonna add in your pinecones
and kind of mix and match them and then
add in the rest of the snow on top of it
so it basically just looks like there is
such a beautiful snowfall that happened
and it's very dainty and such a
beautiful centerpiece then all you have
to do is add them into your room and
you're done voila
