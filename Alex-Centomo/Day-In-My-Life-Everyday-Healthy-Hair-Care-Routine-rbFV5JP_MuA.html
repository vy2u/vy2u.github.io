a.m. on Wednesday September 16th I just
got back from New York City and I
figured I would take you guys along with
me for the day I see a lot of these
videos going around YouTube a day in my
life video but I wanted mine to be a bit
more real oh so I'm literally gonna
bring you guys around with me for the
day to see what I get up to in a
youtubers life because as you guys all
know I'm not in school so YouTube is my
full-time job YouTube social media
Instagram all that stuff and a lot of
you guys ask questions on like how I
film how I edit other kind of stuff so I
figured I would just bring you along
with me for the day and let you guys
know what I'm up to and what goes on in
the youtubers life that lives in
Montreal first thing I do when I get up
I lie in bed for a little bit and go on
my phone which I kind of just did for a
bit then I drink a bunch of water and
then I usually go for my workout so I'll
bring you guys with me so I try first
thing in the morning to drink around 1
or 2 big cups of water before I do any
workout I read somewhere that this helps
with your digestive system working up
first thing in the morning there is like
specific times in the day that if you
drink certain amounts of water it does
something different to your body I'm not
a nutritionist so I don't know but I
just know that drinking a lot of water
is good for you so I try as hard as I
can I know it's hard but I really try to
drink as much water as I can in the
morning so I'm gonna drink 2 of these
and then I'm gonna go work out and if
you are curious to see what I do when I
work out I will leave a link to my
workout video down below that I just
uploaded like a few weeks ago I do the
same thing almost every single day so I
kind of went in detail for that so if
you're curious in saying that I'll have
it linked down below so since a little
bit cooler right now in Montreal I'm
gonna be I'm still gonna be running
outside and doing my workout outside but
this is what I'm wearing just this is my
dad's band's t-shirt that I like cut
open I'm wearing a sports bra wearing
some workout shorts I'm gonna grab my
headphones go for a workout and I'll be
back in a second ok so I just got back
from my run
I'm extremely hot right now and sweaty
so I apologize for that but I about to
hop in the shower and a few weeks ago I
actually mentioned that I'm going to be
using a product from Pantene's new
expert collection line and I want to
kind of test it out and see how it was
and guys
I have been loving this product so much
I want to show you guys how it's been
working for my hair so I've been using
the this is the advanced keratin repair
this is the shampoo
so I actually shampoo and rinse my hair
twice so I'll put this all over my roots
I just focus on the roots like really
massaging it into my scalp and then I
rinse that out and then I do it one more
time and it just adds like extra volume
and stuff to my hair and what happens is
when you rinse it out the rest of the
product goes down your hair because I
have very dry hair so it does fight
damage and does helps with shine and
everything and then I come in with the
conditioner so this is the same it's
from the same line it's the commissioner
so again it does the same thing it just
fights damage provides shine and I
really focus this on like maybe from my
like mid or like a quarter way down all
the way to ends really focusing it on my
ends and I have been loving this and
then when I get out of the shower when
my hair is not 100% damp I will actually
show you guys this afterwards but I
can't obviously film myself showering so
that would be very inappropriate but I
put this in and this is called a split
end fuser and I put this on my ends and
it works freakin wonders guys it's
amazing and then if I'm gonna be styling
my hair if I want to add an extra shine
this is what I come in afterwards this
is called the karag√∂z it's just like an
oil and you could spray it in your hair
to add shine or if your hair is kind of
wet before you style it before you
blow-dry it it just adds that extra like
super healthy look to your hair so I'm
gonna go shower and I'm gonna show you
how I use this product
shower done and I just I really want to
say this guys that this stuff you
instantly feel your hair just feeling so
much better so it claims that it's
supposed to erase two years of damage in
two minutes now whether or not that's
true because obviously I'm not a
scientist I can't tell but I could
definitely feel a huge difference like
my hair especially the ends just feels
more thick I don't know about you guys
but I suffer a lot from like very thin
damaged ends like my hair I don't have
the thickest hair ever but my ends are
like so skinny like I'll put all my hair
together and it'll be so thin so I just
thought I want to try this out and it
definitely has made a huge difference
I've been trying it for around two weeks
now and I could definitely see a
difference to not just feeling it and
I don't know about you guys but I just
feel like when you're when your hair
feels good it just helps you feel more
confident throughout the day like when
you having a good hair day you're like
yes like you want to go outside you know
what I mean like we're having a bad hair
day you're like oh gosh hide but this
just helps me you feel a lot better so
Oh
hair comes out of the towel and what I'm
going to do is add a little bit of this
into the ends of my hair and then what I
do is I use a wide tooth comb to kind of
just comb it through so it says where
I've normally been doing is I kind of
just I do two pumps into my hand like
this rub it around I gently just rub it
through the ends of my hair like this
just lightly you want to make sure you
don't like go like that throughout your
hair you just kind of gently rub it down
really focusing on your ends at least
for me that's what the most damage is so
I kind of just like smells so good guys
mmm
then I take my comb and I start from the
ends and I work my way up that way when
you start from the ends it gets a little
bit of product into the comb and then
you bring it up like that and look it
just goes through so soft so once I'm
finished just combing through my hair
you could see a huge difference I mean
my hair is still damp but you guys will
see once it's dry how much like my hair
just looks a lot thicker and a lot
healthier if you even follow me from the
beginning of my channel you will know
how dead my hair was so this is a work
in progress guys then it says to do this
when your hair is dry in my ends get dry
really quick so I just spray just a
little bit throughout my hair this stuff
smells amazing I wish that was a perfume
cuz I would use that every day and again
just brush through once that's done I
like to let my hair air dry so sometimes
I'll put into braids sometimes I'll
leave it down so I'm just gonna leave it
on for now because I'm gonna do my
makeup and if you know anything about me
know that I don't wear makeup on a
regular day basis today I'm not going to
be wearing a lot so I'm just using a bit
of powder foundation just to kind of
even out my skin tone because my skin
tone has been
little wacky lately so and also doesn't
match the rest of my body which is you
know it's always great
got to make sure it always blend down
your neck and you want to see where the
magic is all I do next is use just a
like brow tint because I have no arm
pills and a mascara and that's all I do
now I'm just gonna get changed to let my
hair air dry
I don't be back with you in a second
what's on Mount now fairly lunch or
brunch whatever because we will probably
decide to come eat and this does happen
a lot I can eat out a lot which is bad I
should start cooking more it's a goal of
mine but because I've been traveling so
much I don't have much time there isn't
much in my fridge so I'm just here
eating and at this like fifties diner
that I love so much and then I'm heading
to brandy Melville to pick up some
clothes and stuff for an upcoming video
so I'll show you guys it's like what I'm
there and so far my hair is drying
naturally feeling really healthy and
thick oops
not eating that healthy today but dine

healthy and I got an Arnold Palmer which
is basically homemade lemonade and iced
tea this is my cheat meal of the week

picking out some stuff for an upcoming
shoes ok so I just got back from brandy
Wolff no I'm back I'm back in the car
now but I wanted to give you a little
update on my hair so now it's completely
dry as you could see but you could just
tell Kay if you know me at all in my
personal life you will know that I have
a problem with my hair being like
straight on top and then like underneath
gets curly cuz might the top of my hair
is so unhealthy but look guys it's
actually curling like I bet you right
now to all of you guys that know me
firstly you're gonna be like whoa

which means it's getting healthier so
that just goes to show you that how well
the stuff works these are my ends look
