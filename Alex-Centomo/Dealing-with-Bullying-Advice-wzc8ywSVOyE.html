housing Christina hello who you guys
have all seen in my blogs before and we
decided to come up with a little I guess
segment yeah a little segment know like
look fat yeah it a bad thing just happen
is the chat page nothing no but we
wanted to kind of have like a little
discussion about bullying because we
both have gone through bullying
throughout our lives and I know that a
lot of you guys struggle with that on a
daily basis and you guys I get so many
emails from you ask him to cover this
topic and I thought that it would be a
really good idea because I mean we've
talked about that a lot yeah our own
personal experiences with with just
having a hard time in school and with
other kids yeah well not only kids like
teenagers and even parents yeah like
parents bullying from whatever so I
thought it would be kind of a good idea
to discuss that yeah I would have loved
to have something like that when when I
was going through it yeah I was sort of
shy I i I've talked about this before
but I couldn't even raise my hand in
class because I thought that people are
going to judge me if I said the wrong
thing even if I knew the answer was
right I was like too scared to say
anything I don't know I I would I wanted
to raise my hand and I wanted to take
part but I would turn beet-red yeah you
remember that yeah I used to blush all
the time uncontrollably and and the
worst thing when you get red I realize
now if I blush it's just funny I'm like
I'm really read but when I was younger
people will be like oh my god you're
blushing your red I'm like I I know can
I can feel it and the more people talk
about it more read more read you get ya
or you just want the floor to open up
and swallow you I just remember being so
embarrassed I would just not say
anything and then if you get put on the
spot oh my god that was the worst
teachers like Oh Christina or Oh Alex
nearly like bread and you're just like
I'm just gonna cover my face oh my gosh
gonna just gonna not red have you ever
been a bully my teacher or felt like
you've been not bullied but like kind of
singled out or like no not not really by
a teacher that's never happened to me
that's happened to basically i had a
french project and
I wasn't the strongest in French but the
program I was in was very like advanced
and everyone in my class was very good
at French because he all came from like
French backgrounds and we had a project
and because I was so shy I was way too
embarrassed to like raise my hand and
asked what it meant so I actually didn't
understand the purpose of the assignment
and it was an oral presentation and it
was like weeks later and I was too shy
to ask any questions to ask whatever it
meant so i kind of just did what I
thought I need to do and I presented it
and it was completely wrong so not only
did I have to present something in from
the class in French which i was
super-embarrassed about but it had
nothing to do with and the teacher got
really mad at me and she thought i did
on purpose how old are you I was 13 but
I look like I was eight also have you
all seen pictures of Alex 13b I'm so
cute are you gonna put ya right here
okay do can you do that yeah perfect um
yea though he in grade eight so picture
that and me trying to give an oral
presentation on something that had
nothing to the topic of course the whole
class laughs because they were like what
is she doing and um they let me present
it don't know what happened was they
asked me to the office afterwards to
talk to me and they knew I was a really
shy person like you a teacher can tell
ya shy kids and I go in there and it's
not like I did it on purpose the
assignment wrong and she started getting
mad at me and yelling at me and saying
like how could you do that you know like
you knew the assignments about like why
would you do that blah blah and I was
having such a hard time understanding
her because she was yelling at me in
French that I started crying and I was
in the office with all the other
teachers and they were looking at me and
I started bawling my eyes out and she
was just like ahh oh my gosh and one of
the other teachers gave me Kleenex and
then she started talking me in English
she was like very okay I was like I'm
sorry I just don't understand what
you're saying I don't I didn't burst
down the project but I'm too shy to come
say anything like I'm so embarrassed and
then she felt really bad but it was just
it it was strange to me that she got so
mad knowing the kind of person I was
like I was in her class for almost a
full year before this happened I was
trying to get you not in best wait maybe
but you out of your shell maybe there's
nothing worse than feeling kind of a
singled out like that yeah when I was
young it's not the same thing
but I my first language is Italian and
there's people that speak Italian in in
our city yeah schools are not Italian
schools or French or English and my
parents put me in French school and when
I started school I was at this time home
only tell ya no I I was first of all I
switched schools like 20 times when I
was really young cuz i I just I was
terrified if the whole experience is
just like I want to my grandparents yeah
but when I was when I finally had to
start pre k um I didn't like I didn't
know how to speak English or fridge so I
I couldn't speak to any of the kids its
tariff when you're really young that's
really isolating and I remember the only
reason I was okay with staying in school
and I was when I finally they finally
found a school after like 20 tries was
because the teacher was Italian oh I'm
so sheer I'm reminded me of my Nona's so
the whole class I would just like super
shy little me would like stand in front
of the class like right now for the
teacher and not talk to anybody else and
I finally made a few friends that also
spoke Italian and then my parents
started speaking English to me and it
went to French school so I I learned
quickly you very quickly thanks a lot
languages now yeah so that's a good
things a good thing but at the time at
the time it was a traumatized it was
traumatizing so we're actually talking
well I was talking to my sister the
other day and she was saying how she
used to be bullied by a boy and you said
you were believed by yeah I was bullied
by a boy and grade 3 and 4 at the same
school that I was at is it cuz he led to
was he just mean apparently he liked me
apparently I mean but he he like punched
me a few times and he would he would
shove me in the schoolyard and I was
whoa yeah it was awful and I would go
tell on him and obviously he would get
punished and this and that but it was it
was really scary and he it hurt a lot
boy actually not hit girls actually ran
into him a couple years ago like Sam
everyone yeah I didn't remember him go
see Miss of this guy you know who shall
remain a new yeah we're out like
downtown one night and he's like hey
christina is like hey what's up but I
was like hey I going because it happens
that I guess see people don't really
remember the other
remember we was and then he told me his
name and I was like that's you like this
guy punched me when i was 7 in grade 7
and 8 Mars okay my head knowing for
fasho that you make it look look like an
eight-year-old kid I'm not even kidding
I was 46 until grade 10 yeah 464 I
remember I used to babysit her remember
yeah um yeah so I was 46 no style I
remember wearing one time these like
fleece pants with finding nemo on them
and a monkey shirt don't ask me why and
my I had come back from the pool
technology here now yeah maybe God um
and you know what's weird is that I
could wear the most popular thing but
because I was wearing it it wasn't cool
I remember this one story this one time
my sister came to my rescue there's this
girl that was really mean I love this
story i love this right so there's this
girl that was really mean to me in grade
7 and 8 like real bitch okay she was so
so mean to me for no reason I did never
did anything to her she just did not
like me for whatever reason and um she
would just constantly make fun of you so
one day I was wearing sparkly nail
polish and she's like yo ali why wearing
sparking sparkling al-haj that's so ugly
and I was just like I was too scared to
say that I put it on because I liked it
so it's too embarrassed so I said my
sister punnami when I was sleeping and
she's like yeah sure I'm like no she did
but like totally not true and then like
two days later whatever obviously I took
the nail polish off two days later I was
in the locker room after swimming and
she was there and my sister was just
waiting by me and so she's like getting
changed and she looks at my sister she
goes so Kyla did you paint your sisters
nails with sparkling I'll posh while she
was sleeping and my sister goes looks in
her shoes yeah and I remember like I
just look at my sister like oh my god
and then the girl was just like oh okay
whatever housing up oh yeah it was like
cash for one I shouldn't lie but thank
you so much Kyla for that's an okay life
yeah that's an okay lie yeah it's hot
it's hot of the lighting swear
oh we have this thing that one meal
after we get excited we sweat the other
thing i find that is if if this could
help at all mm-hmm if anybody is that I
when I was being bullied in school I was
so ashamed of it really yeah I was like
I was shy first of all and I was like I
was scared to tell my parents or my
family or my friends or anybody yeah I
couldn't tell anybody which i think is
is not good I think that if you are
going through something it's really
important to have someone that you could
talk to you whoever it is you know just
to talk to somebody because it sort of
takes a load off and maybe I can also
help you they can help and but then when
I switch schools i was in new girl in
school for grade 5 and 6 and the popular
guy told somebody he thought I was
pretty I think and so the popular girl I
was jealous i found not that pretty in
grade five I was like super buck-toothed
and like okay but you were always cute I
was but like I was awkward looking you
know you know yeah but its exact but the
popular girl decided to turn everyone
against me and I and one girl became my
friend just so that she could like read
my diary and tell the other girls I and
I used to call me on three way and
pretend somebody wasn't there and sing
songs about me literally mean girls no
actually I used to be mean girls I I
used to cry myself to sleep every night
it was really bad and all the school
outings and all of that stuff I I didn't
want to go to and we weren't telling
anyone until anybody Wow yeah and until
it's sort of i had to tell people
because i was like i refuse to go on
this like retreat with the school or
take part in the school play and i
wanted to so badly oh my god it was
awful it was it was terrible and it's
really it's really sad when you don't
share that with somebody you feel alone
yeah you are yeah in that you're not i
mean so many people and then now that i
talked about it and meet so many girls
and you know he's been guys not not only
girls get bullied you know we're we're
obviously but guys get bullied too I
actually had a guy friend growing up
that was bullied really badly because he
was just different than everyone and
there's nothing wrong with that he's
actually super cool now and has a
million friends but the time so many
people made fun of him because he was
just not the same I have girls that
bullied me in high school and I see them
now and they have no idea that they even
believe me yeah really like they didn't
know that was bullying they were like oh
you're just really sensitive and I'm
like oh no I mean perspective sometimes
yeah I never I've seen some of the girls
that you don't say anything no I don't
say anything they're probably also
jealous of you know except for one time
when I I ended up going to a new high
school okay so I was supposed to go to
one high school where all of these girls
were going and then when I finally told
my mom about all of this you say like no
she was like you're not going to that
managing school that's I switch schools
before school started should I just get
away from me all this it's not theirs
it's not running away from the problem
but it's also not you're just so you
don't need to i had to go to a new
school anyway so i switched i went to
another school and when I told my best
friend that I that I met who stole my
best friend to this day Liana I'm Tanya
thank you but um when I was telling her
about this she was so mad that we
instead of seeing one of the girls on
the bus and she was like was like a
packed bus and she kind of like shoved
her off oh she was so mad I was like so
funny didn't hurt her vayan con at the
end sorry guys but seriously it was a
little shove leanna's also like a five
foot two I know she she's right I can't
like picture for doing that no I know
it's least not know she's so cute yeah
but yeah I also want to say that payback
is not the answer as well because there
are so many times ride me thinking of
like revenge and things honestly the
best thing for revenge is success and
when you are just bettering your own
life yeah completely happy in your own
life then these people look at you and
they're just like I never thought about
that was one thing I never I never was
like a revenge vegetables were you I
told my parents everything I would come
home crying be like this person said
this like I was such a tattle-tale but
like they've got a tattle-tale that's
yeah I guess yeah good Wyatt told your
parents I did
I didn't know this is a time I'm
actually went to the my teachers and my
principal and was like can you just keep
an eye on her and like make sure that
everything's okay and my teacher was
like completely oblivious he was like
Ali's being made fun of oh my gosh like
no she's best friend to all the girls i
was just like as a no joke I didn't know
like wow that's so and I think about it
like now and like things that they would
say to me really is not the end of the
world like at all it's cuz I was behind
we're really bad really yeah well I mean
someone hit you yeah yeah like they used
to sing songs about me but get me to
sing them with them and like I didn't
know that me oh god it was awful yeah
that's anyway honestly all things
changed so much i realize i wish you
leave at once doing today high school
seems like it's the biggest thing in
life but it's not i didn't have social
media when i was growing up and that
must be another factor in it all because
one thing that was when i was going
through all of his stuff at school i
could go home and be with my family and
be with you guys and it didn't exist in
like i would just be able to sort of get
away from it yeah and where's now it's
like yes cyberbullying is a huge thing I
mean people commit suicide constantly
because of cyberbullying and it's so
hard because you just can't escape it
yeah I mean technically you can turn off
your internet but put off your phone but
really in yes I you know um I just know
so many girls that do get bullied and do
struggle with it so much not even just
girls boys too and it's so hard but you
need to realize in the moment that
whoever's bullying you obviously has an
underlying issue is not it might not
even be you personally you know it just
it probably isn't know if you're just an
easy target yeah you're just an easy
target like they have problems with
themselves and sometimes these people
don't even realize what they're doing
like Kyla didn't get bullied because
really I'm sure she got she got really
badly bullied oh did she one year but
like majority of her adolescent life
because she's not an easy target she's
not this you say Symington my line she's
gonna talk right back I definitely stick
up for yourself yeah and don't be scared
to like tell your parents yeah I'll some
friends yeah tell a teacher for real
because don't keep it in it they can
help you even if you think like you're
all alone even if you think that this
happens to
when like I can guarantee you that
almost every single person has gone
through some sort of bullying in their
own world in their own perspective right
at San about perspective and and you
don't know what what someone is going
through you never know that's one thing
I really learned that even the provider
believe girl you don't know what they're
going through at home or in general
doesn't give them a right people you
know but just to understand sort of a
bigger picture and know that it will it
gets better it does life is so much
better after high school it gets better
I mean there's other things that are
really hard after high school you know
yeah necessarily better and easy but
yeah it's that kind of thing high school
isn't isn't your whole life yeah what
people think that high school is like I
know the time to shine and it's not if
