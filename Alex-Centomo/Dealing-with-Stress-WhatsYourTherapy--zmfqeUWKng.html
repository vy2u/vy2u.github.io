crazy today I'm trying out something new
so let me know if you guys like this
look down in the comments below but
today I want to talk about something a
little bit different so as you guys know
coming with the school months back to
school season is a little stressful for
a lot of people and even if you're not
in school going back to work after a
nice summer off or summer vacation even
if you just get two weeks off starting
back at something can always be a little
bit stressful starting somewhere new can
be stressful there's a lot of stresses
that go on in life and a lot of you guys
have questions for me about how I deal
with that sort of stress so a little
background story I have suffered from a
pretty severe anxiety and panic disorder
for a long time and you know things that
wouldn't be stressful to most people are
stressful for me and there are just many
things that play into that so I want to
kind of just come up with ways I find or
more therapeutic to get over those
dresses and you know stick on a positive
note and to be able to deal with all of
those everyday things that you don't
want to deal with and you'd rather just
like the in bed watching Netflix we
can't all live our lives like that no
matter how much we want to we do have to
be involved in the social norm and do
our part in society to be able to live
this video is a part of the hashtag
what's your therapy tag video and it's
part of the web therapy series that will
be rearing on Showtime again and I know
that stylehaul is going to be having a
web therapy kind of like series thing on
their channel so I thought it was a
great opportunity to kind of just talk
about things that are like my therapy
and I'm also interested in hearing
things that you guys do better kind of
could be like what your therapy is
because I'm always searching for ways to
kind of get my mind off of things when
it's you know getting a bit too much i
like to keep very positive i like
keeping positive people in my life I
like being happy I like laughing I like
smiling so anything that's gonna make me
feel that way I'm definitely open to
things that I find doing when I'm
anxious or having a lot of stress is
just to kind of get my lined off of
whatever I'm doing so for me it would be
going to YouTube I love watching youtube
videos I find it very therapy
for me select things that are like my
therapy that I don't need to see a
therapist for obviously it's just like
kind of coming home from school or from
work if you have a stressful day just
kind of curling up on the couch or in
bed just watching a few YouTube videos
to get my mind distracted before I do
anything else like homework or other
work or anything else I have to do for
that day I just find you know getting
lost in someone else's life for a bit is
very therapeutic for me that's why I
love daily vlogging so much will not me
but I love watching daily blog so much
because it kind of just like it's a
short escape from reality and then all
obviously you get to know the people
really well and you feel connected to
them but I just find that you know
getting your mind off of things is very
important especially if you are stressed
about something or feeling anxious or
whatever you might be feeling another
thing would be probably like going for a
walk so I love going for long walks I
love nature I love bringing my dogs for
walks I have two dogs they're super
awkward and different but I love them so
much and I like taking them on walks to
kind of clear my head they're so cute
another thing which may seem weird to a
lot of people but I love to do my makeup
in hair I find it very relaxing so and i
also get really excited to do different
looks and stuff so what I'm like in that
state of like putting my foundation on
and putting my like eyebrows and
everything doing all that kind of stuff
liquid eyeliner you know gotta
concentrate on that it really gets your
mind off of anything that you're
worrying about so I just think that
there are many things in life that are
kind of like could be your therapy when
it comes to everyday stresses so YouTube
videos for me especially vlogging going
for walks taking my dog for a walk you
know doing my hair and makeup also I'm
starting to take up cooking a little bit
I am a pretty crappy cook to be honest
like I'm I'm real I'm bad okay I'm
really bad but my boyfriend loves
cooking and he has been teaching me a
few things so I'm excited to start
learning more and I just find that doing
something with someone when they really
enjoy it it helps you become happy too
that's something that I just really find
works doing things with someone that you
care about or even a friend apparent
whatever they like to do ask them to
join I'm sure they would love to have a
partner and to teach i know for me i
love like showing people what i do and
doing things to make other people happy
makes me very happy anything i find for
me is playing guitar and piano even
though i'm not like amazing at them I do
love playing them I love learning new
songs and teaching myself different
things if I'm feeling very down or
whatever i'll go and like play a few
songs and just get into the mindset of
you know the music and it just really
helps me a lot instead of letting that
negative energy control you and tell you
what to do and how to think and you know
get you all negative and upset you could
choose to be happy i know shaycarl
always says happiness is a choice and i
really believe that because i do find
happiness is a choice you could choose
to be happy and no matter what
circumstance it is you could choose
happiness you can find something in
every single day that will make you
happy no matter what it is even if it's
just a sunset or something that you just
in that moment think like wow you can
just appreciate it then anything like
that if you make you happy enough I
think you're going to go around being
negative then that's a bad way to think
because you're not living life to
fullest stepping outside your comfort
zone being happy are like the two main
ingredients to life in my opinion I feel
like this video is very different from
videos that I normally do I like to once
in a while do advice videos and stuff
like that if you're interested in seeing
more of these types of videos let me
know in the comments below or if you'd
rather me do this on my blogging channel

think of that filming videos for you

videos I love editing videos I love
taking pictures editing pictures I just
love all that stuff how did I forget
that seriously guys this right now what
I'm doing is therapy for me it's making
me feel happy it's making me feel good
and I get to talk to all of you even
though I'm honestly just talking to my
camera I know that
if you guys are going to be watching
this and I do feel like we're all
friends and we're all connected and that
just makes me super happy I love talking
to you guys so if you're interested in
