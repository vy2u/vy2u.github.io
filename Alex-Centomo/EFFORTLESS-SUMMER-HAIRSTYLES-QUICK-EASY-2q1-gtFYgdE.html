channel I'm in such a good mood right
now
just because I just got back from Italy
I'm feeling really excited to be back
into my own house don't get me wrong I
absolutely loved Italy I had the best
time traveling for the past few months
but it feels so good to be home and
actually be in my space doing my own
schedule getting back to business
organizing my birthday coming up
organizing my wedding I'm just so happy
so in today's video I'm going to be
doing three different hairstyles that
are perfect for the summertime that are
my favorites and I feel like I want to
share them with you so that maybe these
could be some of your favorites as well
these are very effortless looks and they
would look good with most events that
you have going on this summer this video
is in collaboration with l'oreal canada
so thank you so much for partnering with
me on this video so i can share with you
guys some of my tips and tricks they did
come out with new hair products that i
have been testing them out for a while
now and i actually use them every single
day that i do my hair i travel with them
so I figured why not show you guys them
as well comment down below whether or
not you think I should cut my hair or
let it keep growing you guys know I've
had long hair for so long but I've also
had short hair in my life so I don't
know if you are new here make sure to
hit that subscribe button down below and
turn on those post notifications for all
the time so you guys never miss the
video and give this video a thumbs up if
you guys want to see some more fun
videos okay I'm just like really hyper
in a good mood so let's get started so
as you can see my hair is like I guess
80% dry it's still damp and the first
thing I'm going to be using is this
product right here which smells so good
this is the L'Oreal stylist ed defining
spray and this adds shape and balance
and a great thing about this is that you
spray it on to damp hair and you style
it with your fingers and it just leaves
your curls looking amazing so if you
have natural curls this stuff is great
for you mmm it smells so sweet it's
really nice so it does create some
bouncy defined curls that lasts all day
which is really nice and you can already
see a difference from this side versus
this side it's alcohol free there's no
sulfates and the goji berry extract just
makes everything that much better so you
have some like bouncy defined curls that
last all day
yeah do the other side now that's so
nice I'm going to add a little bit more
to my roots so I want the curls to be up
here too and not just like straight and
and curly okay guys so I gave some time
for my hair to dry completely it looks
so good like these are all natural curls
that I just did with my fingers the
formula of this product actually lets
you kind of sculpt your hair so what I
did was I like twisted this piece around
like this with the product in it and
then just like it worked but it's not
waxy does it feel gross or anything it
just goes a really natural curly look
and it's not too extreme and I just
really liked the way it makes my hair
look super effortless and natural and
that's one of my favorite looks for the
summer for these second hairstyle you
can actually play off the first one or
my sea salt waves I like to make my hair
a lot more textured now the first
product does add texture to your hair
that's for sure because you're able to
sculpt it but typically when I use the
next product I will actually just have
my hair completely out of the shower
like I normally did or it'll be kind of
like second day hair after my hair has
already been curled with a curling wand
and I will go in with this to make it
look more beachy you know when you curl
your hair and then you go to bed and the
next day they're almost like kind of out
but if you add sea salt spray to it it
actually makes your hairstyle look like
a completely new hairstyle so I'm just
gonna show you what I would do now that
my hair is completely dry because this
product is meant to be put on dry hair
so this is the stylist net texturizing
mist its sunkissed waves with windswept
body it does add 24 hour beach waves
without that like crunchy feeling which
I really like because there's nothing
that I hate more than like crunch
actually brought this with me when I
went to Italy because there's like a
little clamp that you can lock it in
place so that you can't squirt it so
that it's actually really easy to travel
with and I like the smell of it a lot it
does have salt infusion in it it's
silicone free it's a non drying formula
so all you really need to do is like
mist it onto your dry hair and scrunch
it's as simple as that it smells so good
like these are nice beach waves to be
completely honest when I go to the beach
this is what my hair looks like when I
got on the water
I don't live near a beach I live in
Montreal Canada we do not have beaches
here so I do not get to experience that
but when I travel I love the way my hair
looks naturally so I'm so happy I can
like achieve this look with these
products because it's my favorite way to
have my hair absolutely favorite I love
it okay guys we're back for the third
hairstyle I just let my hair in the
shower like I use the shower head so if
I have like water splotches anywhere
that's why for this next style the
reason why I agree what my hair is
because I'm doing a sleek look once in a
while if especially if I'm going out to
like an event or something I love to
have a really slick back sleek look with
straight hair and it's very different
for me and that's why I like doing it
because typical Alex just has her hair
as curls so I'm just using a wet brush
to go through my hair to detangle it the
next product I'm gonna be using is this
one and this is this L'Oreal stylist of
smoothing serum and this gives 24 hour
complete first control which is great
when you're going for a sleek look you
don't want any of that frizz no thank
you
so this actually has a sigh berry
extract which smells so good I think out
of all of them this is the best smelling
one in my opinion what you do is you
just apply it onto your hair I mean I'm
going to show you in a second make sure
your hair is damn it's also not greasy
and it's silicone free which I like as
well and again there's a little lock on
top so you can actually travel with it
which is great I do about two pumps then
you just smooth it onto your damp hair
you can actually get quite close to the
roots because it is non greasy so that's
great
smells so yummy make sure you get the
back as well because I always tend to
forget and if you're wondering what
these like things are on my arm I was
attacked by bugs in Italy it was great
and then it always makes sure to really
get the front pieces cuz all around my
face is what's what gets really it
frizzy I guess it's because I sweat
there I'm
really sure but these ones typically get
the most Rosie dryer
okay so this after blow-drying if you
guys have curly hair you can relate that
usually blow-drying curly hair makes a
triangle but using that smoothing serum
actually really helped there's obviously
still a few curls but that's why I like
to go over this with a straightener I
just take a flat iron and go over it
just to make it even more but it
shouldn't take long because as you can
tell your hair is already quite sleek
but except for these pieces underneath
super curly area
so this is the third look I mean
obviously you could just wear your hair
straight but my favorite thing to do and
this is why I like to wear my hair like
this is to actually sleek it back into a
little low pony with an elastic clear
elastic
and I see girls wearing their hair like
this all the time I think it looks so
nice as you can see I didn't have to add
anything other than this and my hair is
super sleek back pull around to one side
and there you have it I love I think
because of how different this hairstyle
is it might be my favorite but curly
it's just always my thing because of a
natural curly girl I'm gonna be having a
link to all of these products in the
description box they actually just
recently came out and that's why I'm
talking about them there's also this one
which is like a heat protectant primer
which is really awesome and then there's
a pod one which I actually don't I
haven't tried that one out yet but these
four I've tried I love them okay guys
