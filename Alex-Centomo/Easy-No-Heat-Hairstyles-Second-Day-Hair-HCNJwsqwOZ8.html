channel today I'm going to be showing
you some hairstyles that I've been
loving lately I always kind of
experiment with different hairstyles
basically what I do is I go on Pinterest
and I literally search braids or
bohemian braids or boho hairstyles and
then I look at all the pictures and I
recreate them myself
and sometimes I change things up
sometimes I don't but it's all kind of
like what I like about it and of course
on snapchat and on Instagram when I post
pictures wearing those hairstyles I get
a lot of questions about how I do them
and stuff and I always feel bad about
doing tutorials because it's not like I
don't create these hairstyles but a lot
of you guys are interested in seeing how
I do them so these are just a few fun
things that I've been doing lately
and before I get into the video I also
just want to say that recently I went
into the store Aveda in the mall near
where I live they just opened one up and
I went in there with the intention of
getting just a dry shampoo and left with
a few other things I love their products
so much like I didn't know this so the
people that work there are very into
like they just really like to like teach
you about the company and the brand and
about the products and they actually did
this thing which is kind of gross but
they did like a scalp picture of my
scalp basically and it was a kazoom up
to compare like what kind of scalp I had
it was so gross guys oh my god like
flaky but anyways um without further ado
I'm just going to get started into the
tour in the tutorial using some of my
favorite products so as you can see my
hair is super greasy because I've been
washed in like four days so I'm using
the Aveda shampoo dry shampoo and I love
this stuff because it instantly revives
your hair with a 99.8% naturally derived
non-aerosol powder mists that refreshes
hair and rejuvenates your style so it
just looks very natural and light it
doesn't make your head itch E or feel
really gross it's great because the
natural powders absorb excess oils
lifting them away from the hair and it
saves me so much time between shampooing
so this hairstyle is very simple you're
just going to part your hair in the
middle like you would a net arm it like
you would a regular braid and then
you're just going to start fishtailing
and also I want to say before which I
forgot bit of data stores and salons
will be offering a free dry shampoo
experience to revive your style which
allows you to experience the product so
you can click the link in the
description to check out all the details
but basically what I'm doing in this is
just fishtailing my hair so just normal
fishtail and then what you're going to
do is separate your hair into three
sections and start braiding normally
this kind of confusing and doesn't
really look different except adds extra
volume and kind of adds a twist to the
braid so it's a little confusing but I'm
sure you'll get the hang of it after a
while it's just very simple to do and in
the end makes your braid look a lot
thicker and gives it a different kind of
twist than the average braid so as you
can see here I just have the three
strands braiding them over and then
separating that again to continue
fishtailing and once you are done you're
fishtailing and you secure the braid
with a clear elastic you're going to
begin to pull out the braid you don't
have to but I really like this look
especially the the whole like little
braids I didn't in there makes it look a
lot thicker and bigger and I just love
the way that this looks in my hair and
it gives something a bit different to
the natural or original braid that you
would just do by three strand do the
same thing on the other side and I just
I think it's so cute and I wear it out
all the time
for this next hairstyle it's something
very simple so all you need to do is
take two strands that are right next to
your face that basically frame your face
they can be any size you want I'm taking
around maybe three quarters of an inch
and then taking another section that's
kind of in-between the back of your hair
and the section of your face you're just
going to regular braid that and then
pull it out and secure it with a clear
elastic and then you're going to take
those two strands and basically just
bobby pin them behind this is a super
simple hairstyle I literally do this all
the time for any kind of meeting that I
have or even just going downtown going
for lunch and I'm taking this air
control air spray which is amazing from
Aveda again and I'm using this all over
my hair it's like a light hold hairspray
and you can actually just brush your
hair afterwards it's awesome and does
not feel crunchy or disgusting in your
hair this next hairstyle calls from some
texture so I'm using the Aveda light
element texturizing cream and I just rub
this through my hands and then apply
this to the ends of my hair try not to
focus it too much near the roots but
really focus it on the bottom and then
you are going to bring all your hair to
one side you can actually leave your
hair just like this I think it looks so
nice it's like very messy and bedhead
and I actually wear my hair like this
almost all the time it's just natural
but for this look I'm going to be
grabbing a section on top of my head so
around your temples and then pulling it
up and making a very very messy bun like
as messy as you can get so I'm just
grabbing my hair and then kind of just
placing it in a position that I like and
that's all I do and it's super simple
and easy and look so cute
