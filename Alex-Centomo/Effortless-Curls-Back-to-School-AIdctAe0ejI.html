like it's been a while since I've
actually just sat down and spoken to you
guys and done like a good old hair
tutorial remember my old videos and I
used to just do a bunch of hair
tutorials like I miss doing that and I
woke up this morning I went for a run I
showered and this is what came out of my
hair this is one of my natural hair
letting it air dry like a big poop and I
just really want to do a hair tutorial
and I know a lot of you guys are going
back to school you know dare I say it's
sad but to be honest I'm kind of down
for fall weather I love fall I love
sweater weather I'm so excited for fall
time I'm not in school but I know a lot
of you guys are and when I was going
back to school especially I always
wanted to do my hair but the first day
or for like picture day or something I
always want to have nice hair and in
high school I did not know how to do my
hair like even my mom sometimes would
straighten my hair and like I did not
know what I was doing so YouTube did not
exist when I was in high school so I'm
so jealous of you guys I feel like I
would have been like so good in high
school if I had YouTube back then but I
wanted to do a simple effortless like
wave curl tutorial for you guys to use
for like back-to-school or picture day
something that's quick and easy that you
can do right before going it's not gonna
take too long obviously and that's
really easy for you guys to do because I
know my hair tutorials sometimes are
very complicated like a lot of you guys
stay with my straightener when I curl my
hair like a lot of you guys aren't
getting it but don't worry because I
found a simple answer for you that's
gonna make your hair beautiful and not
take long and it's super simple recently
I came across this product and I was
sent this product but I actually really
really liked it before I Pro anything I
always test it out and see it's
something I would actually use and I
tested it out when I was like holy crap
I need to show my viewers this because
like this is so simple and I don't know
it just gives me like really natural
curls as you know I haven't really been
styling my hair in the summer but when
it's back-to-school season
I love to stop my hair I just love to do
it so this is what it is this is the
kiss instawave I know like probably you
guys are all like what the hell it's a
very simple easy to use tool so it looks
like this I'm sure you guys have seen
tutorials on this or something similar
it's just so simple so I'm just gonna
get right into it the first thing you
see on it it's just like a stick with
like spiky things that seem to turn and
then you have an a button here with
arrows that goes left or right and then
you have the on button and off button
but it goes low and high and I think it
goes up to 425 degrees Fahrenheit or 450
I'm not a hundred percent sure but I
usually just do it on the high one
because it just I don't like leave my
hair long I don't know if you know what
I mean I'm just gonna show you guys how
it works cuz it's awesome but before I
do that got a lot of heat up so I'm just
putting it on too high as you can see
the red button goes on and I'm just
gonna let it sit for like 30 seconds
before I start doing my hair so what's
really cool about this it's starting to
heat up now I can feel it but the button
here that goes left and right it's like
it alternates directions so you can kind
of figure out where you want your
clothes to go with just a button which
is super simple it also automatically
turns off at 90 minutes so you know
those times you're like leaving the
house and you're like oh my gosh should
I turn off my curling iron oh my gosh
they're Trauma off my straightener like
I know that's really bad but it's
happened to me a few times and this
one's like no worries not that you
shouldn't turn it off because you should
but just in case you have those moments
out and about you could just be like
it's okay automatically turns off no
worries whoo but still turn it off also
I like this because it you'll see in my
video like you can use any hand you can
go any direction it's like super simple
it's tangle free like these block your
head so you can't burn your head which
is very important for me because I
always burn myself it's weird
so it's fully automatic tangle free all
that kind of stuff all that jazz I'm
just gonna get onto the tutorial because
I feel like my intros are way too long
so when I curl my hair I always do the
front pieces that are around my face
they go away from my face because I find
that look gives you more of like a
windblown look that when curls go into
your face it's not as flattering it's a
personal preference you guys can do
whatever you guys like but for this I'm
gonna go away from my face and then a
lot of people can't
you the same curl throughout like that
side of their hair so if they're gonna
go this way they'll always curl that way
and that gives a beautiful like simple
wave love my sister loves doing that but
I like more beachy texturized looks like
messy kind of effortless almost like
natural curls so I'm gonna do that
because that's just my favorite but it's
up to you oh look the blue light went on
I don't even know if you guys can see
that but so this section of hair you
take should be around like not too thick
because it's not gonna like curls good
but I take around I don't know what is
this like an inch so then what you're
gonna do is you're gonna place it like
around the barrel through the little
like loopy thing and then like any or
close your head and then you're gonna
start curling and going down like that
then I pull out and I have this really
really simple effortless wave it's great
because you can like figure out how
tight you want the curl to be by how
long you leave it on I wouldn't leave it
on past 15 seconds because you don't
want to like burn off your hair like in
that one video do you guys remember that
girl like but I like really really loose
curls that's my thing my go-to look my
hair doesn't fall out that much when it
comes to curls I heard I hold curls very
well in my hair so I can do this and
it'll stay whereas if you find your hair
kind of falls out a little bit I would
go tighter and then let it fall if you
know what it means so this is the piece
of manager next it's a little like dead
piece I have it in front of my ear I'm
gonna place it you you can place it near
the mid or the top I kind of place it
more in between the both and then it's
cool because this catches it
hold it pull it out a little so I'll do
a bigger piece for you guys to see also
you want to hold the instawave
vertically not like this or like this or
whatever just so you can see what you're
doing so I place it in and you guys see
that I'm placing it in between and then
I am wrapping it doing the top leaving a
little bit out pulling it down doing the
bottom pulling it out so you can see the
beautiful curls okay and now if I wanted
to do an opposite section because what I
usually do on both sides is I'll do like
one strand away once trend towards away
towards I'll kind of mix and match and
then the sizes of the pieces I'm using
two are all different so nothing is
uniform that's like my go-to thing okay
so then for the opposite way you're
gonna do the same thing except place it
the opposite way so you know how before
it was going this way now I'm gonna go
this way
if that makes sense and then we're gonna
spin the opposite way whoa it's taking
me long in this tutorial just cuz I'm
trying to show you guys but this
literally takes me like two seconds also
another good tip if you want warm like
the curl on top you could start more
near your roots
I like straighter on top and then curly
on the bottom if that makes sense point
out is that if you do have longer hair
you'll probably have to do like me where
you do like one section at time verse if
you have shorter hair it's gonna take
you literally two seconds so all of you
girls complaining that you don't have
long hair this is probably one of those
times where it's best to not have long
hair
it just like grips on to it how cool is
that look at that curl whoa and you're
it's in for like five seconds like
that's insane I'm gonna do the rest of
my hair and I'll be back with the end
result so once all the curls are
complete you turn off the curling iron
first step as you can see there's still
a little bit of more like the ribbon
curls which are nice if you guys like
this you could stay keep it like that
but I like to have more of like the
beach eNOS so I gently just run my
fingers through the curls don't brush
them you just run your fingers through
them like this sometimes I'll go a
little like head width like and then
back give it some volume see this just
looks more natural now and then for the
final step that I do is texture spray so
you can use any texture spray you want
sea salt or texture spray
I like doing it at the ends
and see because I went out around my
face the curls go like this
so you can actually place them like I
don't explain it really like this look
it looks naturally fine like it just
looks like this is your hair if I'm not
filming you try to explain what I'm
doing that takes me five minutes to my
hair so if you are in a rush or whatever
this would be perfect because it's
tangle free
you can literally like I showed you just
place it and it just spins it for you it
won't get caught it won't like break
your hair it's really good it's fast
it's easy that's why I think it's like a
perfect item for like school like school
time because you know obviously you want
to sleep in as much as you can for
school time yeah I really really like it
I'll have a link for the product in the
description box down below if you guys
are interested to check it out when I
use products there's a lot of times guys
that like companies will send me stuff
and I won't really enjoy it so I'm not
gonna talk about it but this I really
feel like it's beneficial for you guys
because I get so many questions on like
how I do my hair and stuff this is
literally how I would do my hair if I
was still in my school this is how I
would do my hair for back to school and
then if you want slidepark middle part
that's up to you you can do like little
hairstyles like you can bring this back
a little make it more bohemian you can
have it like on one side like this you
can have little braids you could do
whatever you like personally for me for
back to school I used to like to have my
hair on both sides but with a side part
and I would look this way like where my
side part was so I wouldn't go where all
my hair was covering my face I'd go the
opposite way like this I know I do a
little smile so yeah I hope you guys
enjoyed this tutorial I know I get so
many questions on doing hair tutorials

just feel like they're so simple and
like easy to do when I feel like there's
a million hair tutorials on YouTube but
