be a little crazy for you guys right now
because I never wear my makeup like this
but I decided that I wanted to do
something a little different and lately
I have been rewatching the series called
skins it is a British television show I
think actually no I don't think I know
that they came to America I mean they
made an American version I think only
one season I didn't do so well but I
just really really enjoyed the British
version I watched a couple years ago and
then decided to rewatch it and I think
it's just amazing so you guys should
definitely check that out but I decided
to do a Effy Stonem makeup tutorial
right now and she is awesome she's by
far my favorite character
she's very rebellious and gothic and
she's a very complex character so what I
really like about her look is that it's
very dark around the eyes but you know
she keeps it neutral everywhere else so
she doesn't normally wear blush her lips
are very neutral it's just a very deep
dark smoky eye which I thought it looked
beautiful and she has very very blue
eyes so it's it really helps them pop so
yeah if you guys are interested in
seeing how I did this crazy dark makeup
look then just keep on watching okay so
I'm starting off with my NARS primer and
I'm just going to be applying this all
over my eyelid and focusing it up
towards my brow and then underneath my
eye just to prepare my eye for the
shadows next using my Maybelline Color
tattoo in tough as taupe I'm going to be
applying this as a base before I apply
any dark color to my eyelid just so that
the color stays more vibrant and dark on
my eye
next taking the color black out from my
Urban Decay Naked 2 palette I'm going to
be padding this all over my eyelid and
then bringing it up towards the crease
and I'm also going to be applying this
in the outer corner making a kind of
v-shape so that way it looks more of a
smokey eye and it just looks really deep
and dark
I like this color a lot because it's
kind of a blue with gray undertone and
it's a bit shimmery it's very similar
similar to the color that Effie wears on
the show I'm then going to be using my
Mac eyeshadow in print I'm going to be
applying this to the outer corner and
into my crease just to soften up the
look and to blend it out a bit more so
it doesn't look too harsh
and then taking that black out color
again I'm going to be applying this
underneath my eye instead of an eyeliner
just so it brings down the color a bit
more and makes your eye have that deeper
more dramatic smokey eye and then I'm
just gonna be blending out the bottom
line as well so that the line is not too
harsh now taking my Maybelline master
precise eyeliner I'm gonna be applying
this to my upper lash line actually I'm
just gonna be applying this everywhere
so my upper lash line my tight line my
waterline the inner corner just really
deepen up the look don't worry about
making it perfect try to make it as
messy as you can because fbi√≠s look is
very messy all the time and I'm winging
it out just a little bit because that's
normally how she wears it so you can see
I'm just putting it onto my tight line
and then my waterline and just being
very messy with it and sorry I look a
little creepy right there but this is
very similar to the way that Effie wears
it on the show and then I'm just taking
that black out color again with an
angled brush and I'm pushing it into the
lash line where I applied the liquid
liner just so that the color stays on
all day
taking the color foxy from the Urban
Decay Naked palette too I'm going to be
applying this underneath my brow to help
soften up the look then curling my
lashes I'm going to be applying the
Maybelline rocket volume express mascara
to the upper and lower lashes at these
eyelashes are not perfect they're very
clumpy and messy so that's why I chose
this mascara just because it does clump
up your lashes a little bit and make
them look really full and thick
and then taking a small amount of my
Laguna bronzer by NARS I'm going to be
applying this into the hollows of my
cheekbones just to contour my face
because Eppie does have a very slim face
and very defined cheekbones
I am then going to be taking my
foundation brush just to start blending
all the lines together so it's not too
harsh
and then lastly finishing off with my
Mac lipstick in innocents beware as the
nude lipstick
