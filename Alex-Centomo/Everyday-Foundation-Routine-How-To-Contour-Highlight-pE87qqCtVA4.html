everyday foundation tutorial for you
guys it's been a much requested video
I've been getting a lot of inboxes
asking how I do my foundation and even
though I have done my foundation in
previous videos I've never really
explained why are you certain products
and just everything about the face and
you know like I've what I find really
good in certain products and you know
difference between drugstore and
high-end and whatever so this is just
going to go into detail and it's kind of
a glowy youthful look so it's perfect
for any age category you can be young
and wear this you can be older and wear
this because it really helps give you
like a youthful glow and I just really
really like it so this is the look by
the way this video is also going to be
kind of a how to contour and highlight
your face which is just going to give
really nice dimension to your face and
especially for girls that have more
around your face like me I love
contouring because it does give a really
slim look to your face so yeah if you're
interested in seeing how i did this look
then just keep on watching so the first
step I like to do after washing and
moisturizing is apply primer and my
favorite at the moment is just this
smashed Smashbox photo finish light I
always have a hard time saying Smashbox
for some reason but yeah it's just this
photo finish light oil free face primer
and what I do is I just put a little bit
on my finger tips like this and then I
rub it in and I apply it all over my
face so cheeks my forehead my nose and
underneath my chin I'm you don't really
want to rub in primer you wanna more
just spread it out evenly across your
face and what primer does is it helps
make your foundation go on smoother and
more like an airbrushed finish and since
this helps minimize your pores it's like
a kind of blocks or pores but on a bad
way it just makes it so smooth that way
your foundation goes on smoother instead
of you know being all bumpy and cakey
and stuff yeah just it's just a really
good primer and I really would recommend
it if you do have oily skin because it
really helped
modify your skin throughout the whole
day I'm not even kidding it's awesome
and then afterwards I like to use my
Urban Decay d slick makeup setting spray
so this kind of works as a primer as
well but this just really helps protect
keeping your foundation and bronzer and
blush and stuff from sliding throughout
the day I don't know about you guys but
a lot of times if i'll apply makeup it
looks really good for like you know
first couple hours and by the end of the
day I just feel like it's just all
coming off my face and yeah this just
really helps so what you want to do is
you just shake it and then you're going
to hold it away from your face close
your eyes in your mouth well I've got
some in my mouth oh that is not taste
good but yeah you just want to let this
dry so I'm just going to do this and you
apply this before you put any foundation
on your face and then after you put your
foundation on your concealer so that it
just really helps keep your foundation
from sliding throughout the day I really
find it works really really well I've
noticed a huge difference after I've
used this like I swear by it every
single day next what I like to do is use
my foundation I've used like so many
foundations in the past honestly I've
gone through like so many different
products to lick all use drugstore then
I'll use high end and honestly right now
I'm loving drugstore foundation again
for I guess maybe a year and a half i
was using using the Make Up For Ever HD
foundation I thought that was really
really good but this works almost like
the exact same way and it is way cheaper
like half the price and I just really
like it is the Revlon Colorstay and this
is in the color 220 natural beige and I
just find its matches me really really
well and this is also a full coverage
foundation like as you can see I have
blemishes on my forehead just because
that happens I do have oily skin and
depending on you know what I eat or if
it's that time of month i will get
blemishes i do not have perfect skin and
it sucks but that's why i really like
using this because it really helps give
a full coverage and
I mean you don't need a ball I'd like a
little goes a long way and this also
sticks to your face I could just hugs it
I love that about this foundation so
what I do with this is I top off a
little bit onto the back of my wrist
just like that with the foundation I'd
like to apply foundation before I apply
concealer some people prefer the other
way but just me personally I'd like to
put foundation before concealer because
it just works better for me but then
using my Sigma flat kabuki f20 brush
does no f80 brush sorry I'm just going
to dab that into my foundation so what I
like to do is I start stippling on to my
face just to make sure it gets
everywhere by the way if I'm looking
over here just because I have a mirror
so I could see what I'm doing oh yeah I
stipple it first and make sure it gets
everywhere and then I start buffing it
in and this will just really help give
me that airbrushed look I mean you could
see right away I'm not even blending it
in and I'm just stippling it on it
already it's covering up my blemishes I
also like to bring the foundation onto
my ear just because you want to blend it
and one of the most important things but
you do when you're applying foundation
is you want to bring it down your neck
just like this because I mean I see it
so so many girls would like really nice
foundation but then they have that wine
like this or the difference between like
the foundation in their neck because
this color matches the color of the rest
of my body and my face is normally a lot
lighter than the rest of my body and so
is my neck just because it never hits
sunlight ever so bringing down your
foundation is really important just so
it gets all blended and you know evens
out your complexion and it doesn't look
as fake so the next thing I like to do
is apply my concealer after the
foundation and I just like to use this
mac prolongwear concealer and this is in
the color NC 20 I like to use just a
little dot like this on my hand very
small amount add some people like to
apply it with a concealer brush but I
just like to use my fingers just because
personally I find the warm
your fingers really gets it into the
skin and you can really blend it better
so I take it with my ring finger and I
start applying it to my blemishes around
my nose because every woman gets redness
there around my mouth same thing and
then I also like to apply this
underneath my eyes because I just find
it really really conceals well I don't
really find it creases or anything like
that and I don't really deal a lot with
you know dark circles or bags just
because I have really small eyes so for
me this stuff just works really really
really well I use my ring finger just
because it's a lot more gentle than my
other fingers like when you apply with
your middle finger your your pointer
finger you were putting more pressure
and rubbing more you can create
premature wrinkles so I like to use my
ring finger just to get more of a gentle
touch so after I apply my foundation and
concealer I like to use my Urban Decay d
slick setting spray once more just the
same way that I did it previously so
it's going to hold it away and spray but
yeah this just really helps set your
foundation and it's just going to stick
all day long and I mean stick to the
point where you can hug somebody or you
know rub your face up against something
and it's your foundation is not going to
come off its going to stay then I like
to set my foundation again but with a
powder this time just because my skin
does get a little oily so I like to put
some powder just to set it and modify my
face and like my t-zone area because
that's just really oily for me I just
need like to use my makeup forever
translucent powder as you can see i am
almost out of this i use it so often
it's just an amazing product though and
then i'll use my mac 182 kabuki brush
and this brush is awesome for setting
foundation so I like to dab on my face
okay so now let's move on to contouring
so I will just take my favorite bronzer
which is my NARS Laguna bronzer it's
just in this package of this typical
NARS packaging and I like to take my
sigma small contour fo5 brush it's
really small and it's perfect for
contouring you want to start off with
your cheekbones you're going to start
around where your hairline ends and
where your ear is and you're going to
bring that down and the hollows of your
cheeks towards your mouth so you're
going to suck in like this i know it's
going to look funny but you're going to
suck in take a little bit of product at
a time really don't start off with a lot
because you can always build on it or is
if you put a lot of makeup on it first
you can't really take it away afterwards
as you can see it's giving some
dimension to my face and then it's the
same thing i start on my temples this
time you want to make sure you're
getting it into your hairline because
you don't want it to be like foundation
bronzer and then like a line and then
you have like your hair you want to make
sure that's all blended together so that
way it looks more natural and then again
you're going to be taking this below
your John like this underneath and the
last place you want to contour is the
sides of your nose and this is not to
make your nose look you know small or
anything it just to add dimension to
your face so it doesn't look so like
flat I will go on with blush and my
absolute favorite blush at the moment is
my NARS orgasm blush but it is broken I
shown this in a previous video it's like
this it's a really nice coralie gold
pink is so I tap off the excess you're
going to smile to find your apples and
just apply it right onto your apples of
your cheeks and bring it up towards your
temples so and then I will go in with a
highlighter and highlighter is really
important when you're doing contouring
because you contour your face but then
you also need to highlight it to really
finish off a dimensional look I like to
use my mac mineralize skinfinish in
and gentle it's just a really nice
bronzy pearly color and I apply this
with my finger actually you can apply
this with any brush but I like to apply
with my finger and then you're going to
apply it to the top of your cheekbone
and bring it up and then you want to
bring it down the bridge of your nose
since you did contour the sides you want
to highlight the middle a little bit on
your forehead right here on your chin
and then I like to put a bit on my
Cupid's bow which is just the lip at the
top of the lip that like kind of goes
down and like an M shape just like that
because it makes your lips appear a lot
fuller then moving on to eyes I will
normally just do my eyebrows they're so
my eyebrows I've done next up I like to
do is normally on an everyday foundation
like I don't really like to our eye
shadow but I found a really good trip
that I'll show you guys in a second so
before I put anything on my islands I
like to prime my eyelids just so that
whatever you're putting on top it does
increase and it doesn't you know mix
around and melt off your face throughout
the day so I like to use this NARS I
primer it's amazing I have really oily
eyelids so I actually found this through
missglamorazzi here on youtube I will
link her child down below she's awesome
I love her videos but yeah she also has
really oily eyelids and she uses this
and she said it was amazing so I decided
to try it out and I absolutely loved it
so I just apply this to my eyelid bring
it up words and then i use my ring
finger to just blended in so lately
instead of eyeshadow i've been loving to
use this benefit high beam and this is
actually a highlighter in liquid form
and it kind of looks like a nail polish
bottle but it's actually a highlighter
and you would apply this the same way I
applied my mac mineralize skinfinish to
like you know your cheekbones and the
bridge of your nose or whatnot but I
actually have like putting this on my
eyelids lately I don't know why but it
gives a really nice glowy look so I just
applied
a little bit to my eyelid and then I
will blend that out and the thing is
this just gives a really natural
youthful glow to your eyelid so it
doesn't look like you're wearing too
much makeup but it does give a really
nice Sheen to it the last step I do is
apply mascara and I'm obviously going to
use my favorite which is benefit they're
real you can curl your eyelashes
actually i recommend you curl your
eyelashes but my eyelashes are already
really curly so i don't need to do that
step but curling your eyelashes really
opens up your eyes a lot I don't want to
use a lot just for an everyday look but
I do find that my makeup doesn't feel
complete without mascara and then I mean
you can put any lip color you want to
put on for me today I'm just going to be
using my EOS lip balm because I don't
feel like I need any color to my lips
and that is the finished look so as you
can see it's just really glowy and
youthful and really really really nice I
really like writing this as an everyday
look sometimes I won't put blush but i
figured for the video i would show you
how to apply blush after your contouring
and highlighting so yeah this is the
finished look I hope you guys enjoyed it
