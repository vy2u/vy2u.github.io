here today with my little cousin Sophia
hi and we decided to do a makeup hair
and outfit kind of look today for any 13
year old girl who wants to wear makeup
at school but isn't really sure what
kind of makeup to wear so they're just
starting to experiment and obviously 13
year-olds you don't need to wear makeup
but if you were trying this really
simple look is perfect for any day at
school or at your friend's house or
anything like that so if you're just
students seeing how we did this look
then just keep on watching so starting
off with my Smashbox primer I'm going to
be applying this all over her face and
it's just going to help control the oils
on her face for the day
then taking my Revlon Photoready BB
cream in light which has SPF 30 in it
I'm going to dot this on her face and
then blend it out and this just works
really well as a tinted moisturizer I
don't really want to use foundation on
her skin since she is very young but
this gives her small amount of coverage
while blending out and giving her an
even skin tone
then using my Maybelline cover stick in
ivory I'm going to just cover up any
redness that she has on her face
now I'm taking my Revlon nearly naked
powder I'm going to use this to set the
makeup and mattify her face
I like to use bronzer on the eyelid to
give the eye a really nice nude look
which is perfect for an everyday wear
I like to use a shimmery ivory or pearl
color just to the top of where the pupil
is on the lid which gives it a pop of
something and then I'm going to do one
coat of the falsies mascara by
Maybelline
a weird trick I found is when you're out
of blush to take a shimmery pink
eyeshadow and use that and this just
gives more of a subtle look to the
cheeks
you
I like to use Revlon lip butters because
they moisturize your lips and keep them
hydrated throughout the whole day and
don't give that much color so they are
wearable for an everyday look
you
now taking my chi hair protectant spray
I'm just going to spray this on to each
section before I put any heat because it
helps protect the hair and not let it
break when you're applying heat onto it
you
I'm just twisting the hair around the
straightener to give it a really nice
curl
now I'm just going to twist a section of
her hair up and pin it back and pull
that you're all done
you
okay guys so there's the finished look I
hope you enjoyed it did you have fun
yeah I did it was actually a lot of fun
I'm good so yes if you really liked how
I did her hair today she's actually
going to wear it to her family dinner
tonight which I'm sure she's excited and
she's also going to be wearing the
outfit with the jean jacket on and I'm
gonna be wearing mine too so we're going
to be twins tonight twinsies
but yeah so if you enjoyed this video
