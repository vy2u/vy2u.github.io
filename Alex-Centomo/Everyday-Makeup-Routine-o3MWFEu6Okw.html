my face is totally bare all blemishes
and redness and all because I decide to
fill my everyday makeup tutorial for you
I figured I haven't done a makeup
tutorial in a long time I think the last
one I did was on my sister when we did
the even esse Hudgens inspired look if
you're interested as you know link it
down below but I actually haven't filmed
one on myself like explaining what I do
and everything and I think over a year
so it's about time to start filming that
I come in with my minor and this one is
just the Porefessional by benefit I used
to use this Smashbox 1 but I just find
that this one is my new favorite because
it just feels amazing on the skin so I
just applied a little bit on the back of
my hand and then I start rubbing it into
my skin you don't want to completely rub
it in you kind of just want to Pat it on
and smooth it out on top of your skin so
it just like creates an even layer over
if it's the face of your skin you don't
just soak it in because then it just
kind of defeats the purpose so after
that's all Pat in that I'm curling with
my foundation and I figured today would
be a good day to film a everyday makeup
routine because I am breaking out it's
like I think the change of seasons or
something or maybe the tournament I'm
not really sure but I am breaking out
more than usual and I just figured that
it would be a good way to show you how I
cover that up cover them up am I also
self tanned yesterday so my face as you
can see does not match my body at all
wow that is really funny so I'm actually
gonna come in with a darker foundation
just to kind of even out my skin to the
rest of my body so this was the
foundation I was using in the summer
it's the Tarte Amazonian clay 12-hour
full coverage foundation I just really
like this foundation and I come in with
my Sigma flat top kabuki brush and I
just find this one works really well for
this foundation
I just find it gives a really even
coverage I don't use too much as you can
see this looks so funny because it's
exception different color than my face
and then I buff it out and I find it
just gives it a really airbrushed look I
also like to blend it into my hairline
so that it really matches well so I
think that's good then I come in with my
concealer and this is just the NARS
creamy concealer I will link everything
down below for you guys also the links
to where you can buy them if you're
interested in purchasing them online so
I just take this brush this is the Sigma
precision tapered so then I will just
apply this I have a little bit of spots
over here I use a very gentle hand when
doing this because I don't want my like
makeup to be caked up on my face I hate
that look so I like to be more natural
if there's a little bit of redness or
whatever peeking through I honestly
don't mind that just because I find it
looks more natural and that's I just
like that kind of look I do around my
nose because women tend to get pretty
red around their noses so once all that
face makeup is done I come in with my
urban decay D slick setting spray I like
this because it sets your makeup all day
nothing moves you can literally like rub
your face on things and it doesn't come
off so it's awesome I spray just a
little bit all for my face kind of like
a far like this
I just wait around 20 seconds for that
to dry and then I will usually come in
with my face powder I like to set my
makeup with a powder just because it
ensures my dog is literally crying
outside my door Lola no I like this
because it like just ensures that the
color stays on your face and also this
is the Porefessional powder so it's the
same thing as the primer and it just
kind of fills in your pores and leaves
your skin looking airbrush and really
nice and I really like it they push this
into my skin on my like areas that get
very greasy and the makeup tends to slip
off a lot throughout the day so usually
it's under my eyes I don't make sheets
near my nose like right here I just push
it in you see how I'm just doing a
little tapping motions and around my
nose and it's mainly my t-zone areas
after that's all done I'll usually come
in and do my eye makeup I've been really
loving especially for the fall time it's
the color tattoo by Maybelline bad to
the bronze and it's just this really
really pretty bronze color as you can
see it's super shimmery I really like it
for all over the lid I find with this I
don't even need to use a primary and I
use a very small amount and see how it's
like very subtle I just use it for the
Oliver lid and I chop try not to rub too
hard
then I'll usually just come in with a
color and this one is I think it's
called patina by math bronzy not
shimmery more sheer color and I just
take my 217 brush by Mac tap off the
excess and just apply this all over the
lid like I did with the I tattoo color I
work a little bit of it into the crease
and then I also bring it down underneath
my eye just a tiny bit I don't like my
eye makeup to be too intense and because
I do have smaller eyes and smaller
eyelids I need to be able to bring the
color up a little bit so that you can
see cuz if I just had my eyes normal
like you literally wouldn't see in the
eyeshadow so I want to bring it up a
little bit over my crease since I do
have hooded eyes I just take a super
super fluffy brush this one is by Mac
and I come in with a neutral brown shade
like this I don't remember the name of
this but I just any neutral brown shade
you have tap off the excess and then I
usually put this a bit over my crease
and blend it up towards my brow bone and
this actually just adds a bit more
dimension to your face and also because
my eyes are smaller you'll be able to
see the color a bit better then once
that's done I usually like to go into my
eyebrows I don't know why I just like
doing eyebrows necks before I do
eyeliner in my scare or anything and
this is the Anastasia Anastasia whatever
you say brow is so as you can see my
brows are not looking at the greatest
right now I do apologize for that I
haven't gotten them fixed in a while and
I'm trying to let them grow out but I
just really like this pencil because it
like allows you to do little brush
strokes and like the thing is so fine
that it looks like you can make little
hairs and I kind of bring that out a
little bit and I'll come in with this
little brush part and I will brush it
out to make it look more natural and
subtle then I come in with a little a
brow gel this is just the clear mascara
by Maybelline now for my eyeliner
new mascara which you guys always ask me
about I usually like to line my tight
line which is like the water line on
your upper lash line and this is just
the Revlon Colorstay one I really like
it it works pretty well I would
definitely suggest the 24/7 and one from
Urban Decay but I'm out of that so this
is a pretty good dupe for that and I
usually just like well I actually don't
need to lift it up cuz I know pretty
well but I go like this and I usually
like to look away because it doesn't
hurt then for the winged liner which I
don't know if I'll be able to do this on
camera cuz it's so hard I struggle with
it every day and it's different every
day but I just used the oh my gosh this
is completely worn out Wow but it's the
Sigma liquid eyeliner like all day wear
one shake up shake it up a bit before
you use it and I just find it gives the
most precise line it doesn't budge all
day I found it through SC button and
missglamorazzi here we go attempting to
do my eyeliner on camera oh bad I start
off all owing the shape of my lower I
kind of go up
that's usually how I start and then I
just go in with the top trying to stay
in frame trying to do liquid eyeliner
cuz I even in frame like I have no idea
but basically and this is what I do I
start from the outer end and I go
towards the middle I know some people do
this do this all different ways but this
is the way I like to do it and then I
kind of just fill in the small little
gaps so I'm gonna go to a mirror to do
this and I'll be back I think that's
honestly the best I could do with on
camera hopefully this is good for you
guys hopefully my eyeliner is on point
please then for my lashes I come in with
my lights camera splashes waterproof
mascara from Tarte I usually just do one
coat to start off I already got some of
my eyelid go Alex but that's okay
because no one's perfect and every time
you get my scar there you can just wait
for it to dry and take it off a little
cotton swab see it's super nice to
mascara but of course to get a little
bit on your eyelid now that the eyes and
everything are done time to work on the
rest of the face this is gonna be such a
long tutorial Wow all for my everyday
look which literally this whole this
whole process takes me around 10 minutes
max on a good day 5 minutes bronzer
hoola by benefit so good this brush is a
big fluffy brush from Mac which I don't
know what it's called
swirl out a little bit in here tap off
the excess
I put a little bit in my cheekbone right
there and then I like to do the three so
I come in on my temple connect it to the
cheekbone and then down the jawline and
underneath my chin this just adds some
dimension to your face some nice
contouring and I really like the way it
looks once that's done I come in with
some blush by NARS this is the NARS
luster which is a very shimmery Coralie
peach color oh there you go there you
can see it and I just find this looks
super nice on bronzy skin so I tap a
little bit onto my Sigma contour brush
tap off the excess smile I work my way
up my temples and on my cheeks
I just find it looks super cute I'm
going in with lip liner everyone asks me
what lip liner I use and I just it's the
same one every single time I just put
different lipsticks on top of it this is
the aqua lip by Makeup Forever and color
15c I start off with the little whatever
this is called
and once that's done I come in with a
lipstick and today I'm going to be using
the makeup for every lipstick this color
super complimenting on top of that lip
color cuz it's like a reddish brownish
pink color there you go if you want a
