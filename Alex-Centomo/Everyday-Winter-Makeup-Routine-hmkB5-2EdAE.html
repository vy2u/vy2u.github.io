what's up guys welcome back to my
channel I recently put out my winter
morning routine video like get ready
with me and I asked you guys if you want
to see this look because this is the
makeup I did and I didn't really go into
detail or what the products are using
stuff so I asked if you guys were
interested in seeing what I use
specifically and all that stuff to let
me know and like majority do I said yes
so I'm super excited about that because
I do still have all of the clips i used
in more detail in length and stuff so i
can really get into how i did this
makeup tutorial all drugstore again love
it i'm really going through a phase
where I'm trying out like really
affordable makeup and just seeing how it
reacts with my skin because you guys
don't know I do still suffer from acne
and stuff so this is the look I did love
the lips seriously this like is just
makes your teeth look so white right few
curious to see how I did this super
simple super easy makeup look it looks
so natural other than the lips like but
like all this is just so natural and
makes everything pop so much just keep
on watching oh my gosh guys so sorry
about that uneven lipstick like yikes
needa lip liner but I'm starting off
with my foundation i actually used two
shades because of in between colors
right now and this just matches my body
perfectly i use a light shade in a dark
shade and kind of just combine them and
then I evenly distribute that all over
my face I start from the center and I
work my way up and out I make sure to
blend down my neck into my hairline and
also my ears because for some reason
they're just always so so so pale and
the rest of my body is usually a lot
more 10 so I need to make sure that all
matches then I'm loving the stick
concealer it's so awesome it's by
L'Oreal Paris as well as the foundation
and this stuff is amazing for contouring
and brightening up any area of your face
and it just blends really well with your
fingers so you don't need a brush for
this your finger works perfectly just
make sure it's clean so you're not
transferring any bacteria and you want
to make sure to do the triangle under
your eyes to give it that really nice
highlighted look onto my eyebrows what
you guys know is always the daily
struggle but I am working on growing
them out
and I'm actually trying really hard to
fill them in properly this product works
perfectly for me because you can draw on
really light brush strokes to make them
look like real hairs because I do have a
lot of missing hair and then I actually
use this brush to make them look more
volume eyes and keep them together and
it looks a lot better on to the eyes I
love this quad by the way everything i'm
using is from the drugstore l'oreal
paris is amazing it's one of my favorite
brands i'll leave all the links listed
down below for you guys if you're
curious to know the exact products I'm
using I use a lighter color on my lid
and then I take the darker color of the
palette not the dark like black one but
the dark brown and I bring it into my
crease as well as onto my brow bone and
this actually deepens up the crease a
lot I don't know where I learnt this but
i think it was somebody doing like a
johnny depp makeup tutorial or making
them look like Johnny Depp and making
their eyes look more Hollow so I like to
do that since I don't have a lot of lid
space then I go in with this liquid
eyeliner I do a very very thin line i've
been really liking that for this time of
year i'm with a very small wing it just
adds something a little bit more subtle
and then going in with my favorite
mascara at the moment seriously love
this stuff the primer makes your
eyelashes super long and then the black
part actually adds a lot of volume as
well as the length and it just makes
your lashes look so long there's so much
volume to them and I really like the way
this makes my lashes look it's not hard
to take off at the end of the night and
it actually stays on all day doesn't
smudge usually my mascara always smudges
and then on to this blush that I'm
actually using as bronzer because I
really like the way that it makes my
cheekbones look I do have quite high
cheekbones and big cheeks so I like to
enhance that feature of mine because I
think it's very flattering and I really
like it
then I just blend it out to make it look
like less harsh because that sometimes
it happens then going in with the lips I
do recommend using a lip liner before
this I usually do but I honestly could
not find my dark when I did one using
nude because there would be literally no
point so I figured I would try it out
but as you could tell from the intro you
definitely need a lip liner but this
stuff is great because it is a liquid
lipstick but it's not drying it does
leave a matte finish but it just looks
so pretty it doesn't like make my lips
feel disgusting I can eat I can drink
and it stays on all day it's so nice it
actually doesn't look that bad here I
feel like I really mess them up when i
was talking or something i don't even
know but i love the way this look is
it's so beautiful and chic so i hope you
