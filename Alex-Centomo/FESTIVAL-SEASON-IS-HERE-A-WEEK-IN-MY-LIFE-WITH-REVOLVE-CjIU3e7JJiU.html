is like super greasy and full of makeup
and I hate being in the Sun with makeup
but at the same time I'm not gonna like
take it all off and just put it back on
later didn't feel much at the brunch
just because when you're like first
getting to know people it's kind of
awkward to throw a camera in their face
especially like even though we're all
influencers just weird it's not everyone
does YouTube and it's just like I felt
uncomfortable so I wasn't gonna make
someone else feel uncomfortable but
seeing the acts
we're heading to Palm Springs today and
I could not be more excited oh it is so
windy here it's crazy the weather is
beautiful it's hot but it's windy AF and
