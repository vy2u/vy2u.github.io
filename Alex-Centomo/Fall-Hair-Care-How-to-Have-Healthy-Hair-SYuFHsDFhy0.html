months equals Alex having super pale
skin whoa
but whatever mime bracing uh guys I'm
embracing the paleness that is me but
today we're gonna be talking about hair
because all of you guys love hair videos
and hair pictures and so do eyes so that
is why I'm doing this video for you guys
because I decided I want you video about
hair okay so things I wanted to talk
about today we're hair but not only hair
just hair growth keeping your hair
healthy how to tame your hair for
specific types of hair I guess I'll give
a little background on my hair if you
guys haven't been following me for a
long long time
then welcome but basically my hair is I
just currently redyed the ombre but I
dye my hair like once a year I'm not
even kidding you the last time I dyed my
hair was almost exactly a year ago I
just let it grow out almost completely
so the things that I've been making my
hair grow a lot no heat regular trims
and certain products that I use in my
hair have really been helping it grow a
ton but honestly no heat is like the
number one thing ever so if you follow
me on YouTube or any form of social
media you will know that I have had a
struggle with my hair but now I am 100%
completely happy with the way my hair is
turned out the way the length of it how
long it is how healthy it is here I'll
just give you a little oh it's really
long I can't even stand up all the way
I'm not wearing extensions or anything
this is all natural hair I'm wearing a
hat because I thought it looked cute
with the outfit but you guys could just
watch my other videos to see what my
full hair looks like but to get to this
took a long time um and years and years
and years of mistakes and I don't want
to go into too much detail because I
have videos all about that kind of stuff
I will link them all down below if you
guys are curious to check them out but
what I do really want to talk about is
dyeing your hair and products you can
use if you do want to dye your hair so
like I said before I dye my hair once a
year maybe once every eight months or
nine months because I like the ombre
look I would keep it all natural except
for the fact that my hair is actually
quite in the
winter it gets quite mousy I don't know
if you guys know what I mean by that I
don't even know what I mean by that my
mom says that so I just I've always been
blonde my whole life as I got older my
hair got darker but I just love to
continue saying blonde and I love the
ombre trend
I just am obsessed with it so what I do
when I dye my hair is I diet to around
here
and then I let it grow out until I feel
like it's just way too out and I need to
read I it but in the summer time my hair
actually gets very very blonde from the
Sun because I'm outside a lot so I don't
tend to have to dye it but as soon as I
like get out of the Sun and it starts to
be October like it is right now and
hailing outside then I will dye it again
if you know anything about me you know I
don't like routine well I like routine I
just don't like using the same thing
over and over and over and over again I
like to try out new things and stuff and
something that I've been recently loving
lately it's been this shampoo
conditioner that looked like this I've
got this at Target when I was in the
States because unfortunately target has
clothes now in Canada but you can find
these anywhere that sells shampoo I'm
not even joking like everywhere sells
them super affordable they go between
like oh I didn't even say the brand it's
Wren pure organics coconut cream
nourishing shampoo and conditioner
smells amazing if you guys love the
smell of coconut you will absolutely
adore these known to be the most
affordable on the market they're
originals line goes anywhere between
$4.99 and $5.99 I believe and the
cleansing conditioner sells between 999
and 1099 what I really like about them
is that they're family-run and they're
family owned which is so amazing because
you don't really see much about nowadays
you just need big brands so something
that's family-run is something that I
definitely want to try out and test for
myself because you just know it's more
genuine than any other product just
trying to sell for money so it says on
the bottle that they are free from
harmful chemicals like sodium chloride
sulfates dyes harsh salts parabens
gluten gluten I'm gluten intolerant not
that um and REM pure is designed for all
hair types keyword all hair types
because I have used multiple shampoos
and conditioners that were recommended
on YouTube
because people have really liked them
and then I get sucked into buying things
because that's just what I am and then I
try out and it does not do the same
thing for me skin care hair care all the
kind of stuff and then I realized that
oh it's not for that specific hair type
my hair type is very naturally wavy
frizzy fine texture but I have a lot of
hair so it does tend to tangle a lot
like I will brush my hair five seconds
later it will be tangled again I will
never have that silky smooth hair that
my cousin Sophia and Lauren have at my
cousin's stuff and a bunch of my other
cousins I just have perfect hair that is
always silky and smooth and they never
have to do anything that's not me
I have beachy messy crazy tornado hair
another thing I really like is that they
say that they will never sell to a
consumer that they wouldn't use
themselves which is great because I
don't want to use something that you
created just to sell me I want to know
that you liked it and that you use it so
I have tried these products out for a
few maybe a full week and a half now
which for me shows a lot when it comes
to my hair my hair usually within the
first two washes will like show 100% and
this product makes my hair so soft shiny
healthy feeling I just love it plus the
smell of this stuff is so good like real
coconut oh I don't explain it let me
smell like that fake coconut scent and
smells like when you buy a literally a
coconut and you smell that
not the outside because that just smells
like tree it's also color safe which is
great because I colored my hairs that's
important they're also the most
affordable salon quality bread which is
like I mentioned before but they are
salon quality so they are like the
cheapest on the market right now and
they say that they never skimp on
quality which is great so yes I'm
literally reading the back of the bottle
for you guys but I just I'm bad at
explaining things but it's just amazing
this stuff is so great so I don't know I
really like to switch up my routine
maybe that's why my hair has been
getting so healthy I'm not too sure to
be honest I feel like a lot of people
try to do exactly what somebody else
does hoping that they their hair skin
body health whatever will just be like
that person but you also have to
remember that everyone's dip
when might work for me might not work
for you but I do have to say that this
product good all-around like my sister
uses it to cuz I just leave it in the
shower so Kylie I know you take my stuff
but I don't care because it's all good
I mean you guys know my sister's hair
it's just beautiful and amazing so oh
shout out to my sister if you guys
haven't subscribed to her channel like
we haven't made a video together in so
long we should do a video together Wow
my brain is all over the place right now
but yes so like I was saying before try
not to use heat as little as you can I
know a lot of you guys you find it hard
not to you there's so many hairstyles
you can do that don't involve heat super
cube braids and just so many different
things and there's so many tutorials on
YouTube tutorials and Pinterest even
people like on Instagram that you can
follow that makes such good tutorials if
you do dye your hair and you need to
have that same color
I would suggest try not using bleach or
going to a professional and seeing if
they could do something more organic
than just buying it out of a box cuz
that's not good for you
and then also regular trims this is not
a myth guys like if you don't trim your
hair your split ends will just
eventually split all the way up to your
roots and just completely fall out like
that's why my hair wasn't growing there
was a point in time where I mean I don't
get regular trims like every four weeks
like some people do or whatever I
probably do it every three to four
months
um but you got to get rid of those split
ends you really got to do it you got to
make sure because for a while I wasn't
doing it and my hair just stayed the
same length because it was just
splitting and I was losing so much hair
like my hair when I put it in a ponytail
or braids now is so much thicker than it
was for three years ago even when I
first started working at brandy melville
my hair was literally here and so thin
and so dead and I remember meeting
Katherine or cat bell for you guys and
just looking at her hair and being like
oh my god my hair could never look like
that and now my hair is literally what
her hair looked like at the time so it's
crazy to think that my hair actually got
to that point but I just started taking
really good care of it and just learning
how to do a bunch of braids so that I
don't have to use heat and just
embracing my natural hair and honestly I
used to be embarrassed about this but I
freaking love my hair right now it's
awesome it just
necie all the time and I just love it
that's my vent session anyways back to
this stuff I just want to talk about
this because I genuinely genuinely like
this stuff and let me just say something
little little side note here I will
never ever promote something to you guys
that I don't genuinely like ever there
has been so many companies that have
approached me offering me so much money
to talk about something and I try it out
and I'm just like no or I just don't
even like the product and I'm like no
I'm not doing it and there's no money in
the world that can pay me to promote
something to you guys because what like
how would that be fair like I promote
something to you and then you try and go
it up this thing sucks why would she
promote that and then like you would
lose trust in me and I'm just be like
one of those fake posers like why would
I want that I want to be your friend I
literally feel like we are friends
genuinely I read every single comment I
get I might not be able to reply to all
of them and to all my emails but I
respond as much as I can and I love you
guys and I want you guys to trust me
because I personally don't like when
youtubers promote something that they
don't genuinely like because then I lose
trust in them so I want to build this
trust with you guys just a side note on
that note if you want to check out these
products the link will be down below but
for real guys like I hope you guys know
that about me I don't want to be a
sellout I don't want that I did not
start my channel to be that kind of
person I also did not start this video
for this to be this type of video but if
you like these more honest two videos
maybe I'll start doing them more often
anyways I think that's about it for
today if you like this video is kind of
rambling stuff but I get so many
questions about my hair so I kind of
want to update you guys with my hair I
want it get it as long as Kyla's right
now so that's my goal
if you want to see more talking videos
make sure to give this video a big
thumbs up or if you want to see a fall
nighttime routine because I get a lot of
questions about that - I think guys all
so much and I will see you all in my
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
