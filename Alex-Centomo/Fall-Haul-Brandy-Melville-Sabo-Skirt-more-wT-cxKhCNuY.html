video I had some extra time so I figured
I would film a fall haul for you guys
because this is so requested I because
I'm traveling a lot I definitely have
been kind of experimenting with more
styles because I've I'm going on like
different places so I'm actually off to
London this week which I'm so excited
before I get started I just want to say
this is not gonna be a try on haul
because I'm planning on filming a
lookbook with a bunch of these items
plus I show pictures of me wearing the
clothing on my Instagram because if you
guys don't know I have a travel slash
fashion Instagram page so I always show
off my outfits if you guys are curious
to see what they look like just stay
tuned for that video which will be
coming very soon or you can just check
out my Instagram and down below so if
you guys don't like hauls that aren't
Tryon then you don't have to watch this
video I'm just I'm just letting you know
beforehand so you're not disappointed um
I guess I'll start off with this watch
because I'm wearing it right now I've
been a huge fan of these watches I see
them all over Instagram you know those
are girls I'm like super trendy and they
like take a picture of their outfit like
and the floor and then they have to
watch like right there and it's like
from above I love those pictures so much
and I always see those watches and I
just really like the sleek look of it
it's kind of like a man's watch like I
call this my grandfather watch because
my grandfather is literally used to wear
watches like this this is by v watches I
found them because of Instagram so I
found everything that's Instagram
because I have a problem with stalking
people and then like finding like new
brands so it's just a simple watch I
will take it off so you guys can see it
a little bit better so it's classic um
silver around there's no numbers it just
lines if you guys if you can't tell time
then shame on you you should all be able
to tell time and it's just the black
leather like straps it's very very soft
on the inside so it came in actually
this really cute box it was packaged
inside of it
and it came with an extra like strap
that's like a like a grayish color so
you can actually exchange the straps if
you wanted to you could switch them up
but I really like black so I think I'm
gonna keep black for a while but I'm
definitely been bringing this with me to
London because I feel like it would look
so good with all my outfits and
have everything planned out so well but
this box guys it's just one of those
boxes that sick it's very nice and it's
just satisfying cos listen listen listen
ready so it's really cool about this
brand and this website is that they're
only available on the 5th of each month
they come out around 12:00 p.m.
Australian Eastern Time and then they're
only available for five days so and like
while supplies last so if they sell out
then they sell out so they're available
to VIP members and also to members that
are like individuals that are on the
wait list and stuff usually most of the
Styles sell out within like the first or
the first two days like first day or
second day so if I were you I would sign
up as a VIP member just so that you can
have like first pick on everything and
also when you are a VIP member you're
just like the first to know about like
giveaways and like exclusive content
like even like competitions and stuff
that they have and another thing I love
about this is that it's free shipping
worldwide because oh my gosh shipping is
so expensive especially when you live in
Canada and you're ordering stuff from
Australia like oh my gosh that stuff is
insanely expensive so I really like that
it's free because that makes everything
a lot easier if you guys are interested
I'll have links down below for you guys
to check out but definitely love this
watch so the first place that I shopped
from Australia SAPO skirt this is why I
know about the shipping guys because
this shipping is just let me tell you
when you live in Montreal but the
clothing from Zappo's skirt is so cute I
can't I can't not so I'm gonna show you
two of my favorite things the first
being this beanie like it's huge but
it's one of those ones that like really
hangs a watch in the back of your head
like this like a crazy amount but I
think it's so cute with like a really
big braid on the side I think would look
so awesome so I'm so excited to start
wearing this especially in the winter
time I think it's gonna look so freaking
adorable my mom like made fun of me as
soon as I took it off the box she's sick
Alex that thing is huge
I'm like that's what she said I've been
watching a lot of the office so the next
thing I bought from SAPO skirt it's
still in the hangar because I was just
hanging up in my closet this corrupt
knit sweater that's a turtleneck you
guys don't know my session with sweaters
get to know it because it's real but
it's just a basic turtleneck knit black
sweater but it's cropped um loving the
cropped sweaters really really cute I
wear this in Peru with some black shorts
and booties and everyone like seem to
love that outfit so I love this sweater
and I think it's so versatile for the
fall and winter so excited for that
heard of like a really dark plum lip um
speaking of crop sweaters this is one I
just showed in my monthly favorites but
I bought it so I'm gonna let you guys
know is this corrupt sweater from brandy
melville Lovett says New York on it
talked about it a ton in my monthly
favorites so if you guys want to check
that out I will come it listed down
below as well as this how I spoke a lot
about this hat but I just bought this
hat and I've been wearing it so much
even though it's kind of more summery
because it's like a baseball cap but
it's also like a fall color so I could
totally get away wearing it this time of
year um probably not the winter but
definitely in the fall um next two
things I got from brandy the first one
is this super oversized super soft white
t-shirt can't have enough of these it's
just kind of like big on the shoulders
it's got a pocket somewhere if you guys
can see that yes I wear this on the
plane I actually even wear this and like
every plane ride I have because it's so
soft and comfortable and it just feels
like you're wearing a cloud and then
you're in the clouds and you're like wow
I'm really weird okay next thing from
brandy which isn't very fall-like but
for me it definitely is so it is this
tank top from brandy like I said and
it's like kind of open in the front and
it has these strings that you could tie
together I think this trend is like
super big right now but it's basically a
cropped tank but I love this for
layering because it just adds something
a little bit more underneath your
clothing because of the detail of the
strings so I would wear this like a
really really oversized thick cardigan
some really nice jeans like ripped up
jeans and booties I think that's such a
cute Oh with the beanie yes okay I have
an outfit in my head and I can't wait to
show you guys on Instagram or in my
lookbook so I'm signing on doing a fall
lookbook so I'm taking shots from like
kind of everywhere that I'm traveling
that's very like fall wise so London is
one of the places and I'm going
somewhere else after London that's very
like fall so I'm really excited about
that
um then I went to free people in New
York City and oh it's so kind of wait I
just did a bunch of laundry so I was
hanging this to dry and it's still a
little damp but is this top from Free
People
it's hmm oh it's so long it's almost
like a dress but it goes super low in
the front because of the buttons and
it's just a short sleeve it's like a
light gray and maroon color I love
maroon and I love gray so pairing those
together is like the perfect thing ever
and the next thing I got from Free
People which is like my new favorite
thing ever is this oversized coat it's
like an old man's coat literally
everything I own is old man's clothing
but I find that looks so cute on a girl
I don't know just like very much my
style so
oh the tide is still on it cuz I
actually have not worn it yet so yes
this was very expensive guys I'm kind of
embarrassed to talk about it 168 dollars
I have these really nice buttons if you
guys can see on the side it's not too
too long it kind of just covers my butt
but it's simple and it has a collar like
this and I'm so excited to wear this in
London so this next thing from brandy is
freakin awesome because it's amazing
quality it's just like this bomber
jacket so it looks it's army green and
it's just a bomber jacket there's a
zipper but I wouldn't spit up I would
keep it open and I think it's so
cool-looking the next three things I got
were from revolve clothing because you
guys know I'm obsessed with that so the
first thing is this long-sleeved crop
knit from four lemon lemons the brand
and it's brethern it's where I'm so
excited towards us with highways
watching then the next thing I got is
from revolve again inside the bread
rails and it's just this plaid like
t-shirt I actually got this because cat
Belle Catherine who's actually coming to
London with me I think she has this one
but in a different color and they sell
them on Free People
basically I would either wear this
buttoned up kind of like this very look
open in the front and tucked into jeans
or I'd wear it open with this tank
underneath that I showed you from before
from brandy so like lots of layering and
then with a leather jacket on top of
that and having a bit of the flannel
looking shirt showing it's not thick
like a flannel but it's not super thin
it's a thicker material definitely and I
got it in a size medium so that it would
be a little bit bigger on me because I
like that look and then the last thing I
got from revolve is by the brand Matisse
Footwear and it's these booties oh so
nice so um they're suede and I don't
know how to explain them but they're by
Matisse and the heel is very chunky but
it's not too high so I feel like this is
gonna be really easy to walk around in
in London I want it to be fashionable
but I didn't want my feet to kill
because that happened in New York City I
look great but my feet were hurt and
like crazy planning on wearing these
heels with the flannel that I showed you
and some pants not sure if I'm gonna go
for like a dark gray color with rips in
the knees I feel like those from Topshop
I don't know if you guys know what I'm
talking about those jeans I used to wear
all the time last fall I think I'm gonna
wear those again with this I think it's
look great so that is it for my haul

single item down below if I can't find
the specific item I will leave something
