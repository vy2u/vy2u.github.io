decided to film a haul video today
because well it's kind of more of a
collective haul I've been shopping a lot
the past couple of weeks so I figured I
would sit down and show you a couple of
things that I got cuz i know you guys
always like to see that kind of stuff um
I did go clothes shopping online um more
in August but the past couple weeks in
September I have been shopping
throughout my mall and getting some new
beauty products and a whole lot my phone
is vibrating oh hello Oh anyway sorry
about that but yeah I've been getting
some beauty products and stuff and I
figured i would show you guys some of
the things i have tested and tried i can
let you know how about worked for me
some things i just purchased today so i
don't really know but uh yeah let's get
started okay so the first thing that i
picked up today is this shampoo by
living proof it's called their full
shampoo I've been hearing a lot of
things positive things about this brand
especially this line through YouTube it
says here that its body boosting gently
cleansing non stripping its color safe
in sulfate-free sulfate free is really
important when you're shopping for
shampoos because it doesn't damage your
hair a lot of shampoo so you get at the
drugstore they do have sulfate and it
can like ruin your hair damage costs
split ends and strip it and everything
like that um my hair is very fine and
brittle so I decided to go for a shampoo
that I knew would definitely help in
that area because I don't want to turn
out bald the next thing I purchased was
this brush cleanser from Mac I've been
hearing a lot of good things about it
normally as you can see in one of my
previous videos I just use like either
baby shampoo or olive oil extra virgin
olive oil and some sensitive dishwasher
dish soap whatever but this stuff is
supposed to be safe for your brushes and
I'm also going to be using as a spot
cleaner so you know if I'm using one of
my brushes and I want to switch colors
but I don't want to use the previous
color that's already been put on the
brush I'll just kind of
put a little bit of this on a paper
towel rub it in to clean and it should
be fine so yeah I'm excited to use this
I also pick this up today the next thing
I purchased actually been wanting this
for a long time I just kind of want to
save up my money before I you know
splurged because it's kind of expensive
but it's this Estee Lauder Double Wear
foundation I've been hearing so many
good things about this there's a huge
hype over the beauty community Beauty
community on YouTube and and it's you
know it's I'd say it's about medium
coverage I'm wearing it today it's
supposed to make your skin really
flawless and youthful and glowy so I
went to the estee lauder counter and I
got it matched for my skin color and it
says here at stay in place makeup and
yeah i would say it stays in place um i
guess a drugstore do for this would be
the revlon colorstay foundation except
this is like double the price and but
it's also way better the quality is way
better better it applies really smooth
which I like it's medium coverage so if
you do want that full coverage I would
suggest to you know build on it apply
maybe two layers but um I do like it
because it's more natural-looking
doesn't really have a scent which I do
like about foundations I don't like when
they have a scent and yeah I really
really really like it it's more of if I
was going to work or going out I would
wear this foundation not so much every
day because it's a bit much and I don't
like to wear makeup everyday but yeah if
you're interested in buying a really
good foundation I would definitely
suggest this one so while I was
searching for foundation I did walk by
the Chanel counter and of course my eyes
were just like Oh drown drawn to it
because I'm just obsessed with Chanel
and brands and all their makeup this
mascara is Cara Delevingne favorite
mascara and it's the sublime waterproof
mascara by Chanel I love it um the wand
is really nice it's pretty thick and
what I like about them this mascara is
that it's lengthening and a bit
volumizing but it doesn't clump and it
really makes
your eyelashes like spread apart which
that's like definitely what I look for
in mascara and waterproof because my
eyes are small so things do smudge a lot
when I wear non waterproof mascara and
it's a very ugly I'd look like a raccoon
I've been building kind of a small mac
eyeshadow collection I have purchased a
lot of my eyeshadows in the past but I
had bought this quad not too long ago
and I only had two eyeshadows in it at
the time and I recently bought two more
eyeshadow colors so the first one is
wedge by Mac of course and it's a really
nice kind of medium brown color it's
matt so there's no shimmer or anything
like that in it I like to use it all
over the lid or just more of a crease
color for more definition and contouring
so that's why I got that and then today
I picked up quarry by Mac I don't know
it's more of a topi gray color and I
really really like that so I was
thinking of using this on more of the
outer corner of my eye and I be playing
around with these colors to make some
really nice fall tutorials for you guys
so that should be exciting I also decide
to go to support today and pick up the
eyeshadow by stila called kitten I've
been ones for a very long time and I
think this all over the lid with um the
topi color from Mac that his purchase
would be really really really nice
together and I'm excited to create a
tutorial for you guys so yeah your eyes
peeled for that the next thing I
purchased today from Sephora as I was in
the line to go to the cash register and
they have all this like samples and
stuff i always get sucked into those um
but i did actually need this so it's
good that i bought it but it's this the
beauty blender cleanser so the little
sponge that i have called the Beauty
Blender it's the pink one that I use to
apply my foundation and concealer with
um I needed a proper cleanser for that
so basically this thing had just comes a
little soapy thing in it and what you do
is you completely soaked your
Beautyblender after you use it or like
once a week is what i would suggest how
often to clean it and you completely
soaked it and then you rub it around in
the soap you don't want to like cleanse
it in the soap you just want to rub it
around so that the soap stuff does get
onto the Beauty Blender and then
use your hands hopefully they'll be
clean we use your hands to rub it
through the Beauty Blender and really
deep clean and get all the makeup out of
it and so that way the next time you use
it you won't be reapplying old makeup
and also bacteria that gets built up
onto the Beauty Blender and then it can
cause you to break out and it's just not
good for your skin so yeah I'm excited
to use this I really like it so far I've
only used it once but it definitely I
could tell that made a huge difference
the next to beauty products that i
bought i actually bought a couple weeks
ago and i am totally in love with them
the first one is this highlighting color
by Mac it's a cream highlight um I
really really really like it it's pretty
subtle it's not too shimmery so it
doesn't look too extreme I like to wear
it during the day and this one is called
pearl and so yeah I really really like
this one it's more natural and dewy and
glowy and youthful looking so that's
good and then I got a cream blush it's
the first cream blush I ever owned in my
life I normally just get powder blushes
but I decided to go for a cream one and
this one is lady blush by Mac um it's
really nice rose color very natural it
looks very natural on your cheeks kind
of like when you are blushing for real
so yeah I really really really like it I
kind of have some dents in it because I
didn't know how to use it at first so I
was like digging my fingers in there and
stuff which is not your supposed to do
I'm actually bought a brush specifically
for cream blushes no I know what to do
the last beauty products that i have
actually got as in sephora you could
accumulate points and if you have
certain amount of points you can get
free products and i normally never use
my points i just kind of keep building
them and i saw that they had this as an
option i definitely wanted to try the
samples because i wanted to buy the big
bottles and it was this kit of cuddly
stuff i think that's how you pronounce
it cuddly some france and it's a really
really really nice luxurious brand and i
especially want to try these two things
and i know after trying them for a
couple weeks now that I definitely be
repurchasing the
your bottles the first thing is this
serum and this stuff you're supposed to
put all over your face in places where
you do have like acne discoloration
scarring and redness morning a night you
put it all over your face and your neck
I usually put it before my moisturizer
and it's just supposed to help with like
redness and it tightens your skin and I
actually really found a huge difference
when I started using this stuff it
smells really good as well as very fresh
and yeah definitely be repurchasing a
larger bottle of this the next thing is
the Connelly Oh what is this honestly
don't know how to pronounce this but
basically is a moisturizer you can use
it morning and night but i like to use
it more in the morning because it does
have SPF of 15 so i figure that it's
better to use that during the day when
the Sun does hit my face I really like
it it's not a white color actually comes
out more like a tan color which is
really cool in it you can actually use
this as a primer as well which I
actually didn't know but reading the
back it does say that it's not too wet
if you know what I mean it kind of if
you put it on your face and it dries
pretty quickly but it doesn't leave your
skin drawing it's very moisturizing I
really like it and the third thing that
came with was this um toner kind of
thing it's more of like it's kind of
like my bioderma but I've been hearing a
lot of great things about it I do have
the bigger bottle already because I was
so in love with it what I do with this
is after i remove my makeup with my
makeup wipes i use two little cotton
swabs a little bit of this and what it
does is it just gently removes all the
excess makeup that you didn't get off
with the wipes and it also cleans your
skin so all your pores it clears out
everything I like to use before I go to
bed and when I wake up in the morning
before I wash my face just to get off
all the excess stuff if you're
interested in a really nice toner I
definitely recommend this I also did
some online shopping I got a quite a lot
of things but I'm willing to show you a
couple because I don't want this video
to be like 20 minutes long but i'll show
you like couple products from each place
that i shopped so the first thing i did
was i shopped on Toby calm and I got
this really cool Jean
packet that kind of looks like a blazer
if you know what I mean like the little
collar here and stuff it's really cool
it's oversized it's baggy it's um kind
of an acid wash thing going on so no I
really like it it's different I also got
this hat from urban outfitters the other
day which I thought was really cool
starting to get back into the beanies
because fall is starting and i'm so
excited i love fall to my favorite
season and yeah anyways i got these two
things also from Jack Bennett com she's
a designer that I discovered through
Instagram actually and she sells some of
her things that urban outfitters but a
lot of the things that I know she has
aren't sold there so I just like to
order online but it's this top here um
like this all these hearts and it says
like loser in real life eat Derek
catfish pizza get lost creep you're
gross no but I just thought it was
really funny obviously I don't think
that stuff about love but I know I
thought it was a really cool shirt so I
got that and the next thing i got was
another thing from Jack clinic and it's
this unicorn um like muscle tee and on
the bottom it says wasted I don't drink
so this doesn't really apply to me but i
do have unicorns i really like the
colors i thought it was really cool so
yeah i'm a sucker for a really cool
graphic muscle tees or just graphic tees
in general i thought it was really neat
so i picked that up and then the next
thing I got from Toby calm was this army
jacket I posted a picture of this if you
follow me on instagram you'll know but i
posted a picture of this on Instagram
and a lot of people were asking me where
i got it so i got it from toby com if
you guys don't know what that website is
i'll link it below your first purchase
you get fifty percent off your whole
shopping bag which is really cool they
have a bunch of things that are very
similar to the stuff you'd find on nasty
al com so yeah I really like it it's um
it's big kind of oversized I think it
would be perfect for fall and I'm really
excited to start wearing this more often
it's really fun I think this would be
really cool with like you know basic tee
underneath and some leggings or some
dark jeans and combat boots and like a
big scarf I think would be
and the beanie would look really good
with that too so yeah that's about it
for my whole um pretty quick not that
many things but I want to you know sit
down a filmer video I've been really
busy lately and I didn't want to you
know stop making videos a lot of people
keep asking me to start putting them up
more often I'll try my best there are a
couple of tutorials and I want to do
which should be coming up in the next
few weeks definitely going to put some
time aside to sit down and film those
things don't forget to thumbs up this
video if you liked it and let me know in
