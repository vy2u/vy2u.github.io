did announce this and I wasn't planning
on doing doing doing this video on a
Monday but Karina and I really want to
film a halt because we had a lot of
stuff that we want to show you guys so
he figured what perfect way to do it
then do together yeah and you guys like
it's doing videos together I know in our
last video a lot of you guys said you
wanted us to do a haul and stuff so if
you're interested in doing and I was
doing more videos together then let me
know in the comments below so this stuff
is kind of like in a corporation of I
guess fall fall and I don't know nice
stuff we'd wear to school or no for like
everything dad second big collective
haul like dude that's what i was
thinking over to left collective haul
from like throughout time yeah we're
going to film part 1 on my channel and
then part two on hers so if you want to
see everything that we got then you'll
just have to go check her out after all
like we believe in everything go on her
face and down below so let's get started
I show these in my August favorites but
I did just recently get these so I want
to show you guys are these genes from
one teaspoon they're just the really sad
crotch ones would like the big open me
and like tight ankles and I'm just
obsessed with them I've shown pictures
of this before and stuff I would wear
this in the fall would like some really
cute like Doc Martens I think cuz I'm
like kind of grunt you like that that's
like a top and a flannel and yeah I've
shown that before someone may get into
detail because you guys to see that
alright so my first item is just this
long sleeve top from brandy melville
know you see it all there and it's just
really saw this stretchy material and
really cute for the fall you have like a
lot of t-shirts and stuff but always
like a nice long
kind of still t-shirt material and I'd
probably just wear days who wear this
with a cute skirt with like high socks
or even just um high-waisted pants early
any kind of its not to crop it's kind of
a little longer seeking wear this with
boyfriend jeans would be super kiya like
really like your converse or running
shoes or even booties that's what the
best of a basic stuff is yeah you were
pretty much anything yeah I really I
don't have to tell you what you can wear
a t-shirt yeah you miss that I disrupted
okay next thing I got is this like black
t-shirt dress tunic thing from Windsor
um I just see these everywhere and I
thought this one would be so cool
because for one is black and like black
is everything when it comes to fashion
yeah I had followed by but yeah I just
really like this it's like it's like an
oversized t-shirt so I would probably
wear like little shorts under this just
in case they bent over or whatever but I
think with like five high socks would be
so cute and some like really cute
booties I don't know I think this is so
awesome and like even a flannel tied
around the waist is so cute and then
there also is like a little hole cut out
thing in the back which is super nice
and it just gives it a little detail and
oh yeah the back is a bit longer than
the front and yeah it's just simple but
I like it my next item ard or ear maybe
I smell like a Tom proper grammar our
meat pen there from efficient fashion
and it's an online store um and just so
cute I even wear them like kind of fancy
cuz they have like the little cuffed uh
bottom leg there
then the are they swipe at sight oh but
that's it they're like really comfy in
there almost sweatpants material so I
mean if I have to look kind of more
proper to go to school or something I
could wear these for the same time still
be super comfortable and you're just
sitting on that chair all day you know I
know so I'm just really excited to wear
these definitely gonna wear them to
school which I really shot in OC I don't
look sticking it are trying hard really
yeah when really you just sweat peds
speed a bum okay so the next thing I
have is kind of summary but it's just my
new favorite top from daily look and
it's just like this crop top with like
little pom-pom detailing and I saw
something similar to this on 3-11 lemons
and I just really fell in love and I
would honestly wear this in the full
time with my high waisted jeans from
Topshop you know like the dark gray ones
with the peanuts on the knees and some
really cute booties I think it'd be so
cute and then if I does get cold then
throw in like a flannel or like a big
like oversized blazer or something I
just would be awesome plus since it's
white and simple like you can get away
wearing it especially with something my
wasted because it's just simple I feel
like I'm saying that for everything okay
so my next piece of clothing is this
cute dress oh I love this hunted dream
wait your sister wore this in the
picture yes she's already boarded before
I even had a chance okay hey where's my
dress from it yeah comes from hunted
dreams and i thought i'd show something
that you can maybe like we're like we're
a little dressier on the weekend out for
dinner or party or whatever whatever you
do do not know what you guys do oh so i
love the detail at the bottom of the
dress i don't know if you can see these
just really stripey but um has kind of
like a little slit here it's not an
actual slit because it's attached but
and it goes over yeah it looks like one
and it goes just a little bit longer
little kit reach a little bit longer on
one side that the top just has a normal
kind of t-shirt sleeve super kid
and I think it's awesome like for the
fall you know black and white again and
you where do I sit down yeah and that's
all I would say you could wear it with
like you know big blood worms like it's
maybe a big black cardigan or something
and some combat boots or some little
booties and you could just even wear
that to school if you really want but
and then you could also dress it up with
some high heels and we're not on the
weekend so this is definitely a must I
like that's like structured yeah yeah
it's like anna has yeah and it's very
form-fitting keep it on the straight
trip boo got this top from Brandi I have
the same one in black oh no why I know
it's so my good this is my talk from
Brandi boys you're both evaluated like
cover the whole screen with it you can't
even see us anymore it's cuz it's super
stretchy but to be honest chaos so use
wide but I like those kinds of shirts
like this is kind of a white shirt as
well but it just long sleeve it's tight
from like here down and then gets looser
like around the limit area I guess you
could say and it's just super baggy and
comfortable super soft and I love
stripes &amp;amp; Stripes for the fall or just
like so awesome this was like a like
super tight black skinny jeans combat
boots and like a leather jacket thrown
over so nice of a big scarf just like Oh
layering fall season guys I'm so excited
I don't know I want to do so many more
holes oh my god same guys you like halls
i know i do haul us a lot but you you
like them or I've got any holes yet oh
it's true well I just so many more I
know I've always liked everything I've
shown so far is great in black and
that's the thing so I decided I was like
really try hard to add something to my
wardrobe that's not say black or white
so this is really baby pink and you know
soft and fuzzy and warm and comfy and
it's just a little crop top and again
has just like a normal sleep
oh I know right so soft i want to live
in this all the time and yeah i would
wear this just with again a hyatt like
high-waisted jeans high-waisted black
pants um and a little like leather
jacket maybe in the fall looks so cute
and it let it bring something girly turn
yeah exactly and again i'm always in the
darker colors so yeah i just kind of
adds a little bubble gum to your outfit
never said bum bum bum bubble bum fun ok
and this is from window lane again an
online store that I joke is it
Australian yeah it is sausage I feel
like these tops are so Australian like I
see them all over Instagram like the
Australian yeah I got it will actually
got it in the summer but I haven't
really worn it yet you get it when
you're in Australia yeah except I kind
of just been waiting to wherein the
fault because when I was in Australia

by the way if you don't know she also
looks very Australian oh he's tell my
bad leg I don't wish used by them but
it's not like the long blonde hair and
like her style is very Australian she's
listing a surfer chick she's like super
chill I just all want to be friends with

knit sweater with a big pocket in the
front see that and there's also like a
ripped detailing this season um oh yeah
like right here yeah it's a grayble it's
just very like grungy looking and super
oversized and I really like this color
for the fall I just find a sec super
cool and I think this was like a big
floppy hat would be so nice and like
some leggings and look a little tiny
