gonna buy sweet discard and you've been
running free outfit number one this is
one of my all-time favorite outfits to
wear during this season I think it's so
casual but still really chic and cute
and also I thought it matched the
pumpkins really well so the cardigan I
have on is from Urban Outfitters I'll
have everything linked down below by the
way guys I really like this color denim
with this color sweater I find it just
ties to looking perfectly and then the
boots are a nice brown color there from
revolve and I thought it looked amazing
with the jeans the jeans are from ASOS
you guys know they're my like go-to
jeans and I'm wearing a really old
t-shirt from brandy this outfit is
another one of my faves because it
includes a grey sweater you guys know my
obsession but also this tan scarf
I thought the look went perfectly
together and in the past I would have
never worn Browns gray I don't know why
or tan with grey cuz it looks so good
together but I just really liked it the
jeans are the same as the first look the
sweater is ASOS and the scarf is from
acne and then I thought adding on this
cream teddy bear coat looked so nice
together I thought this was like perfect
for a colder fall day and it just
matches perfectly I love it so what I'll
do down below is have links to the exact
items as well as ones that are very
similar but an alternative for like a
more affordable price
this third outfit is my fave I have this
jacket from Zara and the sweaters from
Zara as well but I thought this color
looked so perfect for this time of year
guys like seriously how does it look
with the leaves I'm obsessed with it
it's warm and this is the biggest size
and it's kind of tight on me so keep
that in mind my jeans are from lovers
and friends from revolve and these are
super old booties I have I don't even
remember where they're from but I've had
them for years they're like my go-to
booties I love them and my glasses are
from Garrett light
this next outfit is a fave of mine I
actually ended up returning the sweater
because it was kind of itchy and I found
a cuter one at Zara Soho I'll have that
one link down below but this one is
originally from All Saints it looks
really pretty it's just the feeling I
don't know the Hat is old old old from
Urban Outfitters the jeans are from
citizens of humanities they are my
favorite jeans I love them so much and
these sneakers are I think they're
Alexander McQueen but converse sounds
like an identical one and this last
outfit is another one of my faves the
top is from Windsor I love the color you
guys know mustard yellow so nice the
denim jacket is from Topshop and the Hat
is from Windsor as well
jeans are the same ones I had on before
from lovers and friends the boots are
from acne and the belt is from princess
Polly I'm also wearing my lucky hair
extensions just cuz I find it just adds
so much volume and length and makes the
outfit look so good I'm obsessed and
these are just some of my favorite
outfits to wear this time of year the
fall has been really warm right now
honestly guys adjust accordingly
depending on your weather
I just love pumpkins guys you should
follow me on Instagram you'll see all
the pumpkin love and of course I just
wanted to include some drone footage
because right now
the nature is unreal I cannot get over
it I thrive in the fall I think it's
beautiful it's calming it's relaxing I
just love it I hope you guys enjoyed

notifications on and subscribe I love
you guys and I'll see you all in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
