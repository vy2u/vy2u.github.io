of the dark you've never seen it look so
easy I got a river for a soul and baby
you're a boat baby you're my only reason
you keep this
what's up everyone it is officially full
time I'm so so happy right now because
fall weather is my favorite weather in
the entire world I really don't want
winter to come for Christmas it's fine I
don't mind the snow but right now I'm
just living the fall weather and I was
recently in London if you don't follow
me on Instagram or snapchat or my
vlogging channel which you guys should
because I upload so much when I'm
traveling and I'm traveling a ton right
now it's crazy like actually crazy but I
was recently in London because I was
working with Alex and Mimi if you guys
don't know them they are the owners of
luxy hair and I got the opportunity to
work with them which I was so excited
about I took the opportunity when I was
there to be able to film some of my
outfit so I decided to film an outfit of
the week video for you guys fall edition
/ London Edition because of course it's
fall weather in London best weather ever
by the way when we were there we heard
that it was raining like right before we
got there and also rained when we left
so we have like the perfect weather when
we were there sweater weather and it was
just amazing so I decided to fill my
outfits for you guys and I'm not gonna
continue rambling because I ramble so
much in my intro so let's just get into
the video yeah
yes
you have to do this I was thinking that
you could be trusted did you have to
ruin what was shiny now it's all rusted
then you have to
like you're laughing right at me
Oh
because I
when I
know that you always
so I really hope you guys enjoyed this
video if you did make sure to give it a
big thumbs up let's please get it to
10,000 likes that would be so awesome if
we could so if you haven't yet go down
and click the thumbs up button now to
make me super happy also if you can't
tell I do have a cold I don't know if
it's picking up on camera but my voice
is all raspy and like reminds me of
Phoebe and friends when she got sick and
she has a sexy singing voice even though
I don't sound sexy at all also let me
know down in the comments which outfit
you would wear most or which outfit was
your favorite and also if you have any
other video suggestions I am traveling
so much like I said and I think I'm
gonna make a video I'm not sure if I'm
gonna make it on my main channel or on
my vlogging channel but I get a ton of
questions from you guys asking how I
travel so much how I Ford it if people
sponsor me to travel so I think what I'm
gonna do is make just like one video all
about that kind of stuff because I do
actually spend a lot of money on
traveling so I I have like a lot of tips
and tricks I think if you guys are
curious or interested in knowing my
travel story let me know in the comments
down below
love to make that for you guys and of
course I hope you guys are all having a
wonderful day or night wherever you are
in the entire world and I will see you
all in my next video bye everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
