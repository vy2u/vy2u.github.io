searching for assembly
it's been waiting for you welcome Turner
welcome to New York
what's up guys i'm here today with
catherine and we have this really fun
idea to film it kind of like cozy winter
/ fall night in with your girlfriend and
kind of like tumblr inspired so like
just your fall / winter essentials
because I mean it's November so it's
gonna be winter yeah I mean where we're
from it's about to snow so yeah it's
really cold so we just can't put this
really fun idea and I hope you guys
enjoy it and let's get into the video I
love to bake and these gluten free apple
cinnamon donut bites are incredible all
you need is two cups of unfiltered apple
cider half a cup of sugar 1/4 cup of
butter half a cup of buttermilk shaken 2
large eggs 2 teaspoons of pure vanilla
extract 1 and a 3/4 cups of all purpose
gluten-free flour 1/4 cup of almond
flour 1/2 a teaspoon of xanthan gum and
that makes it like really sticky and
stuff 2 teaspoons of baking powder 1
teaspoon of baking soda 1 teaspoon of
ground cinnamon 1/2 a teaspoon of salt
half a teaspoon of ground nutmeg and a
quarter teaspoon of cloves and I just
mix those together the first thing
you're gonna do is boil the apple cider
and when it comes to a boil you're gonna
let it simmer for around 5 to 10 minutes
and then you're gonna set your oven to
400 degrees Fahrenheit spray your pen
with any kind of grease use butter then
you're just gonna want to mix all the
ingredients together so I will have all
of the directions and everything listed
down below in the description so if you
guys want to follow along properly but
basically you start off by mixing the
butter and the sugar you want to blend
that for around 10 minutes I'd say until
it becomes kind of like a chunky
consistency
once that's done you're going to break
two eggs into the mix and then you're
going to blend that together
then you're going to go on in with the
buttermilk and you're going to blend
that and mix it as well as the vanilla
extract
now here's where it gets messy you're
gonna add in all the dry products so
every single thing you have left you're
going to mix that in together until it
becomes a very dough like consistency of
course this is a gluten free recipe
because I am gluten intolerant but if
you guys want to substitute the
gluten-free items for regular items you
can do that as well but honestly these
taste amazing and they're gluten free
which is great so when it becomes a
consistency like this that's when you
know you're done you are then going to
put all of the mixture into your little
pan and I like this because they're like
little donut balls they're just so
amazing and then you're gonna pop that
in the oven for 10 minutes
while that's baking you're gonna want to
work on the topping for the doughnuts so
you're just gonna take your sugar and
your cinnamon and you're gonna whisk
that together until it's completely
blended and this is honestly like the
most simple but best topping for a
doughnut ever in my opinion I love it so
much
once they are done and out of the oven
you're actually gonna just take some
melted butter and brush this on top of
the little donut muffin thingy but if
you don't have a brush like this you can
literally just dip it in the butter and
that's just to make the sugar and
cinnamon stick to the outside and it's
so good guys oh my gosh I've actually
obsessed the cinnamon with the Apple
it's just it's amazing and my favorite
ball treat ever and it's just like a
delicious little thing to have with your
girlfriend while you're like watching
Netflix or doing your nails or whatever
on a fun girls night in
as for my fall essentials I love to have
my hair in this half of fun you guys
know I'm obsessed with it with some
baggy oversized sweaters dark nails and
thigh high socks that is by far my go-to
outfit to relax in and I love it and
it's like very tumblr and of course you
need a little hug from your doggie so I
hope you guys enjoyed the video I don't
know why I said this but I hope you guys
