what's up guys so I'm here today filming
my februari January what month is it
februari favorites Wow honestly 2015 is
just like rushing by like I don't even
know I actually did a lot of traveling
in the past two months I haven't had
like that much time to experiment with
new products and stuff but I have had a
few favorites that i figured i would
show you guys because you love seeing my
favorites videos and i know i love
watching them so i guess i'll start with
beauty first because that's just must
the first thing has to be this Tarte
Amazonian clay the full coverage
airbrush foundation so this is just the
powder foundation that i have like the
liquid one too and I got it with this
little brush thingy and this is like a
really dark shade I got this in the
summer to use for the summer time but
then I stopped using it because I got
pale again but because i was in Barbados
and LA and I had a spray tan it does not
show up at all like I look so pale in
this camera but trust me guys like in
person I'm really 10 this is just really
weird like I don't know what's going on
this powder is the one I use wow this
looks really pale on camera too that's
so strange because in person it's like
super super tan I've been using this
instead of foundation i just found its
way better for my skin I don't need to
apply that much it just looks more like
skin rather than makeup on my face and I
just really like that look the only
issue I have is that like when i am back
home and make sure all my skin tends to
get really dry cuz it's super cold here
and like it clings to your flakiness so
I don't use this when I'm like in the
cold but because i was traveling to
warmer places i brought this with me and
it was perfect the next thing i've been
loving has been this um it's like an
eyeshadow like stick and it's fight Aiko
and it's called me and my shadow
waterproof shadow liner in taupe and on
one side it comes this little brush
thingy that you can like brush out but I
actually don't use that I just use the
other side which is the taupe eyeshadow
side a little sticky thing and I just
honestly apply this all over my lid like
pretty messy
just kind of swipe it all on and then I
use my finger to blend it out and it
looks really natural and really pretty
and perfect for on-the-go so honestly
like when I was traveling i would put
the airbrush foundation on this on my
eyelids do my eyebrows put on mascara
and i was good to go that was it and
then to take off my makeup i've been
using this from aiko as well it's the
mascara off my makeup remover end I
don't know how good this is for your
face but because i was traveling and
this is small i use this on my face and
it like took off everything and like one
swipe it's amazing and I didn't break
out or anything so I'm assuming it's ok
to use in my face but I don't know I
guess it depends on your skin type but
I've been absolutely loving this and
they're super tiny to like they're
perfect for removing your eye makeup and
I was kind of like I was in LA and I was
like oh no I don't have anything to like
take off my full-face makeup I guess
I'll just use this to and I like went
like this and it was all gone and I'm
just like sweet ok then the next thing
I've been loving again is something I
bought for traveling and then just fell
in love with it i went into sephora and
I just asked one of the girls I was like
I need a product that um is small but i
can bring on an airplane because i
wasn't checking any luggage I needed
like a face cream that was under 100 mil
and they gave me this one its board it's
from origins and it's just a zero oil
oil free moisture with saw palmetto saw
palmetto and mint it smells very minty
and fresh and I really like it a lot I
bought it before I went to Barbados and
it is like the perfect cream for me like
this kate somerville one is super good
for when my skin is like really dry and
flaky and it's just a needs hydration
this one is perfect for when I'm kind of
in warmer climates because my tin might
in my skin tends to get quite oily and
then also has the dry patches I don't
know my skin is just weird it's all over
the place but this really helps to kind
of even it all out before I put makeup
and I use this before they did my makeup
for the shoot and it lasted all day now
and my skin was not dry it was not
really it was perfect and I just
I faked this so Thank You origins for
being amazing because this product is
great the next thing I've been loving is
by Amica and it is this product right
here it's the texture spray it says
undone texture spray seed Buckhorn
buckthorn buckthorn bow for insane
volume texture and a matte finish for
all hair types and I just spray it all
in there oh my god this stuff smells so
good I wish you could smell like guys
like I don't know how to explain this
scent like there's no way I got this
online I don't I know they used to sell
this stuff at sephora i don't know if
they still do but if not i'll leave a
link to the website down below we can
check it out the reason why I know about
this company actually is because I think
like five or six years ago I had gone to
sephora looking for moroccan oil and
they're like oh we actually don't sell
that here but we have this thing called
a mica oil and I use that for like three
years like I brought with me to
Australia I brought it so many places
and I just use it as an oil for my ends
and it smelled amazing and it's I think
it's the smell of like all the products
because I even have this which is
another favorite of mine it's like their
hair mask and it comes in the box and
the baggie and I actually use a half the
bag from my full-time and it comes with
a bunch of them so i use this around
once a week or once every two weeks just
to kind of replenish my hair and it
smells it's like the Amica smell I don't
know how to explain it it smells amazing
like florally but like a bit more musky
I don't know I love it I love it so much
and then because I've been traveling I
needed some hand sanitizer so I was with
my cousin Sofia at the mall and I went
into bath and body works because I just
find the regular Purell ones just smells
so strong and it gives me a headache so
I picked up three bath and body works
hand sanitizers but i think my absolute
favorite one is this one which is the
donuts because it literally smells like
donuts and every time I put it on my
hands in California someone's like oh
what's it smell it smells so good I'm
like
and sanitizer so I got the doughnuts one
I got cupcake and hey honey bun all like
dessert smells they all smell really
good but I've been using this one a ton
and i love it on to fashion i've been
wearing these a ton when i was traveling
because obviously i can't wear these
with the snow because it would just be
impossible and the snow would ruin them
but there are these booties from matisse
you guys all know these booties have
shown that many times but i am obsessed
with them like i'm still in love with
them and i get so many compliments on
them every time i wear them why i said
them a lot they're just simple black
booties but can't go wrong they go with
everything I wore them in LA with like a
long sleeves kind of like half turtle
neck striped top with my black 1
teaspoon shorts and then these and I
just felt like I was rocking it and I
love that outfit so much and I love both
games so much and then the next thing
has been this sweater from brandy
melville it's just the cardigan simple
cardigan it's long and thick and I got
this I think like two months ago I
forget a month ago and it's just really
really comfortable it's like a pretty
big knitted material I've shown this in
pictures before on Instagram and stuff
and um I just really like it because
it's soft I wore this a ton this month
just kind of like lounging around and
doing things especially when I edit for
some reason i like to wear like big
oversized sweaters and this was
definitely like almost every single day
i was wearing this and then this is kind
of random actually but this month for
some reason I kind of like dug into my
bralette drawer and was like searching
for new bra let's to wear under like
white t-shirts because I had a 10 okay
this happens every time I like habitat
or something I want to like wear bright
colors or something to kind of like show
off the time because I I'm normally like
ninety percent of my life I'm pale
because I live in a super cold country
but when I have a ten i like to show off
so um I actually brought out this for
love and lemons brought that I got in
the summer which you guys probably will
recognize because i use this a ton in
the summer but I've been actually
layering this on
are like white long sleeve t-shirts that
are not like see-through but like a
little bit see-through so you could see
kind of the blue and because this isn't
actually a bra doesn't look that like
scandalous because it does go down
pretty low so this I just found like
super cute like peeked through the white
and just really accentuated my 10 and I
don't know I've been wearing this a ton
plus it's like the softest thing ever
and like I think I'm gonna bring this to
Coachella because this with like
high-waisted shorts and like a kimono is
so pretty like a big chunky like
necklace going on I just love that look
and then these booties obvi because
although I am scared to wear these
booties because i don't want dirty them
because Coachella's looks super dirty
you have any suggestions for cheaper
versions leave them down below because I
wouldn't mind spending like twenty
dollars and then happened them be ruined
but these are we're like pretty
expensive so I don't want to ruin them
and I think my last favorite of the
month has been Melanie Audrey bracelets
you guys all know I love Melanie Audrey
and I'm actually doing a giveaway with
her for spring break if you haven't seen
that video I will leave it linked in the
comments not the comments the
description down below but basically i'm
giving away a few Melanie Audrey
bracelets and I don't know I just love
them I wear them like every single day
and they're just super comfortable and I
just love the meaning behind them and
look how pretty they are so I hope you
