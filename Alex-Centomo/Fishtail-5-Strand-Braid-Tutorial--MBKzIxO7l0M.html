video for you I asked some questions and
some of my recent Instagram pictures of
what videos you guys would like to see
and I think the most requested one was
the how to do a fishtail and how to do a
5 strand braid tutorial and I know there
are a lot of videos out there on YouTube
but I mean that's what you guys don't
want to see that's what you want to see
just because I've been posting a lot of
pictures with some fish tails and
different kinds of braids so I figured I
would just show you by the way I'm sorry
if I sound sick or I'm a little like not
it's hyper because I just oughta be the
stomach flu and um it was not very fun
so for the fishtail braid I mean this is
pretty simple for me I think it's easier
than a regular braid just because I do
it so often I'm sorry if my head kind of
gets cut off but I really want you guys
to see like the braid so how I usually
do it if I'm doing it on the side isn't
just split it into two start off start
off with a small layer on the outside
bring it across you add it to a small
section from this side bring it across
to this side and you just keep you want
to pull it each time and just keep
adding like that so small section pull
small section pull
it's so simple lies my hair is kind of
still wet because I just showered and
what's different about my braids is that
because I have ombre hair it's like two
different oh wait here's a little layer
piece oh gotta make sure that it stays
it's like two different colors in my
braids which is pretty cool I like that
oh yeah actually I was wondering would
you guys be interested if I started
vlogging I don't know if many people
would want to see that but there's a lot
of exciting stuff coming up in my life
and I thought that I would vlog some
things so if you guys would be
interested in that let me know in the
comments below because I've always loved
watching vlogs I mean I started watching
the Shaytards when I started watching
YouTube and I always wanted to like
daily vlog but I mean who wants to see
like a girl go to school I mean it's not
very interesting but now that I have a
lot of exciting stuff coming up a lot of
trips and a lot of special things that I
can't really talk about right now but I
think would be really interesting to
watch if you guys are interested in that
then just let me know in the comments or
an Instagram if you want to see some
vlogs of that because that would be
pretty cool so I hope you guys can see
what's coming along again there's no
exact measurement for the pieces that
you use you just kind of grab smaller
sections from the outside of each part
and just add it and as you get to the
end it kind of gets hard again because
you're working with like smaller pieces
so two pieces one over to the other side
smaller section then the whole section
bring it to the other side pull small
section bring it to the other side pull
and then you just elastic it like that
and here is a fishtail I like to just
pull it apart like this and that is how
I do a fishtail braid very simple very
easy to do I mean there's no technique
to it other than make sure that each
section that you're taking from you have
two sections you take a small section
from each side you don't want to grab
like half of that section because it's
just gonna look not nice so take a small
section from each side and you just add
it to the other one it's super simple
really cute I mean if you're going to go
all out and make it super messy you can
like really pull on it like this have
some pieces like hanging out but I mean
like that's really messy I like when
it's not that messy okay so moving on to
five strand braid let's get this out of
there okay so a five strand braid is a
bit different than most braids this one
is actually sort of hard to get at first
so it'll probably take a couple tries to
get it but once you do I promise it
looks really cool it kind of just looks
like a really intricate thick braid it's
kind of like weaving a basket actually
you need five second sections to the
braid so I mean they don't all have to
be super even so you grab all your hair
one two three okay so I don't know if
you guys can see I have five pieces
right here pulled out and I like to
number my pieces so the piece that's
closest to my head that's one then two
three four five is the one that's
farthest so the first thing you're going
to do and the way I like to hold the
pieces is I have two in each hand and
one is just kind of
it's just easier for me to do so the
first one how I start is you take the
number one it goes over number two under
number three and then it just you just
drop it and you when you're grabbing
number three that goes above it you hang
on to that and you pull it tight so see
how that's just hanging there and then
you're gonna do the same to the other
side so number five which is the
furthest goes over number four over
number four under number three which is
hanging there you're gonna grab number
three now with your finger and pull that
went to the other side and let number
five drop in the middle so now number
five becomes number three so again
starting on this side the one that's
closest to your face goes over the one
right next to it under the one that's
hanging and then you drop that one and
you grab the one that's hanging and you
pull it tight like that so this is the
one that was just closest to your face
and it's now hanging so from the back
again
you go over under the hanging one and
then that one becomes the hanging one
and then you pull the hanging one I hope
you guys can see what I'm doing I just
practice it a bunch of time and so it's
become easy for me it's just hard to
show it tutorial because I don't have a
mirror I'm just looking at the
viewfinder not the best idea okay so
this one over under the hanging one
and then that becomes a hanging one and
this becomes right there
over under hole
over-under pull the more you do it the
easier it's gonna be like right now I
mean it seems pretty simple but it's cuz
I practice it so many times oh my gosh
I don't know if you guys can see this
this is what it's looking like right now
intricate braid by five pieces and go
this one goes over then it goes under
the hanging line which is the middle one
and that becomes a hanging one and this
one becomes the one that's over here you
can drop that and then the outside over
under pull that pull take your elastic
and you just tie it off
this is what it ends up looking like
it's super cool super thick and then I
like to pull out some pieces like on top
and on the side because I don't like it
very tight and again with this hairstyle
you can always pull it out but I kind of
like the sleek look just of the braid
itself um and yeah that's just how you
do it pretty simple if you guys have any
questions about these braids please
leave them in the comments below I don't
know if I did a great job of explaining
but I mean there are so many tutorials
out there on YouTube that you can search
I'm sure there's someone who is like a
master hair braider that can show you
how to do this better than I can if you
try this out please please please tweet
me images of your hair I really want to
see how it looks my Instagram is right
here you can go follow me and I just
really like being interactive with you
guys or you can send them to me on
Instagram but you have a better chance
of me seeing them on Twitter because
I've just got a lot of notifications on
histogram and stuff and it's hard to
check everything but I'm Twitter
definitely I will see it and I will
respond to you and it's always fun to
see you guys trying out my techniques
and yeah I'm sorry again if I have a
raspy voice or anything again getting
over a sickness and also don't forget to
let me know in the comments if you are
interested in seeing me vlogs and some
exciting things coming up because I just
think it would be super cool to start
vlogging and showing you guys like
behind the scenes kind of things and I
don't know I just think it would be a
lot of fun so let me know and also don't
forget to give this video a thumbs up to
show your support and oh yeah one more
thing do you guys want to see an outfit
