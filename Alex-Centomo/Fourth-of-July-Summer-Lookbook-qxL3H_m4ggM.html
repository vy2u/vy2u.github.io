in Maine United States right now because
I'm here for the fourth of July weekend
and I thought what better than to film a
fourth of July lookbook for you guys
because I get so many requests to do
this even though I'm Canadian I have a
lot of American followers actually
you're my majority of my followers you
guys are from the States so I thought I
would show you what I would wear and
what I did wear on the fourth of July so
I have four outfits for you guys and I
want you to comment down below and let
me know which one you would most likely
wear to the fourth of July like picnic
or a party or whatever you guys are
doing and of course everything will be
listed down below so let's just get into
it
thirty
this man
me
she used to know
no Monsieur while you landed baby
so I hope you guys enjoyed that video if
you did make sure to give it a big
thumbs up because that makes me happy
also it's super loud and crazy right now
because everyone's celebrating for the
long weekend so I'm gonna go and
continue celebrating and subscribe if
