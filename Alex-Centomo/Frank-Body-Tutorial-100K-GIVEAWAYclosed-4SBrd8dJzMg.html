hey guys I'm here today with my sister
Kyla and I'm sure you guys all know who
she is based off my Instagram pictures
today we decided to do a kind of Frank
body tutorial like I don't know if you
guys have heard of Frank body coffee
scrub but we're huge fans of the brand
so I decided to get a package and then
test it out I've been using it for a
couple months I love it and I use it
before I self tan all the time so we're
just outside right now at the pool and
we figured that we would do a little
step-by-step tutorial on how we apply
this it's pretty simple but a lot of
people requested it so I hope you guys
enjoy it and don't forget to go follow
her on Instagram because she's almost at
10,000 followers subscribers so if you
guys are interested in seeing how we
applied this stuff and how we got dirty
with Frank then just keep on watching
yes this is not a sponsored video this
sounds very sponsored right now like
let's see us get dirty with Frank how
leg cramp ooh
I ran yesterday for like 45 minutes and
I have a leg cramp oh my god okay so
let's go say it
step 1 get in the pool or the shower or
the bath get wet so here's Kyla in the
pool just rinse in her body look creepy
step 2 okay step to take out Frank
step three apply to the body so Kyle is
just rubbing it in circular motions all
over her body massaging it into her skin
just exfoliating like you normally would
make sure you're getting every inch of
your arm your elbows everything you want
to focus it on the dry spots and also
make sure if you're doing it outside to
stand somewhere where you're not gonna
get ya become dirty and also if you want
this product is really good with stretch
marks and cellulite Kyla is lucky enough
to not have any of that stuff but if you
want to focus it on your bum and your
legs then that would be great as well
it feels so good I feel like I'm just
getting all the dry skin
step four you just want to make sure to
let it sit for ten minutes so it's all
over her body now and she's just gonna
wait it out and let it dry and then
you're just gonna rinse it off after so
I hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial
um we just really like doing it's pretty
simple and straightforward but you guys
