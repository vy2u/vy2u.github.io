channel I am kind of over the moon right
now because I got to attend Paris
Fashion Week this for me was one of
those pinch me moment because it was a
dream come true and I was so grateful
for it so I just want to say a huge
thank you to L'Oreal for sending me
there because I don't think I would have
ever experienced this the way I did if
it wasn't for them this video is in
collaboration with L'Oreal so thank you
so much but this would not be possible
that of you guys so seriously thank you
I got to live a dream like sitting in
these fashion shows I know just some
people might not seem like anything
crazy but for me I don't know a lot of
my friends and people my age it's just
like a dream come true to be able to go
to Fashion Week especially in Paris and
see the shows that I got to see oh ma
Isabelle Marah Kenzo like oh my gosh I
was just I was really happy and I'm
really grateful so I wanted to kind of
talk about my makeup talk about the
makeup that I saw I haven't makeup done
before each event by the L'Oreal team
and I learned a lot about makeup in
general a lot about what the looks they
were going for and also talking about
the new products that L'Oreal has come
out with because I did use them on my
face today
it's a beautiful natural glow a look and
that was mainly what I saw on the runway
very youthful very glowy natural and I
will have all the product list down
below for you guys if you want to check
it out for yourself so you guys can see
exactly which products I used and if you
want to purchase them totally feel free
and if you are new here make sure to
give this video a thumbs up to let me
know if you guys like get ready with me
and if you want me to do more and also
subscribe down below and turn on your
notifications if you're new here and
join the fam and without further ado
let's just get into this video okay I
just made sure to moisturize my face
like entirely because my skin is very
dry right now as you can see I have a
bit of redness from my rosacea as well
as I had a treatment not too long ago so
this is my skin without anything I'm
going to be starting off with this
primer from L'Oreal it's seen fallible
glow LOC and this does add a little bit
of a glow
lore'l does have a new lineup for their
True Match Lumi collection there's four
different products in it and one of the
things I really noticed on the runway
this season was how glowy everyone's
skin was like sheep bones highlight just
on fleek got the little like cute
highlight on the nose and the Cupid's
bow it was just very like wow the skin
just looks so youthful and glowing
beautiful radiant whatever those words
are and what's great about this new line
I'll show you guys in a second is that
there's four different options with four
different textures and shades that are
kind of customizable for what you want
to get done with your makeup and they
have all different intensities so you
can choose how much you want to blow up
blow up get it because when we glow so
the first one I'm gonna be using is this
one this is the lumi glow shine i
actually posted a picture with this on
instagram with my highlight showing and
so many of you guys commented in DME
about it because you said it looked
insane which it does it looks really
nice and it picks up beautifully on
camera but what's really nice about it
is that in person it's not too crazy
like you don't look like you just have
some insane mirror face i'm just going
to apply a tiny bit of this all over the
areas where i want to glow and I did
notice that the makeup artists that were
helping me do my makeup would always use
this on my face right before applying
any foundation and they were telling me
that it just adds so much radiance to
your face so okay I didn't even show you
guys the product so that was the first
one and then there's these three after
that this is the lumi glow Amul this is
a glow busting drop this is brilliant
tense I like to mix a tiny bit of this
in with my foundation and then you have
the True Match Lumi shimmer ista and
this one is good to add a little bit on
top of your foundation as a highlight
and like here and here and then as for
this this is the True Match Lumi glow
nude it's a highlighter palette so you
can see two different shades but I
actually like to use this on my eyelids
as an eyeshadow because it does fit in
the look all together so let's get
started I just
have my foundation on my hand I'm gonna
add a tiny little bit of this stuff can
see it's like super shimmery just a DAB
I suggest a beauty blender for this just
because it adds the most natural look to
your skin it applies the product on
really well and make sure your Beauty
Blender is down making sure I get my
ears and you want to go down your neck
underneath your jaw cuz you definitely
don't want a line so obviously right now
it's looking very washed out on camera
but don't worry we're going to be adding
a ton of contour and highlight to give
dimension back to your face and I also
just want to say that I am NOT a makeup
artist but this is what I learned while
getting my makeup done and also what I
saw on the runway what I saw the models
wearing and how I would apply it for
myself being a normal person that is not
a makeup artist and doesn't really know
what they're doing so hopefully you guys
can recreate this so another tip that I
learned from a makeup artist is to make
sure you're setting your foundation in
the right places he suggested that you
only add powder to the areas where you
need to set and then you add your
highlight and your bronzer instead of a
powder that way it's adding less
products to your face but the powder of
the highlight and the contour is still
setting your makeup whereas just the
setting powder itself is going in the
places that need it and that's it so
obviously putting on less makeup the
better because the less cakey it will
look you don't want to just like pile
everything on your face and none of them
ever baked my face so I'm just gonna do
a tad underneath my eyes this is just
regular setting powder a little bit on
my forehead chin down my neck now I'm
using the Lummi shimmery stuff this is
the illuminating highlight powder have a
little bit in the cap and I'm going to
be applying it with this brush oh my
gosh I really hope this camera picks it
up properly I'm singing in front of my
window so it's like not professional
lighting but I think you guys could see
a little bit of it and he actually went
a little under my eye as well they
always do the tip of my nose and Cupid's
bow going in with more of a flattop
I'm going to apply that color all over
my eyelid then with the orange II shade
and more of a dome type brush going in
the outer corner up into my crease the
natural glow as well as the hollowed
eyelids it looked really beautiful on
the runway plus it's easy to recreate
because it doesn't look too intense you
can actually wear this look out to a lot
of different places this shade is a
little darker focusing this in the outer
corner just lightly dusting it you
almost are going in like a what is this
like a triangle this way so you're gonna
go up to your crease and then into the
crease a tiny bit like that so see how
it brings my eye up a little bit on the
outer corner that's the look we're
trying to get with this shade and then
you are going to blend it out because
you don't want any harsh lines then I'm
going to add a tad bit of bronzer right
to my cheekbones and then bring it up
onto your temple I'm just bringing the
color down my neck to blend everything
in together and to add some shading
under my chin a little bit under my lip
eyebrows were so all over the place on
the runway I think it depends on the
models eyebrows it also depends on the
look they're going for but in all fuller
eyebrows are nicer so girls or boys do
not over pluck your eyebrows please
because you are not going to be happy
when they never grow back like me I'm
gonna be light with my strokes want to
do little strokes as if you're adding
little tiny hairs and this is the part
where I suck at the most when it comes
to makeup so if you even subscribed to
me for a while you know how much I suck
at eyebrows so just bear with me
actually this shade is not too bad
mascara guys this mascara is my new holy
grail oh my god
yes this is amazing it makes it look
like I'm wearing falsies but I'm not
wearing fall season I also didn't have
to put like a crazy amount of time and
effort into putting on falsies because
this just gives it the same look so this
is the new voluminous super star X fiber
mascara it has a dark so like a black
primer on one side which looks like this
and then it has a fiber side for the
step two which adds Tyl fibers to the
primer and makes your eyelashes super
long beautiful like as if I got my
lashes done I'll show you guys in a
second it just gives my lashes extreme
volume and extreme length which is
always a plus for me so starting off
with the first side and it's labeled two
so you know which side is which with the
primer I'm gonna do one eye and then I'm
gonna show you the difference between my
one eye that's done versus the other one
and then second side guys ready for this
look at that that is no eye liner
nothing that is just mascara that's just
insane look at the difference of my eyes
with just mascara
then the last thing lips obviously
because you don't want them to just like
be invisible just going to align them
first so I can get a good shape I like
to go a little bit outside of my lips
and ask for lipstick I fell in love with
this first of all the packaging how
pretty is this looks like a little
crystal and this is in the shade this is
the color riche shine in the shade 642 I
don't know what the name of it is but
I'll have it linked down below this
exact color the consistency of this is
in sane it's so luxurious it tastes good
don't eat it but like when you put it on
mmm it tastes so yummy it's so creamy so
it actually really moisturizes your lips
and I really liked that because I was
actually using this as the lip balm the
whole time because it does give a color
as well I believe there's 12 shades in
total its unique non wax formula so it
actually glides on your lips really
beautifully because there are six times
more clear natural oils in the formula
like you saw only had to apply it around
once and it adds so much color and look
at this and this is the finished makeup
look very glowy very dewy very youthful
now as for hair the looks I saw were
very basic and actually really easy to
recreate so one of the things that I
noticed was that a lot of the girls had
their natural hair and one of the things
I did notice was that none of the girls
had any flyaways so using a hairspray to
make sure that your hair does stay in
place because as you can see I do have a
ton of flyways even if I take these out
my hair is pretty frizzy so one of the
tricks that I like to do is using a
hairspray with my fingers and this is
actually something that I was taught
they did my hair pretty natural for the
most part except for one time they did
loose waves but they really liked the
way my natural hair looked and I guess
that was kind of the theme of the whole
fashion show one of the main things that
they do backstage for Fashion Week is
making sure to use a hairspray that adds
hold but also can like disappear with a
stroke of a brush this one which is the
Elnett satin L'Oreal Paris hairspray is
so good you use it it gives amazing hold
but then if you just comb or brush out
your hair it completely disappears and
you can restyle your hair into something
else and it doesn't leave your hair like
crispy or crunchy it feels really nice
it's really soft to the touch so like
it'll give long-lasting hold but still
feel really nice
so this is what they would do just to
get rid of my flyaways especially in
certain lights you can really see them
so I'm pretty sure what the guy told me
was that Oh expert am i I don't do that
it was that this hairspray actually
envelops every strand like strand by
strand and leaves it really smooth and
does not leave it sticky or stiff just
really nice that's it so I hope you guys
enjoy this video don't forget to check
