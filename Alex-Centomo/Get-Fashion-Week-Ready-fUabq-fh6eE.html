channel if you guys don't follow me on
any social media then you probably won't
know but every year for the past three
years I've attended New York Fashion
Week and I'm really excited because this
year I'm also going to London Fashion
Week but I thought I would make a video
all about how to get Fashion Week ready
or like any sort of Fashion Week ready
kind of based off of what I've seen
models wearing and blah blah blah so
with Fashion Week normally what I do is
I compile outfits for the full time that
I'm there and then I kind of do like an
outfit per day and I style it beforehand
and then I bring it with me to New York
or to London I thought that I would show
you my top essentials for things that I
do to get ready when I'm away cuz
obviously I love to wear a lot more
makeup than I normally would on an
everyday basis and I feel like fashion
month is like a big statement time
fashion beauty hair all of that like all
the brands go crazy everyone's dressed
up everyone you can like we're totally
crazy things and people are just like oh
she's there for Fashion Week so I mean
you can wear crazy things any day of the
week if you want it to but me personally
I don't I kind of compiled a bunch of
products and things that I'm going to
talk about I haven't left yet for New
York but when I'm there I'll be bringing
these with me and I will definitely be
using these all the time I think the
first thing I want to talk about are my
teeth so I get a lot of questions on how
my teeth get so white so recently what I
have been loving are the crest 3d white
strips and these are the luxe brand so
they're the strong grip no-slip what I
like about these is that they don't hurt
my gums slash teeth so what I like about
the Flex fit and this is the reason why
I got these ones in particular they
allow the white strips to stretch and
mold to your actual teeth so they can
custom fit your teeth and all the
grooves and all the spaces and if you
have like I have a crooked front tooth
it molds around that so that there's not
like a random yellow streak in the
middle and it just does not budge which
is really great because then I can go
about do my business do my you know
laundry fold whatever make my bed clean
my room
it also provides 30% more coverage to
whiten teeth so more of your teeth get
covered by the actual white strip I find
personally it whitens just as well as a
$500 in office treatment I know people
that have personally gotten those and I
think these just do it exactly the same
so in reality it's not really worth the
money personally but when you can just
get these and it gives you like the
exact same treatment and I really like a
lot with fashion week come fashion shows
obviously but they are obviously the fun
parties and events that or dinners that
you can be invited to and sometimes
those go on really late I remember last
year there was a party last year that
carry tests cat Kareem and I went to and
we walked in and there's just like a
bunch of celebrities there and we were
just like okay but it's just a lot of
parties and events like that so you end
up staying out kind of late you guys
know I don't drink but I still have fun
I love to dance I love to just be with
my friends and stuff so it was a really
fun time obviously did not get much
sleep that night so things like this
come in handy this is the Olay ultimate
eye cream it helps with dark circles
puffiness as well as wrinkles I really
like this for the mornings when I don't
get much sleep because I do get dark
circles so it helps with that and also
thing I like most about this though is
that when I apply it
it instantly evens and brightens my skin
and it just gives it a really nice glow
which is perfect for under the eyes it
makes me look awake and I'm ready to go
on for my next day which is probably to
be jam-packed but it's it's good looks
like I had like the best sleep ever
so the next thing deodorant you guys
know smelling good is probably the best
thing ever you don't want to stink and
when I am running around all day doing
things that tends to happen TMI whatever
I'm a human being it happens so I like
to wear something that will make sure
but that does not happen so this is the
secret clinical deodorant it's the
invisible solid I like this because it
doesn't you know like sometimes you put
deodorant on and it has like the white
residue and it gets all your black
clothes I love black especially for
fashion month and I do not want
any of that on my black clothing so I
always choose this for that type of an
event I really like it also because it
stays dry another thing with this and
this has to do with smell is that it
actually traps voters and locks them in
and then kind of releases them with
something that smells a lot better it
works really well for me and I love it
yeah makeup is another kind of bold
statement you do during fashion month
it's not all about the fashion it's
about the hair it's about the makeup all
that jazz so the first thing I want to
talk about was the covergirl true Naked
Roses palette I love this palette so
much I normally use the nudes but the
Roses has been kind of a new thing for
me and I'm wearing it on my eyes today I
love it so much
so each palette there's eight uber
blendable shades and with the palettes
that are three so there's the nude the
roses and the golden the shades are
perfect for any skin tone and they offer
a multiple highlighter base crease and
liner options per palette which is
really good they also provide a really
smooth texture they go on their super
blendable really pigmented I also really
like it cuz they're pretty neutral
shades but they are from like a pale to
a deep color and they offer a range from
a nude eye to a smoky eye you can have
either a matte finish or shimmery finish
which is really fun as well because some
days you want to go matte some days you
want to go shimmery and you can just
bring this thing in your small makeup
bag and you don't have to worry about a
bunch of eyeshadows it gives you an
amazing range then on to it lips I have
been loving this one it's the katie-cat
matte lipstick it's covergirl and Katy
Perry it's their line together so this
is in the shade sphynx and I really love
this so much I've been using this for a
few months now but I just think I'm
gonna be rocking this lip because it's
just so neutral and perfect so it's
highly pigmented
it's Debbie matte so it's perfect it's
not too drying and not too glossy it's
just like a velvety smooth finish and
it's super nourishing there's like shea
butter in it it just feels really nice
on and Katy Perry actually helped design
all of the colors they range from like
black they have a dark one to like a
really cool violet color but I just
think this one in particular is
because I'm wearing on my lips today I
just think it's all around you can do
any eye look with it and it looks great
then the last thing I want to talk about
is this this is the Pantene air spray
and I raved about this like past I don't
know eight months I just love this so
much I use it all the time it's really
great for any kind of hair style you do
and hold your hair in place but it
doesn't feel crunchy you can still kind
of like move your fingers through it I
have so many hair tutorials on YouTube
using this if you guys want to check
them out it's just it's I just this is a
Holy Grail product for me right now so I
love it actually went through like three
or four bottles of these already and I
really like it cuz it's the first
aerosol alcohol-free hair spray I hope
you guys get a bit of a sense of what I
like to do during fashion month if you
guys don't attend these type of events I
hope it gives you a little bit of
insight of what I like to do and
obviously you could still use these for
I don't know like events you can use
them for parties anything you're doing
on the weekend it doesn't have to be
strictly this it's just what I like to
do yeah I hope you guys enjoyed the
video I will have all the links listed
down below with everything that I can
find direct links for you guys don't
forget that I love you guys all so much
and I will see you guys all in my next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
