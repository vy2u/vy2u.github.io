video on my channel weird arm things
what's up guys so it is a beautiful
sunny day
I am super hyper right now it's like 8
a.m. and I'm just like I feel I'm
feeling energized so I feel like filming
a video for you guys if you guys didn't
know in the Year 2015
I've been really really trying to eat
healthier and just really work on my
diet and you know working out and my
lifestyle everything like that it's been
like a big change because I was like
into eating kind of junk food and stuff
before and you guys are all very curious
about it if you didn't know I'm huge
into teas and into tea toxins and all
those things you guys have seen it
before my channel and stuff I'm always
like looking for the new like trendy
thing and my last video that I posted I
got like an overwhelming amount of
emails to try out this tea because I had
mentioned that I wanted to I was looking
for new tea a lot of you guys wanted me
to try out skinny mint tea and so what I
did was I actually went on an Instagram
account and like went online a little
bit and did some stalking and I looked
at reviews and stuff and like through
their pictures and their hashtags and I
actually really was curious I ordered
the 28 day detox this is the morning
boost one so you have this in the
morning and then I got also the 28 day
detox this is the nighttime one this one
you actually drink every other night but
this one you have every single morning
and the last video I did was a what I
ate today video and you guys saw that I
was having these teas and I asked you
guys if you want to see more in depth
video about the teas and you guys all
said yes that's why I'm doing this video
but basically I have been doing this for
around two weeks two and a half weeks
and I have been loving it and the reason
why I started doing this one is because
okay this is kind of embarrassing do you
guys follow Tasha Oakley on Instagram
like she's part
a bikini a day and she's Australian and
she's got like this bod is just like I
don't know I just really really want
Tasha Oakley abs and I know that you
can't just like drink tea and get abs
like that like you need to like work out
and eat healthy too but I already do
that I just want those abs so the thing
that sold me the most about this tea
than any other tea was the fact that it
said burns
fat and that's really like guess sold me
over the other ones the other ones
really say it but I really see a
difference and this over the other ones
and especially like the reviews I was
reading from a lot of you guys actually
and a lot of people online just like
random people were saying that this
helped the most in that way and I'm not
like trying to like lose weight or
anything like that's not really what my
intentions are I just really want to
tone my stomach like I want the hose abs
so bad they're so hot and especially
because I've been traveling so much
lately I just
I want that bikini bod okay guys that's
just like my thing right now I'm just
getting ready for summer weather on the
28 day detox or tea talks the morning
boost it says increases energy burns fat
and reduces appetite and actually it
really does like I look really hyper
right now I just had my tea and normally
I have the tea before I work out and
then I'll have breakfast afterwards you
can have it with breakfast you can have
it without breakfast like before you eat
breakfast but I find having this right
in the morning it doesn't make me feel
like I'm starving sometimes I wake up
with like a really big appetite and my
stomach is like eating itself you know
that feeling where your stomach it's
just like growling so much and you just
eat so much because you're hungry this
like doesn't I have this tea and it
takes that away it's awesome but I mean
I still do have breakfast I don't skip
breakfast
good it's all natural ingredients hid in
here it's organic it's really good for
you it says in the back our promise is
most effective scientifically developed
herbal blend fresh and tasty unique
package guaranteeing long lasting
freshness and flavor and then highest
quality it's 100% natural blended in
Germany and if you like look at these
bags they're like little um mesh bags
with like obviously the little uh little
string to put in your in your tea it
smells so good I don't add anything to
the tea I just literally pour hot water
into my mug and drink it like that you
can add funny if you want but I find the
taste of this is just amazing on its own
and I don't know I love the energy this
gives me like I'm really hyper right now
but it's not like a caffeine hyper it's
not like jittery
I just feel energized like I feel like I
can run a marathon right now like that's
literally what it is this does contain
caffeine and if you guys do know I'm not
a huge fan of caffeine but it's not I
consider this not coffee caffeine like I
don't feel the same way so when I have
coffee or like when I have an ice cap
from Tim Hortons I get that like jittery
feeling this doesn't do that that's just
like I said gives me energy for the rest
of the day
so it is I do recommend that you don't
have this at night because then you'll
probably just be awake all day oh I mean
all night and not be able to sleep so I
love this and then for the nighttime T
this I have every other night it says on
the package it reduces bloating improves
digestion and loses weight I love this
it's awesome this does do the cleanse to
your body it does like get out all that
excess stuff if you know what I mean but
it's not like it's not like taking
laxatives pills or anything like that
like I would not recommend that to you
guys and what I love is this does not
make you feel sick at all
it doesn't no I don't feel sick you guys
know in my phobia with BOM and all that
stuff it doesn't make me feel sick so I
love it so this is all natural
ingredients as well I I really like this
it helps me sleep better and
just feel more rested the next day and
then I kinda it's like a cycle you know
so I have this every other night I don't
recommend having this every night you do
want to follow the instructions but I'm
hoping that maybe in a month I will have
those ABS I've been doing a lot of ABS
lately and just working on my core if
you didn't know my boyfriend Daniel is
becoming a personal trainer so he's
training me and I don't know if you guys
are interested in seeing a video on that
let me know down below in the comments
but if you guys are curious about this
brand I will leave links double in the
description that you can check out as
well as their Instagram account and you
can also just use the hashtags that you
can see like people's results so I'll
leave those hashtags right here and you
can see actual people's results of using
this tee and I think what I'm gonna do
is probably on my blogging channel I'll
like keep you guys updated throughout
this experience because it's it's only
been about two and a half weeks I
definitely notice results but I'm
wondering what its gonna look like after
28 days because that's what it says 28
days so if you guys are curious as to
seeing an updated thing let me know in
the comments below if you have any other
questions let me know because I know
that a lot of you guys are curious about

curious I'm trying a lot of them but I
think by far out of every single one
that I've tried this has to be my
favorite I'm not just saying that you
guys know I'm 100% honest with you I
actually love this I recommended it to
my sister and to Carina and like I said
