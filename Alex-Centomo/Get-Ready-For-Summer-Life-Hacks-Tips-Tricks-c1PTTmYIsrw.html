gave my
what's up everyone welcome back to my
channel guys it's like summer outside
where I'm from finally we went from like
winter straight to summer weather we had
zero spring which is kind of typical
where I'm from we don't really get much
of like the in-between seasons even
though I feel like we used to when I was
a kid whatever so I have been talking
about this for a while on me and Anne's
vlogging channel just like how I just
had this idea to make this video kind of
about what I do to get ready for summer
I'm not in school but I remember when I
was in school I feel like it was such a
hard transition to go from being in
school studying all the time for exams
to like not having anything to do and
you're just like what do I do with
myself like oh my god and then all of a
sudden you have to like be in a bikini
and be outside by a pool or by a beach
and shorts tank tops everything like
that and like how do you prepare so I
just thought I would give you some of my
favorite things I used to like to do to
like prepare myself for summer obviously
this is not like a mandatory thing it's
personal preference but it's just things
that I like to do to get ready and that
what I like to do for the summer like I
do this throughout the summer but
especially before you'll see what I mean
in a second so I'm going to talk about
products and then at the end of this
video I'll just give you like one of my
favorite things to wear for like this
time of year when it's in between almost
summer weather not entirely and yeah so
the first thing I like to do when I'm
getting ready to wear my shorts wear my
bikinis you know take off the leggings
or the sweat pants and expose my legs is
shaving
I think shaving your legs is like the
first thing that most people do when it
is time to wear shorts outside or in my
case one of the first things I do
because I have gone a bit of time
without shaving my legs and they just
were like little caterpillars and it was
you know the thing and it took me
getting like attacked by drone to be
able to see that I need to shave them
because I look down at my legs and I was
like yeah that's a thing so ho getting
ready for the summer I'm getting ready
to wear shorts I like to shave I don't
do like laser treatments or waxing on my
legs I've always just been someone
my legs always always always this is one
of my favorite razors it's the Venus
swirl the purple line it says contours
better no tricky areas for a flawless
shave and I really like these shavers
because they don't cut me at all and
it's really easy to shave over my Nate
my knees over my knees and like behind
my knees and stuff I always had an issue
with cutting my knees and I don't know
why because I would do everything to try
not to cut my knees and they would just
always cut but I found just like with
this razor it glides perfectly does not
cut me does not hurt and I just really
like it a lot
plus it's one of those that like you
could take the top off here I'll just
open it - you guys could see this is a
new one that I just got so like it has
the little like holder thing and then it
comes with two of these heads these are
pretty standard like I feel like
everyone knows about these razors but
they're just one of my favorite ones
yeah I just like the way that it's like
super smooth and it's easy to get to
hard to reach areas so yeah and then
when I shave my legs and this is
something that my mom always told me to
do and I actually have a few friends
that don't do this and I don't know how
because they have like the worst razor
burn ever but I always make sure to use
a shaving gel and I just think this is
like so important because not only does
it help you like shave better and see
the places that you're actually shaving
so that you don't miss spots but this
one in particular this is by Olay
it's the violets world kind of just goes
along with the razor this actually
leaves like um what's the word I'm
looking for it moisturizes your legs so
as soon as you're finished shaving it's
not like you just wiped it away and it's
gone it leaves like a layer on your skin
that really helps moisturize your legs
and keeps them from like looking like
really dry and scaly and gross then the
next thing I do and this is typically
I'm kind of going in order from my
shower so the next thing that I would
typically do when I get out of the
shower is apply a self-tan and I like to
do this especially at this time of year
before I start actually being outside a
lot in tanning I like to not look pasty
white and where I'm from we don't get
much Sun throughout the year so then
when it's time for summer typically
people around here look very very pale
like snow white and there's nothing
wrong with being pale but from my skin
tone I look almost
see through and I just look sick like
people asking me if I'm sick when I'm
super pale so I just like to apply self
ten and the one I have at home is this
one I've had this for a long time I feel
like it's gross that I still use it
because it's old but it works so while
I'm wearing it today I don't know if you
can tell on camera if me like this
camera washes me out a lot but it's the
st. Tropez self tan dark bronzing lotion
I don't even think they sell this
anymore to be completely honest I don't
see saint-tropez in Sephora anymore when
I go in so I don't think that they sell
this one but I like it it works well but
once this runs out which is soon I'm
probably no go back to support and get
something else like another self ten
typically before I go on vacation I got
a spray tan which I like a lot better
because there's no chemicals or anything
and I feel like this probably has
chemicals and stuff but the one that I
get spray-tanned on me is like vegan
gluten free like really good it's just
natural but when I'm at home and I don't
have that much time to and I don't
really want to spend the money to get a
spray tan every time I just use this and
it looks fine so I like it and then on
top of that I when I let it dry and
everything I usually just use a
moisturizer but not just any moisturizer
I use this one in particular because
it's sparkly and it adds more of like
that glowy tan so I actually haven't put
it on yet because I'm wearing a white
shirt and sometimes it stains so just be
careful with that this is from Bath and
Body Works this is old as well I've had
this for like two summers because I only
use this in the summer and it's the Oahu
coconut sunset beach globe body lotion
and it basically it looks so gross I
don't know if you can see that that's
like Kristi it basically just adds
shimmer on your body so you can use
anything like that but I just like
having a look some on my shoulders like
all my arms my collarbone I put it all
over my legs so it's kind of sparkly and
it shines in the light and it just looks
like you have a bronze glow and it's
perfect for getting ready for summer
because you're not actually tan but you
look tan and you look ready for the
summer your legs are shaved and it's
awesome then I actually don't use any
self-tan on my face I just put a darker
foundation bless you to whoever sneezed
but then I like to for my hair this is
always how I do my hair in the summer
this is how I used to do it when I
worked at brandy and it's basically just
my natural hair coming out of the shower
what I do is I do two braids just on the
side I let it dry around 85%
just right making a random number
basically when it's like almost
completely dry and then what I do is I
go in with um just a sea salt spray this
one again is super old
it's from lush and I have been using not
this exact bottle this is like the
fourth bottle I purchased but um it got
really rubbed off when I put it in my
carry-on thing whatever we had this I've
been using for a very very long time if
you've been subscribed to my channel
since probably the beginning you will
know that it smells so good this is my
favorite smell in the entire world like
if this was a perfume I would wear this
it smells like an ocean like salty ocean
but like a really pretty fruity smell or
something oh my god I don't know this
literally smells like I love it I could
just smell it all day that sounds so
weird but it's true so what I do is I
take my hair out of the braids and then
I spray this in my hair and I kind of
just like scrunch it like that all over
and then this is my natural hair and
then what I do to be able to keep this
in place is I use just a hair spray and
this is the Pantene air spray hair spray
it's an alcohol-free hair spray so it
doesn't leave your hair feeling like
crunchy or anything like that and it
still has a lot of flexibility it still
feels really soft it looks really good
and I really like the consistency not
consistency but like the way that this
sprays onto my hair it doesn't feel like
hard hair spray like you still have
movement in your hair if that makes any
sense I don't know if that makes sense
does it you guys probably know what I
mean though basically what I mean by
that is that you can literally run your
fingers through your hair and it doesn't
like lose the hold or the shape of like
whatever style you did so even when I
curl my hair I use this after but I just
find this is really good because where
I'm from it does typically get more
windy and stuff so that's just a good
thing to have in general then the next
thing I always do when it's like getting
ready for summer is I work out a ton and
I start eating like extra healthy that
was my phone I'm so sorry oh my goodness
I mean I typically work out and eat
properly throughout the whole year
obviously I go through waves but I do
like work out extra hard when it comes
time to getting ready for summer just
videos I feel like oh my gosh I need to
get off my butt and like stop being lazy
I just need to do it and I just love
working out when the weather's nice if

love to do before and after my workout

below because I just filmed that or
put it right here and you guys can click
on this and it'll just take you to that
video but yeah that's just something
that I really like to do I'm thinking of
making like a healthy eating kind of
video of like meals that I love to do
that are you know typically very good
for you so you don't have to feel guilty
about eating them and just things that

think I'm gonna do that with my dad

recipes from him and he's just really
funny and like just he reminds me of
