channel I decided to film a holiday
inspired look for you today I did the
hair in the makeup and this look was
inspired by ariana grande I love her
look lately plus her new perfume Cape
just came out so I thought I would do a
look based all off of that so if you're
curious to see how I did this makeup and
his hair then just keep on watching
first of all huge thank you to Ariana
for partnering with me on this video
like serious goals the packaging is so
cute it's called sweet like candy and
the bottle itself is like amazing it's a
matte pink color and it's perfect and
chic the whipped cotton candy pom-pom is
so cute as well I just love it I just
think it's so Ariana the scent is
perfect for a night out it's
irresistible addictive and it's sweet
it's inspired by ariana seductively
sweet and sexy personality you can get
it at Ulta if you from the states or you
can find it exclusively at shopper's if
you're from Canada don't forget to click
the link in the description if you want
to find out more info and also don't
forget to check out the YouTube video
for Ariana's no perfume it's awesome I
just love it
on to the makeup I start off with always
a clean face moisturized because you
know it's winter you got to make sure
that your skin is nice and clean and
then I just use a primer to help kind of
fill out my pores Ariana has like
perfect skin so I got to make sure to do
that and then I just use a serum under
my eyes because they've been super dry
this month then going in with a bit of a
concealer to get rid of any redness I
want to make sure that my skin again
looks flawless and has is your redness
to it because our on the skin is legit
hashtag goals then going in with a
stippling brush I'm gonna put on a tiny
bit of foundation because I don't like
to wear too much in the winter it just
sometimes flakes on my skin so I want to
make sure it's light but still gives me
that coverage I need then going in with
a highlight this parts important because
it makes your skin glow look a lot more
young awake which is definitely a look
that Ariana supports a lot because her
skin is always looking very fresh and
alive
then the eyebrows which you guys know
the struggle for me but I tried to make
them kind of similar to Ariana's very
like bushy but messy natural looking
brows so I just brush them out and then
used a bit of like a color to kind of
fill them in as well as a brow gel to
keep them in place
then I want to make sure to set the
concealer so that it stays in all night
if you're using this for a night out
obviously gotta have that contour
contour is really important for this
look specifically because she does have
very high cheekbones so I'm making sure
to keep the bronzer and the hollows of
my cheeks as well as bringing it down
underneath my jaw on my neck and then my
temples to give me a tiny chiseled look
which she has a lot then a very simple
blush I'm gonna blend it all out to make
sure it's nice and evenly blended then
going in to do my eyes I'm just using a
base without my eyeshadow stay on all
day but this base itself is like a
coppery gold base then take any kind of
matte brown color that you have and
focus this in on the crease I have a
very small hooded eyes so I have to
really accentuate this look a lot to
give me that deeper type of look that
she usually wears but if you do have big
eyelids you don't have to go as intense
I make sure that I put a little bit of a
neutral shade just at the bottom of my
eyelid right above my eyelashes and this
opens up your eyelid a little bit but
again if you have really big eyelids you
don't have to do this step it's just
because I have smaller eyelids so I want
to make sure that you see the contrast
between the light and the dark shades
then going in with a dark grey / black
matte color could do any kind of dark
shade you want and I'm just focusing
this on the outer corner of my eye and
then blending it all together to make it
look like there's no harsh lines and
it's just like a natural gradient then
I'm going to do a small winged liner
because of course she always has that
winged liner going on so so hard to film
but I tried my best
of course you got to have the crazy big
lashes I actually don't have eyelash
extensions nor do I have false eyelashes
so I'm just making do with some mascara
but if you guys want to go more intense
you could totally do that adding some
highlight to give my cheeks that nice
glowy effect because it's so beautiful
especially at night time when the lights
hit your face at the right angles so
pretty and now on to the lips which I
think are one of the most important part
of the look her lips are always match
usually a pinkish or brownish shade so
beautiful so I'm actually over lining my
lips a tiny bit to make them appear more
fuller because she does have full lips
and then again using a nude brown / pink
shade I am just going in with that it's
a liquid lipstick so that it does dry
matte and doesn't move all night long
and I think this look is so beautiful
again you got the really classic winged
liner the really beautiful matte lips
kind of messy bushy eyebrows I just I
love it
onto the hair Ariana has been wearing
her hair pretty straight lately with a
bit of a wave and she usually always has
it up in a super tight high ponytail so
this is actually a really good tip if
you have second day hair which I usually
do because I'm park out all the time and
it's typically always greasy this will
make it look like you put a lot of time
and effort into your hair when actually
you just didn't shower that day put your
hair in a tight high pony she usually
has bangs but I don't have bangs so
we're just gonna make do with what I
have
and then an oversized sweater and a
choker and your look is complete
