channel as you could see my backgrounds
different I'm in my new house and I
actually don't know where I'm gonna be
filming so I'm gonna be testing out
different locations but I think this
looks cool I don't know whatever you
guys think let me know in the comments
so lately I've been feeling kind of like
if you're new to my channel hi welcome I
feel like in all my traveling I always
do it the same type of videos like a
lookbook or an output of who we could
get ready with me stuff like that and I
know you guys really like to see it and
I obviously like making these videos but
I feel like I'm in this like situation
where I just don't know what I want to
do video why it's like I'm not
I have no like new ideas I feel like I'm
just kind of repeating the same things
over and over again and like I see a few
comments people see me like oh my god
how many get ready with me do you have I
kind of didn't realize how many I made
because I love making them they're so
fun they're one of my favorite videos to
watch but if you guys have any
suggestions for things feel free to
leave them down below comments please
because I would love to create new
content for you guys that you guys want
to see I'm feeling kind of like I'm just
repeating my videos right now and I
don't really know what to do but this
was very requested so I did do it and I
had fun doing it so if you were curious
to see how I would get ready in Brighton
when I was there and how I do my makeup
everyday then keep on watching good
morning guys one of my vacation I tend
to like to sleep in and a lot of times
Donna will wake up and leave and I don't
know where he is so I kind of just curl
up with like my blankets or pillow and
like just cuddle up with it until I feel
like I absolutely need to get up and
once I do that I usually check the time
and I try not to go on my phone right
away like I literally check the time I
put my phone down and I like to get up
and get ready for the day right away or
else sometimes I'll find myself in bed
distracted on my phone for like an hour
and a half and it's really not good
yeah that's miss gotcha my but then off
to the bathroom this was such a cute
Airbnb we stayed at and Brighton it was
so nice and my mom joined us too which
is really fun so the first thing to do
to wake me up is wash my face
splashing water on my face really helps
to wake me up and energize me because
I'm very groggy in the morning and then
I go on to brushing my teeth because
that's super important and does this
ever happen to you guys were you just
like stare at a spot for so long and you
get comfortable staring there because
that actually helps me almost every
morning then on to moisturizer because
my skin is always so dry when I travel
and moisturizer is like my lifesaver on
to makeup so I like to our makeup when
I'm traveling it's so strange because
normally when I'm at home I don't wear
any makeup but when I'm traveling I tend
to wear almost a full face of makeup and
sometimes it's because I'm filming or
cuz I wanna you know do stuff where I
want to look decent but I don't know why
it's just kind of like one of those
things that I do when I travel when I'm
home I just never do it anyways the
foundation that I'm using is from Tarte
I really like it and this is the Too
Faced concealer that I just kind of put
all over it's very brightening so I like
that because like I said my skin is very
dry and it's strange because when I got
a facial she told me I had very oily
skin which it's never Olli it's like
always flaky so I don't get it then of
course eyebrows struggle you know you
know mean see they're a hit-or-miss with
this then of course to bronze up the
face cuz bronzer is so important when I
am very pale because I tend to look
really really sick and when I don't wear
any bronzer and I'm just like natural
and pale people always ask me if I'm
okay and it's like really bad I'm like
yeah it's fine I'm just not wearing any
makeup and yeah not that like you need
to wear makeup but I just feel like it
gives me a more youthful glow makes me
look more alive I'm also very sick right
now if you can't tell from my boy he's
add in that glow cuz that's so important
to get that like youthful skin non dry
look then on to mascara I actually
didn't apply anything out to my eyelids
and I don't know why I haven't been
doing that lately sometimes we'll put
like highlighter there or something but
for this time I did it
then lipliner which I actually really
messed up doing it and you know I'm not
a makeup artist I it's I try I try hard
and sometimes it's a fail but this is
generally what I like to do with my
makeup then onto hair this is just my
natural hair I wash it at night I sleep
on it and I leave it like that and I
just really like it I'm so sorry I'm not
doing my hair for this video but I just
really love my natural hair and I should
embrace it because you know you should
embrace your natural hair I just really
like it and check out all the mirrors in
the background they're really cool
then on to my outfit I first of all can
you just check out this view how
beautiful is that
but this jacket is actually vintage it's
her maze and I don't remember where I
found it but I loved it
then I'm just wearing a simple white
t-shirt with my Nike leggings and Adidas
shoes and socks which I totally was so
grateful that I had because I had such
bad blisters from this walk and then my
mom he came enjoying me this is so fun I
had such a great time with my mom this
trip really really just made a
relationship that much stronger and just
being with family was so amazing being
by the sea just really helps call me and
relax me and I realized feeling like
you're free is probably one of the best
things you can do or feel and I don't
know just looking at these views
thinking about life thinking about my
family my friends Daniel everything like
that just made me feel so grateful and
so happy that I have you guys in my life
and I just want to say big thank you to
you guys because you have no idea how
much you mean to me seriously I would
not be able to do anything that I'm
doing if it wasn't for you so thank you
from the bottom of my heart a million
times and now that I'm done being
emotional I do want to mention really
quickly that there is a chance that you
can meet me this weekend check out
Hollister's Instagram and my snapchat
for all the details on a chance to get
to meet me and this guy Sean O'Donnell
we're doing this scavenger hunt together
and don't forget that I love you I want
to hug you and squeeze you and say thank
you so much in person so I hope you guys
enjoyed the video we had so much fun
filming with a drone and I also didn't
realize that Brighton had so many cliffs

San Francisco and Notting Hill like it
