get ready with me real style today with
my blog camera
I literally just woke up put my glasses
on that's why I sound like this this is
me in line looking real cute then first
thing I do when I get up is I go and I
brush my teeth drink a glass of water
and head to the gym so we're going to go
do that
now to fill up some water
okay now we head over to my closet and
we pick out something to wear for my
workout this is what I'm dealing with
right now okay let's see these pants
perfect and then the rest is actually in
the bedroom
if you guys are curious to see what I
get up to at the gym I'll have a link
down below listed for you guys to check
out my workout routine video I actually
filmed when I was there and show you
exactly what I do how I lost weight all
that kind of stuff so be sure to check
that out if you want to see what I do
this is the current state look like fall
rainy fall spring back from the gym how
to take off my rain jacket because it's
raining april showers bring May flowers
right then so the first thing I do when
I get back is grab a protein shake
because after working out I think it's
really important so I'm going to drink
this then head to the shower okay so
basically when I come to the shower I
kind of pull out different products that
I want to use for the day and go based
off of that so the first thing I do
obviously is cleanse my face just
because I find like what's really been
helping my skin with breakouts and
keeping it a lot more like the texture a
lot better is causing it as soon as I
get back from the gym before I jump into
the shower and it just helps with like
all the sweat and build-up that's been
on my face I'm sorry as my glasses keep
reflecting so yeah I'll take those calls
for you guys um so the ones I've been
loving lately just because they're so
simple to use are these there by Olay
and I don't have the packaging right now
just because I like obviously recycled
it when I am check out the packaging
this is like my source boxes of meat
legit woah so you just take it out like
that super simple you wet it you lather
it up and then you rub it all over your
face I'll show you guys if you want it's
like super simple but these are the Olay
gentle daily facial cloths I think
that's what they're called I have like a
little thing here where you could see
the packaging that way if you guys want
to go buy it you'll know what it looks
like in every cloth is like the same as
liquid cleanser a toner a scrub of this
and an exfoliator a mask it's kind of
like all-in-one which I really like it
I'm sent in which is good as well
because I find with my skin sentence
sentencings tend to not do as well I
have very sensitive skin and this stuff
is works wonders plus it's really good
if you want to just bring it with you to
the gym and do it there but I live like
so close to mine that it's just so much
easier to do it here plus it's super
hydrating and so I was so simple then
you just rinse it off and you're good to
go
so now off to the shower this is the
daily moisture renewal you rheem air
conditioners and dream care shampoo ok
so I'm going to show you guys something
this right here this is what I deal with
on a daily basis maybe not daily but
like look it looks like a bird's nests
ok so I have kind of curly hair and very
naughty hair like I brush it and there's
the little tiniest bit of wind and my
hairs but not so this is why I picked
this shampoo finisher just because it
helps with this like so like look at
that look what is the deal is the sub
works wonders because it's really good
with detangling and that's kind of what
I need actually strengthens the hair so
that way like the next time I want to
wash my hair or the next time I brush on
my hair it doesn't break as much and I
really notice a huge difference the last
thing I do in the shower is usually like
exfoliate or wash Bob if you wash my
body but right now I have a spray tan on
so I don't need to do that literally
just wash my hair I just wash my face so
it's fine and then going to like
moisturize and do all that fun stuff
when I'm out of the shower
okay now that I am out of the shower the
first thing I do is I always moisturize
my skin because it's like the most
important thing especially for when you
live in a colder climate like I do I
live in Canada and it gets very cold
even though it's spring it's like ten
degrees Celsius max with a cold wind so
I need to make sure that my skin is
really hydrated and I just don't want
scaly skin like it's just not a good
look it's just not great I don't like it
I loaded up my whole body that's like
the first thing when I do when I get out
of the shower then I'm going to my face
so this is the one I'm in loving this is
the Olay Total Effects 7 anti-aging
moisturizer with sunscreen because the
Sun is stronger now since its spring I
really need to make sure to protect
especially my face because I have burnt
my face in the past really bad it's just
even if you haven't burnt your face like
to protect your skin it's just important
my face the sky my face is very
sensitive and reacts really bad with the
Sun so making sure I have an SPF all my
face which is this is SPF 30 so that's
really good but this moisturizer is
really good for protecting like the
surface of your skin and making it look
like firmer and stuff I'm not opposed to
because I definitely have struggled with
like pretty bad skin in the past and you
guys have really been noticing a huge
difference like this is me no makeup
like it's so much better than it used to
be even if you watch back my old videos
so I'm just like really been loving this
the consistency is really great it was
actually like the fourth bottle I'm
going through so this is the brand new
one like that that's good
I was just feel so good and then I like
to put some kind of cream in my hair so
this is what I've been using this is the
Herbal Essences 0% paraben coconut milk
oil infused cream that's a mouthful but
this is what it looks like it's really
good it smells amazing well I'll go into
the better lighting so you guys can see
so the main reason why I got this
product is because this right here
0% parabens gluten colorants so I also
just like it because it makes my hair
really silky and smooth and shiny
because it it's like oil infused so it
really helps to like protect the hair
especially if you're styling it with
heat which you guys know I don't do as
all of it all fit as I used to but on
occasion that I do I really enjoy
putting this in because it just really
does help to protect and you know how
important that is for me also it smells
really good it's like coconut vanilla
flowers I guess that kind of scent it's
just really really nice and it's perfect
for detangling
so this is what it looks like dry after
I put it in you can see now how like
shiny it looks and that's like nono
product that's just the only thing I put
in my hair there's nothing else to it
and it's just looking so much healthier
so much longer and yeah I really Oh
smell so good
I'm really happy with it also if you
guys are curious I'll have links listed
down below I always put links in the
description for you guys and I try to
put exact links so you guys can find
like the exact product so if you're
curious definitely go check it out let
me know what you guys think if you do
try any of these products let me know if
you have been using them let me know
what your thoughts are so for the rest
of the day it really depends on like
what I get up to so if I'm going to be
filming or shooting then I'll probably
put makeup on or if I have like a dinner
or like I don't know an event or
something open makeup on but on an
everyday real basis I don't wear makeup
just because I find that there's no need
for me to wear makeup like I just don't
need it in my in my life like all day
and I have noticed a huge difference in
my fuge difference in my skin when I
don't wear it on an everyday basis so
for example today I'm not doing anything
that like I need to wear makeup for and
also I now that I like need to wear
makeup ever but I'm just saying you know
like if I'm not shooting if I'm not
filming I'm just going to keep my skin
bare this is like legit my real morning
routine I my room is pretty clean I mean
like I just need to make my bed which I
probably won't do because let's be real
I don't make my bed every day and I'm
not going to fake it for to show what I
have my needle juices right here he's so
cute so I'm probably gonna watch a movie
with Dan and hang out
just chill I hope you guys enjoyed this
video I hope it was good if you want to
see like more details if you want to see
a makeup tutorial which I feel like I
have not done and so long and I've
really been wanting to do like a spring
/summer glowy makeup look that like I
like to do on an everyday basis that's
just super simple and like we're really
nice and looks looks like you're wearing
no makeup but you are
