getting ready with me so we're gonna go
through the makeup the hair the outfit
everything that I would normally wear
and do on a typical fall day so let's
get started the first thing I like to
start off with in the morning is my
cuddly cleansing water and this is
really good to take off any excess
makeup that I couldn't get off the night
before and it helps just clear up the
skin before I wash it just to get off
any excess dirt that accumulated
throughout the night
I then like to cleanse my face with my
new st. Ives green tea scrub and I
really like this one because it's less
abrasive than the apricot scrub so you
can use it more than twice a week and
since I have very sensitive skin it's
really really good for me because it
doesn't break me out or clog my pores
and it just really really cleanses it
really nice and gets deep into the skin
which I like
since my skin has been acting up like
crazy this month I've been using this
cuddly face serum and I really like this
because it helps prevent acne and
premature wrinkles and that's pretty
awesome then going in with my always
favorite a vino positively radiant daily
moisturizer I just really like this
moisturizer because it doesn't clog my
pores it leaves my skin really smooth
and definitely gets rid of that
flakiness that comes along with the
winter months if you catch my drift and
also have has SPF 15 in it which is
always a plus with moisturizers in my
opinion don't forget to brush your teeth
super-important in the morning and I
know a lot of people that skip this step
so don't because it's gross you then
following up with my Dior creme de Rose
lip balm and this is by far my favorite
lip balm I have ever used in my entire
life it just makes my lips super
moisturized throughout the whole day I
use it daily and nightly and it's just
amazing I love it okay on to the makeup
I forgot to film this step but I just
primed my face with my Smashbox
photo-finish light primer which I've
used in many videos before and now I'm
just taking my Beauty Blender and
applying my Chanel vitae Lumiere aqua
foundation in the color 20 phase all
over my face and then I'm just applying
concealer all over the places where I
have redness and blemishes and this is
the Mac Pro Longwear concealer in the
color NC 20 and then I'm just using my
Beauty Blender to blend that all in to
keep my makeup in place all day long I'm
using my Urban Decay D slick setting
spray which is always a favorite and
then just going in with some pressed
powder and applying that over the
foundation to make it matte looking and
keep it in place all day long and this
is my Revlon Photoready
so now onto the eye brows which I
actually suck at very much and I really
don't know what I'm doing I kind of just
take my benefit brow kit and just apply
it onto my eye brows yeah don't pay much
attention to this cuz I suck but I'm
definitely working on it and then I'm
just taking some clear mascara to set
them in place I also forgot to mention
yes Daniels in the background my video
he wouldn't move so yeah I just deal
with it so now I am taking my
hello tattoo and Bailey barely branded
and applying that all over my lid and
then taking my Stila eyeshadow and
kitchen and applying that all over the
lid and into the corner and underneath
brow I am then applying my Mac eye
shadow and Cory onto the outer corner of
my lid and bringing it into the crease
and then I applied some wedge into the
crease as well to deepen up the look a
little bit more because I found the
taupe is a bit too dark so if you go in
with a bit of a brown like this it does
deepen up a look but also softens it out
and then I'm going in underneath with
the quarry again just to deepen up the
look a little bit more if you are
interested in any of the brushes I am
using I got them all from Sigma and I
will have a 10% off discount code down
below if you want to check that out now
I'm just lining my lids with some Revlon
Photoready eyeliner whatever just use
any black eyeliner and then I am just
putting on some mascara you can choose
any mascara you want so on to bronzer I
love bronzer i'm using my NARS Laguna
bronzer to contour my face
I don't really like applying that much
throughout the colder months because I
do not want to look too orange but a
little bit of contour here and there
it's awesome and then I'm just applying
some Mac lady blush onto my cheeks I had
to cut the video a little bit because
you could see again but in the
background
it'll gross and then just blending that
out for the brush to give it a more
softer look
onto the lips my favorite part I've been
wearing a lot this color by Mac called
patisserie it's a really nice neutral
everyday look especially for fall it's
really pretty or if you want to go I'm a
bit darker side this one is by Revlon
and it's called plum velour it's really
dark really deep and I think it's really
really really nice for you know a night
out or whatever
oh gosh hair time my hair has been
looking so dull lately this is kind of
just second day hair so I'm just
brushing it out and then applying some
heat protectant spray bite resume to get
it ready for some heat because I will be
curling it and then just taking my
Conair one and a quarter inch curling
wand I will be taking little strands of
hair doesn't matter how thick or big we
are just kind of grab whatever and I
start twisting them around the barrel
and I don't twist the hair as I twist
around the barrel if you know what I
mean I kind of just keep it flat so it
gives a really nice curl I like to catch
the curl on my hand as I take it out the
barrel and let it cool down before I let
it go that way the curl kind of keeps
its shape and sometimes I like to you
know put the hair all over the actual
wand itself as I open the clamp or I
just put it all over the clamp it
doesn't really matter I just kind of do
whatever and then Here I am dancing and
being weird because that's just what I
do and then when it's all done I just
finger comb it and spritz some hairspray
into it you can use whatever hairy spur
you want and then of course forgot to
fill in this part but I just put some
dry shampoo in my hair because I was
looking a little greasy and a little
gross bouge scare you yeah onto the
outfit okay so I'm just wearing my fake
Doc Martens that I got from go Jane calm
I will link them down below if you're
interested and then I'm wearing these
burgundy jeggings jeans whatever you
want to call from a local boutique and
then my ray-bans that I wear almost
every single day and posted almost every
single picture on Instagram my jacket is
actually a vintage jacket that my dad
got in Italy a long time ago that I'm
kind of just stealing from him and
wearing because I think it's really cool
and oversized and I just really like it
a lot of course you got to add a beanie
because what is fall in winter without a
beanie
so this one is just a black one that I
got from urban outfitter is simple just
really nice and casual really cute and
then this top is actually super super
old from brandy melville from like years
and years ago it's got these button
detailing on it I just found in my
closet lately and thought it was really
cool so here's an overview of my outfit
