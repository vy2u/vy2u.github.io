get you feel like that out
good morning everyone
I hope that intro was as relaxing for
you as it was for me fall time is my
favorite time of the year I just always
feel so relaxed is the nature the change
of leaves the fall breeze the crisp air
the pumpkins Halloween everything just
makes me feel so happy and the fact that
I get to share it this year with boo and
Daniel makes me so excited boo is like
as a cutest thing and every morning I
mean usually Daniels in bed with me he's
not filming but usually in the morning I
have boo come upon the bed and he
cuddles with us for a little bit and
then starts to get a little rowdy so we
try and calm him down and if I'm not
working out in the morning I'll
typically bring him to the bathroom
because I like to shower first thing in
the morning he's so funny he always
tries to jump into the shower with me
and he loves the water it's the cutest
thing and I have not felt this happy in
so long you guys dogs are just such a
miracle heading over to my hair care I
love to apply oil to my hair as well as
heat protectant spray even if I'm not
putting any heat in my hair I find its
really good because it does have stuff
to protect your hair from the Sun and
then onto my makeup this is typically a
struggle because I like to do my makeup
on the floor but he always tries to
tackle me you guys know I don't do my
hair everyday but when I do I love
touring my extensions because it just
adds so much length and volume to my
hair these are my go-to extensions there
by luxy hair and there in the shade
blonde balayage from the seamless
collection there are custom length but
all the other lengths are so amazing and
I just find it looks so natural so many
people ask me a million questions about
my hair every time I wear these
extensions and I just feel so much more
confident when I'm wearing them plus
they just make my hair look
so shiny and healthy if you guys are
curious for your own set use the code
Alexson toma 5 and you can get money off
your first order and on this day Dan
Kyle and I went pumpkin picking I
actually logged it so if you guys want
to go over to my second channel you can
watch my vlog tober we're vlogging
practically every single day this month
and it was so much fun just to spend
some quality time with my sister and my
fiance just to go pumpkin picking I just
felt like so happy and like oh my gosh
oh of course I had to add in a few shots
from my drone because guys the nature
right now is unbelievable I am so
grateful to live where I do live and one
of my main goals for this year was to
kind of just like take time to relax
take time for myself stay off of
technology I know that's kind of strange
me saying this as I'm like uploading a
YouTube video but really just be in the
moment and appreciate the things around
me appreciate the people in my life it
just helps make me so much more
confident and so much happier in
everyday life and I really do suggest it
so I hope you guys enjoyed this video I
know it's a little bit different than I
normally do but this is a typical
morning for me if I'm not working out
and it's just something that I want to
share with you guys because I love you
and please let me know what videos you'd
like to see next and I'll see you all in
my next video I have a really really
relaxing day bye guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
