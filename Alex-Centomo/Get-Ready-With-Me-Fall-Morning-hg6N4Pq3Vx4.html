hotel room
baby I'm perfect for you what's up
everyone it feels so good to be back in
my house and back in my room because you
guys couldn't tell by the past two
months I have just been all over the
place with my travels and I am planning
on making a video all about my travels
how I travel what I do and all that kind
of stuff so if you guys are interested
in that just give this video a big like
and I'll do that for you but today I
figured I would do a get ready with me
video for the fall time because this is
my favorite time of year
fall fashion is like my favorite fashion
of all time where I live it gets very
cold so fall isn't that big of a window
so now I'm gonna have to be wearing
winter boots and sweatpants and just all
that stuff but I figured I would do
something quick for you guys so if you
guys are interested in seeing this video
just keep on watching good morning this
is me pretending to sleep peacefully
because I clearly don't but I've
actually been sleeping a lot with Lola
lately which makes me really happy this
is how I normally sleep just like all
over the place not happy not wanting to
wake up so usually every morning I
remind like 10 minutes because guys
really hurt when I wake up in the
morning check my phone for like two
seconds but I've been doing this thing
where I don't check my phone that much
in the morning which is actually really
good for you and then I normally cuddle
with Colt with Cola Oh with Lola and I
don't know it just makes me super happy
look at her what a dork
then I get out of bed which is always
the best feeling in the world to get up
in the morning right just kidding I've
been watching my face lately with this
thing I got from Sephora it's actually a
sample it's by this company called dr.
bend or bandit or something I'm actually
not too sure but this is like an
exfoliator that has been amazing on my
skin like amazing so I'm definitely
gonna go purchase the whole product
because it's incredible then I just Pat
my face to dry after I wash my face I
usually use toner this is by Kota Lee
and the girlfriend to Sephora told me
that it's really important to use toner
before you use any kind of moisturizer
or serum because it helps close your
pores so that way when you use your
serum it doesn't actually break you out
or anything it does what it's supposed
to do so I'm using just a serum and then
of course a moisturizer which is by dr.
bent or banded I don't know how to
pronounce it but I got this sample as
well which is so good for you what the
girl told me that it just like really
helps even out to the skin so I have
like combination skin dry and oily and
it just helps with that and then I just
apply a little bit of foundation I don't
wear much foundation actually don't
really wear makeup at all
but for pictures sometimes I like to
wear a little bit so I just use my
Beauty Blender and just a simple
foundation all over sometimes I'll use
concealers sometimes I won't but then
big secret that I do is that I literally
apply bronzer all over my face because
I'm so pale and for some reason no
matter what the foundation is just makes
me look extra pale so I got a bronze at
my face then just doing my eyebrows with
the anastasia brow thingy and i'm
getting better guys i'm trying really
hard but i really think I've mastered my
brows
somewhat then I just take some eyeshadow
like base thing and that's all I do in
my eyelids I don't do anything else I
just blend it out and actually this
weird thing that I've been doing lately
is kind of doing a deeper crease and
then wearing no mascara I know that
sounds really weird but I actually
haven't been wearing mascara and I
really liked it
so then I just pop a little bit of blush
on my cheeks to add some color to my
face
because I need to look alive then I use
some lip balm and this lipstick is by
Charlotte Tilbury and it's called nude
Kate it's really nice just a simple nude
and I really like the color of it as for
my hair I like to keep it natural
because you guys know me I never use
heat it's very rare that I do so I just
kept it natural like this and I don't
know I really like the way my hair is
looking lately I actually just dyed my
hair but you guys don't see in this
video it's just better ombre to be
honest as for my outfit this screams
fall to me look how cool this poncho is
so I got this from Free People and I'm
obsessed with their sweaters and
Poncho's and just everything this season
is like on point
I know Free People is pricey and it's
expensive but I do really I guess I
don't know splurge on Free People
because I really really like their stuff
and I've been buying three people since
I was probably 16 like I save up money
and buy their stuff because I'm obsessed
with it or I just steal my mom's these
shoes are by acne studios they're so
comfortable and they just look like
Harry Styles shoes so that's why I like
them and then I am wearing just ripped
jeans and of course my hair is natural
and look this is me posing like a weirdo
but yeah look at this poncho guys it's
like a turtleneck and it's so big and I
just like really really like it
