channel if you guys don't know really
anything about me or if you're new here
I love music festivals I love the
fashion I just love music in general but
I just love the whole atmosphere of it
and I usually attend like two or three
every year I try to go to as many as I
can and I got the opportunity to team up
with L'Oreal Paris to create a perfect
look for a music festival that's like my
own style I don't typically wear a ton
of makeup I like to keep it more
minimalistic but when it comes to music
festivals I like to kind of amp it up a
little bit more so I am showing you how
to do this look today very simple to do
literally can take ten minutes max and
that's the key about music festival if
you want it to be quick because you want
to be ready you want it to last all day
if you guys are curious to see how I
created this then keep on watching
starting off with the infallible Pro
glow 24-hour foundation I really like
this stuff because it lasts all day long
and when I'm dancing and in the heat I
need something that's gonna be on my
face as long as possible without
smudging or moving and also has a pretty
medium coverage which is perfect for my
type of skin it still looks like your
actual skin it doesn't look cakey or
anything like that
then going in with some concealer I like
to highlight the high points of my face
to make them look a lot brighter and
have me look a lot more awake so I just
kind of apply this all over the face at
the high points and then I just blend
them in with a Beauty Blender
once that's all done I go in with the
glam bronze bronzer for face and body I
actually sometimes put this on my chest
to make it a lot more bronzed and glowy
it's perfect for that I contour my face
as well as put it all over my face at
the end then going in with some
highlight which is actually a highlight
slash blush duo which is really good
because it's two in one and I put this
on my cheekbones as well as above my
eyebrows I then apply it on my brow bone
right under my brows to brighten them up
then going in with the nude 2 palette by
L'Oreal I kind of mix up the colors
every time I do this and it's great
because they're all very neutral tone so
it looks very natural and I focus in a
lot in my crease because I have very
hooded eyes I need to kind of accentuate
that or else it'll look like I'm not
wearing any eyeshadow at all so if you
do have hooded eyes make sure you go a
bit higher up on your brow bone as well
as in the creases of your nose
and then blending it all out using some
liquid eyeliner this stuff is amazing it
lasts forever it does not smudge and I
have again very small eyes so a lot of
times eyeliner will smudge because when
I blink or do anything it smudges this
stuff does not so that's great and once
that is pretty even I'm going in with
some mascara I like this because it has
the primer it actually makes my lashes
so long so as you can see here the
difference it's crazy I love it so much
then going in with some lipstick this is
the color rich 255 blush in plum it's
such a pretty color very natural-looking
and I love it it's not too extreme it's
pretty subtle but it's shimmery so it
looks perfect for any kind of festival
then for hair I'm just gonna be doing
very loose braids because I like to keep
my hair very messy looking for festivals
and I've been seeing this trend a lot
lately on Instagram so I thought it
would be perfect to do it for this look
so you want to braid your hair like a
normal braid but you don't want to go
all the way down
once you're around three-quarters of the
way you're going to put a clear elastic
on the ends and then mess it up as much
as you can and once that's all done
you're going to add a headband
and this is such a classic Alex look for
a festival I love this I would wear this
every single day if I could and this is
the completed look I hope you guys enjoy
it it's very subtle but just perfect for
an outdoor festival
so I hope you guys enjoyed the video if
you have any comments about anything
that I did leave it down below and also
if you are attending any festivals this
year let me know maybe we'll be going to
the same one and maybe we can meet up
also everything will be listed down
below if you guys want to check out all
the products I use and don't forget to
give this video a big thumbs up if you
enjoyed it I love you guys all so much
and I will see you all in my next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
