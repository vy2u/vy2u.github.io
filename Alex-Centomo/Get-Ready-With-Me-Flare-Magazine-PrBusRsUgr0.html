a different scenery right now not in my
bedroom like I normally am I'm actually
in the flare closet right now which is
so exciting if you guys don't know what
flare is they are one of the top fashion
magazines in Canada and I'm teaming up
with them for their get ready with me
series which is so exciting so today I'm
gonna be doing a kardashian-jenner
inspired look which I know for me it's
very different but I really want to try
something that was a bit outside my
comfort zone and kind of get a little
bit of a makeover so this is a look I'm
going for today so I'm just gonna put my
hair up right now just to get it out of
my face so I am partnering with Olay
covergirl and Pantene for this video
which is really exciting because I'm all
for their products I'm sure all of you
guys are very familiar with the
Kardashians and the Jenners because I'm
obsessed with them but they always are
known for their flawless skin so I've
been using this new product this is the
Olay Regenerist cleansing brush and I
love the way this feels on my skin this
acts as a very gentle exfoliant and
that's what I really like about it the
bristles are super soft it doesn't
irritate my skin at all which is very
important for me I find exfoliating is
very important before you do any type of
makeup especially going to do a big glam
look like this because you want to start
out with a very even smooth canvas and
that's what this really helps me with so
moisturizer is very important so I'm
just gonna apply a bit now this one has
SPF in it which is really important
because I believe that you should have
SPF at all times even if you're not
sitting in the Sun you're just going
outside you want to really help prevent
any sun damage
so I gently massage it into my skin
so now I'm going in with an eye cream
and this is the regenerist
micro-sculpting I swirl this one helps
with anti-aging and I know a lot of you
guys might be a bit young or to hear
that word you might feel like oh
anti-aging but I really believe that
you're never too young to start
anti-aging I really am a firm believer
in preventing aging signs and under the
eyes is one of the first places that
shows signs of wrinkles so I gently had
it underneath my eyes and I use my ring
fingers to kind of bring it up and
around focusing it right underneath the
eyes another reason why I chose this
item is that it brightens and that's
another kardashian-jenner trait they're
always very highlighted underneath the
eyes so I think that's perfect because
this really brightens up the under eye
area okay so now I'm going in with the
covergirl true flawless primer this
thing is honestly incredible because you
guys I'm sure a lot of you know but I
suffer from combination skin and finding
a primer for combination skin is very
very difficult because I feel like
there's no law in the market it's
usually just for oily skin or for drying
skin and it's very hard for me to find
so covergirl actually has in this line
three different options one for oily one
for combination and one for dry skin
which is great because people like me
that's a perfect combination skin
usually don't have that and what's great
about this product as well is that it
doesn't clog pores and it's suitable for
sensitive skin which again I have
I'm going in with foundational and I'm
using the trublend foundation which has
been one of my favorites for a very long
time you guys know I've shown this in my
old videos this gives a really even
flawless finish it doesn't clog pores
its oil free so that's what I love about
it and another thing what's great about
this foundation is that you know you
guys know I love running outside so
sometimes I'll get a little bit more Sun
so what's great is that it actually it's
very flexible so if you do get a bit
more Sun or a bit less it kind of
adjusts to how your skin tone is for
that day and that's what's great because
you don't have to worry about buying
another foundation this foundation works
perfectly for the kardashian-jenner look
as well because it just gives you a full
audit follow the a flawless finish which
is what of course they're known for
knowing that the Kardashians and the
Jenners always have a very chiseled
contour look my biggest thing for
contouring especially it's going to be
something a bit more intense and
something more glam is to use a darker
shade of foundation for the contouring
just applying it kind of how I do
contour is I suck in my cheeks like this
and then obviously there's a line that
is right there and you want to go from
that line from your ear almost all the
way to your mouth but you want to start
deeper near your ear and then blend out
towards your mouth
oh this is gonna look a little crazy at
first guys but don't worry once it's
blended out going awesome
so I'm gonna be highlighting under my
eyes with a trublend fixstick and I
using a shade that's a lot lighter and
more brightening than my foundation just
to make sure that it really brightens up
underneath my eyes so I'm going to be
making a triangle
underneath my eye going down from the
inner corner
and then blending it up
and then whatever is kind of leftover on
your brush you're gonna want to bring it
down your nose a little bit just to
highlight the center of nose this adds
more dimension and structure to your
face to give it that chiseled look so
I'm just going to be setting with powder
to make sure that the foundation and
concealer stays in place
onto brows so brows are very structured
with the Kardashians and Jenner's they
always have amazing brows are always on
point so I am using this one this is the
bombshell powder brow and liner and
what's great about this product is that
it's not as harsh as a liner because
it's not a pencil so it actually just
sticks to your hair so it makes it look
a lot thicker
so once your brows are done I like to
move on to eyeshadow and I'm using the
new true naked nudes palette which is so
awesome and the formulation of this is
amazing very pigmented but very easy to
blend I love the colors in this palette
there's also two other palettes so
there's the goldens and the roses but I
chose the nudes for this look so what
I'm gonna do is just pick a more neutral
tone that kind of matches your skin just
to go all over the lid I mean I put that
all over my lid up to the crease
this will just act as a base for the
look then I'm gonna go in with a more of
a deeper Brown new color that's Matt
Matt is very important for this because
you're gonna be going into the crease
and deepening up that section I start
from the outer corner and I work my way
in I like to build my eye shadow so I
don't start off with too much because if
you do it's harder to take off than to
just add once that is good I'm gonna go
in with the darker brown color so it's
the darkest Brown that's Matt and then
I'm gonna focus this more on the outer
corner bringing it in towards the center
of my lid I'm then gonna take the same
dark brown shade and go underneath my
eye I want to keep it close to the lash
line and I usually go almost all the way
to my inner tear-duct you're then gonna
blend away and this is really important
because you know you don't want any
harsh lines and they always have
perfectly blended makeup and this eye
shadow blend so easily I'm gonna be
going in with a shimmery color here it's
the fifth one up and it's kind of like a
shimmery taupe color and I'm actually
gonna go in with my finger and just
dhaba on the center of my eyelid
Kardashians are all about the sparkle
and the glam so you got to add in that
spark with me highlight of course
and then I'm gonna dab a little bit on
the inner corner as well as underneath
the brow to add that highlight so
speaking about highlight I'm gonna go in
now with the covergirl trublend bronzer
this actually has a lot of highlight in
it and I think it's gonna be perfect on
top of the contour right here to add
that highlight as well as a bit more
glow to your face so it's very pigmented
but it blends amazingly so I'm gonna
apply a little bit right over where I
did the contour from before bringing it
above my eyebrow look at the shimmer
it's adding I'm going into the liquid
liner this is the intensify me and
what's really cool about this liner is
that it's a paddle brush so you can
actually go from having a thick wing to
a very small wing depending on the way
that you apply it I'm going for a bit
more of a thin line and then I'm gonna
wing it out just a tad at the end
while this eyeliner is awesome I've
never actually done my eyeliner this
well now going on to a mascara this is
the lash blast volume I've actually been
using this for years this is probably
one of my favorite mascaras of all time
has a really nice wand very easy to
apply adds a lot of length which is very
good for this kind of look so not only
does it add length but it adds a lot of
volume to your lashes makes them look
real thick onto the lips which everyone
knows is like the most important thing
when it comes to the Kardashians and the
Jenners because they all have amazing
lips I'm using a lip liner in the shade
seduce and what I'm going to do is just
over line a little bit on top and on the
bottom and then fill in the lips with
the same color
and then I'm gonna be using the shade
smokey and I'm going to over line just
around the edges just to kind of give it
that lining look and then a little bit
on the outer corners of my lips
so you're gonna go into lipstick on top
of the lip liner and I'm using the
covergirl colorlicious lipstick in the
shade tempting toffee which is also a
number 255 and you're gonna apply that
all over this is a perfect nude and it's
also very moisturizing so you don't need
lip on beforehand and it stays
moisturized all day so this is the
finished makeup look as you can see have
a really nice deep contour fuller
looking lip big eyes and also of course
having the beautiful glowing skin which
is very important for the Kardashian and
Jenner look and I think it looks great
so I'm gonna get started with my hair so
now onto the hair my hair is just I
washed it last night and I just let it
air dry so it's all natural and I combed
it out so that way there's no tangles
and then I'm just going to simply it
curl my hair for this look I'm gonna
curl all in the same direction for one
side of my head and then do the same
thing for the other and I'm always gonna
curl away from my face
you don't want to make the curls too
tight because you're actually going to
be combing them out afterwards to give
more of a wave
so once you've finished curling your
hair you're gonna gently take your
fingers and run through the curls just
to get out all those initial knots so
you're not pulling on your hair a lot
when you comb it out brushing through
the waves so that they all stick
together this is the Pantene hair spray
and what's great about this is that it
doesn't feel like hairspray it does not
feel crunchy or hard or anything it
actually is alcohol-free and when you
apply it onto your hair it adds a shine
it just is very flexible it has a really
fine mist so it doesn't leave that
wetness to your hair it's actually very
drying and it's very flexible like I
said so you can kind of move your hair
around afterwards so I'm going to just
apply this and what's great is that I'm
actually one of the first people to be
able to use this which is awesome
because it is new
so this is the beauty look that I
created for the flare get ready with me
