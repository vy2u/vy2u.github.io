back each time you leave cause darling
I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream
the name
I'm insane
and I'll write your name what's up
everyone yes this is my face right now
this is crazy account believe I look
like this so if you couldn't tell from
the intro which I'm sure y'all could but
I for Halloween this year I'm going to
be Taylor Swift from the blank space
music video I thought this part the
section of the music video was awesome I
thought it was so cool because it's like
a typical makeup look but then like
really messed up because she's like
crying and like psychotic and stuff so I
thought it was so fun I don't own
anything leopard but you can wear
whatever you want like I'm just doing
this like brownish grey top that I have
can make your own another really cool
thing that I'm going to be wearing for
my costume that you can wear as well is
to have an apple and a knife with you so
I'm going to wear a fake knife that I
had that I got from a costume store like
a long time ago that's what I'm going to
be because I get so many comments saying
that I remind a lot of you guys up
Taylor Swift so I got a lot of requests
to do Taylor Swift makeup tutorials so I
thought this would be perfect so yeah if
you're interested in seeing how i
created this crazy look then just keep
on watching so i'm starting off this
look with a very very flawless finish to
my skin Taylor has really beautiful skin
so I just want to make sure that my skin
is all even and everything and then i'm
using this masterpiece seven-layer kit
that i got from shany cosmetics it's
really awesome actually has like a bunch
of different concealers in it and all I
shadows so I'm using a lighter concealer
under my eyes to really brighten them up
and then bringing it down my nose to
give a highlight there as well as any
blemishes that I have on my face then
taking a darker color I'm going to be
contouring my face Taylor has a very
deep contour normally with your makeup
and especially in this music video
because she has more of a glam look so
I'm just gently putting this all over my
temples down the sides of my nose to
kind of contour my nose as well as under
my cheekbones and then I'm just blending
it out using this sigma brush that I got
a while back and it just helps blend it
out evenly and make it look natural I
decide to use shany cosmetics for this
look especially just because the
products are really good for all around
coverage their toll free paraben free
and they're super affordable they're
also made in the USA for all of you guys
that are
from there and as you can see I'm just
bringing this down the sides of my mouth
my mouth the size of my nose to really
deepen up that contour and then also a
little bit on the crease of my eyes
because i do have hooded eyelids like
Taylor does then i'm using this set and
this set is just a bunch of chunky
pencils and i'm using a lighter color
for all over my lid just a basic
shimmery white and then blending that
out and then i'm taking a more darker
grey silver toned color and placing that
all over my lid up until the crease and
then underneath my lash line on the
bottom and really blending that out this
is going to act as a base for the rest
of the eyeshadows
then taking one of the sheets from the
seven-layer i shadow kid I'm just taking
a dark topi brown and I'm putting this
all over my lid and then as well as into
the crease and bring you up quite high
and then taking another topi brown color
and focusing this more on the outer
corner on the crease but the trick with
this is to make it very like smudgy kind
of make it look like you were crying and
your makeups all smudged and I'm also
adding a shimmery color to the lid to
make it pop because Taylor's lids were
very bright and then I'm just focusing
that on my inner corners as well as
under my brows to really highlight the
look and then filling in my brows of
course Taylor's brows are quite high so
I'm kind of trying to mimic that and
they're not that thick either they're
quite thin so I'm just doing the same
with my eyebrows and then I'm gonna be
tight lending my eyes because she of
course always has her eyes tight lined
with a lot of eyeliner and her lashes
always look super black so I'm doing
that as well as bringing it down on the
waterline just a little bitch kind of
like the outer quarter i guess or outer
half and then i'm going to be liquid
lining the top of my water is my lash
line the top of my lash line yes and i'm
just doing the classic taylor wane with
this look you don't want to be too
perfect because you're going to be
smudging it out and making a look crazy
so i'm using a mascara that isn't water
proof that will smudge when i add some
water to it then i'm going to be taking
a bronzer and just deepening up that
contour that I did earlier and just
adding some warm to my face because she
does have that in the music video as
well then adding some blush to give a
little bit of color to my cheeks
and of course we can't forget highlight
because Taylor always has a very
beautiful highlight so I'm adding this
on top of my brow as well as the top of
my cheekbone and my Cupid's bow as well
as my chin and down the center of my
nose kind of where I've highlighted
before and then I'm taking this cream
lipstick that i got from shany cosmetics
and this is just like the classic taylor
red and it's so pigmented and very very
easy to apply you do not need even a lip
liner anything for this so I apply this
all over my lips kind of over lining the
top because Taylor does have fuller lips
than I do making all the lines look even
and smooth and then I'm going back in
with a darker color again and bringing
that down underneath my waterline and
really bringing it down then i'm taking
a glass of water and i'm going to be
dripping this from my eyes if i was
crying and really smudging out look you
can make this as I guess messy as you
want Taylor did have tears running down
all the way to her chin so she did have
mascara leaking so I was trying to get
the same effect but as you can see here
the mascara was running but you know
sometimes doesn't always say but just go
crazy with it whatever you guys want
make it as messy and teary as you want
so I hope you guys enjoyed the tutorial
if you want to mess up your hair a lot
you totally can make you look insane
that's the best thing ever I think
