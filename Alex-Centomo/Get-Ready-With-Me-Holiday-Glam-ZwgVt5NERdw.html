have been getting at so many questions
lately about my makeup on Instagram as
you guys know I'm not a makeup artist
I've actually not that amazing with my
makeup but I do like to think that I'm
pretty good because so many of you guys
have been asking me about my makeup I
figured I would do it just simple get
ready with me hair and makeup for the
holiday so this look would be perfect
for like any kind of dinner you have or
if you're doing something with your
family or friends for the holiday I
think it's really pretty so it's pretty
simple and a little unique but it does
have some younger Flair to it it does
dress up a look as well as kind of bring
it down a little bit because it's pretty
simple if you guys are new to my channel
make sure to click the subscribe button
down below and then also turn on the
notifications which is a little bell so
that you guys know when I do upload my
videos and also if you enjoyed these
types of videos give it a thumbs up to
let me know so I'll do more and let's
just get into the video okay y'all this
is my face without any makeup on it I
really like to apply primer before I put
any foundation on it just makes my face
a really smooth canvas for any type of
makeup gonna put on afterwards and I
find this CC cream by it cosmetics
really good coverage I've been pretty
red for the past few months and if you
guys don't know it's because I'm doing
micro needling and that does cause my
skin to be a little bit more sensitive
so anytime I do touch it it gets red
especially in the winter this covers up
so much with just like the smallest
amount so I usually just do one and a
half pumps and then spread that out
evenly all over my face as well as my
neck and then anything I need an extra
bit of coverage or highlight I come in
with this Kevyn Aucoin
like concealer thing it's really thick
but it covers so much oh and I had a
booger in my nose so cute
so I just blend everything out with a
Beauty Blender that is damp I find
that's the best way to apply it any of
my foundation it just gets into my skin
it doesn't leave any kind of marks and
it stays there throughout the whole day
which I really like then going in with
some why don't we say going in next I'm
using it some of this contour stick
thing
a venti I know I really like gonna got
at Sephora seems to do the job okay I
don't really notice that much of a
difference between this and just using
regular bronzer but it does create a
really nice base and then obviously I
gotta set all of this so that it's not
sticky or shiny throughout the day and
it also helps keep my makeup on all a
day which is great and this is by it
cosmetics as well it's really fine too
so it doesn't look cakey on tuesy
eyebrows guys I actually got them
threaded are you proud of me now I have
a real shape to go off of and they don't
look insanely crazy if you have been
following my blog mass which high if
you're not you can subscribe by checking
out the link down below but I got them
threaded and I'm just really happy with
the way they turned out I finally know
how to do them properly and on to the
eyes this is where you can get really
crazy and really fun with your colors
I'm using this new shade by Tarte I'm
actually using this as a base by rubbing
it in and then using a blending brush to
blend that out and then I'm gonna go in
again with the exact same color but this
time tie it onto my lid so it creates
that really nice layer of glitter and
then going in with this palette from
Tarte I'm using a brown color and I know
it looks crazy and it looks like I'm
putting a lot on my lid but I always do
this for some reason and I just blend it
out like crazy and then clean it up
after it just works best for me but you
totally do you and whatever works best
for you adding a little bit of plum into
the outer corner and again with the
glitter cleaning it up and then going in
with a really thin line of liquid
eyeliner just to kind of add a bit of
volume to my lashes before I apply any
mascara I usually do a bunch of coats of
mascara to get my lashes really long and
really thick but if you guys prefer to
not do that and just put on falsies
totally go for it but I just I'm too
lazy to do that and then going in with
this other contour palette from Tarte
and I'm just adding some more powder
bronzer to the places where I put the
wrong zing stick thing from before and
then highlight to my cheeks and my
nose and then going in and going in
again I'm saying going in and then
filling in my lips so I'm using this
kind of Mavi brown color and this is
from Charlotte Tilbury and then my Kylie
lip kit in Malibu if you feel like this
color combination is a bit too extreme
for you with a dark lip and the intense
eye you can feel free to go in with a
more pinkish colored nude lip and I
think that look would be really nice as
well but I do have hooded eyes so you
don't see the effects of the eye shadow
as much now on to my hair this is third
day hair that I'm working with so it is
a little bit greasy but I actually
really prefer doing my hair when it's a
little greasy cuz it just holds better
so I'm just making sure to spray it with
heat protectant spray and then I use
this comb to brush out my hair because
this is actually amazing I always have
really knotted hair and this comb works
so well with getting my knots out right
away as you could see it's just really
easy because it's a wide toothed comb
and I also use this to split my hair
properly in the middle but again you can
do any kind of part that you like and
then once it's all brushed out I make
sure to curl my hair so I use a
straightener to actually curl my hair
and if you guys don't know it is
actually one of my most popular videos
on my channel is how to curl your hair
with a straightener just gives you a
really nice loose curl and it's super
easy I know it looks complicated and
honestly so many people find it
complicated I just find it really easy
for myself and it gives me really nice
simple loose waves but you can use a
curling iron for this as well I like
that it keeps my hair straight on top -
and it looks smooth and sleek I just
really like it and then once both sides
are done I go in with some dry shampoo
because it's pretty greasy not too bad
in my opinion and obviously I want to
add some length and volume to my hair
because this is a holiday glam get ready
with me to achieve this look I am going
to be using my Lexie hair extensions and
as you could see the match isn't a
hundred percent perfect and that's
something I wanted to talk about because
I get a lot of questions about how can I
order online and make sure they match
Luxy actually sends you a little sample
piece that you can try out with your
hair
it doesn't match you can always exchange
but I find that when it's all blended
together it looks so good like you could
see here it does not match my roots but
when it's all together it looks amazing
and it looks really blended it adds so
much length and volume and shine to your
hair I just think it looks perfect and I
am partnering with Lexi for this video
so thank you so much Lexi I love working
with them they are seriously being
nicest people I am not even exaggerating
I feel always so good about myself every
time I talk to them now on to this
hairstyle I just winged it so I started
doing a little bit of a fishtail braid
and then I decided to kind of stop at
the base of my neck and tie it off with
this really cute bow scrunchie and I
don't know why it gives me Christmas
vibes or like holiday vibes it just
looks so cute and another thing I wanted
to mention is lexi is doing a 12 days of
lexi on their Instagram full of
giveaways and stuff so if you want to

have all the information linked down
below for you guys in the description if
you're forgetting anything and this is
the finished look I actually like
Christmas tree shopping and I'm so
excited for the holidays oh my gosh I
cannot wait till it snows I just really
love this look I thought it was so cute
it's really like dressed down but you
can also dress it up and wear it with a
nice fancy dress you're going to a
holiday party
it's like bohemian but kind of put
together I just find it's such a mean
style
