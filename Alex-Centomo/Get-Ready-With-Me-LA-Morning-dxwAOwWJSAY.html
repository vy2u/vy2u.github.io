home from LA but I decided to film a
little get ready with me video when I
was there because I was just having so
much fun and I got so many questions if
you guys follow me on snapchat you and
you were one of the people that asked me
but I got a lot of questions on how I
did my hair my makeup almost every
single day I'd post selfies because when
I go away and I travel I like to
snapchat a lot so if you guys want to
follow me on snapchat you can do that
but snapchat is so much fun and I love
snapchatting everything that I'm doing
but I obviously post a lot of selfies
and I got so many questions on how I did
my makeup how I did my hair and so I
decide to just do a little quick get
ready with me video I basically did the
same thing every single day and if I
wasn't doing my hair I would just sleep
on it and then kind of just fix it up
the next morning really quickly
literally did not take long my makeup
was very very simple I will have a link
down below to the makeup that I did
because I actually filmed a video on
makeup that I do like for everyday
almost so I'll have that link down below
because I did that almost every single
day I was in LA so simple because I was
like running around I didn't want to
take a long time to do my hair and my
outfit is something that was just asked
so much about because I wore it a few
times and I was there if you guys didn't
know I was supposed to be there for like
four days and they actually extended her
trip because we were invited to the AMAs
so we have to stay longer which
obviously I'm not complaining about but
it was just why is my dog barking I feel
like every video my dogs bark and only
what I'm filming but yes if you are
curious to see how I got ready in LA
then just keep on watching that sounded
so fake keep on watching guys just do it
okay so here in LA Lauren was helping me
focus my camera there's her butt so I
woke up in the morning with my hair like
this I washed it the night before and
slept on it so it's all messy so I'm
taking my luck sees these are the ash
blonde set that I got custom colored to
put my ombre perfectly they matched
amazingly other the 24 inch and I'm
using four tracks of those just putting
them in my hair all the way up to like
my ears so that they don't show and
this is what they look like adding so
much volume I love it so much and then
for the curls I like to keep my hair
very beachy and messy like I do in all
my tutorials so a trick that I do is I
actually twist the hair before I twist
it around the barrel so as you can see
here I'm twisting it and then I twist it
around the barrel going in different
directions every single time the pieces
near my face I go away and then I switch
it up every single one so like the one
near my face I'll go away and the one
after that I go towards and then away
then towards and wait in the towards and
I also grab different sections I don't
curl every single piece because this is
like a beachy wave tutorial you don't
want every single strand to be curled if
you have a natural wave and then I'm
taking some sea salt spray that I stole
from my cousin Lauren that she had and
then I'm just running that through my
hair making it extra messy I work with
my own curls if you guys don't have
curly hair you can curl your whole head
if you want it's all up to you but I
love the way that this looks very beachy
and messy and it looks like I have
mermaid hair I love it
so much and I get so many compliments
and it actually just looks very natural
and just gives something extra to my
hair which I like a lot and then on to
my outfit the pretty palm trees so I got
so many compliments on this outfit oh my
gosh guys like literally wore it three
times this trip and so many people have
asked me about it so the top that I am
wearing is a top that I bought that is
in the size large
believe it or not so I kind of wear it
as like a tunic and it's from Free
People it looks like a denim jacket but
it's actually cotton material it's so
soft and really comfy and then I'm
wearing shorts from one teaspoon but you
can get them on like shop off revolved
you can get them at a lot of different
places and they're actually on sale
right now at shop off I'll leave a link
down below if they're still available
but I saw them on sale not too long ago
I just thought it looked perfectly when
it's like peeking through and then asked
for my shoes these are my favorite sale
in raw booties that were gifted to me
I'm so happy about them they're so
beautiful I'm
I love them so much and yeah I just
think this is a whole outfit is awesome
very beachy and la I just feel like an
LA girl when I'm wearing it so I hope
you guys enjoy that video it's short but
sweet I will have all the information
listed down below as well as the link to
my how I did my makeup when I was there
because it was the same the only thing I
did different was I changed up the shade
of my like foundation inch to inch into
my foundation and stuff because I did
get a spray tan
so I was dirt oh can you tell I don't
know
