karina and we actually we didn't film
this video together but we wanted to
just kind of sit down and let you know
that we have a surprise announcement to
tell you guys but you got to stay tuned
to the end of the video to see what that
is and no skipping forward you guys want
the video but yeah I hope you guys enjoy
so the first thing I like to do in the
morning on a lazy day is just take my
time getting out of bed I probably on
around 10 times in the morning just
because I'm always tired and I can never
sleep in I then grab my phone and I just
have this case from Free People which I
absolutely love and I just scroll
through my Instagram and my Twitter you
guys can follow me if you want I love
being on my social media and talking to
you guys it's so much fun and then I
will eventually move on to my computer
which I usually watch zoella in the
morning if she's uploaded something and
then the Shaytards
and then of course I have to finish off
with Gilmore Girls because Rory is
literally me after being in bed for what
seems like hours and hours on my
computer I decide that I eventually need
to get up and get myself ready for the
day so I kind of sit there for a second
I'm like what the heck do I do so then I
put my hair up in this really cute bun
not just kidding it's not like you I
brush my teeth and then I use this ocean
salt from lush it's the best thing for
my face I'm obsessed with it and it
smells like the ocean it's awesome I
then come in with my favorite cuddly
toner and then I use my Kate Somerville
oil-free moisturizer this stuff is
awesome and I actually filmed this video
before I left for Barbados so my skin
was extremely dry it was gross
usually on a lazy day I probably won't
wear makeup but if I actually have to
put some on to look somewhat presentable
for something that I will normally just
come in with my favorite concealer which
is just the Maybelline age rewind
concealer and then blend that all over
my face
just with my Beauty Blender and this
just gives the most natural coverage
ever and it's just very flawless and I
love it then to bring some color back to
my face I use my lady blush by Mac it's
just a cream blush and I just rub this
into my face and then blend it out with
my
Beautyblender again to make it look very
natural and kind of just like I was
outside in the snow and no matter what
I'm doing that day I definitely make
sure to do my eyebrows I have to have to
have to do that because girl you got to
make sure those eyebrows are on fleek
because I mean I Rose are just amazing
and I'm obsessed with doing my eyebrows
then coming in with mascara because if I
don't put my scare on I have no
eyelashes and it just looks really
awkward and people stare at me and I
just don't like that I absolutely love
highlighting my face it's like my new
obsession so I come in with my mac
mineralize skinfinish and soft and
gentle and just apply it literally like
all over my face to make it super
highlighted and dewy and pretty and I
love it cos lip balm in the I think it's
called mint I'm not too sure I love it
and it's super nice and this is the
finished look super simple but I love it
now to tackle this main of mine I hate
having my hair in my face and I'm just
loving this hairstyle at the moment so
it's just like a half-up half-down
simple bun it's not the one that's on
top of your head it's like behind your
head and then I pull out pieces on top
to make it look a little bit more full
and it's just very very cash and I love
it with a simple outfit and it's just my
go-to look for like a lazy day just best
if you guys are interested in any of the
products or clothing items I'm using in
