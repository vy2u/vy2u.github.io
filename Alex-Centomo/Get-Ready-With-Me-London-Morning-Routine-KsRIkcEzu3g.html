in Montreal right now because I'm
filming this intro after I was in London
but I realized I didn't actually have an
inch own an outro when I was there
because silly me I forgot to film once
obviously I have a lot of requests from
you guys like on Instagram and stuff
tumblr and email to film a lot more of
my like tribal look books or travel get
ready with me videos and I was in London
just recently and I thought it would be
perfect timing to do like a morning
routine in London but like holiday style
because something that I would wear for
the holidays I did a mushaf when I was
there so I figured why not film one of
those videos for you guys except this
one's actually pretty detailed get ready
with me so if you're curious to see how
I got ready in the morning in London
then just keep on watching
so starting off with my makeup I've been
mixing up two foundations to kind of
give me like the best coverage possible
and the best shade because I don't have
one that matches my skin properly so I
usually run this all over my face as
well as down my neck and a little bit
over my ears and then I take this
concealer by NARS this is my favorite
concealer at the moment I really like
the coverage it gives and I don't know
it just doesn't look very cakey on my
face and I've been told that a lot in
person so I just take the same
foundation brush and mix it all in and
then kind of go over it with my fingers
to make sure that it's all set properly
into my skin and doesn't have any brush
marks because there's nothing worse than
having brush marks am I right guys then
going in with my setting spray this is
from Urban Decay and I do this after my
foundation and concealer to make it
stick all day long and then using this
powder to set mainly the concealer but
like the places that I get very oily
which is basically like almost
everywhere
and then taking my bronzer to kind of
contour slash warm up my face because
since I still had a little bit of a
spray tan left over from LA I need to
kind of match the rest of my body
because my face literally and if it
matches my body it's such a struggle oh
and there's vert in the background just
chillin and hanging out while I do my
makeup in London then going in with some
blush this is my Mac I forgot the shade
name I think it's called prism but I'll
leave it down in the description and
I'll have everything listed down in the
description for you guys but yeah I just
really like the subtle warmth it gives
to my face and it has a really nice
contour then going in with the brows
which is a constant struggle for me if
you know me at all you know my brows are
actually horrible at the moment and I
don't know what to do and every time I
get them done properly they're not done
properly like the person over plucks and
doesn't do it right I don't know
please leave your suggestions down below
for me and then kind of brushing them
out and giving them a little bit more
volume because they are quite
non-existent at the moment but it's okay
it's a work in progress then going in
with this shade for all over the lid
it's kind of used as a base but I also
like the color of it a lot and it stays
all day long does not get Creasy it's
actually really old too and then I come
in with a brown shade and go into my
crease to kind of give my eyes a little
bit more definition and blend out to the
crease of the other thing I was using
and then I go kind of under my eye and
blend it all out so it looks seamless
and then going in with some highlight I
put this just in the center of my eyes
to give it a bit more of a pop and then
in the inner corners to really brighten
up my eyes I like the way this looks as
well as under the brows and anywhere
else that you need some highlight on
your face which is where you know the
light reflects it makes your cheekbones
look high and everything like that so I
know I really like this stuff then I'm
tight lining my eyes and going to apply
some liquid liner that is a lie I'm
using the actual crayon okay that's new
I guess I decided to do that today oh
yeah and then I smudged it out okay and
now I remember I wanted to do something
quite different and then it just looked
like a big smudge but it's okay because
it kind of looked good in the end
I swear then using some mascara I
actually used two so this one is just
more for lengthening because it makes my
lashes super long which you know it's
kind of a struggle and then I use this
one to add length and volume so it makes
them look really thick and from the side
it looks so nice I get so many
compliments when I do this so I really
like it then I am lining my lips with
the only lip liner I had at the moment
which is by Charlotte Tilbury and it was
just like a nude color but I didn't have
any Reds and I really want to go for a
red lip but I knew that if I didn't use
liner it would kind of look like not
straight I don't that makes any sense
but yeah so I'm using diva by Mac love
this color so much every time I wear it
so many people ask me like where I got
it and like what shade it is and stuff
so yeah it's diva by Mac it's looking
very bright on camera it's a more like a
dark maroon color in person but I just
thought it was perfect for this time of
year really really nice and adds
something a little bit more like holiday
festive so yeah then on to hair adding
some extensions because I really want to
do like a really big thick fishtail
braid I really like the way that luxy
hair looks just because of how thick it
is especially the ends and that's like
my issues I always have really thin ends
which is kind of annoying and gross but
I'm using one to clip weft and then two
three clips and one for clip and that's
all I'm using then I just gather all the
hair on one side
and I begin to fishtail it but I
actually use small sections on each side
just because I think the braid looks
more intricate when you use smaller
sections rather than if you just use
really big sections each time I mean
obviously you want the section on the
outside to be smaller than the like main
section but I use like really small
pieces and I don't know I find this just
gives such a different look to the braid
and I get so many questions every time I
wear this out just because people are
always like oh my god I like how did you
make your braid look like that and even
though it's just a natural fishtail it
looks so much more intricate I guess
that's the only word I know how to say
but yeah I just want to show you how
thick the ends are I love it so then I
just secure it with a clear elastic and
I begin to pull it out so pulling it out
is optional obviously you don't have to
if you don't want to some people really
like the tight fishtail braid but I
really like the big bohemian braids
especially not especially but like
literally for every time of the year I
really like them so I start off slowly
then I really start to pull it out and
then I just take out sections by my face
to frame it and I don't know I love the
way braids look especially at the
holiday season it's just so nice and
look at the extensions make them so
thick I love it so much
