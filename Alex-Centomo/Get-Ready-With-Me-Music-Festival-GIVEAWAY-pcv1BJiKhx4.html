channel I am so excited for this video
today because not only is it it get
ready with me video which by the way or
one of my favorite videos to film and
watch but it's also a giveaway video so
stay tuned till the end to find out what
the giveaway is please don't skip
forward please watch the whole thing
and before I ramble too much let's just
get into the video starting off with the
foundation I'm currently using two
different kinds of foundation at the
moment just because I'm trying to match
my skin color which actually didn't
really end up working out that well just
because my skin is kind of all over the
place right now let's color since I came
back from Turks and Caicos and my tan is
kind of fading but it worked out well
for the video so just whatever
foundation you guys want to use is fine
there are no requirements for this just
something that gives your skin a really
flawless finish and then I'm going in
with my favorite concealer which is the
NARS creamy concealer but I have heard a
lot about the Naked concealer by Urban
Decay that I definitely want to try out
so I'm just applying this under my eyes
the bridge of my nose my Cupid's bow my
chin my forehead and just underneath my
cheekbones just to give that highlighted
look I usually blend it in with a makeup
brush but then under my eyes I like to
use my ring finger just because it's not
as harsh
then I'm going to set my makeup with the
professional powder by benefit and then
going in with some bronzer this is my
all-time favorite bronzer just because
it's matte and it gives a really really
nice detailed contour look it's not
shimmery or anything but it's really
good for kind of you know shading you
can use even as an eyeshadow it's great
and I kind of just put it everywhere
that I want to contour and sometimes
I'll take like a big Brush and I'll just
lightly go over my entire face so that I
can kind of warm it up since I'm a
little bit paler my face in the rest of
my body then going in with two different
shades of blush to give my cheeks a nice
little tone um my eyebrows let's just
skip over this cuz oh my gosh I really
this is the struggle like literally
every video but I need to get them
shaped I have an appointment so don't
worry guys they will be fixed very soon
but I work with what I have and I just I
just whatever
I'm just not blessed with nice eyebrows
I'm just not one of those people but I I
try my best so just do your eyebrows
whatever you want to do them and then I
like to set them with the benefit gimme
brow because it does add a little bit
more volume and then going in with this
new eyeshadow kit that I got from Estee
Lauder it's the kendall Jenner
collection one and I use just a few
shades I use more like a bronzy shimmery
shade for all of the lid and then going
in with a copper shimmery color for the
outside and then mixing that in with a
darker Brown to really deepen up the
look and kind of bring that into the
crease in the outer V and I kind of just
do a little bit at a time I don't use a
lot of product because I don't want it
to be overpowering and I just want to
make sure I really focus on that outer V
and then bring that into the crease and
got to make sure to blend it all out
because you don't want it to look crazy
but to really deepen it up if I didn't
have all those stray hairs right there I
bring it onto my brow bone as well as
underneath my eyes and then I blend it
all out to make it look really flawless
and then I take a light shade it can be
anything I'm just using one from the
palette oh my gosh I'm just tearing my
eyebrows right now and I can't and then
taking this super shimmery gold color
from that same palette it's like a
really big one I'm putting that all over
my lid to make it super spark
we then taking my eyeliner by NARS it's
just like a regular black eyeliner and
I'm tight lining my eyes and then
putting it a little bit on my upper lash
line very very small line and kind of
smudging it out and then taking a liquid
liner any liner you want to use you can
do that just for a little bit of a wing
and then taking mascara I would suggest
like false lashes if you can really want
to go crazy but those just bugged me so
much so I just really like this mascara
because it makes my eyelashes super long
and plump it's by Marc Jacobs and then
taking my Mac mineralize skinfinish in
soft and gentle and using that as a
highlight for my Cupid's bow my
cheekbones the bridge of my nose for the
lips I'm going in with my all-time
favorite lip liner by Charlotte Tilbury
I forget the name of this one I'll have
it linked down below but I just really
like over lining my lips a tiny bit on
top and on the bottom just to give them
a more fuller look I find this really
flattering especially with a nude
lipstick and what I do is I kind of
outline my lips and then fill them in
and then I take any lipstick you want
that kind of obviously goes with the lip
liner and this is the one from the
Kendall collection I love it so much
it's very flawless very subtle you can
wear it for literally anything but I
think this is how I'm gonna rock my
makeup for Coachella maybe I'll add some
like jewels on my face I'm not sure yet
as for the hair I am doing a fishtail
crown around the side of my face so
basically you're just going to want a
Dutch fishtail I actually have a
tutorial that I made for luxy hair when
I was in London that I did this exact
look so basically when you want to do a
fishtail braid you just take a small
piece and you add it to the other side
so you take like two sides you take a
small piece you add to the other side
but when you want to do a Dutch fishtail
you kind of make it like a French braid
or a Dutch braid which is in a fishtail
version and you want to pull it out it
actually really helps if you put in some
kind of like texturizing spray
beforehand so you can really like get it
thick and looking nice and then you want
to pin it behind your head you can add
extensions you can braid the rest of
your hair you just want to look very
boho at least for this kind of look I
love the way it looks I'm definitely
adding extensions when I actually go to
Coachella but I need to get them died
because I'm dyeing my hair very soon
as for the outfit I am wearing
everything from Windsor this romper is
so frickin comfortable and I love it so
much it's perfect because during the day
it's very lightweight but at night it
gets kind of cold so the long sleeves
are really helpful for that and then I'm
also wearing Windsor shoes and I'm just
standing in my living room with my couch
they also have the same exact ones in a
non heel version which is really
comfortable as well so if you guys
enjoyed this little video I filmed one
of these last year and you guys seem to
really like it so I'll leave the link
down below I want to do something a
little bit more simple for Coachella
this year last year I kind of went all
out I mean this is more for like any
kind of music festival you don't have to
go crazy and there's no like requirement
for what you need to wear to a music
festival this is just what I would
normally or typically wear and now on to
the giveaway which I'm so excited about
so all the rules and everything will be
listed down below but basically I'm
giving away two tickets to Coachella
this year I'm so so so stoked about this
because I went to Coachella last year

much fun and I'm going again this year
but I really wanted to send two of you
guys so like one of you will win two
tickets so you can bring a friend or
your boyfriend or your sister brother
whatever I wanted to do this giveaway
enough in advance so that you can plan
everything look at the lineup figure
