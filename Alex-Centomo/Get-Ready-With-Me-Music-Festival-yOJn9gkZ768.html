sky reach the margarita sighs listen to
the male
are you with me
are you sup guys
what's up everyone so I have been
getting so many requests to do a
Coachella or music festival kind of get
ready with me video and if you follow me
on Instagram you know that I was
recently in LA because I did a shoot
with Windsor store kind of like a
Coachella Music Festival shoe and I will
be attending Coachella this year I'm so
excited it's my first time I'm going
with Karina and tests and it's just
gonna be like the best thing ever really
excited so I'm not too sure what I'm
going to be wearing or how I'm gonna be
doing my makeup and hair so I kind of
just like did what I think would be fun
um obviously you don't have to do this
exact look to go to a music festival but
I thought like it was kind of cool and I
liked it so without further ado let's
just get into the video you guys know I
love me some pura vida' bracelets and if
you didn't know pure Veda actually means
pure life in Spanish and it has honestly
become more of a movement and lifestyle
beyond any friendship bracelet I love it
and it just represents the simple things
in life
each bracelet is made in Costa Rica and
coming across someone who has the exact
same bracelet as you is really rare
because they're all very very unique and
if you didn't know every bracelet
purchased helps provide full-time jobs
for local artisans in Costa Rica which i
think is amazing plus since I love you
all I have a discount code for you guys
so all you have to do is click the link
below and use the code pier of YouTube
for 50% off all of your orders I am
starting off with my face already done
with foundation and of course I just did
my eyebrows I just want to get it all
out of the way for you guys and then
starting off with some eye primer
because if you're gonna be in a music
festival your eye shadow might tend to
crease if you're sweating and if it's
hot like at Coachella where I'm gonna be
it's gonna be really hot so make sure
you make your eyes prepped for your eye
shadow I'm using the color wood winked
by Mac I just find this is the perfect
mix between bronze and gold and I think
it looks really nice against my green
eyes I love this for any kind of music
festival look it just makes your eyes
super dark and sparkly and I love it I'm
just applying this color all throughout
my crease and my lid and then dragging
it underneath my eye just to deepen up
the look a little bit more
then grabbing the color suspect from The
Naked 2 palette I am just applying this
into the outer corner of my lid and
dragging it throughout the crease I find
this is a very subtle smokey eye look
and I love the combination between the
two eyeshadows together it's really
really flattering
this might also seem a little bit weird
but I actually dragged the color onto
the bridge of my nose because I find it
creates a really nice shadow there and
deepens up my eye look even more now I'm
grabbing the color pistol from the same
palette and just applying this very
gently to the outer corner of my eye and
making that leve thing I don't really
know how to explain this and then I just
blend it out and it looks amazing and
I'm obsessed with it it's really really
nice especially on smaller eyes it I
don't know I don't know what it is it
just looks really really nice
I forgot to film it but I did blend this
out I promise you then coming in with
booty-call I'm going to be applying this
underneath my brows and in the inner
corners and it just helps to brighten up
the look and make everything blend
together nice and evenly
so awkward filming this but I just tight
line my eyes with my two-faced eyeliner
I look crazy
grabbing my favorite Kat Von D tattoo
liquid eyeliner I'm just going to
attempt to do a winged eyeliner look and
this actually turned out really nicely
I'm very proud of myself for doing this
because they actually matched for once
okay hey need to stop giggling on to
mascara my favorite mascara at the
moment is the roller lash by benefit it
makes your lashes super long
and to make my lashes look extra big I'm
gonna be using my Too Faced better than
sex mascara on top and it looks amazing
going in with benefits hoola bronzer I'm
going to start contouring my face and
just adding an overall glow and bronze
look to my face just to kind of match
the rest of my body because my face
tends to be a lot paler than the rest of
my body and I'm just doing like the 3 e
on the sides of my face and blending it
down my neck
grabbing max prism blush I'm actually
going to be using this as a more of a
contour rather than a blush for my
apples of my cheeks wow I cannot explain
this properly but I just really want to
deepen up and accentuate my cheekbones
to kind of give me a more Pocahontas
look
for the apples of my cheeks I'm going to
be using nurse's luster blush and it's a
very nice shimmery coral pink color and
it just brings out to my tan I love it
so much gotta add the shine to your face
in the right places of course so I'm
taking my Mac mineralize skinfinish and
soft and gentle of course and just
applying it to the high points of my
face to add a little bit of shine
going in with my favorite lipstick at
the moment it's Bobby Brown's tawny pink
which is actually being discontinued I
heard and I'm really upset about it if
you guys heard otherwise please let me
know because I really don't want it to
be I love it so much it's like the Kylie
Jenner lip look I love it
I'm also adding highlight to my Cupid's
bow and my lower lip just in the center
to make my lips look fuller
now this part is optional but I wanted
to make this look more of a festival
looking look and I see this a lot on
Tumblr and Pinterest so I'm just taking
my white eyeliner and just drawing some
dots above my eyebrows and then a little
design on my cheek and I think it looks
really cool I don't know I thought it
was really neat
here is the finished makeup look ooh
trendy cool
on to the hair I decided just to do a
middle part because I haven't done that
in a while and then I figured I would do
some something crazy you know something
like very Music Festival Pocahontas
hippie style so of course I got to grab
my extensions these are my new foxy
locks ombre extensions oh my gosh guys
I'm obsessed with them and they match my
hair perfectly I'm super excited so I'm
just adding these in and then I'll show
you guys what I'm about to do
once they were all clipped in my hair I
decided to do a very similar hairstyle
to what I did in my Valentines Day get
ready with me video so you start off
with just braiding your hair like you
normally would going underneath the
middle strand and when you get a few
ways down you're gonna split the middle
piece and - and start fishtailing and
rotate back and forth between the
regular braid and the fishtail so you'll
see here I'm starting to fishtail going
from the inside to the out and if you
want a more detailed video check out my
Valentine's Day video because I really
go into detail on how to do it there
once you have your braids secured you're
just gonna pull it out and make it look
really thick you guys can leave it tight
if you want but I just like to have my
braids really pulled out so that's what
I'm doing right now
we're then gonna do it the exact same
thing to the other side and you have
this really cool bohemian
hairstyle I think it looks super nice
and I just pulled out some strands in
the front and onto my outfit I am loving
this two-piece set by Windsor the top
and skirt are both from Windsor of
course the jewelry is pura-vida the
shoes are from Windsor as well because
they are from the shoot that I did when
I was there in LA and I love it it just
screams festival for me the necklace is
from nomadic store and the body chain is
from Nasty Gal so I hope you guys
enjoyed this video if you are interested

in the comments down below because I
feel like that'd be really fun I'm still
not 100% sure when I'm wearing I did
pick out a few outfits I like what I'm
wearing right now I'm not sure I feel
like I'm gonna decide like literally
