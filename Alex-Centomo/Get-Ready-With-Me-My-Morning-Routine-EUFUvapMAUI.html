on my phone as soon as I wake up I kind
of like to catch up on my emails check
my Instagram and my Twitter and all that
kind of stuff
if you want to follow me on Instagram it
is at Alex Chang Como or Center mo
however you want to say it and on my
Twitter it's just at miss Alexandra c1 I
love talking to you guys so definitely
follow me there to see what's up then of
course and gotta rub my eyes and grab
stitch because he's my favorite thing in
the world and then I throw him also two
thumbs up for this really attractive
yawn right now oh boy
I'm usually kind of disoriented when I
first wake up so I just stay around puts
a little bit not really knowing what to
do and then I also don't really make my
bed so comment down below if you don't
make your bed as soon as you wake up
because I definitely don't then I just
throw in my slippers and head on over to
the bathroom I also walk really fast as
you can see you guys see look super
speed it's awesome okay I'm honestly the
biggest loser the first thing I do when
I get to the bathroom is wash my hands
because I just find this super important
and then I brush my teeth
and I also wet my toothbrush before I
put the toothpaste on so comment down
below if you do that because I do not
trust people who don't want their
toothbrush oh my gosh what are you doing
for real though first aid beauty face
cleanser I like to wash my face with
this every morning just because I find
it really refreshes my face and keeps my
face moisturized all day long which is
really important with the fall months
because my skin gets really dry and then
this Aveeno moisturizer is perfect
because not only does it moisturize my
face and keeps it moisturized all day
but it has SPF 15 in it which is really
important when I'm gonna be outside and
I also just like to rub this down my
neck
I've been loving the spy cream by
origins it's called the ginseng and it
just really refreshes your under-eyes I
just really like this smell and it just
what makes them look really awake and I
like it a lot and then I go in with my
little dents and my ugly button and
let's just take a moment to appreciate
that on to breakfast which is my
favorite meal of the day I just like to
take some juice and then some
gluten-free bread today I was having
some peanut butter and jam pretty boring
pretty simple but this is one of my
all-time favorite breakfasts to eat then
thrown in banana and I'm all set and
this is just the flaxseed gluten free
bread I like to keep my makeup pretty
simple on an everyday basis so I'm just
going in with my Porefessional primer I
just really like this because it gets
rid of those ugly pores that I got going
on and then I go in with my age rewind
under-eye concealer from Maybelline I
like this because on days when I have to
wake up early I just find it gets rid of
any dark circles and makes you look way
more awake moving on to my favorite
concealer which is my NARS creamy
concealer and yes I did have to use a
darker shade because I did self 10 so I
needed to match the rest of my body and
then going in with my tart powder I'm
not too sure what this is called but I
just freaking love this stuff especially
with the brush that comes with it I just
find it gives amazing coverage it's not
too full coverage it's more of a like a
light coverage but it just looks very
natural again I had to use a darker
shade because my body was much more
tanned than my face this stuff is also
great for keeping your skin matte
looking all day which is something that
I really like when it comes to
foundation and it's just very light and
natural then moving on to my eyebrows my
Anastasia brow is is my absolute
favorite thing right now I cannot leave
the house without doing my eyebrows I'm
just obsessed with it I just really like
it the eyebrows frame the face and are
very important to a everyday look I find
if you were to do anything to your face
it would be eyebrows and then going in
with my Tarte mascara called lights
cameras splashes it's the waterproof
mascara and it's very natural-looking
which I do like on an everyday basis
time to deal with this crazy hair I like
to keep my hair natural on an everyday
basis I rarely use heat so today I
decided to just braid it because I don't
know I was just feeling in the mood to
braid plus I really like the way my hair
turns out after a day of it being in a
braid it's like wavy and stuff so it's
super pretty and then I just pull a few
pieces out to kind of frame my face and
make it look a bit more messy and
windblown I just really like that look
onto the outfit today I decided to wear
my 1tsp jeans my Free People sweater a
Topshop hat and my shoes from Dolce Vita
very black and white very simple but
this is literally what I wear on an
everyday basis I hope you guys enjoyed
this video don't forget to give it a big
thumbs up if you did and leave a comment
below if you want to see my nighttime
routine and what I do before I go to bed
I hope you guys are all having a
wonderful day and I'll see you all in my
next video bye everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
