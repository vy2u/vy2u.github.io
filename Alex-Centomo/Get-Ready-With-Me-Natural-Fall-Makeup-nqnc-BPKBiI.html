so many questions on the Instagram
account from you guys asking me how I
did this makeup when I posted this
picture and it was actually so simple
and I almost didn't want to make a
tutorial because I was just like it was
pretty simple but I feel like a lot of
you guys don't know what this is I did
this thing called strobing I don't know
if you guys have heard of it before but
it's pretty trendy actually and it's
just so simple to do takes like two
seconds to your makeup and you don't
have to worry about contouring and you
have like a natural contour without
contouring it's crazy it's all about
highlighting and just enhancing your
natural features and so I decided to
kind of film this how-to video just to
show you like a very simple fall makeup
tutorial that it's like very natural and
isn't too much so you could totally wear
this to school if you guys are allowed
to wear makeup and it looks very very
natural and simple and also before I get
into the tutorial I just want to say
that I made a video for Sephora calm how
crazy is that so if you guys are
interested in seeing that video that I
did for origins on support comm I'll
have the link listed down below you guys
should go check it out and let me know
what you think in the comments because
it was so crazy that I'm on supports
website like without further ado let's
get into the tutorial so starting off
with the foundation I'm using the
L'Oreal True Match Lumi foundation and
as you can see here the color actually
matches my arm and not my face because I
did have self tan on so my face is a lot
lighter than the rest of my body that's
why I'm using a darker shade clearly it
looks a little crazy at first but once
it's all blended it looks natural and
beautiful and I really like the glow
that this foundation gives me
then going in with my True Match Lumi
liquid glow illuminator this stuff is
awesome because you can actually put it
as like a primer all over your face or
blend it in with our your foundation or
like I'm doing putting it over my
foundation but in the places that I want
to highlight afterwards so it's kind of
being used as a primer for my highlight
and I'm just applying it to all the
places that I would normally highlight
then using the true match foundation
stick I'm gonna be going over that once
it's blended and all the same areas and
then blending that out with either a
brush or your finger I suggest using
your finger for under your eyes gently
just because it looks I guess more
natural that way and also your finger
does heat up the product and make it
blend a lot better and it going in with
my True Match Lumi powder this stuff is
awesome because it's really not that
extreme it's not to no noticeable in the
light it just reflects perfectly which I
really like so it's not like extreme
I then I'm going to be filling my lips
as you can see here just subtly
outlining them over lining them a little
bit and then going into this lipstick in
the shade
I believe or mob however you pronounce
that and it looks a lot lighter on
camera but in person it's a lot darker
like in the picture and then I'm just
setting my makeup completely with the
infallible setting spray and this is the
finished look it's super duly pretty
very highlighted and look I have a
natural contour without contouring I
love this the strobing effect is amazing
so I loved it so much so I hope you guys
enjoyed this tutorial
simple and sweet I rarely do makeup
tutorials but I love watching them and I
love doing them so if you guys want to
