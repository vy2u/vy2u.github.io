Year's Eve get ready with me video today
I don't think I've ever done in New
Year's video have I I'm not sure I think
I did a holiday video last year but
anyways I've been getting a lot of
requests to do like a makeup tutorial
and I thought that yours would be a good
time because everyone likes to do their
makeup and get dressed up for New Year's
if you're actually doing something but
even when I'm at home I still like to
kind of get filled up it's just
something I've always done
I never go over the top with my makeup
maybe a few years ago when I used to
like go out to like a crazy party or
something I used to do like the sparkles
in my eyes and everything but recently
I've just been loving something very
simple with like a deep contour very
like highlighted on my cheekbones but
nothing too crazy in my eyes or my lips
so something very very simple you can
actually wear this to like any kind of
dinner party obviously I dolled it up
with the dress this dress is by free
people from a few years back so it's
very old but I'm sure there are so many
dresses like this during this time of
year forever21 has like a million right
now so yeah this is just like an
open-back one that's like tight short
sleeves and like pretty short so I wore
it out clubbing obviously back in the
day why don't you still go out so I used
all drugstore makeup for this look
because I know a lot of you guys like
when I do affordable makeup as well so
everything is L'Oreal Paris love their
lines so everything is super super
affordable and really really cute just
exactly what I like when it comes to
makeup and I like having my hair back
pretty select Bernier's because it just
shows off the contour and that's just
what I've been loving right now so if
you're interested in seeing how I did
this makeup look then just keep on
watching so starting off with the face I
have a little zit which is really sad
but that's okay I'm using these two
foundations mixing the shades because my
skin color is very awkward right now and
I couldn't decide which shade was
exactly mine so I decided just to mix
them and I'm using a Beauty Blender but
you can use anything to apply your
foundation I just find that this applies
my foundation a lot more subtle and
doesn't leave any brushstrokes and it
kind of like blends into my skin I don't
know how to explain it it just goes into
my skin and stays there all day long and
I just think it gives a more flawless
finish and for kind of a night out I
think that this is perfect don't forget
to blend down your neck and onto your
ears if you're wearing your hair up
because nothing is worse than having
that foundation line it's gross
on to concealer I'm using this like
stick one I find this looks so good
underneath my eyes I use it all the time
now it really helps brighten especially
from going out which is very rare when I
do like for a dinner or something I like
to use this I don't know what the
formulation is but it makes my eyes like
especially under my eyes extremely
bright and really really flattering
I feel very like Kardashian when I wear
it I also really like the fact that it
doesn't make my face look white because
a lot of the times in pictures
especially I don't know why but my face
will turn white I think it's like the
SPF in the product but this one does not
make my face look like a ghost
which I really like about it
I then set my foundation and concealer I
will have all the products listed down
below but this step is vital for me or
else my foundation will slide off and
then I'm using this blush and I kind of
use it as a blush slash contour just
because the color is so flattering it
has a nice shimmer in it so I use it on
my cheekbones and blend it up onto my
temples and it might seem kind of like a
lot but at night when it's dark it's
just really really really nice I get a
lot of compliments when I do this onto
the brows which by the way I am growing
out and I'm not plucking so no judgments
please but this one is actually very
it's a very good dupe for the Anastasio
one I find the color matches me
perfectly and it's really nice it's more
simple I'm still like kind of learning
how to do my brows but this one is very
easy to use you could be delicate with
it and just make small little lines to
create like false hairs and then I take
this one which actually just adds a lot
of like volume to your brows because I
am lacking in that department so this
helps with that a lot then on to the
eyes I'm using this little palette that
I thought was very subtle had a few
shimmery shades and I thought would just
like complement my green eyes and I'm
just kind of applying the darker shade
into my crease to kind of create two
crease if that makes any sense
since I have smaller eyes and they are
putted I don't normally have like an
eyelid I know that sounds crazy but it's
kind of true so I actually bring the
shade into the deep creases to kind of
create that sort of like crease if you
will and then I take the dark plum color
and put that at the outer corner and
blend it all out and it looks really
nice especially on small green eyes if
you have small green eyes I would
definitely suggest this they do have
colors for all other eye shades as well
though and then I just blend out to the
eyeshadow and make it look all even and
then I'm going to start lining my eyes
so apologies in advance because this was
so hard to fill I tried like three times
and I kept going out of focus and it
just was not working out and I was just
really frustrated cuz it's really hard
to film doing eyeliner
so I just skipped ahead for you guys but
basically I just did a winged liner with
that and then I'm using this mascara
which is so cool because it has the
primer on one side and then the black on
the other side and I just picked it up
at my local pharmacy because I thought
it looked really cool like to be
completely honest I went to this place
called farmer Creek and bought it there
if you're from Canada or Quebec you know
what I'm talking about and I just think
it looked really really nice I put a
little bit on my lower lashes and then
on to the lips I got this color I
thought it looked very similar to like a
Kylie Jenner color and I'm so into her
lips right now so this stuff is great
because it has the pigmentation of a
lipstick but it feels like a lip balm
slash lip gloss and it does give off
that lip gloss look and it stays on so
long like all day I wore it I drank at 8
and it did not budge so it's really
really good color it makes your teeth
look really white and I love the way
that this feels on my lips that's like
the most important thing ever for me if
makeup feels gross on me I do not like
it so this is the finished look again
mind the brows like really do not page
any them but I really like how subtle
the eyes are I like how full the lashes
are and the contour gives a really nice
highlight and the lips of course are so
so so flattering and this is so
something I'm gonna be wearing on New
Year's I love it so I hope you guys
