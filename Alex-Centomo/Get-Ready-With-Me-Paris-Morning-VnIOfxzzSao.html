channel if you guys don't know I was
recently in Paris obviously you guys
would have known that if you follow me
on any of my social media accounts but I
was there with Daniel for a few days I
decided I want you to a morning routine
Paris style showing you products that i
used when i travel with just carry on
and like things you could do to get
ready oh my god this is knowing me so
much things you can do to get ready with
just carry-on items I get this requested
a lot because people were like oh it's
great I love your morning routines but
like what do you use what products do
you bring with you when you can only
bring carry-on because if you guys don't
know I travel a lot and usually only
bring carry-on which limits your choices
a lot especially if I fly Air Canada
because I've had a few instances where
they only let me bring one small bag
with a clear bag I can't bring multiples
so I can't bring multiple bottles of
products there's sometimes really strict
I don't know it's only happened a few
times but I always have to prepare for
that because there has been instances
where they've taken things away and that
has really sucked big time I figured I
would show you guys minimalistic kind of
also showing you hair makeup an outfit
of what I wore in Paris if you're
curious to see that then just keep on
watching wakey wakey eggs and Bakey who
remembers that song from their childhood
so like any morning I just lie in bed
and wake up this time - Daniel filming
me no but for real I'm always so out of
it when I wake up and also so incredibly
blind because I'm not wearing my glasses
so it takes me a while to try it and
focus on my phone to see the time and
then realize them not wearing my classes
so then I put them on check the time and
go back to bed no but for real guys I'm
in Paris I gotta wake up
I gotta see what's going on today
because I'm only here for a few days and
I want to see what's up
I was super happy during this trip
because first of all this view from our
hotel room was in saying it was so
beautiful also the weather we really
lucked out it was really nice it was
like high 20s Celsius and had a really
warm breeze and I would just stand here
every morning for like a good 10 15
minutes just looking at the view and
soaking everything in and just
appreciating the fact that I was in
Paris place I wanted to visit since I
was a little kid and I just feel really
happy and content in this moment
so starting off with washing my face I
use this like travel container with just
my face wash and then I brought these
this heels I don't know the names of
these products we'll put them down below
but basically I can bring them on my
carry-on on the airplane that is why I
brought them because they're small and
then I just use a face powder for my
makeup that is one less item like
foundation you know I don't I can't
bring that because it fit all my
carry-on because it's too many products
so and then filling in my eyebrows which
by the way guys were not on fleek for
this video at all so I apologize and
then I use my bronzer as my eye shadow
to kind of just keep it very
minimalistic not bring as many products
and then just use the bronzer to contour
my face
make sure it's all blended properly
then I am going to obviously add a
little bit of eyeliner and for some
reason this doesn't count as like a
liquid at least I never put it in the
bag and they never like searched my bag
so I think it's okay going in with
mascara and then using my Kylie lip kit
in Dolce K love this shade so much
highly recommend her lip kits I really
like them I've only ever used Dolce K
and Kandy K but I love both of them a
lot then moving on to my main so I
washed my hair the night before and
slept with it in a bun as you saw took
it out then decided I'm gonna do braids
so I'm grabbing my foxy locks extensions
cuz they match perfectly
love him so much they actually were
matched for my hair at Coachella so is
it a little bit more purple but as you
can see here like a silverish purple but
it still looks so good blended together
so what I decided to do today is to do
like her very bohemian braids which haha
is not different than what I normally do
when it comes to braids basically just
taking a small strand on the top of my
head with a middle part and French Dutch
braiding all the way down
then after connecting that you're gonna
pull out the braid as much as you want
excuse my pissed off looking face I
totally was happy in this moment I swear
I was just concentrating and you just
want to be careful with it top pieces
you want to pull them out too much so go
slow with this and then once you have a
desired look do the same exact thing to
the other side so just a small section
of hair braiding it pulling it out and
then you're gonna attach the two braids
in the back behind you I always bring
like small elastics with me when they
travel just because I love to do braids
so once you attach that you're actually
going to pull out the braids that are
below the elastic that you attach them
with
and then from there you're gonna grab
the rest of your hair and you're gonna
split it into three sections and just
braid all the way down like a normal
braid
I either braid going underneath the
middle piece or over so either way you
want it's fine this one I was going
underneath the middle piece and then
making sure to pull out all the pieces
to make the braid look super super thick
and blended really well and this is how
the braid looks
I am totally obsessed with it I think
it's gorgeous
I think it would even look really nice
with a fishtail and I just really like
the way this turned out seriously I just
winged it and I was like what am I gonna
do today and I loved it got so many
compliments and then on to my outfit I
decided to pair this really comfortable
t-shirt from Windsor that I got like
right before the trip with these shoes
from Nasty Gal and these are so comfy to
walk in I can walk in them for so long
and my feet don't usually hurt and then
this hat is from bay leaves hats or
Bailey hats and it's a place in LA
that's really nice I got it online and
then these glasses are alum my choker is
Jackie H my purse is just a person YSL
my belt is below the belt these jeans
are awesome they're from revolve I'm
obsessed with them they're called
girlfriend denim and I thought this
outfit just like matched Paris perfectly
at least for me and yes that was my
phone in my pocket I don't know I just
this screams perished me for some reason
I know it's not very Parisian but I just
really liked how it looked with the
architecture and everything like that I
kind of like based my outfits off the
architecture as you can see from behind
I just thought it looked so pretty and
of course done and I had to do the
hand-holding they're so annoying but I
love them
so I hope you guys enjoyed the video if
you did make sure to give it a big
thumbs up because that makes me super
happy by the way wearing Kylie lip kit
in Kandy K I just really enjoy making
routine videos they're just my favorite
videos to watch in my favorite videos to
film so I'm just gonna continue doing
them for every season and every time I
try out new products I'll show those new
products and my makeup my makeup tends
to usually be the same but sometimes
they keep it more minimalistic sometimes
I go more the top like this was a lot
more makeup that I normally wear so I
love you guys all so much you have no
idea and I will see you guys all in the
next video oh my gosh on Monday I'm
