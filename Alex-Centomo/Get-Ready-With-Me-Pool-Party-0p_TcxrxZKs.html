channel if you guys have been following
me and Anne's vlogs which I think you
should we daily vlog so if you haven't
checked that out make sure to go do it
you'll know that I've spent so many days
back-to-back at my cousin Sofia's pool
she just has like the best backyard pool
ever and for summertime it's just like
I'm always there because why not right
and so I've been getting a lot of
questions for those of you that watch
that channel about what I like where to
the pool what kind of makeup I like to
wear especially if it's like for a
specific pool party and I know a lot of
you guys have pool parties coming up
because I've been getting so many
questions on Instagram and stuff about
it no I thought like what would I wear
if I was going to a pool party which you
know not going but if I was what would I
wear I thought I would make a video all
care towards that minimalistic makeup
but also like waterproof sun protected
and all that kind of stuff I also show
you a lip options so there's like you
know two different ones if you don't
wanna go as intense and then of course
hair and an outfit and a bikini so if
you are curious to see how I would get
ready for a pool party or a beach party
he doesn't have to be strictly towards a
pool and I mean if you wanted to wear
this on any day you could as well
because it's sweat proof so that's great
just keep on watching and also if you're
new to this channel don't forget to
subscribe so starting off with my face
as you could tell does not match the
rest of my skin I make sure to always
apply a sunscreen this one is from
Sephora its SPF 50 I just really need to
make sure that my skin is prepped for
the Sun
then using a tinted moisturizer I am
just going to be applying this as you
can see it's a little bit darker than my
skin but it somewhat matches the rest of
my body I could have gone a bit darker
to be honest but I really like tinted
moisturizers because they're not heavy
it has to just act as a moisturizers so
my skin is technically not technically
it's usually very dry so this works well
especially above the sunscreen it
doesn't get cakey or anything like that
and it's lightweight feels great then
going in with some concealer this is
from NARS and I just used the tiniest
amount underneath my eyes and blend that
in to hide any bags or anything like
that moving on to the eyebrows you guys
this is obviously not mandatory all of
this is not mandatory but for me
personally because I don't really have
eyebrows if I'm going to some kind of an
event a pool party a beach party any
kind of thing no I want to have some
eyebrows so just going to be filling
those in and then using my gimme brow by
benefit to add a little bit more volume
to them and this also makes sure that
they don't like move throughout the day
then using some bronzer I'm going to be
applying this all over my face just
because the actual tinted moisturizer
didn't really match the rest of my body
so if yours does you can totally skip
the bronzer part but you know it doesn't
this just helps also it does help to get
rid of any shine so that's good
but I'm going to want to use some
highlight on like the high point to my
face so this is champagne pop by Becca
cosmetics it's literally the best thing
ever everyone raves about it so I got it
and it really is the best thing then
going in with my eyes I like to use a
like eyeshadow base like a cream as just
my all-over lid color this just make
sure it doesn't like run all day if
you're sweating and stuff and then of
course a waterproof mascara in case you
do go in the pool get wet whatever
you're sweating you won't have that like
disgusting mascara running down your
face because that used to happen to me a
lot in swimming always actually because
I thought it was cool and more makeup to
swimming then going in with some
covergirl matte lip balm slash lipstick
this is a really nice subtle shade but
if you want to go a bit darker I would
use a liquid lipstick this is just by
the Kylie lip kit and I think this is
Dolce K but you can totally wear any
other you know liquid lipstick the
reason why I like them is because they
go matte and they don't budge so that's
another thing something that like will
not budge when you go in the water this
is perfect I wear this all day and like
it seriously it does not budge
then going on to the hair I have not
watched my hair in four days when I
found this so as you can see it's super
greasy but don't worry guys I got all
the tricks to not you know wash my hair
because I'm lazy so going with some
extensions I love to use these for
especially like beach parties and pool
parties just because I feel like a
mermaid but what I love to do is braid
them in really thick braids so I just
separate my hair in two and then each
side i braid them crossing over each
other and then when I'm around like 3/4
of the way down I secure it with a clear
elastic and I pull out the pieces a ton
to make them super thick and super like
luscious and just looking real bohemian
and like mermaid esque I love these a
ton and I make sure to keep out some
pieces around my face
once they're both done what I do is add
and hat because you know greasy hair is
gross and yeah this is the finished look
I think it's so cute as for the outfit I
like to wear tank tops because it gets
really hot and then shorts as well for a
bathing suit what I really like to wear
is like obviously triangle bathing suit
because if I am going to tan my top I
like to have that tan and then the
bottom something a bit more high-waisted
if you are uncomfortable being in like
you know following with around a bunch
of people this is just my favorite thing
to wear I think it's so cute so I hope
you guys enjoyed the video if you did
make sure to give it a big thumbs up
because it makes me super happy also I
know so many of you want to know what my
updated bikini collection videos coming
up that's coming up soon I'm in Iceland
at the moment or I was in Iceland
I don't know I'm pre filming this video
so I have to wait till them back from
that to be able to film it and I also
needed like my cousin's pool to be able
to film it and I had I don't have that
much time plus I have bikinis coming the
mail so don't worry it's coming very
soon this week or the next one it's
coming I love you guys all so much
seriously you don't know how much you
guys mean to me make me so happy and I
hope they can make you guys happy I love
you and I'll see you all in my next
video bye
