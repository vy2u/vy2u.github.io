channel
I feel like I have not done a sit-down
talking video in so long and it feels
really good to be sitting back here and
talking to you guys I miss you guys so
much I asked you guys on Instagram what
videos you guys wanted to see for me
this month and I think the top one was
get ready with me for summer if you guys
don't know I do get ready with me for
like almost every single season also if
there's like any kind of events they're
just my favorite videos to film as well
as watch I also like hauls and stuff but
like get ready with me they're just fun
but I feel like I don't really switch up
what I do anymore I just feel bad I keep
throwing these at you and I'm not really
like a makeup artist I don't really do
anything crazy so I decided I'm gonna do
a real summer morning routine this is
literally what happens to me when I wake
up in the morning during the summer so I
decide to do something a little bit more
creative instead of doing the typical
get ready show my makeup show how I'm
cooking in the morning and all that kind
of stuff I decide to do kind of an epic
video before I get started I just want
to say that this video is a club with
Emilio Liana I am so excited we did a
club once before and it was so much fun
she's just like so beautiful and so nice
I really genuinely love her like she's
so down-to-earth she's so real with her
followers if you guys are coming from
her channel hi but she is like I just
really admire her honesty in her videos
also the amount of effort that's put in
every single one of her videos is like
top quality so good she's so consistent
I just like really look up to her so I'm
so excited to clap with her again and if
you guys are interested in seeing her
version of her get ready with me I'll
make sure to leave her links down below
you can click the screen I'll also have
a link and like during the end slate
that you guys can click yeah she's just
really really talented and I love
watching her morning routine especially
the fact that she was in London you guys
know I just like I'm obsessed with
London and everything there is just
perfect and beautiful and so is she and
I'm really really excited
if you guys don't fall on her on
snapchat you should because she bakes
all the time and every time I watch them
I literally like drool from the mouth
it's it looks so good and she does a lot
of like hauls and giveaways on her
snapchat so I'm just gonna like keep
promoting her you know seriously guys go
follow her go subscribe and tell her
that I sent you I'll leave all her
social links down below if you're
curious as well without further ado I'm
making this intro way longer than it
should be let's get into the video so in
the summertime I wake up honestly
whenever I want which is usually really
early in the morning because I have a
problem who's sleeping in and so
normally when I wake up I'm kind of
cranky just cuz I probably have not
slept that much I don't know it's kind
of an issue right now but getting better
at it literally look like a lion just
like my hair is always a mess complete
and utter mess then once I've kind of
figured out them I am awake I head on
over to the bathroom which typically my
sister is in and takes forever in the
bathroom taking a shower
doing whatever so I usually have to wait
for a while outside to be able to brush
my teeth so finally when I get in she
kicks me out which is the norm still
love her though
so I usually brush my teeth outside and
then I always go for my workout before I
wash my face or anything the first thing
I do in the morning is go for a run
because I just know that if I don't do
that in the morning then I probably
won't do it later on
Lola always gives me some encouragement
because she knows she's so active right
so if you want to see more of my workout
routine I'll post a link to the video
there that's just like the most recent
one I've done I get back from my workout
and I always take a shower right away
sometimes I wash my hair sometimes I
don't then I apply sunscreen and in the
summer I'm outside a lot so I always
make sure to protect myself this one is
one I've had from oh it's like actually
really old it's from Sephora I feel like
I need to upgrade because I don't even
know if this works anymore but I always
make sure to prep my face and then as
well as put on some lip balm because you
gotta protect your lips as well but this
also has SPF in
then today I actually went for breakfast
with my dad and my boyfriend so I got
some fruit with granola and a smoothie I
was just like a really really good
breakfast and then I head on over to the
beach I never wear makeup in the summer
unless I have like an event or if I'm
filming like an intro or something so
this is my real like everyday routine I
don't wear makeup don't do anything to
my hair just like head to the beach or
head to the water slides or doing
anything in the summer just to get
myself outside and out there and doing
something fun and I just love being
outdoors and especially doing things
with dad or my friends it just makes me
so happy so this is really what I do in
the summer
how do the tester start let's go
almighty Thunder California
swept up
so I hope you guys enjoyed it really
like I decide to do something a lot
different but it's just what I like to
do with my videos now I'm getting more
into like videography and trying
different things that makes sense I just
like making my videos a little different
so if you guys did enjoy it make sure to
give it a big thumbs up to let me know
and also if I like really forgot
anything in this video leave it down
below in the comments and also what do
you do that's different in the morning
because I feel like if I don't go out
and do things like go to the beach or
like go to like the water slides or a
theme park or shopping or something with
my friends then literally all I do is
just like stay inside and watch Netflix
oh that's really bad
so I forced myself to go out there don't
forget I love you guys all so much and
don't forget to subscribe if you want to
and I will see you guys oh oh my god
wait I forgot to say we're literally
almost at a million followers on
Instagram life like what what is life I
don't know my eyes just like crying
because I'm moles in a million I love
you guys so much and I'll see you guys
on the next video bye
also if you hear the shutter noise I'm
so sorry but no one was here to focus
the camera
