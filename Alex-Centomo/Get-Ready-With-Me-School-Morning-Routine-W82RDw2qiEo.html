school I'm getting it up Alex
time to get up yeah Alex get up you're
gonna miss the bus yep yep that's
actually how I used to wake up to go to
school I'm not even joking you guys my
mom would always have to yell at me but
as you guys all know I'm not in school
anymore so I don't have to worry about
that to be honest I actually wake up
early on my own now the fact that I
don't have to wake up early makes me
wake up early it's weird but let me know
in the comments how you guys tend to
wake up when I was in school social
media and that kind of stuff didn't
exist yet
we had msn thumbs up if you remember
ever since so I didn't have like
Instagram Facebook and stuff now when I
wake up I go on my phone a little bit
and so I can wake up slowly words back
in the day I literally had to get up get
ready for school and it was just not a
fun time so I'm very jealous of you guys
that have that because you know it's fun
to have it at school as well also at the
end of this video I have another
announcement for you guys to make sure
you stay tuned until the end don't skip
forward watch the video and you will see
at the end so love you guys all so much
and let's get into the video so if I was
in high school nowadays I probably would
be checking my phone first thing and not
have my mom yell at me and then I'd
probably get shocked by some kind of
news that I saw on Twitter or something
because this literally happens to me
every morning and once I'm done with
that it would be the struggle to go out
of bed because can I just say hashtag
lion's mane check out that hair
once I'm out of bed by the way kung-fu
sweatpants ever just saying I make my
way over to the bathroom because the
first thing I do when I wake up is brush
my teeth because the dentist freaked me
out with the story once about how like
all the bacteria that you swallow if you
eat before you brush your teeth I don't
really remember what it is but I just
got into the habit of doing it and now I
need to brush my teeth before I eat I
also floss but I'm not going to show
that because I mean you guys really
don't need to see me fall saying it's
not that attractive and once that is all
done I like to wash my face with my new
obsession which is the origins checks
and balances I've talked about this many
times in my channel before I'm actually
quite obsessed with origins lately
they're not sponsoring this video I
promise you I purchase everything with
my own money I'm just obsessed with all
these products this also happens to me
on a regular basis where I'm washing my
face and I smell a towel and it's old
and disgusting like do I use a serum
every single morning just to help
replenish my skin and make it feel a lot
more hydrated because I have really
dehydrated skin so this step is
important for me in my skincare routine
and then I just use a moisturizer on top
of that once it's set and I'm good to go
and it just makes my skin feel amazing
onto the maquillage I mean makeup but
basically I don't really wear makeup to
audios I conceal the areas that have
like any spots or redness underneath my
eyes that kind of stuff I just use my
finger to blend it all in and then I use
the benefit gimme brow on my brows
because they don't really exist and then
all I do is I put mascara lip balm and
bronzer so that it can match the rest of
my body because as you could tell my
face is severely pale compared to the
rest of my body
I don't get it
you
ever happen to you where you have a
closet full of clothes but you feel like
you have nothing to wear because this is
the daily struggle for me I don't get it
I just I don't know so what did I do
I decided to go shopping because I have
a problem for breakfast I usually to
have some kind of oatmeal since I'm
gluten intolerant this is what I could
have and then I add some honey from
Greece because I just love things that
are sweet it's my obsession so this is
what I picked up at the store love these
simple tops from brandy melville oh my
gosh so obsessed with it and the colors
just so cute don't mind my dancing I
just think these tops are so perfect for
school because they're casual but cute
and they have little like graphic detail
lines on it this just says California
like 1984 something random like that and
I paired it with my black denim jeans
and of course my superstar Adidas
sneakers because they're so comfy and I
can walk on them all day also if you're
unable to wear like shorts or anything
like that at school like if your uniform
doesn't allow you you can just
substitute mush the shorts for like some
jeans or something that covers more and
I love it so I hope you guys enjoyed the
video I had so much fun filming it I
love filming get ready with me videos
this was so requested so even though I'm
not in school you guys want to see what
I would do on a typical school morning
