obviously I'm not in school right now
but I was requested so much to do this
video because you absolutely love them
and I love making them for you guys so I
decided why not
plus I feel like if I was back in school
this is how I would wake up I'm really
not a morning person when I have to wake
up so you know on days that I don't have
to wake up for some reason I wake up so
early on days that I have an alarm set
it's like I could sleep all day so if
you are one of these people let me know
by commenting down below or giving this
video a thumbs up and yeah once I wake
up I you know check my phone probably
check my snapchats check my Instagram
because I'm trying to avoid getting out
of bed to go to my classes because I
just you know I dread it all so shout
out to Tim for helping me film this you
are the real trouper I love the way he
film this is awesome but yeah so I just
grabbed all my products in the morning
I've been trying out a new skincare
regime routine I don't know if you guys
are curious let me know I'll talk about
that it worked wonders then I'm off to
the bathroom but you guys are not coming
with me because that's weird haha just
kidding if you guys really want to know
detail let me know I will do a separate
video all off that right now I'm going
to get ready so first things first you
guys know the struggle with my brows how
I'm always complaining that they're not
thick and I wish they were thick so when
I came across this product I was really
eager to try it out but also a little
skeptical so this is the salon Brown
hansung serum after a few weeks I really
start to see a difference and now my
brows are way more noticeable even
without makeup on so it's a super cool
product and I'm really happy about it
and my brows just look amazing if you
guys are interested in checking it out
I'll have a link down below or you can
search east along comm slash Alex for
50% off now on to the makeup I like to
keep it quite simple to be completely
honest when I was in high school I never
wore makeup and then when I was in
college I would just use concealer
on the places that I felt like I needed
it just like I'm doing in this video so
the one by Urban Decay is really good
right now that's what I've been using
and then anything to kind of brighten
your under-eyes because you know lack of
sleep also if you're wondering oh my
voice sounds like this
I actually just woke up so I thought it
would kind of go along with the theme of
this video because obviously it's a get
ready with me and then using any kind of
palette that has a blush a highlight and
a bronzer in it is just so simple and
easy to use because you got it all in
one so I'm kind of just putting this all
over my face because like I always say
my face never matches the rest of my
body so this is what I'm using it's just
very simple and then I'm using the same
palette over at my eyelids I just use
the bronzer to kind of I guess darken
the look at a bit of a contour nothing
too intense because you know it is
school so you don't really need to go
all out with your makeup I mean you can
if you want just personally I never did
that then using some mascara and some
brow gel to set my brows in place
because they tend to just go all over
the place throughout the day and
sometimes I look in the mirror one will
be going up when we going down it just
looks like a crazy hot mess
then lipstick obviously is optional I
really like this buy buy cosmetics
because it's very subtle and especially
if you rub it in with your finger it
just looks very natural and I love this
makeup look it's so simple but very
appropriate for school on to my favorite
part which is my hair you guys I have
not done a hair tutorial and so long I
feel like so if you guys are interested
in seeing any kind of back-to-school
hair tutorial hairstyle ideas with heat
without heat let me know what are your
suggestions I want to do what you guys
want anyways back to the video so I
always use dry shampoo because um I wash
my hair like once every 5 days even
though I work out a ton and my go-to
hairstyle right now is just so simple
it's literally a high pony very messed
up with strands kind of around my face
like as messy as you can get it I don't
know that like looks or sounds so weird
but I just love the way this looks so I
don't know I'm into it right now and
it's simple right you don't need to do
anything well just put your hair and
point out that's it then I typically get
changed right after I get ready and if
you guys want more outfit ideas be sure
to check out my last video because I did
a bunch so for this outfit for example
if you can't wear shorts to school you
can just replace them with actual jeans
or any kind of long pants if you have a
uniform I'm so sorry I never went to
school the uniform so I don't know what
that's like but I'm actually very
jealous because I always wanted them
after this I would typically run
downstairs and grab some breakfast and
head out the door if you guys are
curious to see more of that let me know
also I love you guys I hope you enjoyed
the video give it a thumbs up if you did
and I will see you all in my next one
bye
it's a little brown me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
