today I decided to film a get ready with
me morning routine slash summer really
casual just you know something I would
wear every single day I get a lot of
questions on Instagram how or like what
I do in the morning to kind of get ready
to go out I'm going to shoot or what I'm
doing with friends and stuff and it's
pretty simple I just go to bed wash my
face do simple makeup and throw on an
outfit do something really casual with
my hair because I like to keep it pretty
simple in the summer especially since
it's so hot and humid where I live it's
like crazy but I feel like if I were to
like have crazy curls in my hair at this
time of year it would just like go like
this like triangle but if you're curious
to see what I do on an everyday morning
for summertime then keep on watching and
also give this video a thumbs up if you
want to see it a back to school series I
really want to do it but I want to know
how many of you guys want to see it
subscribe if you're new and let's get
into it okay hey hi good morning this is
me sleeping trying to be peaceful you
know for purposes of the video when in
actual reality I look more like this I'm
not even kidding sometimes mouth open
with drool and I don't love getting up
in the morning even though I'm an early
riser I oh that makes no sense but I'm
always cranky when I wake up in the
morning and I try not to be it's just
one of those things that I'm like oh my
gosh this is so annoying why do people
have to be awake you know so I try to
stay in bed for like 15 to 20 minutes
just waking up slowly making my way to
the bathroom because you know that's
where I do all my business and wash my
face all that stuff um - no makeup I
actually recently just did a like makeup
tutorial where you could see what I've
been doing almost every single day with
my makeup it's pretty simple I said
simple so many times in this video but
literally that is the definition of my
life like anything sensible anything
quick yes please perfect for me thank
you so much but yeah I'll have a link
listed down below if you guys are
curious to see how I do my makeup but
again
I'm not a makeup artist this is just
like what I love love with this lip coma
by the way totally stole the true test
thank you love you
asked for hair this is something that I
love to do so adding in my lucky
extensions is something that I have been
doing for actual years but this is the
new seamless set and if you guys are
subscribed to my blogging channel you
would have seen me actually on boxes but
holy crap guys this set not only is it
super lightweight but it feels
completely flat against your head and if
you guys have everyone extensions before
you know how it sometimes can like feel
like it's pulling your hair down
weighing it down it like hurts this
feels like so lightweight like I'm not
just saying that honestly I feel like I
have barely anything in my hair and it
just makes it look so full if someone
touches the back of my head they kind of
feel like I'm wearing extensions which I
love so much this is actually a new
shade as well it's called blonde valley
and it's perfect because it starts off
darker and then ends lighter I also love
how cool it is it makes my hair so thick
I get so many compliments on my hair
literally every time I leave the house
I'm upset and I cannot wait to rock this
color in the fall as well with like a
really stark lip I think that would look
so nice then finishing up with some
texture spray the brand is called you
added by Megan you're so lucky you guys
know I'm literally obsessed with her I'm
going to do a simple braid say my
extensions are already curled from the
last time I did my hair so it's going to
look really nice once the hair is
braided I love that kind of look really
messy vibe and stuff by the way if you
are curious to get a pair of extensions
for yourself not care a said I'll have a
promo code listed down below in
description for you guys to check out
and I just wanna say a huge thank you to
Lexie for sending me this and having it
custom-made I'm like the biggest fan I
love this company so much I love meeting
Alex like they are just goals in
everything in life and I'm just so happy
with how it looks and how it feels and I
just I really love it but literally took
on 1987 minutes I calculated it from
start to finish
but as you could see I'm like touching
it to show you guys that I feel nothing
outfit time keeping it cash most of it
is brandy melville like the top and the
hat the jeans are very simple from
princess Polly
wearing the classic band has a bit of a
platform I bought these off of ebay I
think and they were like the kids
