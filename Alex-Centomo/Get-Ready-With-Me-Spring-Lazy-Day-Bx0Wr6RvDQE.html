channel I am in such a happy mood again
because one it is finally spring time
outside in Montreal I am so happy sunny
it's beautiful it's bright in my room
and I'm feeling so great too
I just got back from Coachella and it
was such a fun experience I had a blast
if you guys haven't seen it already I
put up my Coachella travel diary which
will be linked down below as well as all
my vlogs from Coachella that I filmed
daily on Danny's Channel and then on my
main blogging channel into like a big
vlog but I'm so happy right now since
the weather is super nice outside I've
been getting so many requests to do a
morning routine but I kind of just did
one so I decided to do a springtime lazy
day routine because this is probably me
almost every single day not that I'm
like a lazy person but I don't do much
other than like film and edit like
that's my job basically so when I'm not
doing that I'm just lounging around
either reading or bugging Daniel or
trying to hang out with my sister or
friends but everyone is just so busy at
the moment so I figured I would just
show you what I like to do when I'm lazy
and I don't want to spend the time to do
a bunch of things but I still want to
look cute if I'm like one of them all or
something after so if you guys are
curious to see this type of video then
just keep on watching good morning on
days when I don't have much to do I
don't have a lot of filming or editing I
like to stay in bed as long as I can
typically until 8 a.m. and then when I
don't you know what to do I tend to just
brush my feet brush my feet what brush
my teeth and then I move over to skin
care so I just wash my face and I've
been using my Kiehl's face wash this is
in French you guys won't understand that
but it's awesome I've been loving the
Olay complete all day UV moisturizer
it's really important for me that my
skin is protected from the Sun
especially during the spring and summer
months I mean all year long too but
especially during these months because
I'm always outside on the go so having a
moisturizer that includes SPF makes it
easy to protect my skin sometimes I find
moisturizers with
PF are a little bit too oily and thick
but this moisturizer has vitamin C and E
and absorbs quickly into my skin leaving
my skin feeling super soft and fresh it
also smells really good I don't know I
just really like it a lot now on to my
face I have been loving this Tarte I
don't even know it's like a powder
foundation I've had it for like a
literally year and I only use it when I
have a tan because it's too dark for my
face but I love how light coverage it is
but it makes your skin look flawless
seriously so perfect it literally adds
like an extra layer of perfect skin I
don't know I just really like the way
this looks
it doesn't like make my skin look flaky
doesn't make it look too dry not cakey
at all it's just like perfect and so
simple to put on because it's literally
just a powder and it doesn't feel like
I'm wearing anything on my face which is
very important for me because I hate the
feeling of foundation so much then I
take my bronzer and I actually just use
a fluffy eyeshadow brush and put that
all over my eyelid I don't make it
perfect at all I kind of just am super
messy with it I put it all over my lid
as well as in my crease just to kind of
add dimension to my face and then I fill
in my eyebrows which normally it would
take me a long time but with this like
brush I have it's super quick and then I
use a mascara any mascara you want this
is just a waterproof one that I've been
loving lately it's super nice but it
does get caught on my eyelid which is
super super annoying so I have to always
clean that up afterwards
on toodle it's I've been loving this
covergirl Oh sugar
lip balm this stuff is amazing this is
the shade this is the color it's
flawless it's beautiful and you guys
know I'm a huge fan of products that
save time and multitask so this is the
most beautiful sheer coverage for spring
and is packed filled with moisture
because the formula has avocado butter
and vitamin C and E and they smell
really citrusy as well I love the shine
it gives I just love how simple and
natural this looks it kind of just adds
a little bit of color to your natural
lips without being too overpowering plus
it's super moisturizing and I just you
know it takes literally two seconds
which is a must when I am lazy which is
all the time to tackle my super oily
hair I have been loving this furball
Essences naked dry shampoo it smells so
good and I've mentioned before that I
try to avoid over washing my hair
everyday so this is my go-to dry shampoo
at the moment for days my hair needs a
quick pick-me-up it's made with natural
tapioca and without dyes or parabens so
it absorbs the extra oil super fast it's
also very lightweight and it smells
really good like I said so I've been
absolutely obsessed with this
it doesn't feel crunchy which is like
one thing that I really don't like when
it comes to dry shampoos it doesn't
leave your hair white and as you can see
here my hair is like literally so oily
but it just adds so much freakin volume
and texture to your hair I would even
recommend using this after you wash your
hair to add extra volume if you don't
blow-dry your hair but look at this it's
crazy my hair is like so volumous and so
I mean the only really way I can explain
it is that it looks like I belong in an
80s high school movie mixed with a
lion's mane but I love love love love
love this product
I then usually move on to read a book
this is the one I am currently kind of
rereading just getting so excited for
the game of Thrones episode oh my gosh
who watches the show
I'm obsessed and then I go and typically
bug Dan because either he's like busy
editing or watching movies or playing
video games or something and I just want
attention I'm sorry this is actual truth
I really like attention I like when he
gives me attention and I'm very very
annoying so this is something that
happens on an everyday basis with us I
just I need attention from him and then
he gets annoyed and pushes me away but
it's all fun and games guys we love each
other so I hope you guys enjoyed the
video don't forget to leave a like

happy and also if you're new to my
