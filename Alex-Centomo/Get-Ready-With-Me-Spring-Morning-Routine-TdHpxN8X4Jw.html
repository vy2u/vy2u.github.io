sup guys so this video was supposed to
be a spring you get ready with me but
basically it's summer right now like
it's summer weather still a little
chilly like it's not like full high 20s
I'm Celsius by the way but it's
definitely is nice outside I'm wearing
shorts and t-shirts and it's basically
summer but it's still technically at
springtime so this is a spring time get
ready with me I'm really excited because
I love filming these videos there's so
much fun to make and I don't know if you
guys are interested in seeing my workout
routine then I will make a separate
video for what how I workout outdoors
and stuff like that if you guys are
interested
so let's see if we can get to this video
to 7,000 likes that would be awesome if
you guys haven't go click that button
down below it would mean so much to me
and I don't know we got 6,000 last time
so let's see if we can get a new record
and before I start rambling any more
let's just get on into the video waking
up in the morning is never an easy thing
especially for me because all I want to
do is just sleep and just lie in bed all
day but I do know that I got to get up
eventually so I just you know stare at
nothing for like 5 minutes my house is
on and then I check my phone all the
social media links like Instagram
Twitter snapchat everything like that
when that's all done I decide to go or
rinse my face tea for my workout because
I don't like to workout with all like
the gunk build-up from overnight I find
it really gross so I just give a big
stretch and then head on over it to the
bathroom
ah no heroes villains want to play so
the first thing I do in the bathroom is
brush my teeth because honestly this is
a habit of mine I cannot do anything
without brushing my teeth I don't like
eating before I brush my teeth I don't
know the dentist just scared me once by
saying the amount of bacteria that you
swallow if you don't brush your teeth so
that's why I do it and my tongue of
course super-attractive Alex right then
I floss with these really cool toothpick
things that actually don't hurt my gums
and I also rinse my face but I didn't
show that my workout gear in the summer
is very simple so I like to keep it very
classic with just some simple workout
shorts that are like really old from
Abercrombie and then this sports bra
from Univ is really comfortable as well
and also really stylish and then of
course just have my hair in a ponytail
and then I use these shoes to workout in
I love to run outside and as you could
see they're full of grass stains because
I like to run in the grass they're a
little dirty but they do the trick and
they're awesome if you guys would like
to see a spring /summer
workout routine let me know in the
comments down below and I'll definitely
do one for you where I go into more
detail and everything because this is
just you know I get ready with me video
but I'd love to go into detail and show
you the exact exercises I do and
everything like that
once I am finished with my workout it is
time to get myself in the shower because
I probably stink really really bad oh
yeah and a towel
usually just randomly appears when I get
out just kidding I keep my makeup very
minimal on a spring or summer day I
don't actually use too much foundation
or anything I just like do my eyebrows
and contour a little bit and of course
use some mascara and I cannot do a
makeup tutorial without using my new
favorite lip liner which is by Makeup
Forever aqua lip and 3c literally
obsessed with this stuff it's so nice
I get so many compliments on it I will
have all the products I use listed down
in the description for you and then ask
for hair I just use my trusty sea salt
spray from lush love it if you spray it
in your hair when your hair is like 80%
dry it just gives the coolest texture
ever and I'm obsessed
Montreal is literally all over the place
with its weather right now for spring
but I filmed this on a really hot day so
that's why I was wearing this my
favorite jeans from one teaspoon this
really cool open back top that I got
from L F in New York City and then just
having my hair natural with the sea salt
spray and this really cool hat that I
got from Jack Vinick yes I was singing
and dancing to N Sync and then my choker
is nomadic store and my sunglasses are
ray-ban

up and also subscribe for more videos
