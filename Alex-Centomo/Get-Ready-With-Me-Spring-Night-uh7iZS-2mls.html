channel today I decide to sit down and
film my spring at nighttime routine I
know
routine videos are your favorites to
watch there's some of my favorites as
well so I figured I did a morning
routine not long ago so now I'm going to
show you what products like to use at
night when I take off my makeup and
everything like that if you guys are
curious to see how I get ready at night
then just keep on watching first thing I
do in the shower is take off my makeup
but I quickly want to talk about this
mascara cause it is amazing it's the
cover girls super sizer mascara it adds
so much volume and lace to my lashes
it's great I've talked about it so many
times in my previous videos I then go in
with my makeup remover this one is from
Boscia
both yeah I honestly don't know how to
pronounce it but I find this oil just
takes off my makeup so well plus this
mascara is actually super easy to take
off
it does not rip out your lashes or
anything like that and I really like it
cuz it lasts all day long and look it
comes off super easily I usually have my
hair taken out before but I forgot this
has never happened to you guys we're
like you turn on your shower and it's so
cold well yeah that happens to me on a
regular basis then I just rinse off the
oil as well as the makeup and then I
just rinse my hair and make sure it gets
all wet before I put any product in it I
didn't realize they didn't rinse my face
well enough so I still had a little bit
of makeup on so I have been loving
purple shampoos because I did dye my
hair a bit lighter so purple shampoos
and purple toners are the greatest
invention ever when you have a blonde
hair because it just gets rid of all of
that yellow who are my conditioner I
have been loving the Pantene pro-v 3
minute miracle deep conditioner well
that is a mouthful but after a long day
no one really wants to spend too much
time with their hair maintenance well at
least I don't
and with this conditioner all you need
is three minutes for amazing results
coming out of winter my hair is still
pretty dry so I was looking for
something that would be super hydrating
and bring it back to life and this is my
new Savior my hair is so much smoother
and softer I honestly can't believe it
it feels so good and then I always wash
my face and my body last I actually
learnt this through like Kendall's app
she said that if you wash your face and
your body lasts you will break out less
so I just wash my face and wash my body
after I wash my hair and yeah I'm not
going to show you watching my body
and yeah like not that kind of video
guys then when I get out of the shower I
use a toner and this toner is from Kota
Lee it's my favorite toner it smells
amazing a toner is very important for me
and my nighttime routine and I don't
ever skip the steps sleep is the time
your skin that recovers repairs and you
talk supplies so on top of getting
enough sleep what you all should I make
sure my scene is prepped at the right
overnight mass so much easier than
peel-off masks you leave this mask on
overnight and wake up with bright and
hydrated skin it's sort of a gel like
formula so it feels really nice going on
and it's supposed to even your skin tone
over time I've been using this for the
past few weeks and I've really noticed a
difference in my skin now back to my
hair I've been using this product I
don't remember where it's from but I
basically just spray it in it has it's
kind of like a detangle flyer and I
either use my fingers or a wide toothed
comb for this part but yeah look how
much hair comes out how disgusting is
that and then I just used a simple argan
oil again I don't really know where this
is from it was sent to me like last year
it's lasted me so long and I just gently
massage this not massages I run this
with my fingers through the ends of my
hair and then I move on to moisturizing
my body and oh my gosh guys if you can
notice my cuts and bruises I actually
got attacked by my drone and look what
has happened to my legs like seriously
if you're curious to see this video I'll
have it linked it was on me and Dan's
blogging channel and yeah it was great
then I just head off to bed usually with
a big glass of water and yeah I enjoy my
night thanks Dan for filming crack my
back do you love me oh so much do you
like my bruises I do guys Daniel abused
me we have evidence of it being a drone
and not me if we go to court it was not
me
what kind ever was because I was flying
again so I hope you guys enjoyed this
video if you did make sure to give it a
big thumbs up to let me know and also
