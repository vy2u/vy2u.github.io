expecting it to be beautiful outside
because it's summer right and you have
all these plans does it ever happen to
you guys well where I'm from right now
it's raining like every single day and I
was actually supposed to film my summer
get ready with me routine morning
routine kind of thing and then it
actually is what happened I like woke up
all excited I opened my blinds and saw a
thunderstorm and I was like yay thank
you mother nature thank you Montreal for
always raining thank you thank you so I
thought okay well what do I do on a on a
rainy day when I'm actually supposed to
be doing fun things because I get very
bored you know quite easily so these are
things that I like to do little pamper
routines little I don't know stuff I do
when I'm not really going to be leaving
the house and I'm just gonna be chilling
inside but I still want to obviously get
ready lazy day routine if you guys are
interested in seeing what I do let's get
into it just because it's lazy day
doesn't mean I don't wash my face I've
been loving this it's actually my
sisters and I just steal it from her and
then the next step that I do is this new
face mask I'm obsessed with it it's by
origins it's called the original skin
retexturizing mask with rose clay and
I'm actually obsessed with this because
it's actually a two in one product it
absorbs excess oil and pore clogging
dirt then refined skin texture so I
usually just apply just a little amount
like this a thin layer all over my clean
skin I usually wait around 10 minutes
and then when it hardens natural wax
jojoba beads exfoliate skins texture and
it feels so good another reason why I
love this mask is because it also helps
to restore my skin's clarity and
luminosity to reveal a glow it's so it's
perfect for a no makeup look oh my gosh
my face guys literally my face
but it does it feels really good and
it's perfect for I know makeup day like
at home or whatever when you're bored
it's just like a perfect opportunity to
do a face mask it also smells really
good I'm looking at the bottle right now
and it says it
has essential oil blend of grapefruit
lavender and chamomile so that blend
makes an amazing smell I just really
like it you guys know I've been a huge
fan of origins for a year oh by the way
I'm saying ten minutes there and so I
kind of freaked out a little bit when
they reached out to me to collaborate
for this video so thank you so much to
origins for sending me this product even
though I would have purchased it anyways
because I'm obsessed with origins and
yes this is my dad's while meeting all
so let's just take a moment and laugh at
me as I tried to smile and then I kept
looking at myself in the viewfinder and
laughing so hard because my mouth
couldn't go up in a smile and I was
dying
ten minutes later you wipe it all off
with some water and voila so beautiful
and clean you I love it if you guys are
interested in this product I will leave
a link for you down below in the
description that you can click and it
will bring you to the website the next
step is to use my favorite serum and
I've talked about this many times before
in favourites videos this is from the
same line you know it's just the serum
that goes with the masks and everything
and then of course my favorite
moisturizer ever but they did not send
this to me guys I'm being straight-up
honest I bought this for my trip to
California and I keep rebuy it because
it's perfect and I can just bring it on
the plane with me and I just love the
feeling of this on my skin I also feel
like I'm talking really fast and it's
getting kind of annoying oh I also blend
down my neck because my mom told me that
it really helps with something and I
don't remember what the benefit is but
I've been doing it ever since she told
me that good job Alex
good job explaining last but not least
are the only two makeup products I use
in a day like this so I use the benefit
gimme brow and my EOS lip balm which is
like a strawberry sorbet or something or
vanilla strawberry I don't really
remember but it tastes really good and
then for my eyebrows because they kind
of look disgusting and I haven't gotten
them done a long time sorry guys but I
just used this to kind of fill in the
little gaps because I don't really have
eyebrows and it kind of sucks so I like
to do this because it's fun
as for my hair when I'm lazy I don't
want to like to do anything so I'll
either leave it down I said either
really weird but I'll either leave it
down like this but then I don't really
like when it's in my face so a lot of
times I'll pull it back into just a half
up top knot but like that really messy
one that's just like I'm lazy and I
don't feel like having my hair in my
face so that's basically what I do and I
love it
see it's a pretty messy look and now
let's get into what I wear and what I do
so today I chose to wear my dad
sweatpants from adidas and a simple
brandy top because I'm lazy so I usually
like to spend time on my computer but I
get quite bored very easily and I don't
really know what to do on a boring
summer day when it's supposed to be nice
outside and it's not so then what I
usually like to do is probably go on my
phone a little bit snapchat check my
Twitter my Instagram if you guys want to
follow me on all those things I'll have
it listed down below for you and I want
to get bored of that I like to read
usually when I'm bored you will always
find a book in my hand because I am such
a bookworm I'm currently reading this
one it's called the beach oh by the way
I also play with my dogs because they're
cute and sloppy
and then if I'm really bored I will
spend time hanging out with my sister
watching YouTube videos eating junk food
cuz we get very bored and lazy and this
is what we do for real this is actually
what we do we stalk the saucony Jolie's
and watch their videos and obsess over
how beautiful anna is
you
so I hope you guys enjoy that video
obviously my makeup is a little bit more
done up today if you can't tell even
though it is a little yeah it's still
raining yet but I'm actually leaving my
house today because I'm going for lunch
for my cousin Sofia's birthday so I have
to get myself all done up and you know a
little side Brahe little side reaction
