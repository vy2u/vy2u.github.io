channel I'm try my best not to look
naked I'm wearing a dress don't worry
guys
Valentine's Day is tomorrow yes it is
that time of year again for people in
relationships to be really happy or
single people to be really upset but in
all honesty I don't think Valentine's
Day is that important I don't think it's
a time that you should be upset yeah
it's really nice to spend time with your
significant other but personally Daniel
and I always do things together even if
it's not Valentine's Day when I was
single I used to celebrate it with my
friends if you don't got friends you can
chill with Netflix and snacks and it's
all good don't worry it's really not a
time that you should be that upset over
really it's not that important since I
got so many requests to do a get ready
with me Valentine's Day edition I did
win last year and you guys seem to love
it
this look is not just perfect for
Valentine's Day I think this could be
worn to literally any kind of date or
any kind of dinner it's just so nice I'm
obsessed with the lips guys this looks
like the Kylie Jenner lip color but it's
not but it's awesome its new I'm
obsessed with it so if you are
interested in seeing how I created this
look then just keep on watching so
starting off with a fresh and clean face
I actually like to whiten my teeth
because I've been doing this a lot
lately and I know a lot of you have been
realizing it on snapchat in my blogging
channel and stuff and this is great for
like a date night it works in like 20
minutes it makes your teeth like 10
shades whiter it's crazy it's the
freshest gel on the market right now
it's smile sciences and I actually
figured out this stuff through a lawyer
magazine and also the doctors TV show
talked about it it's cruelty free it's
vegan I love it so if you guys follow me
on snapchat you would have seen me
molding these trays by myself they're
awesome
I know it doesn't like look that great
right here but I promise I didn't mold
them very easy to do there's
instructions on the package makes you
look real funny when you use it but the
LED light helps kind of speed up the
process and it's very very easy to use
does not hurt my teeth I'm very
sensitive teens it doesn't hurt my teeth
the vitamin E just helps protect your
gums from anything and it's FDA
registered it comes with like everything
that you need in the kit
and you only got to leave them on for 20
minutes I am also hooking you guys up
with a code so if you use Alex see at
checkout you can get this $299 kit for
only twenty nine bucks that is a huge
discount and as you can see my teeth are
super super white then I'm just going in
with foundation I still am a little bit
tanned from Hawaii so I'm putting on a
darker shade just to match the rest of
my body to make sure that I'm all
matched up because a lot of times as you
all know my face does not match the rest
of my body and make sure you blend into
your hairline your ears down your neck
you want to make sure that looks all
even and like you can't tell what
there's foundation there
going in with my NARS creamy concealer
my ultimate favorite concealer of all
time I just put it on some blemishes any
red spots underneath my eyes since I am
more tend this is like the perfect shade
for me right now so I blend it all out
with my Beauty Blender I find putting it
down your nose actually makes your nose
look a lot more slender I learned that
through a friend of mine and blending it
out underneath my eyes gives it a
flawless finish
then on to my eyebrows which is always
the struggle and always the challenge
but I am working hard and you guys seem
to notice so thank you so much I am just
using my covergirl like brow pencil
thing that I'm obsessed with because
it's the perfect shade and then brushing
it out and using a little bit of the
other side of this because it's just a
better definer that makes any sense and
then I'm taking this by covergirl as
well and that is just like a brow gel
just to hold them in place I use this in
my Gigi Hadid makeup tutorial look and
I've been doing my rows like that ever
since now I'm taking this Too Faced
chocolate palette which is so cute and
I'm using all these shades to do a very
nice like subtle pinky smokey eye which
uses a lot of nude colors pink colors a
bit of dark purple if you are interested
in any of the products I'll have links
down below
I am just defining my crease with the
darker colors just adding it to the
outer crease making that like deep V
look or whatever I don't know anything I
don't know what this is called I just
watch a lot of makeup tutorials a lot of
makeup videos on YouTube and I learned
from there that's seriously how I
learned how to do my makeup and I just
follow along and I make sure to blend it
out completely
also I focus on my brow bone and
bringing it in towards my nose because
that deepens up the look and makes my
eyes look like I have eyelids because I
basically don't really have them since I
have very hooded eyes and then I just
make sure to blend it out I add the
exact same dark color underneath my eyes
to kind of make it all blend together
and make it look a bit more darker and
Jo Matic because this is a daytime look
so I do want it to look a bit more dark
don't forget to highlight because that's
very important and then I am just tight
lining my eyes and then giving it a
little bit of a wing because I find it's
very sexy and fluttery when you got a
little bit of a wing going on and then
once that is done I am going to onto
mascara I've been loving this Marc
Jacobs mascara I'm obsessed with it it
was sent to me just as a gift and I
actually didn't think I was gonna like
it then I tried it and now I'm literally
obsessed I I don't know if it just
because it's new mascara but it's so
good it does not run down my face by the
end of the night it still looks amazing
it is on the pricey side so I do have
definite recommendations for drugstore
like the one from covergirl the plumpify
is almost identical just a lot more
affordable and then I'm going to be
contouring my face because this is my
favorite part of makeup I don't know why
I love watching people contour their
face and I love contouring my face it's
just so much fun and it looks so good
when you got a good contour going on I
know I shouldn't be using a big Brush
for this but I just do it because I'm
and it works for me putting it
underneath my lip and also a little bit
under my chin to kind of I guess give
definition to that side of my face then
I'm taking a very pale light pink blush
and I'm adding that to my cheekbones and
bringing it up a little bit on my
temples and then kind of adding it to
like my nose and my forehead to just
blend it all together but I think it's
very very pretty and very girly and I
like it a lot and then of course you got
your highlight highlight is like the
most important part of makeup just adds
everything to the look completes it
pulls it all together I love it
now on to the lips I'm using my favorite
lip liner that I use in like every
single video just the lines my lips so
well it's by Charlotte Tilbury but I
don't have a sharpener for it so this
actually hurt a lot when I was doing
this I need to find the proper sharpener
then oh my god guys this lip color what
the heck is this I'm literally obsessed
I don't even know this brand k this was
randomly sent to my APO box
I just fell in love look at this it's
creamy it's smooth it's matte it's
beautiful it looks like the Kylie Jenner
lip kit thing but it's not it's so nice
this look is just my all-time favorite I
think gonna be wearing this all the time
now that like I like to experiment with
makeup I think it's so pretty what do
you guys think do you love it do you

I'm keeping my hair in these braids
