I have been getting a lot of requests to
do a Valentine's Day tutorial and
normally I don't do these kinds of
videos just because I don't think like
Valentine's Day is that important to be
honest
obviously it's nice if you have someone
that you care about to celebrate it but
I mean I don't really take it to the
extreme like Daniel and I do celebrate
it kind of we just make each other
dinner and hang out it's nothing really
special if you don't have a Valentine on
Valentine's Day
whatever who cares like grab your mom
there were many days in my life where I
didn't have a Valentine and it wasn't a
big deal
I just I don't know I just never been
one to like care so much about
Valentine's Day but a lot of you guys
wanted ideas for makeup and outfits and
stuff like that so if you're gonna have
put together something that I would do
if I was like going out with friends if
I was having a look at dinner or
something keeping it more casual than
fancy because I'm not really that kind
of person but if you are interested in
seeing some ideas that I've come up with
and just keep on watching and if you
don't have a Valentine I could be your
Valentine okay sounds good let's go so
because I'm still super tad from
Barbados I need to use my summer
Foundation which is the Amazonian clay
full coverage foundation and then I also
did my eyebrows then coming in with my
favorite NARS concealer I think it's
just the creamy concealer it's the
summer one again and I just kind of put
them on any spots and blemishes that I
have on my face because I want to make
sure that I have a pretty flawless face
for a day tonight even though you really
don't need to do this for a date it
could be for just a party with your
friends or even just hanging out at home
if you want to do your makeup then I
come in with my Porefessional powder and
I kind of get a lot on my hand and then
I put it on the areas that I get the
most shine so it's kind of just like my
t-zone area powdering my face also just
ensures that my foundation will last
longer throughout the night and won't
kind of slide off my face because that
tends to happen sometimes if I don't
powder for blush I decide to use
benefits rocket or blush because this is
such a beautiful pink it doesn't pick up
that well on camera but in person it's
just the
doesn't shine glow I just love it so
much and it's very flirty for a fun date
night so I am officially out of my
Laguna bronzer by NARS it's pretty sad
but I was able to use just a little bit
just to contour my cheeks because I like
to have a little bit more a chiseled
look I just really like the way bronzer
kind of you know makes your face look a
lot more sculpted make sure you blend it
down your neck and I do a little bit on
my nose which is weird but I do that and
then I'm just taking my highlight by Mac
this is the soft and gentle skin thingy
I don't know I'll have everything listed
down below I don't know everything off
by heart but I kind of just apply this
to the high points of my face to
highlight and make it look very dewy and
pretty and I love it
ooh so pretty and dewy now getting ready
for my eyes I'm just using my Too Faced
eye primer I really like this because my
eyelids are kind of oily and this just
makes sure that the eyeshadow doesn't
slip off all night and I don't know I
just really like the way that this feels
on my skin I also then realized how
crazy my eyebrows were so yeah no
comments guys I know trust me I will
have all the eye products listed down
below for you guys but basically I'm
just using a pretty neutral shimmery
color for all over the lid and then kind
of on the brow bone just to give a bit
of a base color before I put anything
else and just add a bit more shine to
the look then going in with a kind of
deep plum maroon color I'm just focusing
this in the outer corner and crease of
my look and then kind of dragging it
underneath my eye and also kind of like
the outer third of my eye just to add
some dimension
blending is so important with a look
like this so make sure you blend away
until you have no harsh lines because
that is like my biggest pet peeve when
it's just like a harsh line like oh I
cannot stand it
then I come back in with that same
highlight that I used on my face I just
add it to the center of my eyelid just
to kind of brighten up the look and make
it look all shiny and dewy as well as
the inner corners and brow bone scary I
know people hate doing this but I find
that it really makes your lashline look
super thick and then of course with a
little bit of a wing I honestly suck at
doing this on camera oh my gosh it's so
hard but I mean this is the best thing I
could do for you guys but you get the
gist of doing a winged liner
then just popping on my favorite mascara
which is the Too Faced better than sex
mascara I am in love with this it makes
my eyelashes super long and curled and
it's just so beautiful and looks like
I'm wearing falsies and I'm really not
on to the lips I'm using this pretty
subtle pink I'm not really drying
outside of my lips that much but kind of
just going around the edges and yes that
is a disgusting pimple boo
I am then using this beautiful matte
color from Revlon I love this especially
for Valentine's Day look it's very like
Ariana Grande and it's so beautiful and
matte but keeps your lips very
moisturized which is good
so this is the completed look now you
can either leave your hair normal or
throw it up into a messy bun or whatever
but I think this look looks best with a
braided hairstyle so the one that I'm
going to be showing you today is just
one that I found from amber fill er up
it's not one that she normally does I
kind of just like mixed a bunch together
some that I really like but basically
you take a small section from the top of
your head near your part split that into
three sections and start French braiding
down towards your ear so I'm kind of bad
at showing this but basically all you
want to do for a French braid is grab a
section from the outside bring it under
the middle section and then do the same
on the opposite side until you get to
around your ear and totally correct me
if I'm wrong but I think when you go
under the middle section that's actually
called a Dutch braid not a French braid
I'm really not too sure but whatever
that is you just want to go under the
middle piece picking up other strands as
you go down
I was concentrating so hard that I
actually started tearing that happens to
me sometimes is ever happen to you guys
so when you get down to your ear you
actually want to stop French braiding
and just do a regular braid all the way
down to the end of the section secure it
and then you're gonna start pulling out
the braid so do not be shy pull out all
the strands to make them look super
thick trust me it looks so good at the
end
so this is what it should look like and
then after that I just have some
extensions clipped in these are the foxy
locks extensions I'll have the link
listed down below they're my absolute
favorite basically you want to start
doing a fishtail braid so you're going
to start grabbing sections from the
inside and pulling them to the outside
you're gonna be able to see in this
video because I'm very about explaining
it but it's kind of like an inverted
fishtail braid I don't know what else to
call it but I love doing this with
extensions because it makes your hair
super thick it makes the braid super
thick I love the look so as you can see
here I'm taking a section that's small
from one side bringing it underneath and
adding it to the opposite end and just
keep doing that all the way down and
then when you get around a few inches
down you're gonna actually start
braiding but you'll see that in a few
seconds
so when you get to be a few inches down
you're actually going to take one of the
sections and then split that into two so
then you have three sections you're
gonna braid that a little bit just a
regular braid going underneath the
middle strand and then whatever strand
is the thickest you're going to split
that into two so I usually do the middle
one and then start fishtailing again so
you're just gonna keep doing that all
the way down fishtail then braid then
fishtail and again if you want to see a
more in-depth tutorial I will link
Amber's tutorial down below because it's
amazing and looks so nice
so when you're done securing it you're
actually just gonna be pulling out the
pieces and making them super messy I
usually like to go crazy and especially
because I watched average tutorial I saw
how much she pulled hers out and it just
looks amazing so don't be shy girls or
guys don't be shy
so this is the completed look I
absolutely love it I think it's like so
romantic and pretty but also really cute
if you want to wear it just with your
friends and stuff or you can even just
recreate this for any other event you're
going to it doesn't have to be
Valentine's Day because I think this
would look perfect with literally
anything dressed down or dressed up it's
awesome so for my outfit I decide to
keep it quite casual I do not like
dressing up fancy so I am wearing this
pink turtleneck sweater that I got from
Univ I love it it's so soft and very
subtle pink and then my favorite booties
from Matisse and then these jeans
they're kind of like a light wash grey
color I'm not really too sure how to
explain it but they have just the rips
on the knees I love it and yes that is
me dancing my life is a joke so hope you
guys enjoyed the video if you have any
other suggestions for videos that you
would like to see obviously hairstyle
videos are coming very soon
don't worry about that let me know what
your plans are for Valentine's Day and
if you're not celebrating it what are
you doing on Saturday are you gonna be
chilling hanging out going to a party

just like get together and like have a
summer party and watch Valentine's Day
together because that would be a lot of
fun if you did enjoy this video please
