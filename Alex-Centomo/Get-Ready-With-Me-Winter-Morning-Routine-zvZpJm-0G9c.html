what with every changing season I like
to switch up my routine all the time I'm
sure a lot of you guys know this by now
if you've been subscribed to me for a
while but I change up my products my
hair products based products makeup
products all the time I love to switch
it up especially for different seasons I
live in a place where we have four
seasons winter being the longest one so
it is very cold right now and since my
skin does get very drying I switch up
everything so my morning routine
definitely changes a lot and I know so
many of you guys love seeing my morning
routine videos so I decided to make
another one for you guys showing some of
my favorite products at the moment let's
get into the video mornings are usually
quite hard for me especially when it's
winter because it's so cold and my room
for some reason just never gets any heat
in it so I have to like pile myself with
blankets and I get all cozy and then
getting out in the morning it's like the
worst thing ever like here's a funny
face normally when I wake up I've been
doing this thing lately where I actually
just put my phone away I don't look at
it at all I stretch a little bit to get
my posture in check and make my neck a
little bit less stiff because that
happens overnight and then I like to
light some incense a really good trick
is to put it in like an orange or
something to keep it stable and then as
well as on top with some kind of like
cup holder so the ash can just fall and
I really like this one because it smells
like black cherry and it's very calming
soothing and the reason why I do this is
because I've been meditating in the
morning ever since London I've been
doing this for around 10 minutes in the
morning at night I find it really helps
clear my mind and helps me relax and
feel more comfortable and I just start
the day with a really fresh head
and I'd like it a lot so I then get up
and I head to the bathroom and wash my
face so I've been loving this new
product it's by Gloucester and it's
called the milky jelly cleanser I use it
every single morning to wash my face
it's made with rose water and Polacks
myrrh which is found in contact lens
solution so it's very gentle on the skin
and the formulation of the five
ingredients helps leave the skin very
comfortable and smooth never tight and
you could also use it at night to remove
makeup and oil and stuff and then I
follow up with the moisturizer and then
head on over to my makeup so I have been
doing this like kind of everyday makeup
thing every time I wear makeup which is
not every single day but on days I do
wear makeup I like to do kind of the
same thing for winter make it very
bright and highlighted and the cleanser
from before actually really helps like
liven up the skin and make it look a lot
more bright and a lot more awake which
is something I definitely need for the
cold winter months if you guys are
curious and seeing how I did my makeup
let me know in the comments down below
because then I could just like film this
actual tutorial for you and show you
exactly what products I use because it's
all drugstore very inexpensive super
simple and the makeup is flawless which
I'm obsessed with for the winter months
because it just looks so like Elsa and
snowy and pretty and yeah also don't
forget to check out the link to the
cleanser down below it's very
inexpensive as well and it's like so so
so good I'm obsessed with it um I've
actually bragged about it on my vlogging
channel which is great because it is
winter I have been loving these dark
lips so this is the color that I chose
for the day I think it looks very
beautiful and like Snow White and then I
move on to my hair so I take down my
hair which is always a struggle because
it's always and a huge knot and I
actually like to leave a natural because
you know no heat is great so what I
decide to do today is take two strands
from the side of my face or head then I
bring it behind me and I actually start
to fishtail them so it's very simple
fishtailing you take one small section
from one side cross it over and add it
to the other section it's kind of hard
to see what I'm doing here because the
struggle is real but if you guys are
curious there's like
a bajillion fishtail tutorials on
YouTube I also have a few of you guys
wanna check it out where I really go
into detail and I just kind of go all
the way down with this like some hair up
some hair down kind of look and then
when that's all done I secure it with a
clear elastic and then I actually just
pull out the braid to make it look very
thick and full because I don't really
like tight braids actually they're kind
of a pet peeve of mine so I just pull
out my braids like crazy to make it look
very full and thick and this hairstyle
takes like maybe five minutes very
simple and looks super cute and looks
like you took a lot of time to do your
hair and I get a lot of questions when I
wear this out in public people are
always like oh how did you do that I'm
just like it's just a fishtail guys but
it's so cute I love it so much it is
then time to change out of my PJs which
are always very comfortable and I don't
like doing but I like to put on some
more comfy clothes so all black is
definitely my thing for the colder
months I also threw on this like really
fluffy sweater because it's so comfy and
cute but I think being comfortable is
like the greatest thing ever
and yeah I'm digging this outfit guys I
think it's really awesome I was very
inspired by Gigi Hadid of course because
her style is awesome
