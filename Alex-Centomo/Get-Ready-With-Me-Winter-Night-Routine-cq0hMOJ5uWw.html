what's up everyone welcome back to my
channel I said that's so weird
I've been getting a lot of requests to
do another routine video and I know I
have like literally hundreds on my
channel already but it is a new season
it is officially winter cuz it is
snowing it so much so of course I'm just
in a very festive wintry mood right now
I'm starting to slowly decorate my house
a little pieces here and there and so I
decided I would do a winter night
routine because I know a lot of you guys
and love these videos so much I just
can't get up in the snow right now like
it is actually beautiful outside of my
house it's crazy if you watch my vlogs
you will know this this snow is so
pretty at this time of year I'm gonna be
showing you guys what I do when I get
ready for the winter time because
obviously my skin and my hair is very
different throughout the seasons plus
where I've moved is a lot more dry so I
have to use different products here
because it's like so drying to my hair
and my skin so I've been doing things to
help out with that a lot and of course a
huge thank you to Pantene Olay and
Gillette Venus for partnering with me on
this video and if you guys are curious
to see what I do at night then let's get
started also weird oh my god
I typically shower after I eat because I
like to shower at night and my favorite
thing for the winter has been the
Pantene 3 minute miracle deep
conditioner I use the moisture renewal
one because my hair usually gets so dry
this time of year but this product has
actually been doing wonders for my hair
even you guys have noticed and have been
making comments about it so thank you
and I really like it cuz it provides so
much moisture to extra dry hair and it
only takes 3 minutes I know a lot of
people skip this step but I personally
don't like having cactus legs even in
the winter and the Gillette Venus twirl
racers always my go-to because it's
super smooth and can get all the
hard-to-reach areas this razor actually
glides super easily the flexi ball in
the middle is great too because it
allows you to get those hard-to-reach
areas like your knees and your ankles
so onto my face the Olay Regenerist
luminous overnight mask has been my
miracle product guys seriously I have a
very dry skin in the winter but when I
use this at night I wake up with
radiantly hydrated skin it's crazy it's
like magic it absorbs and works
overnight and it helps with my skin tone
and discoloration it also helps with my
past skin damage and my last go-to
product for this time of year is the
Olay eyes illuminating eye cream this
stuff reflects under eyes with a
luminous glow so I gently massage it
into my dark circles to correct their
shadowed look and illuminate for a
bright and even glow you guys can see
it's so beautiful it's highlighted I
wake up in the morning and my eyes are
like bright I look awake I've noticed a
huge difference in my dark circles under
my eyes after time with this product
it's amazing once all that is done
I definitely moisturize my legs I think
this step is really important especially
if you shave you just want to make sure
that your skin is nice and moisturized
then I go in and grab my pajamas change
into those and make myself some tea I
got this tea kettle recently and I'm
obsessed with it I love any kind of
sleepy tea just to have at night and
then I curl up on the couch with Daniel
and we typically been watching Christmas
movies which just really makes me happy
and then once that's done I just head on
over to bed I actually don't have Wi-Fi
in my room so that means no phone at
night which is perfect I get an amazing
night's sleep
ready for my workout in the morning good
night so I hope you guys enjoyed this

big thumbs up to let me know don't

you're new and don't forget that I love

video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
