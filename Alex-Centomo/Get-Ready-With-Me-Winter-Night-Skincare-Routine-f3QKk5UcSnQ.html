my channel so awkward Alex oh my god
today I decide to film my much requested
winter and nighttime routine last time i
did a nighttime routine was actually i
think last year like for winter time I'm
pretty bad at being consistent with that
I love making morning routines I do
those like every season but for the
nighttime routine because i usually
don't really switch up my night products
um I haven't really been doing it that
often but I looked back at that one I
was like okay I do everything is like
completely different so I figured I do
it updated 1 plus with the winter months
I feel like it's very different from the
summertime because my skin does get very
dry because where I live it's very cold
so if you can't tell I have a cold
because it's freezing outside um but
it's fine because it makes me excited
for Christmas the only issue is is that
it's not snowing so for Christmas I'd
like it to be snow snow I like there to
be snow when it's Christmas but there
isn't any snow which just cold so I
actually filmed this video over at my
grandmother's house because I just think
the lighting in her bathroom is just
amazing plus she isn't the biggest tub
and the coolest shower so just why not
pleasures away so and without further
ado let's just get into the video off to
grandmother's house we go I'm here
honestly because my sister's been
house-sitting and I love her house so
much it's so cozy and big and fun and
I've been loving the sweater lately it's
from I forget the company but i'll leave
it down in the description it's just so
soft and comfy and it's a turtleneck
there's Kyla sneaking up behind me so on
to my face this is normally if I'm
wearing a full face of makeup this is
what I do to wash it the first thing is
tie my hair up because my lion's mane
just gets out of hand by the way sorry
it's so echo in here I'm actually
recording this at my grandmother's house
once that's all done I like to take off
my makeup when I'm at home I use this
cleansing oil from bosha or bosca I
don't really know how to pronounce the
brand name just dissolves all of your
makeup it's really great for liquid
eyeliner
and as well as work with my scare it
gets it off all at once but when I'm
traveling I usually use makeup wipes to
do this step wow scary
quite recently I've been using this
device right here this is the ultimate
skin spa by vanity planet and I just use
my regular face wash and then I put it
onto the brush there's actually three
brush heads when a silicon ones an
exfoliator and one is just a really soft
gentle one and it's really awesome
because it enhances the absorption of
your other skin care products plus it's
really great for traveling because it
comes in that little kit and look how
much dirt came off my face after using
this product it's actually gross then on
to my toner so this is by it kodály and
you got to use a toner so that way it
opens up all your pores so that when you
put serum on like this one it actually
absorbs into your skin I honestly am NOT
an expert I don't know the science
behind this but this is what I've been
told by many skin care professionals to
do that step it's very important and
then using this midnight oil oh my god
this stuff makes your skin feel amazing
especially when you wake up in the
morning it just leads your skin so
hydrated and fresh and glowy I love it
then I change into my pajamas which this
is just a boy's t-shirt that I stole
recently huh it's really comfy and then
I put on some fuzzy socks and christmas
pants cuz i love it cuz his time got
these at Victoria's Secret and then I
danced around in my grandma's bedroom
because it's fun why not right and then
I hang out with patches my grandma's dog
and my sister who clearly was happy that
I was filming her and then she decided
to hug patches he's a great dane by the
way that's why he's so big and then i
got tucked up into a my grandma's bed my
sister slept on the other side and we
had a little slumber party so i hope you

well as like my lipstick I'm not wearing
any a nail polish but I'm gonna try to
start doing that as like more of like a
I'm a trend what am I looking what's the
word I'm looking for I'm gonna get into
the habit of putting what I'm wearing in

any other suggestions for video

comments I kind of want to do like a
holiday pamper night routine because
I've been doing those like once a week

just feels really good to relax so let
