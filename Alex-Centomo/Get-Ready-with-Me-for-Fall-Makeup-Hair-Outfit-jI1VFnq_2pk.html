breathe and it could last forever it
wait found on the let you and I got lost
in it in life was it never works but
never better
oof that pimple though so I'm just
starting off by priming my face and I
really like to use the benefit
Porefessional primer just because it
gets rid of all those disgusting pores
and then I come in with my NARS sheer
glow foundation and I've been trying
this out for this month and I really
like it I was kind of scary because i do
have oily skin but it does not make my
skin oily looking at all I just said it
with some powder and it's perfect I
really like the finish of it and it
makes my skin look super dewy and pretty
and I love it for the fall time then I'm
just popping on some concealer on to
that disgusting zit that you saw earlier
oh my gosh i'm using the NARS creamy
concealer it's just my favorite
concealer does not dry out my skin or
anything and it just covers it up
perfectly and then getting rid of those
under eye bags cuz yuck since my skin
does get dry in the winter months I like
to just set underneath my eyes so that
way I ensure there's no drawing
happening all over the place and then
I'm going in with some of my benefit
hoola bronzer to contour my face and I
just do the typical contour just blend
in that away then blend blend blend
yes this is kind of a one click but yep
and okay this is my favorite blush for
the fall time oh my gosh it's so nice
and subtle I just love it i will leave
everything listed down below for you
guys if you're curious as to what
products I use and then I'm going in
brushing my eyebrows and attempting
attempting being a keyword to fill them
improperly because I still do not know
what I'm doing and I'm working on it k
guys working on it then just brushing
them out and putting on some of that
benefit gimme brow stuff that's supposed
to make your brows look super thick and
I actually really like it then going in
and priming my eyes with the Too Faced
shadow primer thingy and then using wood
winked by Mac i love the shadow so much
for the fall it's just a shimmery bronzy
gold color and it's super nice and
flattering then just dragging that under
and adding some print into the crease
and kind of outer corner area and
blending that out it's kind of a dark
grey color and I really like this mixed
with the bronze
then I'm just highlighting my brow bone
and my cheekbone and the little Cupid's
bow over my lip to give that nice dewy
finish that I like for the fall time and
then just blending that out tight line
scary a creepy but got to get that done
if you want those thick looking lashes
and then I'm just attempting to do a
nice winged liner I kind of mess up a
little bit but you can always fix that
on to my favorite mascara which is the
Too Faced better than sex mascara it is
so awesome i love it makes your lashes
look super full then I'm just outlining
my lips with my favorite lip liner by
make it forever I use this with like
every lip color which it doesn't match
with but I just really like it onto my
favorite fall lipstick by Mac this is
called diva it's just a really dark
matte shade and I love it especially for
the full time and it kind of reminds me
of Miranda sings for some reason I don't
know why stall be kidding that was my
really really bad attempt of around his
things Oh time to tackle that hair and
today I'm just going to be leaving it
natural like this kidding but I'm
actually leaving it natural and then
just using some of my bumble and bumble
texturizing spray I love the stuff
because it gives you hear so much volume
and texture and I just think it's like
super sexy bedhead and I love it
