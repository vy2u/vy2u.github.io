channel I've had the same intro for the
past few years now and I don't know how
I would start my videos but that's just
how I do it
so I asked you guys on Instagram I think
last week which video you guys wanted to
see next because I'm doing a back to
school series so I wanted to do either
back-to-school lookbook or back to
school how to get healthy kind of thing
and as you can see from the title of
this video this is what you guys chose
I'm going to doing a lot more of these
things on Instagram so make sure you're
following me there as well as Twitter
because I do want to keep in mind what
you guys want to see and don't worry a
back-to-school lookbook is still coming
I just want to know which ones you want
to see first but also I'm trying to
upload more so I think I might throw in
a few videos in between my back to
school series so it's not just like back
to school like back to back but you know
what I mean like it's not just like a
bunch of like back-to-school videos like
once a week it'll be like a
back-to-school video then a favorite
back-to-school a travel video a
back-to-school you know it kind of mix
it up and then as we go into fall it'll
go into fall and all that fun stuff so
make sure you leave a comment down below
letting me know what you want to see but
to start off this video I just want to
say that when it comes to getting
healthy or getting into shape you know
all the kind of stuff I have a lot of
videos posted about this stuff but I do
feel like my back to school videos tend
to bring in a lot more new viewers so hi
can you make sure to subscribe I just
want to express that I think it's really
important to stay healthy to kind of
extend your life line not just for
specific times in your life like you
don't want to just get healthy for
back-to-school I mean it's a really good
start but I think it's definitely
something that you want to change for
your lifestyle because it is important
so yes getting healthy for
back-to-school definitely a good step
and I do think I have some kind of valid
points or things I can help you guys
with to get motivated to get off your
butts and get head and outside and doing
something active but again it doesn't
all come down to like physical activity
although that is a huge important step
in getting healthy but I'm just going to
jump right into it because this video is
going to be kind of rambling but really
do try and listen and try to apply this
to your life because I do think that
this can help you guys out in so many
ways and I just really want to be there
for you guys and I want to help motivate
you and just you know give you all along
the happy life step one I think the most
important thing in getting in shape
getting healthy all that stuff is to
drink water and I cannot express this
enough I know and like every single
video out there
anytime you search anything about trying
to get fit trying to get healthy trying
to get in shape weight loss whatever it
is people always say drink water and
it's kind of like a you know you would
think it's a common-sense thing but the
amount of people I've met in the past
few months that like don't drink water
it's crazy I mean I used to not drink as
much I try to drink a lot more now
because it not only does the help with
your health but helps the skin your hair
everything you know it's amazing and
it's so important for your body yet so
many people tend to drink like soda or
juice or other things that's not water
and they realize that go through a full
day without having one glass of water
and to me that's crazy so step one drink
a lot of water I know sometimes it might
be hard if they're not thinking about it
but I do think that bringing around a
water bottle or making it fun like I
love to have water and like a mason jar
with ice and lemon slices and a straw I
just drink water so fast when it's like
that if I'm like outside or a super busy
drugged and I'm at home I'll fill up a
huge bottle with ice and lemon and a
straw and I just make sure to kind of
resell it throughout the day you'll
start to see a huge difference when
you're drinking a lot of water I'm
telling you guys I also think it's
important to do like first thing in the
morning when you wake up take your huge
set of water step two would be to try
and cut out as much sugar as you can I'm
not talking about like natural sugar
that you can fruit or whatever I'm
talking about processed sugar this is a
struggle of mine because I love sweets
like I'm a chocolate eater I love
cookies cookies are my weakness I don't
know what
is not the biggest sign of like cakes
and stuff but cookies
simple chocolate chip cookies always
will get me and it's hard because sugar
is definitely I mean it does the same
thing in your brain that like cocaine
does and that's like pretty intense it
really seems the same chemical so I can
understand why sugar is super addicting
but it is really not that good for you
at all so I mean I'm not saying to cut
everything out of your diet completely
because in my opinion when you do things
like that you end up binging at some
point or relapsing or whatever it's just
everything in moderation so I would
suggest letting yourself have something
once a week or twice a week if you have
it every day you know cutting back a
little bit will actually make a huge
difference and eventually you won't
crave it as much and I have friends that
haven't had sugar in like years but I'm
saying for me like I know I always end
up with I'll go a month without having
it it feels so good and then like
probably one bite in like binging you
know because it's so good so I just
think it's better to do everything in
moderation whatever you listen to your
body that's the most important thing
listen to your body and you know if you
feel like having a piece have a cookie
you just don't eat like ten of them then
step three
exercise exercise is very important
because you want to get your heart rate
moving you want to get your blood
flowing you want to get active start
sweating and this is something that I
think is like the hardest for most
people it's pretty I mean it is hard to
like focus on eating and what healthy
versus not healthy and stuff especially
if you're in like college and you're on
a budget whatever when it comes to
working out a lot of people think oh I'm
not a gym person I don't like going and
working out in front of people oh I have
so much homework to do I have so much
this to do I'm so tired like blah blah
blah I've heard it all I've been there
trust me guys but I'm telling you once
you get into a routine of being active
you're going to wonder why you were
never like that so my personal favorite
thing to do is work out first thing in
the morning because I find when I get up
early and I do a workout I feel good for
the rest of the day I don't feel like I
have more got to do later on the come so
tired like
I'll just go tomorrow like I have been
there I like that's kind of what I do so
I think first thing in the morning going
to work out
it gets you motivated for the rest of
the day it gets your heart rate up early
in the morning and you feel so energized
for the rest of the day and you don't
really feel like guilty about eating
what you want because you have like a
really amazing workout first thing in
the morning I know this is hard when you
are doing a lot of hours of homework and
studying and all that kind of stuff but
I do think this is a perfect time to
start because it's the beginning of the
term beginning of the semester and you
can really get into starting routine and
getting yourself into habit of working
out in the morning but if you prefer at
night that's totally up to you when it
comes to the whole gym thing you don't
need a gym membership to work out I have
so many videos on like what I do when I
work outside but I'll include some clips
because I think if you're at a school
and there's a football field a soccer
field any kind of outdoor area where
there's a bench or anything like whether
it just open space you can work out you
don't need any equipment if you have
equipment it's just a bonus or just
something extra but you really all you
need is your self motivation water
headphones and music if that's what you
like and somewhere to workout dorm room
you can totally work out on that too
sometimes I'll just like like YouTube
some at-home workout videos and I'll do
like the ABS or the legs or whatever it
is but I think the most important thing
is getting your heart rate up so doing
15 to 20 minutes of like light cardio
just even if it's just walking like go
for a walk speed walk whatever is just
to get your heart rate up a little bit I
prefer doing things like jumping jacks
running I love to run so I'll run around
like football field or a soccer field
especially when I was in school that was
like something I did all the time any
kind of thing that just gets you moving
I think personally it's better to
continue with some kind of core
exercises just to kind of build some
muscle that also does burn calories
doing abs arms legs you can do all of
this at a football field could do it all
at soccer field you could do it at any
open space really all you need is your
own body and making sure that when you
are working out you're trying to do
things properly and I know
kind of hard if you like don't really
know what you're doing but have somebody
check on what you're doing for the first
few times or really make sure that your
body is in proper form when you watch a
video because the last thing you want to
do is injure yourself but I do think
exercising is something that it's just
really important to me and it's a part
of my life my lifestyle and I think that
it can be a part of yours - there are
fluffs flying around everywhere yeah so
what I typically do is three sets of 15
or three sets of ten depending on what
it is
sometimes three sets of three sets of 20
and when I see three sets it means like
let's say you're doing squats you do 15
squats take a 30 second break 15 squats
again 30 second break 15 squats again
you're done something like that you know
and I don't think it's necessary to do
all of these exercises in one day
I think it's good to focus on specific
areas of your body per day and take
breaks if you want and if you don't like
doing stuff like that do something else
you like again go swimming go hiking
anything bike riding like anything just
like to get yourself active something
that you enjoy because there's nothing
worse than like wanting to work out but
hating it every single time you do it
you're just going to get to a point
where you just don't want to do it
anymore so I think it's really smart
just to find something that you enjoy
doing because you're just what you're
going to want to do it longer in that
case for me I like going to the gym but
I used to not like it I just got used to
it and now I really enjoy it and I hate
not going now I do think it's also
important to take days of rest so that
your body can regain its energy and
relax you don't want to start off too
intense if you don't work out at all try
three times a week if you do double up a
little bit more and every time you feel
like you're you're doing these exercises
and you're getting so used to them you
could switch it up you could start
adding to it adding little weights doing
more reps try to make it harder every
week so that your body doesn't just get
used to it because you won't see any
different then when it comes to weight
loss this is something that I think
really comes down to the kitchen like I
said before sugar is a huge thing but
eating healthier I felt so hardened
you're in college and like you're on a
budget and you're trying to like you
know eat healthy and healthy foods
sometimes they're super expensive and a
box of mac and cheese
like super cheap but in reality spending
a little bit more money on the healthier
foods is probably better for the long
run because whatever money you're
spending now is going to be left on like
health problems later on in life like
that's how I see it I always look like
long-term kind of thing so definitely
let yourself indulge don't cut back like
a tremendous amount baby steps and
everything in moderation it's very
important to listen to your own body
like I said before and I do think this
is my personal personal opinion but I do
seen calorie counting is like not the
smartest thing you need to be in like
the right headspace to be able to do
something like that because I have seen
people go overboard with it and they
become obsessed and at least eating
disorders and all that kind of stuff so
yes calories in versus calories out is
going to help you lose weight but you
don't want to be intense as long as
you're being active as long as you're
eating a pretty balanced healthy diet
you're going to be fine you're going to
lose weight you're going to be healthy
it's going to be good and eating as much
food as you want what is healthy is so
good because you don't really have to
worry about like calories or anything
like that because you're just filling
your body with nutrients and think of
your body of the machine you want to
give your machine as much energy as
possible and healthy food equals energy
in your body you're going to feel better
you're going to sleep better you're
going to be more awake in order to study
like all these things you're going to be
able to do and your body is going to
definitely thank you for that later so
anyways I hope this video could help in
any way get you more motivated get you
to get off your butt and go and do
something and also don't let physical
appearance dictate anything in your life
like in all honesty it comes down to
what's up here how you are as a person
how you are as a human being if you're
going to put out positive vibes positive
positivity is going to come to you be
good person be nice be helpful these
sweets people around you if you see
someone getting bullied if you see
someone having a hard time help them out
Karma's are definitely a real thing and
I do think that by putting out that
confidence or that positivity you're not
going to have as many insecurities in
life and do realize that people that
upset you or bully you are having their
own insecurities it typically doesn't
have anything to do with you it's
usually something that's going on in
their own
so keep that in mind if ever you're
feeling down know that I love you so
much I know that I've always here for
you if ever you need anything I'm here
for you love you guys so much so much
love for you guys
