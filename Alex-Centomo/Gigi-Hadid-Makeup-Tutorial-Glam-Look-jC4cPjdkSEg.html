channel today I just had to do my much
requested gigi hadid makeup tutorial I
get this question on a daily basis from
you guys on YouTube Instagram every time
I put selfies even like snapchat and
Twitter a lot of you guys say I look a
little bit like her which is such a
compliment because I think she's
stunning I get either Gigi Hadid Karlie
Kloss or Taylor Swift like all the time
those are my top three things and I love
them all so honestly like greatest
compliments ever thanks guys lot of you
wanted to see a Gigi Hadid makeup look
so I'll link the picture down below in
the description just cuz I don't want to
post on the screen for copyright
purposes everything just gets so washed
out on camera though like that's the
annoying part is that my makeup looks
way more intense in person than it does
with this lighting
so just forewarning for you guys if you
recreate this it will look a lot more
intense than it does on screen also in
the picture she had more of a nude lip
but I'm really really am loving the
brown so I kind of like took two of her
makeup looks and combined them so like
the eyes the face is like the picture
down below and I do know she wears brown
sometimes so that's what I went for
today plus since it still is winter you
can totally get by wearing a dark lip
and I think this is perfect so if you
are interested in seeing how I created
this look then just keep on watching
stuff guys so starting off with a clear
face I actually mix two foundations
together to get me that like I guess
proper color actually film this before I
left for Hawaii so I'm kind of pale but
I was like in between a spray tan and
being completely pale so I had to mix
the two foundations together to get me
that perfect shade to match the rest of
my body because if you guys don't know
already my face never matches the rest
of my body the struggle is real so I
just blend it in with either a Beauty
Blender or this brush that I got from
Sigma and then I am just using a bit of
concealer on blemishes and also to
highlight my face because Gigi has a
very like highlighted face very very
highlighted under eyes it kind of
reminds me of the Kardashians a little
bit how her face is always like glowing
and really really pretty so I'm just
using a few of my faves to highlight
once that's all pat in and done you're
gonna want to set your foundation and
concealer because Gigi does have very
like like not a matte skin but you can
tell that her face is powdered and then
highlight is put on on top it's not like
completely dewy so I'm just going in
with a bit of bronzer to contour because
she always has such a nice contour going
on her cheekbones are to die for
and I'm blending that up the side of my
temples and then down under my chin as
well it's also gonna add some warmth to
my very pale face here I'm so glad I
have a tad right now but I'm just
counting the days till it goes back to
this color
then on to the brows I'm actually
growing mine out at the moment so kind
of excuse the mess
but Gigi's eyebrows are actually awesome
so very arched but they're also always
brushed up I don't know I think it's
kind of cool to be honest so I'm using
my brush to kind of just put them in
place before I fill them in and then I'm
taking this liner that is seriously
incredible it's awesome it's by
covergirl and the shade is just so
subtle and great for my hair type they
have a lot of different colors but this
one is just perfect so I'm lightly
starting to fill in my brows as well as
bringing some like brush jokes upwards
because that's the way Gigi's hairs are
I'm doing it very subtly at first
because I don't want anything to be too
harsh her eyebrows are very very light
especially in the picture and then I'm
using this like brow gel to kind of set
it in place on the sides and it looks
very messy but that's literally how she
had it in the picture and I think it
looks so cool so I'm gonna do this to
both my eyebrows and then you'll see the
finished product
then going in with eye shadow I'm using
the nudes palette by covergirl which is
freakin amazing I love this palette so
much it's really inexpensive the colors
are incredible very pigmented very
blendable they do not crease which is
great so I took a very light color and I
put that all over my lid and then I mix
two Brown shades to put into my crease
as well as the outer corner do you just
make up was very intense in this look
but it was very nicely blended had a
really deep crease and she kind of
similar eyes to me which means that
they're kind of like hooded so I really
examine the picture and try to recreate
it as closely as I could she also had a
shadow underneath her eye and it was all
very nicely blended so that is what I'm
doing right here love it so much I think
it's very it looks very subtle on camera
but in person it was very intense and it
was really pretty and I'm taking the two
lightest shades and I'm putting that in
the inner corners to brighten up the
look because she had a very very glowy
inner corner which I love and then I am
putting that under my
raus on the brow bone to kind of I guess
highlight that area and high enhance my
hairs and then I tightline my eye with
just a regular black eyeliner and then I
put a little bit on top of my lash line
to kind of smudge it out to make my
lashes look a little bit thicker than
they are because I don't have very thick
eyelashes and then I am putting a white
liner on the waterline you can use
either a white or a like skin colored
one and then I'm using this new mascara
which is my favorite mascara of all time
right now I'm obsessed with it I used it
every single day in Hawaii it's by
covergirl I'll have all the links listed
down below for you guys but this helps
really lengthen and add so much volume
to your lashes it's crazy I really
focused on like the outer corner and
look how nice it's making them look look
at this look at the difference between
the two sides it's crazy and then just
focusing a little bit on my lower lashes
because she was wearing mascara there
even though I don't really have a lot of
lower lashes oh my gosh the lashes are
just so pretty they almost look like
you're wearing like individual falsies
but you're not and now on to the lips
she's wearing a very nude lip color but
I wanted to kind of do a more brown
color because I've been obsessed with
this brown shade from covergirl recently
so I'm over lining my lips because
Gigi's lips are quite a bit larger than
mine so I'm using a nude liner to do
that not too intense because I don't
want this look to look I don't want this
look a look I just don't want this to be
crazy also excuse the dry lips that's
really disgusting I'm so sorry now I'm
taking this shade 275 which is like a
coffee it's actually taste like coffee
it's amazing look how nice this is so
it's very like moisturizing it's not
drying it's such a nice color I love it
and then ask for the hair I just put it
up in a messy ponytail like she had in
the picture really messed it up and that
just completes the look I think it looks
amazing and I love the eyebrows I want
to continue
we do this and then I'm just taking a
blush like a coral pink color and adding
that to my cheeks to add the shimmer cuz
that's what she had and I'm obsessed
with this makeup look I think I'm gonna
be wearing this all the time when I go
out and do things and of course adding a
bit more highlight to the cheekbones
because her cheekbones I just can't get
over them I'm obsessed with her guys
can you tell Daniel gets really annoyed
because all I talk about is GG that's
really annoying over it
I hope you guys enjoyed the video I
really had fun doing this tutorial I
love doing makeup and I know this look
is just so amazing I just don't know
what I'm gonna wear it to because I
never wear this much makeup but I keep
swinging my hair because I love it it's
in a ponytail if you guys enjoyed this
