and I'm just extremely excited because
their roller lash mascara is literally
the best thing ever i'm not just saying
this like i went to the store like three
times last month with my cousin Sophia
like you can ask her and I was like
asking them like once the roller lash
coming out they didn't have it out and I
didn't realize that the mascara didn't
come out till the end of februari so now
that out i'm super excited because i
have it and it's just like the best
mascara ever doesn't smudge makes your
lashes super long anyways you'll see in
my video so I'm excited to announce a
little giveaway not a little a big
giveaway for you guys at the end this
video but make sure you're watching the
whole video and don't skip forward and
yeah let's just get started
so I thought it would be fun to show you
guys a little girls night that you could
do with your sister or your best friend
so obviously board games and movies as
you can see Kyle and I love to dance
around to Greece and then of course a
Polaroid camera you can't have a girls
night without that and then some makeup
goodies because I love to do my makeup
with my girlfriends on my sister and
then of course this cute little tote bag
to keep everything in let's get started
obviously you don't want to wear too
much makeup when you're doing a girls
night but sometimes it's fun just to put
a little bit on and these are a few
pilots favorite products so of course
the professional primer by benefit it's
literally a life saver and the rocket or
blush super cute and gives your cheeks a
nice highlight one of the ways that Kyle
has the most perfect brows ever is
because she highlights underneath and
that just accentuates everything now on
to my new favorite mascara guys
literally this stuff is amazing i'm not
just saying that like i had been going
to the store for a month to find this
product and it's finally out it just
gives your lashes such a natural and
full look and it makes them look super
long without being too fake and it's
just like the perfect mascara and does
not smudge it's amazing let me know in
the comments down below if you guys have
tried out the mascara and if you love it
as much as i do or tweet me because i
love seeing your thoughts on products
that i love I mean look at this my
sister's eyelashes just look amazing I'm
also a big fan of giving my cheeks a
kind of flushed natural look like as if
i was just playing outside for a little
bit so i love the Benetint because that
just gives you the perfect flush and of
course moving on to the mascara because
i have really short eyelashes but look
how long it makes them it's crazy guys
Kyle and I are big fans of taking
pictures especially polaroid pictures
because there's so much fun and we just
have a blast taking them and we look
crazy and then sometimes we get into
little arguments but you know that's
okay we're sisters we love each other
maybe not so much
growing out my sister and I loved
playing a Candyland and mouse trap and
this is just like the newest version of
candy line and it's so much fun but my
sister always wins and it's really
annoying but you know what it's okay I'm
not a sore loser hot chocolate or tea is
also a must for my slumber parties and
David's T is just great I love it so
much and of course a fun movie to dance
along to so Greece is just me my
sister's favorite movie ever as you can
see she's danced into greased lightning
because she's a rock star duh and then
