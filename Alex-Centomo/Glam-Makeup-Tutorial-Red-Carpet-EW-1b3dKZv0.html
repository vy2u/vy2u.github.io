channel I recently was sent a bunch of
products from Elizabeth Arden which I'm
so grateful for if you guys follow my
vlog channel or mean Dan's daily vlog
channel you would have seen all the
products because I was so excited when I
got the gift bag and I thought I would
do a video kind of based around the
products and also since it is the
Toronto International Film Festival if
you guys don't know I'm Canadian
so kind of represent Toronto yes I
thought I would do a glamorous makeup
look something that I would do that's
pretty simple and easy but still looks
beautiful for any type of event that you
have but specifically targeted towards
the Toronto International Film Festival
/ TIFF whatever you want to say but if
you're curious to see how I did this
makeup look then just keep on watching
to start off I put my face with the
super start skin renewal booster by
Elizabeth Arden I love this stuff so
much it's the first step to my skincare
routine after cleansing my face I use it
before a serum it just helps to boost
the efficiency / results of my skin care
products so it just really helps
everything all around and I like it cuz
it's for all skin types
then I go in with my serum and I think a
serum is really important to help your
skin it just helps with anti aging it
protects skin against environmental
factors serum is really good then going
in with some lotion this has SPF 30 in
it which is really great and I just
really like the feeling of this
then using the Prevage city smart this
is a protector like skin shield kind of
thing it's a shield pollution and UV
protection and I use it after or on top
of my moisturizer so it just helps extra
protection and great for any kind of
makeup look that's going to go on
afterwards
then using a primer before my foundation
this just helps the foundation last all
day long and makes it look flawless it
helps kind of fill in those fine lines
that I have and then the foundation that
I'm using is the provide foundation with
SPF 30 and this creates a really
luminous complexion which is why I
really like it for any kind of glamorous
event it perfects like makeup but treats
like skin care which is really important
for me because I'm really trying to
protect my skin lately and it contains a
lot of benefits that help keep your skin
protected it's for normal to dry skin
which is what I have it's oil free and
it has a light to medium coverage so you
could totally build it up if you wanted
to
then going in with some highlight the
stuff really brightens up any look I
love it so much is perfect for any kind
of photography because it really
brightens the under eye area and I think
it looks stunning makes me look awake
makes me look glowy
then go on in to set it because I want
to make sure that my makeup stays on all
night long this stuff is really
important for me just because I don't
like my makeup to smudge once it's put
on my face
then I'm gonna fill in these brows
because this is the struggle guides I
tell you in every video it's a struggle
but this product has helped me a ton
as for the eyes I've seen a lot of
celebrities wearing a very basic eye and
you guys know all about basics and all
about neutral colors so I thought this
would be perfect this eye shadow palette
is beautiful the colors are stunning
it's very pigmented but it's very easy
to blend I really like it a lot
you guys know I can't do any kind of
fancy event without liquid eyeliner this
step is very important for me I do a
very small tiny line and a little wing
it's like my signature thing but I do it
all the time and I would never skip this
step especially for a glamorous night
now onto mascara guys this mascara I
have never tried anything like this
before in my entire life this is the
grad entrance mascara and oh my gosh you
guys are gonna see how amazing it makes
my lashes I have very short lashes and
this just makes them look beautiful and
increases volume length curl and has
like such a nice precise brush it's
amazing and there's no clumps and no
flaking which is you guys know how
mascara flakes on me all the time or
smudges and I just love this then going
in with some blush
I like this plum color I think it's
perfect for fall and terrific through
this time of the year and it's just so
beautiful
now going in with my beautiful color
bold liquid lipstick I love this color
so much it provides the coverage and
intensity of a lipstick with the shine
of a lip gloss which is perfect and it
moisturizes my lips
it's long-lasting and it has a push up
applicator so you can actually just like
push the product up into you can see
like the little sponge thing going on my
lips you can actually dispense the
products afterwards
and this is the finished look guys I
love it so much it's simple it's
beautiful and it's classic
so I hope you guys enjoyed the tutorial
don't forget I'll have all the products
listed down below for you guys and a
huge thank you to Elizabeth Arden for
