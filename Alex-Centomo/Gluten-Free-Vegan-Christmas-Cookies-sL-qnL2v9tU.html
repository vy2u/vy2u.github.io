Kristina and we decided for this holiday
season
to make some cookies we're gonna well
I'm gonna attempt to bake she's really
good at making actually we started today
because I've been obsessed with much tea
lattes
recently I was like we should totally
get together and make some much uh
cookies for Christmas yeah summer first
today yeah so this recipe is vegan it's
gluten free we are using no or is it
dairy no it's all me okay so non-dairy
so everything's really really good we're
it's the first time we're making this
yeah so we actually don't know I found
this recipe online so we should probably
that's the element it's ready but yeah
we found the recipe online I guess we
can we'll say where we go I can also
just link it down below for you guys to
if it's good you can see right now well
close in on that okay so for this recipe
we don't actually need a lot of
ingredients which is nice it's kind of
why we chose that number one ingredient
matcha you can confine this set any
grocery store I think I bought this one
at the store near my house matcha and
this is a fine harvest French story but
it's powdered it's green so it's kind of
like fish food actually it's great we're
gonna be using almond flour for this
recipe because alex is gluten-free and
it's just a healthier option to it's
basically just ground-up almonds I'll
move them already up almond milk which
is very Oh Mandi it's gonna taste really
exciting it's gonna be like
oh yeah okay um we're using coconut oil
instead of butter we're going to be
using vanilla if the recipe calls for
sugar you can use any kind of sugar we
have brown sugar here too but Richard
sometimes changes the consistency of a
cookie and we're going with go away sure
you know what we're being healthy on
every other area usually yeah well it
should be sweet baking powder and some
salt so we're going to be using this
beautiful food processor it's really
heavy you can really use anything that
you can use like an electric hand mixer
or if you don't have that you can use
like a fork and a spoon and just like
every year we do this thing with my
family yeah it's like the Christmas
baking thing yeah I know I'm here and
every year
Cristina and Alvaro getting so into it
and there's me antisocial Alex being
like I don't like baking I'm not a
social I just don't have to get involved
because I'm bad at it so measuring stuff
measure it fun Oh got it
um one thing about baking that's really
important is you actually have to follow
the recipe because it's like you yeah
it's chemistry so you really have to
follow the right quantity at specific
elicits a preheat oven done you got
preheat the oven to 350 that's Carinae
Fahrenheit mixed together the almond
flour sugar baking powder and salt okay
so almond flour remember I just told you
you don't have to measure everything
okay it's easier when you have it like a
bigger things and you could just put
your scooper and and unlevel it right
yeah I Oh CDs like you can you can you
can do that if you want and I feel like
I need to knock him in now we need a cup
of sugar I usually put less sugar than
the recipes but not in this one no no no
like all you want to do cookies sugar
then I feel like it's not gonna be too
sweet yeah we'll see one teaspoon so one
is okay the blunt end of a knife is a
good thing to use to level measuring
stuff like this oh damn I need a quarter
teaspoon of salt
yeah I miss having me on YouTube she
gave me it's all like vegan natural like
sugar-free dairy-free oh yeah really
good Mimi I can't choose a youtuber oh
yeah yeah do it she's awesome
okay so now we're gonna pulse it cause
this be cool because we don't have to
it's just drawing grants was just sort
of to make that you can really do this
with a fork
I definitely better so you do it to a
beat I'm gonna scrape the sides here off
so that it all goes in there we go well
that's one okay
so then four tablespoons of the matcha
powder
come on a clean surface jump out your
dough oh it looks like dirt
oh yeah boss not yeah it's a bit mealy
like it's a bit rat grainy yeah cuz it's
almond flour if all else fails like if
we can't cut the cookies out we'll just
make little balls and let's push them
into cookies yeah
okay I'm doing it okay you're not you
don't like cookie dough no nothing wrong
I mean I just don't like it is it it's
good delicious
yay
so we put them in the oven for 10
minutes that was it 3 350 and now we're
just playing some icing sugar so it
looks like snow and that one looks like
he got covered in an avalanche you could
do this with a sifter but we couldn't
find one so we're just doing like this
yeah homemade yeah oh nice
okay guys moment of truth
meet you oh I like the icing sugar on
mm-hmm oh yeah mmm I'm gonna do it
I'll go they're crispy you could enjoy a
bit longer but I wouldn't but it's the
perfect amount of sweet mm-hmm I find
yeah you really taste the matcha in the
almond it's not like overpowering but
it's really delicious yeah oh yeah
big thumbs up I recommend this if you
guys are interested in the recipe I'll
have the link down below so that we use
we followed it exactly
I think it'll only make a difference
like I know there's different kinds of
matcha you can buy em hmm and I think
like some are stronger than others but
really it doesn't matter it's gonna be
good either way I'm just gonna sit here
and enjoy so good I fetch mine already
