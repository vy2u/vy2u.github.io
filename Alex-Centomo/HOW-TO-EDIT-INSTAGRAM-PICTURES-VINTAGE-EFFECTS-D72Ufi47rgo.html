channel or welcome if you guys are new
here this video is gonna be all about
how I edit my Instagram pictures I've
done a few of these videos in the past
but I feel like this is the first time
in a while that I've really switched up
the way I've been editing my pictures I
feel like they're really taking it to
the next level when it comes to photo
editing making it more of an art versus
just like throwing on a filter and
uploading it and I used to be all about
that like putting on a build a filter
from the vseo and just upload it like
that but I feel like I've been taking my
pictures and looking at them as more of
an art form and being really actually
passionate about the way I edit my
pictures and when I say edit I don't
mean like altering my face altering my
body that kind of stuff I mean colors
tones lighting all that kind of stuff
vintage effect I've been doing this like
grain and like vintage you look and all
my pictures lately and I get a ton of
questions about that so it's all gonna
be in this video if you guys are new
here make sure to hit that subscribe
button also make sure to turn on the
post notifications so you guys are
notified when my videos go live because
then it is frustrating like I just don't
know what to do anymore with YouTube so
give this video a thumbs up if you guys
want to see kind of tutorials on
specific not filters but like presets
that I do all that kind of stuff so I
want to start off by saying that I do
use Lightroom if you guys don't know
what Lightroom is Lightroom is an app
with Adobe and Adobe is a monthly to
subscription so I just pay for the like
photography one so I think I don't know
like I'm from Canada so I don't know if
it's like this everywhere else but I
think for me it's nine dollars a month
and with that you get like Lightroom
Photoshop a bunch of photo editing apps
on your computer and I use my computer
to edit all of my pictures make my
presets and a preset is basically just
like when you're fixing lighting colors
tones everything in a picture you're
able to save that and like not just save
the picture of it save like the editing
that you did and like title it something
and then if you upload another picture
to Lightroom you can apply that exact
same editing onto this picture tweak it
a little bit if you think it looks weird
but that way all of your pictures are
kind of in the same sequence they're
very similar so it literally is a click
of a button to edit a picture
once you've edited one and you like the
way it looks so I wasn't against
Lightroom like I would use Lightroom on
my phone but it's definitely not the
same as using Lightroom on the computer
and then another trick I found out is
I'm actually able to transfer my presets
that I made on my computer onto my
Lightroom app on my phone so now it's
even easier for me to edit a picture and
I'm gonna show you how to do that but I
don't just use what room I use Lightroom
for like the basics I'm gonna show you
how it makes a picture look amazing and
then I'll show you what I do afterwards
to get like the vintage effect and
grainy kind of things so yeah this is
not gonna be a Lightroom tutorial this
is just like me applying my Lightroom
preset onto my picture but the reason
why I've been putting this video off for
so long is because a lot of people are
going to want to use my presets and I
know a lot of people start selling their
presets and I wasn't like against it and
I wasn't for it I was just like whatever
I make my own presets and then I just
use them if you guys are curious and you
want me to start selling my presets let
me know because it did take me like so
long to make them and so much time and
effort that I wouldn't just give them
away like for me it's like a it's like
hours of hard work so I don't want to
like just give that away for free I hope
you guys can understand that if you guys
are wanting me to start selling them let
me know in the comments down below
because then you can use the exact
filters that I use I'm gonna show you
guys in a second how awesome it makes
your pictures I have this like album my
phone called photography and I don't use
all of these apps at all they're like
some of them are like super old that I
haven't used in years but the main one
is the Lightroom app so I'm just gonna
click that normally like in the past I
would do this on my computer but because
now see you could see it says presets
and there's three pictures in there
those are the three presets that I use
the most out of everything and those are
the presets that you're gonna be seeing
on all my Instagram pictures so as you
could see it's like very basic haven't
done anything to it yet it's literally
just me sitting on the side of the
street looking like typical Alex like I
was in the middle of laughing or
something and normally when I choose a
picture it's typically ones that I'm
like in the middle of doing something
because I just like them they're more
natural I uploaded that that I'm gonna
go into the presets these are the three
and these are just examples don't mind
our faces but I'm gonna go into the
three dots on the top copy it settings
then I'm going to go onto this picture
three dots on top
paced settings and look at that look at
that difference guys like if I tap
before after before after the tones the
color is like I'm so much more tend
everything is warm it's nice it's just
like such a difference and I use this
especially this one I use it on like
almost every single in my pictures there
are a lot of green undertones in it so
on if you could tell it's I mean I don't
like green but there's definitely like a
hue of green this is why this video is
like kind of stupid because all the hard
work goes into making the presets and
then it just takes two seconds to
applaud onto a picture but that's why
for me it's so easy once the presets are
done just to apply them on to my
pictures because it's just so simple
like everything's done but then
sometimes I'll go into facetune to like
edit out a pimple or something or put
detail but that picture kind of like it
as it is
do I go into the SEO then what I do is
once in a while I'll see what a 6 looks
like on it it's a little intense so I'll
bring it down a tad point it really
doesn't do anything I put too like point
6 yeah like that didn't do much at all
then I go into this and I don't touch
anything other than grain so I scroll
all the way down till grain and this is
how I get that grainy look so I go and I
put usually around like 3 depending on
the picture I'll zoom in to see the
grain like that looks pretty good I like
the grain on my leg
I like the grain on my face maybe I'll
put it down a tad to like 3 and then to
get it to look very vintagey and like
you know that it looks like an old
picture that has been like through I
don't know how to explain it but like
white marks on the picture there's after
light which is here or there's after
like 2 and I like twos after like 2
because there's just more options so I
go into this picture upload it to after
late - you could use after late one as
well but these two little circles you
click them you go to dust then you see
have all these options on the bottom so
I usually like to use this one dust 5
and like sometimes I'll zoom and I'm
like I don't really like the way it
looks so I click it again and it
switches it around so which is it around
you can make it lighter darker you can
make it black so if you wanted to like
have the black as you can see up here or
bring it up - white have the line going
through it like you can do anything you
want to make it
like look super vintage II look I
probably wouldn't do this one with the
line I probably play around with it for
a little bit but it's that's basically
what I do to get this like super cool
vintage II fuzzy thing and then another
thing that people don't know is there's
this app called huiji and with HUJI you
can actually like take a picture or you
can upload a picture to make it look
like a disposable okay that color is
like kind of insane I don't like that at
all I usually use it like when I
actually take a picture in real time but
as you can see here it has like the
numbers to make it look like it's a
disposable picture and that's how I get
those types of photos sometimes they
look like this like this was real time I
took one in New York it's cool it's it
adds like lights sometimes and then
another thing that people ask me this is
not about my Instagram pictures but
about my Instagram videos and my stories
how do I get that like vintage filter
looking video and that is 8 millimeter
it's an app you do have to pay for it
but oh look at this you can see yourself
hi you can change how it looks
can change your buns a bunch of things
about it but yeah that is basically how
I edit my Instagram pictures it seems
super simple and quick because I use
literally three apps but like I said
it's all what I do in Lightroom it does
take a while and I started off by
purchasing people's Lightroom presets
learning how to play around with
Lightroom like that and then creating my
own based off of colors and tones that I
like so again if you guys are curious to
see my Lightroom presets or to purchase
them for yourself let me know and give
this video thumbs up and if enough
people want them I will start selling
them because it's just based off of you
guys if you want them or not yeah if you
guys like this video give it a thumbs up

you guys better I want to interact with

your Instagram username so I could stalk
