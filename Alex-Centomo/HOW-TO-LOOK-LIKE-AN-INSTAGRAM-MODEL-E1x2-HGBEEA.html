channel on my blogging camera right now
because I'm currently in st. Lucia but I
wanted to put out this video for you
guys because I recently saw it on
YouTube I don't remember exactly who it
was it was like all my recommended and I
watch and I was like that is such a cool
idea so I'm gonna do my own twist on it
I'm gonna link the girls channel down
below I'm gonna go find it I know last
time I couldn't find the person who
started the tag that I did but you guys
are awesome you put in the comments so
thank you for that but this one I'm
definitely gonna go find this person
because there's not many videos of this
on Instagram I'm gonna link her down
below so you could go check her out
check out her videos I saw this one and
I've just really liked it I liked the
whole idea of it and I hate the term
Instagram model I mean it is a term and
technically that like is my job because
I started modeling through Instagram and
now it's my career I wanted to kind of
give a twist on like what it's like to
take pictures for my account I take
pictures with my phone if you guys
haven't seen my video of how to get a
sick Instagram feed I'll link that down
below you can go check it out if you are
new here make sure to hit that subscribe
button down below and also turn on those
notifications so you guys are always
notified when my videos go live and give
this video a thumbs up if you want to
see how I edit my Instagram pictures
that is coming soon don't worry guys so
if you are curious to see how to look
like an Instagram model then keep on
watching so there's definitely a huge
difference between being a real-time
model versus an Instagram model and I
think the term Instagram model just kind
of happened in the past two and a half
years and that basically just means
people that are modeling and posting
their pictures on Instagram for fun and
sometimes might get jobs that way by the
way I'm not naked I think when it comes
to being an Instagram model it's all
about how to just know your face I say
practice in a mirror that's kind of the
best thing I used to always do that I
like pose myself in the mirror find out
the angles of my face what looked good
and then test it out on camera
especially on film and play around that
way don't be nervous
to act really confident in front of a
mirror it's kind of fun sometimes
because then you feel like really good
and sometimes I'll just like play music
try on outfits when you start practicing
taking pictures and you look at yourself
you're like wait a minute do I really
like this but I mean that's probably the
best way to start
and then also having someone to be able
to help take your pictures is a big deal
someone that knows your angles so as
long as you know your angles and you
know kind of what position looks good
you can kind of tell your friend or
family member who ever is helping you
take a picture if they're not like a
photographer who shoots with models and
who knows maybe you know your face best
but I'm just kind of letting them know
what to do when it comes to shooting
yourself and then as well as that you it
all has to do a lot with editing - and
I'm not saying editing your face your
body like all that kind of stuff it
comes to colors tone lighting all of
that is what makes a picture look
amazing but for right now Kat and I are
going outside to shoot and I thought I
would give you kind of an example of
things that we do that I get inspired
from and want to shoot my sunglasses
right now bujji
so another thing is location scouting we
are right now trying to look for a
location that would suit our feeds but
also our tastes and sometimes if we do
get inspired by something and we want to
recreate it we try to look for something
that's similar so we're just kind of
walking around our hotel looking at
walls looking at colors for example this
wall right here it's super sweet because
the white and the green but like this
would probably would have been my ideal
thing to shoot also the shade but it's
still sunny outside so you get good
lighting but we're trying to incorporate
more colors we're going to try take
pictures in the sunlight so we really
like this background we saw that another
day and we're like well we love the
trees we love the building but it's in
the Sun so we're gonna try and see what
we can do with this and this all comes
down to editing
okay so scrap that it's like way too
bright even like play around with that
at all and the Sun you see how it's like
all the way up there it's not low enough
right now is that we could take Sun
pictures like especially with the fact
that we're just using our iPhones so we
need to find a better spot that's like
just in the shade but has a really nice
background but this actually looks
really cute it's in the shade you got
nice plants in it with a mix of white
and green the side to is really nice so
we're gonna try doing it around here I
actually scrapped that this is a sick
car so if you take a picture with this
I'm gonna put my camera here
I'm blue
it's called skills girl hopefully you
guys stay
that's actually funny
how funny is that guys like literally oh
there's a spider web so I hope you guys
enjoyed the video if you did make sure
to give it a big thumbs up to let me
know obviously it's like you guys take
this lightheartedly don't take this so
literally the term is kind of a weird
thing and it definitely is my job but
you don't need to be perfect to be like
an Instagram model as long as you just
show your personality and be yourself
and have fun taking your pictures with
your friends look for cool locations get
inspired by people on Instagram don't
forget that I love you guys so much and
stay tuned for a video this weekend
that's coming out I'm so excited about
it
hello guys in this abandoned amusement
park we come to life when it turns dark
we're just carnival hearts you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
