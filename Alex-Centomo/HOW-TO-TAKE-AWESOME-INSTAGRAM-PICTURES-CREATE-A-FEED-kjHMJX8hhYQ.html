another vlog do you guys recognize who
that's from if you do a comment down
below oh my gosh my self-tan is so bad
I'm so sorry but you guys really seem to
like this blog style video thing and I
think it's really fun it's a lot more
personable personable personal what's
the word anyways it's currently a crazy
snowstorm outside and I picked today of
all days to film this type of video but
whatever I shoot in all types of weather
so it doesn't really make a difference
for me as you can tell from the title
this is all about how I take my
Instagram pictures if you guys don't
follow me on Instagram you should
because self promo why not I figured I
would do this video a little bit
different because for one we might not
actually be able to shoot today cuz of
like how crazy the snowstorm is but I'm
gonna answer some questions that you
guys asked me on Instagram and I'm gonna
answer them with Mel you guys don't know
who Mel is she's one of my good friends
she also does Instagram I was like her
job for her Instagram is more like
photography Instagram like it's like
goals her pictures her editing is just
like on a whole nother level so I
thought it'd be really cool to compare
mine versus hers and see like the
difference is pros and cons and just
kind of talk about Instagram and just
say how like everything you see online
is most of the time not 100% real and
we'll get into that later but if you
guys are new to my channel make sure to
subscribe down below and click that
notification button so that you never
miss a video and also give this video a
thumbs up if you want to see a how I
edit my Instagram pictures so without
further adieu let's go get now back
choose my favorite singer coach ever
yes I just I just flamed it no she
taught me how to do a flip when I forgot
how to do my double oh that I'll take
credit for Mel and I are here today
because I had this idea well I get
questions a lot about Institute about
Instagram on Instagram about Instagram
how I take my pictures how I edit them
I've done a few videos in the past of
how I edit pictures obviously things
change all the time depending on the
seasons yeah but I thought it was really
good to have Mel here because we have a
very different vibe on Instagram like
our feeds are completely different
definitely I mean I was saying earlier
for them to go like look you up because
I was like your fetus goals like you're
like it's just goals but I thought it
would be really cool to kind of just
talk about the differences in both of
our passions when it comes to Instagram
I'm instagramming a whole would think
about it and also photography if you
guys are actually interested in that
because that I mean it's a whole
different story though protect yourself
is a thing you know it's not all for
show on Instagram I guess we could start
off by saying what we use to take our
pictures yes let's do it
we're about to get real real with you
guys okay I'll go first so so when I
originally started on Instagram I was
shooting everything with my phone and I
was editing in visco which I guess we
can like talk about later yeah but now I
actually then I upgraded to a camera
which at the time was a Nikon d3100 I
think that was taking like these in
pictures and then I upgraded to the note
she has yeah he's on it oh yeah I have a
weatherproof case on it right now but
this is the nikon d750 and it's a
full-frame camera um so it's definitely
a lot heavier than a phone oh my god you
travel with this yeah girl I know it's a
backache that it does deliver all of my
beautiful travel photos and the reason
why I love using this is because if I
ever want to blow up any of my pictures
like put them on the wall
of my future home oh my god then I
definitely wanted one of these babies so
the lens is a 24 120 so it does zoom in
quite a bit which is great see all the
pores and it does have an f-stop of 4
for someone that's starting off with
photography if they want to purchase a
DSLR yeah I feel like you need to kind
of practice before you upgrade an
upgrade because I feel like for
someone's first you know something I
don't know if that's the best option No
so I'll be honest this camera is I think
about $3,000 Canadian so that's like a
pretty good investment in the
photography so you want to make sure
that that's like something you want to
pursue and get to like understand
settings and understands like how you
shoot manual I definitely suggest
learning how to shoot in manual don't
just shoot in Auto especially if like
photography something you want to get
into and then my camera it's really hard
to use you really need to be pro
photographer to be able to use this type
of camera because there's a lot when it
comes to like you know the iOS out the
iOS I thought you meant nice so when I
started laughing oh yeah that honestly
no I just used my phone and a lot of
people asked me what camera I use and
every time I say my iPhone they're like
what to be honest the cameras and the
iPhones have gotten so good yeah I
wouldn't even tell the difference I mean
an Instagram like a photographer can
tell the difference like I could tell
the difference between your pictures in
my pictures okay this is why I want to
talk about this too because like what
you want to do on Instagram and this
might not just be for Instagram in
general yeah just for fun but like it
depends what you're like interested in
doing so if you want to do Instagram as
a career let's say and you want to do
more of like the travel lifestyle thing
investing in a DSLR is important because
I mean you're kind of up against the
best of the best when it comes to that I
mean not just that you want to make sure
that like if this is something that you
want to do like one of my concerns was
well what if I want to have like what if
I want to blow up these pictures yeah
like you know I've tried like blowing up
pictures like from my camera and like
they just get really great and
and it's fine like I can I can put them
on like little Polaroids but yeah like
in terms of like larger photography like
I eventually want to go to Iceland and
like I would love to take these like
beautiful landscape shots with landscape
shots in Iceland that was kind of like
where my head was at so it's not just
what I'm doing on Instagram like that's
all great in terms of like my future and
like the types of cameras I want to be
using like this was where my head was
that for me it's all about the editing
because just taking an iPhone picture
and then comparing it to how I edit is
like a whole different ballgame and we
can do a whole different video about
editing because I mean I use Lightroom
for editing I know you use like yeah do
you use Photoshop too sometimes
no I don't really know how to use
Photoshop okay I've used Photoshop once
it took me nine hours to be able to put
stars in the sky and it looked really
stupid but I posted it it didn't look
stupid you actually did a great job
literally I did it and I forgot who was
maybe Kyla she's like why would there be
sky stars during a sunset and like the
pink sky like you know what we were -
Kyla yeah I was like what
whatever honestly it's fine the iPhone
is a great place to start
yeah I'm hands down like a lover of the
iPhone photography and it's so easy and
I sometimes wish like for Instagram
photos I could go back to do you find it
hard to travel without having to like
upload and stuff and like have to bring
your computer because sometimes I don't
travel with my computer pictures are
taken on this camera the SD card goes
into the laptop and then the hard drive
goes into the laptop and then everything
from the SD card goes onto the hard
drive and then everything from the hard
drive I can then put into Lightroom and
edit that's the process so I need the
camera the laptop the hard drive every
time you travel yeah well I mean it's
doable for sure it's just more of like
it's more and yeah just like more
equipment more like bulkiness when you
travel and like it's fine like you have
to kind of like take the good with the
bad and it's not really bad to be honest
like I bring way too many clothes when I
travel I don't need to bring five pairs
of shoes for three days you know it's
like it's not I think there's gonna be
pros and cons to everything just like
the con is just like the heaviness of
all the
for me the common be the heaviness of
that camera it's like such a baby like I
love it but then it's just like it's a
head like holding that especially if
you're gonna like go on a hike or
something want to take pictures of a boy
I've actually done it Brooke in Costa
Rica Delaney Joan yeah
what do you mainly focus on when you are
taking your Instagram picture okay so I
feel like this is a kind of good
introduction for what I want to talk
about so because we shoot completely
different I think it would be
interesting to talk about let's say if
we are gonna shoot how do we get
inspired for pictures why do we focus on
when we take pictures like what is like
our you know vision and kind of how we
get our ideas all that kind of stuff so
I don't know about like what you do but
one of my favorite things if I see a
photo that I really like online whether
it be Tumblr Pinterest Instagram I'll
save it and I'll same kind of recreate
it in my own type of way sometimes I'll
just be doing something I'm like oh I
want a picture with this background I
really like it I'm on Instagram a whole
lot and I'll just like scroll and save
certain pictures I love that function oh
my god me too
I don't know when we go out to shoot
it's like for me so stupid cuz it's like
literally Daniel like this I know I like
with it and I'm like okay do a different
angle and he's like what do you mean
like I just don't like it okay so what
do you like I don't know just change it
okay we just had it we have to restore
the camera I don't know saying angles
are important angles oh that's great
memory angles are super important
especially when you're starting out and
there are definitely angles that you
don't like whoever is taking your
pictures just have them like do a couple
of like different angles whether it's
the closer to the ground more to like
where your heart is or like above so
just like moving it around like side to
side I'm figuring out what you like but
also it's not all about the way you look
tree my favorite shots are candid shots
yes people want to connect with you and
the best way to do that is just to show
what you are in real life
and we both just like love like candid
shots and like like legit laughing and
I'm capturing on
camera is like is the best and those are
the pictures you go back on and you like
remember like that exact memory and
exactly what you were saying at that
moment yeah I much prefer those photos
over any other photos you can tell when
someone's on being themselves online
like it's pretty obvious and I just find
like Mel you're like the sweetest person
ever out of anyone I know no but
honestly she just has the biggest heart
and it really comes across especially on
your stories I find your very sweet like
opening your packages or mom by the way
her mom's in a storm like how sick is
that storm like she lucked out in the
name Department that's sick I think for
me I'm I'm very like hyper and like
spastic and loud and Ariel like I don't
stand for people's both bit or anything
and I just kind of like I am Who I am
and if you don't like me in like I don't
care that's fine you know I just kind of
do it I yeah not everyone's gonna be
your cup of tea yeah exactly and it's
not my mission to make people like me if
you will like me that's fine and if they
don't and that's fine too like
everyone's allowed to have their own
opinion and I don't know is there
anything else we should like to talk
about I feel like people had so many
questions do you plan out every one of
your pictures that's the first question
okay no no not every single one winter
sometimes it's very like on the fly like
they'll go to a location and be like
love this love this let's do that or
sometimes you just are like chilling
with friends and you're like oh my god I
really like we are can i grab a pick and
you're also like very much like
lifestyle photography CEO for sure do
that for me like I have to oh yeah oh
that was another question actually like
do you plan your shoot days or do you
just kind of spur the moment if it's
like snowing and I want like a beautiful
like snowy situation and it's like
alright
pack up the camera let's go hmm but
other times it's more like hey do you
guys have stuff to shoot today why don't
we do it on Friday when it all works for
everybody and then we can just kind of
go out
location and shoot um how often do you
shoot I guess it depends like when I'm
traveling I take a lot of pictures just
cuz I'm not traveling you got to take
advantage yeah when I'm home I feel like
I'd plan a shoot day and I just kind of
take pictures on that day unless I'm
like out at lunch with a friend and I'm
like oh let's just take a picture or
something you know okay do you plan out
your feet in advance yeah so I use
bounnam
I say Anna I say noonim cuz that's test
showed me the app and she's as Unum but
like she's from the Midwest I don't know
anything
Tess I think we're gonna take it from
you good I like the way it sounds better
yeah I plan it out if I have like a
white picture and then a dark picture I
don't want to have another dark picture
I want you white Dark Knight you know
like something like that flows nice I
think that's important I like things
spread out evenly if I'm gonna change my
feet I want to make sure that I have
like a few pictures lined up that
they're gonna like go with that picture
yeah is it like it looks pretty if
you're just doing Instagram for fun
there's like no need to worry about that
stuff but in terms of like aesthetically
pleasing onnum um
definitely a good app to use okay scroll
and pick oh my god close your eyes no
stop on that Kylie we stopped on your oh
come on you don't appreciate so this one
who takes your pictures usually Daniel
either Lisa or bear or Jess or whoever
I'm traveling with probably take my pic
or your boyfriend oh my boyfriend
maybe Malkin film like as if she was
gonna take a picture of me but just film
it and I can like pose yeah we can do
that that is so embarrassing
okay the honest truth about this is that
it is going to be a pose because you're
you can't be moving while you're taking
a picture yeah so that part of it is not
it doesn't feel super natural at first
but it does mimic the way that you look
in real life right right but wait okay
cuz maybe that's a DSLR thing because I
always move
yeah an iPhone it picks it up yeah I
mean I shoot like in bursts sometime so
if I'm doing like some like some
movement then I can do it but for the
most part I'm like doing something and
stopping and then doing something than
stopping I got my earmuffs and we're
going out to shoot now guys don't judge
me the way I pose gotta do it for the
ground so he found a cool path and Mel
sometimes says that she likes to line up
with their iPhone to see how like to try
out a shot with an iPhone to see like
what it would look like instead of
taking out my camera right away that is
cool okay so this is how mal poses wait
bring out this screen that's cute
we got mostly just walking just natural
guys I just got some sick pics of Mel I
was typing her out the bomb in a smoke
bomb it will smell bad I just say it
abominable snowman abominable abominable
Obama Obama now your question the
abominable snowman is MSA laughing
candid shot right here cute and now you
can see before she edits and then you'll
see what after she edits all right let's
go through let's go through Alex's poses
I never really do full body like I
usually do from like here up especially
if it's like this I'm not gonna take off
my jacket cuz like if that usually I
like go like this I smile I like put my
tongue out or sometimes I'll like hold
the snow and like smile I'll just pose
this is so awkward myself this is like I
want to be freakin crawl into a floor
and die and then as for hair pictures
like I can't it's gonna be hard right
now but like I'll like stand with my
hair back and I'll just like swig my
head like I'm just like I'll go like
this like or like hand-holding ones I
like hold the head like I'll walk I'll
like actually walk oh my god I love you
so much mouth so I hope you guys enjoyed
this video I hope it was helpful in any
way if you guys have any other questions
feel free to leave them down in the
comments Mel and I will go through them
and answer them just like by typing and
stuff I feel like we've covered
everything but I'm not sure if you guys
do want to see a video of how we add it
maybe we could do something like that
together yeah you could show you a
preset she does have presets and she
actually does sell them if you guys want
to try out a package for yourselves cuz
I think that would be kind of a cool
start yes to use a lot of people have
been telling me that they've actually
learned through presets like how to use
like yeah that's interesting and I mean
I use Lightroom on my phone it's
completely different so I mean I'll use
it sometimes on my computer but yeah if
you guys did enjoy this video make sure
you give a thumbs up don't forget to
follow me on Instagram and let her know
that I sent you and comment down below
pineapple if your evenness or if your
repeating this I don't I'm saying it's
all good I love you guys and I'll see
you at my next video bye in this
abandoned amusement park we come to life
when it turns dark
