baby I love you and he just got neutered
so that's what we're dealing with right
now welcome back to my channel guys I
first just want to say thank you guys so
much for all the love and support on my
last video that was so nice it was
something that I thought was a little
bit different and you guys all really
seemed to like it so if you guys don't
know what that is my friend and I taught
you guys how to take awesome Instagram
pictures
I'll have that video linked down below
and also if you guys want us to do a
video all about how we edit our
Instagram pictures give this video a
thumbs up to let us know and also while
you're down there make sure you
subscribe to my channel if you're new
and turn on those what is it little bail
notification thing so you guys never
miss a video and without further ado
let's just get into this video this
video is sponsored by nature's way and I
just want to thank them for
collaborating with me on this video but
also thank you guys because honestly
like I know there's a lot of stigma when
it comes to sponsored videos but those
of you that have been around for a while
know that I genuinely only talk about
things that I agree with and that I use
on an everyday basis and there are so
many things I say no to and those of you
that are new here I want you guys to
also understand that I never try to like
just throw things down your throat I
genuinely believe in the companies that
I work with and there's no point in
promoting something that I don't like
because then what's the point you guys
are gonna purchase it and you're not
gonna like it and then you're not gonna
like me so like why would I do that but
also because getting these opportunities
allows me to live the life that I live
and do the videos that I would like to
do for you guys and be able to create
the content that I want to do for you
guys so I want to thank you guys so much
because without you I would be nowhere I
want to never get opportunities like
this in my entire life so a huge thank
you to you guys fitness and health are
definitely a huge part of my life go boy
if you guys haven't watched my what I
eat in a day I did speak briefly about
how I took December to be kind of like a
whatever month so I wasn't really
working out I was eating whatever I
wanted I definitely felt crappy like I
did not feel good and it really makes a
difference when I am active and when I'm
eating healthy when I
working on you know when I have a goal
and working towards something it just
really helps with my physical appearance
but also my mental health that's a huge
factor so I do have a few goals or 2018
when it comes to fitness and it when it
comes to health health ties in with
Fitness because I do believe they go
hand in hand but in health I mean like
what I'm putting into my body and also
how Fitness ties in with that so my main
point that I want to get across for not
just this video but like in general on
my socials is just health as a whole and
so I'm going to with my channel be
putting out a lot more fitness related
videos and that's what I want your
guys's advice on if you guys want me to
actually like fill my workout and then
upload that or kind of talk about it and
upload that or give you guys links to
like my favorite workout routines to
follow on youtube if you want videos
working on at home at the gym when
you're traveling outdoors indoors like
whatever you guys want to see let me
know because I feel like that really
motivates me and motivating you guys
also motivates me so I feel like whoever
wants to kind of join this journey with
me that would be great
as well as more health related videos
mental health physical health overall
like what I'm putting into my body so I
just wanted to know your thoughts on
that I do switch out my routine quite
often so let me know what you guys want
to see along those lines of me staying
on track for my health goals of 2018 a
really good way is with herbal
supplements and this is something that I
find really important especially with
what you put into your body
herbal supplements just really helped me
keep on track for my goals I do find
they help supplement my diet and also
support my overall health and that's why
I think it's really important and I'm
gonna talk a bit about it before I get
into my workout routine so yeah they
should not take long but keep on
watching I'm so weird so the reason why
I do believe in Nature's Way over other
things is that they are a really rich
brown with a lot of history and where I
live it's very hard to find specific
herbal supplements and if I do I would
never really know what's in them and
that's the thing that makes me a little
bit skeptical is sometimes I think
something is good so I start taking it
and then after figuring out all what all
those words are
like I don't know what any of these
chemicals or whatever this means so I
get a little bit nervous they are also
the first herbal brand to be non-gmo
project verified and have the true ID
certifications basically what that just
means is that we know that whatever
ingredients are on the labels match
what's in the products and I think
that's like the most important thing to
stress because again I'm trying to be
well aware of what is going inside my
body they're easy for traveling on the
go you can kind of just throw them on
your purse on your bag or if you travel
a lot like me it's really good to have
that kind of on me especially because I
do have like indigestion I get kind of
but upset stomachs when I am traveling
you guys also know I have been
vegetarian for two full years now how's
it been two years yeah it's been two
years and I find a lot of their products
fit easily into that lifestyle so that's
really good they have gluten-free
options
I'll show you guys like which things I
use and like what they're for okay so
for example when it comes to ingestion
ginger ooh sometimes I get nauseous when
I'm traveling and I don't know why hi
boo I have sometimes like stomach issues
and this helps so much with relieving
that I just would make sure to have this
with a full glass of water so that you
can avoid heartburn so this is I don't
know how to pronounce this I think it's
Curie kheh Kirika tumeric and I don't
know if you guys have been hearing but
turmeric has been like what everyone's
talking about lately um you guys know
that I work out almost seven days a week
you know and like I kind of am intense
when it comes to fitness and sometimes I
do get muscle pain I get joint pain and
this helps a lot with that another way
to have turmeric is like this tumeric
powder you guys know I add like a pinch
of this to like everything I make if you
watch any of my what I ate today I add
like in my soups and my Chili's can mix
it into like your favorite drink
whatever it is I have to americon a
daily basis and I really do believe it
helps a ton when it comes to my overall
health Cayenne garlic really helps aid
in circulatory health and that just
means like your basically your blood
flow so from like your heart throughout
your veins and the last thing I want to
talk about is this this is aloe vera
this is just pure leaf juice I mix this
into my smoothies in the morning and it
just really helps improve my overall
wellness oh my gosh and I will have all
links listed down below for you guys to
check out now that I'm done talking
about my health
let's get into the actual fitness so I
asked you guys on Instagram on my
stories what kind of thing you want to
see for my fitness video I had like a
little poll on my stories and it was
like 79 percent or something wanted me
to include clips so that's what I'm
gonna do
by the way you guys should follow me on
instagram cuz I'm gonna start doing that
more like asking you guys which videos
you want to see for like which days and
like what you want to see and I've been
asking a ton of help with like certain
things I should pack and I've been a lot
more active on my stories lately and I
think that's a lot of fun because I get
like instant feedback from you guys so
what I'll do is I'll insert some clips a
sister actually helped me film this and
it was really hard because there are
people there and I was trying so hard
not to get people in it I always do
cardio no matter what usually it's 40
minutes of cardio but whether that be on
the elliptical the bike the Stairmaster
in the summer when the weather's nice I
love to run outside I love to go for
hikes I love to be active that way you
guys can totally just like take that as
you will like you do not have to do 40
minutes of cardio at all that's just the
level that I'm at right now but I would
say if you're new to it maybe do like
five to ten minutes of cardio just like
jump rope or do jumping jacks or get
your heart rate up cuz I think that's
important for us warm up before you do
any kind of like strength training so
I'm gonna have a few links down below to
some of my favorite workouts that are
like 10 to 15 sometimes 20 minutes long
there's this one channel that I love to
follow along because it's strictly I
just like put my phone down I lie on a
mat and I just do everything that they
say and I'm sweating by the end my butt
is so sore but I love that feeling
because it means that I just like worked
really hard so I'm gonna have some links
down below for you guys to check out
specific videos that I do and then if
you guys do them please let me know what
you think like either on Instagram you
can tweet me you can comment down below
DME whatever let me know how you feel if
you do it and then also make sure you do
a cool-down stretching I like to do
stretching exercises I'll have a link
down below for some of my favorite
stretches to do but really stretch out
the muscles that you were working that
day and also another thing I want to
stress is I don't do the same thing
every day and I switch up with body
parts I'm doing so yesterday I did like
butt and like legs a lot of legs so then
today I'm doing like arms and then
tomorrow I'll do back and then the day
after I'll do abs I really like to
spread it out because that way you give
your
other muscles a time the time a chance
to heal in between when you're doing
like your main exercise make sure you're
doing it properly so I mean your form so
really try to look at what the person on
the screen is doing obviously they'll
try to explain it but sometimes I've
noticed like even though someone is
explaining something and I think I'm
doing it for example when I was filming
this and I looked back at the clips when
I got home I was like oh my gosh my form
was so bad and that's why I like do not
follow like my form in these clips like
it was just horrible making sure that
you're like Korres always tight your
breathing properly and that's really why
I like these videos this is not
sponsored by them at all I just really
like their channel and I like to follow
along my goals for this year and I'm
gonna make a lot more videos about it
really tone out my butt I do have some
cellulite and I know that's normal and
there's nothing wrong with that and like
most women have cellulite but I really
want to kind of like minimize it I know
a lot of that has to do with diet as
well trying to like build muscle on my
butt reduce fat as well as tone out my
thighs it's the same thing I really want
to like build muscle reduce that I'm not
trying to have like skinny thighs or
anything I just want them to be like fit
and tight
really good
go down
and then the same thing with like my abs
I have really nice top ABS right under
my bellybutton is that little like pouch
and I really want to again tighten up my
underneath abs and really focus on that
kind of area and then as well as like I
have pretty good muscles in my arms like
I think it's they're pretty good but
again like back here a little bit I
think I would like to tighten up so my
goal is kind of like tighten everything
up make it a lot more firm really work
hard at the gym and I'm definitely going
to be documenting it in like a series so
what I'll do is my next upcoming videos
if you guys want I can like take
pictures I can fill them I could show
and see exactly what I'm doing and you
guys can follow along if you want to
like grow your booty or anything like
that I think it would be fun to do it
together let me know what you guys think
I hope this video could help in some way
it's not a full workout routine again

out I will have exactly what I do with
links down below please go follow along
