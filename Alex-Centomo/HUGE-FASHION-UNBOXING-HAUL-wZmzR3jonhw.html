channel I recently have been doing so
much shopping which whatever what else
is new I don't know I honestly don't
know how to start these haul videos
because I just feel so bad I'm always
like I did shopping here's what I got
but seriously I recently sat down and
walked I don't remember who it was but
somebody did an unboxing haul and I
remember feeling like oh my gosh I love
that it's so interesting for me because
I love getting packages in the mail and
like opening them up and seeing what I
get it's like Christmas but then also
seeing what other people get and their
first reactions on it I think we're
really interesting so I really want to
do that just a warning
this is not a try on haul because
literally the first time I'm seeing
these items they're all in huge boxes of
stuff so I'm going to be opening them up
and I guess showing you guys the stuff
that I got as well as my first time
seeing it because sometimes things look
different online than doing them than
they do in person and also a lot of
these things I ordered a long time ago
because I live in Canada and shipping
even though it's Express is sometimes
could take up to two weeks because of
customs like if the package gets stuck
at the border so a lot of these things I
don't even remember what I got so that's
gonna be fun and surprising and I wish I
was wearing my glasses I really wonder
if these are going to be super
reflective you know what I'm just going
to wear them I'm sorry if you see the
reflection of the window but I could see
better and I'm curious okay so this
first package I'm trying not to show
like my address because obviously it's
all over the package um this is from oh
this is from adore me oh my gosh I'm so
excited so I placed a huge order off
adore me for workout clothes and some
like lingerie you guys don't know what
adore me is it's actually a website that
it's like a subscription website and
there's a VIP membership
I think it's thirty nine ninety five oh
they're in boxes oh my gosh look how
pretty that is
wow dude packaging is key okay so this
is the website WWE pom so when you sign
up you actually get your
set for 29 24 95 I believe but for the
monthly subscription it's 39.95 and you
get to choose a matching set from the
months that month's collection we also
have the possibility to skip that month
and that month's charge Oh guys look how
pretty that is
seriously though oh my gosh oh it's like
packaged up pretty okay a lot of times
you'll probably seen the future ones I'm
used to packages like you'll see oh my
gosh
oh my gosh legit so oh yeah okay I got a
bunch of underwear because literally I'm
out of like all my underwear and I want
to keep thing comfy I also got the I
forgot um like a pajama set you'll see
I'm going to open it all up actually and
what's great about adore me is that they
offer free shipping and free exchanges
which is key and since I'm new to this
the first set is 24.95 instead of ooh
39.95 so that's great and oh my gosh I'm
so excited for this okay so I got this
pajama set this oh my god this is the
softest material so it's the long-sleeve
shirt definitely bringing this on my
trip because I'm going somewhere very
cold and I know I'm gonna freeze all the
matching bottoms cute their pads oh
these look comfy okay so these things
I'm so excited this is going to be a
really long video I'm just letting you
know if you do not like long videos and
if you're not curious about what people
get when they go shopping then go watch
this
but I'm very nosy so I would like it
Oh cute wow this looks really big though
okay I got in a size medium because all
of my underwear normally size small but
this looks really big oh maybe not but
it's like oh my god this is the softest
lace holy crap I have a big booty so I
need things to cover properly
and that was the struggle with my other
thing okay so I got fat and black I got
it in white and then this pink and black
color oh yeah oh look how nice this is
guys how pretty I love this color
oh my gosh the back is super low as well
oh this is so nice I'm so excited to use
this so this is a size medium for those
of you that are wondering about the
matching bottoms and the same thing and
white so on to the next box there's two
other boxes in here again the packaging
is just like love you know it's like
havel with care when it looks super nice
okay this is nice as well oh I didn't
see this but here it says adorn verb to
love and respect someone deeply that's
so cute okay this is all my workout
stuff well I'm so excited for this
workout bra love this the back is like
mesh oh the insides super green there's
a nice cup inside got a size medium yeah
the matching bottoms are here oh nice so
these are three I think this goes down
to like mid calf and there's some mesh
details over here I don't I don't know
if you can see that that's so nice and
it has the same pattern on the back and
on the top I get really inspired when I
get workout stuff because then I just
really feel like going to the gym other
paths all ooh these are nice oh I really
like these the quality is amazing by the
way this is the same as the other one
just completely black inside is like a
bright coral so pretty is this
reversible no it's not still love the
cut of this love oh yeah last thing in
this box so they have a nice like cool
floral detail the top they're black but
they're kind of like really soft
material and then they have these
cutouts on the leg part here which is
really nice I like things with subtle
detail
pijama oh it's like the short set okay
so I got the pads and I also got the
shorts really cute and this is a t-shirt
instead of a long-sleeve shirt oh so
soft oh my gosh guys I wish you could

that listed in the description on to the
next I did an order off for over 21
because most of you guys know this but
forever 21 has like the best stuff
online and I just like don't like going
into the store because it's hectic and
it stresses me out oh I love this color
do you guys like ever do this when you
get new things whether it's online or in
a store you go home and you try on all
the new stuff in front of a mirror and
just like listen to music and try out
outfits and just like either dance or
just look at yourself
that sounds so bad but I do that
hopefully not the only one this is cute
okay so this is a super long sleeve
really soft like cardigan material
sweater knit and it's high-neck which I
really like I love this color with
leggings and like boots so nice and the
back has these buttons that go all the
way down and is a little open next
is oh yay I remember this I got a hoodie
do this materials the same material it's
so soft look at this color guys so this
is a really actually this is a lot
thinner than I thought it was gonna be
hmm not sure how I feel about that but
still it's really cute really soft I'll
see I'll try not if I don't love it I'll
return it but I love the color and you
guys know me with hoodie it's soft and
like squishy you know when you get new
socks and they have like that squishy I
don't know if I make any sense but I
know what I'm talking about it makes
sense in my brain okay then the last
thing I got I think I only got three
things forever so you want to mean by
packaging though how is just like in a
bag so it's still nice but it's like
okay this is nice this is like a cream
color cropped knit with like these ties
on the side that's pretty oh my gosh I
love this next I did shopping off of
revolve you guys know revolve is like my
absolute favorite website this doesn't
show my address but I've been shopping
there for a very long time and I love
their stuff first thing is a sweater
what do you guys know is it a gray
sweater isn't it fall shopping gets me
excited for the cold weather
I'm just saying oh that's a nice
turtleneck and it's great I love it okay
this is from the brand lovers and
friends I believe yep
size large of course nice oversized got
such a nice turtleneck oh and it's going
to be a little loose that's so pretty
wow this is so nice what amazing
material like I really like when
turtlenecks and sweaters have really
thick sleeves like wide that's nice and
it's not too long so I can wear this
with jeans and I look really cute I'm
already picturing this now with like
some kind of mom jeans and some loafers
or some really nice um booties like
black booties oh I love then I think I
got the same exact thing in a different
color because I remember online not
being able to choose between the two I'm
thinking okay I'll get both and I'll see
oh yeah I know I'm so glad I got both
cuz I love them both oh my god this
color how nice is this
it's exact same sweater just a different
color oh my gosh see I always thought
this color would look better on
brunettes but every time I see somebody
wearing it that's blonde I always think
I should just go for it it's still so
nice guys I love it okay that's just a
return thing if I wanted to return it
then I got a jacket like a bomber jacket
and this is from lovers and friends
again oh nice oh yeah it's this one oh
look at this guys it's like a satin
looking bomber it's pink and black and
look at the back how sweet is that
that's nice okay
officially sold buy it Tularosa from
revolve as well and this is a faux fur
jacket I have always wanted something
like this what is that oh it's one of
these things huh Oh oh my gosh oh this
is so so what is this made out of it's
not real I know it says folk oh my god
that sheds though
oh that's flying everywhere okay that's
all over the couch but worth it this is
so soft oh my gosh I'm wearing this on
the plane I'm wearing this 100 million
percent on the plane I think guys don't
know I'm going to Saskatoon to visit
friends for Halloween they my friends I
have two kids um if you follow my blogs
and everything you'll know them
um it's cold there so I'm gonna need to
be bundled up in sweaters and scarves
and hats and boots and nice faux fur
jackets this is so comfy I think this is
my favorite thing then I got an order
off free people because I wanted a hat
and then I saw a necklace so I got the
necklace and then I saw shirt so I got a
shirt first thing is this hat I don't
know how I feel about this
again it's faux but I don't know it
looked way cooler online what do you
guys think its really soft though then
for jewelry I got okay oh you have this
little choker look at this it's like a
tiny little rose gold rose gold choker
with like a plastic black what is this
thing called like this horn thing oh
that's cute I like that and then my fav
is this velvet dress shirt how frickin
cool is this this isn't a size medium
this is nice like I said here wide
sleeves they're not all I think they
like three-quarter length really pretty
velvet is like sewing right now but I'm
all about it I think it's so nice they
last two things I picked up in the store
but I have yet to even like try them on
look at them whatever so the first one
is this timberlands because like I said
I'm going to Saskatoon I needed a warm
boot they're just the classic ones I
want to be like light grey ones but they
only have them in men's so I needed
boots for this weekend I got these ones
they're so nice I'm thinking these with
leggings and this faux fur jacket and a
scarf then the last place I went was
brandy melville so this stuff I haven't
even tried on yet I just grabbed it's a
really liked it this top I actually
owned last year and I lost it so I just
got this again is it to sleep in it's
really cute but I like the orange like
high-neck and then the like little
stripes it's like vintage looking but I
really like
comfy then I got this cropped tee that
says Colorado because I'm actually going
to Colorado really soon so I was
planning on just like taking a picture
in this plus I just thought the tea was
really cool as it is this I really like
it's like a cropped thin sweater like
thermal it has that waffle material and
it's loose and flowy and I think this
was like a big chunky scarf would be
really cute and some denim jeans maybe a
leather jacket on top really good for
layering and the last thing I got was
this maroon sweater looks like this it's
a simple crewneck sweater maroon I
didn't have anything like this before
and I was thinking of bringing this to
Saskatoon because it's red and I was
thinking of doing like a Canadian
picture I don't know I'm from Canada so
sometimes I don't whatever I'm not
making sense but it's really cute and I
like it a lot this video is probably so
long I'm so sorry but I'm so excited
over all these purchases I these are
things that have been coming in the mail
