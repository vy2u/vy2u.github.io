channel Spring has finally sprung I am
so excited the weather is finally
getting warmer here in Montreal there's
still snow outside but the Sun is hot
and the snow is melting and I'm really
really excited about it so finally I
feel appropriate enough to film this
walk so finally I feel good enough to
film this video for you guys it has been
requested for so long and I've been
putting it off because I'm like I'm so
not in the spring vibe because of the
freezing cold weather but it's getting
warm also I'd like to say please ignore
my eyebrows right now your girls getting
them threaded next week so yeah so that
further adieu I'm just gonna hop right
into the video because my intros are
always like forever the first place I
went to obviously was Brandi you guys
know I love Brandi I just want to point
out really quickly that yes I'm in my
closet room right now because it's sunny
outside for once and there's like Sun
patches everywhere my house is the only
place I could find Brandi got some
goodies there's a lot of stuff in here
so I'm gonna go through it real quick
some spring some transitioning from
winter to spring some more summery
pieces and yeah I got a ton of questions
about this sweater on my vlog Channel
and this is from Brandi it's really
awesome I don't know what it is about
like car racing this year but that's
like totally on trend right now I see
like all these vintage racecar jackets
that people are wearing like this shirt
that I got from Bamba Swim is about race
cars and like everything is about like
race cars so but I relate the color of
this so that's why I got this it's
really comfy now on to the more springy
items well maybe not so much Montreal
spring but like spring everywhere else
in the world so tube tops have been in
for a while now but I have been seeing
them like crazy lately and this one is
so cute I love the color of it the only
downside to these is because I have
broader shoulders and like I'm more
broad around like where the bra strap
goes it doesn't stay up properly my
friends that are more narrow this stays
up on them so well and maybe it's cuz I
don't wear a bra maybe I should wear a
bra cousin I would stay above the bra
but I usually just like wear this
without a bra because I think it's cute
and I like that look but I really like
this color a lot and I cannot wait to
wear this one I have a tan because yeah
that's like no thing right
even though myself tend it like did not
show at all then this crop top is so
cute I'm thinking of bringing this to LA
because I'm leaving for Coachella very
soon and I know a lot of you guys have
asked me to come out with a Coachella
haul maybe I'll do something like that
you guys let me know or like not even
Coachella just like Festival Hall things
that I am like loving for festival
season this year let me know but this is
really cute I love it ties in the front
cuter if you have smaller boobs because
it's like less revealing but I still say
if you got boobs rocket doesn't really
matter I'm all for that I don't have the
smallest boobs and I still wear tops
like this I don't really care like if
you're gonna judge me for that then like
that's on you because like it doesn't
bother me when I see that and then this
is black so not very spring color theme
but the top is really cute it's buttoned
all the way down and I thought this
would be so nice with high-waisted jeans
that are like very light washed and the
90s fit jeans so they're like straight
leg I actually ordered a pair online but
they're probably only gonna get here in
a week so because Canada but I thought
it would be so cute so maybe I'll do
like a spring lookbook and show you
exactly what I'm talking about
it's like high-waisted straight legs Doc
Martens this and chokers which by the
way I'm wearing two of my chokers from
louwman cattle if you guys are
interested in getting them I'll have a
link listed down below these are the
necklaces that I designed they come in
silver gold and rose gold am wearing the
rose gold ones today and I get questions
about them all the time I always period
to tell you about them but I'll have
them linked down below and I'm probably
be doing a giveaway soon so stay tuned
for that another crop top this one is
really cool again it's going around
along the whole trend of the race car
thing so it has like stripes on the side
which reminds me of adidas but I really
like this I think I want to wear this
too in LA another one this one is red
and white so this is actually really
similar to the top I'm wearing now like
color wise but red and white is
everywhere right now
so I really like this a lot and it goes
well with this type of denim I'm not
saying sizes because brandies one size
but the Pharos say the price of the
other tops but this one says $22
Canadian which is 18 USD then I saw this
top in the store and I absolutely loved
it the only thing is I don't think I
love it on me so I might return it if
you guys have like a smaller frame like
smaller shoulders I think would look
so cute how nice is this I love stripes
I love Navy I love white and there's
like a black stripe in there too it's
really really cute it's a very stretchy
material but I feel like it's very like
stretched on my arms but I'll see I'm
like thinking about it right now but so
far like I love the top on its own just
not sure how I feel about it on me this
is another option I'm bringing for LA
because I just love really really
cropped tops with super high-waisted
jeans and like some kind of jacket
thrown over so this it looks like right
on camera but it's actually really
really pale pink or like a pale peachy
pink it has in the back this like
stretchy part and this actually reminds
me of like shirts that I used to wear
when I was a kid then I got three things
from Windsor the first one being this
top that I wore in an Instagram post
right here and so many of you guys asked
me where the top was from even though I
like tagged it in the picture under the
caption always make sure to read my
caption guys because I most of the time
talk about like a statement piece in my
picture of like what I'm wearing but
it's from Windsor I love the colors it's
long sleeves it's a little cropped but
it's very very thin so it's very
breathable I don't feel hot when I wear
it and I think it's a very good
transition top if it's not too warm
where you live and it's kind of
transitioning from winter this is
perfect then this top I was trying to
take a picture in it for so long and it
was just freezing cold so I was like I'm
just gonna give up and wear this like
when I go to LA or something but I love
it look at this okay so it definitely
has a lot of cleavage going on
especially for me but I love the way it
looks I think this is so cute for
layering and I love the colors I don't
know the sizes for those too cuz I've
worn them so I don't have a tag on it
but this is a size small and it's 20 for
90 US dollars so it looks like this it's
like a fondo top I say bondo cuz I'm
French I know a lot of you guys say I'm
saying it wrong but it's actually a
French word and you say bondo in French
but how do I have to I show this I mean
you'll see it in the Tryon but it's
basically like it looks like a ribbon
right now so you'll just see it in the
Tryon it's really cute it's super
cropped and I'm gonna wear it with
high-waisted jeans and like a jacket to
throw over and I love the pattern and
then the next place I got some stuff is
Princess Paul you guys know I am the big
saina princess Polly I do have a promo
code for you guys if you want 20% off of
princess Polly so I'll have that listed
in the description remember what it is
but I'll be there I always get DMS from
you guys on Instagram asking if I have
promo codes and I always forget to like
mention them because I just put them in
my description but there is one for
princess Paul if you guys are curious
and as for customs and stuff I typically
don't pay customs but like it's a hit or
miss and you never really know if you're
gonna get customs or not depends where
you live depends how much you're
ordering what you're ordering like
there's so many things if you're from
Canada then like I really I don't know
but the first top is my absolute
favorite how cute is this it's cropped
it's long-sleeve it's off the shoulder
it has like these little frills and I
love the black and white stripes it's so
nice like picture this I should have
worn this anyways whatever it's really
really cute high-waisted jeans of course
this top is also really cute but I feel
like it doesn't fit my chest properly
like the blind goes in the middle of my
boobs I don't know how I feel about it
but oh and the other top doesn't have a
tag because I've worn it this one has a
tag it is yeah okay so this is what's
confusing I got a size 12 Australian
which is normally like a size large just
because I never know how these tops are
gonna fit and it still doesn't fit my
boobs like I swear this is made for
girls with like tiny tiny boobs but it's
still so cute so I'm gonna find a way to
make it work because like when it's on
and it fits properly it's so nice but as
soon as I move like though both seem
goes to the middle of my boobs but like
I don't really care cuz it's such a cute
top it's so comfortable to like the
material is really nice and there's no
price tag on this then this top I've
worn as well I think actually this is my
pair top scratch what I said before
look at this is so 90s like this is
something I would have seen like Sabrina
the Teenage Witch wearing and I would
have been obsessed with it or like one
of the girls I'm charmed I was obsessed
with those charms when I was young I
love so it's a really cute pink color it
has skinny spaghetti straps it's a crop
I don't know the size or the price but
it's a size medium it's really cute I
probably could have gone to the size
small cuz it's a little on the loose
side but I never know what tops cuz you
know I got size large before my boobs
didn't fit so it's a hit-or-miss
okay this top is gonna be really hard to
show on camera so your guys you're gonna
see it on the Tryon but it's basically
this is the material and it wraps around
your body off the shoulders it has these
poofy sleeves and then it ties in the
front this looks
so confusing but it's so cute on and I'm
going somewhere in May and I'm gonna be
bringing this because it suits the vibe
perfectly um I'm not gonna say where I'm
going yet but hint hint it's for my
Bachelorette we are traveling somewhere
really fun with my wedding party then I
got these shorts which are gonna be kind
of confusing to show because there's
like the string that ties around but
basically this is just like a belt so
ignore this for right now you'll see it
on a Tryon and this is a size 10 there's
no price tag on it but they're
high-waisted shorts that are like
material and I thought this would just
be good even with a pink top that I just
showed you something really easy to kind
of throw on that are lightweight that
aren't gene but switch up the look a
little bit I got this in a white color
and a like army green then I got these
pens from IMG a-- which are crazy but
they're from pines' poly but they're
bred the brand I am Jia they have this
like these are funky like I don't even
know how me to wear these they're our
size oh there's no size on it I think I
got a medium oh no I got a size small
they're high-waisted they're checkered
they go in at the ankles
they're super funky and out there but
I'm gonna see if I can rock them and if
I can't then whatever but I thought they
were cute then I got this hot princess
Polly has the best hats look how cute
this is I think this is by brixton yes I
small they have sizes guys so if you're
curious about that I'm a size small I'm
a very small head extra small is too
small but if you think of a smaller head
than I do get an extra small then this
just reminds me of my childhood like
these colors
so something like my mom would have worn
in the 90s I really like it I'm a size
medium no price tag high-waisted black
jeans and then the last thing again no
price tag but size medium another red
top it's a t-shirt it's really cute it's
super red and I love it and it's really
flimsy and really soft as you can tell
I'm really liking the red but I hope you
