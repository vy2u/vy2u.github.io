over
hey guys what's up I am here today
filming my haircare tutorial this has
been so requested I don't know why I
haven't done it before I think it's cuz
um in my other hair tutorial videos I
kind of like briefly explain what I do
with my hair but I figured I would just
explain it all in one video get it all
over with get so many questions in my
comments on Instagram of how I grow up
my hair so fast and you know tips and
tricks of growing your hair and what I
do to keep my hair healthy and all that
kind of stuff so without further ado
let's get started there's a fly in my
room oh my gosh this is gonna drive me
insane I have tried to film this video
so many times and something always goes
wrong the other day filmed it outside
and it was like perfectly fine I really
liked it and then I edited the whole
thing I exported it and then when I went
to watch it there was no volume and I
don't understand why and I don't know
what I'm doing but basically this is the
third time I'm trying to film this video
so hopefully this works
uh-huh as you can see my room is a mess
I'm sorry I'm just I woke up I just I'm
to film this and I hope you guys can
understand that anyways I don't know why
I'm doing this this is like weird sure
was journal for the products that I use
in the shower I guess it's a good idea a
lot of people ask me what shampoo and
conditioner is so I figured might be a
good idea to show you guys so for
shampoo lately I like to switch up my
shampoo a lot actually
but for the summer time I've been really
enjoying this shampoo bar it's from lush
and it's called the scenic shampoo bar I
believe um smells really good I hauled
this last summer actually not this exact
one but I hauled this product last
summer and my like mini lush haul I got
a sample version of this and it lasted
me like a month and a half and it was so
tiny so I'm sure this is gonna last me a
long time I love using this in the
summertime just because it smells like
the ocean it smells so good it's like a
mixture of coconut and sea salt and
there's like little seaweeds in it it's
super super cute and it just smells so
freakin amazing oh my gosh I wish you
guys could smell this right now but
basically what I do with this is once
again the shower I will rinse my hair
and then I'll lather this up in my hands
and then I will rub it and massage it
into my roots no I never you shampoo in
the ends of my hair just because I find
it very drying and when I used to go to
the hairdresser they used to actually
only wash my roots and they explained to
me that that is actually the proper way
to use shampoo so you just wash your
roots because when you're rinsing out
the shampoo it goes down and touches the
rest of your hair so to wash the rest of
your hair you don't want to concentrate
the shampoo on the ends of your hair
because it's just gonna completely
damage it and break it and really dry it
out where you really want to get rid of
the grease on the roots so I will
actually wash my hair once rinse it out
and then wash it a second time and this
I find like I've been doing it since
last summer and I really find that since
then my hair has been so volumizing you
will notice especially with this product
that when you wash your hair the second
time it just creates so much volume and
it just love yourself like crazy and I
just love doing it now so I'll actually
start off by washing the back of my hair
underneath and then I'll work my way to
the top and I think that just creates
the most volume and and yeah that's
about it so that's what I do for shampoo
next from lush again I use this
conditioner bar so I've been really
loving the like shampoo conditioner bars
lately the solids I just really like it
especially for the summer time I don't
know why um but basically this looks
like a block of cheese but I promise you
it is not it smells really good it's
actually the big conditioner so if you
know they're they have like a big
shampoo and big conditioner and the big
shampoo is usually like a sea salt
coconut mixture but this is the solid
conditioner bar and what I like to do is
I cut off little pieces before I get in
the shower and then I'll just massage it
into the ends of my hair so I'll break
off a little piece and I'll mix it like
this in my hands and then massage it
into the ends of my hair and I'll let it
sit and the reason why I like to let the
conditioner sit in my hair is because I
just like I just think in my head that
it like absorbs everything into like the
root of the hair not the root cuz that's
the root but like you know what I mean
like I just like picture if the
conditioner sitting in there for like a
couple minutes then like it's just
absorbing everything and making it
healthier and less dry so I'll focus it
from like my ears down
then I'll let it sit and I'll do
everything else in the showers so like
wash my face Shea wash my body and then
the last thing I do in the shower is
rinse out the conditioner so that's
basically what I do in the shower
also I wash my hair every I don't know
three to four days probably more than
like the fourth day just because I can
go for days without washing my hair and
without looking greasy I love to use dry
shampoo I've been using different dry
shampoos I don't I recommend all of them
the only one I don't recommend though is
the Tresemme one because it's it's not
the greatest but um every like third
wash I guess I will switch up my shampoo
and conditioner just to give my hair a
break from the same product so I
normally use whatever is in my shower at
the time so I mean right now it's like
the mane and tail shampoo and then like
our Herbal Essences conditioner or
something just ride them to switch it up
a little bit because I find when I get
into the same routine for a long time my
hair kind of gets used to the product
and it doesn't work as well but when I
break it up I find like every time I go
back to these products from lush it like
works amazingly so that's just what I've
been doing since last summer now when I
get out of the shower the first thing I
do is comb out my hair so I will use a
wide tooth comb this is disgusting hold
on a second I only use a wide tooth comb
this one I showed in many tutorials
before you I just find the white tooth
comb is less damaging on your hair I
recommend not using a brush when your
hair is wet because it does break your
ends
so why tooth comb is great but before I
comb out my hair I'll actually spray
some of this into it and this is the
it's a 10 miracle leave-in product I
have the keratin one as well I just
purchased because this one is empty now
but I like to spray this from like my
ears down on my ends and let it sit for
like a minute and then I use this to
comb it out and I usually start from
like the bottom of my hair and I'll work
my way slowly up so that way I can like
work on the knots individually and I
just find that's like less damaging on
my hair and then this is great because
it's like a really good detangler and
stuff so I just really recommend this
product and then when my hair is like
somewhat dry like I'd say maybe like 80%
dry I will come in with this now this is
the Moroccan oil it is the light version
because I have blonde hair I don't know
the girl just recommended me getting
lighter version I don't remember the
reason why I think it's because the dark
one can kind of tint the hair I don't
know but anyways I used like around two
pumps of this in my hands and then I'll
just rub it together and I'll focus it
on the ends of my hair and kind of just
like bring it through and then I'll comb
it out one more time and whatever excess
I have if I have any I'll like rub it on
my elbows or any dry area like my hands
or whatever because I find it's really
good on skin too so then I let it air
dry
I never blow dry my hair I don't
remember the last time I blow dry my
hair I love my hair when it's air dried
so and because I do that stuff with the
shampoo it's I find it very volumize now
on to tips to growing out your hair so I
find it extremely important to not use
heat I know this is like kind of weird
because I do a lot of hair tutorials
using heat but I really don't use heat
on my hair that often I don't think I've
used heat in the past two months I don't
know if you guys have noticed in my
Instagram I've been like doing fish
tails and like letting my hair be
natural my pictures and doing like
regular braids and stuff just because
I've been trying to go a long time
without putting heat in my hair I'd like
to take breaks because I used to do my
hair all the time I used to always
strain my hair I used to do the like the
curls and stuff and no matter what heat
protectant I was using it was just
breaking and so last summer I decided
okay I'm going to go the whole summer
without ever doing my hair with heat not
once and it grew out so much I was so
surprised so then I decided okay
throughout this year I will see if I can
go a long time without putting heat my
hair obviously for some photo shoots and
for some specific like videos or
pictures I had to do it but that was
literally like once every couple weeks
it really wasn't much at all and then
the second point I have is to not dye
your hair as much I know that sucks cuz
a lot of people don't like their natural
hair color but I used to hate my natural
hair color I used to dye my hair like so
blonde dates to bleach the whole thing
it was so gross it wouldn't want to get
me started in that but um my hair was
like up to here and it was super blond
and it was just breaking and I would get
regular trims and it was just getting
shorter and shorter and shorter and I
did understand why and I was like
straightening it too and so last summer
I was like you know what the ombre trend
is in let me just grow up my roots and
happens and I have been loving it my
hair is growing so much as you can see
this is like all my natural hair color
and then it goes back down into the
blonde but like look my like look at
this difference it's crazy
my hair has grown so much and I just
I'm loving the natural hair look on you
right now I'm probably always going to
keep some blonde in there I'm not really
sure yet I don't know but I just really
like the way my natural hair is looking
I really like this whole ombre thing
it's very different and I cannot be
happier with my hair those are like the
two main points I have obviously there's
the whole thing with the trimming but I
hear two different sides of the story I
know the hairdresser says you need to
get like regular trims because you don't
want your split ends to rise up I know
that's true but you don't have to get
trims as often as they say I know
Katherine and Karina get trims around
like once every couple months and they
literally take off like this much it's
not a lot at all and their hair is like
crazy long so I mean trim your dead ends
once in a while but you don't have to do
it every like three weeks or whatever
the hairdresser's say I forget but I
know I kind of trim it I usually just do
myself but I do it like every like six
months 6-8 months or whatever and it's
working fine for me just get off the
dead ends so I hope you guys enjoyed
this video I know it's like probably a
pretty short actually I don't know if
this is going to be a short video not
sometimes I like to ramble but let me
know in the comments below if you have
any other suggestions for videos I might
want to do kind of like a no heat hair

that in the past and I know that's like
there's so many hairstyles you can do
without using heat and it's summertime

hair there's no reason for it let's try
