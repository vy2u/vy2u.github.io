in a bun can you believe it my hair is
never up if you guys don't already know
if you don't watch my blogging channel
or anything like that then you probably
don't know that I have been really
trying to change my diet over the past
few months I've been eating very very
healthy and when it comes with traveling
a lot it's kind of hard to stick to a
specific diet because not that I'm like
on a diet but I do try and eat very
healthy but with traveling is hard
because you're constantly eating out and
stuff but when i'm back home i really
try and focus on keeping my diet a
certain way so what i think is best for
most people and what I really enjoy
doing is eating kind of like smaller
meals throughout the day and like
snacking off in so that way not that
you're eating like huge amounts but
you're snacking you're never kind of
depriving yourself of anything so you
never feel like you need to binge like
that one cheat day that you have and
just eat a bunch of crap because you're
like we're so so super healthy I'm the
rest of the days of the week so I just
think that works best for me because
then that way I never really crave
anything and I'm able to kind of keep my
diet in check plus eating constantly
throughout the day does help with your
metabolism it does speed it up I'm not
saying to eat like five Big Macs a day
you know I mean like obviously keep your
meals somewhat healthy I do make what I
eat in a day videos and I do kind of
talk about a lot of my blogging channel
but this is something i do want to start
incorporating a lot into my main channel
because i get so many of you guys ask me
questions about my diet my exercise
routine how to stay fit how to stay
healthy how to stay motivated and there
is just so many things i want to talk
about so today what I'm going to talk
about is something that I discovered
recently that is kind of going along
with my diet and kind of going along
with snacking so if you guys don't know
I eat like three main meals a day plus
two snacks in between each male so I
want to talk about this thing right here
called braids this is a subscription box
service for healthy snacks and i
discovered this because who was i'm
watching the talk about this i forget
but somebody on youtube mentioned this
company and i was like oh my god wait
was it she car
no I don't remember who it was but um
basically I am always looking for
healthy snacks because i love snacking
let's be real I love the sack there
aren't that many great things where I'm
from I feel like if you don't live in LA
they don't have the best packing
services but this thing makes up for it
big time so it's they have 100 different
healthy snacks basically what i'm going
to do is I'm going to show you guys what
came this month and I'm going to try to
so you get this box you open it up and
you get a card inside that shows
everything what they are what the
ingredients are um how they're good for
you it literally shows the nutrition
facts on the back right here which is
really good so it tells you exactly what
the ingredients are how much is in
everything and then the package itself
so these are some snacks oh my god is
look so good the only thing is is that
because I'm gluten intolerant I can't
eat everything but there are three other
people in my household that are not
gluten intolerant so they take the other
versions but I'm definitely gonna show
you guys what I love about it oh these
looks so good this is a strawberry
cheesecake so I don't think I can eat
the cookie part but I definitely can eat
the dried strawberries and chocolate hmm
holy crap that's good I'm you can see in
this little box it's small so it's not
like you're gonna eat a crazy melis look
perfect for snacking I'm literally going
to open every single and I'm doing my
sister try the other ones spicy sriracha
crunch like this mmm they're like little
dried corn oh my god literally tastes
like cute Cheetos wow that's good oh and
by the way there's two layers now I'm
going on to the second layer of triple
berry smoothie package so inside there
seems to be dried bananas dried oh
there's three different berries all mmm
my mom is literally Jason candy okay
guys so it's significantly later now but
I wanted to bring dial to my video
because I'm I wanted him to try out the
ones I couldn't eat because since I am
gluten intolerance there are ones i
can't but i live at home still so like
everyone can enjoy them and my sister
would not try them on camera but she
really really likes them so these ones
are called like mini bagel bites they're
like an everything bagel yeah so every
like everything bagel has a poppy seed
onion and sesame seed on it I don't know
it's really popular here in Montreal I
love it it's my favorite kind and so I
try it good
it's got that nice like roasted onion
flavor yeah this is a snickerdoodle dip
so you got like sticks and then some
kind of dip that you dip it in with a
snickerdoodle I don't know but it says
it's pretzel sticks with cinnamon don't
oh okay so you know pretzel sticks of
cinnamon dip I don't know how to be able
to eat that but that's good okay this
one I'm really jealous about it's a mini
bread basket so there's like baguette
bread there's like kurt on looking
things oh that smells really good I'll
try this one and this one was like a
bunch of different ones mmhmm yeah I'd
taste like a good crew Tom I like I like
a smoothie one like little mini
strawberries oh good too so you got wild
blueberry toast and a little bit of
white chocolate which I'm gonna
definitely get my bedroom oh yeah I love
white chocolate
hmm touch my favorite this is not part
of the box guys he's Lola's true she's
just chillin on my bed so what's really
great about these snacks is that there's
zero trans fat they're really actually
good for you so I will leave a link to
the website down below where you guys
can try out the products if you want i
also have a code for you guys because i
love you and if you guys want a discount
code i will have that listed down below
as well as i'll have like oh we stop

the products and like what's good about
them and step listen in the description
if you guys are curious or interested
about the snacks themselves i know i
just think they're really good in the
third like the perfect serving size so
you don't overeat if you're like that's
a problem people is that they overeat a
lot especially when it comes to snacking
you take like your own snacks you might
like to keep taking and fill the bowl
but this is like a controlled sighs yeah
