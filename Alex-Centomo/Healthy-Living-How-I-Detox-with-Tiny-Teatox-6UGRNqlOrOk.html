this kind of different video that I
normally do but a lot of you guys have
really been requesting this so I just
figured I would give it a go and see how
you guys like it basically this is about
a tea talks cleanse I'll just get right
to the point it's a tea talks cleanse
it's not any kind of weight loss you
know pill thing that people take I don't
really believe in that stuff I do
exercise on a regular day basis and I
eat quite healthy so this is just
something that is gonna help aid with me
getting to a healthier lifestyle which
is what I'm trying to do basically right
now and I had the opportunity to
actually work with tiny tea talks and
test out their teas I've actually tried
out of different teas before as you guys
know from my Instagram different kind of
like tea talks and cleanses and all that
kind of stuff and this is by far my
favorite one so I figured I would
actually just spend a video about it and
give you more detail of what it does
because there is a lot of like I guess
unknown to the whole tea talks cleanse
things so let's get into it so
throughout my years and stuff I've just
found personally that I go through
phases where you know I just I'm not
eating healthy anymore I'm not
completely taking care of my body and I
just feel like I need to start fresh so
that's when I find a cleanse just to
kind of like rid your body if the toxins
is very important for me just because I
feel like I can start fresh I can start
new and when I get into my routine again
of working out and eating properly I
just feel like it just it works why I
like to work with tea talks cleanses is
just because I find it's like a natural
way to kind of read my body of the
excess toxins that were in there from
the beginning what I like about your tea
and this is like one of the boxes that
it comes in is that it's a very good
balanced amount of herbs that are you
know made to help with your digestive
system they're made to help with a bunch
of different things
I kind of think of it as like a bunch of
little specks of not dirt but like duck
in your body that I've just been
accumulated throughout the years of not
nothing are not caring but not 100%
trying to make your body help these teas
come in and they play a role in getting
rid of that extra gunk and starting your
body fresh and ready to
you know start a different kind of
lifestyle a healthy lifestyle and that's
what my main goal is for this summer I
really really wanted to start eating
more healthy especially in the month of
July I really you know tried my best to
stop eating out I make all my own food
now I am exercising way more than I've
ever done in my life not in an excessive
way because I was a competitive swimmer
for ten years in my life and I was a
dancer so I did work out a lot but for
someone who's not doing a sport right
now I'm working out more than I guess
the average person would just because I
love it I really find it important that
I'm giving you something that I
personally believe is really really good
it helps me a lot and I just you know I
want to share that with you guys so not
only does the T just like get rid of
that gunk cuz like I like to say it
helps with so many different things for
one it kind of aid with weight loss the
thing I have to stress though with the
whole weight loss thing is that you
can't just expect to drink tea and lose
weight that's not how it works you need
to also be exercising and having a very
balanced diet in order to lose weight
being healthy plays a huge role in
weight loss and I'm not you know
suggesting you guys to lose weight I
don't want you guys to go out and be
like Oh Alex told me I need to lose
weight because I do not want that on my
back but I'm just saying if you are
interested in something to help cleanse
the body then this is something maybe
you'll be interested in anyways not
getting out of the way it does help with
mood swings it helps with clearing out
your skin it can help with allergies
like if you're gluten intolerant or
lactose intolerant and can help aid with
that and it can also help aid bloating
it helps with your digestive system like
I said before there's just a lot of
things that it plays a part into helping
that on a pole can really benefit you in
the long run and that's why I find it's
very important to you know be aware of
your body be aware of what you're
putting inside your body and you know
obviously everyone has their cheat days
everyone has their meals that they
really love you know like pizza and
doughnuts and all that kind of stuff of
course
you know I don't say it kind of that
kind of stuff out of your life and
definitely do not you know because then
one day you'll just end up going on a
huge binge because you've cut it out for
soul
I've been there that's why I'm just
saying that when you kind of want to rid
your body of all that unnecessary stuff
that's been accumulated and you want to
kind of start fresh it's really good -
in my opinion start off with something
like this just because it's natural you
know it's not something that's going to
you know what the pill work it just
helps you lose weight which is not good
and it should not recommend that at all
so this tea is actually formulated with
Chinese medicine herbs and it has been
created by the Chinese medical
practitioners with years of experience
so it's really I find it's a really good
blend of different things that help with
your body I do suggest before you
purchase anything just to read what the
ingredients are and what is best for you
because they do have a range of
different teas like they have the the
your tea has the tiny tea stalks there's
a 14-day cleanse and a 28-day cleanse
14-day cleanse is not as powerful as a
28-day cleanse it's still really good
for someone that you know wants to ease
into it I would suggest the 14-day
cleanse and then there's also like I got
this one it's the her tea and this helps
so much when it's that time of the month
I'm just saying right now this might be
TMI but it helps bloating it helps with
cramps it helps with mood swings so when
you are on that time of the month and
you're just kind of get him out of
everything this really does help and
when it comes to the tea talks cleanse
here I'll open it up so you guys can see
this is the 28-day cleanse I actually
started off with the 14-day cleanse just
to see how it went and then later on I
feel like I might try this one out just
to see how it goes but it looks like
this all the t's come in a little
package like that really cute packaging
by the way and they come in a little
packet like this and what you're
supposed to do there's always
instructions inside but what you're
supposed to do is you have one package
around 30 minutes before you eat
anything so before each meal and then
you eat your meal so three times a day
you want to do that or if you have five
small meals a day I would suggest
picking the three larger meals and you
know having your TV for that so I want
to stress with this that unlike any
other tea talks cleanse or detox cleanse
or whatever this does not cause a
laxative effect it just encourages
healthy weight loss by nourishing the
digestive system digestive system
and it helps you lose weight the right
way you know it doesn't cause the
laxative effect which basically strips
out all the good bacteria that your
stomach and body needs to you know break
down the food that you consume so if
you're stripping all of that it's
actually really bad for you in it
especially in the long run it will cause
so many different problems in your life
it'll actually make you gain more weight
later on and it's just it's not a good
way to do it so what I really liked
about this tea is that it does not cause
that kind of effect this tea actually
just prepares your stomach for a better
digestion and girls have noticed a
difference within the first couple of
days I definitely have noticed a
difference in the first couple of days
and another thing I love about this tea
is that it's all-natural there's no
preservatives nothing else is added into
it it's all super good and clean for
your body so there's no worries about
anything like that and I mean the
packaging is super cute I just really
really like it a lot I do suggest though
if you don't if you don't drink tea
often and don't really like the taste of
tea I would add in a little bit of honey
or a little bit of lemon if you love to
drink tea then you will really love this
and if you don't drink tea I strongly
suggest you guys try this out and let me
know what you think obviously it would
be fun if we could all do this together
and I'm just thinking of like all these
different things I could do now but I do
have to stress for the tea talks like
you cannot just expect to drink tea and
lose weight like I said earlier you need
to exercise and have a pretty balanced
diet you're not gonna like lose weight
by eating McDonald's every single day
and not working out and then drinking
tea and be like why isn't this working
well no wonder it's not working because
you are eating crap
you'd be careful of that yeah not only
that it helps improve skin clarity which
is something that's huge for me because
as you guys know I've struggled with
acne for a long time so that I've
actually really noticed a difference and
again it does help with aiding digestion
which is a huge thing the faster you
digest the faster metabolism will be and
of course it does play a huge part for
me at least in the whole allergy thing
because being gluten intolerant oh
that's one thing I forgot to say is that
they have gluten free tea which is great
because most places don't have a gluten
free alternative so they actually have
free alternative to the tea talks
cleanse so thank you your tea for having
the gluten free because that's something
that's so important to me and in the
long run it can really help out with
those allergies so if you're gluten
intolerant if you're lactose intolerant
if you have any kind of small allergy it
could help clear roll in to helping that
because you know all allergies can come
and go and any time in your life so this
is basically just my update of how I've
been liking these teas I've posted
before that I was trying them out and
you guys really want to see how they
have been doing for me so honestly
they've done incredible I've noticed
like I don't have a lot of fat on my
stomach let's say I do have on my butt
and I've noticed a difference in that
I've noticed a difference a little bit
on my stomach it's definitely looking
flatter because it does help break up
the fat around there and because I've
been working out and eating healthier I
definitely plays a huge role into that
as well and I just feel good on the
inside I feel more energized
I feel more alert I don't feel as drowsy
anymore I used to get up in the morning
and I would just be so tired all day
long and then I would have some trouble
sleeping and ever since I start drinking
this tea it just I feel like less
anxious I feel like I can sleep properly
I feel more awake when I am awake I feel
more alert I feel more like I am you
know listening better to people when
they're talking to me it's just it's
played a huge part in my life and I just
figured that I would share with you guys
because it's super important to me to be
honest with you guys and to be upfront
and to you know let you guys know things
that I do enjoy in my life and what I am
doing in my life and I just think it's a
great thing so maybe I can do like once
a week

don't know like even just healthy snack
ideas healthy food ideas to make at home
