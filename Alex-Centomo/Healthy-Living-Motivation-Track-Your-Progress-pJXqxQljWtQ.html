week on Wednesday I asked you guys if
you would be interested in seeing more
healthy kind of like inspiring videos
and you guys all really wanted to see
that kind of stuff and my last week's
video was more of like a tea talks
talking about that and in this video I
decided to kind of compile a bunch of
questions and then just answer it all in
one video because I do get an
overwhelming amount of questions that
are very similar so I figure that it's
probably just easiest to talk to you
guys through a video anyways so I
thought today I would talk more about
exercising because a lot of you guys
seem to have a lot of questions about
exercising in my workout routine plus
the video I uploaded last week that has
to do with the tea talks cleanse from my
workout workout routine video I very
much explained my kind of everyday
workout routine that's something that I
just do around I tried you to run five
times a week a lot of you guys were
asking about that but it's not the same
every single time that's mostly like
just the majority of the stuff I do
compiled into one video because
obviously you don't want to do the same
thing every single day and that's
something that I want to you know
Express to guys is that it's great you
know exercising often but you want to
kind of do different things every day
you don't want to keep it the same
because it's actually not the best for
you so obviously I like to run I run
every single day which is totally fine
you can do that but if you find running
hard on your knees or your legs or
anything like that I would suggest
something else like the Stairmaster or
swimming or so you know some kind of
machine you can do at the gym I just
like running because it's easy I can
just go outside and run and then ask for
other exercises and stuff there are so
many different things you guys can do
and I always forget that there are so
many of you guys that you know you guys
don't do a sport you which is totally
fine and you weren't raised in an
environment where people taught you how
to you know work out properly and
motivate you and stuff like that I was
lucky enough to grow up being a
competitive swimmer so I had access to a
lot of workout routines and stuff like
that so just basic knowledge to me but a
lot of people didn't have that and I
always forget about that
so I act
we found an app which I've mentioned
before on my Instagram but I know I have
a lot of viewers that actually don't
follow me on Instagram that watch my
videos and it's called pump up app and
it's actually a really great fitness app
because not only is it like motivating
and gives you great exercises routines
and all that kind of stuff but it's also
an amazing community it's kind of like
an Instagram but for like workout kind
of stuff so you have like the popular
page you have like you can hashtag you
can tag you can do all the kind of stuff
but it's more geared towards like the
workout and not only does it have to be
like workout related like fitness wise
you can also post a lot about your diet
and stuff like that like eating healthy
and getting motivating all that kind of
stuff and because it is a really great
community you can talk to people that
are interested in the same kind of stuff
as you and you can kind of like set
goals for yourself and you can make
friends that have the same kind of goals
and work together it's actually really
interesting I'm gonna talk about that in
a little bit but what I want to really
stress for you guys is that everyone has
a different level of exercise for me the
way I exercise and the way I showed you
in my workout routine video is a bit
more advanced than someone that's just
starting out so if you are just starting
out I wouldn't recommend you going full
throttle into something like crazy
because you're just gonna end up
injuring yourself you want to start with
baby steps and it's very important that
you do that because not only will it
help you in the long run it will make
you so strong and so fit so I mean I go
for like 40-minute runs or jogs every
single day not seven times a week oh my
gosh oh I like to get myself like a day
or two days off from running cuz it's
not the best especially for my knees I
kind of have knee problems but then I'll
do like a day of ABS or then I'll do a
day of like legs and butt and then I'll
do a tape arms like today this morning I
did a lot of arm exercises and I've
actually been using the app a lot to
give me inspiration for different kinds
of exercises because I mean I do know a
lot through experience but there is just
so much you can learn not only from the
workouts that are given to you but you
can learn a lot from the people that you
are meeting through the app and
following and it's
just really interesting another thing
that's great about the app is that you
can actually keep track of what you're
doing so you every day every day you
workout you can enter what you've done
exactly and what like routine you've
followed and you can enter if you're
comfortable with it entering your weight
you can enter what you ate you can enter
what you how you worked out and all that
kind of stuff and then every single day
you can enter that kind of stuff and you
can look back to see what you've done
and it can give you goals and it
actually is really smart with the way
that it's set up so that you can kind of
enter what is right for you because
everyone is different like I said before
that you want to kind of do a workout
that's proper for you proper for your
size proper for where you're at right
now in your life if you're more of you
know an active person or if you're
versus someone that's not as an active
person but would like to be at more
active so it's really great for you know
getting to set goals for yourself and
keep track of everything it's super
organized you can really get inspired
but I a lot of people and I realized
that people were getting inspired by me
which was really awesome because it kind
of like gets you motivated to work more
and we're better and I just I think it's
great I mean you guys know me you know
I'm obsessed with social media I'm
obsessed with Instagram I'm always on
Instagram so something that's geared
more toward towards exercising and
incorporating a community with people
based all like the same interests as you
when it comes to that kind of stuff is
awesome
for me because I just like love that
stuff so I'm all up on that I don't know
I said that that was weird yeah so kind
of like touching base of what I said
before
with meaning people through the
community with the app because it's not
just an app that can give you exercises
because I know there are like tons of
apps out there but because of the
community you can actually like find
encouragement from like-minded people
and just like build on that and you guys
can just like inspire each other and you
can work together you can work with me
you guys can follow me on my profile
link that down below and we can just
kind of like work together and almost
like set goals for ourselves and like
it's really cool when you see someone
that like reaches something and then
they post it like yeah I finally did
this and you're just like yes I'm so
happy for you and now it's my turn to
get to that place
oh my god my life was so weird Wow
so the app itself is really cool just
know that like this app is something
that I've actually used and I really
enjoy using and it's just something that
I think would be great for you guys I
think would be great for anyone that's
interested and you know just not even to
like lose weight but just to feel
healthy because it's so important to
feel healthy on the inside and honestly
like I always think to the future I mean
I do live in the moment and stuff like
that but like health-wise and everything
I do look to the future and I want to be
one of those people that is like super
fit not like excessive amount but I want
to be like 80 something years old and be
able to like play with my grandchildren
like all the floor and wrestle with them
and feel like my grandfather was someone
he was like in his late 70s and he was
still swimming and playing tennis like
crazy and he was just super active and I
want to be that kind of person I don't
want to be that person that is too you
know unhealthy to get up from the couch
or to get up from bed and you know I
want to live a long and happy life and I
want to be healthy so this is like I'm
just starting baby steps right now to
work towards that kind of goal oh it's
all so close they keep you posted before
and after pictures which um
I mean I don't really want to post them
before pictures because you guys should
have seen me back in the day you know
what I'm just gonna insert a picture
right here we just take a moment okay
mom what's over so I'm just putting up
the app right here to kind of like show
you guys what you can do so you can
actually build a workout which is just
the middle button there and you can do
either start workout log activity track
weight or share photo so normally when
I'll do a workout I will just log my
activity but when I want to start a
workout you actually can just click the
button and then it shows you a little
thing where it says build a workout so
you click it and then you can either
choose the options lose weight get toned
build muscle or be healthy so let's try
to get toned one over here then you can
do either beginner intermediate or
advanced it's up to you obviously if
you're first starting out I would
consider the beginner usually I'll do
intermediate
advance is pretty intense and then
you're either home gym or away so I'm
gonna stay home and then it asks you
which equipment you guys have so I don't
really have any equipment other than
dumbbells and then it's gonna show you
which muscles so I want to do today my
upper body and then it gives you either
core circuit conditioning circuit or
cardio so you can click too or you can
click one whichever one you want
I'm gonna click these two and then it's
downloading exercises for you which is
pretty awesome and I actually like the
fact that it's an app because you can
bring it anywhere you are because
obviously you can have your phone on you
so if you're away if you're at the gym
anywhere you can just bring your phone
with you and then you click workout
ready and then it gives you little
things to do and they give you like a
little girl kind of demonstrating how to
do it properly which is perfect because
I find a lot of the times when they're
giving you exercises just by like
explaining what to do and you don't
really have someone's showing you what
you can actually be doing it wrong and
then you can actually injure yourself so
it's good that they have like a little
woman over here kind of showing you what
to do on the screen like this as you
could see this little little girl she's
cute if you're interested in downloading
this app I will have it all the
information listed down below don't
forget it's called pump up app it's good
to pumped up but for real
it really does get me pumped up and I
just really enjoy it a lot if you guys
have any other questions or are curious
as to different kinds of routines that I
like to do then you can just check out
the app and follow me my username is
Alex and Homo it's the same thing as my
