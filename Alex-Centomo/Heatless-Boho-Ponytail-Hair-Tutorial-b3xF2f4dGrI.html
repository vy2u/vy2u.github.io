with my sister Kyla ah and if you guys
didn't know which I'm sure a lot of you
do but if you guys don't follow me on
Instagram snapchat and my blogging
channel or basically anything you
wouldn't know that Kyla does YouTube
videos as well and we decided to
actually do a collab what is this just
like a love thing a fun video we're
doing a video together because we posted
this picture on Instagram a few days ago
and I asked you guys which hairstyle you
liked better and I got like so many
comments and you guys all want tutorials
for both of the hairstyles but I
actually have a tutorial for the
hairstyle that I was wearing
but for Kylie's hair I actually found
that on Pinterest so I figured that I
would just give you guys a tutorial
about it because you guys have so many
questions about her hair and it is all
natural you know she does have very very
long long hair that's all braids but I
do like to add some extensions in to
give it to some more volume but stuff
even though her hair is basically the
same length as her extensions it is
right you know my extensions are a bit
longer but it adds more volume because
as you can see my hair is like pretty
flat I don't have very same in my hair's
also really crazy if you guys are
interested in seeing how I'm going to do
her hair than just I'm watching oh and
let's see thing in this video to 7,000
thumbs up again because that would be
awesome I don't know why I did the oh
but Stephanie let's get to 70,000 number
skaters 7000 would be great let's
getting to it using extensions is
completely optional for this look but I
just find it adds a lot of volume and it
just goes perfectly with his hairstyle
so I'm using these extensions which
match perfectly with Kyle's hair they're
the foxy locks luxurious 24 inch clip in
extensions in the shade mocha toffee you
will only need 3 webs for this look so I
just use three of the two clip weft and
then I section her hair off just a
little bit at the bottom it doesn't have
to be a perfectly straight line as you
can see it does not matter at all and
you kind of just rub it in the hair to
tease it a little bit clip it in
and then do a section on top of that I
usually like to go around one hinge on
top of the previous section you can
secure your hair on top of the clip but
since I'm doing it on my sister I'm just
getting her to hold it in place but as
you could see I'm going around where the
top of her ears are and not making a
perfectly straight line and then I'm
adding two weft almost overlapping each
other to make it really thick and that's
all you need for this look so this is
how the hair should look once the
extensions are clipped in it just adds a
little bit of length and volume to her
hair and then the next thing you need to
do is just take two small pieces near
your temples and you want to twist them
back and then you're gonna tie a knot as
if you were gonna be tying a shoelace so
just a regular knot and then you want to
make sure that you pull it tight to
secure it once it is pulled tight you're
just gonna wrap the strands around the
whole hair now this is the part that
gets a little bit tricky basically you
just want to tie that underneath the
ponytail so you can clip it up or I'm
getting Kyla to hold it up for you so
you can see you're just gonna tie
another knot and you're gonna pull that
really tight to kind of make an elastic
with your hair if that makes any sense
you are then just gonna take a few bobby
pins and position them into place you
want to make like a crisscross with the
bobby pins so that they kind of hold it
together and you also just want to make
sure that you're using the same color
bobby pins so that they match your hair
and they are hidden behind then once
that's done you're just gonna want to
make sure everything's hidden and then I
like to pull out some pieces around the
back of my head just to make it a bit
loose and then you're gonna repeat these
steps but you want to make sure to go a
little bit more down so that the crosses
aren't too close together you have some
room in between each tie
once you're done the next step I like to
pull out the section in between the two
ties just to make it really big and
volume is
this is what the finish product should
look like it really reminds me of
Jasmine from Aladdin I think it's so
pretty and perfect for any kind of
bohemian style that you're going for for
any dinner or lunch party or even
wedding I think it's so beautiful if you
