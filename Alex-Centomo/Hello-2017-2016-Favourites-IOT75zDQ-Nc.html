channel I just got out of the shower so
this is why my hair looks like this I
braided it and put it back because
that's how I get my nice waves and I
just did my makeup for the purpose of
this video but I want to quickly say
before I get started with this video
that if you are not subscribed please
subscribe down below and also click the
notification button because of this
whole new YouTube algorithm thing like
so many of you guys aren't seeing my
videos and it sucks cuz a lot of you
think that like I stopped uploading on
my channel but you just either haven't
been seeing my videos or I've gotten a
lot of tweets and comments on my
Instagram saying that you've been done
I'm subscribed to me so make sure that
when you subscribe you also click the
little Bell button and that's just gonna
notify you when my videos do go up so
now that that is settled I do want to
get started in this video 2016 has been
kind of the most crazy year for me I
feel like so many ups and so many downs
I'd say I feel like with my channel and
like kind of what I've done with my life
in the past years has always been kind
of a steady incline like a slow but
steady incline especially based off my
past and all that stuff so if you guys
want to see my two last videos that were
like this I will leave a link or like a
playlist or something down below and
kind of see what I mean by this but 2016
has been kind of like a whirlwind if
that makes any sense like it's been both
good and bad but I'm very happy that the
year has come to an end and I'm very
excited to start 2017 I feel like I'm
starting it on a very positive note and
that's always a good thing because I
don't know like obviously positivity is
better than negativity right I was
talking about this with Daniel this
morning I just felt like this year was
so different for me more than any other
year before in the past and I think it's
because I've had so many not milestones
but big things happen that I just felt
like I wasn't prepared for or not I feel
like I don't know what I want to say
typically with these types of videos I
like to write down my thoughts but this
one I was like I'm just gonna start my
camera and talk so this might be a
little Rambla
apologize about that and I might be all
over the place but I just really want to
sit down and talk to you guys and kind
of express myself I guess this year has
been crazy because for one I got engaged
and like that's obviously a huge
stepping stone for everyone it's they do
believe in marriage and want to get
married so for me that was crazy
it was something that Dan and I did talk
about a lot so it wasn't a surprise like
obviously I didn't know he was gonna do
it then but it wasn't like oh my god
he's proposing what do I say like we
just we had always spoke about it we've
been dating for almost five years like I
already feel like I'm married to him
like there's no difference but it is a
big deal and it's like getting to be
officials so it is exciting that's like
a really good moment that's happened
this year and I'm hitting a million
followers on Instagram that's another
highlight like that was insane it was so
exciting I was in New York when it
happened
you guys know my like love relationship
live in New York City so it was just
perfect and I'm like really happy about
it am really happy that I have all of
you guys it's crazy
although it's not about the number it
still is like such a big deal and it was
really special like I never thought in a
million years that that would ever
happen I still remember when I hit 10k
on Instagram O's with cat Belle and I
was like freaking out because it was
just like such a big deal because 10,000
people I got so many people and still I
was like I couldn't believe it and she's
like oh my gosh imagine we hit a million
one day and we just laughed about it
because there was like no way we were
ever gonna hit a million that was like
that's never gonna happen and we were
just like laughing about it and then I
thought about that the other day I was
like wow like it's crazy how things just
happened in life and I don't get my
happiness from a number on social media
like that's not how I achieve my
happiness another big thing was I signed
with next management or next models
worldwide so a lot of people are
confused over this and I'm just gonna
explain really quickly that there is
like a next models in Toronto Canada but
that's not what I signed with like I
don't know why they're called next
actually somebody I know kind of pointed
out to me because they said they were
scouted by them and they like Oh scouted
by your agency and I was like oh that's
not like they're not associated I don't
know why they have like the same name
but next models worldwide or next
management comm if you check them out
they're an agency that's based out of
like their main one is LA but they also
have New York Miami
I think it's Paris Milan London pretty
sure in Europe and when I was signed I
was signed for world worldwide meaning
that I could work anywhere in the world
and that was really exciting I got to
travel more this year than I've ever
traveled before like I did travel a lot
in 2015 but this one has been more like
a challenging year I went to Bali for
wine which that's like a really long
flight and I've always been nervous to
go there I don't know why it just always
been on my bucket list but also
something that I've been so nervous
about I think because of the flight even
though I've been to Australia like in
the past that was like before I had
traveling xiety so this was just like a
big big deal for me and the fact that I
did it was like I was so proud of myself
and I got to be there with like my best
friends I'm excited for 2017 and I feel
like I don't really like to make new
year's resolutions because I literally
never keep them but I think what I'm
going to try to do in 2017 is work more
on myself 2017 is gonna be year of like
new outlooks and I'm so excited about it
and like have so many plans already so
I'm just I'm happy
anyways that being said I do want to get
into some products slash clothing back
here accessories that I've been loving
for 2016 and probably obviously will
continue to work to use in 2017 but
these are things that I've picked that
I've always gone back to and always used
no matter what the season or whatever it
might be so yeah I figured you guys
would be interested I'll also leave
links down below if I can find anything
some of these things I purchased like
literally in February so I don't know if
it's gonna be available but I'll try I'm
gonna start off with just like products
and stuff and then I'll go into clothing
and accessories after so the first thing
I do want to talk about
is this perfume this has been my perfume
of choice this past year I got this in
the spring and like look how much I've
used like this stuff it's I don't
understand like I've used this almost
daily and it's like barely it looks like
it's been barely used and this is by
Louisville it's the scent santel 33 I
feel like a lot of you guys are familiar
with this but it's like the best smell
holy crap so lil a bow is a I think did
it start in Paris I'm not sure but I
watched the one in New York I'm not sure
if it started in New York or in Paris
but basically they make their cents in
the store like they make it fresh it's
all like natural ingredients it's vegan
cruelty-free like it's it's amazing and
you can sample the cents and they pick
the scent that's best for you and then
they also have like candles and so many
other things but this sense my cousin
was wearing it once and I was like you
smell amazing what is that she told me
and then every time I go to like a hotel
either in London or Paris or New York a
lot of the times they'll have like the
sample creams and shampoos and
conditioners from dalabo
and they always smell amazing and like
the lobby of the Nommo soho smells like
this and every time we go to the Noma
Soho in New York meaning my friends are
always obsessing over the scent in the
lobby and it smells exactly like this so
I was so excited when I got this and
another thing that I do is when I do
either giveaways or when a lot of you
guys buy my stuff like I have an
Instagram account where you can link by
my clothes but I don't talk about it
much on the channel because I don't
update it regularly enough like I put up
something and it's sold right away and I
don't sell that many things like it's
it's not like a daily thing but if you
guys are interested I'll leave a link
down below if you just want to go and
like follow it basically when I send out
the clothing items I spray them with
this and then everyone's like what is
that scent it smells so good and I'm
like santel 30 through by new level not
sponsored just obsessed with the scent
it's it is pricey like I'm letting you
know right now I got the big bottle this
was like $200 or something like that
which is you know extremely expensive in
my perspective for perfume
but considering the fact that I've
almost used it for like
eight months and it's barely gone down I
like can justify that because this is
gonna last you so long
another thing that I've been loving and
I actually got this pretty recent like a
few months ago but I've been using it
all the time is agiza hair oil this is
by the blogger Nagin near cellie he I
think that's how you pronounce her full
name she is a blogger that I've been a
fan of for a while
my best friend Kat his like loved her
forever and we actually met her one time
in New York City she was staying at the
Nomo with us during Fashion Week I think
it's 2015 and obviously cat like freaked
out because her and cat have like very
similar hair and everyone would comment
on cats pictures on Instagram saying oh
my gosh you remind me so much of nagging
and nagging nagging and she was like who
is this person so she followed her and
then she showed me to her and we met her
she was like the sweetest person like
remembered us the next day and spoke to
us I mean I doubt she would remember us
now but she's just like she seems like
such a sweetheart anyways when she
started her YouTube channel I was so
excited because first of all her blogs
are amazing you guys know I've spoken
about it in my blogs all the time she's
just so inspiring she her fashion taste
is like I literally screenshot all her
pictures no I can't how can I recreate
this and I just I love her personality
she seems very down-to-earth very kind
and just like a very smart person and I
think that it's really important
nowadays to have people like that to
follow on social media especially when
you have like a lot of young girls
following you I think she just sets a
very good example and she's somebody
that I look up to in that sense and like
want to do that with you guys so anyways
I should always this is her product and
I was so excited I got it I bought it
for me and I bought it for Kat for
Christmas and she opened and she was so
excited it's literally the best thing of
life I mean you can see right now my
hair is literally in a braid but it has
done such amazing things to my ends and
like my hair has been looking better
than ever and a lot of you guys even
noticed it Tess had this and she spoke
about it and I like asked her her
thoughts and she told me like it was
amazing so that was I mean a big reason
why I bought it
Tesla's just like raving about it so
really happy about that if you guys are
curious to follow her I'll leave her
legs down below please do and tell her
that I sent you because that would make
me really happy she is just like goals
in life then for makeup products I can
only think of two because I obviously
switch up my makeup all the time but
these are the two things that I always
always go back to this is the Becca
highlighter and champagne pop I feel
like everyone knows about this
highlighter if this is just like my
go-to and then this is the Kylie lip kit
in Dolce K I got this for Coachella and
I've been using it all the time and I'm
just like I love it I think it's really
good okay I want to talk about the
sunglasses a bit because you guys know I
have like a serious sunglass obsession
but there are two that I have constantly
rotated throughout the year on my trips
wherever I go and the first one is this
pair from sailor ah it's the ceilin off
surf collection and they are these
really awesome sunglasses I'm sure you
guys recognize these from my videos and
my pictures on Instagram they're so
funky and I just I love them they're not
everyone's favorite but they're mine and
I don't care and I wear them all the
time then I got these ones from Alan
last year or not last year but like oh
yeah last year 2016 while that's still
weird very pricey but they are the bomb
so I didn't really mind oh the glasses
are so smudgy but they are these like
mirrored lenses they're white gold and
they're so awesome so I wore these a ton
in 2016 and still going to be wearing
them for sure and then onto regular
glasses these are my actual glasses
they're from Garrett lights so many
people ask me where I got these and yes
Garrett light I love the look of these
glasses okay I'm gonna talk about shoes
for a bit because uhm why not I love
shoes these shoes I got them for
Coachella they're from Nasty Gal and I'm
pretty sure they still sell them now
because I see a lot of people wearing
them they're just like simple black
boots that go up a little bit
have worn the crap out of these like
they are so they don't even look that
bad but they've been gone they've gone
through like the most crazy terrains
obviously got them shine so they're like
pretty fresh looking but shouldn't seen
them before
this bomber jacket can you see so you
guys might recognize this this is a
vintage amaze bomber it's a really
amazing blueish purple color it's
reversible so they have this like it's
almost like a velvet you know velvet not
sweet it's like a really I don't know
how explain it but it's it's navy blue
on the other side so you could switch it
if you wanted to and I just always wear
this so it's really it's a quilted it's
almost a little thick so it's perfect
for when the weather is cold this shirt
by made worn the rolling stones it's
like a vintage II looking shirt I
actually got this in Barney's in New
York City but they sell them on revolve
if you guys are curious I got it in the
size large so it's a bit bigger and it's
just the rolling stones and I love the
stones I've been a fan of them since I
was a child obviously my dad is in a
band he grew up listening to rock and
roll and so I have my fair share of
favorite bands this sweater
can you see this this is a super
oversized sweater from Free People I got
this for a New York Fashion Week but I
literally wear it all the time and
everyone seems to be obsessed with it
it's like a rosy dusty pinky purple
color it's literally a sweater dress
like it's so long and so oversized the
last clothing item is this denim jacket
definitely could not have a favorites
video without a denim jacket this is
vintage from Wrangler I believe yeah
denim blue and I love this for so long I
worked with so many outfits then
I have this sweater that has been a
favorite of mine is from Zara it's so
comfortable these chokers have been a
favorite that's why I'm wearing them
this one is from Jackie H and this one
is from our um I and I always wear these
together I love them and the last thing
I want to talk about is this purse this
purse has been a favorite of mine this
year because this was a designer purse
that I bought for myself and I was
really really proud that I saved up and
was able to get this for myself I don't
have to like ask for my parents help or
anything and I just think it's so
beautiful
and says you all she i think it's an
anti gonna bag and medium it's the matte
black one and i think it's just perfect
it has the longer strap so you can wear
it over your shoulder and it fits
literally everything in here and i'm
just I love it so much it's like my fave
