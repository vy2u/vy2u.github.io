deciding to do a holiday hair tutorial
I've been getting so many requests to do
another hair tutorial for a while I just
didn't know what to do because I feel
like I've literally done like every
single hairstyle but a lot of you were
curious as to how I'm going to wear my
hair for the holiday season like for
Christmas dinner or you know anything
that you celebrate for like a fancy
dinner part of it and I'm actually since
I cut my hair I've been kind of playing
around different ways to do my hair and
I didn't want to show you something that
I've already shown before so I actually
found something that completely changed
the way that I'm ever going to curl my
hair again because it is like the
easiest thing to do and it's just
anyways I'm gonna get into it because
it's like amazing so first things first
obviously got to protect your hair from
the heat so I'm using this by new me
it's just the heat protectant serum I
love it because it smells so freakin
amazing just rub it through my hands and
then just apply it to where I'm going to
be applying the heat now I washed my
hair last night and I slept on it down
and I woke up this morning and this is
what it looked like this is my natural
hair as you can see it's like kind of
curly kind of wavy kind of straight kind
of I don't know how to explain it but
basically this is my hair then you just
take your comb any comb and you want to
get out any knots because when you are
styling your hair the worst thing to do
is style it when there are knots in your
hair now that your hair looks like a
lion's mane
well at least mine does we're going to
move on to the hair so this is the
device that I'm talking about I know
you're probably thinking Alex what the
heck is that thing it's huge and
complicated looking and yes I know
because the first time I saw this I was
like whoa what is that but I actually
discovered it online it's the InStyler
tulip wand and this is meant for curling
your hair
there's a cute it is meant for curling
your hair and it's actually the easiest
way I've ever found curling my hair not
only does it take half the time but it
is so easy so basically on this like
device thing which it's funny you have
the actual wand itself which is the
black piece right here and then you have
this guard that goes around the edge and
that's actually just like a protectant
so you don't burn your face or your neck
or whatever you're doing because if
you've watched like any of my other
tutorials you know that I say multiple
times that I am like the queen of
burning myself when I use my curling
iron this thing is like super easy
because it doesn't like you can't burn
yourself which is the best thing ever
and then also you have different heat
settings so you have like a low a medium
and a high depending on you know kind of
hair you have I usually don't need to
put it that high because my hair curls
very easily and then you do have
settings for how long you want this to
turn for so there's either three seconds
eight seconds or 12 seconds and the
three seconds is for more like a loose
wave kind of thing eight seconds is more
of like a beachy wave so it's like a bit
tighter and then 12 second is obviously
for a tight curl look so you can decide
you know how you want your curls to turn
out by using this and then the other
part is just which way you want the
thing to rotate so what's great about
this that's different from the other
brands is that it's actually easier to
use because it does switch directions so
you can have it going one way and then
switching the opposite way and you don't
have to really move the wand it's
literally just like problems out about
them and you're done and it's easy to
use in the back as well because again
like it's so big and like it turns in
direction that you want and like I also
like that it's super lightweight and
doesn't doesn't feel super heavy and
also this thing doesn't get hot at all
so you can literally like just leave
this down and it's totally fine so
anyways without you know explaining it
I'm just gonna turn it on so I'm gonna
put it to low because that is the
setting that I want and it does heat up
quite fast so which is also a plus I'm
gonna keep it on the 3-second setting
because I want more of the loose curl
kind of look and then I'm going to have
it going left because I wanted to go
away from my face
now I do have to say when I first took
this out of the box I was kind of like
oh my gosh my hair is so gonna get
tangled around the barrel but that's
what's great about the timer is that it
doesn't and as soon as it feels that
your hair is gonna get caught it stops
rotating so it won't get caught which is
awesome and then of course you just have
a little button here which you press to
make the thing turn and to make it stop
once that's heated up you're gonna take
a section of hair you're literally just
gonna place it in front through the
little machine and then you press you
hold for as long as you need I usually
don't need to hold my curls for that
long because they curl pretty easy and
you pull out and have a beautiful wave
look at that oh my gosh guys it's a way
whoo but seriously that took like this
thing takes no time at all so here I'm
just gonna do a few more sections if
you're interested in getting one of
these sets I will have a link down below
which you can click and if you buy one
you get the other one for free which is
pretty awesome so if you want to get it
for a gift for someone like your sister
or your mom or a friend it's like a
perfect thing because it's free oh it's
so pretty and like dainty I love it and
I also start like halfway down my head
because I don't want the curl to start
up too high because I just you guys know
I don't like that look I'm gonna take a
longer section so you guys can see in
the front you have this little open
section here you literally just place
your hair inside of that section pull it
over and hold I usually hold it around 5
to 10 seconds depending how tight I want
the curl but normally don't have to hold
it that long pull it out and you got a
curl up these types of curls remind me
of like fancy events which is perfect
for a holiday look because you want your
hair to be more fancy
now I'm going to switch sides so I'm
gonna make it go right and I'm doing the
right side of my head get it right for
the right side put it through the little
piece pull it and hold super easy no
free Oh guys though like this seriously
like change is the way I'm going to curl
my hair because it takes like two
seconds wait look at that curl how nice
is that can you see that
like I'm so obsessed with this thing I
know that I have like so many friends
and even like my cousin they always text
me and they're always like how the hell
if you curl your hair like I just cannot
do it just does not look the same I
don't know what I'm doing so like for
those kinds of people if you are one of
those people or if you have a friend
that's like that I feel like this
product is the perfect for that because
it is like it's basically meant for
people that don't know how to curl their
hair and it's just super simple it just
makes everything so easy so what are you
guys up to for the holidays what are
your plans leave in the comments like
what you guys normally do for the
holidays oh my gosh I can't get over
these curls they're so nice I love like
getting together with family on the
holidays I think it's so much fun
there's just a lot of laughing and
smiling and good times what food so it's
just like the best time of the year
because as you know I love being
positive and I love happiness and I love
smiling and having a good time then I
kind of just run my fingers through the
curls because I don't want them to be
too tight
then of course God takes on my texture
spray oh and I forgot to mention that
mention the Installer is actually really
good for all hair types like you can
have thin hair thick hair and it works
perfectly fine I actually did this with
my extensions in so like my super long
thick extensions and my hair looked
incredible like I actually loved it and
I got so many compliments on it people
were like oh my gosh how did your hair
and I was like but basically this is the
finished look now what you want to do
next with your hair is completely up to
you you can either like pin it back if
you want you can put your hair up and
have some pieces falling out I love the
way this frame is my face and they give
that same beachy vibe that I do with my
straightener and this takes like half
the amount of time and it is so easy
look how cute this would look in a
ponytail oh my gosh you guys that is so
cute oh maybe I want to wear my hair
like this for Christmas oh I don't know
guys leave it down below if you think I
should wear my hair down or to the side
or in a really cute full pony look how
full that looks oh my gosh
I'm officially obsessed with this thing
