cousin Sofia she just loves being in my
videos soon as I do I thought since the
time is appropriate to do a little
holiday lookbook slash makeup and hair
so this one is pretty appropriate for
like any teenage girl even in your 20s
it'll look really nice we did three
outfits and we did some makeup and hair
just like this girl
and yeah so I hope you guys enjoy it if
you like this video don't forget to give
it a thumbs up and subscribe and go
follow Sofia on Instagram I will link
her little thingy her down user yeah
yeah so go check it out and follow her
and I hope you guys are having a
wonderful day and let me know in the
comments below what video I would like
to see next so I'll see you guys in a
second
moisturizer is so important during the
winter months and I just love this one
by Aveeno I find it doesn't leave my
skin oily and it gets rid of that
flakiness that comes along with the cold
months and then I've used my Smashbox
photo-finish Lite primary just to prime
the face before I set makeup and this is
normally how I apply primer I have been
loving this new foundation it's by
covergirl and it's their state flawless
three-in-one foundation I like to apply
this with my Beauty Blender just so that
it doesn't get any streaks or anything
and this just really helps blend it in
properly can't forget the concealer this
is my absolute favorite concealer by Mac
it's the Pro Longwear concealer and I'm
in the shade and c30 and I just used
this on Sofia because it matches her
skin and I like to apply this over any
blemish or redness and make it look like
you have perfect skin you really don't
magic of makeup and then I take this
Urban Decay deselect setting spray and I
spray it all over my face just to make
sure my makeup stays on all day and then
I set it with my L'Oreal True Match
powder and I really like this powder a
lot as it's superfine and doesn't make
your skin look cakey NARS Laguna bronzer
is by far the best bronzer to use for
contouring because it isn't as pigmented
as hoola by benefit but it does give a
nice deep contour and then I just use
this blush by NARS I forget the name but
I'll link it down below and it just
gives you a really nice flushed look as
if you were playing outside in the snow
which I really like and then this
beautiful highlighter by Mac it's called
pearl and it just gives you a really
nice area doesn't glow and I just really
like it for the whole anytime
gotta prime those eyelids I like this
one by NARS because it doesn't leave my
eyelids oily and then I go in with this
beautiful color it is kitten by Stila
and it's just super sparkly and pretty
perfect for the holidays I really like
it especially for all over the lid and
in the inner corners / tearduct because
it just reflects off the light and it's
super pretty and yeah I just really do
like it let's just all take a moment to
look at my beautiful editing skills and
this is Cory by Mac and I like to apply
this in the outer corner and then bring
it into the crease just to break up the
look a little bit and give some
dimension to the eye also I apologize
for my dogs barking in the background
yeah there's nothing I can do about that
on to the best part the eyebrows got to
brush those silly bad boys out so they
stay in place before you apply the
shadow and I just like to use this brow
kit by benefit it is in the shade light
and I like to apply this onto the
eyebrows just to make them a bit fuller
and thicker and then I brush them out
again to make them all clean and then I
come in with my Revlon Colorstay in
blackest black and I apply this to the
upper lash line and the tight line to
make the eyelashes look really thick
before you apply mascara and then onto
my favorite mascara at the moment is the
Revlon lash potion in waterproof I just
apply this to the top and bottom lashes
and it just gives you a really nice full
look dude this lipstick is so pretty
but I don't remember the name so you'll
have to check out the description but
it's just a really nice pink color and
it's perfect for any team to wear during
the holidays it's not too overpowering
and here is the finished look it's just
really subtle and pretty and perfect for
any occasion and it's not too
over-the-top using my new Tresemme
keratin smooth heat protectant spray I
just like to apply this onto the hair
before I use any heat and then I brush
it out to it distribute it evenly and
then I just grab sections of hair and
I'm using this Conair one and a quarter
inch wand and I just like to wrap the
hair going away from the face hold it
for a couple seconds
and let it cool in my hand and let it
drop and it's super pretty nice loose
curls and I just really like this
I decided to pull Sofia's hair back on
one side because I thought it gave a
really nice feminine and classy touch to
the look and I just thought it was super
cute and pretty and of course you can't
forget the hairspray because your hair
might fall out after a long night of
eating and playing with your family and
celebrating the holidays
you
he's recording yeah oh my god oh my god
mr. what I just hate what you do wait
the whole video just in my face I got my
eyes are going to oh oh oh it will just
look like this have one strand hanging
just like thank you really in do a
little twirl yeah yeah yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
