channel I am here today on my blogging
camera again because I'm doing another
week in my life I've decided to do one
of these every single season when
something really exciting is going on so
I decided to film over Christmas and New
Year's just so that I have these
memories kind of on this channel you
guys really love to see my life and I
really appreciate it if you guys didn't
know I actually have a almost daily
vlogging channel with my fiance Daniel
so I will have that link down below if
you guys want to check it out and see we
would get up to almost on the daily I
didn't vlog much for that channel during
this time because I really want to
capture the memories for this video and
if you're new to this channel make sure
to subscribe down below and turn on
those notifications and also give this
video a thumbs up to let me know if you
like these types of videos I think
they're a lot more personal they're
really fun not very planned kind of just
go with the flow and make four really
fun memories to look back on so I'm
gonna start with the beginning my
parents and my sister came over to my
house for Christmas morning which was so
fun we've never done that before and we
did a Secret Santa this year so normally
we all just get each other presents but
we said you know what this year let's
make it fun and exciting let's pull up
names a few weeks before Christmas and
whoever you pick that's what you got a
present for it's cheaper you can make a
more personal and it's a lot of fun to
get surprised when Kris this morning
because you don't know who had you and
you also get to surprise a person so
here are those clips okay so my dad got
my mom for Secret Santa you got her and
then his present accidentally fell out
nice for Mandy oh yeah you guys go
together so mom since you opened your
Secret Santa gift no you have to give
your Secret Santa gift okay well here's
the thing I bought everybody presents
and I was waiting to find out who you
had did you forget oh you picked me but
you you told me what you wanted but I
wasn't sure if you were gonna get nobody
got me any mystery books so I didn't
know if you were gonna get a whole bunch
so no no I didn't get anything that I I
got things that were bad there cuz
Daniel got me no Malone candle but yeah
I know you can get me anything that's
okay mom I got this beautiful Lululemon
legging okay so then Daniel you give
your Secret Santa gift okay oh you got
me no way Daniel said he knew exactly
what he was gonna get you so I don't
know what it is more excited than you
know the box is just a box that's the
box of ice skates came in other side it
opens oh wow books are to trick you know
we like to trick but you're not supposed
to say we're tricking you Game of
Thrones books
what is that manicure pedicure why the
other nails look at my feet Alex no Kyle
you have to give your secrets out did
you that's good
no I've got a Renault Daisy yes you
could get your barbecue I can get
anything I can get more - well that's
sure you want to do tools so I was lucky
enough to get my dad for Christmas and
I've been wanting to do this for him for
so long my dad has been playing guitar
ever since he was young he is a musician
he's an Abed of rock and roll from the
70s well 60s 70s and 80s and it's always
been a dream of his to play not even own
a Les Paul especially from the 70s so I
was able to work a little magic and get
one for him
vintage 1977 Les Paul Gibson guitar and
here is me surprising him I can't
believe it remember me
no it's romance novels man yeah could
like write a pound of paper with it
oh you gotta be kidding me are you
serious oh my god be careful that's the
vintage part - are you serious oh my god
wow you have to be kidding me oh my god
it's incredible
do you love it oh my god thank you Oh
Alex you didn't have to go crazy like
this Wow yeah everything all the parts
are vintage so obviously there's some
scoffs everything the guy kept it in
really good condition
Wow Wow this is incredible
this is a vintage case - it's beautiful
I can't believe it
this is really really something special
yeah
I've never gotten a gift like this in my
life never never so much I can't believe
that's seventies yeah it's a Gibson yeah
standard with just Daniel welcome being
obviously if ever in years you want to
sell it it would be a lot of money so
always yeah I know but I'm just saying
if ever Alex something do you love it
I'm so happy yeah so my dad checked out
the serial number and it says your
guitar was made at the Kalamazoo plant
mission
remember 1977 production number 20
that's so cool
this is the Holy Grail incredible why
did you always want this type of guitar
because of the sound the the fatness of
it Jimmy Page played a Les Paul I love
you era Les Paul was the inventor of the
Gibson it's solid wood it's look at that
and look at the neck it was with neck
then that everything I love the color I
love the weight I love to feel the neck
yeah it's it's gorgeous I can't wait to
hear it
sweet look at the cool case - I wonder
what the story this is who is the
original owner and wearing it go dad
that looks good I'm not worthy yes you I
thank you so that was really special and
touching because I've always wanted to
do something like that for my dad my dad
told me story when he was younger and he
started to make some money and he bought
his dad a car and his dad like couldn't
accept it he was like I can't take this
from you and my dad didn't understand
why his dad like didn't want it because
his father was saying no like use your
money for yourself you worked hard for
it like don't spend it on me
and now my dad says he understands why
his father thought that way because my
dad is the same way and there's nothing
that brings me more joy in life than to
give something into somebody to make
them really really happy it doesn't have
to be materialistic in this case it's a
lot more sentimental than it is material
because it's something that my dad has
wanted his whole life and never ever
thought he would be able to own that was
really special and then obviously I
surprised Daniel for Christmas and got
him something special too
a little bit more materialistic but he
was still really surprised and I was
happy why do you not want it of course I
do
oh I wasn't sure I was like is this the
one he wanted yes that's sick you
actually bought this Nintendo what is
that it's the new Nintendo Cosmo
oh wow you actually hmm I wasn't sure
which games you've run three games I
wasn't sure which one that was the one
you were talking about that one time oh
my god Allie you always do the friggin
best present I know I mom and dad this
morning I was like Alex does the best
game are you freakin crazy oh yeah wait
where are the games are gonna go up this
so long is this so exciting I can't
believe you bought this is this the one
everyone's talking this is the one yeah
the other two are just fun it's like so
