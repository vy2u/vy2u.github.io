welcome back to my channel sorry about
that disgusting noise I just made hmm I
think I'm getting a cold which really
sucks cuz I'm about to leave for Hawaii
if you guys don't know I'm leaving for
Hawaii on Monday and I'm so excited
we're going to Maui and Oahu and quiet
just like ah I'm just really really
excited stay tuned for all those travel
vlogs and lookbook videos and just
really cool pictures on Instagram I'm so
excited
why is like the main place I've wanted
to go since I was I know since I saw
lilo and Stitch literally probably not
literally probably that makes no sense I
asked you guys on Instagram yesterday to
ask me questions on like any kind of
travel questions you guys had because I
know this is like my one of my most
requested things is how I travel so much
if you've been following me for a while
you know that I recently aka a year ago
started traveling a lot more and my
Instagram has kind of turned into like a
more travel blogger slash fashion rather
than just fashion I used to just do like
whitewall pics like against my wall
which is outfits now I'm a lot more into
traveling and a lot of you guys have
questions on how I travel so often how
do I Ford it what to do about anxiety
when traveling like just a bunch of
questions I think the most asked
question is honestly um how I travel so
much and like how can I afford it so
basically since I started making my I
guess account into more of a travel blog
that's kind of like part of my job now
because if you don't know YouTube and
Instagram is a job for a lot of social
networking people and this is my
full-time job it's my career it's my
passion it's what I love to do and a
year ago
I booked a trip for Dan and I to
Barbados for his like birthday slash
Christmas present we really want to go
away somewhere and I had points that I
could use for the flight so what I did
was I booked us our flights and then we
kind of both pitched in for the hotel
slash excursions I took a ton of
pictures I mean a travel vlog I took I
filmed a video there and it did really
really well on my account people loved
it and then in February as well as in
April I had Coachella plan so Windsor
flew us out in February for a photo
shoot they flew me Karina and tests out
for a photo shoot
they were like doing a whole lookbook
around Coachella they wanted us to be
the models even though we're not models
they just wanted they use a lot of
youtubers we were picked for Petrella
which was amazing and I was so excited
so we float to LA in February we spent
around almost a week there we did a
shoot in Palm Springs we spent a few
days in LA it was really quick really
fun and then when I got back from that
my friend Mel wanted to do a photo shoot
for her bracelet company which is by
Melanie archery a lot of you guys know
who she is because of my blogs and stuff
and if you don't I'll leave her links
down below she makes incredible
bracelets I love her Instagram account
it's all about like traveling meeting
new people stepping outside your comfort
zone all stuff that I'm super into and
so we went to Florida and my friend Emma
came as well and we stayed with her
uncle's so that flight was pretty cheap
because for us flying to Florida it's
not expensive especially at that time of
year was really cheap to fly there
especially we were flying to like a
place that wasn't popular in Florida
because it was where her uncle lived I'm
in like a random town not like my having
or anything la was paid for through
Windsor and then Barbados and Florida
were quite cheap and then when I went to
LA back in LA in April I believe that
was paid for as well because Windsor
paid for us to go and actually attend
Coachella which was amazing incredible
experience and I'm so thankful for them
they're awesome I get to go back to
Coachella again this year and I'm just
so excited about it
I then had a meeting in New York City
which I was flown out for again so a few
of the trips within the first half of
the year I bought two and were flown out
for three and then I really really
wanted to try something on my own so
what I did was I was in contact with um
actually a youtuber here I'm not gonna
like discuss who it is cuz I don't I'm
not sure if they're gonna want their
name put out there for this but
basically one of the British youtubers
was helping me book a trip to Greece and
they kind of explained where they stayed
and like what they really liked about
the hotel and stuff and they were in
Santorini and I really want to go to
Santorini with my boyfriend so I reached
out to the hotel and I said I have a lot
of travel pictures on my Instagram
account I would love to make a video for
you guys and you know promote you guys
as much as I can because there they are
small boutique hotel they're not like a
main chain Hilton Hyatt resort like Four
Seasons it's not like a big chain
they're small boutique hotel and they
responded and they said like
would love to have me stay there and
they just asked that if I post pictures
on Instagram that I tagged them in the
pictures my flight was not free I had to
pay for like my boyfriend I had to pay
for flights but we got to stay in the
hotel for free which was by far like the
coolest thing ever because it was a
beautiful hotel like I we both discussed
that we want to go back and stay at the
hotel again and like maybe for a
honeymoon or something I don't know if
we get married like that's we loved that
hotel and it was genuine it was perfect
it was very quiet and it wasn't like in
the main city so you can rent ATVs or a
car and you can drive into iya or FITA
and it was just perfect location very
tranquil and very calming and that's
what I really like when traveling
because I'm an anxious person actually I
was kind of nervous because it was a
very expensive hotel and I was like you
know why a lot of my viewers are young
and I feel like they're gonna think I'm
like Oh like just promoting something
for money they did not pay me to promote
them yeah I stayed there for free but
you know we bought all her food we ex
pay for her food we weren't in the hotel
that much we actually went out and did
things so we did everything all in the
island of Santorini it was like anything
we could do we did that and we paid for
everything ourselves so we just loved
the hotel like honestly in my lookbook
when I posted their link you guys
actually slick that the hotel sold out
for the rest of the summer so a lot of
you guys loved that place and they were
so thankful cuz they were actually able
to track the links and they were like
holy crap we've never had this many
sales we never have this much exposure
like thank you so much like you did so
much for us they had a lot of exposure
when like the other youtubers stayed
there but they didn't do as like as much
as I did like I really promoted them on
all aspects of my social media not to
say that like they didn't do a good job
cuz I don't think they're even promoting
them like they weren't asked to stay
there they just did and I think they
actually paid to stay there but I don't
know I freaking love the hotel and I
guess you guys did too and I was just
like oh my god like this is such a cool
thing that I could go around promoting
these small because I do that with small
companies you know I like to give
promotion to the ones that you know
where they're starting out and they're
amazing they just don't know how to get
their name out there I have an audience
so why not tell you guys about something
that I genuinely like and that is really
good product but they just don't know
where to start so I was thinking of
doing the same thing with hotels as well
like small boutique hotels that no one
would really know about some of them are
very
inexpensive some of them are more on the
pricey side I kind of was like
experimenting with different places and
seeing what I like two different hotels
and then hotels started reaching out to
me so sometimes the flight was included
sometimes it's not and I'm 100% certain
that that's what all the travel bloggers
do if you follow any travel accounts on
Instagram if you follow their blogs that
is what their do what they do either
they are given a media rate so like for
example on when Hawaii and we're staying
at a hotel and I just had to pay like I
paid for the hotel but they gave me a
little bit of a discount if I just gave
them a bit of a shout-out so I'm still
paying for it but I'm getting like 10%
off or something which is like you know
a lot of times bloggers will get more
they'll get like 50 to 60% off and then
they do like a huge promotion like I
know like accounts with million-plus
followers get to do that so if ever
you're curious as to know like how they
get to travel so much I'm sure that's
what it is but also we do still pay so I
mean I can't speak for them I speak for
myself mainly who knows maybe they just
pay for it and then they just can use
that to write off for their tax purposes
because it is like business for them um
and yeah so that's kind of like what
I've been doing a lot of times I'll pay
for the full trip myself like that's
just you know because I want to go
somewhere and I just feel like
experiencing it not having to do any
work when I'm there meaning like having
to promote this one thing so a lot of
times we'll just pay for it myself
sometimes I'm flown up for a meeting if
I have like let's say I was flown up to
LA because I had a meeting I had a few
meetings actually and it's a lot of
times it's hard to do through Skype and
you just want to be seeing the person in
person and discussing things one-on-one
rather than just like Skype or phone
call it's just easier to you know
especially you have so many different
things going on so sometimes it's like
that but my tips for you guys for people
that don't do this as their job I just
want to answer back it was just like my
most questioned thing ever on any of my
social media accounts was how I traveled
so much so for you guys how I used to
because I used to travel a lot before I
did this as like my job what I would do
is I would either book through Expedia
which is they're not sponsoring this
video at all don't even though I'm
talking about them I used to book
through Expedia all the freaking time
like
seriously every trip I ever booked with
through Expedia it just gives you the
best deal with like your hotel and your
plane and then you collect points so I
was actually a Gold Plus member and I
got to stay in so many places for
discounted rates because I like books so
much through them and then I also have
an aeroplane card so I don't know where
you guys live in the world by I live in
Canada and I fly a lot with Air Canada
and so air miles and Aeroplan they go
along with that so I have an aeroplane
card and I use it every time I buy any
flight any time I can use Aeroplan like
at the grocery store buying gas I will
use it you collect points and then you
can use those points for free air miles
basically so I know my friend Mel uses
it she actually flew to Toronto recently
for free I could fly to New York for
free I can actually buy a plane ticket
to Europe right now for for free because
of how many points I have so that's a
really good way to start savings so
whatever airline you usually take try
and get there like air mile cards so
that you could start collecting points
because a lot of the times I suggest
this to anyone because it's free you
just you can use it at gas stations you
can use it at grocery stores if you're
doing shopping anyways might as well use
it because you're gaining points from it
yeah might take a while to gain up
enough points to actually like get some
kind of thing from it but eventually
it'll happen like me it took you know
when I Scott my L miles card or Alpine
card card I was like 15 and I used it a
ton and I was like 19 20 you know it's
just something that you save up after a
while when I was working a lot at Brandi
I decided to have a savings account for
like savings savings that I'm not going
to touch for a while and a travel
savings so I would put away a certain
amount of money a month for travel
purposes
honestly now's the time to travel I
didn't care if I was broke when I got
home because you come back a different
person you're paying for the experience
it's just such an amazing opportunity
for you guys to do i really suggest
traveling a lot because you get to see
so much in the world things that you
would never see where you where you live
where you grew up in and I wish I could
travel alone I just don't think I ever
could
so because of my anxiety maybe one day
who knows but I always have trouble of
with at least one person I prefer
traveling with a group because it's just
more fun when you're like four people
and you get to just bond okay now on to
travel anxiety so I actually don't have
anxiety
with traveling I have anxiety on planes
I hate flying I'm getting a lot better
but it's still like I get very very
anxious I have gotten off like three
planes before where we've been like on
the plane and I haven't taken off but I
was like I need to get off this plane
and the plane has literally has had to
go back to the gate so I could get off
and it was like a big scene it was very
embarrassed but you know it's something
that I'm working on and it's a struggle
each time because I love traveling it's
just the flying part I'm like oh I don't
know it's just being in a confined space
where I have no control over the
situation that's what freaks me out but
once I'm there once I mind I'm fine
that's really where my anxiety comes in
and my tip for you guys if you do have
travel anxiety is keep yourself
distracted keep yourself busy keep
yourself positive talk to somebody make
sure the person you're with knows how
you're feeling and kind of no not knows
how to deal with it because honestly if
the person doesn't have anxiety they're
not going to really understand or know
how to deal with it but just that
they're supportive and just that they're
there for you makes a ton of difference
I like to listen to music I like to
write or color I have coloring books
that could color in watch movies on the
plane just do things that distract me or
sleep so sometimes I'll take a grab all
because that just passes me out and so
I'll take a gravel plus it just I get in
kind of nauseous which then makes me
anxious because I have a phobia of
throwing up so I just take a gravel and
then fall asleep and when I wake up
normally I'm fine if when them in the
Arab fine it's literally taking off in
turbulence that's the only time landing
I'm totally fine in the air straight I'm
totally fine it's literally turbulence
taking off because I freaked myself out
and I just overthink everything just
keeping myself distracted not thinking
about what's going on is the best thing
ever during turbulence
I literally just try and meditate I try
to clear my head
know that turbulence is so normal and
it's not like the plane is crashing
you're just going through the air waves
and it's just the air pockets in the air
from the hot in the cold air coming
together you're not going to fall if
there was no turbulence in the sky there
would be no gravity on earth so that
needs just put that in perspective for a
second also I feel like this shirt is
like probably no because of the stripes
it might be tripping you guys out I'm
sorry about that what else was I asked
some of my favorite places I've traveled
to I went to Australia before I didn't
YouTube or anything and I think that was
one of my
or trips I loved London and I love
Santorini I just fell in love with
Santorini so much Greece is just so
beautiful but I feel like Hawaii is
gonna be like my next favorite because
I've always wanted to go to Hawaii I was
a huge fan of Jurassic Park lost lilo
and Stitch like so many movies that take
place in Hawaii I'm just obsessed with
also when you are traveling make sure
that you are very aware of like let's
say visas sometimes you need a visa to
get into the country if you're staying
for certain amount of time make sure
your passport is not expired because
that has happened to a friend of mine
where she was supposed to go somewhere
and she couldn't she got to the airport
in her passport was expired
bad bad bad make sure you have enough
money for food so keep that in mind if
you want to do any excursions just
really save up and plan for it properly
going different places in the world is
such an amazing experience and it's just
something that I have such a passion of
right now and you know I hope to
continue it when I do have children
because I want them to love traveling as
well and I just think if I can recommend
doing anything with your life when
you're in your 20s travel do it
it's incredible anyways I hope this was
helpful if I missed anything just leave
it down in the comments I'm going to go
through them and answer as much as I can
because I feel like I didn't hit every
point and if you guys have any
suggestions on places I should come
visit like if you're from somewhere that
you would love me to come visit I know I
get Spain all the time I would love to
visit Spain so many places in Europe I'd
love to visit I do have plans to go to
South Africa and Bali which is really
exciting um so yeah just a lot of really
cool places I love you guys all so much
