many requests lately to do a what's on
my iPhone / how I edit my Instagram
pictures now I did this around a year
ago but I mean obviously it's completely
different now thought of instead of
doing a like a what's on my iPhone
because I pretty much have like the same
setup it's my old video if you're
interested in saying that I will link it
down below I thought in today's video I
can go more into depth about the apps I
use for editing my pictures for
Instagram so if you guys don't know
which I'm sure most of you do but I
actually run a like pretty good fashion
slash pair account on Instagram and if
you're interested in seeing all my
pictures I will leave the link down
below but you could follow me it's just
at Alex Jacomo or centum oh whatever you
want to pronounce it basically I edit my
photos differently when like each season
I guess I added them differently because
my winter pictures I want them to be
more like wintery and my son picture is
more summery obviously so I use
different filters and stuff but since it
is winter right now I figured I would
show you guys what apps I use because I
use all different apps I use the same
apps no matter what the season is
obviously I just change around the
filters and for those of you wondering I
also just use my Canon camera to take my
pictures and I have a sigma 30
millimeter lens for those of you guys
wondering I take a lot of pictures
myself with a tripod or if my sister is
willing to help or Daniel they'll take
pictures of me as well sometimes even
but a lot of times like the ones lately
I've been taking them with my tripod so
I'll just like set a timer on my camera
run pose and run back to check it that's
kind of how I do it and then as for
lighting natural lighting is the best
for pictures in my opinion and then to
get the pictures onto my phone I just
upload them to my computer from my
camera and then I will Dropbox them to
my phone so if you guys don't know what
Dropbox is it's basically just a place
where you can share photos so you can
send photos to someone's email anyways
I drop box them to myself and then I
will edit them on my phone I normally
don't edit them on my computer just
because just takes too much time if I do
I use iPhoto but that's so rare so I'm
not even gonna get into that so yeah if
you're interested in seeing how I edit
my Instagram pictures then keep on
watching also I just want to point out
yes I did over and draw my lips for
those of you wondering I did not get a
lip injection just thought I'd throw
that out there hey guys so on my
cellphone I just have all my main apps
that I use and then right down here I
have a group or like an album called
photography and that's basically where I
keep all of the apps and that I use for
pictures and stuff by the way this
picture in the background is just at the
end Fabio we're super cute huh so
basically I actually don't use all of
these apps anymore I kind of need to
delete them but I'm just lazy so the
main one that I use is square ready and
this just makes the white borders on
Instagram if you have a picture that you
want to be long with the white borders I
use this but I also use this to square
pictures so okay so it opens a picture
for me and this is a picture I just took
the other day basically it you can like
move it around and do whatever but I'm
if I wanted to square it I kind of just
do that and I save it I don't know what
the right setting is I always just press
the JPEG one save that and then I go
into this app which is called
vsco cam and I feel like everyone uses
this but here you could just see all the
pictures that I've edited before I add
that picture in and you could see that I
totally messed up it's hard to do this
one I'm like looking through a screen
but basically you have all these filters
to choose from which I don't use unless
I'm editing for my with F is Alex
account
I don't also this is a very white
picture so I do apologize for that here
I'm gonna see if I can bring the
brightness down okay that might be a bit
better for you guys okay so if I like
the filter T one what's good about this
is that you can just bring it down if
you wanted yeah that's really the only
one I like then I come into here and I'm
going to fix the square because yeah I
really messed up there we go and then
the thing I will normally do is
temperature I'll bring it down to make
it look super snowy and then I will fade
it a bit I kind of play around with it
so I'm like okay that's way too faded
I'll do this and then sometimes contrast
I'll bring that down for winter pics
basically because I want to make a very
snowy you know and then I like it like
that so I'll save that and then I
sometimes will use Pixlr for this summer
if I'm taking summer pictures I will
I'll just show you guys I'll never use
it for winter pictures but I'll go into
the subtle thing and I'll choose this
it's the filter Jeanine then I'll
usually use that that'sa been nice for
this picture save that and then the
other apps I have our Snapseed cream
come instead --it after light characters
pic frame I color tan and face tune
these I used once first selfie to make
myself look tanned and changed my eye
color and I laughed so hard I would
never post that picture oh my gosh but I
don't know why I haven't deleted the
house it's been so long face tune I use
actually this is a cool app will show
you if you have like a selfie of
yourself here I took this picture the
other day in front of like my bath full
but basically if you want a kind of
cheap alternative to take to blur the
background instead of buying an
expensive lens you can actually just use
this app so if you go to defocus you
click d focus and then you can actually
blur the background of things
like that and okay it's really hard to
pick up on camera but basically that's a
blurred background I'll insert a picture
of one that I did right here on my who
they have this who the F is Alex account
I was a selfie that I took with my phone
and I'm wearing the background it was
really cool
okay and then if ever you guys are
wondering how I get like some of those
cool character things I use this app
called characters you can like make a
moon you do so many things the heart I
just really like that and then what I'll
actually do is I'll go in onto Instagram
and if you want to follow me you can
this is my Instagram account
Alex Antonio you guys can follow me if
you want and what I'll do is I will
actually edit it through Instagram so I
don't use any of the filters but I
really like this new thing that they
have these tools that you can like
adjust things with and I just play
around with this until I get something
that I like sometimes I'll sharpen it I
don't know and when I think something
looks really cool then I'll just upload
it straight from Instagram so there
aren't many apps that I actually use but
it's so simple the way I take my
pictures and edit them that's why I
always put off from making this video
because it's so short but I honestly
just use square ready vsco cam sometimes
Pixlr and oh yeah to get like that kind
of white-washed effect that I do
sometimes I go into contrast and then I
go brighten and see how it kind of like
makes a bit of that blur obviously play
around with it till I like it but you
get the gist of it and that's literally
all I do and I need to delete all these
apps that I don't use anymore so hope
you guys enjoyed that video
if you have any other questions or if
you do you know take I know some of you
guys like to recreate my pictures on
Instagram tagged me you could use the
hashtag Alex in tomo or you can tag me
on instagram but probably using the
hashtag it's easier because then I can
actually see all the pictures
so do hashtag Alex and Tomo and I will
go through them on a daily basis and
like them and stuff and give a little
comment or whatever because it's harder
to see when people tie me because I get
tagged a lot so it'll go down whereas if
you were to use hashtags easier to see
because the less people know about that
and if you have any other suggestions
for videos I might make a video on how I
take my pictures but it's it's really
simple guys but if you are interested in
that let me know I kind of did one on my
blogging channel but that was like how I
took pictures against the white wall
maybe I'll do kind of probably take
tumblr inspired but inspired pictures
also just thought I'd let you know that
I will be in LA on Monday through
Thursday so a video is still gonna be
going up for you guys on Wednesday I
just won't have time to replied in the
comments until I get back home because
I'm not too sure how the Wi-Fi is and
everything and I don't know I just you
know I will definitely answer them but
just a bit later so don't freak out if
I'm not like answer your comments or
head away but I will be instagramming
when I do have Wi-Fi throughout the
whole time I'm gonna be vlogging when
I'm there so make sure you're subscribed
to my blogging channel because it's
gonna be so much fun
