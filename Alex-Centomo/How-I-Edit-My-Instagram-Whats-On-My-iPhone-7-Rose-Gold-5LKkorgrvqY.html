second time trying to film this video so
frustrating but basically I don't know
where I'm gonna film if you guys don't
know I moved and I'm trying to figure
out a good location so I thought this
would be good then I forgot to clean up
a background so I have like underwear
and stuff hanging in the background but
gonna do it again it's gonna be fine but
I'm just no I'm just chilling on my
couch I feel like I'm hanging out with
you guys it's actually really fun I've
been getting so many questions lately to
film a how I edit my Instagram pictures
if you guys don't follow me at Instagram
I think you should because I mean I'm
really passionate about my pictures and
it's just kind of what's got me started
in social media so I figured oh just
combine this with a what's on my iPhone
7 plus video I haven't done one of these
and so Long's I don't even know how they
work but basically this is the iPhone 7
plus that I have it's the rose gold it's
the biggest one since the 250 something
gigabyte I just take a lot of pictures
so I need a lot of space on my phone
because I travel a lot and I just I'm so
passionate about photography and I use
my phone for most of my pictures so
that's what the name main question I get
on Instagram is what camera do I use so
for my pictures on Instagram I just use
my iPhone which by the way this new
camera is incredible
I'll just don't write into it this is my
main screen this is my background
picture is a dog that I found on tumblr
I just thought it was really cute so I I
put it I know I was that weird anyways
then the apps that I have on my front
page are camera music photos Safari
settings calendar weather Instagram
snapchat Twitter Facebook YouTube Gmail
Google Maps uber that have a photography
album which I'll go through later
whatsapp then I have Kendall revolve
notes 2nd page I have plants vs. zombies
Apple store security clock reminders and
then I have like three folders that just
have a bunch of random stuff in it and
basically the apps of my front page are
the apps that I use the most so the ones
I'm grabbing to the most so uber because
as you guys know I travel a lot and um I
use uber every time I'm away if they
offer it it's just like an easy way to
get around if I'm not walking then
Kendall I have her app because when I'm
bored I like to look at it sometimes she
has some really interesting things I
love her fashion so I get very inspired
by her revolve I shop off of all the
time so I just have their app it's easy
what's up because I travel like I said I
have a lot of friends around the world
it's easy just to communicate through
whatsapp because of all of them not a
lot of them most people have iPhones but
some people don't and that's just the
free way to message each other YouTube
just to like make my videos go live or
whatever so this is my Instagram account
I just as you can see my um theme theme
for Instagram is mainly like white and
black and gray I have a few colors like
some blues and some greens now mainly
that it's fall I'm probably going to
have more color but I like to keep the
main thing somewhat white so if you want
to follow me you totally should in
photography I have vsco cam facetune
Lightroom unum DJI go snap seed and
boomerang Pinterest tumblr so unum is a
really good one because it just helps
you with the the theme of your feed so
you can actually upload future pictures
you can move them around if you want to
get like a better sense of what you want
as you can see here what I tried doing
these are the ones I've already uploaded
they have like a little Instagram logo
in the bottom corner
oh this one's twice oops let me just
delete that so I have a lot of white
pictures and I have a lot of like fall
pictures I calling them fall because I'm
just assuming green because it's like
green the picture nature so I've been
trying to do this thing where I do like
nature white nature white nature white
so this one is a nature one this one is
a white one and then it goes like that
but it's really simple to use this app
my friend Mel showed it to me then how I
edit my pictures is very simple
Lightroom is the app that I recommend
for pictures all the time I think it's
the best app out there for editing
pictures playing with colors and all
that kind of stuff I'm not like a master
at it or anything I just know the basics
I have it on my computer but I don't
really use it I mainly just use the app
it's pretty straightforward I don't know
if it costs anything I don't remember
this I got a long time ago but I don't
have any things on here because I just
got my new phone but beforehand it was
so packed I'm going to show you how I
would edit a picture so this is a
picture I took of my old Daniel took of
my mom and I in Brighton I think it's so
cute we're just like looking at each
other but basically this is just meet
uploading it straight off my camera roll
no edits nothing so the first thing I'll
do is I'll play around with the crop
because I think it's a little weird so
I'll crop that then I'll go into edit
and then I always do these steps no
matter what the picture is and then it
just depends on how much of the
adjustment I'll do based off the
lighting and stuff of the picture but I
always just do these steps first thing I
do is white balance I'll do custom I
don't know why I just do it it's a habit
then I go into temperature and I'll
bring that down a little bit obviously
if you go too much it's like really bad
but if you bring it down tiny bit it
looks nice um then exposure I think it's
a little overexposed so I'll bring that
down a tiny bit
contrast bring it up highlight bring it
down I typically bring highlights down
in my pictures all the time because I
don't really like things to highlighted
shadows I'll bring it down a little bit
White's up locks down to give it a bit
of a darker look clarity I always bring
it up a tiny bit because I love when my
pictures look very clear and crisp
then vibrance down and saturation down
always those two a little down because I
don't like things too saturated or too
colorful that's not my theme or my style
but based off of what you like to do
totally go for it if you want to be more
saturated then the fun part I go into
color / black and white and as you can
see they have all these little color
circle things so the first thing I go
into is luminance and I bring the orange
down a bit because it makes you look a
little tan which is so nice and then
I'll go into saturation bring the yellow
down all the way and then bring a bit of
the blue down and as you can see bring
in the blue down makes the picture look
more white and that is my favorite thing
in a picture is when it's a lot of white
colors so obviously I want to bring them
blue down too much because then I'll
just make my mom's pants look gray and
that will just be weird but this is
pretty good so I like the way that looks
I'll just go ahead and save that to my
camera roll in the maximum available
size so doesn't cut any quality then
I'll go into face tune and it's the
picture I was editing for now upload
this one and as you can see here they
have this little yellow stain which with
no so I'll use the white tool to kind of
just get rid of that yellow or sometimes
what is good to do is this tone one so
I'll go into picker pick the white or
the whitish grayish blue color go back
into the other thing and just kind of
color over it not too extreme
but as you can see here now it's a lot
yes less bright yellow it's better then
facetune I really don't recommend going
overboard I used to back in the day and
it's just not good pure self-esteem I'm
not going to be a preacher you do you
but just a suggestion what I use
facetune for is mainly that type of
stuff or details because I show a lot of
my outfit so I want details in them for
example here my knees am rips in them
I'm gonna go with a bit of detail over
the knees I typically go over the shoes
and then sometimes I'll do like glasses
or hair but yeah that's that's about it
I like the way the slope so I'm going to
save that then I go into vsco cam and oh
I have a few pictures of Kyla cuz she
always sends me pictures to edit and I
do one thing on vsco cam I use one
filter and that's it and it's a six so
yeah I kind of like the way that looks
bring you can bring it down a bit but
yeah that's nice so I will save that in
the actual size then Snapseed what you
can use it for i'll show you really
quickly what i use a force is the only
thing whatever use it for is selective
take the selective tool let's say
there's something in the background on
board I wouldn't do it for this picture
but for an example touch something
that's a bit too dark and you can
actually see here you can bring it
bigger or smaller and then depending on
the way you slide you can brighten it up
or darken it so that would be
brightening and that would be darkening
just a selective part of the picture so
um
if there was like something in the
background that's a bit dark you want to
brighten it up you could do a selective
tool and brighten that up or vice versa
it's really good for that I know you can
also play around saturation of things
but I'm not really sure how to do that
this is the only thing I'll use it for
that's it
DJI is for my drone in my ozma when I'm
filming it's just to be able to see what
I'm filming on my screen Tumblr
Pinterest or for inspiration for
pictures boomerang I honestly have never
used I don't even know why I have it but
that's it then I'll go into Instagram
and I actually like to use the editing
options they give you on Instagram so
I'll do the little Sun thing on top the
lux and then I will do brightness either
bring it up or bring it down warmth I'll
bring that up a little highlights
probably bring down and sharpness and
then it'll be ready to post and that is
how I edit my Instagram picture is very
straightforward pretty simple I think I
don't know based off of a lot of my
friends the way they add it I feel like
this is pretty standard yeah and then on
the second page of my phone and we'll go
through that plants versus zombies I
just have enough session that game it's
I've been playing it for years now not
sponsored just saying then App Store
obviously Spotify for music clock and
reminders for alarms and for reminders
then in my extras I have PayPal which if
most of you guys know what PayPal is I
don't you explain that messenger is for
Facebook periscope I have not done a
periscope install long I need to do that
contacts Find My iPhone Apple Store home
which I don't know what that is do you
guys know that is just came with phone
podcasts which I like to listen to
podcasts calculator Dropbox for sending
and sharing pictures or videos then this
folder I literally named it folder
because I don't know what to name it I
have my bank stuff this P thing is for
parking downtown Montreal Shazam Google
Drive you guys see it this one is travel
so things like
when I'm traveling but not really I have
like post mates because that's not in
Canada's just in the States
uber eats is for Toronto then air-cannon
Expedia are the two absolutes the most
I'm traveling documents is for saving
things reward style to pop and enormous
you wallet I never use those ways don't
really use it it's kind of useless but I
just have that on my phone yeah that is
everything I have on my phone right now
that is how I edit my Instagram pictures
