channel happy new year I know I made a
video last week all about the new year
and my like resolutions last slash my
favorites of 2016 if you guys want to
check that out I'll have a link down
below for you guys also if you are new
here don't forget to subscribe it's free
and you'll just be notified when my
videos go live so really the only way I
can start this video is by first
explaining that this is not going to be
like a follow along workout video I know
a lot of people do videos like that
where they just work out and you follow
them I'm not a personal trainer I'm not
a fitness expert so I'm never going to
be doing videos like that just because I
don't want to teach you guys anything
wrong and have you hurt yourselves but I
have been working out a ton for the past
few months if you guys aren't aware I
did go through kind of a crappy phase
into 2016 and I did gain quite a lot of
weight I mean maybe just some people
it's not a lot but for me was the most
weight I've ever gained in my entire
life I'm lucky in a sense that when I do
gain weight it's kind of like spread out
evenly throughout my whole body so it
wasn't like a massive difference but I
just felt really unhealthy like really
really unhealthy I was just always weak
I had no energy I was always sad like I
just felt like crap so I told myself
enough is enough and I became serious
about not only exercising but my diet
you guys aren't aware I was gluten
intolerant for like five years I had
been tested by three different doctors
when I became gluten intolerant and it
was during a time when like gluten
wasn't like it was a thing but like no
one no one was gluten free like it
wasn't a fad whereas I feel like
nowadays a lot of people cut out gluten
to be healthier or whatever the case may
be but I was it's not an allergy it's an
intolerance so it's being like lactose
intolerant like I'd get really sick when
I would eat it and there was no such
thing as gluten-free bread gluten free
meals like no restaurants we're doing it
it was literally like the new thing and
I just was like so hungry all the time
because I had to cut out like so many of
my favorite foods and I was
so exercising a lot because I've always
been an active person if I also just
want to quickly say before I continue
with this that this is going to be kind
of a back story so if you're not
interested at all in this back story and
like how I gained weight how I lost
weight then you can totally skip forward
I am not judging you I mean I hope you
stay so you can understand what I do at
the gym but if you guys want to skip
forward to the actual workout routine
I'll have a little thing down below
where you could just skip forward but I
do recommend you guys listening to this
it's not going to be that long I'm just
going to get into it really quick if you
want to know more details I'll link the
vlog down below where I really spoke
about it a lot but essentially I was
good and tolerant I cut it out I was
exercising all the time I lost like some
weight because I wasn't like overweight
or anything back then I was an athlete I
was a swimmer it wasn't like I had much
to lose but I was just very very
physically active and very healthy and
then this were like last year in 2016 in
like the spring when I was able to eat
gluten again I don't know how long I had
been able to eat gluten cuz I just never
tried it again because it made me so
sick but I was in Paris and I was like
I'm just going to try I saw I don't care
if I get sick like I'm in Paris whatever
and I didn't get sick it was weird so I
slowly started introducing it into my
diet I wasn't celiac so it wasn't like
that serious
my doctors did recommend that I don't go
overboard because I probably healed my
body by cutting it out and if I go
overboard it could like read a majouk
utt it out completely again so I'm just
kind of taking it slow I'm not eating
too much gluten but I did go through a
phase of like I was just like like
everything that I had been able to eat
in like five or five years I was just
like binging on and obviously gained
weight from that then I went through a
period of like not working out and that
was the weirdest thing for me because
I've always been so active like my whole
life I've always done sports I've always
like when I quit something I was like
into running like I've always been an
athletic person so for me to just like
not do anything I need like crap was
like weird and I don't know why that
happy thought it was a phase which it
wasn't
and I gained a total of 25 pounds in
like a really short period of time like
for me that's like that's a lot of
weight I wasn't pregnant like it was
just and it was unhealthy weight like it
was not like I was working out I was
gaining muscle like it was literally
just like really unhealthy fat just like
sitting on my body and I could feel it
and I just felt gross finally I was like
enough is enough Daniel you need to help
me dan has also been an athlete his
whole life he could be a personal
trainer like he's so good at what he
does so I just needed him to help me not
just in the gym but in the kitchen as
well because it was getting to be a
struggle like I I did it like I was
craving sugar all the time I was so bad
and you guys know I'm a vegetarian I
don't eat meat but I was like and I
don't crave meat but I was like eating
so many other things to fill myself
because I wasn't getting enough protein
we started working out in the gym but
not only was a giant cardio which is
what I always did I always did cardio
and I always said like Pilate type
exercises I started weightlifting and
this is the first time I've ever weight
lifted in my life like when I was a
swimmer we were supposed to also do like
dry land and weightlifting and I would
just like hide in the closet or like
pretend to do it and not actually do it
cuz I was terrified of like getting
muscular like I was like ooh I don't
want to be like super muscular and Jack
that's not my goal not knowing that it's
like really hard to look like that it's
not just like you left a few weights
you're gonna be like jacked like it's
really hard to gain a lot of muscle it's
a lifestyle so me being like 16 17 not
really understanding that I was like I'm
just not going to do any weight training
so I never did it I never knew what to
do
so dad thank him so much for like
showing me how to do things properly and
showing me how to like use machines at
the gym so if you guys are curious to
see how I work out without equipment
like at home workouts or anything like
that I will have a playlist for you guys
to check out with all my previous
workout routines because I have a lot
but this is like the one that has worked
the most for me and actually made me
lose the most weight but I do have to
say
what of it has to do with the kitchen
like a lot it's not just like working
out and then eating like crap is gonna
like make you lose weight like it's a
complete lack stop
lifestyle change so I guess we'll start
off with what I do at the gym because I
always work out in the morning it's the
first thing I do we wake up at either
7:00 or 7:30 in the morning and we go to
the gym right away
I start off with cardio because I do
love to get my cardio in I love to run I
love to like get my heart rate up and I
do think it's important to do that at
some point in your workout routine it's
not necessary but I just I just think
it's it's good so I will either use the
elliptical machine which is like the
thing that goes like this and you feel
like you're like cross-country skiing I
love that or I go on the treadmill or I
go on the bike is that what it's called
a cycle thing bike I mean I'm figuring
it's a bike which I don't really love
that much but I force myself to do it
once in a while because I don't think
it's good to do the same thing all the
time so but running for me is just like
the best so I will do 40 minutes 40 to
50 minutes of cardio and I'll do like
sets so I won't just do like the same
thing for 40 minutes straight like I'll
do 20 minutes on the elliptical and then
20 minutes on the treadmill or 20
minutes on the bike whatever it might be
but I go hard on only one of them so
let's say I start off with the
elliptical I'll like go in a really hard
level and like really push myself for 20
minutes and then I'll go and walk on the
treadmill for 20 minutes like I kind of
mix it up so it's not too intense
because then I don't want to like kill
myself and after that's done after I
break a sweat I go downstairs to like
the weight area and every day I switch
it up so I didn't film like all of the
stuff I do I just want to give you a
general sense a lot of people ask me how
I like have my butt
and that's such an opera thing caper one
I was born with a more bubble but like I
just always have had a bubble but so it
wasn't like I just said squats and I
grew my butt like it just it's naturally
more like bigger so I kind of work off
that so it does have to do like with I
do do exercises that help that stay more
up but I do have naturally a more big
booty that makes sense anyways I'm just
saying that because I get literally so
many questions about my butt so that is
the reason why it's genetic sorry but
okay so let's say it's like day
so with leg day I do machines to work
specific areas on my legs I kind of do
all around typically hamstrings glutes
quads all exercise like that and I'll do
a low weight with a longer rep because
I'm not trying to bulk my muscles to be
super big I want like long lean muscles
and that is the way to do it if you do
like longer reps but lower weights
that's how you're going to get the
longer leaner muscles so I'll do like
let's say let's say it certain like 30
pounds for me on like my legs it's like
I find it really hard just because I'm
like not that great yet so I'll do like
3 times 15 so I'll do 15 like whatever
it is like lifting my legs or between 15
and 20 and I'll do I'll do 20 of them
take like a minute off and then do it
again so I'll do the 20 reps 3 times if
that makes sense and I kind of do that
with everything so whatever exercise I
do I'll do between 15 and 20 and I'll
try to do it three times and then once
my body gets used to that I'll kind of
up it so I'll up the weight a little bit
and try to do like 22 or 25 or something
like that till like every few weeks you
could see yourself getting stronger and
it's just like the best feeling in the
world so I'll either do leg day then
I'll do an arm day where I'll do a bunch
of arm exercises
and or I'll do a back day and then abs
obviously abs are so important I'll
always end with ABS and I'll always end
with like some Pilate exercises
incorporating some weight in because I
typically have never done that before
and it's just um it doesn't do anything
bad for you as long as you keep the
right posture you have someone at the
gym showing you how to do things
properly there's nothing worse than
doing something the wrong way you can
actually really injure yourself so you
want to make sure that someone is there
telling you what you're doing is right
no one is perfect obviously even with me
when I do squats like my knees still go
over my toes a little bit when you're
not really supposed to but to gain the
muscle like I need to you know start
somewhere so um yeah I do that and then
I always end with stretches stretching
is so important because you want to like
extend your muscles it also helps use to
you're not asked or the next day and
it's just I mean I was a dancer for a
long time as well so like stretching is
just like always been so important as
well as swimming like stretching is just
like and yeah so right now my routine is
40 to 50 minutes cardio then I if it's a
leg day I do all my leg exercises three
times 20 typically and if it's an arm
day three times 20 if it's a back day
whatever I have shown it different
exercises quite often because I do think
it's important to switch things up
because your body does get used to
exercises and then it gets to a point
where it just stops Excel not excelling
it just stops improving because your
body just gets used to it and there's no
more improvement that can be made so if
you switch up your routine you do some
other things when you go back to the
other thing then you can start improving
again so that's another thing I've been
doing and I've noticed such a difference
in my body guys like it's crazy I have
like defined muscles like my legs are
trying to get defined I've always
struggled with like cellulite on my butt
and that's trying to slowly go away like
it's crazy and not only does my body
feel a lot more fit I feel inside so
much better I have like a million times
more energy I'm sleeping amazing I'm
feeling way more positive way more
better it's just like working out just
does so well for you I
commend it for everyone if you guys
don't have access to a gym you could
still workout at home like I work around
every single day but Sunday's I do an
at-home workout I don't go to the gym I
do at home
just like I literally go on YouTube and
I search like at home workout and I'll
do the workout and it's just it's just
so important to get yourself up and
active whether that be going for a
30-minute walk or just skip rope or
running around circles in your house
like just do something it's so important
it helps your like brain so much in the
whole like toning up in losing some
weight that plays you know working out
plays into that but the kitchen is like
the most important thing and this is the
thing I think from a lot of people they
struggle with because they become like
obsessed with the number on the scale
and like losing weight and whatever that
is like I don't want to encourage that
because I think it's really unhealthy
I got a scale for the first time in my
life when I moved into this house I
weighed myself when I was at my heaviest
and I usually weigh myself like once
every two weeks just to kind of keep
like a progress but I don't go overboard
because I know so many people that just
become obsessed with it and it just goes
bad I do think it's really important to
eat very healthy and not very healthy
meaning that you're getting all your
fruits and vegetables you're getting
your protein you're getting everything
you need in a balanced diet I don't
think it's good to do like portion
controlling because I mean it's hard
like I don't want to give too much
advice that like could like it all
depends on the person but I think that
when you become obsessive and you start
like weighing your food and measuring
your food and saying I'm only having
like four broccolis like that's when it
becomes mentally like wrong and like I
don't think that's healthy I mean at the
end of the day you do you but I think
it's important to as long as you're
working out like you can eat what you
want just in moderation so like I for
example eat healthy like every day I
have lots of salads offs lots of greens
lots of smoothies I have protein powder
now or protein shakes it's like a veggie
protein thing I don't know it's just
really good
and that's helping also because I don't
eat meat so like I don't like if you eat
me you can have like a piece of chicken
where it's like I can't do that I don't
get much protein with other things so I
just make sure to have my protein powder
and I'm good I have my vitamins my
minerals I have um
I drink so much water like water is the
key so drinking a lot of water eating
with pretty clean diet but allowing
myself to indulge because if I don't
then I'm just gonna go crazy and like
what's the point of that you know like
if I'm going to a movie and I feel like
having some popcorn like I'll have some
popcorn you know it's not like I just
think it's so important to like let
yourself indulge because then it just
makes you crazy and why would I want
that so if you guys are curious like
know a meal plan let me know in the
comments down below because that is
something that I would be willing to
show you like what I would eat a typical
day when I'm working out what I think is
really healthy I'm not a nutritionist so
like I can't give you like specific
advice but I could show you what I've
been doing and what works for me so if
you're curious about that let me know
and um also if you do have any comments
about what I've been doing if you think
I could do things differently or if you
have any suggestions totally let me know
if you have been struggling with weight
if you've been struggling with you know
getting yourself active comment it we
can maybe help each other if you guys
see a comment down below that you see
somebody struggling give them some
advice or just leave advice down below
look I want this to be an open
discussion and I this is something I do
want to start my channels like really
healthy living and my goal in life is to
live as long as possible so like why
would I do anything that is gonna cut my
life shorter I haven't I don't drink
alcohol I mean not that I say anything
about people that drink alcohol nothing
wrong with that but like just for me I
haven't had alcohol in like five years
um so if I want to have like a soda once
in a while like a Diet Coke or something
like I literally don't remember the last
time I've had one but like if I wanted
to I wouldn't like beat myself up about
it I don't smoke I don't do drugs like I
literally want my body to be so clean
and so good what I can
trol I just want to make sure that I
have like the most long happy life as
possible so that is my goal I hope you
guys enjoy this video I know it's a
little different than my other workout
