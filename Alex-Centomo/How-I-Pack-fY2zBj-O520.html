she packs I kind of just like take
everything I want and threw it in my
suitcase so that is what you'll be
seeing I'm only going for five days so I
shouldn't technically be bringing that
many clothes but since I will be filming
a lot and taking a lot of pictures I'm
doing different look books and stuff I
will take advantage of the beach and
bring a lot of outfits so i can show you
guys how I style everything and you know
some light look books and some how to
style bikini videos so let's get started
ok so here is an overview of my bed I
like to just lay everything out so that
I could see exactly what I need to pack

just what I'm going to be wearing on the
actual plane so i have just this plain
white t-shirt that I got from Windsor

nice and safe and then in these little
bags i have like tanning oil which I
probably shouldn't be bringing but I am

suitcase but now that I'm looking at the
size of this compared to the stuff on my
bed um hmm let's see if I can do this

down just a little bit and there's my
boyfriend suitcase he just asked me one
question why is my boyfriend suitcase
