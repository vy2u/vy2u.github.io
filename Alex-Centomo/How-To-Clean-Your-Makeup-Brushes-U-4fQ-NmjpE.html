i clean my makeup brushes and all you
really need are simple products so i use
extra virgin olive oil and any kind of
dish soap you have that is gentle on the
hands and of course some dirty brushes
these are just brushes that i use on a
daily basis then you will need a
washcloth and a paper towel just to set
them down and then you will need a plate
to put the products on so i just start
off with putting some dish wash onto the
plate you don't need a lot depending on
how many brushes you want to wash at a
time and then just adding in some EE oo
and what extra virgin olive oil does is
when you have brushes that are made from
real hair it helps keep the moisture in
place for synthetic brushes I don't
recommend using this you just need to
show or any kind of baby shampoo and
then I'm placing a cup of water so that
I can rinse off the brushes before
dipping them in so starting off with a
small brush you can see it's quite dirty
I just dip it into the water and then
swirl it a little bit into the soap and
an extra virgin olive oil and kind of
mix it together and then taking the palm
of my hand I'm going to be swirling the
brush into that and the palm of your
hand is very gentle so I like to use
this when I'm mixing the products
together
I like to get my brushes are really deep
clean so what I like to do is rinse it
off in the sink and then swirl it onto
my hand and then rinse it and swirl it
and then just repeat these steps until
there's no more suds and brush and
you're ready to dry them
after I give I brush my final rinse I
like to just squeeze out all the excess
water in the product before I dry it and
place it on the towel and as you can see
I just dry it with another cloth and
then I just place it into any position
that the brush is originally in and then
I place it down on to the cloth it's
really important to keep your brushes
wide flat to dry or upside down so that
the water doesn't run down the bristles
into the base of the brush because then
it can just kill all the glue that's in
there keeping the bristles in place and
you don't want any brussels falling out
so then just taking this flat top kabuki
brush from sigma it's quite dirty so i'm
just going to do the steps again i want
to show you guys the same process again
but with a different kind of brush and
as you can see it's very dirty because
this is what i use to apply my
foundation you can buy products that are
specifically made to cleanse brushes but
what i really like about using dish soap
and extra virgin olive oil is it works
exactly the same but it's way more
affordable and you normally have these
products at home so that's why i'm
showing you how to use it with this for
any spot treatment you can buy from back
or sephora butt for a deep clean i would
recommend this i also wouldn't recommend
you keeping your water running while
washing your brushes but i forgot so
yeah i am a horrible person please don't
judge me
so just rinsing off this brush and
drying it with a cloth and then kind of
just positioning it in the place that I
want and as you can see it's so much
cleaner yay I love clean brushes and
this one is very dirty I used to use
this as my foundation brush it is just a
stippling brush by Mac but now I kind of
use it for concealer or any cream blush
or anything like that and oh my gosh
this is so dirty you guys get the steps
by now you just rinse and swirl on your
head and then rain since role in your
hand until all the product is off the
brush and it's left nice and clean
voila perfectly clean and ready to use
next I want to show you guys how to wash
a angled brush because you don't really
want to lose the shape of the natural
arch of the angled brush so it's
basically just these same steps you
rinse in the water and then swirl in the
dish soap and the extra virgin olive oil
and then swirl in your hand of course
and then rinse and then swirl in r
instance world but when you dry this you
want to make sure that you position it
properly into the angle shape that you
want just so that it doesn't lose a
proper angle so as you can see here I
just positioned the brush in an angle
form and Pat it down before I set it to
dry
now that I have all my brushes set out
on the counter ready to dry I'm just
going to be taking some clear nail
polish to run over the writing on the
brushes just so that it doesn't rub off
because all my old brushes it all rubbed
off and I couldn't remember the name of
the brushes so this one is just my sigma
brush you can see the Sigma sign is
starting to rub off a little bit so just
by applying some clear nail polish onto
it lets it last for a long time and it
doesn't show so it's pretty awesome then
cleaning off this disgusting looking
plate with all the excess makeup and
extra virgin olive oil and soap making
it nice and clean and then these are
just some of my synthetic brushes that I
didn't use any ee oo on just the dish
soap and here are my nice clean brushes
