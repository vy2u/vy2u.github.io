a pretty requested video I've been
getting a lot of questions on my
Instagram lately on how I grew up my
hair I did a video like this in the
summer where I kind of gave some tips
and tricks but ever since I uploaded
this picture I have been getting so many
questions so I figured I would just kind
of do an updated one on kind of what
I've been doing to grow my hair out and
how do I guess grow your hair quicker so
I am gonna give a little backstory
before I start growing up my hair I used
to have hair like up to here and it was
all blond like bleach bleach bleach
blonde and super dead like dead dead
dead ends not pretty at all and I used
to use heat on my hair every single day
I would either straighten it or I would
curl it with a straightener so basically
just always using a straightener
and then I would get it cut often but it
would just keep going like this and like
I didn't understand why my hair just
wasn't growing the hairdresser kept
saying all you need to keep cutting your
hair and you're just not letting it
you're not cutting it as often as you
should and I was kind of confused cuz I
was cutting it like every three months
and like that's a lot so then I finally
figured out I finally decided okay I'm
going to stop dyeing my hair for one and
I'm going to start stop using heat so in
the summertime I didn't use heat for
like a month and a half and my hair grew
a ton and I don't know I just the past
like six months have been figuring out
like different tips and tricks that have
helped my hair grow a lot and just
things I notice girls with long hair
that they do to maintain their long hair
or how they grow their hair so my hair I
actually just cut it because it came
back from a shoot and I cut it like it's
pretty long it goes all the way past my
boobs almost touches my belly button but
it's still somewhat dead at the ends I'm
just slowly like getting a cut basically
the first thing I suggest you guys is to
stop dyeing your hair I know that a lot
of you just need to dye your hair but
I'm talking about like full-on full head
dyeing like full bleach
if your brunette and you're trying to go
blonde or vice versa
like the full the full head getting all
your roots done like pretty often I
would suggest to stop doing that now if
you don't want to stop doing that try
the ombre thing or the volley or
whatever or just like streaks not
getting like the full head dyed so
that's like the first tip is to not diet
as often
second tip would have to be to get trims
regularly but not excessively so my
hairdresser was like constantly cutting
my hair and it just wasn't growing and I
didn't know you that you need to trim
off the dead ends so that they don't
split all the way up to you and then
your hair just fall off like you do need
to get regular trims to get rid of the
dead ends like the split ends so that
they don't split all the way up your
hair but you don't need to do that every
two to three months like I talked to
girls that have super long hair and they
trim their hair maybe once every six to
eight months and that's fine but it also
depends on the person like if your hair
grows faster or not you know how fast
you get split ends it really depends on
your hair type for me I can go six
months without getting a trim and I'm
fine so I stopped dyeing the hair start
getting regular trims and my number one
rule is to stop using heat like I know
your girls need use your heat but you
don't need to use it
every single day I was one of those
girls that would literally use it every
single day ah no joke like it was
ridiculous I just embraced my natural
hair not like this is my natural hair
it's curly slash straight slash wavy I
don't know what it is some days I wake
up it looks like a lion's mane sometimes
it looks flat like it just depends on
the day I used to be really really
embarrassed about my natural hair I
don't know why cuz I love it now but
obviously if you're going to an event a
wedding or party or something and you
want to get your hair done that's like I
we do my hair for that but I wouldn't do
it on everyday basis if you have super
curly hair I have friends that have
really curly hair and there are always
hairstyles you could do if you have
super straight hair I would suggest to
if you want to curl your hair do it with
the no heat way I have a tutorial on how
to curl your hair without using heat if
you're interested I'll leave it down
below but really just stop using heat as
often as you would because the heat is
what damages your hair heat mixed would
die it's just it's not good as soon as I
stop doing that my hair just like it
grew so much it was actually insane like
I remember my roots when I started
working at brandy Melville they're just
like this like regular roots and then I
just decide to grow them out and by the
end of the summer they are like down to
here and then by the full summer after
like all my blonde was practically out
like it was ridiculous and I actually
just read I'd my hair so when I went to
my hairdresser
I was very skeptical so I was like I've
been like doing so well without dyeing
my hair and I don't want to dye it um
that often I do want to keep the ombre
in my hair so I do want to have like
more blonde because my blonde was like
if you watch my old videos it was almost
completely out of my hair so I asked for
like the Bali ash so it's like she does
streaks in my hair but like from here
down so that way it's not like all over
my head and I didn't get that much hair
dyed and then as soon as I dyed it I got
a cut so that it wasn't like super
damaging and I'm probably the next time
I'm going to dye my hair it's probably
gonna be in like 6 months to a year from
now like I'm not going to be doing it
often so I like to keep it more natural
going with that drinking a lot of water
it helps tremendously with not just your
hair but your skin and your over well
being like just drinking water is so
important
I started off like I hated drinking
water and then now what I do is first
thing in the morning I drink a huge
glass of water I just force myself
sometimes I'll add lemon or whatever
into it but drinking a whole glass of
water it just makes a huge difference in
the morning you just feel more awake
throughout the whole rest of the day and
it's just it's good for you guys so I
try to drink around like eight huge
glasses of water a day or I have like my
water bottle that I bring around with me
I just keep refilling it and we are just
drinking like crazy so that's really
important for your hair your skin your
nails everything like that water is like
the number one thing exercising and
eating healthy on just an everyday basis
helps all around so it's not just going
to be specifically geared towards your
hair but it does help in the long run
with everything so I just I've been
doing that and this is honestly these
are just tips that I give to because
these are things that I've done and that
it works super well for me might not
work for everyone but I don't know I
just that's just what's me and my hair
grow out hopefully I'm trying to like
figure out in the summer how long it's
going to be because my extensions that I
use are like really long like down to my
hips
but I wonder like which day I like want
you to use them for length you know just
like for volume I don't know
anyways so that's about it if you guys
have any questions or comments please
feel free to leave them down below I'm
going to go through them and like answer
your questions and stuff and if you have
any other suggestions for hair tutorials
let me know because I'm so down to do a
hair tutorial I've been done one in a
while and I know those are like super
requested so leave some suggestions give
