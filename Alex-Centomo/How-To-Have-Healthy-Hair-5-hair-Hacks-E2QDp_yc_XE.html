channel I've been getting so many
questions on Instagram lately about my
hair and I get questions quite often
about my hair but lately it's just been
like I think it's because it's the
change of seasons and people have just
been asking me a ton of questions about
it so I figured I would do a hair hack
video and I have five hair hacks for you
that I find really helped with my hair
making it look a lot healthier a lot
shinier shinier is that like a thing to
say a lot more shiny I also just want to
say a huge thank you to Pantene for
partnering with me on this video you
guys know that I'm always honest when I
talk about things like I would try out
the product for awhile before I even
mention it I'm just gonna start right
into the video because my interest had
to be super long sometimes and I really
apologize for that but sorry so one of
the main things that I do is once I get
out of the shower I like to do two Dutch
braids with my wet hair I start from my
ears and I just go all the way down I
don't worry about being super neat your
hair is wet so it's gonna be a little
messy and when I do this I let my hair
dry completely in these braids and when
I take the braids out my hair just looks
so wavy it's like the natural beachy
waves and you guys know when I have my
hair natural in all my videos that's
what I am done like I just Dutch braids
from hair down and a Dutch braid is when
you it's like a French braid but instead
of going over the middle strand you go
under the middle strand and I find
there's a bit of a difference there
because the waves tend to go away from
your face and I liked it a lot better
because I haven't actually curlier hair
once I get out of shower it's obviously
not super curly so if I do that I'm like
kind of forming it without using any
heat and it's great so that is my first
tip for you guys
so my second haircut for you guys comes
down to in the shower the shower is like
the most important thing when it comes
to keeping your hair looking super
healthy and the products that use in the
shower
definitely play a huge role into that so
I have been loving the Pantene 3 minute
miracle daily conditioner you guys know
have been using Pantene products for a
really long time now but this one
specifically because it's in everyday
use and it really helps to straighten
the hair strand by strand it goes in
makes it look super smooth really shiny
there's six different variants to the
actual conditioner so you can kind of go
based off of what your hair is needing
lately I've been using a lot of heat so
using that product really helps to keep
my hair healthy it's like the main thing
that I want to stress is like healthy
hair from the inside out in the shower I
just use a little bit in my palm I run
it from my ears all the way down to my
ends really focusing on the ends and the
tips of my hair because that's where
it's most dry especially when it's the
change of seasons this conditioner
specifically works in like three minutes
that's why it's called the 3 minute
miracle because it literally is a
miracle I also like it cuz it helps with
my frizzy hair even though it's the
change of seasons lately it's been so
humid so my hair normally would go like
but because of that conditioner it just
helps tame it on the being so honest I
use it every single time I shower it's
great I love it I've been using these
products now for the past year like I've
been using Pantene products and I'm just
a huge huge huge fan
so my third hack for you guys comes down
to how you tie your hair and I didn't
really know this and I feel like a lot
of people don't know this but the type
of hairband that you use plays a huge
role in how healthier hair is gonna be
so my tip for you guys is using elastics
that are made out of some kind of ribbon
or cloth material you can buy these
anywhere and I own a ton of them don't
break your ends they don't damage
anything and also what's really great
about them is they don't always leave a
mark on your hair you know sometimes
he'll you'll have your hair in a
ponytail you'll take it out and you'll
have that like weird like boom like that
I find the ribbon ones don't leave as
bad as like a mark like that and it just
helps to keep your hair protected my
fourth hack for you guys has to do with
how you dry your hair I always dry my
hair naturally I never use a hairdryer
not that there's anything wrong with
using a hair dryer
I just don't own one right now but a tip
for me is I don't wanna say towel drying
because I don't use a towel when I dry
my hair and this is actually a hack that
I didn't even know until the past I'd
say 6 months and my friends don't even
know this using a t-shirt to dry our
hair helps a huge ton I know it might
sound weird but when you get out of the
shower and your hair is wet instead of
using your towel to kind of like rub
through and dry your hair because that
actually can damage your hair you want
to use a thin cotton t-shirt doesn't
really matter what climbed in all
honesty but cotton usually is the one I
find that works the best because it
absorbs the water it doesn't damage your
hair it's really gentle on your ends and
making sure that you're not tugging at
your hair you're kind of just gently
patting it and you can even tie it up
into the t-shirt if you want I just
don't have a big enough t-shirt so I
kind of just like Pat it dry within a
month
noticed a huge difference so when I
started doing it I think it was I would
say the springtime I was really strict
with myself like only using a t-shirt to
dry my hair by the summer I was like oh
my gosh huge difference in like the
texture the quality of my hair the ends
especially it's because I wasn't tugging
at it with a towel and the fifth and
final hair hack for you guys is sleeping
on a silk pillow this might seem a
little strange
and maybe some of you guys already do it
but I never had soaked pillows growing
up as a kid I recently invested in a
silk pillow and it has done wonders I
don't have it just the way I sleep at
night if I'm like moving around like
crazy or something but I would wake up
in the morning and you have seen from my
previous get ready with meetings like
years ago my hair was like a lion
recently it's been looking so good and I
think a huge part of it has to do with a
silk pillow definitely keep that in mind
because when you sleep it does tend to
pull and stuff like that these are all
little tips and steps that I just really
think have worked for me and I thought
that like I could help you guys out
doesn't mean you have to do it but I
figured like why not show you guys
because I do get a lot of questions
about it and maybe if you guys tried
some of these out or if you guys do them
already let me know how it goes or let
me know how it worked and if your hair
is looking a lot healthier than normal
so I hope you guys enjoyed this video if

other tips for making hair healthy if
