channel I am deciding to film a video
today because a lot of you have asked
how I pack for a trip when I just bring
carry-on and kind of like how I do it
how I fit everything in there how I
bring my toiletries and all that kind of
stuff so I'm actually going to Mexico I
leave Friday but by the time you see
this I think I might already be back I'm
deciding to just bring carry-on I'm
there for around a week and it's easy
when you're going for a like beach
vacation because obviously the clothing
for a beach is way smaller than like
sweaters and jeans but I have done it
before where I've gone to Europe which
is carry-on it's hard but I've done it
basically first step rolling all of your
clothes so they are a lot smaller and
kind of just compacting everything
together
so this is my carry-on luggage this is
the inside of it the outside of it this
is by Samsonite I did not was not sent
this I actually bought this at a random
store here in Montreal so I don't always
can find this but basically I really
like be hard keeps lines because they
just feel a lot more secure inside
they're pretty heat and they have these
two things that go over and cover so
let's get into the video okay so the
first thing I like to do is kind of just
lay everything out that I want to bring
out supplies and kind of figure out also
what I'm going to be bringing on the
plane like to Blair because that also is
like I could wear that on the trip as
well so this is kind of how I organized
it I have to kind of oversized tees I
could wear with shorts that are more for
like walking around during the day
whatever just chill I have to crop tops
that are more nice so I think would be
really cute with high-waisted shorts
then I have all these shorts that I'm
probably going to wear so to denim these
high-waisted pair of like regular fabric
shorts I have this really oversized
great either I like to wear over my
bikinis to the beach then I have PJ's
here I don't know if I'm going to bring
these or not these are just an extra
pair of like loose shorts
that's like a maybe if this all fits
after bathing suits I'm bringing it one
bikini that's like more pretending
have this fun bikini and then this
one-piece and those are all the bikinis
in raining I'll just rotate those then
here I have three different rompers for
dinners or for the shoot they're all
kind of patterns and different so I
thought that would be really neat then I
have my workout clothes because
obviously we use the gym
then this is just a drawn over it's like
an oversized dress shirt over my bikini
or some shorts or you know whatever kind
of thing I just think this looks good
and then I have two pairs of shoes these
are just for the beach slash walking
around I have these for dinner and then
I also I'm going to be bringing my
running shoes but I'll wear those on the
plane so this is everything on the brain
clothing wise and I think that's the
best way to do it just like lay
everything out I'll probably also bring
this thing that I'm wearing and
obviously socks and underwear and bra
let's can't forget that except very
important but I always throw that on top
of everything so you'll see that in a
bit umm then the first thing I like to
do is figure out in my suitcase I have
this section here that has these two
things obviously when you bring up the
little handle and then this one's flat
but what I like to do here is kind of
stuff my sock just in between these
little grooves or any kind of like
jewelry accessories because then it's
going to make a flat by putting all like
little things in here and that way when
I lay my clothes it kind of fits
properly so I'm going to go grab some
socks so all my socks and underwear and
bra let's are kind of pushed into the
groove so now this is like a flat base
so I can kind of start rolling my
clothes and put them all in order so
that it all fits I always start with
like the wrong curves and t-shirts and
then move on to the smaller thing and
then shorts loft bikinis I usually put
into like a slip thing I mean you'll see
so everything's kind of rolled in there
I'm going to put the flatter stuff like
my shorts because I don't want to roll
them just on top as well as my bikinis
and then jewelry and this whole sign
will be done so I just put my jewelry
bag in here with a little headband as
well and then I like to wrap up my shoes
because I just want to protect them
basically
okay so I know this might look weird but
I actually used like men deodorant right
now because a Daniel has this and I just
I think it smells really good so I call
in makeup over white razor an extra hair
elastics hair brush that's gonna go in
here and long as well as my makeup case
I just have like a bunch of travel mint
goes in here and my GoPro he goes well
and this is my toiletries so I have just
like sunscreen I have this like tanning
lotion for like my face basically actual
body cream I have perfume face
moisturizer purple shampoo face wash dry
shampoo all the kinds of stuff and
normally this is going to go on my
backpack but I'm not bringing backpacks
and rain my drone so I'm going to put
this well is it so that is how I pack my
carry-on I have extra batteries and
stuff and I'm going to put in here as
well actually I don't bring any hair
tools because I don't do my hair when
I'm at the beach but that is how
everything fits in perfectly if I have
any extra clothes I have a lot of room
so I could just kind of fit it in but
yeah everything fits really well
actually I'm really proud of myself
you'll go throw on this little cup clip
right here my drone backpack have some
extra pockets so if I like forget any
last-minute things I can throw them in
there
and I do also bring like advil and like
grab all and stuff in case of feeling
like motion sickness because you never
know when you go on like boats and stuff
what that is essentially in it as well
as this shirt that I'm going to throw in
a second so I hope you guys enjoyed this
video if you did make sure to give it a
big thumbs up let me know if you guys
are traveling anywhere soon I really
want to know where you're going if
you're going anywhere this summer if you
