it's too fake I know what's up everyone
so I'm here today finally filming one of
my most requested videos and it's a
self-tanning video and I know that like
everyone on YouTube is now doing their
holiday themed videos and all that kind
of stuff but this is just for some
reason super requested and I figured it
was a good time to do it because I mean
like we're all especially where I'm from
it's snowing so it's not like you can go
outside to get a 10 so I think
self-tanning is pretty awesome I don't
know if it's picking out on camera but
because I mean my lights are super
bright but I did self tan and in a lot
of pictures on Instagram I'm very tan
and everyone always asks me oh my gosh
how are you so tanned and let me just
put one thing out there I am by no means
a professional when it comes to
self-tanning
I honestly don't do that often I'll do
it if I have like a big shoot coming up
or I'm gonna be taking a bunch of
pictures or if I'm like going to an
event and I want to be a bit more bronze
but I do not do this on like an everyday
basis or in every week basis I am
definitely not soft self-tanning that
often just because I don't know how good
it is for you I know that there are so
many self tanners out there on the
market that are like organic and like
have all natural ingredients in it and
that are okay for you and that I do know
that a lot of beauty gurus on YouTube
use those on a daily basis but for me
personally I just I don't know like I I
don't know too much about it but you
guys are always asking questions so I
figured I would just give you as much of
the knowledge that I know about it and I
also just want to say that by no means
does being tied to make you more
beautiful you are beautiful with any
color skin you have it's not a big deal
some people just prefer being more
turned and I find because buying from a
part of the world where it gets super
cold so I get very pale and like my skin
kind of gets
see through if you know what I mean so
you can see like all my veins and stuff
and sometimes I look sick like people
asking me if I'm sick or if I'm tired
and I could be like super awake and
stuff so I just find sometimes like
going out whatever going to an event a
wedding a birthday whatever it is New
Year's I love just to be done because it
looks like I was just on holiday and it
just makes me happy so just a personal
personal preference just thought I would
throw that out there because I just
don't want to like offend anyone you
know let's get into it so myself ten
routine is like the most simple thing
ever before you decide to put any kind
of self-tan on you you want to make sure
that you exfoliate beforehand because
the self-tan it clings to dead skin
that's what gives you the pigment is
that it clings to dead skin so if you're
not taking off all the excess dead skin
that's on your skin that's on your body
it will cling to it and just make it
very like patchy and not natural it's
gonna look really bad trust me I've been
there I usually like to self tan at
night and then I'll sleep on it and then
kind of rinse it off in the morning so
the first thing I do is I take a shower
at night and I have been loving this sea
salt exfoliant from lush I have talked
about this before in some previous
videos I just just picked up a new
package because last night I ran out it
looks like this smells like this is my
favorite smell in the entire world it
smells like the ocean but like so good
oh my gosh I love this it's natural it's
good for you I find it does take off all
the dead skin without being too abrasive
because I have sensitive skin so when I
use products that are definitely more
tough on the skin I tend to like get a
rash or whatever so I just find this
stuff it's like so amazing it smells
amazing and it lingers on your skin
edits it's great I love it now on to the
self 10 I know that there are so many
self towns on the market and I just I'm
the kind of person that I'm not very
picky when it comes to that kind of
stuff like I literally went to Sephora
and was like this is my skin tone I just
want a self tanner that's very dark and
that's going to
nicely and they helped me so that's all
it was
I actually used to use in different sub
times but that was a bit more orange
based personally the best self tan is
something that's more of the green toned
rather than like the orange yellowy tone
because you don't want your tongue to
come out looking like orange and like
super baked because I just do not like
that look so the one that I picked up
from Sephora is the say chop a dark
tanning cream now I know you can get the
tunning foam and there's a bunch of
different ones but I personally like the
tanning lotion the best I used to have
the foam and that one does apply easier
and it does dry quicker but it's not as
like deep as this one I just really like
the way that this turns out on my skin
I've tested out a bunch of different
ones and I think this one is the best so
far also I need to stress before you try
out or before you buy any self tan you
want to test the patch of it on your
skin similar to see if you're gonna
react to it because if you're gonna have
an allergic reaction obviously you don't
want to buy something that's bad for you
like it's very natural-looking as you
can see like it's not too over-the-top
but it's just like a nice glow as if I
spent like a few days in the Caribbean
or something and I just really like that
and for some reason my stomach gets a
lot darker than anywhere else on my body
and it just makes your abs look amazing
so even though I don't have like the
best ABS it makes it look like I have
more ABS so that's why I like using this
what I do is after I exfoliate and I dry
myself off you want to go in with a
moisturizer but you don't want to
moisturize every part of your body like
I said before the tanning lotion will
stick to dry skin now since you just
exfoliated you're not gonna have much
dry skin so it's gonna be very even so
whatever you apply it it's going to
apply evenly but there are parts of your
body that get very dry very easy like
your elbows your heels your hands just
places that like tend to get more dry
you want to put a little bit of lotion
on that beforehand so I would suggest
putting a lotion that doesn't have any
scent to it because the alcohol in that
lotion will basically disintegrate the
the counting ocean so I really like this
one it's just a V no it's a natural
normal one and I put a little bit of
this on my hands on the heels on my
elbows anywhere any other place that I
tend to get more dry like my knees and
stuff because you definitely don't want
to have like super super dark black
knees like and it looks funny so I've
definitely moisturize and then once that
is somewhat dry I will go in with the
tanning lotion and I just use this tiny
mitt yes it's disgusting and dirty
I literally just use this last night
basically just a minute I got it at
Sephora and I'm sure you can find this
at a drugstore as well it's just because
I got it when I bought this and I just
do like one to two pumps and I'll
usually start off with my legs because I
like to go from bottom to talk because
I'm bending over so I find if I apply on
top and then I bend over it kind of
creates creases like in my stomach and
stuff so I start with like my feet and
my ankles my legs I work my way up and
then I get to my stomach and then I do
my arms and I find like the best way to
apply it is I literally just that's
what's the best thing about the glove is
you can like form it to your body so I
literally just rub it on my arm like
this and I do section by section and I
would suggest using a glove because if
you don't your palms are literally gonna
turn this color and it's gonna look
really funny I don't apply this to my
face just because I have very sensitive
skin like extremely sensitive skin and
it just breaks me out like crazy I know
you can buy self-tan for your face but I
just basically use my foundation and it
works fine everyone just thinks I like
went on vacation and they're like wow
your skin is amazing oh my gosh like
where did you go and I'm just like to my
house you know also for your back I'm
really bad at doing my back so sometimes
I don't even do it but if I'm wearing
clothing that's gonna like have an open
back or something like a nice dress I
will usually get like my boyfriend or
something to do it for me you can also
buy things that's like an extendable
thing that you can literally like reach
behind you but I'm just really because I
can't
I don't know I'm just bad at that stuff
so then once that's applied you wait
around a minute to maybe five minutes
before you put any clothing on that's
just for the lotion if you get the
mousse or whatever that Joy's like in 30
seconds but I like to wait like around
five minutes to make sure that
everything is completely dry because I
don't want it to like rub off on my
clothing or on my sheets so once that's
dry I will put on my clothes and go to
bed and you normally want to wait around
minimum eight hours for the tanning
lotion to set into your skin so
sometimes what I'll do is I'll wake up
in the morning I will like get ready or
whatever run some errands come back I'll
rinse my body just a rinse that's all
you need and then I will come out of the
shower and pat myself dry and the
tanning lotion will have set into my
skin like as you can see what I like to
do during the day is apply a kind of
body lotion that has a glow this one's
from Bath and Body Works is my all-time
favorite I love it not only does it
smell amazing like it smells like it
smells like you're on vacation it's like
coconuts and tropical smell but it's
basically just a bronzing lotion that
has shimmer in it this is called fo
wahoo by Bath and Body Works um I
believe it came out in this spring I
don't know if it was limited edition I
believe it is but I bought like five of
these because I was so obsessed with
them and I'm sure they'll come back with
them again you're glowing and it just
looks super nice throughout the day and
I love wearing white with it especially
because it really makes it pop so that's
about all I do for myself ten it's
really simple I'm gonna be starting my
holiday videos next week so starting
