hair is just driving me crazy guys like
actually doesn't crazy what's up
everyone so I have been getting so many
requests lately a bunch of emails on my
fanny mail account and just a lot of
tweets actually asking how I got started
on my youtube channel and kind of just
tips and tricks on being successful on
YouTube and I remember back when I was
starting my channel that I would
actually search for these types of
videos because not that like I would
into it being like I want to be
successful but more just like I wanted
to tip through other youtubers
experiences and there wasn't a ton of
videos like this I feel like I could be
that person that I was searching for
back then and if I could help you guys
out in any way that makes me happy I
think the number one net rule for me
before starting out a channel is to do
it because you like it not because it's
the trendy thing that to do or all your
friends think it's cool and you think
okay well I guess I want to fit in so
I'm gonna start a channel because that's
not what you want to do when you're
starting YouTube channel you want to do
it because you love it and if you don't
love it in a building audience they're
gonna be able to tell and they're just
not gonna be interested because they're
gonna see that you don't really like it
number two would be do videos that you
like making again don't make videos just
because they're popular because you want
to get more views because that's not
what it's all about when I started my
channel I didn't even know that what the
whole community was about like I
literally did it because I loved it and
people made fun of me for doing it in my
real life like everyone made fun of me
but I still did it because I loved it
and I made videos because I loved them
if there's a trend going around and
people want me to do it but I'm not
interested in it I won't do it and I
usually tend to do videos that I like
watching like I love watching get ready
with me videos I love watching hair
tutorials I'll just make them and vlogs
of course I'm obsessed with watching
bloggers so I have a login channel now
the third thing I have to suggest is if
you're getting more into the whole like
business side of YouTube which I
actually didn't even know existed when I
started my channel a lot of people still
don't really know too much about it you
guys know that are youtubers tend to
promote different brands and you know
talk about different products and stuff
to show you guys and there are different
companies that will reach out to me and
ask me to promote so-and-so or promote
this and promote that and they'll send
it to me to test out and you guys know
that I'm always 100% honest with my
opinions if I don't like something I
won't mention it in a video because I'd
rather just not talk about negative
stuff and if I do like something then I
will tell you guys about it because I
actually enjoy it and would purchase it
myself if you're finding it like hard to
contact companies or you're not getting
as many companies there's actually this
thing that I discovered quite early on I
think I had around like 20,000 followers
at the time or 20,000 subscribers it's
this company or this platform called
grapevine and they kind of asked I think
the closest thing I could say it's like
they kind of act as your manager so or
like your agent if you were in actors so
basically they have like content
creators which are the youtubers and
then they have like the brands and like
the companies that are searching for a
certain type of youtuber to do a brand
deal on their product or whatever so
what grapevine does is they will be in
contact with the brands and then they'll
contact the the youtubers or the content
creators of who they think would suit
most to this brand or if they're
interested in them or what this brand is
looking for so they'll contact them and
say hey so-and-so is looking for a
specific video talking about this
product would you be interested and then
if it was me I would say well I want to
know more about the brand both of LA and
then if I liked what they were you know
talking about and I think that I would
enjoy the product and that I think you
guys would enjoy the product and I would
say okay like have them send it over and
then grapevine what they do is they
contact the brand they get all the
information they kind of send it to me
and they kind of act as like I said
before your agent so they they kind of
are like the mediators between the two
of you and they're actually able to get
you work that you want to be able to get
on your own let's say because you are
new and you are starting out and I think
it's just a really
great idea just to kind of like get your
name out there because grapevine will
actually promote you to the different
brands as well and that actually helped
me a lot so I think that if you guys are
looking into starting a channel you are
already doing it because you love it
you're making videos that you love and
then you want to start getting more into
the business side of it that's when you
would come to grapevine and they would
help you out in that sense and they
really really did help me out like I I
actually found that they've done so much
for me and another thing that's great is
that like let's say the brand did send
over something and I actually didn't end
up liking it like I was like no it's not
for me I don't like this product and
obviously I'm not going to make a video
about it so grapevine takes care of all
that for you and you're not forced to
have to do anything that you're not
comfortable with and you they always
make sure that like you are comfortable
100% with doing something let's say it
was like forever 21 forever 21 wanted me
to mention this hair brush and said that
this hair brush did this and this and
this so the first thing I would do is
make sure it does this hair brush do
that and that oh it does okay so I'll
talk about that and it really does work
and that's the thing is that like you
can tell when a youtuber is not being
honest you could tell any youtubers
doing something for money you could just
tell when something is 100% sponsored
and that really I guess bothers me in
some ways but when it comes down to it
grapevine at least in my personal
opinion it could be different for other
people but I just found that it wasn't
that way with them like they make sure
it's all like it's all in your core kind
of like it's what you want to talk about
it's how you feel about the product so I
don't know I think it's a really great
idea if you guys are starting out I
wanted to get more in the business side
of things
if you're curious at all links down in
the description if you guys to check out
because on the website it gives you
obviously way more detailed than what
I'm saying right now but that's just
another thing to look out for and then
another thing that's kind of in that
realm would be like a network a network
is something that you sign with so you
were to sign with a network and they
kind of do the same thing whereas they
like hope get you work but they also
help and get your name
out there and I think like that's the
biggest issue with people that want to
start YouTube is that they don't know
how to get their name out there and that
was like I think one of the things for
me I was like what do I do to like
promote myself how do I make myself
stand out and bring viewers onto my
channel because I don't know how to do
stuff like that and they kind of help in
that sense so joining a network early on
can help as well these are just options
for you guys you don't have to follow
these steps at all this is just kind of
what worked for me so if you if you know
someone that was successful on YouTube
but then do these like that's it's not
like a step by step thing like you need
to do these things and you will be
successful like these are just tips for
you guys that have worked for me but um
another thing I would have to say tip
number five is be consistent being
consistent is the most important thing I
tell this to my sister to Karina to
Katharine like I say I tell everyone
I've even talked about it with other
youtubers and stuff that being
consistent is like probably the most
important thing because you're building
that connection with your followers
you're you're building that like trust
with them that they know that you're
gonna be there every single Wednesday
and Saturday at these certain times like
that's just the days that I upload but
they know that they they have something
to look forward to if you kind of upload
here and there every few months
you kind of get forgotten and you're
gonna see like the subscribers are gonna
start falling and they're just gonna be
like you're your channels dry like I'm
not I'm just not interested and I think
that being consistent is so important
because you you keep on top of things I
guess that they just like look forward
to your videos and it kind of builds
that connection in that way another tip
I have tip number six is the six note
whatever yeah I don't know but the
another tip I have is to get your
viewers involved because that builds
again it's about building a relationship
this is a two-way street it's not just
about me I like
to do things that make you happy I like
to do things that make me happy but I
also like to build a kind of
relationship with you guys because I
feel like we all are friends if as weird
as that sounds because right now I am
just talking to a camera but I know that
you guys are gonna be watching this and
for me it's just like oh I'm just gonna
be talking to my friends later today and
then when I get to read your comments I
don't always get to reply to the
comments because I get busy but I do
read every single comment and I see
every single tweet I see every single
comment on Instagram guys like and it
just makes me feel like we are friends
and it makes me happy because I don't
know I think the Internet is a wonderful
place for this kind of stuff that's why
I do like every single month or every
other month I'll do like a Q&amp;amp;A video
because I like that I ask you guys
questions that you want to know and then
I answer them and it's kind of like
getting to know me on a more personal
level and I think that's like really
important when you're building a channel
you want to get more personal with your
viewers because that just helps you be
more relatable I guess because there are
youtubers out there that are just very
like top top top top you know like they
have like points and it's I don't know
for me I like to be more like I like to
feel like we're actually friends and I
like to feel that you guys are here with
me and I'm talking to you guys right now
as weird as that sounds but yeah that's
another thing that I'd have to say and
another just tip is just making sure
that you have time put aside to film and
edit your videos because if you're gonna
be sticking with a schedule you want to
make sure that you take time out of your
day sometimes during the week that you
film your videos and that you have time
to edit but I'll usually do is I'll film
like a few videos in one day depending
on what kind of videos I'm doing and so
I'll be like okay Tuesday of next week
is my filming day and I'll film all the
videos that week and then I will edit a
little bit afterwards or the following
day and another tip I have and I don't
know if everyone does this I know that
people that do YouTube around me kind of
do this is I upload them as a scheduled
upload let's say I upload every
Wednesdays at 3 p.m. Eastern Standard
Time
every Saturday at 10 a.m. Eastern Sun in
time so let's say I'm uploading
Saturday's video I'll upload it on
Friday as a scheduled video for Saturday
at 10 a.m. so that way it goes up
exactly at Saturday 10 a.m. and I don't
have to be like rushing like oh my gosh
my Internet's work not working I don't
know how to get my video up oh my gosh
it's gonna be late like and stressing
about that because I like to keep it on
a certain time so I just make sure that
I upload it beforehand and that way I
don't have to worry about it I know 100%
it's going live at this time and that
just makes it more organized I'm just a
very organized person so that's just
kind of like what I have to say about
that so I think those are all the tips I
have if you have any of it let's say
you're a youtuber and you're watching
this let me know if it helped you in any
way if you have any other questions feel
free to leave them in the comments down
below because I know I feel like we can
help we can all help each other out so
that's honestly all I have to say if
you're interested in starting a channel
go for it don't let anyone tell you it's
weird or it's uncool if you like it and
do it who cares what people think that's
all I have to say also I need to stop
touching my hair I have this weird habit
of always touching my hair and you just
stop because it's drives me crazy when
I'm editing my videos and I'm I
apologize to you guys if it drives you
crazy crazy if it drives you crazy when
you're watching my videos because it
definitely drives me crazy so if you did
enjoy this video please give it a big
thumbs up because that means a lot to me
