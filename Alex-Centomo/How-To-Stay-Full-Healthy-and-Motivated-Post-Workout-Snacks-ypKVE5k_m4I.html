channel I again have no makeup on I'm
sitting not sitting I'm standing here
with my vlogging camera because I just
finished at the gym and I just got this
idea in my head because I get so many
questions from you guys about like how
is it that you can like eat healthy and
stay full for a long period of time and
what do you eat when you come back from
the gym and all that kind of stuff so I
figured I'd kind of give a little
rundown of quickly what I do at the gym
and I'll also have links down below for
videos of me working out the gyms you
can kind of get a sense of like what I
do and stuff my routine is changing a
little bit because I believe in
switching up your workout routine not
very often but like every few months so
that your body can kind of I don't know
cuz like my body my body gets used to
things really quickly so once your body
starts to kind of plateau with what you
could do you either want to like add
weight or add reps or make it harder but
I personally like to switch things up so
like working on different muscles doing
different exercises all that kind of
stuff so I might do another workout
routine video for you guys and I also
wanted to do a video kind of about how
to workout and how to stay motivated if
you don't go to the gym because
obviously I don't believe that you have
to go to a gym I just really like it but
I didn't always used to like it so
anyways first thing I like to do when I
come home from the gym is grab my
protein shake so I either drink just a
protein thing that I get from Costco or
I make my own protein shake and that's
usually because Daniel makes his and I
just like take his anything that has
kind of like a protein in it protein
basically is the slowest releasing form
of energy in your body so it helps you
staying full it helps you to stay full
for a long period of time or a longer
period of time that's why protein is
really important there's also a lot of
other benefits to it but the main thing
about it is that to stay energized and
to stay kind of on track I do that and
typically that keeps me going until
lunchtime I would say depending on when
I workout because I wake up at 7 every
morning and go to the gym and I'm
usually there till around like
now it's 9:30 that's usually what I do
as for like snacks because I get so many
questions about this like I did a what I
ate video like a few weeks ago I'll have
that link down below you could see like
recipes and stuff that I make that are
super healthy but still delicious and
keep me feeling full for a long time but
making sure you're having a balanced
thing in your diet because I used to be
the kind of person that I need to eat
like constantly throughout the day like
I would have like five small meals and
be set but then when I moved out and I
started cooking I started realizing that
I can't eat I mean I could eat five
small meals but I was always out doing
things and you're not always able to
like have five small meals especially if
you like work 9:00 to 5:00 and you only
have a set lunch break and it's like all
that kind of stuff I realize it's really
hard so my tip is to make sure that your
main meals are super healthy but then
also to make sure that you have snacks
on hand that you could eat in between
meals that can keep you going and keep
you energized for right amount of time
and don't have you like running for like
the coffee or like for the caffeine or
for the energy drink it can give you
energy like you want to have good
nutrition in your body so that you could
feel as energized as possible for as
long as possible and feel as good in
your body as possible I tip for me is
any kind of like snack bar I'd say and I
say snack bar because it can be a
granola bar it could be a protein bar
anything like that something that you
can like it's package that you could
throw in your purse or your bag and just
have it there you don't have to worry
about anything that's like my favorite
thing because it's for one less time
consuming and two you don't have to
worry about like storing it in a
specific place you just like have it in
your purse and like anywhere you go if
you're like out and about running
errands and you're like you find
yourself to start being really hungry
but you're like oh my gosh dinner is
only in like two hours what do I do
you just got your little snack bar with
you what a great angle guides isn't it
I'm so sweaty I need to go into the
shower like ASAP but a main thing that I
just want to stress is that I really
believe in wholesome really natural
ingredients I
to put foods into my body that are not
so processed don't get me wrong because
I really enjoy meals like that like I
I'm not gonna lie like I really do like
those meals and I do let myself have
them everything in moderation I don't
think it's too I don't think it's wrong
I don't want people to feel guilty if
you guys have like fries if you go up
for dinner and you have pizza or
something like that like I don't think
there's anything wrong with that but for
the most part like I'd say 80 and 90% of
my diet is very natural in a sense of
like I usually cook all my own food and
everything that I put on my body is like
pretty much natural in a sense so that's
what I want to talk about these specific
bars because these ones it's like I call
them the no BS bars because everything
in them is like right there like you see
it and yeah so basically are there the
are Xfire so this one is actually my
favorite for one cuz it's pink but it's
this one is I just really like it's the
mixed berry one and I usually like bars
that have some kind of fruit in it
that's just my personal preference but
they have like in the box in this box
specifically looks like this there's 12
of them and there's three different
flavors so you have all three of these
this one is the chocolate sea salt which
is Dan's favorite and then the peanut
butter chocolate which is my mom's
favorite because she really likes the
peanut butter ones and I'm pretty sure
Carla likes those ones too Carla's my
sister for those of you I don't know um
show it to her she's starting a youtube
channel again but yeah as you can see on
the packaging itself and like big
letters these are the ingredients
there's no BS and in all of them it's
basic it's all like the same kind of
thing for the most part so this one says
three egg whites six almonds four
cashews two dates no BS and that's what
I call them the no BS bars just because
I think it's funny and these are just
protein bars they're gluten free there's
soy free no dairy no added sugar and on
the back it like gives you all of the
information you need per bar there's 210
calories now I just want to stress I
don't agree with counting calories like
I don't I mean really depends on the
type of person but I think you really
need to be in like a really strong
headspace to be able to do the whole
counting calories thing I think it's
to be aware of what you're putting into
your body calorie wise but remember that
calories don't equal fat like calories
is just a form of energy that you're
putting into your body so if you are
active and you're working out or you're
doing a lot of things that work that
entitle you to like move your body a lot
really don't worry about it I mean
obviously don't have like five Twinkies
every night you know something like that
but as long as you're pretty much aware
of like the basics of calories it's fine
just don't go overboard with like
everything you measure an account and
it's like because then it starts to you
know be a little unhealthy but I think
210 calories is a really good amount for
a protein bar especially of this size
like it looks like this and this keeps
me full for a really long time I really
like the taste of it like I I love all
of these but this one is my favorite cuz
like like I said I just like things with
berries in them and I like the taste I
believe there are a total of like 11
different flavors but what I really like
about it is that you can really taste
all of the ingredients like you can
taste the fruit you could taste the nuts
you could just taste the dates and
everything just I really like it so
personal preference but I think it's
great plus rx bar is hooking it up for
you guys because they're awesome
so for 25% off your first order just go
to our X bar comm slash ilex see and use
the code alex c at checkout and that'll
tell you to get the 25% off but yeah I
just I really really believe you don't
need like 2 to 3 cups of coffee a day or
how much coffee you drink like I am with
people that like they rely on caffeine
and coffee to like survive the day like
that's how they say it first of all with
enough exercise you'll sleep better at
night because your body is gonna be
exhausted from the working out you'll
sleep better because you're getting a
good rest not just like oh I'm exhausted
from sitting on my chair all day at work
and I'm just so tired because it's a
different kind of sleep your body's
actually like resting and recovering
throughout your sleep so you're getting
a better night's sleep I've said sleep a
million times I'm so sorry but that's
just really what I mean and then by
sleeping more you'll be less tired
throughout the day
in a sense of life you would have had
proper amount of rest so then when you
are like kind of feeling a little bit
lower after your meals and it's you know
throughout the day and you're feeling
tired you just have a little pick-me-up
with something like this this helps me a
ton like I don't drink coffee I feel
like I don't need any of that kind of
stuff this is just really it just really
helps me and making sure I'm eating
wholesome eating well putting all the
nutrients in my body that I need think
of your butt and I say this all the time
think of your body as a machine you need
to give the Machine the proper energy
and power to be able to perform properly
right so for your body whatever you're
putting inside of your body is being
transferred somehow into a form of
energy for you to be able to like
function properly so there's like such
simple steps that you can take to make
your life a happier and better place
exercise in any kind of way whether
that's long walks
whether that's whatever it is to get
your body moving and active sleeping
better which will help once your active
eating better which will help with so
many different things and drinking a ton
of water all these steps will help you
feel so good and once you start to feel
good you'll start to enjoy what you're
doing more and it just it's just the
pathway to a positive healthier life and
I just really want to help motivate you
guys because to be honest like I've been
through really really hard times in my
life I've talked about it a bit on my
channel in the past but you guys know
I've struggled with like really really
really hard times I've struggled really
bad anxiety um I I was thinking of
making a video about this kind of like
what happens when I go through harder
times because there's obviously
difference when you have like mental
when you have a mental disorder versus
just feeling you know down and stuff but
I really feel like I can when I like
motivate you guys it helps motivate
myself as well so I feel like we're kind
of this team of like helping to motivate
each other because I see how much you
guys comment being like Alex you're
helping me so much I feel so motivated

just really want to get on to like this
