channel I first want to say a huge thank
you to all of you guys for all of your
support on my last two videos I don't
know why but it's been like such
positive feedback I'm so many nice
positive comments and not that you guys
aren't positive all the time cuz you
guys are but it's just like an
overwhelming amount and I don't know I'm
just like really grateful for it so
thank you it's so much before you into
this video I just want to say I'm just
gonna like talk about what I'm wearing
because I always say at the end of the
videos and then they get a million
comments about what I'm wearing in the
video so just so you know guys I always
put it in the description but for my
friends this is Tiger mist this is
princess Polly okay we're good so from
my last video you guys really seemed to
like the idea of me kind of splitting up
my back to school series with a not
random but a different kind of video in
the middle because a lot of you guys
aren't going back to school and you just
want to see like other content from me
Plus that just needs more videos and I'm
just like so in the mood to start
throwing out more videos to guys again
it's been a while I've been doing one
video a week for like a few months and I
used to do two and I miss it so as you
could see from the title I a like don't
know why I say that because I hate when
youtubers say that but I'm this is all
about travel you guys know I have been
traveling a ton this past year and it is
a huge reason why my wedding has been
kind of put off a little bit because we
had not had time to organize anything
but finally now that we're home for a
little bit we have time but one of the
biggest questions I get is how do you
only pack carry-on because I always talk
about that in my vlogs how I traveled to
all these places and I just bring
carry-on and I'm talking like Europe
during the cold months and having to
bring sweaters and jackets and all that
kind of stuff there has been once in a
while if we are gone for like more than
two weeks then down and I will either
like share a big suitcase or something
but typically I like to travel with just
carry on because I'm always paranoid
that the airline is gonna lose my
luggage it's happened to me once before
and it sucks so much I just don't want
to take that chance
I'm a very anxious person and I'm a very
anxious traveler like what about the
destination it's fine but I just I would
I like to be prepared and know that my
stuff is gonna be fine
I'm gonna give you guys a few tips and
tricks on how to travel for a pretty
long period of time bringing whatever
kind of clothes need to bring in just
carry on form so this does not include a
carry-on plus a check luggage like this
is just strictly carry-on and I'm
telling you guys once you're able to do
this you're gonna thank me later because
you're gonna be able to pack so much
stuff in a small amount of space and
just be able to not stress about having
your stuff being lost and I know there's
probably ton of you guys that are like
oh my god I over packed so much and I
cannot think of just pack and carry on
but that feeling when you're on vacation
you're like why the heck did I pack all
this crap when I have not even touched
half of my suitcase that is going to be
fixed so let's get started the first
thing I want to talk about is the type
of carry-on you guys are bringing so I
have this like black carry-on that I
have from away luggage and it's really
sturdy it's really lightweight but it's
also one of the bigger carry-on versions
they have two different versions of
carry-on they've like the small one and
then like the bigger one and that's
thrown I have so as you can see it's
basically the length of my body when I'm
sitting down but it fits so much stuff
and it still fits all the rules and
regulations for traveling with carry-on
so it fits most US airlines I fly to and
from New York very often or LA and it's
totally fine like I said it's sturdy so
with all the wear and tear like lugging
it around throwing it up in the bin
bringing it down all that stuff no
scratches doesn't dent its and because
it's like a hardcover nothing can like
it doesn't get wet everything inside
just stays perfect and that's what I
like about it and that's so important
for me when I'm traveling another really
great feature about this kind of
suitcase there is a place to charge your
phone so I don't know those ever happens
to you guys but sometimes I'm traveling
and all the outlets are being used by
people charging their phones and they
don't have like a charging station and
your phone is at like 10% I leave
you know you could charge your phone
with your luggage and that comes and so
much handy for me it's very convenient
when you're sitting down at your gate
and you don't want to have to like walk
around and find something it's just
right there so one full charge of the
suitcase equals five charges of your
phone they charge your phone your
friends phone you don't have to worry
about having to recharge it when you get
to your destination it lasts for a
really long time the compartments in it
are really spacious so there's its two
sides which I really really like but one
side there's just like the mesh outside
and the other side actually is like a
thicker compartment so that when you do
put stuff in there it kind of holds it
all together and keeps it safe it keeps
it in place so the suitcase itself is
super light so everything that you put
in your suitcase it's not like you're
adding a bunch of extra weight that's
already heavy suitcase there's also a
removable kind of laundry bag that you
can wash and stuff like the inside
lining of the suitcase can take it out
wash it so it doesn't get you know
sometimes your clothes get full of sand
if your other kata Beach and then you
put it in a suitcase it's full of sin
this one you could just take it out wash
it super simple and another great
feature is that there is a lock on top
so that you can put your own code in so
only you are able to open it and it's a
really smart thing because many times
I've heard stories of things being
stolen and it sucks I don't know why
people do that look why do people steal
things my investment cat got her boot
stolen at a library once like she took
off her boots for five seconds to study
and someone stole her boots and it was
winter like who does that like why why
steal guys I just not get it anyways and
the last great feature that I want to
talk about is the fact that they have a
lifetime guarantee warranty so if any
damage happens within your whole entire
life they will send you a new one so
that's great to know I also wanted to
let you guys know I do have a promo code
for you guys to check out it'll be
listed down below in the description and
also have it right here so you can go to
away travel.com slash Alex E and use the
code Alex C at checkout for $20 off it's
pretty simple to pack for beach
vacations especially if you're just
having like bikinis and throw overs like
for the beach and shorts and shirts and
all that kind of stuff
and I did a video like that for spring
break but what I wanted to really
discuss in this one is how to travel for
places that are that have a colder
climate climate a colder climate so
obviously you guys know rolling your
clothing items helps but when it comes
to sweaters my biggest thing is really
pack smart like picture the outfits you
want to wear when you're there and then
kind of cut down things so for example I
usually bring around three to four
sweaters because I'm obsessed with
sweaters and they can all very different
shapes sizes either their cardigans or
throw over sweater or a hoodie anything
like that I usually pick three to four
and once I have them picked I'll roll
them up put them in my suitcase and then
when it comes to jeans I usually only
bring two pairs of jeans so one dark and
one light denim that's it so I can kind
of interchange and if I do go to like a
dinner or something I can wear my black
jeans because that can still you could
still get away with that being somewhat
fancy and then as for booties I like to
bring one pair of booties that are kind
of like my everyday type of booties that
I could wear throughout town if I'm in
Europe or something and I'm walking
around I want some nice sleek booties
that are daytime but that can also be
worn at night and then if I do know that
I'm gonna be doing something that's a
little bit more fancy I'll usually bring
a pair of heels maybe but a lot of the
times I'll just wear my booties like it
just happens and it's the style right
now so why not and I'm not gonna be
going to like a ball so it's fine and
then obviously sneakers I wear those on
the plane and that's another thing is
wearing an outfit on the plane that's
comfy but you could also wear again when
you're traveling so that takes care
usually of one side of my suitcase all
the clothes and the shoes all they're
like underwears bra let's all that kind
of stuff and then the other side I bring
my toiletries so I put all my toiletries
in like a ziplock kind of compartment
that has like bubble wrap in it so that
nothing breaks and all the times I'll
put like my perfume and stuff in there
too making sure everything is under 100
milliliters you guys know that's the
rule with flying with just carry on
under 100 mils so you can actually buy
those like clear containers at any kind
of drugstore you could just fill up your
shampoos and stuff if I'm staying in a
hotel I want to
that because I know that they offer it
there if I'm doing Airbnb or something I
will make sure to bring it or I'll just
buy a travel sized thing when I'm in
Europe and then I'll bring usually like
chargers or any kind of extra thing will
go on the other side and anything else
that I think I'll be needing when it
comes to technology or accessories like
belts sunglasses jewelry typically it
doesn't fill up the whole thing so
whatever space I have left I'll either
leave it free so that if I do buy
anything when I'm away I can just put it
in my suitcase or sometimes I'll be like
okay that sweater that I want to bring
that I took out of my options I can now
fit it in my suitcase and then
everything fits and it works out so well
you just really have to make sure that
you're gonna be smart about the way you
travel because I know it's really hard
when you want to bring so many things
and take so many pretty pictures and
wear all your favorite clothes but you
have to be smart when it comes to
traveling and especially if you want to
just bring carry on making sure you kind
of plan your outfits or something like
that you know or be okay with rewiring
certain things and I'm totally fine with
that like re wearing the same true jeans
every day completely cool sneakers and
booties interchanging completely cool
and shirts bring a lot of lightweight
things three to four sweaters you're
good to go everything fits so I hope you
