boyfriend Daniel again and the last time
we filmed a video together was the
whisper challenge
do you remember yeah yeah okay so as it
was for challenge and I got so many
comments on that video to do the how
well do we know each other as well as
the boyfriend Thai but I've already done
the boyfriend tag even though it was
like two years ago or something when you
just had to answer questions about me
but it's like super boring so maybe a
little redo that I don't know depending
on what you guys like but anyway so um I
got so many requests to do that video if
you don't know what it is basically
paper plates and cool quit why don't get
cool hwhip make it cool but basically
you just fill up the plate with some
whipped cream and then you ask each
other questions and if you get it wrong
you just kind of smack it on their face
but you're not gonna give a warning
you're literally just gonna do it so did
you think of your questions I'm like
really nervous are you nervous no I'm
gonna get at least one wrong spot
I feel like you're gonna get them all
right like I'm not good at thinking
pushes you for sure gave really hard
ones if they're like impossible though
I'm coming skips you have option to skip
what I haven't I don't know make sure
they go from harder than easier so now
you can go for it like I asked the
question that occurs what's here for you
two
that's what Michael up to speak so what
food did I hate as a kid but I'm like
obsessed with now all right that I
really like now
is that real
probably looks like my favorite food is
a kid what you didn't like it
what chickpeas no look there's barely
anything oh my god it was so nervous
okay so I put it but I think I think
harder to use it like artists to use it
like this so like first question is some
artists fun like is it like really hard
like you there's no me no it there's I
can no it's all things that I've said
before likewise when we first started
dating probably okay who is my favorite
superhero keep if you have more than one
I have one favorite a girl I'll give you
like an estimated like what I think but
don't do it yet so I'm gonna give my
final s after so it's between like is
that what I'm one of the shoes that made
you I can't wait did you like the Hulk I
like rich mean like though I know the
Hulk is like your favorite favorite one
though because you always talk about the
whole beat your favorite superhero is
even a superhero even wash your Iron Man
okay I'm gonna go
what is it the century what the hell is
every time I say that you say yes I do
like the whole quite he's not my
favorite is he even a superhero the
whole the century yes I've shown you
pictures what is he he the superhero

I'm told I've said that many times don't
put a lot I got all over my slipper what
year did I start watching YouTube videos
like not just like a random cat video
here and there like we're watching with
following yeah like like let's say
Beauty videos
that's nice
what was the name of my first pet cat I
did for sure we talked about it at my
house a lot I know your mom had a cut so
we had a cat when I was a kid and
because I was allergic we set it up like
socks at home
Twiggy I don't know my cousin Kathy was
tweeting you shadow Shh oh I knew that
what was my favorite show as a child
like favorite show of all time
really
how do you not know that what was it duh
and then just talk about it last night
no no but I do like the fraida are you
pretty dark yeah but like Mormon I was
like 9 and 10 that's still a kid I know
but like throughout my whole childhood I
had Sailor Moon posters in my wall
Halloween I was always Sailor Moon what
event did I win a medal at Nationals in
oh my god I just told you not to give me
this it's not a best time and I've said
this many times no you haven't you want
so many medals no not a relay like a an
individual medal but with event did I
win a medal in you've only won one medal
yeah in one event seventeen
either I am your backstroke or freestyle
200 I'm not saying anything you have to
give me a final answer twins I am okay
that's not fair you wipe it on my face
for like ten seconds I tap you you're
not having you're pretty breaking mine
oh my god
there was 1500 breeze what you want a
medal at 1500 fries your time I don't
remember
I got a bronc Wow when I was a kid I had
an imaginary friend what was her name
and what did she make me do never sissy
actually make you why
- maybe but not lie like I used to link
break things it makes me sound like some
psycho child didn't you say that used to
like she told you to blame it on Kylie I
would blame it on her
oh yeah you'd blame it on the friend
over like I do I would like break
something and I'd be like yeah sissy
made me do it yeah okay what is my
favorite season what
this one's easy it's a one in four
chance I don't know
winter house it's not winter you love
winter it's summer why would it be
summer you are always so excited when
it's Christmas and it's your birthday
and we go to the cottage I like
Christmas but summer is my favorite why
because you don't have to shovel and you
don't clean your car and you don't swear
Jack I feel like if I would have said
summer you would have said winter I've
wrote it down on my phone I thought you
were gonna get this one right but maybe
not considering the last question what
was my absolute favorite movie as a
child that I would watch over and over
again there was a few that I really
liked but there was one that I was
obsessed with and I would always watch
it and we have yet to watch it together
neverending story is that your final
answer
yes that's like the worst answer ever
boy this hiking
but I thought we watched that together
in it I thought you were gonna pick
either a lot in their line here or Jesus
Christ Superstar no I was gonna say
Caspar or liking but we've watched
Caspar
