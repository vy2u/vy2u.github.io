channel
I feel like I need a new intro this is
so annoying as you guys may or may not
know if you follow me on any form of
social media or if you are subscribed to
me
I was recently in Hawaii for around 2
weeks my boyfriend and I went to Maui
and Oahu and it was just like such an
amazing experience but if you guys watch
his blogs dan actually daily vlogs which
we daily blogged our whole trip so I'll
leave his link down below if you guys
want to check that out but I was saying
a lot how my skin was just breaking out
like crazy and I didn't understand why
and I was just like normally when I'm in
the Sun it actually helps clear it up so
I was just very confused because it was
going crazy and I realized it's because
of all the traveling we were doing we
were on so many planes especially on the
way home we did like 5 flights or
something it was it was crazy like I've
never been on that many planes ever in
the span of like two days craziest
flight home but since we were like
traveling so much and doing so many
things and on so many planes you guys
know that the air is very dry I have dry
skin which causes me to break out
because of an excess of like clogged up
pores because of all the dead skin cells
I was able to really help kind of clear
that whole dryness out and help
replenish my skin and everything and a
lot of you guys were asking me because I
posted on snapchat how I was able to do
that so quickly and like what products I
like to use as you all know I have been
working with origins for a long time now
they are one of my favorite brands ever
I was buying their stuff at Sephora like
years before I started YouTube so I've
been a huge fan of origins for a long
long time and I actually partnered up
with them to try out some products so
they sent me this amazing thing which I
actually want to talk to you guys about
because it's incredible I can't even
explain it it's something that I've
never even heard of before so it's gonna
get right into it it's a face mask
primer that might seem a little bit
weird or whatever but it's actually the
world's first face mask primer and it's
by origins it's called the mask miser
that's gonna cool mask oh miser skin
optimizing mask primer it's in a cute
little blue bottle house like a really
cool like detail on it I don't think
it's gonna pick up on camera but look at
this color like imagine your eyes are
this color do you guys know anyone
eyes are actually this color like in
real life because that's freakin awesome
and this is now available at Sephora
which is really exciting so if you guys
have a support near you which I'm sure
most of you guys do you should
definitely check it out so this actually
just preps your skin for like enhancing
your mask experience so it helps soften
condition helps prepare your face for
any kind of mask that you're gonna put
on although I do have to say I wouldn't
recommend peel-off masks cuz that's not
good this is for like any other mask
that you put on it works for any mask
it's good for all skin types it really
helps to hydrate the skin which is
something that is very important to me
because I have very dehydrated skin and
overall just helps skin be more
receptive to the actual mask itself also
the Lighting's a little bit crazy right
now because I'm obviously using my
window and the sun's going in and out of
the clouds
so all you have to do is if you've ever
used a setting spray on over your makeup
or on your skin it's basically the same
thing so you hold it halfway of arms
arm's length I'd say in front of your
face and you're gonna spray it I sprayed
it around five times you just want to
make sure that it's evenly coated all
over your face and then you're gonna Pat
- just like rub it in and make sure that
it's evenly distributed you don't want
it to dry though because the whole point
is to have your skin kind of a little
bit more dewy and wet so that way when
you put the mask on it really helps
apply it really evenly and smoothly and
you can actually feel a difference when
you're putting the mask on over the
primer it just feels a lot more like
hydrating so you can actually enter to
win a fun Maximizer kit of your own by
just simply entering your email @ww
origins com slash Maximizer sweeps and
there will be ten winners so that's
really exciting and also if you want to
check out the product I will have a link
listed down below in the description
like top line so you guys can click
check it out let me know what you guys
think I freaking love this stuff it's so
awesome by the way the masks that I'm
actually using today is by origins as
well because origin masks are my
favorite I sound like a 12 year old boy
going through puberty right now oh my
god it's just really annoying my voice
so this is called drink up it's ten
minute mask to quench skin's thirst you
guys know I'm all about that because
obviously my skin is very dehydrated
especially in this time of year which is
winter I came back from Hawaii so my
skin was all nice and glowy and pretty
all over my body
I get to the cold and it's just
instantly flaky all over my body so yeah
so just making sure I'm washing my face
twice a day because that's very
important for my type of skin and using
the mask and using the primer very
important I think this is something you
should definitely check out and
definitely try out because it's really
awesome and if you use face masks which
I do recommend for everybody because I
just think it's a really luxurious thing
to do to your face at least once a week
something that can help either unclog
pores can help replenish the hydration
in your skin there are so many different
masks my favorites are from origins you
guys know I've talked about them so many
times and I just really like that
company I actually started buying
origins products because of Ingrid
Nilsen
years ago like four or five years ago
because she would always talk about the
checks-and-balances foaming facial wash
and I bought that and fell in love
instantly so I've been like buying all
of origins stuff like yeah okay they
send me things once in a while but I
also go out and buy them once they run
up so I hope this video answered any of
your questions that you guys had about
my skin and if you do have any other
questions or if you're concerned about
your type of skin and this these
products let me know down in the
comments below I will go through and
answer as many as I can and don't forget
to give this video a big thumbs up
because that makes me super happy I love
you guys also so so much and I will see
you guys all in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
