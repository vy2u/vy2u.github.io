channel so I have decided to sit down
today and talk to you guys about
something that is probably my most
requested thing of all time and that is
about my hair now I have done so many
videos like this before explaining like
the history of my hair how it was so
damaged how I did damage it how I
overcame that damage and how my hair
started growing but recently on my
Instagram post I've been getting
hundreds of questions from you guys
asking how I keep my hair looking very
shiny how I keep it looking healthy
without like my split ends how do I
avoid that and also how do I keep my
hair looking this color and not like
yellow it might look a little strange on
camera just cuz my lighting is so
awkward right now but like if you watch
my blogs if you follow me on snapchat
Instagram all that you'll know that I
have more of that like white blond
rather than just like yellow blond I
wish it was coming off cross on camera
better I mean I don't know I'm kind of
far from the camera right now but I mean
you guys know what my hair looks like
there are a few products that I have
been experimenting with for the past I'd
say a month and a half maybe two months
now that I have been really really
liking and have I think have made like a
really big difference in the overall
feeling and look of my hair and I think
you guys have picked up on it because in
my vlogging channel and my snapchats you
guys are all talking about my hair and I
just get so many questions about it it's
like what I'm known for like when I go
for jobs and stuff people are like okay
go ahead your hair we know all about
your hair and were just like okay thank
you guys so much I'm so glad you guys
like it it's such a compliment for me
because for so long I was subconscious
by the way I'll leave the links down
below for the old videos that I've done
if you want to know the history of my
hair and stuff right now I'm gonna talk
about the products that I've been using
and loving and how I use them what's
good about them all that kind of fun
stuff little background also if you
follow my blogging channel you'll know
when I got these products set to me to
try out I've got a lot of things sent to
me I don't have P o box but I thinking
of opening one because I do get a lot of
things that are sent for me to try out
and I only talk about the ones that I
actually love like seriously love it and
will continue to use for a long time so
these are the three products that I'm
going to talk about today because I
absolutely obsessed there by the brandy
salon so there's three right here
there's a hair mask which is incredible
there's a leave-in conditioner which
I'll get into later there's also this
which is a color enhancing treatment
it's called tinted love and this is what
keeps my hair looking less brassy as the
word I want to use I guess I'll start
off with the thing that I've been loving
most which is the tinted love color
treatment product this stuff is purple I
don't know if you guys can see right
here it's actually a purple treatment
because I do dye my hair blonde so a lot
of times like this is my natural hair on
top right here this is all my natural
colors so if you're gonna put bleach on
this if you don't treat it it's gonna
turn yellow after a while that's just
what happens and especially since I
don't dye my hair often I dry my hair
once or twice a year like literally do
not dye my hair often so to keep that as
much as I can that more white color
rather than that like super yellow color
if you look back on like my old videos
from last year you'll see how yellow my
hair was it was disgusting so this has
really helped with that it's kind of
improved my color and everything which
is great because if not good so I'm
really glad that I bought this sent to
me because I can talk to you guys about
it now and I feel like a lot of you guys
would love it
it also adds a lot of shine to my hair
which is great because I am very not
shine here I don't know that just like
with blondes in general like what are
curly hair but just usually doesn't look
that shine but lately it's been looking
real shiny which is great so this is a
temporary color treatment so it does
repigmentation it intensifies it tones
it does a bunch of things especially
this one because I have the purple one
but they have a ton of different shades
and colors I believe they have 20s so
it's for like all hair types and what's
great about it is that there's no
ammonia or peroxides there's no harsh
chemicals which actually is really bad
for your hair and when I go
the hair salon that I go to I'm very
strict of like what they use in my hair
so that's just something that I look out
for so it does add a little bit of color
so if you're blonde brunette redhead
anything it will add color so it's
perfect in between like treatments keep
like touching my hair it's perfect in
between like sessions that you go to the
to get your hair done at the salon if
you do get it done at the salon also
with this product what you do is use it
in between shampooing and conditioning I
use it twice a week I don't know if
exactly that's what it says I literally
haven't even read the back of the bottle
I've kind of just gone based off of kind
of how my hair reacts to it and I think
that's the best way for you guys to do
it is to you know test it out a little
bit on like one piece of your hair see
how it works and then kind of go from
there I do not suggest work using this
every day I don't think it's pure hair
cheese it every day but every you know a
few days once a week twice a week is
probably the best in my opinion that's
just what I think and the ingredients
actually will help strengthen your hair
which is really good because I had very
like brittle hair you know that's that's
my struggle and also what I like about
this brand is that they have a team of
like stylist so if you want you can
actually call and you can like talk to
them and they can actually give you
guidance and recommend the proper
products for your hair type and stuff so
that's really cool and they're nice
enough to give you guys a discount so

gonna be discount so definitely check

that's the first one I feel like I've
gone into like crazy detail about this
but this is like my favorite one I think
out of them just because of like I've
always struggled with my hair turning
yellow so so the next thing I'm gonna
talk about is the comb perfect ending
leave-in conditioner it's very very
lightweight and it does not like it gets
rid of frizz that's where does look
before thank you because ok not so much
in the winter but I travel a lot and I
go to a lot of tropical places and my
hair is very frizzy and you know when
you have
curly hair and you brush that hair and
it turns into triangle hair for you guys
that up curly hair you know what I'm
talking about this helps so much with
that oh my god I can actually brush my
hair and it not frizz up like that like
miss Frizzle from Magic School Bus this
stuff is great so it helps hydrate the
hair which is obviously I need that
because I mean my end you looking really
good right now
cuz I just had a trim but like when I
let them grow ooh girl those ends and
it's great because it does hydrate it
without weighing it down which is very
very important to me because there's
nothing worse than having your hair feel
flat like this that usually happens like
this is actual third day hair and it is
not greasy that's how good my hair is
being because I wash it I've gone to the
habit of washing it like once or twice a
week even though I do workout I use dry
shampoo on days this is actually my hair
with no product in it so it doesn't get
his greasy anymore I used to go greasy
like by the end of the day I would wash
in the morning and we get greasy at
night and sometimes I actually use this
it's like the next day care like if I
you know like a day like today if I
wanted to look more smooth I'll put it
in even when it's a little bit dry you
know just acts it's like a nice
nourishing cream since it's very
lightweight it doesn't feel like like
it's weighing my hair down and then it's
heavy it's amazing so obviously with
leaving conditioner you shampoo your
head and then you get out of shower you
towel dry it I do not recommend rubbing
your hair I recommend using like either
a white t-shirt to dry your hair it's
not towel it's at a cloth that I put in
my hair so that it doesn't damage or
break my ends and once it's like a
little bit dry from the towel or cloth
t-shirt whatever you take one a dime
sized amount of that and you rub it in
your hands and then I start from my ends
and I work my way up you can put it all
the way to your roots I usually stop
around here just because I have so much
like what's worth called like nourished
hair near my roots I really need to
focus it on like the dyed part so that's
really where I focus it and then on to
the last thing which is the hair mask
it's called deeply invested nourishing
hair mask
hydrates and softens hair helps
strengthen and repair damaged strands
and boosts healthy-looking shine these
things are actually very true I use
probably a hair mask once a week I don't
know if that's what's recommended but I
use it once a week
doesn't really say how often to use it
on here but I think using it it depends
how often you style your hair I never
ever use heat like it's very rare use
heat like maybe twice a month maybe um
but if I do use heat I'll use the hair
mask more just because I feel like the
heats like just so jab damaging but for
someone that uses heat on a regular
basis step 1 don't do that anymore stop
doing that and step 2
use something like this to help protect
your hair because or help replenish it
because it's just gonna be so damaged so
especially if you dye your hair and you
use heat on it often not good what I do
is I shampoo my hair and then once
that's rinsed out I will put this in
instead of a conditioner I will use this
instead so I put this in starting from
my ends working all the way up to my
roots and I'll leave it in for around 10
to 15 minutes I say 10 minutes is good
but I like to leave it longer just cuz I
feel like my hair is extra dry and extra
damaged from like just years and years
of being not smart with my hair but I'll
leave it in for a long time I've kind of
like shaved my legs wash my body thing
or something I don't know
just kind of keep myself occupied for
those 10 minutes and then I rinse it out
and it feels amazing it smells really
good I'm really bad at explaining sense
it's just like a fresh scent that's all
I could say it's very fresh it doesn't
smell like anything in particular I
really like a sentiment though and yeah
I just feel so good in my hair
afterwards and I go the shower it feels
so like volumous and fresh and soft to
the touch
I always air dry my hair so I don't know
if like blow-drying makes a difference
because I've personally never done that
but it does contain argan oil shea
butter
it contains seaweed extract and that
actually helps with antioxidants and
like adding them to your hair yeah I
really really like that another
recommendation I have is if you are
going to get your hair treated like
you're gonna get it dyed use this
beforehand like obviously you want to go
to the hairdresser with dirty hair just
cuz like the color of gold's better if
you have like your natural oils and it's
not freshly cleaned but like the wash
you do before hairdresser use this mask
you can use like a hair cap put on top
of it let it steam for five minutes like
whatever you want
that's it's just a really good idea to
use something like this really helps
with damaged ends and all that kind of
stuff helps renourish and everything
like that so I say if you have any kind
of color treated hair use something like
this to add extra color extra shine help
maintain the color throughout your
washes and then obviously a leaving
conditioner something really good for
detangling all that kind of stuff adding
shine and a hair mask is something that
is I recommend to keep this is all
things to keep your hair looking good
after you've kind of gotten out of that
really bad hair face and if you're still
in that light really like my hair is so
damaged then take the steps into working
towards making your hair healthy so if
you are interested in how I grew up my
hair I'll have links that list it down
below as well as if you are interested
in getting 50% off these products I will
have links for all three of them down
below with 50% off coupon coupon I don't
want to say it coupon code for you guys
in the description make sure you check
it out and like honestly so grateful but
I try these products out because they're
freaking amazing I'm not just saying
this guy's like you know how 100% honest
I always am with you guys
because I don't ever want to come across
as like that fake person that just
promotes anything for money like I do
not like that I can see right through a
person when they're doing that so I just
feel like I'm only gonna promote new
products that I genuinely like I'm gonna
be 100% honest like yes these were sent
to me but I will repurchase them because
they're frickin great so just take that
in mind that I would never sell to you
anything that I don't actually like
because what we the point in that
because then you just lose trust in me
and then why would I do that so anyways
I hope you guys enjoyed the video if you
did give it a thumbs up if you have any
other suggestions or you want and if you
have any other questions about my hair
