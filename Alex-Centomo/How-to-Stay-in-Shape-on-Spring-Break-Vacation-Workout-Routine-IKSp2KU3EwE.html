channel I am currently trying out a new
lens right now so I apologize if you do
hear the shutter noise thing because I'm
kind of testing it out and I just need
to have it on auto focus right now just
because long story short I don't know
what I'm doing so if you guys have been
following me for quite some time you
know that I was recently in Hawaii and I
get so many questions about my workout
routine and what I do to stay in shape
as you guys know I'm very passionate
about working out staying healthy
staying in shape all the kind of stuff
and I do travel a lot so people always
ask me how do I you know stay on track
while I'm traveling so much and so I
kind of had the idea to film a workout
routine video that's perfect for when
you're on vacation and you don't have a
gym I mean you can do this anyways even
if you're at home and you don't want to
sign up for a gym so these things are
perfect you don't need weights you don't
need anything it's just very quick and
simple to do in the morning every single
morning you can do it and I know spring
break is right around the corner so I
thought this would be the perfect
opportunity to post a video like this so
I did film it while I was in Hawaii and
I do want to say that I have since then
been trying boxing and it is so much fun
I really feel like boxing is gonna be
like my new obsession I've been doing
ballet for a long time but boxing is
just something that gets out so much
stress I just feel so badass when I'm
doing it so if you guys want me to do a
video all about boxing and where I do it
what I like about it benefits about it
let me know also if you are new to my
channel make sure to hit that subscribe
button which is just right there or here
for you
I don't know which sign it's the red
button and that just lets you know when
my videos are coming out so let's just
get into the video so the first thing I
like to do while I'm on vacation is
probably just look at the scenery
because usually it's so beautiful then I
make sure my hair is tied and I like to
start off with cardio so either running
or like skipping or jumping jacks or
something light like maybe for 15-20
minutes nothing too extreme and then I
like to stretch out my legs I know I
look a little bit ridiculous right now
but I think stretching is really
important after I run because it makes
sure that I'm not sore for my next
exercises
then I move over to the ground I use a
towel for this because you don't need a
mat when you're on vacation you are
always supplied with towels and what
I've been doing lately is something
called valet beautiful a lot of the
Victoria's Secret models do this all the
time or even they do it intensely like
three months before the show like the
Victoria's Secret Fashion Show it is
seriously the hardest workout you will
ever do I am not kidding you I die so
you can watch the free versions on
YouTube I will link some down below that
her killer seriously try them out and
tell me if you can do the whole thing
because I honestly wanted to kill myself
like I thought okay this looks easy
she's so relaxed she's so calm whatever
it's no big deal um my legs were shaking
I got up from the mat and I actually
fell down on my butt so I've been doing
this for the past like three months now
usually every morning sometimes they're
doing at night but I'd like to do it
early in the morning and I think it's
perfect for when you're on vacation
because all you need is just your phone
or your computer basically just internet
so you can watch the videos but as you
can see I was dying so she has her butt
workouts her leg workouts but she also
has her arm workouts and I know I look
kind of ridiculous but it actually hurts
so bad this workout it helps tone the
arms and it's really really hard so I
would definitely leave all of those
links down below try them out and let me
know in the comments on this video what
you think of them because holy crap you
guys are good and it incorporates like
simple ballet moves with like actual
toning exercises and stuff so usually
after every exercise I do I like to
stretch out my muscles because it's very
important to keep the muscles long while
you are working them out so that they
don't get too sore afterwards cuz that's
the worst I do not like being that sore
and it's just so peaceful to like look
out on location while you are on spring
break or anything for like you know 30
minutes before you start your day it
keeps you energized and everything I
actually also started boxing lately but
obviously you're not going to do that
vacation
and then I like to kind of just dance
around and be crazy because after my
workout I'm usually feeling great then I
like to move on to my ABS which is
really the challenge right now it's
actually really good if you have a
partner and Daniel usually likes to hold
my feet so that they stay straight on
the ground cuz as you could see my core
strength is not strong enough to keep my
feet completely on the ground so usually
he will just come hold my feet or
something but this is also one of the
exercises that is shown in ballet
beautiful guys this is not sponsored by
ballet beautiful at all they have no
idea I'm doing this I have just been
doing their things lately and have been
dying it is so painful but so good works
every aspect of the muscle obviously do
it to your degree you don't want to hurt
yourself so just keep that in mind you
don't want to like do it excessively
take it one step at a time that's what I
was doing
then once that's all done I like to just
kind of dance around I did dance for a
long time when I was younger a lot of
people asked me this yeah I did ballet
and stuff and I was also a competitive
swimmer for majority of my life the
dance has always been just an expression
of mine and something that I just
enjoyed doing and Daniel always laughs
at me but I seriously do this all the
time when I'm just like with friends and
stuff and I'm hyper I love it so I hope
you guys enjoyed the video I had so much
fun filming it I actually had done my
workout like right before we filmed that
and I don't know Bally beautiful it's so
hard
I'm just letting I'm just saying it
again guys like they are not sponsoring
this video they have no idea making this
video I honestly found them because I
know that's what the Victoria's Secret
models do before the show and stuff and
it's seriously hard I will link videos
down below go try them out and then
comment down below on this video if you
were able to do them or how your butt
and legs or arms felt afterwards it's
it's a challenge it is definitely a
challenge but I hope you guys enjoy the
video nonetheless give it a big thumbs
up if you want to let me know if you'd
like to see more workout routine videos
because I do love making them for you
and if you have any other suggestions
feel free to leave them double in the
comments I love you guys all so much and
I will see you guys all next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
