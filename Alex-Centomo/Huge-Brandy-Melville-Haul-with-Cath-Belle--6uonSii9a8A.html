Katherine Orlov Katherine Bell here on
YouTube she does YouTube videos as well
she's known for her hauls so that's what
we're gonna be doing today is a
collective haul and basically what a
haul is it's just like things that you
have bought recently over the past
couple of weeks and just you know a big
collection of clothing that you feel
that you should show people else do you
describe a whole display it yeah look
what I bought it's pretty cool though
because then you can kind of get to see
other people's wardrobes and their style
and what they like to wear and sometimes
you can get inspiration from that so
yeah basically we're gonna be doing a
haul and then I'm gonna be posting her
channel down below so you guys
definitely go check that out and give
her some thumbs up on her videos and
also at the end of the video I'll just
make like a link that you can click with
her channel which will be pretty cool so
yeah let's just get right into it go for
it
so basically a lot of our things are
from brandy melville obviously because
it's her favorite store ever and it's
just the best I have a couple everything
upper of a cup of a couple of other
things from other stores but basically
this whole haul is Brandi and I mean why
not awesome
so we'll kind of go like back and forth
like well I'll show something and then
she'll show something and just like that
so do you want to start sure why not
okay so the first thing I'm going to
show you is this bright orange top like
this so it's a little crop top and it
looks super cute with high-waisted
shorts or just anything high waist and a
skirt anything like that and it's
adjustable straps in the back and I just
think it's perfect for a spring and
summer such a cute color yeah I really
like the color so you're 10 likely I
can't wait to go so I got a lot of
graphics in this haul the first one that
I got is this tank top that says you
can't sit with us and if you guys are
familiar with the movie Mean Girls then
you'll know exactly what this is quoting
because I love that movie such a classic
it's like
really classic it's just one of those
things that like every girl sees this
and they're like I know where that's
from that's awesome
and it's just funny and like it's
obviously it doesn't mean like you can't
sit with us like my mom when I sure do
this she's like that's so mean why would
you wear that but like it's it's I don't
know it's just something that like most
people know what it is so it doesn't
actually mean like you can't sit with me
or anything like that just funny to
where it's very and I also like it cuz
it's really like soft and flimsy and
it's just like oh it's so comfortable to
wear
brandy melville is like known to be
everything is so soft yeah one thing I
love about it and it's really good
quality - and we're affordable so it's
just it's amazing because you're
practically paying forever 21 prices but
you're getting amazing quality exactly
and it lasts a long time
totally agree this other top I got is
very basic it's just a nice white top
it's really really flowy which I like
and I think my favorite part is the back
because it goes down pretty low and if
you guys are familiar with the CHEO tops
that they saw a little bra let's I have
like lines in the back it looks amazing
with this and I just love wearing this
with like a necklace or anything like
that just like this mark it up a little
bit but it's a really good piece I think
it's like a little classic you can get
from there so yeah look I really like
their top a lot of wines like it a lot
of colors - yeah exactly so the next
thing that I'm going to be showing you
guys is another graphic and if you're
watching this and you're young there is
a swearword on this so I'm just warning
you now turn off the video because close
your eyes make like ends yeah guys for a
second or just just turn it off because
I'm gonna be saying the word - it's this
cropped e that says fancy as that word
the F word now I thought this shirt was
like super cool when it first came out
into the store I was just like oh my god
I need to have that because anyone that
knows me just knows that I like wearing
graphics that are super inappropriate
there are times obviously where I choose
not to wear something like this like if
there's gonna be a lot of children
around or something that it's a little
inappropriate but like out at a club
with like a really nice circle skirt
like a high-waisted shorts or something
super cute and it fits really well and
honestly like I love it so much it's
really cute you guys have some fun with
it once in a while it's like my style
perfect the next thing I got is a maxi
skirt so it's blue and white striped all
the way down it's really nice and long
which is good for us because we're you
know we don't have very short legs so
often like skirts that I've tried have
been a little bit too short for me but
this one is perfect length I can wear it
even high-waisted so I love that and I
know if you guys can tell there is a
little slit that goes down the side here
which is really nice so when it's really
hot out like Mikan just my leg like he
founds a little bit breathe and it's
just like perfect it's super soft and
stretchy and a little bit and what's
also really good about these skirts is
like we're tall we can wear them but
even my sister who has like shorter legs
and I do and she's shorter than I am she
can still pull it off and it really
depends on where you position it and
I've even seen some girls that like tie
like we're not is still tied in a little
knot and that way they can wear it if
you're shorter and it just looks good
with like every girl it's exactly it's
so pretty and good it's so pretty big
for spring and summer looking yep really
good um the next thing that I purchased
is this dress I love it me my sister
actually share this one it's just like a
really nice floral spring dress but my
favorite thing about this dress is the
back and I don't know if you guys can
see but it's super super open back and
you can adjust the straps to make it if
you really want it low back feel good I
really like that I like what in the back
is the whole back is shown whereas my
sister Connie legs just half the box you
can really adjust the position of where
you want like the length of the back
yeah yeah and also it's just like really
like it reaches around here and it's
swiggy and really pretty and um since I
do lower the straps it does go a bit
lower on me on my legs but I mean I
don't find that a problem it's really
nice and if you do find this short on
you you can always wear like biker
shorts
thing and you can spice it up with heels
or you can wear it to a really nice
dinner with some flats
even today things that I think it would
yeah yeah well party or something yeah
over bikini because you could see like
the back mm-hmm it's really nice I love
this dress awesome okay the next thing I
got is a little bit different for me
it's actually pence so these are pens
right here as you can tell they've got
this awesome like flower pattern on them
and when I first saw this I was like hmm
like what would you wear this with like
I don't know I don't know and then
basically my friend tried them on and I
was like wow they actually are so
flattering they're nice and tight wasted
at the top and then the bottoms are
extremely flowy just like this and if
you pair this with like heels and a nice
little crop top or like the orange top I
show you it's amazing it actually looks
so good and I think like just for like
even a family brunch or like a nice
little outdoor event like these are
actually really original and I think
like you'll stand out wearing these it's
not something you see every day you know
and they're really flattering like I
know it's more you believe you see them
you're like what is that it's so weird
yeah there's so nice on it even if your
legs are together it looks like a skirt
exactly you know it's really neat it's
cool and like heels no heels like it
just works perfect so this is like
different for me but I'm definitely glad
I got these and you guys should
definitely try them up yeah awesome the
next thing that I got is of course the
CHEO or the famous CHEO that everyone
should wear because these are amazing
I like almost wear these on a daily
basis now and I never really want to
wear a bra again so comfortable too
yeah and this print is really cool so
basically what the CHEO is is just kind
of like a bralette slash bondo or bando
however you guys sing it I say bondo
it's like this really cool tribal print
on it or like brazilian print and then
the back is the best part because it's
got these like stripes just like this
they go across your back and it looks so
nice with an open back t-shirt like she
was shy on the white one if it's group
slow you could show the stripes it's so
flattering and under a white shirt yeah
I see their pattern it's actually really
cute yeah and this just keeps everything
together and honestly like if I find
they stretch a lot because if you see in
the store they're kind of tight
and the first time you tried on you're
kind of like I don't really know but
they stretch a lot yeah yeah I have
bigger shoulders and like a wider frame
here and they it fits me perfectly
so and then she's tiny and it fits her
perfectly so it's strange like how it
like forms to your body
mm-hmm so even if I needs one size I
mean somehow it just meant just to fit
like a lot of different yeah no it's
awesome magic yeah
and they also have this in black which I
definitely want to pick up because you
can't go wrong with black black goes
everything good well speaking of the
black version I actually picked it up so
here it is and I love it just as much as
she said I mean the black even it goes
with everything I can even wear it under
like a black dress and it just adds that
like extra detail in the back and I just
throw this under even a white top like
anything it's just honestly it's like a
classic yes so good to have and even if
you don't have open back just the fact
that you could see this through the
shirt it looks really cool I get
constantly controlled what is that no
Sony exactly and yeah it's just perfect
they have a lot of colors they have like
a mint got like turquoise yeah it's
really like you look in an army are you
fine - yeah I think I'm gonna end up
with all of them to be honest yeah
they're just
exactly I'm like I've never tried this
but my sister works out in hers I was
like oh well it's nice I was like why so
the next thing I got is this really
really really soft I've never felt
material this off in my life it feels
like air seriously though and it's just
a really big muscle tee and it says I
love you to the moon and back so I don't
know if you can see that it's really
like a a gray wash kind of destroyed at
the ends big muscle tee so I like to
wear this with like Bondo's or Chios
underneath just so it shows because the
arm like circles are really big and I
just think it's really flattering and
pretty the other top I got is another
kind of basic from Brandi I think it's
called the Gisele top and it's basically
a tiny little crop tee and when I first
saw this I was like oh like there's
hardly any material on this looks like
it could fit like you know a little
or something but actually when you put
it on it's really cute because it's nice
to see a little bit of skin on the top
if you are with high-waisted choice I
think it's just the right amount of skin
and it's not like too much or anything
and the back goes a little bit low so
once again you can wear Chios you can
wear any cute little bondo top you have
and we have this I think in white and
Pia turquoise so like if you guys are
want to have more color for spring like
you can totally go and pick that it yeah
I have the white one and honestly like
it's a really stretchy material I
thought it's really good
I'm comfortable honestly a high-waisted
skirt or high-waisted shorts it's you
can't go wrong yeah there you go oh I
love this yeah and the next thing I got
is this skirt I think this is this what
is this Sylvia I think Sylvia I'm pretty
sure this is Sylvia it's just a red
skirt like this gorgeous color it's
really flowy I wear this a walk I like
to wear this high-waisted you can wear
it high waisted or you can wear it on
like lower down yeah I want but I like
to wear it with like you know like
pictures oh it's called yourself Yeah
right like the Giselle talk because I
also have the white one so I thought
like this is really cute with the white
top or like any graphic crop top that I
have or like the first top that she
showed you like the pink one went on
white would look so pretty and be really
cute and this you can just pair a lot of
things and it's so nice for spring and
summer and I've worn it so many times
like out on a tour ass somewhere eating
dinner it's just really pretty super
comfy and I think what's great is you
can also like you can wear not just in
the summer you can wear it when it's a
little bit chillier with tights or
something I think that you can wear it
like throughout many seasons actually
that's why I like it's a good color for
that too because this color it's like
every season it's all go yeah definitely
speaking of skirts um I got this one
right here I love the pattern I love
this one so much it's so nice it's so
cute and I tried this on and I loved it
instantly because I just thought like it
was like the perfect length it's so
flowy and comfortable and like I have so
many white tank tops I think this would
look really cute with just like to keep
it simple on top and have like the funky
pattern on the bottom so I guess and see
it's just like really nice and flowy
like this and I love it it's just
perfect
yeah it's it's
so nice yeah I have another graphic tee
here that I'm going to show you that has
a swear word so for all of you guys are
y'all sorry guys or these I have some
young cousins that watch my videos so
guys don't watch this right now because
there's a swear word coming out oops um
it's the same graphic as the fancy as us
but this one is the one that says bitch
don't kill my vibe and I just thought it
was so funny because it's kind of an
inside joke with my friends if we say
that but also just super like badass and
like I don't know I like wearing this
out in public actually like it's badass
it's fine I like head even with like the
red skirt that I showed you or
high-waisted jeans shorts it gets super
cool so I like the song - I didn't even
know the song when I first saw this yeah
I neither - Lee yeah I didn't really
cool so the next piece of clothing I'm
gonna show you is this gorgeous white
sweater looks like this and I saw
someone at brandy melville wearing this
shirt and I thought it was so cute
because the fact that it's so flowy and
such a pale color I love that you can
wear it over any kind of flowy dress or
a skirt or anything like that and I used
to not think sweaters in the summer
we're like would look cute but when it
gets a little bit chillier you throw
this on over anything and it just it
looks so cute it looks so good on and
you can wear it like over the shoulder a
little bit like it just falls really
nicely and I feel like everyone who puts
it on it's just like it fits in a
different way but it's just like
gorgeous and it's also nice how it's a
bit of what the high-low kind of not too
much billing if you can see like it's
shorter in the front a bit longer in the
back and like on the side it kind of I
know I just side you know it's really
soft and it's just a really nice simple
sweater yeah it just goes with
everything I just I honestly I'm so
happy I like if I had this which I
really really want to get it know I
would wear this like on the beach mmm
bathing suit when it starts to get
chilly yeah and you can speed through it
a little bit which is yeah so it's
really cute that's better um so then the
next thing I got which I don't think I'm
gonna be wearing this in this summer but
um definitely wear this in the fall but
they are the army leggings
they're kind of like jeggings actually
build out jeans a little bit thicker
than ladies yeah
and they fit really really really well
they're just like really I don't even
know it's it's strange because like
brandy melville is one size but this
fits me and it fits my sister and we're
completely different body types I was
wondering about that so they do as they
stretched and so like my sister's tiny
she's like tiny but like I have kind of
a bigger butt but this like it fits both
of us like really nicely and I really
like them they're super comfortable
super super super soft and definitely
wearing these a lot in the fall I have
so many outfits already picked out with
these like with some really nice dogs or
something Army's really in like it's
yeah it's a cool trend it's really cool
I love it yeah so the last thing I'm
gonna show you guys is actually very
simple but it's these biker shorts I
guess you call them and this is perfect
for all of the skirts and all the
dresses that brandy sells you just throw
these underneath and that way if the
wind blows or anything you're safe
you've got these under and they're just
so stretchy and comfortable you're a
lifesaver
yeah honestly I can't believe I didn't
have these before I don't know how yeah
edge like I just I saw these sounds like
okay it's time to get them yeah and you
can even like fold these over they're
kind of high waisted so if you don't
want them to be a high waisted you can
like fold the top over you can wear them
to work out and like sleep I guess like
they're just so comfortable but I'm
definitely yeah that makes it they're
really versatile yeah to make sure we're
both wearing tops oh yeah I forgot yeah
yeah I actually got this hop that I'm
wearing right now and what I love about
it is the fact that there's two straps
instead of one and it goes all the way
to the back and on the sides it's nice
and low so you can wear like any of your
favorite wallets underneath and it's
just nice and light flowy on the bottom
here which is nice and I just throw it
with like high-waisted shorts like I am
right now and I love it it's really soft
everything a brand new song that's what
I love about it um and this is a tank
that I got from brandy it's really cool
I find it's like really really really
low on the side that could go like all
the way down here so it's really nice
with any kind of like bra underneath
whether it again anything and it goes
low all the way to the back and then
it's kind of like a racerback it goes
really long it's kind of
hi-low things so the back is really
really long Kobe stirred by which is
different leggings yeah and I really
like that because so basically what's
gonna happen now is I'm just gonna
briefly explain the other things I got
that aren't to do with brandy melville
I'm I think she still has accessories
that oh my gosh oh so sure go ahead
yeah okay I saw five Urban Outfitters
really quickly the other day and I got
two bras that most girls have brandy
where they're just like super comfy and
if this is what I do at least when my
CHEO is dirty and you wash it I will
turn to these bras because there's just
super comfy so that just this is the
first one it's like a lacy black bra I'm
super stretchy comfortable this is the
beige one over here I like it because
there's no padding but it does give
support
um I wouldn't necessarily suggest this
for girls that do have like double D's
or anything just cuz it wouldn't support
enough but for girls that do have
smaller boobs like us these are perfect
because they're so cute and they look
good under any top and it's just
wonderful it's nice in the summer to
just feel like free free yeah look at
the glade it just it's so comfortable
yeah she actually is wearing yeah I want
to it's very similar to what the one she
has yeah a beige version really cute
really really nice so the next thing I
picked up at Urban Outfitters is
actually by somebody that I follow on
Instagram she is a clothing designer and
when I found out that her clothes were
gonna be sold at Urban I was super
excited to run and pick it up because
she's really cool her style is like
really awesome it's basically that just
this muscle tee that says let's get
weird and I fell in love with it right
away just because it has everything that
I love on it like rainbows aliens it's
so her I love french fries I'm obsessed
I stream like it's my life and like
before I was gluten intolerant I did
love pizza and doughnuts so everything
about this shirt I just loved and it's
by Jack Panik
you can see here she's an awesome
designer she has a lot of really cool
clothes so definitely check her out and
then the last thing I got just picked up
these
one teaspoon shorts they're really cool
awesome color really cool cut like
actually like you were explaining our
they're super cool because the pockets
like are cutouts but like you could see
the pockets underneath hides your skin
just with the pocket yeah it's really
nice and they're baggy and distressed
and I don't know they're just super my
style and I'm excited to wear these over
the summer
normally one teaspoon retails for like
$150 but I got to use it for 20 bucks so
good and the color is such a good pop of
color yeah I loved it was even like with
this shirt that goes wearing earlier and
it's so nice really I love it and then
I'll just finish walk with two
accessories that I got a friendiy so I
got this bracelet right here it's a
turquoise cross bracelet and I think
it's just really cute like pop of color
as I said earlier and I like to stack
them on with other things in the summer
as well and I got this necklace it's
kind of like I guess like an arrow yeah
arrow necklace and I just got it because
it was a little bit longer and I have a
lot of like shorter gold necklaces and I
love like to layer those as well so
that's basically it bears yeah this is
my first haul I'm so excited I never did
any hot anymore yeah so I hope you guys
