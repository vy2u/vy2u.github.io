channel I am just in such a good mood
right now I don't know why I woke up in
such a positive mood but I really hope
that that positivity shines through the
screen towards you guys because I would
love you guys to have an amazing day and
I decided today to sit down and film a
much requested a much requested
pronunciation Alex springtime collective
haul if you guys follow me on any form
of social media Instagram Twitter
snapchat which you all should just
saying self promo you would have seen
that was recently in New York City where
of course I did some shopping because to
New York why not and also I've been
doing a little bit of online shopping
because I just have a really bad
addiction I justify it because I give a
lot of clothing away I donate a crap ton
of stuff and if you guys didn't know
hold the phone cut two seconds seriously
I'm not going to make this intro super
long I just want to say that dan and I
have actually started a couple's
blogging channel and I'm so excited to
be blog every single day we've been
doing it since January and I haven't
really talked about it much on this
channel but if you guys are curious I
will have the link listed down below
because we are hosting a giveaway at
this moment I'm giving away some clothes
so if you want to go check out the video
I'll have the video link down below so
you guys can see what you'll win and
stuff because I do a lot of stuff like
that I decided that it's a magical
shopping again because why not
honestly I've ever since I had a job
when I turned 15 16 I just shopped but
so this is a collective haul it's
throughout the past maybe month month
and a half um stuff from New York online
stuff stuff from the mall well we'll
just get started I'm going to start off
with Brandi because Brandi is just
always such a popular thing when it
comes to any type of social media don't
know why actually I do you know why I
love Brandi so the first top I got which
I actually yet to wear is this one
this is going to be kind of hard to
explain but I'll have the clip inserted
what it looks like on it's like a silky
kind of t-shirt and it has two strings
that are in the middle and they tie in
the front and it's a little bit sexy so
okay I have really broad shoulders so
this top I think is meant for someone
with like not broad shoulders because it
is very sexy on me so I'm still like not
sure how I feel about it but I think I
could really dress this up it's just
that I never go anywhere I literally
never dress up so it's kind of but the
next thing is totally on my alley
because it's things I love to wear it's
a simple gray t-shirt it's not really
cropped it's super simple it is a like
grey with a little bit of black it's
kind of a stone wash I really like the
feeling of this kind of material it's
stretchy it's comfortable and it's gray
which is my favorite if you guys already
couldn't tell by all my other videos
then that the next t-shirt I got is a
vintage vintage it's not really vintage
but it's made to look vintage Led
Zeppelin t-shirt how freaking awesome is
this I am one of those people that I
actually really do listen to the bands
that I wear on my t-shirt
I mean sometimes I'm guilty and I don't
know all of their stuff but I would
never really wear a bad t-shirt if I
didn't know one single song because I
don't even if I like the shirt I just
feel like that's weird but Led Zeppelin
obviously if you guys followed watch my
vlogs you guys know my dad's in a band
I've read listen to all old school rock
and roll love it so plus it's pink so
like why not this is so cute I actually
have yet to style this and put on
Instagram but I'm so excited to do that
because it's just such a cute top also
in the summer with like ripped black
jeans or jean shorts so
so cute and then the last sweater I have
here is a cropped
stonewash sweater which I got a ton of
questions about because I wore it in my
thumb in New York City on Instagram and
in my blog and it's just this simple
hoodie
a little bit cropped it's more on the
thicker side I really like the hood of
it though so it's probably not the best
for summer but on like those really cool
nights totally could get away wearing
that but I just really like the color of
this so that's everything from brandy
let me know what you think about the
first t-shirt what I should do about
that situation if you think it's worth
the money I don't know then I did some
shopping on revolve I got two items the
first one being shorts because I needed
some high-waisted black shorts that I
wanted them to be a little bit baggy on
me I have really tight high-waisted
black shorts but I wanted some that were
a little bit more on the baggy side whoa
it gets so bright when I do this so
there by the brand one teaspoon and the
reason why I wanted them at the bag is
because I have those belts like you know
the ones that are like below the belt
I'd have with the to UM strap things I'm
just going to insert a picture because I
don't even know how to explain it but I
wanted to wear that belt high weight
with high-waisted shorts but I want the
shorts to be baggy and then have the
belt to be real like really tight I
don't know I just have this image in my
head
and I wanted to recreate that and see if
I liked it so M besides I just needed
some high-waisted black shorts so I got
these super comfortable really durable
one teaspoon has been a favorite of mine
for many many years so I just knew it
couldn't go wrong with this lower bowl
or ball is the best literally the best
brands right now I'm going crazy over
there Coachella stuff they've really
good festival things they have really
good springtime stuff bathing suits
everything right now is just on point so
my hats go off to you the next thing I
got is a purse it came in this like bag
because it's I guess fancy um it's
called
sanction Sancha Sancia saying sure how
do you pronounce this does anyone know
um that's all the bag by the way
this is the purse oh how frickin cute
yes oh my gosh I'm obsessed so it's a
crossbody bag or like you squared over
your shoulder I have yet to take off the
wrappings on little things because I
literally just got it um I needed a bag
for Coachella because I don't actually
have anything other than my wise cell
purse but I'm not going to be bringing
that to Coachella clearly because I
don't want anything to happen to that
because that is like my baby and I
wanted something more like Festival II
so I just thought this was a really good
purchase um it's pretty spacious
actually cuz if you can't tell there's a
thing on the side here which actually
expands a ton so you could fit a lot of
stuff in here and there's like two inner
pockets and a zipped pocket so there's a
lot of room when I went to Coachella
last year all I brought was my phone
some money an extra battery charger for
my phone which I actually got a new one
is supposed to be coming in the mail
it's really thin it supposed to be like
the size of a credit card which is
awesome um my vlogging camera and some
like makeup touch-up things so I just
need room for that basically Sonia
something exactly like this and it's
coming out really like blue on camera
but it's like a greyish turquoise I just
really like a lot its Wade and fringy
and its wings and it reminds me of Kyla
when she was little because when Kyle
was little she was obsessed with
anything that like swung okay let's put
this stuff away I have this weird
obsession right now with really
oversized sweaters so the first one is
like this one that I'm wearing right now
from Calvin Klein I got it off of Urban
Outfitters calm it just really oversized
it says Calvin Klein Jeans and it's just
this beige color I'm totally into this
right now I'm thinking with a tad in the
summer with some ripped up denim and my
Easy's yes I just have when I like buy
things I picture outfits in my head you
guys
that too cuz super into that I had then
gone shopping with Kapil and I didn't
often need this at all but I really
really liked it and she didn't like
convinced me to get it but she told me
she just really liked it as well so that
just convinced myself that I liked it
it's from Topshop and it's just a Navy
oversized simple sweater or jumper oh
whatever you guys say I don't know what
this is called but it's just simple and
you know what's funny I got this from
the men's section so this is technically
from Topman I love it and it's a size
large I believe yep so this could
totally fit Daniel but UK size large is
like not US size large UK size largest
US size small for men because I don't
know why you cave boys are supposedly a
lot smaller than u.s. or Canadian men
the sizing is definitely weird but I
really like the color of this and I've
worn a ton then from Urban Outfitters
calm again I got this adidas sweater
which is super oversized and very very
soft this the back has the adidas thing
on it as well it's a light grey color I
need to wash it because it has a little
bit of makeup right here I love this you
guys went crazy over it in my last video
as well as Instagram and I like this I
like when sweaters are super baggy and
oversized and you can wear them almost
as dresses I think that's gonna look so
cute in the summer with like booties
which I will show you later I just I
have another outfit in mind and telling
you guys oh by the way I don't even
think I like said this I dyed my hair
can you tell I went a little bit more
white slash silver blonde it's looking
real dead right now because I put a crap
ton of this new product from Bumble and
Bumble looks like a sea salt spray and I
try to no it's okay
I mean it's making my hair look a little
crispy I need to play around a little
bit more so yeah I love this color
sweater with a 10 that's down
oh yeah and then I went to the store I
don't know if this is everywhere but
there's a store where I'm from called
Sports experts and they basically sell
like every single sports brand they sell
sports accessories things you do when
you do sports shoes tennis racquets
tennis balls whatever I thought leggings
they're from
they say just do it they're black and
they have the Nike sign on the leg um
the reason why I got these is cuz my mom
had a pair when I was little she had a
pair that were exactly like these
leggings just like a blue color and I
wanted them for so long but she can't
find them so when they saw that they had
them in black I was like well why not
but I mean it would still be awesome to
get her so mom if you find them let me
know because I love them so much oh I
actually recently got a vintage sweater
but it's taking forever to come in the
mail because it's from a UK vintage
store so when that comes in I'll
probably have to do an updated haul in
like a few weeks just because I have
ordered things I have yet to come in but
it's just piling up in this video it's
gonna be so long Wow sorry and then I
guess I'll go onto my New York stuff so
things I got from New York I went into
Paige denim and I got this shirt it's
like a black and navy blue Paisley kind
of print it's just like a dress shirt
you guys know I'm so into these types of
shirts right now so I would just have it
button-down opened Oh No
tucked into like some high-waisted jeans
or high-waisted shorts in the summer
with some booties I really like the
print of this and the quality is amazing
and I think with some chokers you know
like the one I have from Nasty Gal
that's like velvet and then it goes down
really low I think with that would be
really really nice with that shirt I got
a pair of jeans from Paige as well and
these are like they're actually faux
leather they're not real leather they're
just wax on top of jeans to make it look
like they're leather but they are just
like simple black jeans that are made to
look like leather I know that's super in
right now and they were so comfortable I
try them on that salesgirl knew how to
get me also it didn't help that my dad
was there because everything I tried on
he's like oh yeah I get that get that
and I was like no stop you're supposed
to like as my father tell me not to
spend my money but he was an enabler I'm
just just saying dad you may be
- it just can't use it but you didn't
stop me and the reason why I got that
outfit specifically was to wear with my
new shoes and I'm so excited to show
them because I'm so in love with them
they were definitely an investment I'm
lending guys know they were expensive
but I wanted these for a while now I'm
just really proud to be able to like
afford something like this and just
cherish them you guys there's these
babies oh my gosh they're from Gmail she
I got them in New York I'm so obsessed
with them so they're just a basic like
leather boot with a thick heel has kind
of like a weird cutout here I really
like it with red and then my favorite
part is that they go up really high so
with the leather like jeans it looks so
good I see so many celebrities rocking
that kind of look with a really tall
ankle and the leather like leggings or
leather jeans so I really like this
they're so comfortable to walk in like
because I guess they're like thicker the
heel it does not hurt at all I walked
around New York City with them obviously
if you're gonna walk for like an hour
it's probably gonna hurt because you're
in heels but just to like walk to you
know few blocks and stuff or the out all
night kind of standing is not bad at all
they're so comfy so I'm so in love with
them and I see actually a few youtubers
have them but they don't say where
they're from and I wonder if it's
because they don't want to say they like
bought an expensive pair of shoes I
don't know but I'm in love with these I
think those with like the really
oversized sweater in the summer with
just your bare legs tend would be so
cute I don't know why I just love that
look yeah then on the last day I went
into acne studios and again my dad was
an enabler so thanks dad for this
that's okay I I should have self-control
I really should so I got a denim jacket
you guys know I love me my denim jackets
it's a little bit cropped it's a light
denim which is very different because my
favorite denim is usually the dark denim
but I just love the way this looked I
thought it was perfect for spring and
it's great because it's so baggy that
you can wear it over a sweater so you
can have like a big chunky sweater then
throw this over and it's still warm
enough I really really like it you guys
would have for sure seen it on Instagram
because I wore it at UM I just love the
fit of this so much the last thing I got
in New York City from acne studios was
this and I get a crap ton of questions
about this because I wore it in my last
video and I was waiting to talk about it
in this video that's why I didn't like
say anything in the last video um it's
an oversized bomber jacket and it's got
black inside it's so comfortable and
soft and what I really liked about it is
that the whole style of this was made to
be like a vintage 70s curtain so that's
what I really thought was awesome
because this is what like a curtain
pattern would be from the 70s and I
think it looks great with black so warm
and comfy where it literally every
single day I love it so it was
definitely kind of a bigger purchase I
kind of went all out with that but I
actually don't feel bad because I'm
really really in love with it and then
the last thing I got which is not in New
York I actually got it when I got back
from Turks and Caicos because Patrick
shout out to you you're probably not
watching this but if you guys don't know
who he is he's test his boyfriend and
he's a photographer and when we went to
Turks and Caicos together he had a
travel bag that I was obsessed with if
you know anything about me you know that
I hate bringing a lot of stuff I like to
bring carry-on a lot even for bigger
trips and my duffle bag was like huge it
was massive it everyone make fun of me
because they're like Alex like that's
way too big and it would never fit in
the overhead compartments I would a lot
of times have to like check it last
minute so this was perfect look at it
it's the perfect size it's got a long
strap like this to hold over your
shoulder when you're traveling or it's
got just the handles here
it's from the company Frye and I
actually been a fan of fry for a long
time I
foods from them even when I was younger
my mom has loved fry when she was
growing up as well so I thought this was
great it's really big on the inside it
fits a lot of stuff and I bring this
even like for it's a kind of like a
weekender bag like when I go sleep at a
friend's house or dads house or I you
know go away for the weekend I bring
this it's perfect fits a lot and then
when I travel to further places like for
example I'm actually going to Bali in
May which I'm so excited about and I'm
gonna be bringing just carry on so
you're allowed to bring two like luggage
things so I'm going to bring that with
my small suitcase and that's it and it's
perfect I know all my luggage will get
there and I won't have to stress about
losing my luggage so definitely a smart
decision to do if you travel a lot and
you are worried about not having your
luggage so let me know if you guys want
me to do a kind of part two to this when
all my other shipments come in because
there's a lot don't forget to check out
me and dan's vlogging channel or couple
channel whatever you want to call it I'm
so excited about it and if you've
entered the giveaway let me know as well

about that is seeing like positive
