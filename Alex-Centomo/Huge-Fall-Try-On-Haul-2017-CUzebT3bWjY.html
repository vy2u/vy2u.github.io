hey this little guy just sleepy one
okay so cute what's up everyone welcome
back to my channel guys it's full oh my
gosh okay I know it doesn't really seem
that way right now because the outside
looks like they're still green because
for some reason in Montreal right now or
I live summer decided to happen what end
of September it's summer we had the
crappiest summer ever and now that it's
officially fall summer weather is just
like hey what's up I'm not complaining
because I love the warm weather but I
like cannot wait to start wearing all my
sweaters and my like dark jeans and
stuff so obviously I did it a bunch of
shopping to kind of change up my
wardrobe and switch things up and I've
been finding so many amazing amazing
amazing things online and I couldn't
like not do a haul my hair is just like
honestly yeah whatever okay so this
video is kind of like the price ranges
from like pretty affordable to like more
expensive a kay revolve in free people
so we kind of got a big variety here
take it as you will um I'll start with
like actually I'm just gonna start with
Brandi because Brandis the first place I
went to brandi is like my go-to for
basics you guys know I include Brandi in
every single haul because as long as I
live I think I'll still shop at Brandi I
mean this sweater right here is from
Brandi it's just so soft and comfy and
oh you guys know when like the weather
changes and your scalp starts to get
kind of like dry and itchy which doesn't
make sense cuz summer weather but
anyways this isn't so fall but I thought
this would be cute for layering it's
just a simple t-shirt and it has the
same color as the sweater are just a
little bit darker I'd say it's a
commuted purple and
this I don't know I thought it would be
so nice with just a leather jacket
thrown over and basic denim jeans and
booties or something or sneakers it's
really simple you can wear this to
school you can wear it to anything
honestly and I love these types of tops
with like the different color shoulders
you especially the long-sleeve ones I
find their really flattering on my type
of body because I have like very broad
shoulders and like a bigger frame on top
I find it just kind of makes it look
really pretty and not dainty why was I
gonna say dainty I am a dainty necklace
then I saw this sweater in the store as
I was about to leave and I was like oh
my gosh oh by the way Brandis all one
size so there's that this color is so
nice oh maybe I should have worn this
sweater actually I don't know it's
basically the same type of sweater that
this is but it's a little bit looser and
I guess it's kind of like a light burnt
orange ooh pink it's not make sense no
it's like a salmon I guess I don't know
I really like this color a lot and it's
a really soft sweater but it's not too
thick so I think it's a really good
transition from summer to fall I don't
know where you guys live right now if
you guys are going into summer weather
then honestly this is kind of an
all-around sweater I would wear this any
time of the year because not too hot and
not too cold I feel like that was a song
when I was a kid the last thing I got
from brandy it was this hoodie and I
really like the color of this I find
light colors are still really in right
now especially for the fall time or the
transition period I should say and I
found this with a denim jacket over top
I have a few jackets that I'll show you
and I'll tell you which one I had in
mind but a denim jacket on top with
basic basic black jeans and sneakers I
thought would be so nice and if you tied
this drawstring into like a little bow I
thought that would be so cute and it's
oversized ish it's not like massive but
it's it's like an oversized sweater the
next things I kind of have in like color
coordination because I organized it all
on my like closet thing beforehand so
the first thing I have is this really
pretty pretty
this really pretty top this is from
majeure al and I got this off of the
revolve website and I thought this was
perfect for again another transition
it's got the floral pattern but it's
still like darker colors so it can be
worn in the fall time and it has this
drawstring here so you could either wear
it out as like its own top and kind of
put the stickies here so it shows a bit
of cleavage or you can wear a basic like
bodysuit like a black bobby suit
underneath and kind of have this draped
open I think that won't both be really
pretty and the sleeves are nice too
because they're not full-length and they
have a little button close so you can
actually put them higher up on your arm
and it looks really nice and I really
like the pattern a lot I'll have all
links listed down below I got this in a
size medium because I do like it a bit
oversized and the way that this fits on
me is like exactly what I wanted then I
saw this on Urban Outfitters like the
website and I was like oh my god it's
very bright in a person it did not look
like this online and I really really
don't like when companies do that when
they put like filters on their pictures
for the websites cuz I'm like but it's
not what it looks like in person but I
do have to say it's so soft and it's
really pretty and I don't know I thought
it looked really nice with my blonde
hair but yeah it was really like basic
it's kind of like a mock neck it's not I
wouldn't really consider it a turtleneck
because it doesn't go up so high but
it's really pretty and this was a like
black faux leather jacket I have one in
mind I'll show you guys I think it would
be really pretty at the pop of color but
it's still kind of fall themed and
imagine this outside with your little
like pumpkin spice latte oh my god okay
then we're moving on to a muted rustic
color this is from Windsor it's the size
medium / large because they have like
extra small small as one size and then
medium large as the other so I opted for
the medium large and if it's really nice
a little oversized I posted a picture on
Instagram actually and everyone was like
asking me or was even though I
type the brands and the pictures but I
could not not include this in the whole
because oh my gosh it's so pretty and
what I love about it are the sides they
have these little ties and it looks so
cute it's long it covers your butt so
you can even wear it with leggings if
you wanted and I just love this color
it's so beautiful the material is really
light and it's not itchy it's like a
perfect sweater I'd say moving on to
more of like a mustard color I'd say I'd
say this is mustard ish this is from
urban it's in the size large and this is
a cardigan that's super long and really
really soft it's a thicker material and
it's almost feels like stretchy even
though it's not but it's so comfortable
and I can just imagine wearing this with
a basic white tee or a basic white tank
with blue jeans a belt and like brown
booties I think that would look so
pretty for fall the way this falls is
like just below my butt and it has these
really nice pockets at the bottom of the
cardigan and then the sleeves are pretty
thick so it just looks really baggy and
loose and it looks so comfortable and it
feels like a blanket and I'm really
happy with this color as well I would
say it's mustard but I have a friend
that calls it a poop color so I mean
take it as you will but I really like it
okay moving more into Browns this still
has a hint of orange that's why I put it
over in like this section of my closet
but it's a flannel is from urban size
extra large I wanted this to be so baggy
and I am so happy about it it's the
softest plan of my own
normally my flat holes are like thrifted
and they're so soft because they've been
worn in for years and if ever I buy like
a new flannel which I haven't bought one
in years probably the last time I bought
it was from urban it was never that soft
this one is like the softest flannel I
own it looks really long when I do this
but it actually just covers my butt it's
not that long like you wouldn't be able
to wear it as a dress but you can
definitely wear it with leggings which
is what I wore it with I wore pumpkin
picking and it has a Pocky here it's so
soft is by the brandy deej
and I love that brand from urban I think
it's so nice and these colors are just
like my favorite thing like the reason
why I thrive in the fall time is because
of stuff like this so it has like a
burnt orange color it has green a hint
of purple and white and it's just like
my favorite thing and an item of
clothing I just love it so much then I
have this thing from Zara and I just got
this in the mail the other day this is a
size large
it doesn't fit like a large it fits more
like a medium might say or like a bigger
small if that makes any sense I never
know my sizes are because their sizes
are all over the place like I could be
as small in something and if you really
buy me and then I can be a large and
something else and have it be small so
when I order online I kind of just get a
bigger size and then if it doesn't fit
properly I'll exchange in store but I
really like the sweater it's mohair so
it's itchy on me I'm very sensitive to
like wool and mohair but I figured if I
worked like underneath a white kind of
really thin long-sleeve shirt underneath
or a black one it would obviously not
etch this sweater is from revolve it's
by the brand Tularosa and it's a size
large and this is really big like I
totally could have gotten a small this
is like massive but it's so soft it's
long it has these buttons that go all
the way down and stop around here I
probably would never button these up I
would just have it open but I really
like the color it was a really basic
nudish pink me trying to explain colors
oh my gosh
yeah it's a really fluffy material I
call it the Teddy material because it
feels like a teddy bear and I really
like it I figured this with blue jeans
and a white top can't go wrong the last
few sweaters are from Zara I'm pretty
sure they're all the size large I'll
just make sure yeah this is a size large
this is the softest sweater I've ever
owned in my entire life
I don't know what material this is is
it's a oh it's a 100% polyester it is
the softest thing I don't know how else
to explain it like it feels like like a
just pet it it feels like a cloud I'm
not even gonna make any
about the color of the sweater but it's
from Zara it's a size large it's pretty
it's oversized it's really really comfy
and yeah we're gonna move on this is
another turtle not another but this is a
turtleneck sweater it's a really light
gray material I don't want anything like
this tell any chickens ever do this when
I try on a piece of clothing sometimes
I'll picture myself wearing it out in
like a scene like oh I'm just at a cafe
with my you know chai latte with almond
milk sitting down like sipping on it
with this really comfy sweater and I'm
just pondering life and thinking about
things to write in my journal it's what
I think about what I buy clothing
sometimes please tell me I'm not the
only person that does that I have three
jackets I want to show you guys they're
all very similar and like the cut and
style I mean you'll see in a second but
they're different put the same style
that makes no sense you'll see so the
first time I got with some Topshop and
it's a basic oversized denim jacket but
it has this like faux fur lining this
isn't a size us 12 so I think it's the
biggest size you can get and I just
wanted it oversized the lining is all
the way everywhere inside with the
sleeves there's no fur but it has this
like thicker quilted material underneath
so it's super warm and this would be so
nice with a lot of the sweaters I showed
you or like that red turtleneck that I
showed you I think that would be so nice
with this and it's really really perfect
for fall I don't think I saw before but
a lot of pumpkins over there I cannot
wait until the leaves change colors and
all back there is gonna be like so
colorful it's gonna be so pretty
the next jacket is from Zara and this is
in a size extra large even though it
fits like really well to my body it's a
faux suede jacket very similar to the
other one in a sense with the faux fur
lined on the inside the quilted miss on
the sleeves but I love the buckles of it
I love the color
getting this screams fall to me it has a
really pretty gold detailing on it and I
could just dress this up so many
different ways for the fall time and
it's gonna be so pretty like how nice
this jacket though for real this last
one is the favorite thing I will not the
favorite it's my favorite thing that I
bought out of everything and I don't
know why I just really love the fit of
it I love the look of it I love
everything about it it's from Free
People it's a size large and it's a
vegan leather jacket oversized fit it's
called a thing a moto jacket and it has
this fur collar here obviously it's faux
and you can actually take off the beefer
if you want look for EXCI like that's
heady material it's just so nice I'm
like really washed out so I'll show this
for a second more it has like this I
don't know how to explain it but like
gunmetal detailing on it like the
zippers and the buttons and stuff and it
just looks so pretty and I love the way
it looks it's super super soft really
floppy that makes no sense but like it
doesn't have much structure to it and I
know that I'm gonna be wearing that a
ton this season so that is everything
that I have purchased within the last
I'd say month but because I was
transitioning into fall and usually this
time of year it's very cold also the
beginning of September it was really
cold but now it's summer weather again

but I will obviously have all the links
