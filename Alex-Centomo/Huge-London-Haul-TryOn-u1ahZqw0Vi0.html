channel I am currently in London right
now and I'm staying at an Airbnb in a
flat and I just think it's so pretty
like all the white and the lighting so I
just decided I was going to film a quick
haul for you guys so I bought some
things while I was here in London I'm so
sorry here noise
it's just I'm sitting right by the
window and it's really loud so you can
hear like the buses and the cars go by
but I did some shopping when I was here
in London as well as I got things for
coming here to London because I came
from basically New York City / Montreal
to here and in New York it was like 35
degrees Celsius because of how hot it
was and here it's like 15 16 degrees
Celsius and gloomy and raining so it's
completely different fashion so I had to
kind of be prepared for that and I
thought I would show you guys stuff that
I brought / bought because there's a lot
of fun things I'm gonna start off with
brandy Melville I went to brandy before
I came here and I brought a stack of
clothes but I really only used two
things so far and that is because the
other stuff was more in case it was
warmer here and which it wasn't
I wasn't sure everyone kept telling me
how hot it was in London and then
switched as soon as I got here but
anyways the first thing is this simple
grey tea these teas are key in white
grey black I have them in all colors and
this color grey is one of my favorites
of all time just I love grey you guys
don't know yeah these tops for layering
are so good because you can wear them
under jackets flannels and if it gets
hot you could just take off your flannel
and you still have a really cute tee
it's not too cropped so it's still
appropriate you could wear with
high-waisted jeans which is what I wear
it with and I think it's so cute I just
love the cut of it it's pretty
flattering and simple and just a basic
structured grey tee I bought the gray
sweater which if you watch with me and
Dan's vlogs which I think you should if
you guys don't know me and Dan have a
daily vlogging Channel it's like a
couples vlog and we've been doing daily
vlogs since January first it's almost
been a full year of us daily vlogging
and
or will him daily vlogging I only kind
of started doing it a few months after
that but still it's been a few months of
us daily blogging and if you're curious
to see when I get up to on a daily basis
definitely check that out the link
listed down below for you guys or you
can click right here interested but I
spoke about how I love gray sweaters so
much and then I showed this in the vlog
and so many people were like oh my god
Alex your gray sweater obsession but
it's still super cute so I don't know
how to explain this material it's kind
of like a waffle like material but
really loose I mean you see what it
looks like on it's a little cropped
that's only because I have broad
shoulders so this shirt gets pulled out
more if you're smaller framed it's
probably be longer on you and I'm also
tall so well tall I don't know
compared to my friends and people I know
I just like to roll up the sleeves
it's nice when there is a cool breeze
outside but I would still layer it under
a jacket or something cuz it's pretty
thin but it's so soft and so comfortable
guys Brad Melville I know you guys know
how much I'm obsessed with them but
seriously their stuff is just basic
simple soft and comfortable which is all
you need really it I'm also wearing
Daniels shirt right now because I slept
in it then when I was in New York City I
went to a store I forget the name of it
but I'll have it linked down below and
everything was looking really expensive
and I went to it cuz it was recommended
for me to go check it out I don't like
what the heck is this store it's
ridiculously overpriced I did not
understand it at all I actually found a
tee there that I loved and it was like
the cheapest thing in the store I wasn't
cheap like for what it is but it was
still like pretty affordable and just
like with cheapest thing in the store
but it was this or it is this tea that's
super oversized it says lard on it which
to be honest I don't even know what that
means and there's like seems to be a
like tractor dinosaur about to attack a
woman I just love the look of this and
if any of you know what this is please
leave in the comments down below because
I have no idea and I just thought it was
so nice I love
color of it and the fit of it I wore it
in New York the last day like coming
home but I've worn this in London
because it was so comfy I love these
kinds of teas that are super oversized
and long and just I love it but I have
no idea what it means is that bad I
don't care I were bad to you sometimes
that I don't like no the bands of but
whatever then I was looking around some
vintage stores when I was here in London
and I actually found a really cool find
so if you don't know anything about me I
grew up in a family in a home that was
always playing music my dad was in a
band um he has been playing guitar since
she was little and I just always grew up
with like basically 5060 70s rock and
roll music I mean my mom loves 80s music
as well can't speak my mom was eighties
music as well I just grew up listening
to a bunch of old bands and stuff and
one of my mom's favorites when I was a
kid with Bruce Springsteen and I just
fell in love I loved all his songs and I
just really liked him and I never owned
a Bruce Springsteen tee until this trip
so I found this vintage banty a Bruce
Springsteen on the back it says Bruce
Springsteen Born to Run
and this is an extra large men's it's so
comfy and so cool and I wore it like
basically as a dress I wore some shorts
under it so like you could kind of see
the shorts and it wasn't too risque and
then I wore it with my winter boots that
go over the knee and a big leather
jacket and I thought it was so cool so
this thing is awesome
I love the spine I'm so happy with it
and unfortunately it is vintage so it's
not like I can link it down below that's
the one thing about vintage stuff when I
show you guys I just have been in a huge
vintage shopping spree thing lately
because for one it's affordable and two
it's really cute stuff so I'll link
stores down below that sell vintage
stuff I just can't link the exact item
but I'll
linked stuff that's similar I find a lot
of things similar on you know a sauce a
sauce whatever I don't how to pronounce
it
Windsor they have some bad tees and
oversized jackets and stuff so there are
site that sells similar things for
affordable prices they're just not the
exact item but I'll have things listed
down below for you guys if you're
curious then the next two things are
vintage as well as are actually like
handmade I'm pretty sure I found their
website someone commented on my one of
my videos and I don't remember the
website's name off my heart but um they
basically sell vintage brands and they
crop them themselves so I thought it's
cool I got the first one is Tommy
Hilfiger and it's just a long sleeved
black cropped tee it's pretty basic and
straightforward I just thought it was so
cute yeah I thought it'd be perfect with
high-waisted black jeans with some
booties and hat or something or cap and
I just I really liked it and then the
next thing I got from there I shouldn't
I Instagram but it's this Fila sweater
so this was a lot more cropped so I
would definitely wear it with like
really high-waisted jeans not just mid
high-waisted it's pretty cropped but I
love this sweater as it is and then
cropped it's just even better so it's
super cute
I feel like I stay cute for everything
I'm so sorry guys if you're watching
this right now go comment cute yeah it's
so cute then the last few things are
again all vintage I'm so sorry guys but
I will link I promise I will try to find
really similar things if you guys are
curious because I have a very different
style than a lot of my friends and I
feel like I dress how I feel like
dressing and if I see something that I
really like I'm like oh I'm gonna wear
that I don't care if it's trendy or not
trendy I just really like it so the
first thing I got was in New York and
it's from vintage twin or twin vintage I
don't remember which word goes in from
the other but the vintage store in New
York City and it is this vintage aviator
bomber jacket that's from the US
military like it's literally certified
from the US military this was an
aviation jacket during
world war two I believe how cool is that
I just love clothing pieces that have a
story that have history to them you can
tell it's worn it's super comfy super
comfy super soft and I posted a picture
of it on Instagram and got so many
questions about it people were freaking
out over it and it's just this but it's
my new favorite item of clothing that I
own I'm so washed out right now oh my
god
I just really think it's amazing and I
wish I can ask the owner the story
behind it or where it comes from because
I just think it's really cool then the
next thing that's kind of similar and I
got this in London from a vintage shop
called rocket which is really cool here
and it's kind of similar but it's black
and it's a vintage leather jacket I
believe from the 80s or 90s and it's
super oversized and super comfy and cool
and I wish again I can know the history
and story behind this jacket flannel
underneath and like a long t-shirt dress
and hi-hi-hi booties and I didn't want
to buy a really expensive jacket so I
got this for I think it was 15 pounds in
rocket which is pretty good so I thought
that was a steal and plus I love it in
the last vintage item I have which is
actually pretty common and I'll link
similar ones below is this denim jacket
that I got from a sauce marketplace and
I like it because I has this like light
collar I don't explain it this jacket I
brought to New York and has so many
people compliment me on it every time I
was going to a shop walking down the
street if I took a picture in it people
always ask me or respond because it's
very oversized and just really comfy
it's great for layering so although it
was so hot in New York I sucked it up
and I actually kind of wore it one day
off my shoulders and then I but
up like the middle button so it was just
my denim jacket but off the shoulders
and so many people thought it was really
nice the way I wore it and I don't know
why I decided to do it like that but I
did and it was cool if you know me you
know I love oversized denim jackets then
the last thing I want to show you guys
it was actually something I got was in
London and it's from a sauce these funky
and glasses guys let us I see these
glasses everywhere and I think they're
so funny and I kind of look like a
scientist but I really like them and I
had a specific outfit in mind that I
want to wear these with and they are
super affordable I'll link it down below
they're really cool and I really liked
them so that is it for my haul like I
said I'll have things listed down below
