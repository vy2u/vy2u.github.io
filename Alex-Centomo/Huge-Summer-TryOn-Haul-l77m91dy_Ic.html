channel I decided to do a haul because I
just think these are like my favorite
videos to film other than like get ready
with these because these are just so fun
and they're my favorite videos to watch
because I'm so nosy and I love to see
what people buy because then I get
inspiration so recently okay not
recently literally within the past six
months I've had this obsession with like
going on these like website so you could
see what celebrities buy and then you
can either find cheaper alternatives or
you could buy the exact same pieces as
them I've been getting very inspired by
celebrity Styles there are certain
people three people that I just always
look at their styles so there's
sometimes four mainly three Gigi Hadid
is number one kendall Jenner
very close second like very very close
love their styles so much then I also
look at Haley Baldwin and sometimes
Selena Gomez cuz I just love their style
and I get very inspired by them and I
feel like right now the trend is like
very sporty slash rocker sometimes chic
and I just love that so much so without
further ado I'm going to get into my
haul there are a bunch of different
places I've shopped in person as well as
online that's so rude then I got this so
cute really really love this color
sweater cat Belle actually inspired me
to get this color because she has one
that's like really big and oversize I
wanted one more crop it's a good neutral
pink and honestly this with any type of
high-waisted shorts and sneakers is so
cute with a baseball cap love it and I
see that kind of look all the time with
celebrities they wear I love the crop
sweater the shorts with either like the
Stan Smith Adidas and a baseball cap or
like Nikes and then the last thing I
ordered from ASOS I was just
I saw it randomly and I loved it were
these sweatpants they're high-waisted
sweats with a drawstring and they're a
little bit more crop so they don't go
all the way down to the ankle and
they've a nice detail on the side like
this orange stripe and I think it's so
cute and really flattering I then went
to urban and I was there with my
boyfriend Daniel you guys don't know who
he is
we want you ever been mainly for him
because we want to pick up some new
stuff but then I went upstairs and I
found these shorts
calvin klein and they only had a size
medium which is really oversized but i
like it because i actually wear it high
up on my waist and then I tie the
drawstring super super tight so they're
really like baggy over my butt and stuff
and they're really cute so incredibly
soft this material is like ridiculous
and I've been wearing these almost every
single day with my white bands and I
just think it looks cute on to the celeb
trend I recently saw Selena Gomez
wearing this tee with these boots and I
think thought it was so cute that it was
like all buttoned up and it was like a
men's tee that she's just wearing as
like a dress practically and so I got
the actual one is like so expensive so
what I did was I went on Etsy and I like
searched around and I actually found the
exact same model but someone like makes
them like this person on Etsy I honestly
I forget their name if I can find out
link it down below but they make like
easy clothes all like themselves and
it's really cheap so the quality I don't
know if it's the same but they look
identical and they're way more
affordable so this is the top as you
could see it's unbuttoned because I'd
like tried it on but when you button it
up it's literally the same and I think
it's so cute with like foods so I'm
definitely gonna be styling this like so
cute this summer then of course panties
are so in right now like literally every
celeb I see that I stalk is wearing a
band tee at some point and they're all
over evolve they're all over Bourbon so
many websites are carrying band tees and
I'm the kind of person that like I feel
so awkward if I'm wearing a banty and
like I don't know the band or any of the
songs and someone asks me and I'm just
like yeah it's for the fashion so I've
been trying to buy like panties that I
actually know the songs to and I
actually like so there's like Guns and
Roses that I love ac/dc The Ramones I
really like the Rolling Stones if they
had the Beatles obviously that would be
like my number one but I haven't seen
that this is the current one I got from
ACDC knots not from ac/dc it's from
revolve but it is ac/dc and I got it in
a size large look how big it is in long
so what I did was I actually tied it up
in the front and wore it with like
high-waisted jeans
and the sleeves are super baggy so I
thought it was so cute and I really like
the colors of this because they're
neutral but then they have a really nice
bright colors here and I think it's so
pretty so very excited to like style
this and wear it again from revolve I
have this top which is just in a
button-down kind of looks like a man's a
man steep mountainsides medium is from
the brand Bella doll and I really like
the color of it because again with a tan
in the summer always look at clothes
that look good with tans and I just
think that looks so nice so I would have
it really button-down really loose the
sleeves are rolled up and then either
tucked into some kind of jeans like
white denim or just like lay loose with
really short shorts and heeled booties
and it's almost looks like a denim
material but it's not and it's really
soft
okay now moving on to like something
that I'm just so in love with and right
now is vintage Tommy Hilfiger so I see
so many celebs rocking that Tommy
Hilfiger and I am all for it I this is
if this is distracting I'm sorry so
there is a website that I introduce a
lot of my friends too called Frankie
collective it's all vintage clothing
they sell Tommy Hilfiger Ralph Lauren
Nike Adidas Calvin Klein everything is
vintage really good-quality really well
like it's nothing it's like distressed
or anything or ruined or stained and
it's like not dirty it's super clean I
really like it I've literally introduced
so many of my friends to it and I almost
didn't want to talk about it in the
video because I like don't want people
to like go on the website and buy the
stuff because it's not like they have
selections of like one sweater and a
bunch of sizes it's like one item once
it's sold it's sold that's it
and things go like this so like I'm
constant on the site like seeing if
there's cool things and if I tell a
bunch of people then everyone's going to
go on in everyone's have a shot from it
but at the same time I want to let you
guys know because I think would be
unfair if I did it first thing I want to
show you is this beautiful cropped
sweater look how cute it's super big and
baggy super cropped literally like you
raise your hands and your boob swap out
so like just letting you know to wear
some kind of like bondo or cute bra
light under it if you have really big
breasts this probably isn't the best bit
this probably isn't the best thing
because like yeah anyways love this
color yellow just says Tommy Hilfiger on
it and I've been wearing it a time so
much it's so soft is as if it's brand
new it's in this size medium I didn't
have an option of what size to pick it's
just whatever is available and then I
got two other things from Tommy the firt
the other one being this cropped
tee which is no and so I know because I
was trying it on okay so it's this one
just simple Tommy super cropped again
this isn't the size large but it's super
tiny so we'll see um it's really cute
anything high-waisted goes like you know
the really high-waisted jeans from
Topshop that would look awesome with
this yeah for that then the last thing
is this I think I've shown this before I
have worn this it's a polo crop again
with just a little Tommy Hilfiger logo
right here and it's navy blue really
cute again anything high-waisted because
this is all very cropped and then from
urban I got this I'm just going because
it's like Tommy Hilfiger again they are
selling the like bra let's and the
underwear so I got the bralette that
says Tommy Hilfiger really like this
color i worn in bali and it's so
comfortable so supportive i actually run
in this and it's great so i really like
it a lot I went to Brandi and I actually
did a brandy Hall on my periscope live
with my friend Mel so if you want to see
everything that I bought from brandy you
could check that out but I did get a
request to show some stuff in my haul
because it's like Tryon they want to see
what it look like on me so I chose like
everyone's favorite items and I'm going
to show those things so the first one
being this long-sleeve tee or
long-sleeve shirt from brandy its
striped it's really cute it's a little
cropped not too much but it's not like
long either really soft thin material so
obsessed with this then I got this one
which everyone freaked out over and I
see so many people wearing it it's just
a like bondo top but the has these on
the sleeve
so you can wear them off the shoulder
like that and it's cropped and really
really cute okay anyways the last night
I'm going to show you real quick is this
sweater from brandy has like a France
flag on it I'm so sorry guys that's so
annoying it's really cute okay I love it
so much it's like white and looks great
I'm gonna wear in Iceland and yes so
stay tuned for that this is literally
the story of my life like constant
barking anyways a pair of sunglasses
this is from the company oh it's just
like vintage frames I forget exactly
what the company is but they are these
vintage frames that Selena Gomez wore
and I think they're so cool they're just
so retro and I love it and like you can
wear them down like this and like I just
think they look really neat and I love
like different looking things so that is
cool they're a little crazy and like
probably not everyone will love them but
I just think they're really awesome so
that is it for my haul I obviously
constantly go shopping I hope you guys

much as I can find sometimes companies
