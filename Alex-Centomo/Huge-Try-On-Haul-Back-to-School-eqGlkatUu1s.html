times now and something just keeps going
wrong so hopefully this one works hey
everyone so I am here with a back to
school haul as you guys all know by now
by my other back to school videos I'm
done school so I am NOT going back to
school but I know a lot of you guys are
in school and I get a ton of questions
on like outfit ideas that I should wear
that you guys could wear in school and
stuff and I have been shopping like
crazy lately because I'm going to York
Fashion Week and just because I have a
shopping addiction so I thought that I
would just feeling a little bit
different instead of showing you
everything that I bought I would pick
out items from every place that I
shopped from and just kind of show you
things that I would wear back to school
things that are more appropriate I know
a lot of you guys have uniforms or
strict rules I don't know exactly your
rules but I'm gonna kind of try and show
you different options that you can wear
for back-to-school time that might be
okay for your high school or college or
whatever your going
make sure you stay till the end for a
surprise announcement again because I
have another surprise for you but this
one actually is like really good and I
hope you guys are excited for it because
I'm super excited for it so yeah let's
get started
so the first thing I want to show is
something that is like probably the most
simple classic best thing you can wear
at school just a plain old brandy
Melville t-shirt so this one is just a
simple one with a pocket it's a little
bit oversized it's just a classic white
t-shirt these kinds of tops are perfect
because you can pair them with literally
anything you can wear them with tight
skinny jeans you can wear them with
boyfriend jeans you can wear them with
shorts leggings cuz it's a bit long you
couldn't put a denim jacket over it
leather jacket over it you could tighten
and not to make it a bit more cropped
and wear it with something high-waisted
you can do anything and it's perfect
because it's just short sleeves and this
is like the classic top that I would
wear for back-to-school now if you like
graphics but you don't want to wear
something that has like a huge graphic
on the front because I know when I was
in high school I hated it when I used to
wear them because my teachers would read
them and then just pick my comments or
like
whatever so I would go with something
more simple so this is just a similar
t-shirt to the one I just showed you but
it's like a purplish blue color and then
on the like boob part it says California
1984 and it's simple nothing to like in
your face screaming at you but you could
still get your little graphic on it plus
I love this shirt this is my favorite
shirt that I own right now I wear it all
the time it's just like I'm gonna so
soft and comfortable and it's like the
best thing ever I just showed it on
Instagram actually so this is something
I would definitely wear like to bed and
then I wake up and go to school because
I was that kind of person
spritz and perfume make myself smell
good no one knows I don't sweat that
much okay guys and then the other thing
I would wear this is more of a layering
item because I know all of you guys
can't wear spaghetti straps at school
but these types of tank tops are awesome
to wear with high-waisted jeans we like
the rips and the knees and then paired
with like a denim jacket or something or
flannel I wouldn't wear flannel with
this pattern I probably more like a
denim jacket or like a leather jacket
but if you got it in white or something
again a flannel would look awesome I
just like these for layering because
they're super lightweight they don't
make you sweat
I like the button detail in the front as
you can see you can like bring it down a
little bit don't worry it's not too
scandalous but you can also just if
you're not comfortable with that have
them all buttoned up it's so cute this
is something I would have worn like I
said layered over looks like a sweater
over it a flannel or some kind of a
denim jacket with high-waisted jeans and
sneakers love it now kind of getting
into like the colder months when you're
going back to school for those of you
that live not in California but this is
like my new obsession
so obviously you guys know I'm obsessed
with turtleneck sweaters Coward
turtleneck sweater at this time of year
because I would just die of heat but
this is a pretty good alternative so
it's just a really thin lightweight 3/4
length sleeve kind of a long t-shirt but
it's a mock turtleneck so I don't know
if you guys will be able to see this but
I will show like
obviously the clip of me wearing it so
it doesn't go chew up too high up on the
neck super thin and lightweight and like
so flattering I would wear this with
honestly just simple denim jeans or like
a denim skirt I think that'd be so cute
or you know those skirts from Topshop
that have like the buttons down the
front
I was so where this would that and like
some really cute sandals so this is from
Free People the other three items are
from brandy this is some Free People
I think it was like $40 which is kind of
a lot for a t-shirt but I find Free
People items last so long I still own
four pupil items from like 2009 I'm not
even kidding you guys like my mom
started shopping there when they opened
where I'm from and I always used to
steal her stuff a lot of it's still in
my closet sorry mom but it's lasted so
long and I wear it like all the time so
that's something that could like you
know for those of you that are obsessed
eternal links like I am that's something
that could help you out something more
lightweight more thin and yeah you can
style even like a vest over be so cute
the next thing I want to show you guys
is this really awesome like t-shirt
dress kind of thing I don't spin it -
Nick - Nick that's the word and it's
from Windsor so it's striped and it's
long-sleeve and it's like a dress but
it's pretty long it goes like mid mid
thigh but ready what I like about it is
the back because it's a little bit open
not too much that it's inappropriate but
if you can't wear something that's open
back you could obviously throw on some
kind of jacket over it or whatever just
something denim or you can tie like a
denim shirt around the waist I think
that'd be so cute and I just really like
this like small stripe material I know
Brandi sells a lot of stuff like this
and it's honestly the same material as
Brandi like windsors on top of their
game right now I just have to say loving
their stuff lately so I'm actually
bringing this to New York Fashion Week
with me I'm so excited to style it I
have like these tall boots I'm gonna
wear with it and I'm just really good so
gonna rock it but it's cute because it
flares out just a little bit so it's a
little swingy and I know my sister and I
have a thing with 20 dresses we just
love them so this is super cute and I
would wear this with like tennis shoes
if I was going to school and maybe like
a denim vest or something I don't know I
love this kind of thing and if you guys
like to wear dresses back to school you
could totally wear something like this
you're not comfortable wearing dresses
then you can put on some tights or
something underneath or you don't even
have to wear this you know it's all
optional I know I just did this okay so
I have two more clothing items for more
warmer weather so these are a pair of
like sweatpants but they're not
sweatpants
they're like the harem pants so like or
harem how do you say that harem harem
I don't know but they're like the drop
crotch basically that goes skinnier at
the ankles so there's gonna be
impossible to show but this is like the
bottom that's kind of tight and it
doesn't go all the way down to my ankles
it's like pretty close to my ankles but
not entirely with the drop crotch and I
would wear this more low waisted love
these this is something I would totally
wear to school
I would wear them with my adidas
superstar sneakers that I'm obsessed
with and like a simple white shirt like
the one I showed you from before kind of
tucked in on the side I love that it's
like the lazy casual look but you still
look cute and you're kind of just like a
boy but it's like cute you know what I'm
saying and like a baseball cap if you're
allowed to wear baseball caps at school
if not then just put your hair up in
like a ponytail I don't know I love that
look so I'm obsessed with these I got
them from revolve and I literally it's
kind of gross how much I wear these
because I don't wash them that often oh
I like psyching you to like I honestly I
I some I feel like I sounds so gross
okay the last clothing item is this
thing from actually allied I have two
more clothing items this one is from
Windsor and it is a lightweight hoodie
so it's just a simple hoodie like that
you would see anyone wear except it's a
little bit more oversized and it's
lightweight it's very thin it is the
softest thing in the entire world what
is this what material is this it feels
like I'm touching a bunny rabbit like
obviously it's not rabbit fur guys don't
worry I would not wear that the softest
thing I don't know what it is I need to
like message Evelyn and ask Evelyn are
you watching this what is this made out
of
Evelyn's head of social at Windsor what
is this it's so soft
I want a blanket like this
okay the last clothing item I have I
show this in my back-to-school lookbook
and I got so many questions about it so
I'm going to talk about it a bit
it is this sweater from garage holy crap
this thing is my holy grail it's an
oversized knit sweater cutest color ever
and I got this in a size large because I
wanted to be super oversized and I want
to cover my butt so that I could wear it
with leggings so I would normally roll
up the sleeves but oh guys this thing I
love it so much I think garages back to
school line is on point right now if you
guys don't know what garage clothing is
I will link everything down below of
course but garage clothing has really
stepped up their game I used to shop
there when I was like in grade eight or
something and then and there was like
very young now it's like more older and
I just I love this sweater so for those
of you asking it's from garage and it's
I think it's like a perfect color for my
skintone my hair I don't know I love
everything about it so that's everything
for clothing but I do want to talk about
one fashion accessory because this is
super on-trend now and this is actually
something I would wear to school so this
is a necklace so it's made out of like
this like velvet material I don't even
know explain it's like a ribbon but
basically what it is is you wrap it
around your neck not like this you would
like wrap it around twice you would
basically make a choker so you would
wrap it around so that it's like a
choker here but then this part kind of
hangs down low in between your boobs I
don't know why I did this in quotations
it's on trend right now this is by
Vanessa Mooney I got it on Nasty Gal and
it is like so cute I would wear this
with like a tank top it's a bit lower
down and then how this go down and have
like a jacket on top or something okay
guys so I hope you enjoyed the video now
on to the surprise announcement I'm
gonna be doing a giveaway of course I'm
doing a back-to-school giveaway kind of

wince will be down below but anyways
let's get on to the giveaway the first
thing you're gonna be winning of course
it's back-to-school I'm gonna give away
a backpack but it's not just any kind of
backpack
it's a fringe backpack whoo look at that
this is like super cool and like very
bohemian I just like have enough session
with Fringe lately and I think it's so
cute so you can twist the thing to open
it and there's a huge pocket in the
middle as well as like smaller pockets
and a section to put like your iPad and
then another small section and stuff for
your iPhone and everything like that so
I absolutely love this it's pretty good
quality I like the back how it has like
these different straps you can actually
take off these if you don't want them
and just hold it like this like a little
suitcase I think it looks vintage
something that you buy in Free People
it's from Windsor but I love it so much
so this is the backpack you're gonna be
winning and inside of it or a bunch of
things so the first thing you will be
winning inside of the backpack it is
this really cute crisscross in the back
like tank top that goes up kind of high
I think this would be so cute with a
flannel so I thought this would be
perfect for back to school haul is from
brandy and it's a really stretchy
material like really stretchy so I
thought that would be good and cute and
it's a dark grey which would go with
literally anything perfect for
back-to-school and fall times so that's
the first thing the second thing is a
super cute graphic from brandy that says
okay but first coffee and it's just a
simple cropped tee that's white perfect
for back-to-school
I love graphics and teachers will relate
with this because they all drink coffee
so I thought that was really cute and so
that's the second thing the third thing
is this oversized grey t-shirt with
these stripes on the sleeves from
Windsor it's really long so you can wear
this with leggings or I would even wear
it with shorts and then kind of tucked
in on the side it's so cute I'm obsessed
with these kinds of shirts
oh so this is really soft as well and I
thought it would be a perfect
back-to-school top because it just
me at school when I look at it I don't
because the stripes are not but I think
of school time when I think of that
sherry then another tank top is going to
be this one from Windsor it's kind of
like that high neck that goes like this
on the sleeves like cutouts it's not too
cropped it kind of goes down to like
where your pants would be so that's
really cute and it's just a striped
black and white t-shirt I love me some
stripes obsessed so this is really cute
super good for layering as well and it's
not spaghetti straps I'm sure most of
you can wear it if not then you compare
it with like I said a sweater cardigan a
kimono jean jacket anything like that
then I'm going to be giving away this
pair of shorts because they're so
stinking cute they're high-waisted their
pattern and they're very stretchy here
but they're like form-fitting they're
not uncomfortable they're very flowy and
I would wear this with just a like
cropped white t-shirt or something like
that I think would be so cute with just
like really cute sandals this is such
like a statement piece but it's simple
like I would wear everything else simple
and have this be the statement piece so
like simple white shirt simple sandals
nothing too crazy not like crazy
accessorized like this will be like the
statement piece it'd be so cute then I
have this shirt which is from garage and
it's still it's summery but this is
still on trend and I would definitely
wear this like underneath a denim jacket
so it looks like this so it's a little
bit cropped it's very lightweight and
you can either wear it off the shoulders
like this or you can wear it on the
shoulders with a denim jacket so in the
summer you can wear off the shoulders if
you live in California or somewhere hot
in the world you can wear off the
shoulders if you live somewhere that's a
bit colder you can kind of wear it up
and style it how you like but I love
this top so much and I own so many tops
like this so I thought this would be
perfect for you guys and then of course
I'm gonna be giving away a headpiece
because y'all know I'm obsessed with
head pieces because I wear them all the
time I usually get mine from Free People
so this is the one I'm gonna be giving
away it's like a crisscross in the front
and I would just wear it like I don't
want to put it on so I don't get makeup
on it for you guys but basically I'd
wear it like on my head with like
hair flat so cute so bohemian would like
something very baggy to wear I know you
can get you guys can dress this up
however I would wear it with like an
oversized t-shirt and like harem pants
but like I know Carina wore this a Toshi
I go with a cute little like romper
dress thing and it was so cute so and
then the last thing that's gonna be
inside the backpack are a stack of pura
vida' bracelets oh this huge stack I got
for you guys it's all different colors
all different designs beads and
everything I think these are so cute for
summer time and for back-to-school
because they just they just kind of
brighten up your outfit any kind of
simple outfit that you're wearing it'll
just add something extra and special
they're just like handmade bracelets and
they're adjustable so you can pull the
strings and stuff and that is all for
