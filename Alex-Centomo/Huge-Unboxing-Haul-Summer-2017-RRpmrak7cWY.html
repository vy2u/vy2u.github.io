channel first thing I just want to say
is I'm sorry to hear any weird noises my
neighbor across the street is mowing his
lawn of course like the one time a
defense zone but it's going to probably
take a while he's a really big yard so
I'm just going to get into it I
obviously have an issue where I shop way
too much online and I've been coming out
with halls and try on haul but I have
not done an unboxing haul and a long
time and it's taken all my willpower not
to open these packages I want to make
sure I have like a bunch of them so I
can open them on camera so this
unfortunately is not a try on haul just
letting you guys know so if you are
really not into unboxing hauls and
there's like really no point me watching
this but if you are curious to see what
I recently got and what I am going to be
showing in my upcoming like lookbook I
have a few videos in mind so you will
get to see what the items look like on
me in a few videos this day too literal
I'm saying solver okay anyways okay so
some things I ordered some things were
gifted to me I'll let you guys know I'm
going to start off with the first things
I have no clue what's in this one oh I
was like why don't you like employed
material but also a square that's funny
okay this might not be interesting for
you guys but I got these sheets or this
a duvet cover it's for actually the
guest room downstairs so I thought that
is then I got this package in this one
says it's from Tarte
what whoa guys that's look at me okay
wait I didn't get a picture of this
before I do anything what wise guys may
collide these are only favor products
Thank You tart so wonderful thank you so
much tart like that's insane I've never
received a package like that I'm like
I'm actually floored that's crazy okay
next I got a big box this is from
revolve I'm going to put Hamptons with
the would revolve again this year for
the fourth of July I went last year and
I have some goodies that I chose for the
Hamptons that I'm going to be filming a
look like when I'm there so you guys
will get to see what all of these look
like E so we first have so these shorts
are mine by the way
they're from the brand by the way and
they're really cool they remind me is a
1 teaspoon ones but the ones I have from
one teaspoon are like really shrunk I
don't know why like I honestly didn't I
never put them in the wash I wash them
on delicate on cold and they just shrunk
so I figured these would be a good
duplicate plus they're really cute I
feel like I just said duplicate really
weird I already said cute there's no
hearing for then I got these jeans from
girlfriend denim because girlfriend
denim is one of my favorite brands for
jeans and they're high-waisted long
jeans and I'm going to roll them up at
the ends but they're pretty straight leg
they're just basic blue can't really go
wrong pair shoes from Ray look how nice
these are they're just simple slide on
sandals with this amazing detail flower
detail and they're nude so I figured
this would go with a lot of different
options I don't own anything like this
so I thought this would be perfect
ooh let's see fit
and the shoe bit fit beautiful dress
some Tularosa so this is a maxi dress I
don't think I'll be able to see the full
detail of it but I'm excited to wear
this we have this beautiful brunch
that's planned and I thought this would
be perfect it's kind of open back and I
love this print and the top is just like
Sikkim so I thought this color would
look really pretty I don't know anything
like this so I thought that would be
cool
from lovers and friends really cute crop
top that's longer on the sleeves and
actually ties around under your boobs I
also quite a few shirts like this so I'm
sure you guys all know what this looks
like on me to give you a reference it's
going to tie like that I love this
pattern I don't know
I see ours by just eight hours but I
figured this would be cute for like a
night out just a bodysuit that's lace
and very very open in the back then this
top from Alessandra is mine called la
off-the-shoulder crop top and it's like
a periwinkle blue waste material so cute
this is a maxi dress I think this is
lovers and friends
is that yes I like going all into the
lovers and for the maxi dresses so it's
a very simple I mean it doesn't look
simple now but basically these go over
the shoulders and these are hanging off
the shoulders and then it's a long maxi
dress but I just loved the print of this
and I cannot wait to wear this in the
Hamptons and this is from Chula Rosa
it's a bikini bottom high-waisted look
at the detail how cute is that blue
stripes with little pink pom poms little
triangle top I love it
unlevel pom pom
oh just throw nice so it's a pair of new
heels and they tie around your leg we
have a very simple strap thicker heel so
I think there'd be a little bit more
comfy and just very simple I love these
so much and I ordered a few things from
street people so this is not for the
Hamptons but I am planning on using
these for teasing very short that Kyle's
with a skirt look sweetie I love the
color as you can tell I'm kind of into
greens lately oversized dress shirt kind
of thing this is going to be impossible
for you guys to get to see it but it's
loose it has detailing here I would have
it obviously unbuttoned and tucked into
like high-waisted shorts or something
but I love this color and I love the
looseness of the sleeves I got the gray
sweater but it's like white gray and
it's really cool right look at the
detail I don't own anything like this I
thought this would be perfect for
traveling so that's why I got it on the
airplane it's super soft feels very
vintage like not does it feel vintage
but it reminds me something vintage
speaking of vintage I got two top from
Frankie collective you guys know that's
my go-to safe to get vintage stuff like
the sweater is from my
so I always order online from them so
the first one is this kind of torn up
vintage Tommy Hilfiger tea that's super
baggy and oversized has a wrist I
thought this would be perfect for
lounging around in or wearing over my
bikini when I go places because it's
really big and baggy is also Tommy and
as you can see it's a little torn up
which is pretty cool I like it
last package guys okay where the
scissors now I lost those oh I got a
pair of bends so everyone has elastic oh
yeah okay are there no laces oh there
are it's just a time up everyone has
those classic bend but I got the
platform version how nice are these I
just need to do up the laces oh yeah
these are sweet I actually got the kids
version because I can wear kid shoes and
they're like so much cheaper than the
regular ones you just get a bigger size
and kid shoes who piece it so cute and
love these I think this with shorts like
this or the sweater
you guys know my style by now cooking
well that's everything that I recently
purchased I'm so excited to go to the
Hamptons I will actually be there or
leaving to go there while this video
