weeks I have been doing a lot of
shopping like a crazy amount of shopping
so like I was doing my normal amount of
shopping but then Black Friday hit with
amazing sales and basically lasted all
weekend and then there was Cyber Monday
and I was just like oh my gosh I'm going
crazy and looking back now I cannot even
understand the amount of money I've
spent but it's all clothing I love Plus
yes I know my hair looks a little cray
it's tucked into my hoodie but I think
it looks kind of cute so I'm gonna keep
it like this and it kind of looks like I
have short hair but like two strands
since I did purchase a lot of things
this haul is really gonna be super long
so instead of showing everything and
making like a 40-minute long haul I'm
gonna split it up into two hauls plus I
haven't really received everything that
I purchased from Cyber Monday so I want
to be able to show you guys all of that
so I'm gonna do a part two closer to
Christmas so hope you guys enjoy and
without further ado let's just get into
it because it's literally gonna be so
long if I don't okay starting off with
topi calm if you guys didn't know if you
purchase off Toby calm your like first
time you get 50% off I'm plus they have
like amazing sales and everything so I
purchased this maybe like two weeks ago
it's just a simple cable knit sweater
it's like a big thick knit looks like
this and it's super comfortable and it's
just really thick and warm and I love
pairing this with like a big chunky
scarf and a beanie I think it looks
super cute oh by the way this haul is
gonna be mainly sweaters I'm just
letting you know I have an obsession
with sweaters so if you like sweaters
stay tuned because there are a lot ok
next moving on to brandy melville brandy
their Black Friday sale was like 10
percent off everything which honestly
kind of sucked but it's still really
cute things so the first thing I got was
this cropped like forest green sweater
they have these and a bunch of colors
but I really like the forest green for
some reason because I find this with
high-waisted black jeans just looks
really good together and they like just
really like Christmas
see and this sweater is so soft inside
prop sweaters are definitely a must for
this time of year
speaking of crop sweaters I picked up
this amazingly a beautiful dark gray
almost black knit sweater I just love
this so much it's like super soft and
big and it's not like so cropped that
you need to wear super high waisted
jeans if you just wear regular like semi
high-waisted it doesn't show any skin if
you want to wear regular low-rise jeans
then this will probably would show but
even this with like a high-waisted skirt
would be so cute
I like love this color I don't know why
it's just it's so nice and then a
sweater that's like super similar to
that like the same exact material but
not as crop is this one from brand-new
as well and it's just a light gray
sweater but this one is way longer I
like wearing this with boyfriend jeans I
find it looks super cute together I
posted a picture wearing this on
snapchat with some booties and everyone
like I think I got like 100 screenshots
like so many of you guys are
screenshotting it's those like oh okay
well that's a cute sweater and I also
posted this on Instagram and a lot of
you seem to like it it's just super
comfortable and I find this sweater
actually looks really nice with like a
collared shirt underneath we're having
the caller kind of peek out because the
neckline isn't too big and then with a
statement necklace it looks super cute
then I got two t-shirts from Brandi and
they honestly look the exact same as the
ones from Topshop but they're like half
the price they're like 20 bucks and the
less we talk shop partly way more than
that so the first one I got was this
grey one it's just a cropped t-shirt but
the material is like I don't know if you
can see on camera but it's like a ribbed
material and it's just like super
stretchy super soft I don't know how to
explain this material like it's just
amazing it's like structured but not
like like this never wrinkles you know
what I mean and it's just a simple gray
t-shirt with high-waisted black jeans
this so cute and some choker necklaces
your hair in like a really messy side
braid I think looks so amazing and I'm
so excited to wear this more during the
holidays then I picked up the exact same
one in maroon because I thought it was
super pretty as you can see it's
literally the same exact thing like this
but um it's maroon and I love it and the
last thing I got from brandy melville is
this sweater that like reminds me of the
sweaters you wear when you go skiing if
you guys go skiing you'll know what I'm
talking about it's just a turtleneck
sweater it's not a turtleneck like huge
like this it's just a simple turtleneck
kind of big it's black long sleeves and
it's sort of cropped but not really and
this looks really tight but it's
actually not that tight when you wear it
and it has a lot of room for like
movement and stuff and it just like it's
so cute on with some black jeans because
I mean I wear all black everything but
even if you had like really dark blue
jeans with rips or you know those black
jeans that are skinny with like all the
rips in the front I think that would
look so sick with these and black
booties like all black every day moving
on to Windsor I showed you guys this
scarf I got from Windsor in my November
favorites if you are interested in
seeing it I will link it down below
because that scarf is like my all-time
favorite but I'm not gonna show anything
security showed it to you but another
thing that I've been loving is this top
from Windsor it's like a long sleeve
kind of similar to the material of the
shirts I just showed you from brandy
it's like that I don't know what it is
kind of stretchy super soft material it
looks it's just a long sleeve shirt
that's kind of like I don't know if you
guys could see that but I will
definitely like link pictures here I
don't do guys like when I do Tryon halls
or do you like when I insert pictures
because I mean I take detailed pictures
for Instagram so it's like why would I
fill myself and I take specific picture
do you I mean but if you guys want me to
do more trying hauls it if you want my
part to have me actually wear them like
video shot of it let me know because I
will do that for you if you guys want
this one is just like a white and black
simple really big neckline
long-sleeve shirt it's kind of lower in
the back then is in the front and it
also goes up on the slides but I think
it's really flattering you can wear this
with literally any bottoms and it looks
cute then the next thing from Windsor is
this it's this gray sweatshirt kind of
thing oh my gosh this is gonna be so
hard to explain but you'll see from the
picture it's like okay first of all it's
a turtleneck and then has these two
strings that you can like pull to make
the turtle night tighter if you wanted
to it kind of looks like a hoodie but
it's like super long like you can wear
this as a dress and it's super baggy but
it gets tighter on the ends of the
sleeves and then it goes out and like
that wing you know so it's super baggy
so soft and this color gray is so
flattering I don't know what it is but
every time I wear this color brag I love
compliments especially with some like
simple you know light pink lips or some
knobby lips I think it looks super cute
and the last thing I got from Windsor is
definitely my favorite thing of all I
love it so much it is this baseball tee
that's crop but it's really really loose
and the sleeves are so soft Randy has
similar tops but they're very very like
structured and form-fitting and this one
is just like super loose and baggy and I
really like it it's crop and not like
crazy crop like you could get away
wearing normal jeans with this and it
would look perfectly fine I like how big
the neckline is and I just feel like a
boy when I wear this and I honestly I'm
so obsessed with it this was a beanie is
like my favorite thing to wear a black
beanie I love it and just some regular
jeans again like I wear jeans and
everything
speaking of jeans I got these jeans from
free people I'm now moving on to my free
peoples stuff because I have made such
big orders on free people because of
their sales we're just crazy they have
really good sales I'm gonna few guys
checked it out but basically I have
these high-waisted blue jeans they're
just like pretty high-waisted like the
Topshop ones they showed in my previous
video but they're dark blue which I
really like because I honestly don't own
any like dark blue jeans I was looking
through my closet and I was just like I
have black and black and black and but I
can plug them back in black one maroon
and a few like distressed light Jean but
I don't have any dark Jean I was like oh
and I'm in either the dark Jean so
actually wear these like kind of cuffed
ups to show but if the ankle the pockets
on it are super nice and like I have
said many times in my videos before but
Free People jeans are like the most
comfortable jeans ever and they're
around the same price point as Topshop
so if you guys are looking into
investing in some really nice jeans I
would have to say free people because
they do last a lot longer I've owned
some three people jeans for like the
past five years and I still wear them
the next thing I got for free people is
of course of something that looks like a
man but it's just an oversized dress
shirt like this and it's super long in
the back it goes like really below your
butt and the sleeves are just loose the
buttons in the front
don't go down all the way and then they
have these pockets on each bootie
basically I honestly like wearing this
with overalls I know that sounds so like
probably not your style but I love
overalls like I could live in overalls
so my last sweater item is this sweater
from Free People
and it's just a like big v-neck ivory
sweater and the sleeves are pretty tight
but they're not too tight and it's a
pretty long sweater it's just a simple
ivory sweater but I find these sweaters
so perfect for this time of year because
I honestly love wearing white or ivory
like creamy off-white during the winter
I think it looks so nice and especially
this with my big three people red scarf
that's like plaid oh this one right here
on my bed I love wearing those two
together I think it's so pretty and this
is just like so soft and so comfortable
the material is amazing it's like so
squishy it feels like a cloud this is
like what I would consider a cloud to
feel like and the last thing I purchased
on Free People is this same exact color
as the sweater I just showed you but
it's a t-shirt and the neckline goes
like this it's pretty long so you can
wear it off the shoulder if you wanted
to and it's like I don't know it's
called circle and Asante and it's just
like I don't know how to swing this it's
super high low and it's very flowy and I
showed it in a lookbook and you guys
seem to be obsessed with it and there
are so many colors in this t-shirt and
it's actually pretty affordable but I
love it I got it in a size extra small
small and it's still super big on me so
they are made really big but this color
is so nice and I love wearing this with
a choker necklace which I'll show you in
a second but this with a leather jacket
or a jean jacket and some really nice
tailored pants and some booties are so
cute onto jewelry I have three things to
show you guys the first being this
choker that I got from Free People it's
by a Vanessa Mooney but I got it on the
website from three people and it's just
a simple
gold collar choker but not like up
against your neck like a kind of sits
lower I'll insert a picture but
basically it's adjustable so you can
actually bend this in the way that
shapes your neck I like the little
pendant thats hanging down right here I
think it's super subtle and add
something a little bit different I like
wearing it with a t-shirt I just showed
you from three people I think it's super
dainty and nice and yeah I love it
the next thing is a choker by nomadic
store you guys all know I love nomadic
store and this one is just a simple
chain choker but the pendant on it is
like this turquoise little stone and I
think it's so pretty I know I really
like this one a lot
it's just dainty and simple and then the
last thing I got is this necklace from
Vanessa Mooney and it's just a velvet
choker necklace and it's very stretchy
like you could literally also has a
chain too it's super adjustable very
comfortable I got a lot of compliments
on it when I wear it and I think it
looks super cool this would like a
really nice simple dress I think looks
so cool or even a romper because it kind
of just edges up your outfit and makes
it look very different and then with
some really high booties I think it's
super cute now the last two items I have
to show you our shoes that I got I want
to show you three but I already showed
one of them in my November favorites you
guys I'm sure you know which boots I'm
talking about but I will link it down
below like I said if you are interested
there from Matisse Footwear they're
literally my new favorite boots like I
wear them almost every single day I love
them and then the other boots I got from
Matisse Footwear a lot of you guys are
asking me are these booties these are so
cool they're like a dark rayon
blue tinge I don't know if it's making
it funky camera but they look like kind
of like pure pan shoes like I just think
they look super cool and the heel it's
like a wedge so they're super
comfortable to walk in but it almost is
not a wedge I'm not these guys know I'm
telling them but they're so cool and
they're very comfortable I can wear them
all day and my feet don't hurt I just
find these look it's super good with any
kind of outfit to be honest like they're
so simple that they go with anything
even this sweater right now which I'm
wearing it's from Windsor it looks super
cute with just some plain jeans and
these love it now the last item I have
to show you I have to warn you they're
very different and they might not be
everyone's cup of tea but they are
definitely my cup of tea they're so cool
so they are these booties by Sam Edelman
I love Sam Edelman I think his shoes are
super cool I got these awesome daily
look and I love daily look bro it's like
the best website has so much stuff on it
basically these look like my
grandfather's shoes I'm not even kidding
you they're so cool one side you have a
zipper like this you have a short super
chunky heel I love this because it makes
the boot so super comfortable but what I
think are so cool about these are like
the sides I think they're super edgy
looking because of the buckles but then
the best part is the front it's super
pointy but there's fur right here on the
front how freaking cool is that like I
know like fur on boots it's like a super
big trend right now and if you guys
could see it but I just think they're
super cool and super comfortable these
with some ripped up black skinny jeans
rolled up so you see the ankle and like
a really cool grungy like t-shirt with a
leather jacket I think is like so my
style and I can so see Cara Delevingne
wearing these I just think they're like
supercool I love them so much and yeah
like definitely something that I'm super
excited to wear more of because I lose I
love them so much like if you guys
