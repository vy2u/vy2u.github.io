my winter haul part 2 video because you
guys asked me to film that and it's
taking me a while but I've been waiting
for so many shipments to come in by the
way my hair is just in a this like
half-up half-down messy but i don't know
what's going on in it just like anyways
let's get into the video I have so many
things to show you okay starting off
with Jack fennec I have like shown you
guys Jack my neck so many times
especially in the summer I love her
stuff and I got a shipment in the other
day and I want to show you because I
love everything so much so the first
thing I wanted to show you is this like
set piece you know when you get like a
skirt and a top
really Pat's on top that match this is
at the top it's like super super cool
it's different looking I love the colors
of it and it comes with these like
bell-bottom hands that are awesome and
the materials look really comfortable
and I just think these two together are
so nice and then also this would like
some high-waisted jeans shorts or even
pads it's just so hot I love it together
and alone they're just awesome plus the
colors are really complementing I really
like them this sweater her sweaters are
so soft they really remind me of brandy
sweaters like they're just really soft
and comfortable and this one's a bit
oversized and it says roses are red
violets are blue whiskey is cheaper than
dinner for two and I thought that it's
so funny it's just like a simple black
nut hoodie but like jumper and I think
graphics are fun sometimes and I really
like this one plus it's super soft and
then moving on to the next jumper which
I've shown this in my winter essentials
video plus on Instagram and it's just
this simple jumper that has matching
pants as well but I just like the jumper
on its own and on the back it says be
brave and be comfy kind I really like
that message plus this is just super
like I don't know I like wearing this
with black jeans and stuff and even just
at home
it's super comfortable then next onto
the more scandalous piece that I got is
this velvet for small velvet it's just
like awesome it's a deep V dress and
this dress goes all the way down to the
floor and it's really long but the best
part about it is that it is open back so
you guys can see it's open back it's
super long like it goes all the way down
to the floor super flattering I
absolutely love it and just the like
hold velvet feel of it it's just super
sleek and sexy love it and the last item
from Jeff Fenech is this a backpack
which is super cool and I actually last
summer I saw so many people like
traveling around Central America that
we're wearing like just different color
cool backpacks and they obviously got
them there but this really reminded me
of it plus it says later nerds with an
alien on it like Hello how awesome is
that
and this is just so cute like you guys
know me I love backpacks I just really
like backpacks this is just like I like
that just a different one I just thought
it was really cool might not be
everyone's cup of tea but it's
definitely something that I think is
really awesome moving on I did a big
pretty big shipment on Windsor actually
well not pretty big but like there's
things on the winter that I've been
loving I love their winter line right
now I think it's so awesome so the first
thing I picked up was this burgundy hi I
just wanted a simple burgundy hat and I
looked around everywhere even a forever
21 I just couldn't find one for some
reason like none of them were selling
burgundy hats and then I saw it on the
Windsor and I was like yes plus this one
has a little bit of sparkle in it and
it's just a simple like tube but you can
have it like as a floppy hat like
hanging down in the back you know little
hipster but I really like this then I
got this choker necklace if you guys
know I love me some chokers but I
thought this was just a simple sweater
or like white t-shirt on would just look
really nice I actually saw
missglamorazzi where a similar choker
hers I think is from the bauble bar but
this is like
literally half the price it's like so
affordable it's so nice you can
obviously just move it it's super easy
to move and you couldn't obviously you
could put your neck in it some people
like to wear it so like this part shows
in the front but I personally just like
to hide that and show just like the ring
around and it kind of sits low where
like I'll show you guys just like this
obviously I wouldn't wear it with this
shirt that's something a bit more like
around this and you could just see the
simplicity of it I think it's so nice
normally when jewellery if it's not real
my skin reacts pretty badly to it but
for some reason I could wear this and
that's totally fine then the next thing
I got was this super soft really
comfortable scarf I love it I think it's
like the best thing ever we really not
that like smelt good when I took it out
the box but it's just an infinity scarf
like this it's super big and chunky and
so soft I love the material of this and
I just really like it a lot I don't
excited to wear that for the wintertime
then next is this sweater that I got
from Windsor as well and this is just a
walnut striped simple jumper it's really
comfortable and I don't know I like
stripes I'm wearing stripes right now as
you can see and I really like a lot and
it's simple but that's what I like
wearing those with some high-waisted
black jeans rips in the knees and
booties it's just like amazing I love it
then the next thing I got from Windsor
is a simple cable knit sweater
this one is a cream color and I liked it
cause it likes a little v-neck it's
super soft super comfortable so
affordable I love their knits it doesn't
cover my butt or anything which is
totally fine especially with cream I
really like wearing this with like
boyfriend jeans I think it looks super
good with like dark-wash boyfriend jeans
and booties so hot would like your hair
and a messy half a bun like this I think
it looks awesome
then the last thing I got from Windsor
is definitely it might not be everyone's
favorite thing but I absolutely love it
and it's just like this poncho I don't
know it rise are something you get at
Topshop but it's just like this poncho
like cape thing and it has a hood and
then throw it around and it has this
like little buckle here so you can
buckle that up and then you have this
Cape thing and it's like super warm and
comfortable
I love the plaid pattern and it's simple
like it's black and gray but then it has
like red little red lines that go
through it which is super nice I have so
much stuff to show you and I just feel
like my halls can drag on for so long
next I guess I'll show Brandi I didn't
get really too much of Brandi I just did
a quick to stop in the other day and I
got sucked into buying a turtleneck what
huh no I feel like guilty showing you
guys because I just can't stop buying
turtlenecks you know I'm gonna do I
think I'm gonna go through all my
turtleneck sweaters and then I'm gonna
decide which ones I absolutely need and
then which ones I like don't wear as
often like or worn once and I never wear
them again and maybe I'll do a giveaway
I don't really know what do you guys
think I feel bad giving you clothing
that I've worn so maybe I'll go through
the stuff and like look at the things
I've worn once
don't worry either clean I don't smell
or anything I'm not any kind of weird
thing but I do want to get rid of some
stuff I just like so much anyways
showing you guys another channel neck
sweater this one from brandy melville I
love it because it's just simple gray
turtleneck sweater but it's long you can
like literally wear this as a dress I
probably wouldn't personally I would
wear it with like five high socks and
maybe some shorts underneath just in
case because I am quite tall so that
would be pretty awkward but I do love
this a lot I love the feeling of it it's
just super simple classic gray
turtleneck sweater I have like three of
the exact same ones just different
lengths so yay Alex for buying a million
turtleneck sweaters and 19
the obsession is real guys and I need to
stop because it's just getting too much
moving on the next thing for brandy I
just got was a simple hat because I just
really like this hi and I don't know why
I bought it
I needed a black eye like a dark grey
hat and I didn't have one and I saw it
there and I was like I bought it that's
all it is it's just a simple hat you can
roll it up or you don't need to you
could just have it more flimsy and
floppy but it's a cable knit material so
it's a bit different than the other
halves own and I don't know I really
like it the next thing I got is from the
website revolt clothing and they sent me
just a few things and I honestly love
that website I've said it before to you
guys but revolt clothing is awesome they
have like all of my favorite designers
and I don't know I feel like I save up
money to like go on that website but
basically I am going to Barbados next
week if you guys didn't know I don't
think I've actually announced it yet but
maybe on my vlogging channel if you guys
want to have like a channel you should
check that out but I'm going to Barbados
next week with Daniel and since it is
warmer weather this isn't really like a
winter item but for those of you that
live in a warmer climate this would be
applicable to you guys but I got these
boyfriend jean shorts now you might
think what the hell are those but these
are amazing they sit lower on your waist
and this part here is like super baggy
so it just makes your legs look super
long and skinny and I just love it not
that your legs need to be skinny it's
just like it makes them look so long I
don't know why normally boyfriend jeans
make your legs look shorter but I've
paired it with like a really like grungy
looking white tee and some heels and I
would like oh my god I need to wear this
especially with a 10 like below these
are the pockets and thereby the bread
lovers and friends and I love lovers and
friends um I think their stuff is
awesome so
this is what I got and I like the color
of it it'll look nice with the ten I'm
excited to wear these in Barbados and
the next thing I got is from the Brad
for love and lemons and it is this crop
fuzzy sweater like look how amazing this
is I've know about you guys but I am
definitely a fan of wearing crop
sweaters in the wintertime I know some
of you might think I'm crazy because I
live in a climate that's like freezing
cold but when I'm outside I'm wearing a
really warm jacket so it's not like I'm
gonna be partying it up outside of this
like crop sweater like hey guys check it
out you know crazy person but I actually
wear this indoors with high-waisted
jeans believe it or not and guess what
when you're inside there's Keating's so
it doesn't matter what you wear really
but I just really like this I think it's
super fuzzy and comfortable and warm and
amazing and I love the color this like
royal or navy blue color it's just super
flattering on the skintone I love it I
haven't posted picture it by the time
you guys watch this I'm sure I wouldn't
post a picture but I took a picture in
this and I just know the comments are
gonna be like aren't you cold aren't you
cold like yes it was cold bring us
outside but I loved it and I was cold my
stomach was cold but everywhere else was
just warm because it's amazing and the
material of this it's the same as my
other for lovin Lemmons sweater it's
just like the softest material ever like
I don't know how to explain it it's like
stretchy and soft and comfortable but
for love and lemons knits are like
different than anything I've ever owned
picture like a super soft cloud and
that's what this is just saying then the
last thing I got was this and this is a
oversized denim jacket from Urban
Outfitters it's just a really light blue
and it's just like super baggy and
oversized and it reminds me of the 90s
or the 80s I love it so much and I
usually have it with the sleeves rolled
up it's by Levi's it's like a vintage
Levi's jacket it's a size large and I
got it because of the oversized miss of
it and I think wearing this with like a
really loose
grungy top underneath with my hair like
this or even just like a top not with
some like distressed denim and some
booties it's just like my style I love
it that look is just so nice or even you
know those like t-shirt dresses from
brandy melville with a stripe so you can
get them in any color basically that
with this jacket and some like thick
chunky booties oh my gosh and a choker I
love it
guys that style I love it so much and I
yes I do wear this in the winter
