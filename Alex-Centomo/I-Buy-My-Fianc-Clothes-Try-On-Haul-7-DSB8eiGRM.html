my channel I'm here today with Dan again
what's up Dan thanks for doing a Q&amp;amp;A
we're actually not doing any we're doing
a challenge video what's the challenge
oh it's not really a challenge I guess I
don't know it's like the tag thing going
on so it's not like a pie in your face
crazy thing no no no a few when was it a
month ago we did you buy my outfit oh
did you buy me clothes oh no that's why
there were so many boxes that you
weren't opening and I was like oh
there's a box from All Saints did you
buy me something and she's like no I'll
see it's a girl store I was like no it's
not so dumb because you literally own
stuff from all say awesome so I don't
know why I said that I like God I have
freaked out I was like oh my god what do
I say and then yeah when I put out that
video where he bought my clothes the
most requested thing was for me to buy
his clothes and at first I was like no
I'm not gonna do that because of all the
times I do buy his clothes or we'll go
shopping together and he'll pick out the
stuff he likes I know what he likes and
stuff so I figured there's still a lot
of things that I know would look really
good on dad and I know he would never
pick out and I would never buy for him
because I know he wouldn't like it but I
do think it's gonna look good on you so
and I think that if you do wear it you
will like it it's just for me clothes
it's it's like honestly I don't know
until I'm wearing it because all my
clothes if I feel comfortable in it then
I'm good yeah but if I feel a little
weird like it doesn't suit me or I don't
know if I'd like it then right away I'm
like I won't like this
sorry boo is right below us so I guess
this is kind of like a fall fall themed
fall themed because obviously it's full
time so I bought all his clothes that
could go for this weather I'll be right
back I'm gonna get the boxes so I know
hi did you open this one and put other
ones in it yeah so we have lots of boxes
is their preferred brand you won't open
first there's not should I pull it out
without looking
what you want to do this feels really
fluffy mmm is this for you or for me for
both of us
oh that looks cozy ah I think I'll like
that what size is it large exhale I'm
not sure with sweaters and all all the
times it's like yeah sweaters I don't
mind if they're a little bit oversized
this doesn't look huge we'll have to try
it on but I like it I mean if it fits
I'm gonna like it for sure and it feels
like tingly yeah it's mohair what does
that mean it's a type of wool yeah it
looks so good though it's also because
I'm kind of hot so I'm kind of sweating
oh I don't know if I like this though
okay but look wise look wise it's great
and fit wise it's actually really nice
really making me at you because online
here online the guy was wearing but
the fit and the look and the color
that's great oh no there's a few more
this is definitely different this is
very different
I'm open to trying it but I don't know
it's good it all depends on how it feels
like weird like I said I think these are
gonna look so good on you especially
with your like booties are they kind of
cropped are they like they're not
cropped but they don't like I guess
there's like floods yeah you know that
could freeze but they're not like yeah I
do not know your size for this so we'll
see about that well the size is good are
they supposed to be like snug or like
that is what you wear it with a belt
yeah yeah I put a belt on obviously BAM
check it sex-bomb oh my gosh 10 and I
thought even the loafers it would be
really cute yeah oh that's shoes I feel
shoes in here these the loafers just
talking about wow those are nice you
like those Wow those are really nice
holy cow I really like that do you
actually I do
I mean I'll have to see once they're on
but I think those are gonna look really
nice I thought these even with jeans
that are rolled like no no socks no
socks showing like lololo socks with
jeans that are rolled up or even those
pants
mm-hmm ignore the song you won't see it
when your pants are down I know but
still even if I was sitting you would
see would lift but oh my gosh these are
so nice but I kind of like my socks show
yeah but no it socks with a feel oh no
no they were just like dressed saw yeah
yeah these are really nice they're
comfortable no I like tight sweaters
like this hundred percent I normally go
as long as it fits but I know yeah I'm
gonna like that for sure there's so many
things that I get him that I'm like whoo
I'm gonna borrow that like a sweater
especially if you buy from me or do you
buy for you no I buy for you and we can
match you don't I'm gonna have to do
though cuz now I'm starting to get a
more new clothes I'm gonna have to clean
out my my clothes and get rid of some of
the stuff that I don't wear yeah well we
can donate with me when I'm doing my
stuff
what's daddy wearing I'm trying on a
whole bunch of new clothes next video is
buying clothes for boo dust all over it
I don't know if this is too small but
this is how I would like my sweaters no
that's good it's more fitted but this is
not like a sweater it's like a knit yeah
that makes it but this is this is more
comfortable to me I feel more
comfortable in my own skin when I wear
this compared to the big baggy ones I'm
just not used to wearing big baggy ones
this is exactly what I would wear this
is perfect I like this one a lot he
looks handsome right boo-boo
100% yes to this mm-hmm
I love those pants on you Dan and the
shoes and everything it's kind of got a
Chuck Bass feel sure but a little bit
you know I mean he doesn't whisper I
just keep looking at your butt
those not in you always has huge collars
with a suit or like this tie knotted
massive I never used up a full closet I
said like no for another is our box here
we're gonna not look for this one again
oh yeah oh this feels like a big coat is
gonna be nice I thought this is really
good for the fall time and like November
like transitioning into winter this is
beautiful oh my god I can't wait to wear
the troll tamer do you actually like
this I wasn't sure I was gonna feel when
we were in Amsterdam I wanted a coat
like this and I was looking at all the
vintage but I thought you wanted more
but the Balmer type no I'm not happen I
have like a suede bomber
I like fitted jackets like this like
they're kind of more more slim on the
way you try everything on oh that's so
nice
no this is really nice like I wouldn't
wear it with this shirt because it's no
hoax oh you like that yeah and has
pockets too yeah I really like this oh
yeah this is so nice
it's so warm too on the inside and low
distress looking you know if I get looks
vintage even though it's not it's so
nice I also just realized my pants are
literally below my butt look you have a
coin slot my butt crack is a the canal
so All Saints is almost always a
guaranteed thing that I'll like it's in
another day I also forgot what I got you
because it's been so long oh oh it's
like a turtleneck sweater what the heck
that's it hi okay so this is not a
turtleneck you actually have this open
and okay I was gonna say this kid
affected my nose but no this is really
nice and it's really soft
oh and it's a little bit of the stress
on the bottom few rips and stuff come on
this one's nice I'm not sure I'm not
sure how to wear it it's definitely nice
it's just I don't know how to wear the
neck this looks nice yeah I like this
one I like it a lot I got it you just
leave it open like that on the neck all
right I like this dressing yeah this is
nice I like this one it's a little weird
I think you look really which is
different I like it though feel this
oh wow like dents oh this one's nice
yeah this one's pretty nice - I know
it's the style to be bagged here like
this it's not my preference but this
one's pretty good
I love it I like it you do you got me
all sweaters which is good
I thought the jacket you weren't gonna
like no I like it's a lot better than
the other one you bought me the shoes in
the pants attack the shoes and the shoes
I like just it's gonna be a matter of
like finding things to match up them hey
another sweater cool it's like kind of
what are the colors in here oh wow it's
like purple green yellow yellow I like
it soft too it's big yeah it's a good
thing I'm wearing jeans because I can
just throw on one sweater at a time oh
that's cute see I love lanes of sweaters
like this on dad he doesn't but I think
it looks really good it's not the length
it's more like I don't like when it
feels like a balloon around my waist but
it does style for me it's so comfortable
right yeah I don't like if I wear a
sweater and I open my arms like this not
that I do this you know a lot but I
don't like when it's too boxy this one
is like borderline it's nice though I
really like the fit and the color I like
it so I hope you guys enjoyed this video

a whole as a whole like 9 like a 10
