channel I'm here again with my little
boo boo he's sitting next to me so this
video I've actually been seeing around
YouTube a lot lately and how I actually
discovered this video with someone did
it of me and then tweeted me so that was
really cool you did an awesome job and
if you guys don't know what this video
is I don't really know who invented it
if I figure out who it was all like
leave the person's channel link down in
the description and if you guys don't
sit in the description you know who it
is leave it in the comments down below
because I definitely want to give credit
I just don't know who started this video
but it's definitely like pretty popular
right now on YouTube and I thought it
was cool because I find them really
entertaining and so I've always kind of
wanted to do one I just didn't know of
who but then I discovered someone on
Instagram recently like I'm talking a
week and a half ago and I've been
obsessed with her pictures her pictures
are completely different than mine and I
thought it would be a kind of a little
challenge for myself to take pictures
like her so I happened to be in LA when
I was starting to film this and I
noticed a lot of her pictures were taken
in LA so I thought why not try there and
then continue when I'm at home this
isn't a full week I didn't do every
single picture perfectly but I did it to
the best of my ability and I'm
definitely gonna rate myself her name is
Matilda and ol 10th ole I think she's
beautiful you guys should definitely go
follow her on Instagram she's like
blowing up now her pictures are stunning
this is definitely like a lot different
than pictures I normally take if you
guys are doing my channel make sure to
subscribe down below and while you're
down there make sure to hit that Bell
notification so you get your post
notifications turn on for what I upload
so you guys never miss a video and also
give this video a thumbs up if you want
me to recreate more people's instagrams
more people's and scrums that sometimes
made no sense do you guys know what I
mean like if you want me to do Kyle or
Tess or anyone like leave it down below
I think that would be really fun if you
guys are curious to see how I recreated
her pictures in my own way then keep on
watching starting off with picture
number one so the first picture I decide
to take was this photo that I
on her Instagram page and I thought this
picture is really cool but it's so
different that anything I've done and
it's like very out-there so I was like
I'm gonna try it and see if I could do
it because we had a very similar balcony
in our hotel room so I was like why not
I had a similar bodysuit so the first
picture I'm gonna try and recreate is
something similar to this obviously it's
like very exposed but I have a very
similar view right now with my hotel so
I think in a bit I'm going to try to
recreate this I was similar bodysuit in
a calf and my hair is not straight but I
still think I could do something kind of
similar and see how that looks I have my
hat on
I have my bodysuit we have this balcony
right here with the hills in the
background I think would look really
nice palm tree this balcony with the
hills in the background kind of this
similar
this
okay guys I think we got the shot so I
thought I did a pretty good job I
obviously don't know exactly how she
edits but I took all the pictures on my
phone and I edited only using my phone
and so the apps that I used were
Lightroom facetune and vsco and then
also a snap see not Snapseed after light
those four apps are what I used for
every single picture normally I have
been editing on Lightroom on my computer
for my pictures but that's a whole new
video I will do eventually of how to
edit my Instagram pictures yeah this is
what I got obviously it's not exact
because I didn't have the palm tree and
we weren't standing the exact same
location but I thought I did a pretty
good job like maybe our faces weren't
exactly the same but the pose the outfit
the hat the scenery I thought I did
really well so I'm gonna give myself a 9
on 10 because I feel like taking a 10 on
10 would be if I was literally standing
in the exact same location but I thought
I did pretty good so thank you cat for
helping me take the picture as for the
next two photos I had two photos in mind
that I wanted to take in Santa Monica
and I knew exactly where she took them
and I thought oh my god this is gonna be
perfect it's on the beach we'll go at
sunset I'll be able to get the exact
same pictures in the same location
obviously I don't have the exact same
bathing suit but I thought why not try
shots here what she did so I'm going to
show you guys okay so basically she was
like right here when it were she took
the picture and so this is what we're
gonna do okay pretend like you're posing
what I didn't anticipate we decided to
go on a Sunday because it was the only
day we were able to go and it was packed
and it was really awkward because
normally I don't care about being in a
bikini on a beach but no when I was in
their bikinis because it's obviously
middle of the winter but for me it's
still warm outside because I'm from
Canada it was kind of funny cuz I was
like getting into my bathing suit and of
course we were standing right next to
the boardwalk and so all these guys were
standing there like whistling making
really inappropriate comments a few of
them
up to us so I just felt really
uncomfortable to take the pictures but
guys I don't think I'll be able to take
pictures in a bikini that's so freakin
awkward first of all all these like
dudes like whistling at me as I'm trying
to do it and like making me just so
uncomfortable and then coming over to us
hitting on us it just makes me feel
awkward so I don't think I wanna do a
bikini shot but I'm gonna do something
similar yeah making my own doesn't have
to be exact because like I mean that's
my own fault for picking a person who
like just post bikini shots but I just
really love the picture so I try to make
it my own so I decided to just keep my
pants on the picture isn't exact but I'm
gonna give myself extra points for being
in the same location so these are our
photos together as you can see obviously
they're not exact because I'm not
wearing the same outfit as her at all I
did have like a full outfit that I was
gonna wear and I just felt really
uncomfortable so I thought whatever I'm
in the same location it was at sunset I
did a pretty good job the Edit isn't
exactly the same but I thought it was
pretty similar so I'm gonna give myself
a 7 on 10 for this I feel like I
probably would have given myself a 9 on
10 if I was fully in a bikini that's
fine and then same as the second picture
I'll put them both together
so it wasn't exactly in the same place
as her and there were a lot more people
and obviously she's on a skateboard and
she's in a bathing suit yeah I just felt
so uncomfortable especially with
everyone there and like everyone making
comments and no one was innovating suit
so I was like like the pose and stuff
was pretty good and the Edit was pretty
similar so I'm gonna give myself five
point five on ten for this just for the
effort then I got home and I decided to
try a picture of her in bed it was so
cute I thought it was so effortless and
just like awesome but then it took me
like 30 minutes to get the picture so
dad obviously took it with my phone and
it looked so casual the way she was
lying there but every time I would just
lie there I literally look like a potato
and I was like how the heck does someone
just lie there so cute so I was like
really posing flexing holding everything
together making it look cute but like it
was so hard man it really goes to show
you what people do for pictures cuz I
just looked at it and thought well
that's so cute it's so effortless and
then oh my god to get that picture was
so hard it was like the hardest picture
and like all I was doing was lying in
bed these are the two pictures side by
side come on guys I think I did a pretty
good job with that one you know it's not
exact obviously a bit more of my butt
was showing and like and it is not exact
I thought I did a pretty good job so a
for effort for myself I'm gonna give
myself a 9 on 10 because it's not exact
but it's pretty similar and I thought I
did an awesome job and then as for the
last photo I want to do another bed shot
and again something that looked so
effortless took so long to do and this
one is not even close to being exact I
tried my best so here are the pictures
that Polly give myself is 7 on 10 just
cuz the pose was a lot similar but I
thought I did a pretty good job but yeah
that's it for the video I hope you guys
enjoyed it obviously I will have my
video all about hi edit my Instagram
