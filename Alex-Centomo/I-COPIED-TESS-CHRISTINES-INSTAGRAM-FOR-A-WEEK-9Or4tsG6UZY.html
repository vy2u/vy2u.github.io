channel I'm currently just chillin on my
kitchen floor right now because the
lighting in my house is a little crazy I
hope you guys are okay with that I mean
one of my backgrounds ever really
amazing let's be honest so as you can
tell from the title this was a very
requested video I filmed a video like
two months ago copying another
instagramers Instagram pictures and I'll
have that link down below if you want to
see it you guys absolutely loved it and
I asked you in that video who you'd want
to see next and I got so many comments
to do either my sister or Tess and I
happen to be in New York and I was like
you know what I'm just gonna film this
right here because I feel like this
could be kind of fun that's basically it
if you guys are new here make sure to
click that subscribe button down below
as well as turn on the post
notifications so you guys never miss a
video and give this video a thumbs up if
you want me to recreate anyone else's
Instagram Tess is someone who is
probably the kindest most genuine soul I
know she is so hard-working she is so
down to earth she's amazing and this is
all very superficial because I'm just
you know copying the way she looks in a
picture but her personality I find is
just amazing and I'm just really glad to
be her friend and I'm just always in
perpetual all of her would that being
said if you guys don't who she is I'll
have her links down below you guys
should go follow her on Instagram and
subscribe to her on YouTube yeah let's
get started with the first pictures hi
guys so for this first look I'm actually
in New York and this is gonna be a
little bit of a cheat but a pad Tessa's
apartment and I figured it would be
really fun to get a shot so similar to
one of her shots the only difference is
that I don't have a black long-sleeve
shirt when you're recreating pictures
and I do this all the time just in real
life if I get inspiration from pictures
I don't like to do something exact I
like to do like kind of put my own twist
on it obviously I'm not brunette
obviously we don't look anything alike
I'm wearing a long sleeve of white shirt
but it's still a little bit higher up
the neck and so I thought this would
kind of be similar in like my own type
of way making the picture really cute
clearly you don't need to be like in the
exact location but I thought this would
be fun to go and kind of get something a
lot more similar but I'm gonna have Tess
kind of show you how she likes to pose I
feel like I know her pretty well I feel
like I know how she would pose but I
have to do it first okay I'm gonna try
to like play off as if I'm her posing
I've watched her enough times I think I
know what I'm doing so um good luck to
me down here - but he's scared to step
on the fire escape so we'll see what
happens
it's okay you can be scared of heights
fine I'm scared of spiders and vomit and
life also look how cute they are
oh my goodness okay so this is the
picture I'm going to be trying to
recreate obviously we have completely
different hair I'm not wearing a black
shirt but I'm gonna be in the same
location and I think this picture is so
beautiful this is when you first cut
your hair yeah maybe so you're wearing
the same shirt just white instead of
black yeah I have a belt but whatever
New York I mean should we wait so it's
done yeah maybe I'm not exactly sure
which one okay how was her hair was it's
white on the side kinda Wow car yeah
it's like over both shoulders okay where
this is test posing goodnight my eyes
aren't Lea she's not doing like as much
of an intense face as she is kind of
like a like you never shoulders is up
how does pat get that far back well he's
not scared of heights
sounds weird I can't do that I got this
okay yeah this is more some work yeah
that's pretty cool like this alright
like a little yeah more like that and he
likes I don't think words that open like
slightly yeah that's better
I think that looks similar okay let's
see let's see if we get it guys every
photo oh that's actually super accurate
that's really cool in everything it's
going in check in please
high five done somebody give me a high
five good work I think well I haven't
edited yet but I think that was good
looks good drop a little bit I left a
little too much space on one side thank
you so much thank you so much yeah I'm
so proud of you that you did that
thank you this picture actually turned
out pretty good it's just I could not
get the editing right the lighting
obviously was so much different
she took her picture I think in the fall
this was spring and like there was no
leaves on trees and lighting obviously
the Sun is very different so this is the
picture
I know I know we look nothing alike but
I think I did a pretty good job given
the fact that it was kind of cheating
because I'm like on her staircase and
took the picture in the exact same spot
but that's what I did with the other one
as well and I think I would give myself
like a seven on ten for this just
because I wasn't wearing a black shirt
my hair wasn't straight and the editing
wasn't that similar but I feel like I
did the pose pretty well I tried my best
to do her face and so yeah I give myself
like a good 70% I think that's it's a
given on it to the next picture okay
because I'm too short for anything test
let me her shirt for the next picture
but I actually have the shirt at home so
that or something similar from brandy so
I would have been able to recreate it if
I had brought it I didn't pack properly
because I was so out of it and jet lag
that looks really good big jug of ice
water that's my favorite thing so we're
gonna go and recreate this next look
which I'll show you guys and I'm wearing
or her sneakers just so comfy what brand
are these pens oh so this is the next
picture obviously it's not the summer so
I don't even think me like these bushes
here and I don't have the same jeans but
the same shirt white sneakers her hair
straight mine's not but I think I could
do it somewhat cute I love this all
right so the bushes are a little dead
because the dead of summer
there's no why's she had
her bright hair was in front her left
part was behind and then you had I think
yeah I was like booty-popping trying to
show off my lack of booty yeah exactly
like that yeah yeah yeah yeah exactly
yeah work angle a little bit more more
that way no no no not you her angle your
board like turn towards the fence
otherwise yeah yeah separate your feet
just a bit no that's too much too much
[Laughter]
I'm well is that great I love that
that's Holly
okay I'm way further yeah
and he's doing more of a downward angle
I feel like the pose is dead-on
he's more downwards because he's not
getting above the window very much
mm-hmm oh yeah he has no nothing yeah
exactly so I just have to kind of point
down away yeah lighting work work
you look so pretty I think that's pretty
close your arms are wasting in here oh
my god so this picture again same kind
of thing she took her picture in the
summer I took it almost spring time
there was no leaves but it wasn't the
exact location I tried to get the outfit
as close as hers was I was wearing the
same shirt but again hair was different
and I was wearing like crazy socks and
stuff and that the editing was different
so I tried to make myself look tan
because she was super tan in that
picture but that's because it was the
summertime and I just wasn't tan so I
kind of looked orange but this is the
picture so I give myself probably a
eight on ten for this because I thought
I did a pretty good job oh there's my
sister she just woke up I give her
something to eat on ten just because I
feel like the pose was spot-on
I look pretty similar and Dan did an
amazing job with the angle it was just
like my skin tone and the lighting was
just a little off and there was no
leaves but you know ten pretty good okay
third photo this is like classic
test right outside of New York I mean
it's the summertime so there's no leaves
right now but I have a white tank I have
blue jeans at black boots
her hair is on as you write okay and
then half of it's behind her cool let's
do this Carrie's being test Christine
right now yeah B Carrie OH
oh yeah she got it yeah literally you
stick your hips out and you like suck
your like Chinon or something you're
like what's Julia's 2015 literally know
what's current Alex's that's Alex 2015
[Laughter]
yeah literally oh my god I don't know
how to not stick my tongue out right leg
out and her left hand in her pocket
right I can't fit my hand in my pocket
so make sure he doesn't fit clearly I
would maybe do yeah you could do that
but there is like is there warm-up walk
Alex don't slack I'm just saying and
show the viewers how to make test we've
seen reality you know I like on the line
if your meet us Christine you have to be
amazing smart hard-working and true good
friend
yes try actually walking because I
actually was started the other line and
then walked and stopped where the brown
fence starts no my god now I'm really
really really nervous yeah yeah I was a
good I mean I yeah I think that's fine
accurate when you hit like oh she's
doing this I'm like right here yeah
calibrate I love golden buzz hey test
show us how you actually pose
yeah also natural cute for this picture
I thought I did a pretty good job it
wasn't the exact location that she took
it but New York's similar and I just had
so much fun taking this picture as you
guys could see because it was so funny
here's the final result
there you go I think for this picture I
give myself like again a 7 on 10 because
my face was like obviously super awkward
and like not the same at all but the
outfit wasn't also exact and the
lighting the editing was kind of weird
maybe I will do myself at 8:00 on 10 you
guys let me know in the comments down
below what you think I should rate
myself because I feel like no for the
last picture I decided to only do 4 and
this one I did back home in Montreal and
I tried to copy something that she did
in New York okay guys I'm back home in
Montreal right now oh my hair hi and we
are heading a two location that Tess
actually shot there once but I'm not
gonna do that picture I'm gonna do a
picture that she took in New York and
kind of make it my own in Montreal and
do something similar so I'm wearing
something somewhere right now and we're
gonna go shoot there I'll show you guys
how we do it but if this is probably my
last picture I think so we made it
downtown to a restaurant that has a
white brick wall in the background and
this is the picture that I'm going to be
if I can get it focused recreating as
you can see she is clearly not in
Montreal but it looks kind of similar
like the greens and the white and that
she has a latte I believe I'm getting
one as well I think mine actually comes
in like a mug but it's still gonna be
cute and I need to make sure of a middle
part my hair is not straight obviously
she's not wearing a gray sweater I have
underneath a black bodysuit that's kind
of similar to the vibe that she was
wearing I'm just raising all the time so
I have to sweat it over top
Plus this one is a little bit like
risque for such a cat a try to set you
guys up here
more
is their hand like this
so the final results look like this I
think it did a pretty dang good job with
this honestly I mean give myself a 9 on
10 for this picture the editing is a
little different I don't really know
exactly how she edits her pictures but I
think I did a pretty good job all in all
I think that Tessa's pictures are
amazing you should go follow her on
Instagram if you guys enjoyed this video
