Q&amp;amp;A video for you today because I don't
know I feel like it's been a while since
I've done one and I know a lot of you
guys ask me so many questions on
Instagram and Twitter so I don't know
sometimes I like to do these videos and
that way we can like discuss more in the
comments and stuff but anyways let's get
into the video
Ronaldo underscore and underscore goats
goats e says what would you do if you
were not a youtuber by the way I love
you I love you too and I think I
honestly don't know because I didn't
finish university because I started
doing YouTube and YouTube was my passion
and filming videos for you guys it's
just like a dream come true I was
originally in marketing beforehand and
then I wanted to dabble in psychology
and engineering I don't know I was like
lost in university so I to be quite
honest don't know what I would be doing
if I wasn't to doing this lost in black
asks what is your favorite ice cream
flavor and mine would have to be just a
vanilla because I don't like chocolate
ice cream it's really weird
I like soft-serve ice cream so not like
this scoopy one like I like the one that
swirls up Madeleine D and evn asks what
is your life goal and my life goal is to
be happy plain and simple I just want to
be happy I don't care what I'm doing as
long as I'm happy I think that's pretty
pretty legit like cool xx underscore
underscore Chaz I'm scoring square X X
asks what are your top three compliments
that you get I rip honestly I don't find
I mean I get compliments on my looks and
stuff but I really like compliments when
I have to do with my personality so if
someone says like you're so kind you're
so funny or you're so selfless like
things like that I find to be the best
kinds of compliments because I'd rather
be a really good person on the inside
because that's what counts the most
underscore Torre underscore 21 asks what
do you usually do on the weekend
I honestly either film videos for you
guys edit videos for you guys hang out
with my family or Daniels family
and workout like literally I don't go
out I don't drink I don't party I don't
I don't do anything guys I'm a grandma
Logan Willner asks what do you like to
do in your free time nothing because
when I have free time which is honestly
not that often which might seem weird
because I do YouTube full time but it's
actually quite hard to find free time
because I'm constantly working and
taking pictures and doing things which I
mean absolutely love but I'm doing free
time I like to just do nothing like
watch Netflix and do nothing
skyy and Stella asks would you ever dye
your hair another color if so what color
no I wouldn't
honestly like I love my ombre if
anything I would just go back to blonde
or leave it natural I wouldn't do any
other color I've always been a blonde
satu Grier I think that's how you say it
19 asks what is your go-to summer outfit
so for this summer I think my go-to
outfit if it's not like a bikini or
swimsuit because I'll be on the beach or
something my go-to outfit would
definitely be jean shorts of some kind
so like some kind of high-waisted denim
shorts or boyfriend denim shorts with a
cropped t-shirt and some like I don't
know kids or vans or something simple
like that with like a bunch of chokers
love that Cristina coof shout out to you
girl asks where I did done take you on
your first date so dad and I were
actually we've actually known each other
for a long time if you guys didn't know
already but on our first official date
we went for dinner and then we went to
with this look out on the mountain
where I live so you can see like the
whole city and stuff it was it was it
was cute man no man in underscore
underscore underscore asks do you want
to have kids in the future um definitely
I've always wanted to be a mom ever
since I was younger I've always just
pictured myself being a mom like that
would be my dream live underscore Audrey
asks do you have a bucket list and if so
what's on it oh my gosh do I have a
bucket list yes I have a bucket list so
many things I want to do in my life
Travel is definitely on there certain
places I really want to travel to I'm
just like certain things that I really
want to do I maybe I'll make a video
about it what you guys want to see
something like that because I could do
like examples of things I'd love to do
and I'd also love to know what your
bucket lists are because I feel like
that'd be cool because maybe it would
give me ideas to do more things let me
know the names
Melchior mochi asks if you can meet any
youtuber who would it be and why 100%
Zoe or zoella I love her but it's it's
weird because I wouldn't want to meet
her as like a fan I'd want to meet her
because I'd want to be her friend I just
feel like it's hard when you are
youtubers because it's hard to meet new
people and it's hard to like trust new
people because you don't know who's in
it to like get views or just get
something out of you you know what I
mean but I honestly believe that her and
I would be such good friends like I just
I I mean everyone not everyone is
exactly who they are on their videos I
know that I mean I feel like I keep it
pretty real I'm pretty sure she does as
well because she's super honest with her
viewers but I just feel like we're so
similar and we would get along really
well so definitely her but like not as a
fan as like a hey let's hang out in like
watch movies and eat dairy milk
chocolate like I love that Mary casts
true oh my god I'm so sorry if I
butchered your name that's really hard
to say but she asks do you think of
moving out yes I do and I'm actually
gonna be moving out not very soon but
sometime soon and I'm not gonna say
where or anything yet but leave some
comments down below where you think I'll
be moving and it's definitely somewhere
really exciting so I'm I'm really
excited about that and I think it would
be such a fun experience to like flog it
and I don't know let me know in the
comments below but yes definitely I'm
moving out
clovelly jizz asked what is your best
childhood memory my best childhood
memory would probably any memory that I
have up at my cottage up north or my
sister we just had such great times when
you're younger I have the best childhood
and Kyle and I actually want to film a
video it's like reacting to old home
videos because my dad literally like
vlog tower life
as children we have so many home videos
like it's insane so my sister and I had
started watching them a few like weeks
back and we were just laughing like
crazy because we were like the weirdest
kids ever and there are so many funny
things so if you guys would be
interested in seeing a video like that
let me know because I think it would be
funny Alexis brace underscore asks how
did you end up getting into making
YouTube videos by the way I love you so
much and you're beautiful I love you too
and you're beautiful as well um honestly
I've been watching YouTube videos since
like 2008 I've always wanted to do them
but I was very shy if you know me you
know I was a very shy person like I
would never be able to stand in front of
the class and give a speech I would like
shake and cry and it was really bad
so I kind of did it more as like a I'm
fed up with being shiny just step
outside my comfort zone and also I just
really wanted to do it I didn't care
what people said ever thought and I did
it and trust me everyone thought it was
weird Ashley Hammond asks if you could
visit anywhere you wanted in the whole
world where would you go I would love to
go back to Australia I loved it there so
much I only did all of Sydney a little
bit outside of Sydney but I would love
to visit all up the coast I love to go
inland I love to see like the outback I
love to see like so many places in
Australia I would love to go as well as
Europe I want to see more of Europe I've
been there once when I was nine then I
just went to Hungary because I'm a half
Hungarian we went to Budapest Hayley cab
16 asks what's your favorite store my
favorite store at the moment would
probably be three people or one piece
I just love everything that they have
right now Israel I can't like not pick
brandy I love brandy melville like as
much as people think like oh my god
brandy melville like so annoying so
overdone like I honestly love their
stuff they're super soft they're very
affordable super trendy and cute and I
like it it's basic but I love it
British sunflower asks at what age
should you start going into fashion and
photography um ever since I was a child
my dad always had a video camera on him
or a camera because he loved to film and
take pictures of us so I was always like
that annoying child that was like daddy
can I do it can I do it and he'd be like
Alex let me film you and I was like good
like crazy but yeah and then as I got
older I got my own camera and I would
always film videos of my friends and me

collages and stuff so ever since I was
