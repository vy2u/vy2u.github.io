another video on wednesday i asked you
guys on Instagram if you can ask her
some questions because I was going to be
doing a question and answer video today
since I have a lot of new subscribers
and followers on Instagram I figure that
this would be a pretty good way to get
to know me a little bit better even
though I have done one of these a couple
months ago but I mean people will want
to know the same kind of stuff plus more
so I just figured do another Q&amp;amp;A get to
know me a little bit better so I just
want to start off by saying I'm sorry
that it's very echoing here um I'm
actually house sitting for my aunt right
now so I'm living there at the moment
with my boyfriend and just wasn't using
her living room because there's a big
window and it's nice lighting also if
there's any strange noises I'm sorry I
can't really control the noises of the
house but I hope you guys can bear with
that for this video and let's just get
started okay so first question which is
the pretty obvious question is how did
you start modeling for brandy melville I
actually started working at the store
I'm from Montreal and they opened a
store a bit over a year ago and they
posted on the Instagram that they were
opening a store there and I really
really was a huge fan of the clothing
for a long time and I had been to the
one in New York multiple times plus I
used to order online a lot and I just
thought it would be a great idea to work
there so I applied and I got the job
just the sales associate and then
Katherine you guys now on Instagram is
cat Bell she worked there as well and we
were both asked to do the social media
so we were doing like a lot of pictures
and stuff and that's kind of how it
started they just came to us and asked
by I supplied to the store I don't think
in Canada there's like some model search
I don't think they do that i'm not
really sure anymore yeah that's that's
it is blonde your natural hair colors so
actually growing up I was very blonde as
a kid I had like white blonde hair in
the summer and then
the winter and get a bit darker but it
was more of a gold in and then um as I
got older it started getting darker it
was never brown but it was always kind
of a dirty blonde and then I actually
died my hair like completely blonde once
it was actually like the most disgusting
thing ever I don't know why I did it um
and then I would get like low lights and
highlights and I have like a bunch of
different color hair that had to do with
like blonde mostly like different shades
of blonde and um then around last year I
just started growing out my roots and I
was like maybe I'll try this hombre
thing I don't know maybe it'll suit me
and now it's been I guess in February
it'll be two years since I've done my
hair and um it's grown a lot so yeah
blondeness was my natural hair color now
this is my natural hair color which it
looks kind of like orange e because the
lighting but it's actually just like a
dark dark blonde / light brown how would
you describe your style um I would say
I'm very like tom boy I really really
don't like dressing in like fancy
dresses or skirts and heels and stuff I
mean I will on occasion but it's not my
favorite thing I love wearing like
boyfriend jeans or sweatpants or like
overalls and stuff like that I basically
dressed like a 12 year old boy and I
didn't okay with that do you have a
summer bucket list um I think like the
top thing on my summer bucket list was
basically youtube I really want to focus
on YouTube a lot which I'm very happy
it's doing so well for me right now I
know you guys are loving me posting
videos twice a week and I'm so grateful
for that because I love making videos
for you guys and I think maybe like I
kind of want to go whitewater rafting is
that sounds weird I don't know but I
really want to do that this summer
rock climbing maybe I'll do that I'm
basically a boy hair body or face which
one do you take care of most probably my
face to be honest because you guys
Carolee tell from the videos because
like letting completely washes
everything out but I do have like acne
prone skin and I do have some acne
scarring and stuff so I do spend extra
time trying to you know take care of my
skin and I do have a pretty good skin
care routine right now that if you guys
are interested let me know in the
comments and I'll do the skin care video
and it's actually working out for me
really well which I'm excited about
because I've been struggling with like
pimples and breakouts and then like dry
patches I have the weird skin so I
probably see my face if you could meet
one musician / band what would it be um
probably Arctic Monkeys just because I
just really really really am a big fan
of them right now but if it could be
like any band in the entire world even
if they're dead i would say probably the
beatles like back in the day when they
were huge I would have loved to meet the
Beatles I actually want to see the paul
mccartney concert a couple years ago
when they family and it was awesome he's
amazing he did three encores and he's
like an old guy and he was like coming
up and dancing on stage and singing it
was incredible I am just a huge fan of
The Beatles so probably them this is
this is a weird question would you
rather have toes as fingers or fingers
as toes yeah um fingers has toes I guess
cuz then I could like pick up stuff with
my toe that's gross okay next do you
want to with Barcelona yes yes yes I
would love to go to Barcelona if you
guys don't know I love traveling I've
been many places in the world my
favorite by far is probably Australia I
love Australia was my favorite place to
visit but I really want to go to Europe
I've only been one
and I was very young I was like nine
years old and I only when to Hungary
because somehow Hungarian so I don't
really remember but I would love to do a
euro trip what celebrity do you want to
me well for a long time I want to meet
Bradley Cooper because I was a huge fan
of him actually was an extra in a movie
once with him so I got to meet him and
we became like best friends I actually
was like debating just like grabbing him
like kissing him running away afterwards
because like we were told as extras that
we couldn't really talk to the
celebrities but like I didn't care I
when I spoke to him but I was like in my
head I was like if I just kiss him down
and run away then that'll be it I could
just say kiss Bradley Cooper and like
he'll never hear from me then none of
them will ever hear from me I'll just be
like bye are you ever going to come
visit la yes yes yes yes yes I have big
plans to come to California especially
LA I really want to go soon um if I
can't comment all like within the winter
/ spring then definitely next year at
VidCon I'm going to be there for sure
one hundred percent and maybe playlist
live to I don't really know but if you
guys would love to meet me at either of
those two events let me know what are
your favorite TV shows ok ok ok ok
pretty little liars Bates Motel um
Keeping Up with the Kardashians like a
new favorite but by far by far by far my
favorite TV show ever is Dance Moms I'm
a huge Dance Moms fun it's everyone
makes fun of me from watching that show
my boyfriend thinks the dumbest thing
ever but all I just think it's like the
most entertaining funny show ever plus
maddie is such a good dancer I love her
and then when I saw she was in the
chandelier music video it's just like I
wish I could dance like that ok she's
like white 11 and she's a bit of denser
than most people I know my age so what
inspired you to start YouTube ok so this
is actually kind of a long story maybe I
can make a separate video about it and
go more into detail but essentially I
was just dealing a long thing
and I was at home a lot and I was a huge
YouTube fan I watched so many videos and
I always wanted to do it but I was very
shy and honestly my really good friend
Laura would always tell me that I would
be really good at it and she would
always say you should start when you
should start when you'd be greatly great
and I mean none of my friends were
against it but no one really like you
know put it in my head and made me
believe that I actually could do it
other than Laura she really put a lot of
faith in to me and actually really was
so happy when I started my channel so
I'd give a lot of thanks to my friend
Laura because um I probably wouldn't
have started it wasn't for her how tall
are you i'm 58 how do we get your
attention on insta and twitter as you
know if you guys don't know i'm like
always on those apps and i'm always
replying so a lot of people say like oh
you don't side my tweet but like I
literally reply to like every tweet so
if I don't five years I'm sorry I really
didn't show up because I mean I don't
have that many followers on Twitter so
I'm always like talking to you guys and
in boxing you guys and i love it i love
getting to know you and love reading
through your tweets you guys are so
funny honestly sometimes i'm scrolling
through my field I'm just like you guys
are hilarious you just make my day will
you'll ever do meet ups yes one hundred
percent I will do meet ups um I mean as
of right now probably not because I
don't have a big enough falling I don't
think people would show up to my to my
view notes to be honest but I mean if
you guys wanted it than definitely at
what age did you get into fashion and
makeup I did not wear makeup from the
longest time I had no idea how to do
makeup probably I would say like 16 was
when the first time I put mascara on by
myself because I mean I was a dancer and
I did synchronize something so i did get
makeup put on for me for shows and stuff
but i never did it myself and i had no
idea that you could actually you know
put makeup on your face that wasn't for
