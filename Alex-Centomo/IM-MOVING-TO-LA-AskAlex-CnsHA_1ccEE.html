asked you guys on Twitter to ask me some
questions and I love doing Q&amp;amp;A is

bit better and it's just more fun that
way plus I always gain new subscribers

find out more about me I'm so sorry if I
butcher your names so Becca underscore
blagdon asks somewhere you really want
to visit soon so I have been to
Australia before but I would love to go
back and I actually do have something
kind of coming up I can't really talk
much about it yet and I hate when that
happens when like something's going on
and I'm not allowed to say anything and
I hate when youtubers do that but I
seriously can't talk about it but I
would I'm so excited and those of you in
Australia be excited simply Styles asks
what made you want to start your channel
yes i love you i love you too and
actually I always wanted to start a
YouTube channel I've been watching
youtube since like 2009 and I always
wanted to but I was way too shy one day
my friend just told me she's like you
need to do this like you'd be so good at
it and it was still before it was like
what it is now that I started it I just
wasn't that big yet but I did it because
I loved it not because it was like the
cool thing to do because trust me
everyone made fun of me for doing it at
first now they think it's the coolest
thing ever but at the time people were
like what are you doing basically I had
been watching youtubers and I wanted to
do that too because I loved ever since I
was younger I loved filming and editing
videos ice do it with my friends all the
time on movie maker back in the day
loved it Lenny's Queen asks who is your
favorite youtuber and I think at the
moment it's not the moment it's always
been Zola I love her she'll always be my
favorite youtuber whoa it's katelyn
underscore asks what states / countries
are you planning to visit soon while you
guys are watching this I'm actually in
LA which is so crazy because the last
time I was in California I was 50
so it's been a long time and I'm really
excited I think I mean I would love to
visit the Midwest I'd love to visit the
south there are so many places in the
state's I'd love to come so if you guys
let me know where you're from in the
comments down below and maybe we can
organize some kind of like meetup thing
in your state I don't know and as for
countries I really want to go to Greece
for sure and Spain my mom really wants
to go to those places so I'm planning on
maybe taking her there um obviously
Australia I love to visit like South
Africa South America I just want to
visit like so many places so I don't
know leave comments where you guys are
from and maybe we can like organize
something it would be so much fun
because I would love to like meet every
single one of you Sally and meraki roki
sorry asks what kind of videos would you
do when you're 60 years old um that's
like really really far in the future who
knows if you two will even exist then
but uh I don't know that's like
impossible to answer Lenny's queen or
Len is Queen I don't know her name is
Lena what is your favorite meal I think
my favorite meal oh gosh this is hard
but anything to do with french fries i'm
down i love french fries miss al-bunni
asks what's your favorite animal and
ever since I was a little girl I've
loved wolves and horses I've always been
obsessed with those two I don't know why
they're completely different but wolves
I've had a fascination with ever since I
was a kid and horses I've always wanted
a my own pet horse so those two
definitely my favorite I love dogs as
well but I mean I can have a pet dog
words I can't have a pet wolf I mean I
could have a pet horse if I lived on a
ranch or something I couldn't know and I
don't ride horses so Danny Alexandra 24
hey nice name asks where is the most fun
vacation place you have been to this is
hard because I have so many memories as
a kid
like so many vacations all of my family
like all my cousins and everything we
used to go down to Florida um I'm South
Carolina every single year as a kid and
those were so much fun because childhood
memories are amazing but I think as I
got older the funnest trip I've been on
so far has definitely been Australia I
like fell in love with that country and
I would move there in an instant over if
I could Sally muro key I feel like I
keep answering the same people but why
didn't you go to playlist live ok so I
really want to go to playlist live this
year like so bad but i just i couldn't i
was in Barbados I came home I had to do
all this work stuff and then I have to
plan for cali which is just like it was
just too much and I wouldn't been able
to go to playlist live and go to cali so
I had to kind of pick but I'm definitely
i'm gonna be at VidCon for you guys so I
am so excited about that if you guys are
going to VidCon let me know in the
comments down below because I'd love to
meet you guys it's gonna be an awesome
time Josephine Josephine Sen asks which
Disney princess are you most like as a
kid probably Ariel because um I was a
swimmer and I thought I was a mermaid so
probably her but uh I don't think I was
like any princess I think it was more
like a prince I think I was like Simba
because I was such a tomboy I'm still
such a tomboy I don't know hi Oh Elsa
yeah I'm more like Elsa Alina underscore
05 10 asks would you ever dye your hair
any crazy color probably not to be
honest um I don't know I think it looks
awesome on some people but I'm just not
that kind of person and I probably would
get sick of it after like two days so no
bumble Beatrice if there was a movie
made about your life who would you want
to play as you um everyone says okay
I get in like everyday life as well as
my videos you look like Taylor Swift you
look like karlie kloss has anyone ever
told you that yes so many times like all
the time i get those comments on their
both of actresses but like I feel like
that would be like the most legit role
and also i feel like i'm kind of similar
to Taylor Swift is I'm very like
artistic and nerdy if that makes any
sense but I think actress wise I don't
want to be cliche and say Jennifer
Lawrence but I do love her probably
Jennifer Lawrence to be honest because I
do love her and she's awesome Korean
Murdock says what what age did you start
getting into fashion and makeup also how
did you learn to stay positive in high
school um I was not positive in my
school I was such like a scaredy cat and
I used to get bullied all the time and I
would come home crying high school is
not a good time for me so I think
because I was involved in sports and I
was a competitive swimmer and I had so
many friends outside of school it wasn't
hard like my life wasn't hard because I
have so much fun like I would go to
school to go to school to learn and to
do well and then as I went home I had
all my other friends and I was in a
sport program in high school so I've
leave school early to go practice
because I was a competitive swimmer so I
had it like it wasn't high school itself
was not a good time but i didn't spend
majority of my time in high school if
that makes any sense like I didn't have
a normal high school experience but um
and then what age dice are getting into
fashion and makeup I've always been
interested in fashion I just had always
my own sense of fashion which might not
have been cool to some people but I
always knew what I liked and I wore what
I liked and it's kind of transitioned
into my adulthood because now I still
just wear what I like and if it's not
trendy whatever I like it I'm makeup
probably when I was 18 breezy breathe I
think that's how you say breezy Bree
asks what's your favorite thing to do
outside of shopping and YouTube you make
it seem like that's my life I just
shopping i do youtube all kind of I
think exercising I love working out i
love the active i love finding new
things to do this summer i definitely
want to go like rock climbing and stuff
I know I just love doing anything
outdoorsy I love being outside so yeah
definitely not Sarah Gardner asks would
you ever come all the way to
saskatchewan canada i love you i love
you too and actually yeah because two of
my really good friends live in saskatoon
they recently moved there so Daniel and
I we're definitely thinking of visiting
and yeah it's in Saskatchewan I never
thought in my life I would ever visit
there but it's gonna happen clear but
murky asks can you tell us yours and
dance story of how you guys got together
I actually made a video with Daniel it
was a boyfriend tag I guess we kind of
explained her story but i'll give you
like a very fast story basically Dinah
line grew up together we've known each
other since we were eight years old
because we both swam together we didn't
like each other growing up we actually
hated each other and then later on in
life when we kind of reconnected um we
got along so well and we have so much in
common and it was just like instantly
connected and we were both in places
that we did not want to have a
relationship because we both weren't
like ready but it would like it was so
perfect that it just happened and we're
both so happy and it's so weird to think
that like we hated each other and we
look back at like old videos and
pictures that were both in we're like
haha like so funny the memories but I
think it's cool to UM be dating your
best friend and he is my best friend
frenzy I think that's how you say it
frenzy asks who is your celebrity girl
crush probably Jennifer Lawrence to be
honest miss al-bunni asks would you
rather travel your whole life or stay in
one town for all of your life yes i love
you i love you too definitely travel
because um i do would not like to see in
the same place my whole life it's weird
because i always pictured myself I'm
Canadian and i'm from montreal and I've
always pictured my life living in my
tree all because that's just what I kind
of grew up with and the system that I'm
used to but as I get bigger and bigger
on youtube I kind of realized that I
probably will eventually end up in
California which is so weird for me
because I never thought in my life I
would ever live there but I used to I
mean when I went there I loved it
and there's just so much opportunity out
there and I mean I always pictured
myself in a beach I hate living in the
snow but the snow is nice doing the
holidays that's why it's perfect because
if I lived in California and then it can
come home to visit for the holidays and
see all the snow and do all the festive
things and then go back to the beach
that'd be awesome so um not anytime soon
but probably in the future I would be
living there I recognize your screen
name but I find it so hard to say belen
see our HT asks can we fangirl about
selfie together please yeah I loves
Elfie just saying it's so weird because
do you feel this way guys like when
you're watching youtubers you feel like
you're like best friends with them
because I've been watching Zoey for so
long and we're so similar and we're like
the same age so I feel like would be
like best friends for real and she has
no idea who I am so it's just crazy
because like if ever I were to meet her
I'd come across as like some crazy
fangirl but in reality i really feel
like we'd be really good friends just
because we're so similar and obviously
it's hard to say because youtubers don't
put hundred percent of their life online
but what she does put is very similar to
how i am and i just feel like would be
really close so that is all the
questions that i'm going to be answering
for today if you have any other
questions feel free to leave them in the
comments below as you all know I go
through my comments section all the time
and I answer you guys so it's crazy to
think that right now as you're watching
this I'm in California so I won't be
able to answer them right away but I get
home tomorrow I also didn't say I'm in
California for a shoot for Windsor store
because we're doing our Coachella shoot
so that's going to be really fun to show
you guys and if you're interested in
seeing what I'm up to while I'm there
