today and I decided to film a questions
and answers video because I get a lot of
questions on my Instagram pictures so I
figured instead of just answering the
same question over and over again I
would just answer them all right here
and that way I can just link this video
again if someone asks the same question
is here to help me out because because
I'm just that cool and I know I'm
awkward yeah you guys are insane you
sent me so many questions I was not
expecting like a hundred of them whoa in
like an hour I was just blown away okay
let's let's start how tall are you I'm
five eight and I'm five three how did
you get into brandy melville I walked
how was your childhood growing up for me
it was a lot of fun I had a really great
family um I played a lot of sports and I
was super active it was a big tomboy and
then she came along and it ruined my
life so yeah sorry yeah and I'm still in
my childhood your teenager you're not a
child 2ph Africa tries to have a child
you call everyone a child though you
call like old men choice child would you
rather be an elephant-sized bunny or a
bunny sized elephant this is a weird
question it's like shout out to Sarah
for that question
was that your friend yeah I mean that's
a great question good job sad would you
rather be an elephant-sized bunny or a
bunny sized elephant open size bunny so
I could I'd you I think they're so cute
what camera do you take your pictures
with so the video right now I'm filming
on my Canon t5i I have a couple
different lenses that I use but this is
just my Canon t5i and then I use that
for most of my Instagram pictures but
sometimes when I'm taking selfies or
even just like oh no random pictures
answer the wall sometimes I'll just use
my iPhone like I'm not even kidding you
oh use my iPhone and the way I did my
pictures I made a video all about that
so I
link that down below or you can just
click right here if you're interested in
seeing that video I don't wanna get into
detail with that because I went into
detail in that video a lot okay what do
you use to keep your hair still healthy
um I also made a video of how I curl my
hair and and that video what kind of
explained what I do to keep my hair
healthy basically I don't use here on it
that often I mean I know that looks bad
now because my hair's curled but I
promise you I really rarely use heat um
I get my hair trimmed like twice a year
and I don't wash my hair every day I
wash my hair every day like 4 or 5 days
I'll shower every day
I just don't wash it every day because
it's not good for you yeah I know but
the longer you go without showering it
was just a brain and six school so yeah
a dry shampoo dude get on that get on
that ok what's your pet peeve when
people swerve they drink it like
probably what I was telling her before
is when people haven't spoken to in a
long time like from high school or from
elementary school oh my gosh Alex how
are you it's been so long can i have a
shout out shout out shout out yeah no no
she waves those to me no good no but
seriously like but I've spoken to you in
a long time and then you also need you
shout outs no no who are some of your
favorite band slash artists right now
I'm really loving the 1975 and the 1975
oh man I just downloaded their whole
album and ya know they're so good me
being happier and we just listened to
the we listened to chocolate on repeat
chocolate is some good shadows new cat
Belle cath Belle that's cat Belle but no
seriously like we listened to chocolate
so many times and I really been liking
the weekend
see that the snow that came off your
roof was pink her it's just my eye
reflection that's messed up right now
how did you get a job at brandy Melville
I applied and I sent my CV if you have
to bring three people to live on an
island with you forever who would you
choose
my boyfriend would be number one I
probably my Cheetos know what I bring
him like I probably bring like Cat
Catherine my boyfriend and my grandma I
feel like I bring CEREC she's a mind to
build things on a random island early on
a scale of one to ten how good are you
guys at dancing I actually danced for a
long time growing up so I'm pretty good
dancer here what about you Sophie are
you a good dancer I'm like a 0.2 so you
kind of have like some yeah yeah what
hair curler do you use your hair always
looks amazing I made a video on this I
curl my hair with a straightener so I
will link that down below on how I do
that look Shannon in mine yeah very hard
today guys okay another question I get
is not question but people after that
video was supposed to keep telling me
that it didn't work on them don't worry
keep trying I swear when I did it the
first time it looked like crap it was so
bad and I just keep like practicing and
practicing even she said she couldn't do
it but like keep practicing you'll get
it just twist and pull whatever do it
again how did you become a brandy model
okay well I actually worked at the store
first and then cat calf Belle and I were
asked to do the social media because we
had like YouTube channels and stuff that
we were into that kind of stuff so then
they asked us to be in charge of the
social media part of that so then we
just started taking pictures for the
Instagram and how it started amazing
story Alex well I mean
there's no like there's no like model
application they just kind of the only
person who really models for the company
without working at the company is Karina
and her channels Karina underscore
underscore B right here you can go
follow her she's like literally just a
brand new model okay wait
you know Kaitlyn IRISA does she work at
the store no no let's do I say that's
different
I need beauty tips tonight I don't look
pretty um be yourself
no really embrace who you are don't try
and copy someone else don't try and be
somebody else I think the most beautiful
thing is someone who's confident with
their own in their own skin
for real what does style mean to you and
do you ever feel not confident with
yourself sometimes and what tips would
you give to someone who's always very
insecure okay so the first one
what does style mean to you I think it's
a form of expression I think it's
something that you can show your kind of
your personality in a different way do
you ever feel not confident with
yourself sometimes definitely yeah
there are many times where I'm not
confident with myself it doesn't have to
be with my parents me with anything that
I'm doing and I think the best way to
get over that is just to be happy
honestly happiness is a choice you
control your own feelings you control
your own control your own happiness if
you're gonna sit there and be mopey and
be sad and be self-conscious about
yourself you're gonna feel crappy and
bad things are probably gonna happen to
you because you're just always negative
and you're always sad and upset but if
you are able to just kind of embrace who
you are and stop comparing yourself to
everyone else be happy in your own skin
and just be happy with what's around you
it really works it's the most important
issue because if you're gonna sit down
and like look at other girls and be like
why can't be like this person why can't
be like that person you're never gonna
be happy because you're never going to
be 100% comfortable with yourself and at
the end of the day you look at yourself
in the mirror and you sleep in your own
bed and you go to bed with yourself so
if you're not 100% happy with yourself
then you will never be able to
and I think that's very important
definitely I have times where well it's
again gonna do everybody has their days
where they don't feel confident but I
always compare myself to other people
and I'm sure you girls are probably like
what like how can you compare yourself
to anyone but I do what everyone does
there's always people that are gonna be
like wow she's prettier than me well
this person's better looking to me she's
better at this than me you can't think
that way and that's something that I had
to learn growing up I'm dealing with a
lot of like bullying and stuff like that
it's just can't that let that stuff get
to you just gonna shrug it off and be
happy in your own skin
and then I said yeah those are the tips
those are the tips oh yeah answered your
question what inspired you to start
video blogging so I'm guessing you mean
like YouTube videos well I watched I've
been watching YouTube for five years now
you guys long I started watching YouTube
like back in the day before there was
like the big thing because I started
watching the Shaytards and I don't know
if you guys know who they are they're
just a family that does like a vlog
every single day of their life and those
were the first people I started watching
on YouTube like almost five years ago
and I just really fell in love with
their family and it was really cool then
I started figuring out there's this
whole community behind it and then I
started watching Beauty videos and I
watched him a fish Michelle Phan who's
the first person I watched I was like oh
well makeup I didn't even know how to do
makeup I never tried in my life and
don't even think I owned a mascara like
Sagara mascara whatever um and then I
started trying out all these tutorials
and these girls were doing and every
time I went out or went to a party or
went to my friend's house they would
always ask me how did you do that oh how
did you make up punch in your head I
said yeah I said YouTube and they're
just like what so now I would end up
doing my friends makeup in here all the
time and I said well why don't I just
make a video and do the same thing
because I feel like I can do the same
thing as these girls and then that way
if I make a video I could show my
friends and they can do it themselves
and with tutorial yeah actually I
started watching from from you actually
you said I watching you too because me
and then I watched like the Janoskians
yeah beside you - yeah who's your
celebrity crush Leonardo DiCaprio do you
like Justin Bieber yes I love him no I
mean there's no one that I hate but I
just don't think he sets a very good
example for younger people stop marina
okay really
do you think he's doing right now I was
just like you think that's cool he's so
cool right do it I'm gonna go to buy
drunk good I'll get away oh goody
obviously it's stupid like I don't
support that idea of what he did but in
the big picture I still love Justin
Bieber like his music yeah as a person
I'm gonna get so much hate for this just
they'll love me and they won't love you
so it's okay I don't hate him I just
don't think he sends a very good example
what's your favorite eye product for a
winter slash spring mascara for all day
every day
I love mascara but I think for a winter
and spring I use a lot of like topi
purples in like the outer corner and I
think that's really nice so do you wear
any final wear anything on my eyes like
a mascara that's it good I'm not like a
big makeup person in actually do you
have any inspiration when you take
pictures besides tumblr by the way I
love you I love you too um besides
tumblr I mean brandy melville has a
certain kind of look towards their
pictures that we always try to recreate
but then the tumblr pictures are more
artsy and that's basically like most of
my inspiration comes from tumblr or
sometimes I'll just like I'll see you
picture on tumblr and then I'll be like
oh I can kind of do that but then I end
up doing something completely different
that like isn't like anything I saw on
tumblr and I kind of like
like you can tell it like you're
inspired by the picture though can you
ever do a meet-up I mean I don't think
I'm like famous enough to do I don't
think I'm famous when girls come to
approach me join your on I love it I
love when you girls come say hi and ask
for a picture it means a lot to me and
just it's so unexpected because I don't
I'm not famous guys like you guys are
funny but like so doing a meet-up I mean
I guess if you wanted like cat Belle and
I to do a meet-up that would be pretty
cool but I don't know when or how we can
do that if you have any suggestions you
can leave that in the comments below
what do you do first thing when you come
home from a long day of working I flop
on my bed and pass out
my galerias well if I'm not hungry I'll
just like lie in my bed and watch like
YouTube videos probably is my favorite
thing to do
favorite song at the moment let it go
from the frozen soundtrack I'm not even
kidding I love that song my favorite
song one time
oh god the funny soul and my favorite
Justin Bieber song is probably a fall
anyways but that has nothing to do with
right now so my favorite song at the
moment is probably chocolate by the
1970s get you is what's your favorite
Starbucks drink I really like the
passion tea lemonade that you get in the
summertime but I like it sweetened with
raspberry I like the vanilla Frappuccino
like the one that you left in the fridge
already like you don't get them to make
it I've no idea
okay well it's good I don't really drink
coffee if that's what you're wondering
um where do you shop I shove it Brandi
and urban mmm
mostly and talk shop would you rather
wear crop shirts or a sweater shirt oh
people it depends on the season so in
the summer I rather wear crop tops and a
little winter I rather wear like knit
sweaters mm-hmm favorite books I really
like the divergent series and
I think I just I'm saying that because I
just read them they're really good
the trilogy it's really amazing I would
recommend it to anybody I love the Harry
Potter series growing up I don't read a
lot but I wanted to start a book The
Outsiders well that was good oh my god
you look like tier ships and Vanessa
Hudgens thanks I think you're referring
to my sister yeah not to me I don't look
big uh yeah she actually likes that as a
compliment because she thinks Vanessa
Hudgens is a beautiful girl she's happy
no Kyla do you have any pets I have two
dogs I have a brother
what was your most embarrassing moment
my life my life my life embarrassing
that's my embarrassing moment yeah who's
your favorite cousin which hero girls
from Urban Outfitters in the summer best
advice you've ever gotten
um it's not personally but it's from
shaycarl and he always says that
happiness is a choice which I said
before and then heÃµs also says that
today is the first day of the rest of
your life and I really believe that
because you shouldn't live in the past
you shouldn't have regrets you shouldn't
worry about the future today could be
the first day of the rest of your life
so just live in the moment be happy oh
god I know my diet always that he always
says that like you're you know I don't
know you don't have talent it's just if
you put in the effort you get what you
want
so these dancers not talented no my gut
says you're not born with the talent you
lose except for me yeah I give all the
time every day of my life I'm a kid so
basically what we're getting out of this
is that I'm amazing so if you have no
talent so she is telling no I'm just
kidding I'm King guys seriously though
I'm not actually this rude how many ugly
selfies do you guys take on other
people's phones I probably take like six
million a day on my friends phones like
my friends like Sophia no I again how do
you decide on your outfit of the day I
wake up I take clothes out of my closet
and I put them on I open my doors and
then I take the clothes out where did
you get the Paul McCartney t-shirt
please actually you got that at his
concert and then I just cut it up to
make it look really cool so that's all I
don't know where you can buy that
because when he came to my city to
perform I went to his concert about
shirt that's it for the question I'm
sorry I couldn't answer all of them
there honestly there were so many
questions and them are very similar
though yeah but at the same time I don't
want to be this video like half an hour
long but yeah I don't think you want to
