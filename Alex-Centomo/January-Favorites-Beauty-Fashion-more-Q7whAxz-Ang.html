changing up a lot in the month of
January I figured I would just sit down
and film another monthly favorites for
you guys because I know you guys really
like this I guess I'm gonna strap with
random favourites first just because get
those out the way because they're kinda
random basically in the month of January
I have kind of done a big lifestyle
change i know a lot of people their new
year's resolutions are to like be
healthier and stuff and that's kind of
always my philosophies just to live a
healthier lifestyle just because i have
so many like food allergies and I deal
with anxiety and stuff so I just I'm
very careful what I put in my body
recently I've been she's been a huge and
to like working out and staying fit and
just feeling good all around I never
deprive myself of anything but I have
been like really enjoying living a
healthier lifestyle and I just feel so
much better I'm sleeping better and I
just feel more energized and it's great
and i love it and you're probably never
going to go back but basically the main
thing I've been doing differently in
January is I did 80 talks cleanse which
I have tried before and I never really
thought that it would like work or help
because I've been a huge advocate into
changing my lifestyle completely I did
want to try out at cleanse and I tried
out this one it's the fit t 14-day detox
or detox cleanse it's a blend of all
natural ingredients when this was sent
to me I checked it out I always do this
because I'm like a skeptical person and
I freaked out everything but I brought
it to my doctor and I was like is this
okay can I do this
and she looked through it and it's all
natural basically I will wake up in the
morning and I have my breakfast which
normally consists of either oatmeal or
yogurt or toast or something like that
usually what happened the morning and
then I will have a huge glass of water
and a cup of tea and what I do is I put
one of these bags so here I'll show you
what it looks like inside comes with one
of these little tiny bags and smells so
good and I put it I steep it for around
three to five minutes and then I will
drink that right before I workout so
obviously I want things to digest and
stuff so while I'm like I'll like watch
an episode of gilmore girls or something
as I'm drinking my tea and then when it
all settles I will go for my work out if
you're interested in seeing what my
workout is at the moment I will list
that video down in the description it's
just my winter workout routine and I do
that quite often I do I work out five
maybe six times a week just because I'm
a very hyperactive person like I am so
hyper all the time and I'm very active
and if I don't like because I work from
home if I don't like do something I go
crazy like I just need to work out or
like I danced my room or something like
I don't know I just need to move my body
I've always been like that ever since I
was a kid i'm just a very active person
and i have noticed such a big difference
using this tea this is different than
any other tea i have tried before any
other detox thing I've tried for one it
did not give me an upset stomach which
is huge because every time I've tried
them it made me feel so like nauseous
and yucky and I just did not like that
so this really did not make me nauseous
which I liked a lot because I hate being
nauseous if you guys know my fear of
vomiting so that was a plus um and then
also I just found that I felt more
energized during my workout so when I
like to run that's like my main form of
cardio I love running and I just felt so
like energized and awake and I can
actually look run longer it just feels
so much more energized for the rest of
day
a-and I can get so much more done
another thing that's good with this is
that might not be for everyone's taste
whatever but it does suppress appetite a
little bit so you don't feel as hungry
during the day which I know I have a lot
of friends that you like overeat and
stuff and you just you know when you're
just feeling bored and you just feel
like doing something so you just like go
to the fridge you eat it does suppress
that so I do catch yourself not feeling
as hungry it removes a lot of toxins
from your body which hinder your body
from burning fat it's not that I'm not
trying to lose weight like that's not my
intention at all like there might be
someone else's attention for me oh it's
more just like I love being healthy and
stuff and I just wanted to kind of
sculpt my body I wanted to be more like
muscular like I love that look up like
muscle and the one thing I do like about
this is that it does give you energy
without like the jitters you know like
you don't feel that like caffeine like
shaky feeling you just feel energized
and weight and I just like it a lot I
think this one's only like twenty-five
dollars one thing i have to stress do
not just think that drinking this tea is
going to make you lose weight it's not
you need to have a balanced diet you
need to be exercising on a regular day
basis you know it's not just like an
instant thing like that it's going to
make you lose weight it doesn't work
that way you know like you can't just
eat like a bunch of McDonald's and pizza
and then have this team be like okay I'm
sad I'm gonna lose weight like it's not
gonna it's not going to work you need to
be healthy about it yes to this
definitely next round and favorite would
have to be my luxy hair extensions these
are just sick and beautiful I've done a
video all about these hair extensions
if you're interested saying that i will
link it down below but I've been wearing
these a ton in the month of January for
pictures and stuff and I could not be
happier so I guess and now on to some
beauty products i only have two because
there are only two things i've been
absolutely loving them up in january the
first has to be the Anastasia dip brow
gel eye brow liner thingy I use this for
my eyebrows and it's amazing perfect
color for my eyebrows and I'm I've never
been able to do my eyebrows before and
after using this it's just so simple to
do my eyebrows I'm probably never going
to switch this I always say that but for
real like this is amazing and I use it
every single day when I'm wearing makeup
and the next thing I actually just got
this and I used to never own those my
sister owned it and she's had it for
literally like five years and it's
barely even like hasn't even hit pad or
anything that's how long it lasts but
it's the mac mineralize skinfinish and
soft and gentle and it just looks like
this it's the simple like most popular
one I use it as a highlight on my face I
don't know if you guys can tell but I
love having my face be super doing
everything and especially now with my 10
which I don't know if you guys can see
but from Barbados I just been loving to
use this because it just looks so great
now on to fashion I have a few fashion
favorites the first has to be this Oh
big like pleather oversized travel bag
and this is what it looks like it's
really big basically I have been
traveling so much in the month of
January like well kind of January like I
went to New York at the end of December
then I went away to a cottage and then
just doing things where I have to bring
a lot of clothing and stuff like this
has been a lifesaver and especially with
Barbados and everything like it has
literally been a lifesaver it's so big
inside you can fit so much stuff
even if you wanted it bigger you can
actually unsnap these sections here to
make this longer and bigger and I just
think this is like the perfect duffel
bag it's super nice it looks pretty
classy it's actually not this shiny just
looking super shiny on camera because
the lighting but um it's it's just like
Club era thing and it's by the brand
gold culture riot and i love it i will
link the link to everything down below
free lies you're interesting checking
out they also have amazing purses I got
a few stuff so i think im gonna show
that in a hall I don't want to show you
everything I got from them because I
would like it but that's just been a
favorite of mine in the month of january
then the next would have to be of course
turtleneck sweaters but in particular
this one for some reason i have worn
this so many times it's a long sleeve
sort of cropped sweater or long sleeve
shirt it's a thicker material but it's
not like a sweater material it's like a
thick t-shirt stretchy material and it's
not it's like the half turtleneck there
you know that like look with the half
trail neck i know i just really like
this it's super flattering for some
reason like stripes right now are like
huge I love wearing this with anything
like black drip jeans regular
high-waisted jeans love it that being
said I've worn these jeans so many times
but these are from daily look they look
like this they're high-waisted I call
them my high waisted mom jeans because
they're baggy but they're high-waisted
and they're just like the boyfriend
jeans where they're baggy and I have
been rolled up but they're high-waisted
so they're super nice they're perfect to
wear with like shirts like this where
it's like cropped and I just think this
looks so good together I love wearing
this outfit I think I've worn it like
probably eight times in the month of
January and I'm sure everyone's getting
pretty sick of it but I don't care
because I love it and then the last
thing I have is also from daily look and
I've been wearing
so many times it's this jacket it looks
like this it's like this black kind of
textured almost shiny jacket its pretty
long it covers my butt and it has this
faux fur that goes around like this so
it looks like this when you wear it and
I get so many compliments when I'm
wearing this it's by the brand make pink
but I got it on daily look I absolutely
love daily luke and I just been wearing
this jacket so much um I really like it
and I worked the airport and got a lot
of questions from people about my
jackets so that has been a huge favorite
of mine because I've been traveling so
much it's so hard for me to find
favorites and stuff just because like I
haven't really been testing out many
things one of the main things like I
said before was just like lifestyle
change so if you have any questions
