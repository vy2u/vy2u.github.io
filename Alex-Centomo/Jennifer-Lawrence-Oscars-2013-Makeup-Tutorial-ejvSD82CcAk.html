this look today it is a Jennifer
Lawrence inspired makeup tutorial from
the Academy Awards 2013 Academy Awards
which actually happened last night and I
thought Jennifer looked absolutely
stunning I am a huge Jennifer Lawrence
fan I have loved her ever since I saw
her in winters bomb which was like years
back and I just think she's like such a
humble and funny and charismatic
individual like she's just hilarious
I love watching her in interviews and
stuff like that because she's not like
that normal actress that you know once
they start getting recognized and
getting in more movies and stuff like
that and become like I don't know how to
explain it but it's almost like it's
like rehearsed and people have to you
know tell them what to say and do where
she's just like total like hillbilly and
well not really like that but she grew
up like on a farm and she has a bunch of
older brothers that like beat her up and
stuff like that and she's just so funny
and she actually won the award for Best
Actress last night and she is only 22
years old and she beat a bunch of other
actresses that you know have been doing
this for a long time so I was just so
excited and not only did she win but she
fell on the stairs on her way to get the
award which was like very typical of her
but so funny and cute and she just gave
such a nice speech and then I saw an
interview of her later on and I just
thought it was hilarious so I really
recommend you going to check out her
work because she is just amazing and um
I love her and I think she's beautiful
obviously and so I was really excited
when I saw her on the red carpet cuz I
was just like oh my god I love her looks
so much it was just very neutral but
glowy and a really nice smoky eye not
like too extreme though who's very like
topi she had a real I think she was in
Dior actually and it was just a really
nice strapless dress that's why I kind
of wore this I don't know if you could
see it in the video but um a really nice
strapless Dior dress and she had like a
long diamond necklace that went behind
her back with that and just some plain
diamond earrings and her hair was pulled
back into kind of like a
twisted not bun thing in the back of her
head and I just think she's wonderful
and amazing so yeah if you guys are
interested in seeing how I recreated her
look then just keep on watching so I'm
gonna start off with my NARS eyeshadow
primer and I'm just applying this all
over my eyes I'm then gonna rub it in so
that way when I apply my eyeshadow they
stay on all night or all day and they
keep the colors looking really nice then
taking my Maybelline Color tattoo in
toughest hope I'm gonna be applying this
to my eye as a base before I start doing
a smoky look just because Jennifer she
had a smoky eye but it was more on the
taupe grayish side so I thought this
would be a perfect color to put on my
eyes before I start applying the eye
shadows then using my Mac eyeshadow in
patina I'm gonna be applying this to the
lid just to warm up the look a little
bit because Jennifer's look wasn't so
dramatic it was actually more neutral on
the eyelid and then had a darker gray
look on the outer corner and then smoked
into her eyelash actually not her
eyelash sorry smoked into her crease and
I'm gonna be using this color by Mac
called print' I thought it would be
perfect because it is a grayish black
but it has a blue undertone and I am
just focusing this on the outer corner
of my eye and bringing it up into my
crease to create that nice smoky look
that Jennifer had and then I'm bringing
the color underneath my eyes as well but
what I want to let you guys know is that
Jennifer does have deep set eyes like I
do so I brought the color really high up
on the brow bone just so that when I
close my eyes you can actually see the
color whereas normally if I close my
eyes you couldn't really see any color
at all because I don't really have any
eyelids so then taking just any nude
look I'm bringing this underneath my
brow to highlight it
then taking any shimmery look I'm using
this color by Mac I forget what it's
called but I'll link it down below I'm
just applying this to my inner quarter
onto my eyelid to brighten up the look a
little bit more and then I'm gonna be
taking my Maybelline master precise
liquid eyeliner and I'm gonna be
applying this to my upper sorry upper
lash line before I apply my false lashes
just so I know where to apply them
properly because I suck at applying
false eyelashes yes I'm going cross-eyed
it just so you guys know I always go
Crosse away when I do my makeup then
curling my lashes and applying my
mascara I'm just using my makeup forever
smoky lash mascara you can use whatever
mascara you want I'm applying one coat
to each eye then taking my are dow self
adhesive lashes I like to bend them like
this to give them some shape and then I
apply them onto my lash line
I don't really use glue by the way sorry
I didn't realize I was out of the frame
for this it's really really hard to
apply false lashes in front of a camera
and not in front of a mirror but yeah I
just place them on to the middle of my
eyelid and then I push them into the
corners and yeah they're all nice and
then I apply some mascara to my bottom
lashes just to open up the eyes a little
bit more then taking my NARS Laguna
bronzer I'm going to be contouring my
cheekbones just cuz Jennifer Lawrence's
look really had a nice contour to it and
I just love contouring anyways cuz yeah
it's just a lot of fun then taking this
blush by Maybelline in light pink I am
applying this to the apples on my cheeks
and bringing them up towards my temples
this color matched perfectly with the
look that Jennifer was wearing it's just
really subtle and glowy then taking my
benefit high beam liquid highlighter I'm
gonna be applying this to the top of my
cheekbones and bringing it up and then
I'm gonna be applying it to my brow bone
the bridge of my nose a little bit on my
forehead and my Cupid's bow to make my
lips look a little bit fuller because
Jennifer does have kind of plump lips
they're really
then taking this nude pink shimmery
lipstick I'm going to be applying this
it is by Maybelline called born with it
and I thought it matched perfectly to
the lip color that Jennifer was wearing
okay guys so this is the finished look I
just pulled my hair back as we saw
before I teased it and just put it in a
low twisted bun it's not really what she
did with her hair on the red carpet but
it's close enough I just really like it
and then I put some diamond hair hanging
earrings in and a necklace kind of in
the same way that she wore it just
around her back and a strapless white
shirt I don't know if you guys can see
that from there and yeah
so I love Jennifer and I love this look
I just thought it was so beautiful and I
kind of wish that I was doing something
right now because now I'm all done up
and I want to go out and it is 2:00 in
the afternoon so yeah there's nowhere
for me to go but yeah I hope you guys
