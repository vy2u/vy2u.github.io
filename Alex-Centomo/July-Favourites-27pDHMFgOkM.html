channel so I have not done a monthly
favourites video in the longest time and
I really missed doing these because for
one I when I watch other people's I
always find new products to like test
out and see if I like plus I like to see
what people wear throughout the month
and like what they love because for
example where I'm from in the summer if
I see somebody I like on YouTube wear my
shirt a lot throughout the month of July
then maybe I will try out that ship for
August I'm just gonna get right into it
I will start off with beauty products so
I I know I'm saying this now but I like
never wear makeup like ever in the
summer unless I'm filming like an intro
to a video or something like that or I
have like a special event or whatever
but if I am wearing anything it is this
Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer which
is actually what I'm wearing on my face
right now and then I just put on like
eyebrows mascara and lipstick that's it
this stuff is incredible it's amazing
and this bottle has lasted me three
months and it's this tiny little bottle
and I use a lot of products I have a
cold this can be found in like the
checkout section of Sephora that you
know they have always those like little
boxes of travel stuff that's where I
found this amazing next when it comes to
skincare I have been using two different
products the past few months and I'm
obsessed with them so much the first one
is this face cream and this base cream
is by Charlotte Tilbury I've been using
it day and night and it's lasted me so
long and every time I travel I just put
some of this in the travel size one as
for skin I've been using this and this
was actually given to me when I took my
flight from Doha to Bali and we were on
Qatar Airlines and we were given like a
little travel thing when you get on the
plane and inside there was like lip balm
there was like the eye stuff there was
ear plug socks and then this and I was
like oh that's a big cream to give on a
plane and I smelt it oh my god guys this
is amazing so this is by Giorgio Armani
and it is the perfumed body lotion it
smells incredible it's so good I don't
know how to describe the scent so I'm
not even gonna like try but it just like
every time I wear it people were like
what do you wear oh my gosh it smells so
good and I will have everything like
down below so maybe there's like a
description on it that explains how it
smells but it's like really sweet and
pretty and I really like it a lot so
okay as for hair I as you guys know wash
my hair like once every five days in the
summer it tends to get a lot more greasy
because it's hot and I'm sweating and
obviously I work out every single day
but I don't wash my hair every day so
this stuff comes in crazy handy so this
is the e salon without a trace dry
shampoo and it like there is no trace of
it it's and there's no white no residue
it doesn't feel crunchy or crispy I
didn't really put much in it this
morning because I'm literally in such a
rush to go to the water slides which I'm
so excited for but this stuff is really
really good the only downside to this is
that it's too big to bring on an
airplane and I always do like carry-on
stuff that's goin downside but that's
not really downside because for those of
you that don't travel like this is the
best thing of life so I'm never going to
go back to using another thing unless I
run out of this and need something in
between before this comes in the mail
okay
no on to fashion items because let's be
real that is I don't know about you guys
that's my favorite my favorite my
favorite thing to watch when it comes to
monthly favorites so I'm gonna start off
with accessories so first one at being
Oh first one being this I got this when
I was in New York City it is the card
say love ring and it was for my hitting
1 million on Instagram I still can't
believe a guy's it's insane
I'm so happy so if you are wondering
what my Instagram is I'll have it linked
down below but I love it so much it's
the gold one if you can see beautiful
the month of July and also the month of
June I've been wearing these sunglasses
so much and everybody asks me about them
they look like this
they're from Sailor ah and they're the
surf line so this is the case that it
comes in and they're really cool it
almost look like goggles but I think
they're awesome so I wear them all the
time and I love them the only thing is
they're white so sometimes my makeup
gets on the inside but it takes two
seconds to wake them off yours I really
like these they are on the pricey side
but they are sunglasses and I own a lot
of sunglasses sunglasses are like my
obsession so I do invest in sunglasses I
just make sure to take really good care
of them I used to buy a lot of cheap
sunglasses and I they would always
always break and I just would end up
buying them over and over again so in
the end it kind of comes out to the same
I mean still this is still a little bit
more expensive but they're a lot better
quality and they don't break as easily
they're really cool if you can find
dupes of these totally go for it I just
personally couldn't find the exact ones
so I just got these ones next are shoes
that I've been wearing a ton this month
there are these ones they're like little
slip-on I call them grandpa shoes
because like my grandfather had shoes
like this they look like this they're
like what are these called loafers no
basically your slip your foot in they're
pointy and the real cool they're by the
brand robert's clergy class jvo i am not
too sure if they're from France and I
actually was gifted these oh yeah I've
been wearing these a ton they're super
comfortable and since they're just slip
ons they are really easy to wear
obviously they have never given me
blisters and they go with so many
different outfits I love wearing these
with like some ripped up denim
like an oversized sweater I think it's
so cute and then the two last clothing
items are vintage pieces so the first
one is this awesome
Rolling Stones t-shirt look how crazy
this is it's vintage I don't even know
what I think this is like a legit
Rolling Stones tea from like the like
80s or something cuz there's I mean
there's no bread or anything it's really
cool
distressed ripped up I'm obsessed with
it and I love the stones so this just is
the best I love it I go to New York and
I'm so happy with this fine so I own a
lot of vintage clothes now which I love
like this Tommy Hilfiger sweater it's
vintage it was in my Hall love it and
then the last thing is oversized denim
jackets I'm all about that so I got this
one recently it's so big it's literally
just its Wrangler and it is Anna sighs
extra extra large men's so it is massive
it's so big
but I love it so this I got off of the
ASOS website that has it's like their
marketplace they have a bunch of vintage
stuff and I just got this thing it was
ten bucks so it's really cute oversized
simple I have one similar but it's from
Nasty Gal and there was studs all over
it which I'm still obsessed with but I
wanted one that didn't have studs just
so it could be plain and this one is it
and I love it and I wear it over things
like this vintage tees jean shorts with
like cute sneakers or booties or shoes
like this which I love and I'm real
happy with the spine I it took me a long
time I look always do the men's section
for stuff like this because I want to be
real big and I looked for the cheapest
one and that's what it was where I'm
from we don't have much option for
vintage shopping so every time I'm in LA
I always go to Melrose and I always look
there but when I'm at home I can't and
online throw shopping is still kind of
expensive because of shipping and
especially shipping internationally
girl's gotta do what a girl's got to do
in the end it still ends up being
cheaper than buying this from like
sitter's so I'm still saving money I had
one more favorite I forgot to mention it
it's this hat I've talked about this
many times before I love it I wear a lot
and I feel like a train conductor when I
wear it
that's awesome these with like cool like
circle sunglasses and like ripped up
kind of t-shirt and jeans with booties
so cute so I hope you guys enjoyed this
video I'll have links for everything
let's sit down below as much as I can
find except for the vintage stuff I'm
not sure if I'll be able to find exact
but I will leave similar ones as cheap
as I could find and then also I'm
