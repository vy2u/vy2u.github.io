super quick I've been away for most of
the month like I was in Maine and then I
was in Italy for 10 days near the end so
there hasn't been too much stuff that
have been trying out in the month of
july but i have been kind of
experimenting with makeup and stuff
because i was away for shoots and doing
a lot of work stuff so i did have to put
on makeup which you know i try not to do
in the summer but sometimes it happens
and yes I look kind of washed out in
this lighting but I have pretty nice
time I know would you say so myself even
though it's not really going to show up
but anyways let's get into it so the
first thing that I bought at the
beginning of july that i was using a ton
of is a tinted moisturizer and this one
is by NARS it's called the pure radiant
tinted moisturizer and this is in the
shade medium too I got this because
tanya burr was talking about along her
videos and I wanted a tinted moisturizer
because you know for a while I didn't
like to her foundation in the summer for
one I don't like wearing makeup but I
wanted something to kind of even out my
skin tone and get rid of the redness and
stuff and kind of match the rest of my
body because for some odd reason my face
just is not 10 and so I need something
to kind of match the rest of my body
because it's kind of awkward so I picked
this up and I used it up until like mid
Italy I really really liked it not every
single day but you know the times that I
did want to have something to match I
would use it it's very radiant so if you
have oily skin I don't know how this
would look because I tend to have more
on the dry side so I do like something
that gives me a bit of like I don't know
not shine but like dewy glow do we
finish something like that and then for
foundation when on the days that i did
want to use foundation because if i had
a shoot or like you know some kind of
filming or whatever and i wanted to wear
some kind of foundation i've been using
the two-faced born with it this is the
new foundation that just came out
obsessed with this oh my gosh i'm
wearing it today I don't know how well
it picks up on camera but it just makes
your skin look flawless I love it it's
not too full coverage and
you let the smallest amount a little
mountain goes a long way it's very
buildable I use it all throughout
osheaga and it was hot and it did not
sweat off my face like the tinted
moisturizer does tend to kind of sweat
off my face this stayed in place it was
insane like it did not move I was
sweating like crazy and no crying
because it's so emotional and it just
did not budge also I have this like bump
here so yeah loving this this is in the
shade boldin because I am 10 even though
I look super pale on camera I promise
I'm not love this stuff so much and of
course there's a pump and the packaging
is just so cute guys look it's like a
matte color love it then the next item
I've been loving makeup-wise is the mack
wood winked I shadow I've had this
eyeshadow for years and I forgot I had
it and then the other day I was going
through my makeup door and I was like oh
my gosh I forgot how much I love this
it's like a goldie bronze color and i
use it just on my lid all over i've been
wearing it every every single day i wear
makeup i put this on just all over my
lid and i blend it out and that's all i
put on my lid and i love it just subtle
kind of shimmery golden tone it's so
nice for summer i love it obsessed with
it it's great then kind of going off the
eyes again i've been loving this mascara
it's my covergirl and it's called a
super sizer it's all over YouTube
basically so I was kind of like I want
to try it out and I did and normally I
don't like the plastic he tips but this
one is really really good makes my lunch
just look super long and full and volume
eyes and I don't I don't think this is
waterproof I don't think this is the
waterproof one correct me if I'm wrong
but it does not budge and I was like
again I wear this all osheaga and I was
sweating and crying and it did not move
it's not hard to take off so whatever
formula they use in this I love it and
it's a drugstore product so it's really
affordable you should try it out guys
and if you do let me know next is this
is actually really random but I've
really been liking these like kind of
box thingies of products so this is the
dew the hoola by benefit
and it's just this box inside comes with
all these products and I well okay I put
them in for the purpose of this video so
I could show you but they're all gonna
fall out now basically it comes with a
bunch of stuff that has to do with like
their hoola bronzer which is my one of
my all-time favorite bronzers so it
comes to the little packet of the hoola
bronzer with a brush I don't use this
brush I just use my regular bronzing
brush then it comes with the they're
real mascara which was a favorite of
mine for a very long time it's just
travel size which is great it's all
travel size then there's this thing
which is called this is called do the
hula and it's basically just a like
bronzing stick that you come at and you
put it around like the places you want
to contour and then you blend it out and
it's awesome then this lip balm and this
lip gloss on this side and it's great
because it's all in a package and it's
super simple and sleek and it just sits
on the counter like this and I like it a
lot so I've been grabbing this quite a
few times since the products are very
like Dewey summary that's what I've been
finding myself grabbing a lot for the
month of July plus it's easy to pack
because it's just like in its own
container okay now on to fashion
favorites this is very very random but I
went to the Taylor Swift concert in July
at the beginning and I picked up
obviously I want to buy t-shirt but I
got this like long sleeve gray oversized
shirt I asked for an extra large no just
a large as for large and it has been
like my go-to thing I sleep in it I wear
it out with like some shorts I think
it's so cute so yeah I this is random
but I really like it i think it's super
cute plus i love gray gray just like an
awesome color especially in the summer
with a 10 even though this does not show
anything but um I was wondering you guys
know where I can get a shirt like this
just like a simple gray long sleeve
oversized shirt that doesn't have like
the taylor swift tour in the background
because that would be awesome Joan
something where everyone doesn't ask oh
did you go to to horsewhip concert like
yes I did now on to some random
favourites this is kind of fashion
beauty I don't really know but it's a
nail polish and its first timer by I see
I wear this in like every single video
you guys know if you watch my blogging
channel if you watch any of my videos
you know that I'm always wearing this
nail polish on my fingers and I always
get questions about it so this is the
nail polish that i use it's the same one
that I'm always wearing first timer by
SC just a simple green color I love it
it's awesome next is this camera right
here this is the Instax Mini I got this
for osheaga music festival because the
first one in mine kind of broke because
I used it too much long story anyways
this thing is awesome I used it all
festival long and I took so many cute
pictures they come out like this and I
really want to like start rearranging my
room and kind of redecorating it not
fully because I'm not planning on living
here that much longer but um I want to
kind of like do this collage thing maybe
I like a video about it like a DIY like
I know tumblr e room posting I just like
that they're small they're really cute
really like them next random favorite is
this this is a coloring book but for
adults so this is called the color me
happy I got this from my friend
Katherine for my birthday and I'm
obsessed with coloring books if you
don't know like dyango buys new coloring
books all the time but this is really
awesome because you have these like
crazy intense pages and I hope you guys
are gonna be able to see and I find this
helps when I'm stressed or when I'm
anxious I use this a lot from what I'm
flying because it's just like like I did
this the other day I don't know it's

don't know the other ones but Calvin got
this for me for my birthday and I think
her so much for it because it's
beautiful I love it then the last
favorite of mine that's random and this
is super random but it is a jump rope
skipping rope whatever you want to call
it plastic and this reminds me of being
an elementary school I was on the jump
rope team we had this like jump rope
thing and I used to do all these crazy
things like I could do the pretzel which
is like you're skipping and then you
bring your leg up underneath
like underneath your arm you like put
your leg above it and then you continue
skipping like you do it all nice like
crazy things anyways I used to do stuff
like that and I don't know I just really
wanted a skipping rope and this is
amazing for exercise if you guys are new
to exercising and you want to do some
form of cardio but you don't like
running you don't like biking all that
stuff this is great because you're
skipping and it's so much fun and you
burn so many calories and you like are
so out of breath like do it intensely
