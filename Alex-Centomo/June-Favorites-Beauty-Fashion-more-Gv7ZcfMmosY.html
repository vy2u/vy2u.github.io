little crazy right now but don't worry
about it because it's summertime and I'm
not putting any heat in my hair I am
leaving it Oh natural plus I just want
for a run so it's kind of greasy and
sweaty so cute right right anyways let's
get into my June favorites Campbell in
June is gone say it all the time I feel
like this in shoes and true I feel like
this intro is the same for every
favorites video but what is this so I
guess we will start with makeup because
I only have two items from the month of
the june because there's been only two
things i've been loving because i don't
wear much makeup only when I'm filming
videos or something like every other day
if you watch my vlogs you know like I
never wear makeup unless I like go for
dinner or I'm filming so the first
product is this alpha matte lip color
it's what i'm wearing on my lips right
now a lot of people ask about this i
also have a lip liner that's very
similar from make up forever but this
was literally like three dollars and it
looks like this it's just simple and i
really like how easy it is to apply and
it takes like two seconds and super nice
and i've been loving this color this is
in the shade praline so it's pretty cute
ellicott the next pretty product beauty
product i have is by covergirl and it's
the super sizer mascara and you know I
you know of obsession with like my Too
Faced better than sex mascara and my
benefit um I'm gonna what's a cold
roller lash Wow blanked on that but I've
been trying this out and I've been
loving this from my bottom lashes it's
just like a really weird wand like when
I first opened it I'm like whoo hoo I
don't know if I'm gonna like that but I
like it super nice really good for my
bottom lashes it doesn't smudge which is
great because I have smaller eyes so
like mascara tends to looks much a lot
on me so I really like this and I've
been wearing it almost every single day
sometimes I put it on top but I just
really like it for my bottom lashes okay
next I'm going to go into skincare
because there have been two products
i've been using every single day well
this one every single day it's this
lotion it's a body butter body lotion
and it's by soap and glory glory and
it's called the righteous butter and
it's
smells amazing if you guys own soap &amp;amp;
Glory products you know what it smells
like and I just think this is amazing I
use it on my skin every single day you
don't need a lot because it like really
smooths out and it's super moisturizing
I get really dry skin no matter what the
season is in the winter obviously
because it's drier I get dry skin but in
the summer a lot of the times i'm in the
beach or in a saltwater pool so my skin
tends to dry out so this has been a
lifesaver i use it every single day love
it plus I smell really good i don't
really feel the need to wear perfume
because everyone's always like oh my
gosh you smell so good at like lingers
on your skin for a long time so the next
skin product i've been loving is this
mass it's by origins and it's called the
original skin retexturizing mask with
rose clay if you guys have watched a few
videos back I've shown like my skincare
routine and I was using the not primer
the serum that's from this line and it
smells so good and it's amazing so I
just discovered this clay and I actually
love it I use it around once to twice a
week depending on how my skin is doing
but it just makes my skin glow it's
actually ridiculous I think I'm gonna
film a video where I show how this
product works like I'm going to apply
and then take it off you'll see my skin
just looks like radiant I beginning a
lot of questions on my blogging channel
about how my skin looks so good without
makeup I think this is the reason I'm
not even joking like I love it so much
okay so let's move into fashion because
I do have quite a few like trends and
stuff but i want to i guess show you
that i've been loving in the month of
june i'll start off with shoes because i
didn't recent i got these like no more
the beginning of june and i've been
wearing them almost every single day
these are the superstar edita is just
the classic ones that are white with
black I got them from ASOS or a sauce or
asos I honestly don't know how to say
that website they're so comfortable I
was not expecting that I don't know like
it's there so squishy and like I love
them they go with every single outfit i
think i look so sporty and Q and these
are a trend and I'm loving them and my
mom said they're a trend when she was
young and now they're back on trend so
yay love them so much and they're still
really white I'm like really surprised
cuz oh wow okay the souls are really
dirty but you actually can't see on
camera they looks
white oh wait there may be lip balm next
trend that has been going around that
you know at first all but I don't really
know how I feel about that but I try it
out and I'm obsessed so they are
high-waisted bikini bottoms I finally
gave in and decided to try out of hair
so these are by free people they did not
send them to me i purchased them myself
and i've been loving them check it out
check it out so they i don't know i
don't i'm honestly like I wouldn't like
lie in the Sun for hours with these but
they're so cute if I'm going to a pool
party or a beach party and a lot I go to
a lot of those and a lot of times I just
like get together I'm not really in the
Sun I'm in the shade but it's like at a
pool or the beach and it's just so cute
with like a simple top and I just love
it so much so this is a light pink it
looks wet on camera but it's very light
pink inside there's like pink with white
polka dots tiny one so you can reverse
it if you like and then there's like
mesh material these things are mesh and
it looks really pretty on and I like it
a lot the next thing I've been loving
are like muted color t-shirts so this is
a muted purple or like a what do they
say hazy purple whatever but um it's by
brandy melville it's just a regular
t-shirt I don't know if it's picking up
purple on camera but it definitely is
purple it makes your town look so nice I
love wearing this with white shorts and
then these shoes think they're so cute
and sporty and i love it plus brandy
melville t-shirts are just so soft and I
really been loving these like pale muted
colors for summertime just they're super
trendy right now but I I'm all about it
I think it's so cute and then to go
along with that kind of outfit are
baseball caps so this one is from urban
outfitters I got it up in the boys
section and it's like a purple denim
kind of or like a light blue denim
and I think it's super cute you can wear
it backwards or forwards and I love
wearing it because also it blocks your
face from the Sun so you know got to be
protective over that kind of stuff okay
so the next two items are shorts but
there are two different kinds of shorts
so the first one are these high waisted
shorts from sabo skirt so these are just
really like they're like sweat patna
terial they're so cute so they're
high-waisted or you can wear them load
depending on what you like but I love
the high waisted sweat Pat material look
I think it's so cute wear it with a crop
top and some really cute sneakers I just
think it looks awesome and I can't wait
to be wearing this by the beach so
excited and then the last pair of shorts
are workout shorts and I recently got
these from revolve clothing they just
look like this and they're so light
weight their bio there by adidas okay so
there by adidas they're super
lightweight material very thin super
breathable but they're not see-through
and they're just so cute they sit right
on my hips very well when I'm running a
lot of times like shorts will go up or
down you know it's really annoying but
these stay in place which I really like
and they're super flexible and
comfortable plus I can even wear them
out for fun with like a cute little
t-shirt and it still looks cute because
they're black and I love them I love the
whole like sporty trend that's in right
now because I'm such a sporty person and
I love to be comfortable so like I'm so
excited about this and the last thing I
want to talk about because I have been
doing so many like not photo shoots but
like events and my just things I'm going
to wear you know I don't like she was
heat in my hair but I do enjoy to do
crazy braids and you guys know that i
love extensions when i do braids because
my hair is long but like it's not like
super thick and it's not exceptionally
um you know healthy on the ends i do
need a cut but with my extensions they
look so healthy plus these match my hair
perfectly so of course these are from
foxy locks they are the 24 inch sandy
blonde ombre extensions
and I just love the fact that they're
like super thick at the end so they
don't like my hair look so healthy when
I'm wearing them and I get so many
compliments guys like obviously I say
like all wearing extensions but still
people are like wow those are literally
the nicest extensions I've ever seen but
obviously people aren't asking they just
think I have like really nice like thick
healthy hair because they aren't too
much longer than my actual hair look my
hair goes down to my belly button now
it's just pretty dead these go a bit
past my belly button but just like add
health to the end so it just looks
really nice plus thickness and I find
doing like fishtail braids or different
rates like I have a bunch of tutorials
using these extensions that I could link
down below if you guys want but I just I
don't know I really like them and if
you're interested in buying extensions I
will have a discount code for you listed
down below where you can use to get you
know percentage off your order because i
love you guys so much so yeah if you
guys are you know with foxy locks they
help you decide the color of your hair
and also when you do order them it comes
with like a sample that you could test
in your hair but all the time like i've
ordered two before i had ombre hair and
it was perfect match my hair perfectly

questions if you ask them how you can
match their hair you send them a picture
they'll help you no problem so that is
all for my favorites for June wow I love
