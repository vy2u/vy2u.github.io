so I'm here today with my boyfriend's
little sister Trish and we did this look
on her today it was inspired by Kylie
Jenner they're both 16 years old so it's
kind of like an everyday natural look
but a bit more made-up so in case they
don't you know you want to go into a
movie or to the mall or whatever it's
perfect for any 16 year old and if
you're interested in seeing how I did
this look on her then just keep on
watching and yeah let's get started I'm
just gonna be over here doing her makeup
just so everyone knows but um yeah we're
gonna start off with priming her face so
that way she gets an even complexion so
I'm just taking this Smashbox
photo-finish light primer and just going
to put it all over her face before
foundation like this
shown your fingertips oh by the way my
hands are clean just if anyone's
wondering I'm not putting dirty fingers
on her face
um I'm just gonna lightly okay so I'm
just gently smoothing this all over
Trish's face and then even cohosh she's
so cute she's laughing and then I'm
taking this benefit for professional
primer it works the same as a regular
face primer except for this one
minimizes the look of pores and I just
really like it take a little bit on your
fingertip like that and you're just
gonna apply it near her nose so that the
pores around here they shrink up and
they look great for when you're on a
date so next I'm taking this Garnier
skin renew BB cream in light/medium I
really like this since it is a BB cream
it works as a cream and a foundation
together so it keeps your skin nice and
dries I'm using the Mac stifling brush
just like this to apply it I like this
because it doesn't get all the product
into it so what I like to do is I just
put a little bit because this is very
blendable so I put a little bit then I
go on circular motions just to buff it
into the skin
Smith
I'm taking my mac prolongwear concealer
in the color NC 20 just to cover up any
blemishes redness or dark circles
underneath the eyes
so I'm just concealing around her nose
because most girls get redness around
the mouth and nose it's just normal so
now I am just applying the concealer
underneath her eyes very gently and
tapping motions just to bring them up a
really good trick that I learned is when
you're out of eyeprimer you can just use
your concealer all over your eyelid and
then set it with your powder foundation
and it works just as well as a regular
eye primer I am now using my Mac 182
kabuki brush to set her foundation I'm
then taking Trish's mineral powder by
Maybelline in the color nude
I am then using NARS Laguna bronzer
where the holiday were her cheeks are to
her ear I'm just going to shade in a
little bit of bronzer towards her ear to
make the cheekbones look a little bit
more contoured and then you're gonna
bring it up to the temples of the face
get some in the hair so that what you
want to do is to get proper way of
putting bronzer is where the Sun would
normally hit your face which is kind of
like in a threey shape so you go from
the temple towards the hollows of your
cheek and the back towards the
underneath of your jaw like this that's
like where the natural light would hit
next I'm gonna be taking NARS is blush
and orgasm
I know mine's all ruined I dropped it
sorry
I am then using max eyeshadow in Naked
Lunch which is a pretty shimmery nude
color
then I'm going to be taking this sort of
sandy brown color that I have from back
I don't have the pot anymore so don't
remember the name but any brownish nude
color would work for this and then I am
just taking the color and blending it
into the outer corner of her eye and
pulling it into her crease using it
mostly as a base for the next brown
color that we are going to be using just
to smoke out the eyes a little bit more
then I am taking the color bronze Frost
by Mac
