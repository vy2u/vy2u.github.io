sorry for my videos lately if you guys
don't follow me on any social media you
will not know this but I was actually
away in LA on business I was there for
business meetings and just some shoots
and I also attended the AMAs which was
so fun and also the holidays are coming
up so I'm so excited to have some like
winter videos those are my favorite kind
of videos to make I love winter so I'm
so excited I'm also nice and cozy in my
sweater this is so soft and comfortable
while I was in LA I met up with so many
different people and I was able to
connect with so many different online
influencers and just brands and
companies and youtubers so I was
planning on doing some holiday shopping
when I was in LA but I didn't have that
much room but one of the things I picked
up actually really excited about because
I don't know I get excited for little
quirky things like this it's a little
ornament it's an origins ornament that
says joy but not only does it say joy it
comes with little products inside of it
from origins how freaking cute
you just closed it up like that itself
yes I love it
this is suck this would be such a great
gift idea a big big reason as to why I'm
all about this ornament is because
origins is actually doing something
really great for the environment this
year which obviously I'm all for so this
is like the special edition it's called
the what's it called again this is
called the treat stuffed ornament so
with every purchase of one of these
origins we'll be planting a tree in
partnership with global relief which is
amazing it's a perfect way to give back
for the holiday season for the
environment it's a perfect perfect gift
to give to somebody because not just
something like that was which has
products in it it's like it's something
that will be helping the environment I
don't know origins holiday gift sets are
great value for friends family yourself
it's just it's so fun I love their gift
sets so much every single holiday season
that I'm always purchasing them like I'm
not even kidding you over the past few
years you can ask my sister that's what
I get her for Christmas there's also
free gift wrapping at the origins stores
or online if you want to select the gift
wrapping option that way when you get it
sent to your door
it'll be gift-wrapped you do have to
worry about it because I suck at
wrapping gifts so much I try I really
try guys maybe in vlogmas this year you
will see me attempting it so you can
check out these products at your local
origin store or wwm
origins calm I will have a link listen
down below if you want to click it and
check out all the products and
everything like that again great cause
and jingles and thank you to origins for
partnering with me for this campaign
honestly I love the fact that for every
purchase of that you get to plant a tree
I'll start off with just some of the
clothing items I bought so the first
thing I got this t-shirt flannel so it's
a it's a flannel but it's very very very
lightweight and very soft this is from
the brand rails and I own something like
this and I brought to London and I got
heaps amount of questions about it just
where I got it cuz it's very like a
light material so I loved it so much but
I don't want to bring the exact same one
to LA with me because I just wore it
with so many outfits so I got one that's
kind of similar but it's grey with like
pink light pink stripes I don't know if
it's picking up on camera but it's just
very very pretty I love the way it looks
on me I love tying it around my waist
it's very soft it's actually really cool
wearing it as a t-shirt like buttoned up
then you unbutton the front pieces here
kind of like a Harry Styles look with a
necklace it's super sexy and cute and it
looks really good with a tag cuz I got a
spray tan before LA for a shoot so I was
so pretty and I like I just love being
tent being pale it's also snowing right
now where I'm from so yeh the second
shirt that I got which I got so many
questions about when I was in LA oh my
gosh like literally everyone asked me
about this shirt is this oversized like
I guess button-down and looks like a
denim jacket but it's not it's actually
cotton material it's very very
comfortable I roll up the sleeves are
actually wear it as like a dress like a
long t-shirt with like I wear black
shorts underneath so they just peek out
a little bit and I have it super
button-down like that and I wore them
with black booties a black hat and a
really layered necklace that went down
pretty low and I got so many questions
about this people seem to love this
because it shows a lot of leg it's very
open here which I really like to show
like what is this called again a dick
clintus i don't know if i said that
completely wrong but like that area it
shows a lot and i just really like the
feeling of this it's super comfortable i
wore it a lot like in the evening and at
night because for some reason in LA
when I was there was like a heat wave or
something it was like 33 degrees Celsius
I don't know what that is Fahrenheit
it's like times 2 plus 30 so I don't
know like in the 90s if that makes sense
I'm not sure whatever I got so many
questions about this this is from Free
People I got it when I was there and I
just really liked the way it fit they
only had a size large and I didn't want
to buy the large but I try to know and I
was like oh I have this outfit in mind
and I wore it in a video coming up this
weekend from that I did like I get ready
with me kind of thing for LA so you'll
see what that looks like in that video
and super random but I went into a store
and they sell this it was like a I guess
like a boutique or something on Melrose
and I just needed like a simple t-shirt
to sleep in but I actually ended up
loving it it was it's a boys t-shirt and
it's BBG which they sell at Urban
Outfitters so it's actually from bdg
which they sell at Urban Outfitters it's
a men's shirt in the size is large it's
so big but so soft and so comfortable
I wore this okay I'm really weird I wore
this with like my just one teaspoon
black shorts with this tucked in so it
was really loose and baggy over here but
then it was tucked in so you couldn't
say how long it was and with some black
booties which I'll show you in a second
so freaking nice I really really liked
it and I don't know what it is with grey
I just have an obsession with grey but
especially with a 10 it looks so good I
don't know I like it a lot so then the
next thing I got were just a simple pair
of shorts these were sold in a boutique
so they look like this they're I wear
them high-waisted and I wear them a lot
to the pool and if it was hot at night I
would just wear them to bed they're from
szabo skirt actually but I got them at a
boutique there um so yeah they're really
really comfy and cute super soft it's
like a mob like a pale or muted purple
color really like that shows a lot of
leg you can even like I wore this out
one day with my booties and I had a
sweater which kind of covered which
almost made it feel like I was wearing
pajamas but it worked guys I swear word
and like I had my denim jacket over it
which was really cool and I felt very
trendy no I'm also getting sick then the
next thing I got were a pair of
sweatpants which I kind of splurged on
but I felt them and I was like these are
the softest things in the entire
and I wear them every single day they're
actually very dirty so I apologize if
you see any disgusting stains on the
button to wash them they're from Paige
they're literally black sweatpants like
just simple black sweatpants but they
are the thinnest softest material in the
entire world I don't know what it is it
feels like like a cloud like I don't
know how explain this but it's stretchy
and soft and I went into the store at
the Grove and like the workers were all
like oh my god
do not even touch those you're gonna
believe with them and I was like no I
need to and they were like uh-oh and I
touched them and I bought them so the
last clothing item I purchased was
actually my dress for the Amaze I was
thinking of purchasing a dress and then
returning it afterwards as bad as that
sounds but sometimes I do that if it's
something expensive but I just fell in
love with the dress so much and it just
suited my body type so well and I
literally don't own any dresses so I was
like you know what I'm just going to
keep the dress and I'll wear it for like
Christmas or any occasions that I have
because it's so beautiful so I got at
Nordstrom and it is a for love and
Lemmons dress so it looks like this this
is the top I don't know how to explain
this neckline but it basically like
there's little there's look out
underwire bra so it holds your boobs in
place gives you really nice cleavage and
then at the waist it goes in and it's
actually pretty long like this is the
bottom and it goes all the way to my
knees but from the back really shows my
butt nice it's lace and these are the
straps very delicate and thin the back
goes a little bit lower it's just so
beautiful so I wore this to the AMAs I
got a lot of questions as to where my
dress is from so it's for lemon lemons
now as for shoes so I got two pairs of
shoes the first pair were actually a
gift and they were sent before LA so
technically I didn't get them in LA but
I the first time I wore them was LA and
obsessed so they are the same Merle
booties that look like this how nice are
these these are I don't know how people
spend money on this
I'm just being quite honest this is
extremely expensive like I got them as a
gift and I cried I actually cried I
don't know if you follow me on snapchat
but I was crying when I opened it and I
with taking pictures and just crying but
these are like they all cost me an arm
and a leg but they're the kind of things
that they're so comfortable and they
form to your feet and they just are the
best things ever that if I were to lose
them I probably would buy them because
I'm obsessed with them the only issue is
I didn't get the souls like like I guess
sealed not sealed but like protected so
now they're all like this on the bottom
which I want to get them fixed I if you
guys have any recommendations on how to
fix them and then keep them from not
doing that literally Nicole just yelled
I don't know what to do
the next thing I bought were oh my god
I'm actually embarrassed to show you
these because they're really dirty I got
a pair of Louboutins shoes I've always
wanted a pair of Louboutins like ever
since I was 16 and I've been saving for
them for so long and I knew exactly that
I wanted these pair so I want to wear
them in my dress at the Amaze they're
these shoes except look at the bottom
guys really bad so yes this this outfit
for the AMAs was a splurge they look
like this they're dirty on the inside
and do you want to know why because
these were the most uncomfortable
freaking shoes in the entire world my
friends all told me that you have to
wear them like 12 times before they
actually feel comfortable on your feet
but I wanted to dye the whole night I
took them off and I actually walked
barefoot on the street and that's why
they're dirty because I put them back on
after and I had cuts all over my feet
like all over my toes right here I was
like beauty is pain but like you know
what it's not worth it it's literally
not worth it's not like I can return
them either because look at the bottoms
but I mean lesson we learned they're
beautiful
don't get me wrong Louboutins are
beautiful but to be completely honest
you could probably get a pair of heels
that look the same that don't kill your
feet and then the last thing that I got
from LA was from Joe Malone
so this is the candle mm oh my god it
smells freaking amazing so this is the
wild fig and cassis it's one of their
most popular candles but they're
actually discontinuing the scent of the
perfume slash Cologne whatever the one
that I owned which I'm so upset over
because it's my favorite scent ever but
the candle they're not discontinuing
because it's like the most
important not important but like what's
a called bestseller um so this candle
actually a friend of mine in LA he
always burns them like constantly
throughout the day so he got me one so
technically this was a gift it's also
good for him but he had like a million
lying around mmm it smells so freaking
good if ever you guys want to know what
I smell like go to a Joe Malone and
smell this so that is everything I got
when I was in LA um I didn't do like
crazy amounts of purchases but the
things that I did buy were a lot of
money so I'm kind of stressing out about
it a lot but it's okay because I'm very
good at saving my money actually so I'm
just I'm just justifying it in my head
okay guys I'm sure a lot of you struggle
with this as well I hope you guys
enjoyed this video if you have any other
suggestions for winter and holiday
videos please let me know in the
comments down below well I'll leave like
in the description like what's on my
lips my nails and the sweater that I'm
wearing because I know I got a lot of
questions about that kind of stuff and I
don't I love you guys all so much and I
will see you all in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
