sitting down to film my most requested
video ever it is my I guess loose curls
hair tutorial I don't know like my
natural everyday curls except they're
not natural because I do them with a
straightener anyways on my Instagram
which I will link down below I have a
lot of pictures of my hair curled a
certain way and I get tons of questions
in the comments like how do you do your
hair oh my god show me tell me how what
curling iron to use and I actually don't
use a curling iron I use a straightener
which may sound weird but I'm sure most
of you guys know that people can curl
their hair with a straightener and if
you don't then thank all your watching
this video because I will show you how
to do that there's not really like a
specific technique I think I do this
differently every single time so it
always looks different before we get
started I just want to say that this
sweater that I'm wearing is the softest
most comfiest sweater I've ever owned in
my entire life it's so warm and cuddly
and it's just really big and cozy it's a
high-low so it goes like really poured
out on my butt and I really like your
lot it's from winter and I will link the
little like leg thing down below so you
can go click on it and check out the
store check out the sweater and let me
know what you think so yeah without
further ado further further ado let's
get started the first thing you will
need is hair protective spray and I
swear by this stuff because I you have
blonde hair with my tips and if I don't
use this the heat from the straightener
will completely damage my hair and ever
since I started using this I've seen a
huge difference in
the ends of my hair of my split ends and
it's just not as sprayed and my hair's
action rolling as you guys can see
finally also living my roots grow out
natural ombre the best so yeah this one
is just Tresemme it's the keratin smooth
I guess he protectant spray I don't know
I just really like it smells good the
next thing you'll need is a comb is a
comb and this one is just a wide toothed
comb it has like two sets
I don't really know explain this is a
little like hook thing which I don't
know what you can use that for but I
just really like using this because it
isn't pull on your hair especially pick
out a shower in your hair is like the
most brittle and weak it's not super
strong cause it's wet I like to use this
because doesn't break my ends and
everything like that so I just use this
to brush out my hair and then the last
thing you'll need is a straightener and
this one is just a get a straightener
that I got from I don't even know where
I've had this for so long
and normally I use my GHD straightener
but that one broke and then I bought
another one when I went to Australia and
then when it came back the plugs looking
and having a plug converter so it on
whatever I'm gonna get into that but
anyways I've been using this for a
couple years and it's great so whatever
just use whatever it works for your head
okay okay so when I turn my strainer on
I just put it to the highest heat
setting I know that's not the best thing
to do but I just do that so
I just realized because I have second
day hair right now and yesterday I had
like braids in my hair and put some sea
salt spray in it to give some texture so
I hope this works now because it's like
kind of crispy and a bow for the low so
I'm just gonna start brushing it from
the ends down everything is smooth
there's no knots or anything that oh my
god once that's like somewhat combed out
you can just throw that away then I will
take my heat protectant spray I like to
kind of spray it everywhere and then the
last couple parts of just spray my
super-dead tips
so I guess I guess I'll start off with
my bangs which just seems to be bangs
we're gonna call the head bangs super
cute right okay so I always curl my hair
away from my face if I curl towards my
face I just find I don't know if I don't
like it wouldn't you curl it away from
your face it's very like windblown when
it looks like very natural and I just
find it's more flattering for your face
PS excuse my nails they're very rapture
right now I'm sorry uh there's no excuse
okay so the top section here I'll just
kind of strain the roof and then when I
get around
we made the way through I'll just twist
the strainer and just pull like that's
literally all I do it's like you see
that that's actually all I do is just
twist and pull okay so what to do move
bangs again cool so start from the roof
straight twist
I'm looking here it's because I have I'm
just looking in the viewfinder and then
you leave like this and you're done okay
I mean you don't have to put it on the
highest heat setting I just do because I
don't know do not do that I probably
show it because it's probably breaking
my hair more and I'm twisting and I'm
pulling and it's not like smooth it's
kind of getting caught that's just
because I have sea salt spray in it
which I probably shouldn't be curling my
hair right now because it's probably
damaging and the reason why I like to
kind of straighten the top is because it
gives it more of that like loose like
fallen out curl rather than there like
the tight cross training from the roots
I just like that look a lot better but
it's personal preference so if you guys
want to start your curl higher up you
can do that see even this right now like
that's too curled for me so I'm gonna
have to like fix that leader because I'm
very weird with my girls
if you really want to be more precise
you can do your hair in sections but I
just kind of pull it over strands I find
it's more messy that way
and again I'm going away like this what
I like about straightening that what I
like about curling your hair the
straightener is that the ends won't be
like a curl like a ringlet they'll be
kind of like straight at the ends which
was very like mary-kate and Ashley Olsen
serger like 2002 these pieces here like
my dad my dad bang things I look
sometimes go up and back things like
that so gives like a nice sort of thing
I am by no means a hairdresser I have no
idea what I'm doing I kind of just
experiment with things and I've never
even watched a tutorial on how to do
this properly to be honest
I hope you guys can see what I'm doing
so again this side I always go away from
the face
aha we're getting somewhere here so from
the front it's really really nice and
kind of just like a windblown sort of
love oh and the sections of strands I
take are different every time I don't
have a specific size it's dry they kind
of just grab whatever obviously you
don't to make them too thick because
then it won't curl oh my gosh my pet
peeve is when girls curl or straighten
their hair but they forget to do the
roots from like back so make sure you're
doing your back sections just to really
get the roots properly because you don't
want like creepy hair just pull away
and don't worry if you guys can't do it
the first time cuz I do a lot of girls
hair like this for like the punishments
or whatever and then when they try to
recreate it they can never do it
properly so don't give up if you can't
do it right away just keep practicing
keep trying this even when I first
started I didn't know what I was doing I
was kind of just like like whatever
playing with a straightening iron and I
used to like flip out or in my ends and
then I just kind of like started
twisting and playing around on my hair
everyone's hair it's different so don't
be discouraged if you you know you try
to do it it doesn't work out right away
the reason why I started doing my hair
like this was actually because of Miley
Cyrus because I don't you know if you
guys remember when she had like her
super long brown hair and it's always
like really loose bohemian curls I
thought I was like playing around my
curling iron and I realized I can never
get like loose curls without doing a
bunch of stuff using a strainer in there
to like straighten out the ends or
whatever so I just figured why not just
curl my hair with a straightener here's
like a back section
away
I hope you guys can see what I'm doing
properly I really apologize if you can't
because this is actually really hard to
explain even though it's so simple like
there's no like step by step it just
kind of grab sections whatever section
the side is on I curl away from my face
and there you go look a curl oh do you
guys have Instagram if you have
Instagram what's your Instagram leave it
down below I'll go follow you that'll be
fun we can be friends friends through
Instagram look at my arm right now i
have also layers in my hair so it's like
all different lanes plus whoa that's
smokin plus the back like top like these
sections here are actually really dead
because part of what I used to dye my
hair I just once you're done it kind of
just like to finger comb through it and
this is the part where you can normally
add hairspray but for my hair I don't
need hairspray just because it holds the
curl really well I have naturally wavy
hair this is it this is how I curl my
hair with a straightener nothing too
exciting nothing too hard I guess just
keep practicing it sometimes the top
part I want to add more of volume
without teasing so
do it upwards that way oh look see okay
