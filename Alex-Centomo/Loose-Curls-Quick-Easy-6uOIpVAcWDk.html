channel if you've been subscribed to me
for a long time or been watching my
videos for a long time like really long
time you'll remember one of these videos
I put out like I think two or three
years ago it's my most viewed video and
I've always kind of wanted to recreate
it in a different way because I get
still to this day of so many comments
unlike people so confused over what I do
if you're familiar with this picture
this was a picture that I think Dan took
of me a few years ago when I was living
at my parents house and it like went
crazy over social media like celebrities
were reposting it I wasn't really
getting recognition for it so I kind of
started recreating the same type of
picture with different outfits just so
people knew it was me because my face
obviously wasn't shown but the main
question was how I did my hair like that
I do it differently now I usually use a
curling wand but the main way I used to
curl my hair was with a straightener and
I feel like this is a lot more common
nowadays but back then I don't think I
never really saw anyone doing this on
YouTube and so when I did it for me my
sister was to do it all the time so so
simple for us to do my friends hair like
that it was just really really simple
and when I made the video for me it was
just easy because it's what I was like
used to but so many people were so
confused saying it didn't work for them
sometimes I go back to the video once in
a while it's got a few million views and
I'm just like man I wish I explained it
differently and so you know what I'm
just going to redo this video now this
is a warning because this is going to be
a very chitchat II video if you don't
like a lot of talking then there's just
really no point in watching this I'm
gonna get started first thing you'll
need is heat protectant I already put it
in my hair and I forgot to show it but
basically any heat protectant works
Tresemme you can literally get at the
drugstore it doesn't matter just
anything to kind of protect your hair
from the heat I try not to use heat on
my hair often but once in a while I
really like to I'm shedding right now
what the heck second thing you'll need
is a comb I did this in my last video
any kind of a wide toothed comb will be
good um I don't really use a brush but
comb is fine I mean if you want to use a
brush it's fine it's up to you but the
way I comb my hair is I start from the
bottom and I work my way up that way I'm
not like completely pulling on all the
knots I'm kind of just brushing them out
I shed like crazy I find hair everywhere
so onto the next step is getting your
straightener but type of straightener
you use it's actually really important
and that's the one thing I didn't really
talk about much in the last video
because I use a really really old
straightener that might like long hat or
something I don't know so old I don't
even know the brand name but a
straightener that's small with the
specific heating and specific plates
makes a huge difference so that is one
thing that's really important this
strainer here is the one I use actually
the box right here so I could show you
exactly this is the box it's the single
pass luxe by t3 I love it it's in it
says the number one professional
straightening and styling icon it's 25
millimeters so that is how a big it is
and I love that it's white and rose gold
I think it's so beautiful the way you
turn it on is here you have the
different heating settings which is
really important a big reason I like
specifically this Brad is because they
make their styling tools with tourmaline
or tourmaline I'm not sure exactly how
to pronounce it but basically the way
that tourmaline works is that it doesn't
actually damage your hair it helps make
it look healthier and fuller and it's a
lot more gentle on your hair which is
for me you guys know how I feel very
important because this is like a custom
blend tourmaline plus ceramic plates
what it actually does is it helps to
quickly close the cuticle of hair so
that it retains moisture hair look shiny
for a really long time just helps it
overall keep it really healthy and since
it is a custom blend it's like made for
that specific reason also there are five
adjustable heat settings so between I
think it's 260 to 410 degrees so it's
really customizable for what you want
for whatever kind of hair style that
you're going for I have on the 4th right
now so just keep in mind I have curly
fine hair but I have a lot of
like a lot of strands so it does get
knotted very easily go based off of your
hair you don't want to go overboard I'm
really glad to be collaborating with t3
on this because they're able to offer a
giveaway for you guys so I'll have a
link listed down below which you guys
could check out and you could enter with
that link so definitely go check it out
go click the link and if you do end up
getting the exact same one let me know
because that's pretty cool and if you
recreate this hairstyle let me know okay
I'm like so rambley basically what I do
is I just kind of section off my hair
and start curling so recently I've been
taking like half of my hair and I'll
take one of these clips that actually
comes with the straightener
I just clip my hair back in a really
cute way then I'll start with a piece
that's like closer to you guys like
rather than the back of my head so the
first thing I do is straighten oh my
gosh this is like memories straight
until around like a quarter down then
twist and pull sometimes I'll do it like
if I don't think the top is nice I'll
redo that part
there you have a curl so I'm going to
show you also the sections I use are
kind of all over the place but I
typically do curl that's closest to my
face i curl away and then I alternate to
straighten the top curl towards go down
okay I'm trying to think of ways where I
could show you guys like really detailed
so you'll know exactly what to do kind
of straightening out the little curls I
got on top
sometimes I go half way twist
see how it's twisted and I pull down
make sure you got a good grip on it all
the way down and there's a curl
everyone's hair is different remember
that so if it doesn't look exactly like
mine you can always go over the curl
again just try to keep it the same
direction
literally curling around the barrel and
pulling it down and because the
straightener is so good it's like really
smooth on my hair and see how like the
bottoms aren't completely curled I just
throw that back on to the next part
I'll do here
their bottom section is where you can be
like the most messy because you don't
really see it's more like the top where
you really want to focus on the
straining part especially if you have
curly hair
are you seeing this this hairstyle is
super quick super easy does not take
long to do
and it looks really cute
sometimes they'll go over the back
pieces near the roots just to make sure
their curl up straightened not curled
then take this clip the back of my hair
Oh perfect timing take this part down
and this is the part where you try and
figure out where you want your parts so
I sometimes like middle part I sometimes
like side part but I think for the
purpose of this video I'm going to use
side part but not total side like here
use my finger and I'll start with this
side because there's less hair make sure
it's calmed no knots
okay now see how I missed a little
section at the bottom here I don't know
if you could see that can you see that
if you can't it's like a little frayed
so I literally I'm going to go over that
like last curl and just wreak roll that
so it's all uniform hopefully here I'll
put it against the couch you can see the
curl right and what's great about
curling with a straightener is that it's
not too ring liddie and also the way
that it falls looks like just such a
loose curl so effortless and just so
pretty I also don't have very thick hair
so for me it's super easy to do this
again it depends on your hair depends on
the type of curl you want if you won't
lose your curls take bigger sections of
hair I'm taking like an inch section I
really hope you guys can see this
there also looks great on people with
short hair because you can make it look
so nice if you just do like little curls
like this and then you put texturizing
spray and you kind of mess it up I think
that look is so nice
I still have friends to this day but
look at that video and try to recreate
the curls and it just doesn't work for
them and then I watch them do it it's
because their hand positions are all
weird like literally hold the
straightener like this you guys know how
to strain your hair right and then when
you get to around halfway wherever you
want to start the curl just twist it
like not all the way around like twist
it once and pull if it helps to use both
your hands like that you could do that
just keep pulling also looks really nice
if you have layers in your hair because
then you get kind of curls all over reds
and right now my hair is kind of all one
length so it might look a little weird
but I still really like it the pieces
surrounding your face are the most
important because that's what most
people see when they talk to you
obviously you can worry about the back
after
now this section what I do is kind of
straighten up I go backwards like that
see then I take my hair out mess around
with it a bit so I could definitely see
how some pieces like here are a bit too
straight so I'm going to go back in with
a straightener and fix those pieces that
are like on top but as you can see this
is how it turns out so you got like some
straightness on top some nice cool cools
curls on the bottom and eventually they
will end up falling down because that's
just what curls typically do but they're
not as tight as like you'd get with
other like curling wands and stuff so I
hope this video was a lot more like
informative a lot more straightforward
again I'm so sorry if you can't do it
right away
seriously keep trying don't give up and
if you have any questions feel free to
leave them down below I'll definitely
try and answer them as detailed as
possible but honestly the key to this is
practice and um yeah I really like the
way that it's extrude curl in a little
bit straight at the bottom you got that
nice wave nice loose curl and yeah it's
pretty for any kind of occasion and they
last a freaking long time because it's
with a straightener don't forget that I
