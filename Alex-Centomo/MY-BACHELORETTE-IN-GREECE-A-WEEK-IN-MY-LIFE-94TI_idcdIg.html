Bachelorette games I have no idea like I
think they find a scavenger hunt I have
no idea what we're doing so I don't see
what we get up to alcohol this trip so
we'll see how that goes
hi guys it's Kyla and we're about to
start the scavenger hunt for my sister's
bachelorette party and Miko knows I'm
gonna start off I chose something that I
want her to do well should I explain
like what we just say we have a list
okay we have a list of things that we're
gonna tell my sister to do today in
order to complete the scavenger hunt and
we're gonna film it and take pictures
I'm in the first one I'm gonna tell her
she has absolutely no idea hi guys by
the way Sophia that here in the back she
has no idea what the list of things are
so I'm gonna start off so the first
thing listen come in the video with me
so that they can see your reaction
okay so the first thing that I'm going
to get you to do is you have to go up to
a guy with big muscles and ask if you
can buy tickets to the gun show and then
you get bonus points if you take a photo
grabbing his biceps let's do it
you have to flex your biceps thank you
okay
second task alex has to go up to a guy
and say you've been looking all over for
him and make sure you call him chat like
oh my god I've been looking for you
everywhere Chad okay stefanos okay we
met Stefano and he's gonna draw a flower
on Catherine oh wow thank you so much
that was really funny she literally to
Kate he walked
guys guys guys listen there can you want
them to listen so he walked by and he
smiled at Kyle and she smiled back hey
guys
Sophia and so the next challenge is that
basically it was supposed to be like
somebody gives Alex a piggyback ride but
she's wearing a dress and I'm like in a
thong so it would fly up right so like
I'm the only one in shorts so I guess
we're gonna do that all out she like I
choose someone and she asked him to give
me a piggyback ride she's cool
we're gonna find someone cute awesome
or all four of you could do it but like
you have to like actually bring her okay
next one is ask a guy to sing six
seconds of a Britney Spears song okay so
next challenge is to dance in the back
of somebody's photo okay so the next
thing I like has to do is take a picture
with the guy she's never met prom style
and if we can get some flowers and it's
a bonus points hi guys okay we were fast
forwarding a little bit now we were
currently in Santorini
we flew yesterday from Mykonos to Athens
and Athens to Santorini checked into our
hotel and I don't know if you guys have
been following me or subscribed to me
for a while but three years ago exactly
I was at this exact hotel with Dan and
we always said we wanted to come back
maybe for our honeymoon or we didn't
know we just knew we wanted to come back
because it was our favorite place in the
entire world and we're back and this
time we're here with Tess and Pat and
Katherine and I could not be more
excited and happy about it so the hotel
is the San Antonio hotel in I don't know
exactly the town it's in but it's in
between pita and yeah so it's like in
between the two main cities I literally
am just explaining where we are but come
say hi yay
over here especially if you use earrings
oh they're gonna be heavy
hey pause this is our room this is dad's
like thing with it is all your ankle and
Pat's rain his ankle - guys how cute
made it to Santorini well we're in ER
right now compute aful this is
I put my hair up literally sweating so
much we came for a coffee well more like
iced coffee and a bunch of water because
we were just walking around everywhere
we saw them we listened to some people
play some music we have just been kind
of exploring and now we want to go in
yeah made it to the Black Sun look the
best Sun is black it's like a lot bigger
than regular sand but I mean all sand is
just many rocks right but this is so
cool so everyone got their food this was
mine but I ate it I had fries with
tzatziki and a Greek salad while I'm
eating this right now oh yeah we might
have found fishies with the goggles
thanks to pat so cute and then Catherine
said she saw me swimming and like my
legs were just sticking out the water
like was it like I'm tired okay
goodnight frickin funnest thing of life
I love ATVs I want one back home we're
gonna do a shot for Tessa's video
driving the ATVs oh my goodness okay
we're good to go today is the next day
guys I actually have done my makeup so I
look somewhat presentable right now this
is the top I'm wearing and I just wanted
to quickly explain what I'm doing with
my hair because I get so many questions
about how I do my hair naturally on
vacation so I just showered and wash
my hair when I got out of the shower I
braided it in like a back braid and I
wait for it to dry a little bit probably
I like 70 to 80% dry then I take it out
of the braids and I spray it with sea
salt spray and the sea salt spray that I
use is this one by way so I like the
smell of it in my hair hi dad and then I
wait for that to set and I do my makeup
and then when it's done it gives me this
like really nice like curly type of wavy
beachy look and then what I'm doing now
is I'm adding in my lucky hair
extensions to add some length I've said
multiple times in my videos that luxy
hair one of my favorite things about
wearing extensions in general is that
like I've had these curled for probably
like three months now and every time I
put them in I don't have to restyle them
I just kind of like add them in and even
though my hair isn't curled it's just
wavy when I put it all together it
actually looks really nice before I put
in the last set I just want to show you
guys like it looks kind of gross and
ratchet right now but I'm gonna show you
what I do so basically this is what my
hair looks like the extensions without
all the tracks in I use the seamless
collection and this isn't the blond
balayage type because it's like a
natural foliage my hair does get quite
light in the Sun so I've been in the Sun
a few days now so my roots aren't as
dark as they are in the winter even
though it doesn't match like perfectly
it still gives a really nice effect and
I love like how shiny makes my hair
that's why I like to wear it and
especially on a day like today where
we're going into town we're doing kind
of a lot of different things that don't
involve going in the pool so I figured
I'm gonna have long hair today because I
want to feel like a Greek goddess and
cat candy cat 73 is just dancing behind
me this is the story of my life keep it
for real cat look do you like my hair
with extensions yeah so nice yeah I
think for my wedding I really want to
have like long hair
like just might not for links but my
hairs like well add so much more like
hair my sister yeah like my sister has
short hair but she adds an extensions
that are also short that match her hair
length to add volume oh and I did cut
them they were in a custom length but I
did cut them to make them more like I
guess suitable for my hair length and
I'm just going to add in the rest and
I'll show you what I'm gonna do for be
honest right now I didn't curl my hair
but my extensions are kind of curled
does it look really bad like should I
put like maybe some hair back oh you
should necessarily do it and like you
could do it on a pony but I feel like
you should do half up half up mm-hmm and
maybe braids because these top layers
like you can plant a towel yeah right so
or what if I could have been braids you
could do a braid yeah yeah without
looking at my outfit yeah okay thanks
Ted and if you want to get a set of
Luksa here for yourself
use the code out to 2:05 for money off
your first order links down below love
maxi hair and you mean Alex whoo okay so
I decided to pull it back in like a
little tiny braid but having some pieces
out oh hi what okay this piece is like
really annoying
oh well cute if only I had like not a
black elastic but I could edit that out
in photos wow where we are wait I did
what you did where are we
PETA yeah we just walked up these stairs
and it was kind of brutal it was
literally like maybe 20 steps and we're
dying it is and steep we just got to
this restaurant that cat has actually
been before because she was here in 2013
14:14 say shit 10 oh hey that was
actually really good of course fava

neighbors and the spicy cheese and the
same amazing thank you hold my back for
one second

walking down some steps to find a really
cool look out view oh wow look at that
statue the boats the volcano island hey

glasses but we're just shopping around

bracelet for all of us and we've been
looking around for the past few days
