channel I decided today to film what are
my arms doing right now I decided to
film a Q&amp;amp;A today so i asked you guys on
Instagram to leave me questions and I
got so many questions like I was not
expecting I got over 700 questions
within like less than 24 hours and I had
a lot of trouble picking ones that I
wanted to answer just because there were
a lot of like the same types of
questions that a lot of really
interesting questions that I want to
answer that I I snow the video is gonna
be so long if I answer so many of them
so if you guys like this video then i'll
probably do more so let me know by
giving us thumbs yeah by the way I know
minutes so many questions about this the
lipstick that i'm wearing is the Kylie
lip kit in candy ki just got it in the
mail and I really unevenly overlined my
lips really badly so I'm sorry if it's
distracting to you because I just looked
in the mirror I was like ah screw it
whatever Yolo so I am going to start now
so I screenshotted a few questions delft
underscore to 435 asked if you could
only live in a single place on earth and
you could never travel around the world
what would that place be that would
literally suck because I love traveling
um but I think probably like somewhere
in the UK just because I love it so much
there and I just think it's so beautiful
and the architecture and everything is
just amazing I think personally for me
that's probably where I live or like
Sydney because you got the city life and
the beach life so you get like best of
both worlds so i don't know i really
like Sydney when I was there Adele Antos
asked do you think doing a sport you
don't enjoy anymore is worth the time
and happiness because I'm in this
situation right now and I need help
thank you so I thought this is a really
interesting question because I dealt
with this oh if you guys don't know I
was a competitive swimmer for 10 years
at a very high level like I was training
oh my gosh
like literally 10 times a week for hours
on end and it consumed my whole life you
know like I went in a special sports
program in high school to be able to
train as much as I did and the reason
why I ended up quitting was because I
just didn't enjoy it anymore and I
wasn't happy and I think that I do not
regret that decision at all i don't
think that all i wish i stayed longer
could have done something like no I was
really unhappy I did not enjoy it and I
think as as long as you're doing
something that's like recreational
recreational or like a hobby and you're
not happy doing it then there's really
no point in doing it there are so many
things in the world that you guys could
do that can make you so happy and if
you're just doing like a sport because
you're being forced to do it or you
think that you know it's better for you
or something I think mental health comes
before physical because without a strong
mental health you'll never really become
fully strong everywhere else so if it's
making you really unhappy I say bye to
that do something that makes you happy
because you only get one life and I mean
at least for what I believe you only get
one life and you want to make that life
the happiest you can so that is my piece
of advice for you but make sure you look
deep down inside and think like is it
actually making me unhappy or am i just
being lazy because there's difference
between the two julienned otros asked if
you could only watch three TV shows what
would they be friends the office and
keeping up the Kardashians because those
are the three that i watch all the time
obviously keeping up the Kardashians is
still playing but friends in the office
isn't I just watched them on repeat some
obsessed Daria underscore menia I think
that's how you pronounce her name sorry
if I butcher it asked what are your
travel plans Germany maybe I love you I
love you too um I would love to visit
Germany it's definitely on my bucket
list for future travel plans like in the
near future definitely these are all
like on my list that I will be visiting
very soon so there's Iceland Portugal
Ireland who knows maybe things change
and I'll go somewhere else but don't
worry as long as you follow me on social
media you'll be
to see any time going anywhere and I
would love to meet you guys from
wherever you're from I just want to like
give you all big hugs cuz it's fun makes
me happy what is the last emoji that you
used Elvis's IM just dot a dot mermaid
are you really a mermaid though because
that would be awesome so the last emoji
I used was if I go into my texts it was
the kissy one the little kissy face
Shelby I'm Martin I think that's why you
say Shelby IE Martin asks where do you
see yourself in 10 years this is a
really cool question because it's kind
of impossible to tell so I see myself
married with kids um living in a house
with children I want a lot of kids well
we'll see I'll have one first and see
how that goes and then go from there but
I've always wanted a lot of kids and
down wants a lot of kids as well so I
see myself being very happy I see myself
with Daniel I see myself continuing to
do YouTube we're continuing to make
videos and just being really really
happy like that's just what I say so
very minimalistic foot I just want to be
mom you know mlss weight is up to us as
or 3 s's yeah mls srt asks have you ever
been unpopular and how have you dealt
with it yeah i was a huge dork and like
all of elementary all of high school
like really like glasses braces so dorky
looking no sense of style never wore
makeup I only wore makeup the first time
before my prom at the end of high school
and it wasn't even a lot of makeup I
just put a bit of bronzer on and lip
gloss like yeah and now this is what I
do for a living I just thought that you
know it made me stronger as a person as
a character and I'm able to deal with
like hate and like not really let it get
to me I have thicker skin I don't know I
feel like I like the fact that I wasn't
like a popular person in high school
because it made me appreciate a lot of
different things I never had people like
doing whatever i wanted for me I had to
kind of like work to be not to be liked
but like worked I don't know how to
explain it basically it was a growing
experience I'm happy that it went that
way wonderstruck like wo ND
strk that's cool asks if you could be a
character from your favorite series who
would you be and why Michael Scott from
the office that's who I'd because he's
awesome so this question is from a nuke
van ham she asks i know that you also
have anxiety but you also have social
anxiety because you are so good with
people so I thought if you have social
anxiety how do you deal with it um my
whole life I've had social anxiety I was
such a shy child like I would be so shy
even in fron of my family like I go to
my grandma's house and my mom would say
like when before we got into the house
I'd be like I'm gonna be shy like that
was like my thing I've said before I
like 12 anyone's houses and I was so shy
as a kid and I was never want to be very
outgoing and like going into school and
stuff I was always friends with the more
quiet people and I just wasn't like that
i never liked to be center of attention
I actually hated it the fact that I've
been asked to do somebody meet up
sending meet so many of you guys youtube
has actually helped with my social
anxiety so much even though right now
I'm just talking to my camera in my head
I know I'm talking to you guys so it's
like different like I feel like I'm
talking to a friend rather than talking
to like my camera but talking to people
in general like I used to be so awkward
like have you guys ever been in a
situation where you're with a friend and
then they see a friend that they know
but you don't really know the person so
they start talking and then like they
introduce you whatever but like you're
kind of like not really involved in the
conversation I never knew what to do in
that situation I would like go on my
phone I would be so uncomfortable so
awkward and I remember just thinking
like why is this so hard for me to just
stand here normally listening to them
talk like why do I feel so uncomfortable
why do I have to like pretend to go on
my phone and like I just realized that
that was just a form of social anxiety
and it just made me so uncomfortable
like that's just like a small example of
like okay you know but I just nowadays
if that happens I just kind of like look
at the person I I kind of just like non
my head is if I'm like interest in what
they're saying and like that's it and
now talking to crowds of people I just
realized that like I don't really care
what people think about me anymore like
I just I'm really happy with myself so
talking to people i just always talk to
someone pretending their friend
fine that's just what I do and it just
really helps and that's that what was
your most embarrassing moment um oh gosh
I've so many embarrassing moments okay I
have to one of them is not as bad as the
other so one of them I had an oral
presentation in university when I was
still in the University and I'm so
stressed over the whole presentation
because it was a group presentation and
I have to speak for five minutes
straight which is not that long but like
for me before I was like doing YouTube
and stuff was very shy person like I
said and I was just very very nervous
and I just want to make sure I had all
like I memorized it I was prepared I
dressed really nice i did my makeup on
my car drove to school got to class
which is like a big auditorium class
like the really big ones walk into class
my group looks at me they look down at
my feet and they're like you realize
you're in your slippers right oh my gosh
I had to give an oral presentation with
slippers on my feet like the big hog
slippers you know like they weren't augs
they're from like I don't know like
Target or something but they were furry
like big ones and I was like oh oh my
god cuz it was still warm outside so I
was like near the end of the year so
around this time and like it was warm
out so I was so used to going out on my
slip my sandals might flip flops
whatever so I just wasn't thinking and
yeah I gave that oral presentation with
slippers on and I got a really good
grade and I got a bonus mark for wearing
slippers to an oral presentation in a
business class that's so embarrassing I
think another embarrassing moment this
one is like one of those things like the
slipper when I'm kind of like I laugh
about it cause like people thought it
was funny and like whatever it's like oh
my god like typical Alex or like yeah
that could have happened to me this
moment is like something that you know
you think back at these moments when
you're it's like late at night and you
just like you think of them when you're
like oh like literally you get those
like chills and you're like oh what'd I
say that why'd I do that like so
embarrassing so basically oh my god i
really want to do this um so okay what
happened was I was with my good friend
Kat Bell you guys know her she's one of
my best friend
and my sister is one of her best friends
Nicole so Nicole she works at this like
restaurant / nightclub but it's like
it's a lounge but whatever she works
somewhere downtown and she was with her
friend and we were invited to meet a
celebrity and like hang out whatever and
I was kind of like okay I'm down
whatever it's cool like a group of
people just hanging out I can't say the
person's name just cuz we have to sign
papers and stuff I'm sorry like I know I
literally hate him youtubers talk about
something and they can't say the whole
thing but I can't see the person's name
basically we hung out and at one point
during the night the person I was like
sitting with Nicole we were talking and
the person was like talking to another
person I'm like that person's friend who
was also joined us for the night so him
and his friend were talking and I was
talking to Nicole and he came up and was
like oh what are you girls talking about
and we're like oh nothing haha whatever
were just joking so he comes to sit in
between us and as he's like sitting his
like butt is like coming towards my face
do you know I said I was like don't fart
on me like what oh my god literally said
that Nicole looked at me she was like
her face was just like like looked at me
he thought it was funny he died of
laughter but I was I like think back to
that moment and I'm like why did that
come out of my mouth like literally why
did I say that like that's so
embarrassing him and I are friends now
so it's no big deal but just sometimes I
need to think before I talk because
things just come out of my mouth
sometimes sometimes I say really
embarrassing things to my parents as
well and I'm like why did I say that and
they're like I don't know Alex what's
wrong with you I'm like I don't know
struggle the struggle is real oh i
forgot to say who asked me that question
oh no I can't find it I'm sorry I can't
find you anyways someone else asked I'm
not going to forget your name Jules dot
Mary asked where's your sweatshirt from
in the picture that I posted on
Instagram where I asked question where I
said ask me questions my sweatshirt was
actually from it was just a random main
sweatshirt I got it in Maine when I was
there last summer it's just like a big
oversized sweatshirt that says made on
it
I really like it though Holly dolly
honest what filtered to use on Instagram
i always use a five that's like my
favorite filter and that's the only
filter i use and then I just edit like
the saturation the contrast the
brightness all that kind of stuff also a
lot of you guys are asking like when are
Daniel and I gonna get engaged that's
such a like awkward question because
obviously i don't know like it's up to
him really I mean I'm I could propose if
I wanted to but I i want to get proposed
to yeah I don't know it's up to him
probably sometime within the next year
I'm assuming I don't know it's really up
to him go ask him guys enjoyed this
video if you did make sure to give it a
big thumbs up and I'll make sure to do
more there are so many questions I feel
like you guys have I really want to make
an updated how i edit my Instagram
pictures because I get literally so many
questions especially recently so many
people are asking questions about that a
lot of people get annoyed over the fact
that my hair looks a lot more silver in
pictures than it does in my videos
promise you it looks more silver in
person that does in my videos as well
but it definitely is coming out and also
I use the filter a five for all my
pictures that I edit and that does give
a more white tint to the photo itself so
and I use just my Instagram pictures as
my thumbnails because why not right well
like seriously why does that change your
life over the fact of what hair color I
have or don't have like I don't get it
anyways I'll owe you guys all so much I
hope you enjoyed the video i just said
that and i will see you guys all on my
