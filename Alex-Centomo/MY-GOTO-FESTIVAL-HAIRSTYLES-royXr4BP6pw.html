channel this year has just flown right
by it's insane how fast the year won but
the same time it feels like it was the
longest year ever does that make any
sense
probably not anyway is I always
considered festival season starting with
Coachella because that's the first
festival I go to of the year I know
there are a ton throughout the year but
for me and what I watch online it kind
of starts with this one and then they
kind of build up until the summer time
and there are so many festivals this
summer that I'm going to and I'm so
excited let me know if you guys are
going to anything but the biggest
question I get about festivals other
than the fact that like did you enjoy it
what music did you like all that kind of
stuff which was mentioned in my previous
video if you guys want to watch my time
at revolt festival all that link down
below but I get questions all the time
about my hair and I feel like the reason
why I get questions about this so much
is because this channel started off as
like my hair channel type thing like I
used to film videos all about my hair
and I was just like I just used to love
experimenting with different hair styles
and then it just got to the point where
I felt like I was being repetitive so
then I decided to experiment with other
things but this video I wanted to bring
it back to my roots and talk about my
hair again because I get questions all
the time about my hair and I don't want
to just keep referring people to older
videos which for one are also very
embarrassing I had to I feel like I
could just explain again in a better way
because I feel like I'm a better on
camera now if that makes any sense more
comfortable can express myself in a
different way if you guys are new here
make sure to hit that subscribe button
the thumbs up too if you want but hit
that subscribe button as well as turn on
the bell for the notifications so your
post notifications are turned on so you
guys always know when my videos go up
because man it has been a struggle to
get my viewers you guys to watch my
videos but enough about that let's just
move on to what you guys are clicking on
this video for which is my hair so right
now my hair this is all natural like I
mean natural a sense if I'm not wearing
extensions I do dye my hair I get like a
balayage type thing I got it done right
before Coachella so it's nice and fresh
and my hair goes down
- around right under my boobs I curled
my hair with a curling wand if you guys
are curious to see how I did that it is
actually my most viewed video on my
channel so I'll link that down below but
I'll also link a newer one because that
one's very embarrassing like you can go
back and watch it but I was so awkward
it was just I mean I'm still awkward so
maybe nothing has really changed but
yeah that's a whole video on its own but
it's my favorite way to curl my hair I
think it just looks the most natural cuz
I have naturally wavy - curly hair so if
I just use a curling wand I get like all
these flyaways then I end up having to
go into the strainer anyways so I prefer
just to use a strainer to curl my hair
simple as that now when it comes to
festivals especially I love wearing
extensions because I love to feel like
an inner Vanessa Hudgens before I ever
went to any festivals I would always go
to her for any kind of inspiration when
it comes to the season because she is
just like a full loading fairy Bohemian
Princess and it is just like my inner
self just wanting to oh I just love her
so much
I love her style I loved her long hair
especially like there was a time in like
2008 I would say were like every Disney
Channel star like Miley Cyrus Miss a
Hudgens Ashley Tisdale like they all had
the long long hair the extensions and I
was obsessed with it I don't know if you
guys know what I'm talking about you
probably do party in the USA like all
that that whole era was like extensions
it was my job and I had a really short
hair this is really going off-topic but
basically all I'm saying is I really
love to wear extensions and my favorite
extensions to wear I've been wearing
them for years you guys know already but
luxy hair extensions are just the ones
that feel the best on me they are the
closest in color they have like these
are the ones I have they're the blonde
balayage and they're in this seamless
collection and I do recommend this
collection especially because they're so
thin they feel like nothing they're
super lightweight you don't see any
tracks like they're just super flat
against your head oh hi so I just prefer
these they are custom length I just I'll
have a link listed down below of the
exact ones I use and if you want to use
the code election 1205 you do get money
off your first order so there are three
hairstyles that I feel like
I have showed them in multiple videos
before maybe not one of them but this is
how I've been rocking my hair this is
how I wore my hair at Coachella and this
is how I will be wearing my hair
throughout the summer at the other
festivals they are so simple what's
great about these hairstyles is you
don't need super long hair for them if
you do have short hair they look great
maybe - one of them because I feel like
with fishtails you kind of do need more
hair but you can just like play around
with it and make it your own
definitely perfect thing to do so let's
just dive right into it because my
intros are always the longest thing I'm
going to start off with the most simple
one and I get questions about this
hairstyle all the time and I'm like what
the heck this is so easy but first of
all let me just put in my extensions
real quick because I need to have my
long hair been going hard at the gym
lately
so as you can see it just adds so much
hair oh yeah and these are just
previously curled from like I don't even
know how long ago the curls last forever
and the extensions so I mean already
just like this super cute festival look
right like just having long bohemian
hair you can just add like cute little
clips or whatever it might be I'm gonna
go in with what I've been doing so all
you will need for this look are clear
elastics bobby pins if your hair doesn't
stay in place but I also like to use
these banana clips which fun fact I
actually wear my hair like this one of
the days I Coachella it was a different
hair clip oh I also messed that up but I
had like two clips like that but
basically this is just gonna be two
space buns on top of your head but messy
all about the messy look all about the
messy hair because it's bohemian it's
not supposed to be perfect so as long as
you have a middle part like I do right
now again doesn't have to be perfect I'm
gonna grab a section that I'll start
with the left side so I go from like
where my eyebrow is and I kind of just
bring up my finger along the crown of my
hair until I get to around the back and
then I just lift that up either separate
it and then I just pull it back come see
come so this would be so cute even if
you just did a ponytail that would be so
cute okay that's a look but we're gonna
go into this space buns I feel like most
of you guys know how to do this already
but if you don't I'm glad you're
watching this video so what I'm gonna do
oh what I'm gonna do is I'm going to
just take the ponytail and you can
actually tie this in a ponytail if it's
easier but I'm just messy so I just wrap
it around my finger
see how it's like going around my finger
I should probably bring my camera down
or I'll just swipe
hi oh no I messed it up already okay
make sure it's focusing on my hair take
your elastic you tie and a little thing
and then you pull it out oh there's a
little piece ok hide that so that's one
grab my clip just making sure I'm
clipping it from the back into place so
it stays going onto this other side
doing the same thing starting at my
eyebrow going straight back
huh how fun you want to be who just left
it like that and then it to add a cute
little finishing touch I got these
butterfly clips off of Free People I
just add them right here gives a little
detail and this is the first way I wore
my hair at Coachella it was the easiest
hairstyle it stayed in place like
because I have the clips I could dance
around I can jump I could be free it
could be freeze if I'm like not free you
know anything like I could just be
whatever and then having the long
extensions just makes the look so like
ariana grande I love it see what I mean
and another fun thing is if you have
like jewels and stuff even from the back
on to the next hairstyle hairstyle
number
Dule so this one again can be done with
short hair but I really recommend
extensions cuz I just think like I said
you look like a fairy princess you're
gonna start off with your hair you're
gonna take a section on the top front
like just here I mean doesn't have to be
perfect it's just like a front section
that's like maybe a one-inch section and
what you're going to do is you're going
to just make a simple braid here in
three pieces and I braid underneath the
middle strands so you're just gonna
braid all the way down and I like to
braid pulling my hair towards the back
just because I'm going to be pulling my
hair towards the back and again all
you'll need for this are clear elastics
and then leave a good amount near the
end because you're going to be pulling
out the braid five lipstick on my teeth
at all in this video I'm so sorry leave
that for now we're gonna do the same
thing on the other side
okay now you have these two braids like
this so what you're going to do is
you're gonna pull out this braid like
crazy make it messy make it look like I
said went swimming in the ocean with a
braid it's gonna look crazy but don't
worry it's gonna be cute okay that's one
two then you're going to hold these back
and connect them I'm just going to use
this butterfly clip but you can use
bobby pins you can use any kind of clip
you have so the braids look like that
and then the next thing you're gonna do
is take a chunk of you're going to leave
a little chunk of hair right here but
then you're gonna take another chunk and
you're gonna braid this piece down you
do the same thing on both sides again
under the middle piece
and then the same thing right here
and this is another way I'm gonna be
wearing my hair so again this is a very
bohemian I love the look with the long
hair I think it looks very fairytale ask
on to the final hairstyle this one has
been shown on my channel multiple times
but I still get questions about it daily
so I figured I would just do an updated
one of how I did it last week as well as
how I'll be doing it for the rest of the
summer to fishtail braids if you guys
don't know how to do a fishtail it's
pretty simple I find the more you
practice the easier it gets
I find it even easier than doing a
normal braid again practice makes
perfect so all you will have to do is
well first of all I don't use the
strands in front of my face split your
hair in two and then split this section
into two this one I do suggest having
extensions for because you're gonna want
the length and the thickness to give
that really big bohemian fishtail look
so you split your hair in two and then
all you'll have to do let me just move
this away all you want to do is take in
a small section from the outside and
cross it over and connect it and then
you do a small section from this side
cross it over that connect it and you
just continue to go all the way down
that way
I'm not gonna go all the way down cuz
you guys get the point clear elastic and
then the best part is pulling out the
braids you just literally pull on the
hair out to the sides the extensions
help so much with making the braid look
super thick and super full awesome okay
now on this side I'm going to show you
how to do a mock fishtail braid which
again I have shown on my channel but
this is an easier way to do a fishtail
braid if you find this too complicated
which I do suggest this way this is my
favorite but this one looks similar it's
just done differently so let me just put
these pieces to the side again put your
hair into two so you're basically gonna
take the sections and twist them towards
each other like this when they're
twisted you take an elastic tie it
together split it again in two and twist
again towards each other every like two
inches I would do another elastic
as you can see that was much quicker the
braid isn't gonna be as nice in my
opinion but I still think it's gonna
look really good pull it out there you
have it two different style of like
fishtail I prefer this one this one
still does look really cool it's just
different and then my favorite thing to
do obviously I would have both sides be
equal because that's just me I mean you
can do this if you wanted to but stay at
a headband so I have a bunch of
headbands these are all from Free People
I wear this one this year it's gonna put
it and it just makes any hairstyle look
way more bohemian and that's my
signature look there you have it guys
three different festival hairstyles that
I am personally loving this year as well
as all year's I feel like I always do
this okay everyone that is it for this
