channel if you hear any weird noises
right now there's someone mowing their
lawn right outside I just wanted to
quickly intro this video back at home in
Montreal because I did not do this video
properly I feel like I kind of effed up
a little bit please correct me if I'm
wrong but like I saw a few of these
videos going around the internet and I
was like this seems like so much fun and
I was about to leave for my trip and I
was like how fun would it be if you guys
helped decide what I did for the day was
my Bachelorette cuz I thought that would
be so fun
not realizing then all of my bridesmaids
had stuff planned so then I kind of
improv a little bit of certain things if
you guys don't really know what I'm
talking about there is a tag going
around the internet I don't know who
created I'm so sorry if you do please
comment it down below so I could give
proper credit where it's due
basically my followers on Instagram it
decide what I do for a day and a lot of
times it starts in the morning when
you're at home and throughout the day
they decide what you do I was in Greece
for my Bachelorette not knowing my
bridesmaids had specific things planned
I'm definitely to be doing another one
of these videos back home so it'll be
like the full day if you guys want to be
involved with that make sure you follow
me on Instagram because I'm gonna be
posting all about it they're all my
stories and you guys can actually decide
what I do for the whole day if you're
new here make sure to click that
subscribe button down below and give
this video a thumbs up if you want to
see another one you want to see what we
did in Greece then keep on watching I am
doing the video today where you guys
decide what I do today on Instagram we
don't have that much time to get ready
so this first one is gonna be really
quick but today's officially my
Bachelorette and I asked you guys if I
should keep my hair natural or curly
like curl it did I say straight and did
you see my poll I think I wrote straight
so we are actually gonna be heading down
to the pool to take our Bachelorette
pictures probably just gonna put my hair
in a bun for that and then do my hair
when we get back for the rest of the day
but that'll give you guys enough time
and to vote on my stories what I should
do with my hair I should keep it natural
or curl it I really hope you guys say
curl it cuz this is so ugly but up
the day I'm gonna have to do what you
guys say so hopefully you're nice okay
guys so I have my little tiara that says
bride-to-be I'm keeping my hair in a
braid while you guys vote on my story
and we're gonna go down to Tigger
pictures these are the bathing suits
with his mine oh my god
hi okay guys so we just finished getting
our picture they were so stupid all of
them and here's everyone yay it's early
in the morning so we're kind of tired
and we're hungry but we got the picture
look how pretty the view is okay guys so
it looks like you are voting for curl it
which is so nice but thirty nine percent
said natural it was like oh my gosh No
so I suppose like finish breakfast I'm
gonna go curl my hair up hi
you're cute is it good thank you so
fresh sponsored by orange the color okay
guys so I'm asking you on stories now
which dress I shouldn't wear I was
thinking of wearing this one tonight
because we need to wear well the girls
asked me to wear all white and then
they're wearing black but I also like
this dress so maybe I'll wear this one
for the day but I'm hoping you guys
choose this one but if they say this one
that I'll just have to wear this all day
yeah like we're in black like it's gonna
be a contract true I just did my hair
you guys voted for curly so that's what
I did but I used a straightener and now
I'm just waiting about the dresses but
it's like 48 percent to 52% right now so
it's super close so I'm gonna wait like
10 more minutes to see what you guys
think but I need to get changed soon
because we're supposed to go catch a bus
so far the flower one is winning for the
day so I'll wear that one and then maybe
tonight with the white one okay guys so
it's a really close call but you guys
voted 51% for the left one we need to go
catch the bus so it's been around 20
minutes so I'm gonna go with the left
one I hope it doesn't change throughout
the day but I'm gonna wear the white one
at night so in the end I mean we're both
I just quickly asked you guys which
shoes I should wear these ones are like
little diamonds and there will not real
diamonds but their foot flops and these
have a tiny heel
and they wrap around the ankle so you
guys are voting right now for the no
heels and the sparkly shoes and then I
asked you guys which Sony's I should be
wearing the heart one or these ones and
I don't know what she's gonna win but we
have five minutes before I hate to leave
but cute I don't know why I'm saying 61%
of you said no sparkles the Sony's no
hearts for 80% of you guys so I got the
sparkly flip-flops on and I'm gonna
bring the new set up in no hearts hi
guys it's Kyla and we're about to start
the scavenger hunt for my sister's
bachelorette party and Mika knows we
have a list of things that we're gonna
tell my sister to do today in order to
complete the scavenger hunt and we're
gonna film it and take pictures so we
are in the middle of doing a scavenger
hunt right now clearly there's gonna be
two options so I'm going to ask you guys
on Instagram which one I should do first
so the first one was go up to a random
guy and say I've been looking for you
everywhere Chad even if they're not a
Chad and just be like oh my going to be
looking for you everywhere and then
what's the other one no no that might
mice it wait pause it okay guys so in
the middle of doing a scavenger hunt
right now and I'm gonna ask you what's
on Instagram which one I should do
between two so the question is I have to
draw on somebody either a heart or a
flower or no you ain't asked them to
draw on me okay they have to draw on
Katherine either a heart or a flower so
I'm gonna ask you guys on Instagram now
whether they should draw a heart or a
flower and it's gonna be really funny
she volunteered herself because I feel
bad drawing she's a well yeah I know if
someone's made me a Kaylee drawing on
stephanos okay we met stefanos and he's
gonna draw a flower on Katherine
[Laughter]
[Laughter]
thank you so much hey guys we're back at
the hotel now my camera unfortunately
died so I couldn't show you the rest but
I just asked you guys on Instagram if I
should have red lips or if I should have
nude and most of you said red 63% of you
actually let me show you
63 percent said red so that's what I'm
gonna do
I'm also changed whoa what is that one
also change into this white dress that
was also part of the picture from
earlier today but I figured I would just
wear this one tonight since all the
girls are wearing black and I'm weighing
white and then I'm gonna have little
Tara it's as bright to be these are the
shoes I'm wearing from Ray they're
really comfy and Tess is doing her hair
she's cute okay lips are officially on
yay all right now the last thing I'll
probably ask you guys is what I'm gonna
get to drink for my first drink on my
Bachelorette I'm gonna have a bit of
alcohol tonight oh yeah
okay guys as you can see that is why I
messed up the rest of the night
literally we got for dinner we played a
few fun games kind of like who's most
likely to so basically you explain who's
most likely to do something and there is
a full list they had written out we did
it over dinner like I think I had one or
two drinks and I felt so sick and it
just kind of completely ruined the rest
of my night I like went home I went to
bed it was not the greatest thing ever
but it was fine the next day was super
chill so I wanted to try do another
round of this typically I'm like a
perfectionist and I would just like
refill this video back home but I do
want to show these memories because like
I'm not perfect I'm a human being and
like this is me attempting something and
failing hardcore and like you could just
laugh at it because why not let's just
all laugh together I love you guys so
much I will see you all in my next video
which was my sister I'm so excited it's
already edited it's going up I'm like so
stoked about it so bye finish sippin an
amusement park we come to life when it
turns dark
we're just carnival hearts you and me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
