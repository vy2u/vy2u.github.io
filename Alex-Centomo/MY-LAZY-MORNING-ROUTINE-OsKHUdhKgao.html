channel it has been a bit of time since
I've done it get ready with me video for
the morning time so I have been really
focusing on myself this year really
focusing on my mind my positivity being
one and not letting any kind of stress
or negative impact in my life kind of
bring me down and I felt like I could
you know share this with you guys so
this is a lazy day routine meaning that
I do this on days where boom
he has my sock where I am NOT like
either shooting or having any meetings
or going downtown I'm literally just
chillin either going for brunch or just
like hanging out at home so without
further ado let's just get into the
video
every morning I usually wake up with
kind of a clouded head and that is
either because I'm having crazy dreams
or I was a little stressed from the
night before so my favorite thing to do
every morning is just to cuddle with my
puppy for a little bit he's getting so
big if you guys watch my last get ready
with me video I'll have that link down
below but oh my gosh how much he's grown
even since then
so my favorite thing lately has been to
meditate in the morning meditating has
helped so much when it comes to clearing
my head making sure that I'm feeling
positive for the rest of the day feeling
motivated relaxed and doing this first
thing in the morning I think is the most
beneficial for me because that is when I
you know sometimes I wake up feeling
very stressed or anxious and that it's
just helped a ton ever since I started
doing it and you can meditate throughout
the day as well but I just thought that
in the morning is the best for me during
a lazy day which is typically Sunday
that is when I like to take time just to
hang out look down or my friends or
family and don't do any work so I don't
work out on this day I head to the
bathroom I wash my face and brush my
teeth it's the first thing I do I didn't
film myself a brushing my teeth because
I honestly completely forgot and also
because I was filming this at like 1:00
p.m. but I'll have all products that I
use listed down below but it's just what
I have been using every single morning
during the past month getting myself
pampered and does feel really good and I
have noticed this past month that when I
do get myself ready even if it's not
like a crap ton of makeup on my face but
just making sure my face feels nice and
clear with Foundation and one cute
outfit my hair is done
I do feel a lot more confident and I
like going out during the day feeling
that way because even if it's one day a
week I just find it helps in my mood
overall and that has been kind of my
goal this year so making sure that I use
whatever makeup I want if you guys feel
the need to wear full face of makeup you
go for it because it all depends on you
I used to not wear any makeup and just
be like whatever but I found that my
mood was also becoming whatever and so
was my motivation so putting on a bit of
makeup feeling really pretty doing my
hair
been such a life changer for me and as
for hair I actually have a really good
trick for doing your hair in under five
minutes without using any heat and
having it look so nice extensions are so
important for this like so important and
I use my luck see hair extensions this
video is in collaboration with Lexie
hair so thank you so much for
collaborating with me again on this
video
they are awesome you guys know I've been
working with them for years the only
extensions that I love I stand by them a
hundred percent I do have a custom
length but all their lengths are really
nice I know everyone's kind of chopping
their half now so they even have like
lengths that could work really well for
you guys if you want to see what it's
like to have a long hair again because
you know it's fun to switch it up or
even to add volume but what I think is
awesome is when you look curl your
extensions they last for so long and
I've said this many times but I feel
like I cannot stress enough because my
biggest tip is to just keep your
extensions curl do a really big braid
with your extensions because no one's
gonna be able to tell that you haven't
done your hair and it looks like you
styled your hair and it looks like you
took a long time to do your hair so one
of my favorite things to do is a back
braid that's really pulled out so I
start like the crown of my head and I
start doing a Dutch braid all the way
down just grabbing big chunks of pieces
as well as extensions and then securing
it with a clear elastic and as you could
tell from the bottom the extensions are
still curled so it looks like you curled
your hair and then braided it and it's
so pretty you have Rapunzel hair I feel
like I'm the girl from tangled if you
like Mandy Moore oh my god this is us
okay if you guys watched that show you
know what I mean
I was so nervous for next episode okay
Superbowl episode I'm just gonna be
waterworks but anyways besides the point
it's just a really great way to do your
hair in under five minutes and have it
look like you took a lot of time to do
it if you guys are interested in getting
a set for yourself
use the code alex 205 for money off your
first order yeah I really
I do suggest them like honestly because
it just makes your hair look 10 million
times better without really having to do
anything so I'm using no heat always a
plus for my outfit I am wearing this
really cute top I got from brandy
melville and these jeans are from
citizens of humanities I got them off of
revolve and these boots there are dr.
Martin and I don't remember which one
they are I think are the vegan ones but
they were a gift honestly you can find
dr. Martens anywhere as for my necklace
I'm wearing my lumen kala necklace the
crescent moon that I designed with
stillness and I'm so excited about it it
is the best seller so thank you guys so
much for purchasing this necklace so
many times it does come in silver as
well as rose gold not just yellow gold
so if you guys want to check it out I'll
have a link listed down below but yeah
that is it for my get ready with me I
have been feeling so energized and so
positive and so happy lately and a lot
of it has to do with you guys there have
been things this past month which has
made me feel very like stressed and
upset and it took a lot of I guess inner
thinking to really realize that I can
control all of that I have the power to
control the way I feel and act towards
things I can either let them make me
feel really sad really upset or continue
the stress or I can do something about
it so I decided I'm going to be doing
something about it and I feel a lot
better
in my head right now it's it's great
when you feel good inside your head it
really like makes everything easier a
lot of it does have to do with you guys
