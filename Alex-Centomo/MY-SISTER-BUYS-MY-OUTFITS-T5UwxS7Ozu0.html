pieces missing and I also put a lot of
freaking blush but I'm excited for
today's video because I'm making my
sister buy my outfits and we actually
tried filming this in the past where she
look ordered off line and for some
reason the four times that we tried it
it didn't work what the order was
cancelled it didn't go through something
happened and we were like okay we give

what I got you Lee's favorite they
should all be favorites no we talked
about you the beginning of this video
why you'll see watch it uh-huh okay Li's
I want you is Sarah and I was kind of
inspired by what you're wearing now oh
okay okay
sure what's inside yeah she's okay oh my
god your size eight though so you have
to wear them with like socks thanks dad
these will probably not fit I don't love
all black sneakers I prefer all-white
but they're still really cuz I think
that's a shouldn't have and like looks
like something you'd wear yeah
Oh cute what is this a t-shirt dress the
future will always be yours choose it a
hundred percent free that's actually so
cute and I love the color and I figured
you could wear them together it would be
cute for like a picture that actually
would make positive quotes I love green
it makes my eye color pop cuz they're
green especially this color green I like
the quote and I actually like that the
black shoes are gonna go with like the
black font yeah plus black sneakers like
you can wear them with literally
everything so I don't hate it for sure
but I want to see what it looks like on
me yeah I'll give you the the score once
you've tried to try it it on I like it I
actually really like it
shoes are quite big I feel like it's not
exactly your style but it's still cute
I mean it's copy yeah yeah exactly
that's exactly what I was the shoes are
big the way the shoes are big but I
could wear them like big like it's cute
but it's totally not your style
it's very boxy looking it's not like a
cute oversized
outfit number two the outfit number two
so I wanted to do like different this is
when I was like still cared about like
what I got it
this was like oh I'll do like different
outfits for different scenarios kind of
thing okay so what's this scenario I
went to San Evita it's the nuke
it's like workout inspired are you
telling me I should work I was like oh
maybe this is gonna like inspire her and
like I went full out like oh I almost
got a thing you got me ass work yes well
as well or your focus oh my gosh I love
it right now because when we dimmed what
I got for Christmas link will be down
below at the beginning video my mom's
like trying to crawl behind to like not
be in the shot but we totally saw her
okay this is like automatically but this
is like a 10 on 10 just for this like I
know that I don't think you have I have
one but I lost it oh I mean I had
another one I thought you know that but
like you bought it for yourself or
whatever there's no
in the back so that when you workout you
can like know what this is so cute okay
like honestly just ten on ten just the
fact that you got me a great sweater
because you were sitting I love it what
size is it large perfect I love it
yay and there's a little I think it
would be so cute with a sports bra yeah
okay that's the second outfit right no
there's one more thing
Oh shorts so when you workout my god you
like them oh my god I love actually I
was literally trying to imagine like you
running around your house with like well
the woods and this morning I was
literally because I want to go for a run
and I'm like where all my freaking
workout shorts like they're all missing
I don't know where they are and I was
like I didn't know what so much in my
pants so I literally ran and like pajama
pants this was the shower that I could
so longest and because I wasn't sure if
I should get you legging
I'm so excited no I'm so that's like
perfect I actually needed that so thank
you oh yeah I love this the shorts look
really good on you
so cute yeah do they feel comfy you're
so calm feeling especially they're
perfect okay not tight so cute awesome I
really like this I get this I'm dying on
ten the only reason why I'm at ten on
ten is because I wouldn't necessarily
wear these together okay so this is the
first place I went to which is a ritzy
ax and I have to get the girls help
because I was like I just that's fine
yeah oh my god it looks like the Gucci
sweater right this is so cute
it's a cropped sweater nice oh you got
me matching pants matching pen she said
they're made big so I had to get them in
this in a small but I have a gift
receipt that's fine and then oh my god I
live for hats like this
yay so I did good yeah you did really
good honestly God you know me so well
exactly we're now oh I love this just
personally my favorite well I think they
look really cute with the shoes oh I
didn't think the sweats would be that
tiny I was telling the girls like my
sister's a really big butt so
make sure it could fit I feel like Kylie
Jenner it's not my style at all
but I really like it I would wear them
separately to separate things but I
think they're so cute I just wouldn't
wear it together okay but I love each
piece individually and I think this
sweater is really nice this offenses are
tight but they don't feel tight you know
like there's there's still comfy is
super comfy and I think cuz they're
high-waisted it would be cute with a
crop top yeah yeah so I give this outfit
and I know ten oh yay with the hat yeah
love I think it looks good though with
it because the sweats are a little tight
so it's not baggy on baggy so it's like
really cute together
