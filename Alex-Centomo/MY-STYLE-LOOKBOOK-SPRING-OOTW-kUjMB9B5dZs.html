hate mondays but I used to always like
them because it's like the start to the
new week you can wear cute outfit keep
it casual and that's exactly what I do
every week this sweater is from H&amp;amp;M I
got a size extra large so it's super
oversized and these shorts are from
redone denim and that's a dog that I got
named boo these are my Doc Martens and
this look together is one of my
favorites I think it's like so edgy but
also really casual uncomfortable and I
really like it a moment Tuesday is
definitely a little bit more out there
so obviously you wouldn't wear this kind
of thing to school but I'm assuming a
lot of you guys are on spring break or
have spring break coming up and are
traveling similar so I thought this
would be a really cute travel outfit
this top which is from revolve pants
were redone and these are super old from
Urban Outfitters and the Hat is lack of
color and I did this really cute
hairstyle which was in my last video if
you guys wanted to see it now on to
Wednesday Wednesday is also super casual
I love vintage so if you watched my
thrift at haul that's what my shirt is
from I'm also wearing my luck c-clip and
extensions and all the looks I get a lot
of questions about my hair in my length
so I do wear the custom length in blonde
balayage and if you guys are curious to
get a pair of your own use the code alex
chin tomo v for money off your first
order I just love the look of extensions
it makes my hair super long and really
full and it's the look that I I go
forward lately shorts are from a gold
and necklaces lumen kala
which is my line and then these are
super dirty I'm kind of embarrassed
about it because I just got them but
they're from dia and I'm obsessed
Thursday is really cute I love this
sweater so much it's from brandy and as
you can see I did another one of my
hairstyles which was in my last video
with the extensions and then these
shorts are from princess Polly I love
the detail on top and they're super
stretchy so like you can definitely size
down in these then wearing these dogs
which are so cool
they give me height and I thought they
really edged out the outfit I'll have
all links to the clothes that I am
wearing in this video listed down below
in the description Friday is another
obviously a crop top that you would not
wear to school but if it's spring break
it's the weekend whatever you can wear
this totally wear it out depending on
the weather so right now in Montreal
it's snowing I'm assuming that's spring
for most of you guys is warmer weather
our spring is just a lot later on in the
year judge these outfits based off of
the weather but I wore this in LA and I
thought it was so comfy and casual and a
lot of people ask me about it top is
revolve jeans are redone and jacket is
free people same thing as for this one a
lot of people ask me about this top and
shorts are from revolve and jacket is
thrifted I also a tried out this new
thing where I put a Lightroom preset on
my video and it makes my skin look a
little weird but I hope you guys enjoyed
it nonetheless some of my favorite
outfits
I'm loving of the vintage trend right
now and anything crop top but I hope you
guys enjoy the video anyways I love you
so much give this video a thumbs up if
you enjoyed it and also subscribe down
below and click the notifications and I
will see you guys all in my next video
