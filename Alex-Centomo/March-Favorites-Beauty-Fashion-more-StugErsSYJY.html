little crazy right now that's because I
literally just filmed my get ready with
me music festival edition if you're
interested in seeing that video I will
have it linked down below but I figured
I would you know film two videos in one
day because it's just easier that way
for me but I figured I would film my
March favorites today oh my gosh I can't
believe March has ended I say this after
every favorites video but it's insane
how fast time just flies yeah I've
actually loved a lot of different things
in the month of March so I figured it
would be good to show you guys so let's
get into it start off with beauty first
my favorite mascara of the month has
been the roller lash mascara that
recently came out from benefit I don't
know why I'm doing this I'm gonna like
throw it at you guys but I love this
mascara just because it adds a lot of
length and not so much volume but
definitely a lot of length which I'm
definitely lacking in and I just really
like it it stays on all day doesn't
smudge works perfectly well for my
lashes my sister loves it too so that's
been a favorite the next has to be this
like cream or body lotion from Bath and
Body Works I've shown this multiple
times on my channel it's actually quite
old this bottle because the packaging
looks different now in Bath and Body
Works but this is from last year beach
glow body lotion and it just adds color
and sparkle to your skin I love using
this after I self tan or in the summer
and since I have since I just got back
from Florida I do have a tan so I've
been using this a bunch and I love it
and as well after my spray tans all last
month I was using this the next thing
I've been using a ton of is the ocean
spray by lush I absolutely love this
stuff ever since I started my channel
you guys know I'm obsessed with the
smell oh my gosh if this could be in a
perfume I would wear it all the time it
smells amazing what I like to do with
this is when my hair is like 80% dry I
spray a little bit in scrunch it up and
it gives you like the best beachy
texture ever I'm
with it this is kind of a random
favorite but since I've been traveling a
lot I don't have a travel sized
toothbrush and I don't know why but I
can't find one anywhere like I've been
all over different drugstores and just
the dollar store and I couldn't find one
but I actually found these like little
brush cases at my local drugstore and
I've been obsessed with it because this
is funny but when I went to LA I like to
wrap my toothbrush in like toilet paper
because I didn't want to get dirty but
then it was like full of toilet paper
which is really gross so this thing is
perfect because it just keeps it locked
up and it doesn't get dirty I'm kind of
like a germaphobe when it comes to my
toothbrushes so that's great
that's it for beauty because I honestly
haven't been wearing too much makeup
this month I've been like on and off
airplanes so why even bother wearing
makeup
this thing has literally saved my life
it is the huge huge it's the hard rock
that I got from the Apple Store I don't
remember the slice that I got but it
fits like so much on here and this has
just been a lifesaver because if you
remember in November I thought I lost
everything on my computer and I freaked
out because I had dropped water on my
computer but I was able to retrieve it
all and ever since that happened I've
been making sure to back up everything
on my hard drive just in case and if you
guys didn't know recently kirino's in
Columbia and your computer just like
stopped working so she lost a bunch of
footage and likes cool nuts and stuff so
there just goes to show you that you
definitely need something like this in
your life doesn't have to be from Apple
you can I'm sure you can find like
really inexpensive ones from like online
or Amazon or whatever it's just that
when that happened to my computer in
November I bought this as soon as I went
to the Apple store because I was like I
just I need something or else I'm gonna
freak out okay now onto like fashion I
guess the first thing has to be this
gray t-shirt here this has it's just a
simple oversized grey t-shirt with a
pocket from daily
this I live in this like I literally
live in this t-shirt it's just a simple
v-neck it's super soft really baggy and
oversized and it just like a perfect fit
on me I got this size medium because I
want it to be extra big and I've been
wearing this on the airplanes I work to
bed it's literally the best thing ever
and it's gray which I'm obsessed so
great things so love this
the next thing has to be this a bikini
or not a bikini bathing suits swimsuit
it's a one-piece it's pink with white
polka dots and it has this like little
mesh detailing on the side which shows
your skin and in the back it's
completely open back and when I got this
my mom was like haha I own something
like that from the 80s or like I own
something like that in the 80s and kind
of made fun of me but I was like and now
I love this and I got so many
compliments on it when I was wearing in
Florida and on my Instagram account you
guys seem to like be obsessed with it
it's so comfortable obviously you
wouldn't tan in something like this
unless you don't care about tanning but
for like a pool party or a beach party
or just like any kind of thing this is
super cute and I wore this like gray
sweater on top of it and it just looked
amazing and this is from Reebok clothing
I will have links down below for you
guys to check out I love it I'm obsessed
with it and it was definitely a splurge
but like I will spend a decent amount of
money on something that I know I'm gonna
be obsessed with like let's say a really
simple white t-shirt I would spend like
more money on that because I know I'm
gonna be like obsessed with it you know
and if it's good quality and it lasts a
long time it's worth it for me then the
last fashion favorite has to be these
shoes these shoes they're just the
all-white vans
I got these last month and I wear them
to the airport this okay I used to wear
my white converse and I just found that
wearing vans to the airport is like the
best thing ever because they're slip-on
so when you're going through security
and you take off your shoes you have to
under your laces every time and this
to my friend a tie when were in Florida
on the way back we were like rushing
through the airport and we had to rush
through security and we were running you
know like in classic in the movies when
you're running through the airport and
when we go out to security I just like
whipped off my shoes put them in the
thing went through but if I was wearing
my converse I would have had to under
the laces so I just think that these are
super practical plus they're super cute
I just love all the weight everything
getting a little scuff marks but
whatever you know I love him they go
with everything now on to random
favorites even though this was kind of a
random favorite whatever I'm all over
the place the next thing we have to be
this book by Ellen DeGeneres it's
seriously I'm kidding I just recently
bought this for the plane ride to LA and
I was laughing non-stop I think it's so
funny I'm like halfway through it but I
know I love reading it when I'm like
traveling places if I'm on the train or
if I'm on a bus or if I want a plane
love writing this just lifts my spirits
and makes me laugh like it's just like
easy to read you know just like one
chapter after the other it's not like a
hard book it's so funny
and then the next favorite of mine has
to be this Polaroid camera I know
everyone has this but I recently got
this thanks to benefit they sent it to
me for a video and I kind of was like oh
cool a Polaroid camera you know but I've
actually been using it so much I keep
buying film at Urban Outfitters film is
so expensive guys why is this film so
expensive like I don't understand but
it's just the Instax Mini 8 it's all
white and I've been taking a ton of
pictures with my sister and Daniel and
just with my friends and stuff I'm
probably gonna bring it to LA for
Coachella I think would be really fun
but at the same time I don't know if I'd
want to be holding this round love you
guys know what you think if you've been
to Coachella before what do you
recommend
should I be bringing a bag or should I
just put everything in a like fanny pack
slash my bra because I don't know if I
want to be holding anything my music
favorite of the month has definitely
kind of been going like this it depends
on my mood which music I listen to but I
have been obsessed with zoella is
Spotify playlist I think it's so much
fun I listen to it like all the time so
if you guys have Spotify check her
playlist out
it's awesome I like listen to it the
first time in the bath and I was just
like dancing along and then like now
everywhere I go if I'm in the car
whenever I just listen to it and it just
makes me super happy so I love that and
now on to my human favorite of the month
I haven't done this in a while but I
recently discovered a youtuber who I've
been watching watching for a few months
now but recently in the month of March
I've been really getting into her
channel she is nothing like what I do at
all like we have nothing in common like
channel wise but I think she's like so
inspiring and so beautiful and her kids
are like the cutest things in the entire
world I love her videos so much and
she's like very consistent and you can
tell she's just
genuinely a good person and just really
likes what she does and she works really
hard and I don't know I just I really
like her so her YouTube name is candid
mommy I will leave her links down below

go tell her that I sent you because that
would be fun if you like like the
Shaytards and like family blogs and just
like that kind of stuff check her out

you know anyways I hope you guys enjoyed
this video I always do weird things to
my arms like what is this I made a goal
of mine to do a monthly favorites like
every month for 2015 so I'm really
sticking to it unless I literally have
no favorites for that month but probably
wouldn't happen because I love so many
things but if you did enjoy this video
