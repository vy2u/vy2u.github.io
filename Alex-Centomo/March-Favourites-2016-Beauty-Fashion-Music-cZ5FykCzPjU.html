channel here I am today on Wednesday I
used to upload twice a week all the time
but lately I've been so busy so I
haven't had a chance to upload on
Wednesdays anymore but I've had some
extra time so I figured why not i miss
you guys so much and i haven't done a
favorites video in a few months and I've
been trying out a ton of different
things loving so many different products
and clothing items and just like now
thats spring I'm starting to experiment
more with different like clothing items
and stuff so I figured I would just sit
down and talk to you guys about some of
my favorites of month of March March is
probably one of my favorite months just
because it's getting close to summer we
have daylight savings so that's a
favorite yeah technically you lose an
hour but the Sun sets way later and then
went to where I live the sun sets at
like 4pm when daylight savings comes
around it sets usually around like seven
thirty so it just gets a lot more Sun
I'm feeling a lot more cheery and happy
the weather is getting warmer so just
all around a good time so I'm going to
start off with beauty products so the
first beauty product I have been a
loving loving for the month of March has
been this this is from these wet CA and
it's called the Hydra force it's like
basically a lip serum / lip balm thing
out of them it's basically a lip balm
but it just really hydrates my lips so
nice and almost gives them like a little
bit of a gloss so it looks really pretty
even when I don't have any color on my
lips and it's so hydrating so I put this
on all the times at night before I go to
bed I wake up my lips are feeling
amazing and soft and luscious and just
real good the texture is really nice if
you don't like having a glossy lip um
and if you are going for that and that
look this is probably not the best thing
to wear underneath that kind of lipstick
but for everyday use and for before you
go to bed this is perfect I really like
it a lot what's the packaging is super
cute along with that same brand is this
face cream and this is called the leaves
wats da hydro okay the glasses are too
far away but I'm gonna put it up on the
screen and you'll be able to see it but
basically this is a really luxurious
cream it feels amazing on my skin it
doesn't break me out it doesn't feel
thick or cakey or anything like that I
love to use this at night before I go to
bed I mix it in with my heels like oil
thing that I bought that I've talked
about many times in my
and I just find it feels so good I wake
up in the morning with such fresh skin
and then along with that like oil I got
the same one but the daytime oil and I
mix this in with my moisturizer for the
daytime which is also the keels one and
this is so nice it feels so good my skin
really needs the extra boost of
nourishment and hydration just because
it is so dry and I used to think it was
just because it's the winter but in all
honesty I think my skin is just dry all
year long so this is such amazing
product it is more on the pricey side
but it's definitely worth the money it
takes oh I mean I've been using this for
two months now and like I've hardly seen
a difference in like it hasn't really
been going down I love it so much and it
smells really good my favorite scent of
the month has been this one this isn't
what the packaging actually looks like
this was just from Sanford and it was
one of the ones I got shipped to me last
month who I need to open this perfume
itself which is almost run out i'm so
sad because i love it this is by clean
and it's white woods it smells so good i
honestly don't know how to explain this
scent all i know is that it smells
freaking amazing and i am obsessed with
it plus these little travel containers
are so cute as well yeah this scent has
been a fav i just realized i didn't talk
about beauty products those were like
skincare and lip care so the first thing
I've to talk about actually if they're
kind of like a two-in-one because I use
them together all the time so the first
is this lip pencil that I get a ton of
questions on like what lipstick i use in
like majority of my videos um yeah so
this combination is what i use on my
lips and wearing it today it's the lip
pencil from charlotte tilbury its iconic
nude is the shade and then over that i
use this lipstick from bike cosmetics
and it's in the shade honeycomb and I've
show this before I think in my makeup
tutorial for Valentine's Day I think
it's such a beautiful shade it looks
really good it looks better in person I
find that on camera like when I watch it
on screen it's not as nice as it is in
person it's so stunning and I get
questions all the time about it now on
to fashion and accessories the first
favorite is not really a favorite of the
month because I literally
Scott it today I add some filming this
but technically it's still March so I
can talk about it it's this hat from
Windsor I'm obsessed with it oh my gosh
how nice is it it's like velvety like
cream color oh my gosh I love it so much
they are so on trend right now with what
their stuff they're coming out with
there's a few other colors but I really
like this one talking about sunglasses I
wore these sunglasses a ton in the month
of March and I get so many questions
about them so they look like this
they're like a mirrored lens type thing
and they're from the brand called alum
looks like this aah LEM I love them so
much these are like the white gold shade
and they sit like this on my face every
time I wear them in vlogs or in snapchat
I get a ton of questions and I really
like them a lot the only thing is
they're extremely expensive so they were
an investment but Windsor has like
almost the exact same pair on their
website so i want to show them to you
guys they look like this they're almost
identical you see that a little
different but still like like a fraction
of the price so if you wanted to like
look into those glasses i would suggest
just getting the winter ones because
they're almost identical and these are
way more affordable than the ones i
purchased I wish I'd have known that
before because I probably would have
just bought these because they look
almost the same although I do have to
say i love the white gold ok clothing
wise i have a sweater which you guys are
definitely gonna recognize if you are
subscribed to me or follow me on any
social media but it's this sweater I've
shown it in my hall it's so cute it's
just a really oversized big adidas
sweater and I am so in love with it I
think it's so cute i got it off the
urban outfitters website and i just love
when sweaters are so soft on the inside
and you can wear them almost like a
sweater dress with booties I think it's
so cute so really happy with this I've
been wearing it a ton i even sleep in it
it's really bad but it's really good
then another clothing item are these
jeans by frame denim I born these so
freaking much because they are this
softest pair of jeans I own they feel
like sweatpants and there
like I'm a mom Jean style so they kind
of go up higher on the waist and then
they're super baggy with like a rip in
the knee and then I roll them a little
bit they are just like so look at this
how is this denim like you can't do this
with denim normally they're so freaking
soft you know they feel like they feel
like redone denim if you guys ever
purchase from redone denim which is like
basically just with vintage jeans that
are redone they feel so soft and that's
what these feel like they feel like
they've been I've had them for years and
oh I just love them and I love the shade
like if you kind of tell them super into
like pastels Gray's neutrals lately for
all of winter i'm always all black but
lately it's been a lot more like lighter
colors and i'm loving it springtime yay
along with the nude colors have been my
favorite shoes of the month which are my
my pride possessions my Yeezys and I've
shown these I forgot which video I
showed these in but I have definitely
showed them before and yes these are
real Yeezys they're not fake I got a few
comments asking if they were real or
fake um I didn't even know they made
fake ones but yeah when I bought them
they're legit they had the real like
certificate in them and the real box
everything that they were very expensive
so just letting you know i got them in a
size a bit too big because i wasn't sure
how the fit was gonna be because my
other adidas shoes that i have like the
stan smith's and like the classic
superstar ones i got them in bigger
sizes because i like like not having
them tight on my feet I kind of like
having that extra room plus it can wear
them with thicker socks and they just
feel so comfortable so I wasn't sure how
if these are going to be made the same
so I got them in the same kind of size
which I'm normally a size seven us woman
but um I got them in a size I think it
was a size 8 for us woman so it's a size
bigger and do the same thing for this
but it actually feels a lot more bigger
which is not the end of the world and i
always think it looks funny when i wear
shoes that are big on me but people tell
me it looks normal because i actually a
really small feet like I'm 58 and a half
or something and I have size 7 feet
which people look at my height and
look at my feet and they're like that
looks weird and a lot of people that are
my height have like way bigger feet so
when I wear shoes that are too big on me
they look almost normal but they're so
comfortable they're so breathable so
amazing if you ever have a chance to
invest in a pair of you zzz I say go for
it because they're amazing I really want
the black ones but I think I'm loving
this more like these are my definitely
my favorite but I do like the black ones
a lot so that is everything like
physical wise and now on to my favorite
song of the month and I don't know why
my sister showed me the song and I've
just been listening to it on repeat it
was actually a remix of Justin Bieber's
love yourself and Selena Gomez hands to
myself which is really cool because it's
like both of them singing together and
like I'm just like oh I love jolina I do
really like them together i hope they
end up together just saying please no
hay to the comments i know a lot of
people get very very strongly
opinionated when it comes to like gilina
but I like them I like ham I like her I
think they're really cute together said
another story so I don't know the drama
but anyways I will link the youtube link
down below where you can actually
download the song it's a little bit more
high-pitched so that you can't like copy
it but there's a download link where you
can download the actual song for free
and I posted on snapchat a few days ago
and a lot of people asked me like who
was the artist and so i'll have that
listed down below as well as links to
everything else i talked about in the
video but definitely check it out if you
like that kind of music then you will
like that I know I just really like the
way it sounds together and I like to run
to it as well so it's just a favorite
and now my human favorite of the month
is my sister Kyla if you guys didn't
know I have a sister Kylie she's been in
many of my videos before and a lot of
you guys seem to love her when she's in
my blogs and stuff and we are actually
going to New York City together which by
the time this video comes up we would
have already gone but we're doing a
little road trip and I'm so excited
because we just get along really well
lately not that we've never not gone
along but there was a time definitely
when we were teenagers and we would just
fight too so much so now we're like best
friends and it's all good and we're
pretty close in age so it's like there's
always a they're used to always be that
like argument back in the day when I was
