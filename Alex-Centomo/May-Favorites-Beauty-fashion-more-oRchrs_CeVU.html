gone time just flies like I say in like
every favorites video now I haven't
tried out a ton of different products
but I definitely have a lot of fashion
favorites for the month of what was it
may oh my gosh it's June Wow and by the
way when you're watching this I will be
in Greece which I'm so excited for so
make sure you're following me on
snapchat to see like what I'm doing
behind the scenes cuz it's gonna be so
much fun I will have all my links listed
down below like I was saying I don't
have that many products but I do have a
lot of fashion favorites so I'm just
gonna roll right into it I guess I'll
start out with beauty I literally have
one Beauty favorite for the month of May
and it is definitely this lip liner I'm
wearing it today but I'm wearing also a
lipstick on top which is tawny pink by
Bobby Brown everyone asked me about the
slip combo so this is the lip liner go
to use and sometimes I just wear the lip
liner on its own it's so nice it's by
Makeup Forever and it's the aqua lip in
3c and it's just like a very like nude
brown color reminds me a lot of Kylie
Jenner that's why I got it I just really
like it a lot so on to skincare I have
one product as well and it is this
product right here this is called the
Olay hendrickson pure truth melting
cleanser three-in-one cleansing gel so
basically i got this so i can bring it
to New York City last month in May
because i needed a makeup remover and a
face cleanser thing um that was under
100 mil so i can bring it on the plane
since I was just bringing carry on so I
went to Sephora and I kind of explained
my skin type and the girls who work at
sephora know who I am so they
recommended this one and I really liked
it and i've been using this instead of
my bow show on both scare but whatever
you know that one that I usually talk
about this I thought I used to talk
about because this just also works as a
cleanser it not only breaks up the
makeup on your face but it helps cleanse
your face so what I'll do is I'll
usually rub this all over I'll let it
set you guys have to let it sit so it
can soak in and kind of break up all of
the makeup on your face especially like
your mascara or whatever and then after
around maybe a minute I wash off with
water and then I'll usually add a little
bit more over my
eyelashes cuz I'm very OCD with my
mascara and I need to have it like all
off or else it really bothers me and
then I kind of just going all over just
one little bit and it cleanses my face
you need like the smallest amount it's a
gel consistency doesn't really smell
like anything like it doesn't have a
scent to it but I really really like
this and if you have dry skin like I do
you would like this because it does add
a little bit of coil but not oil in a
bad way like moisture and it kind of
just rehydrates your skin and I really
like it the next two things are hair
products and they were sent to me by
living proof a while ago and I just
decided to try them out in May and I'm
absolutely obsessed so the first one is
the living proof perfect hair day
nightcap and so what I do with this is I
um if I take a shower at night when my
hair is like almost completely dry like
ninety percent dry I will run this
through everywhere like i'll start with
my roots and I'll concentrate more at
the ends obviously because they're more
dead but i'll run it everywhere then i
sleep on it and the next morning my hair
is like super shiny super soft I'll
rinse it out obviously and it's just it
like makes my hair look so healthy i got
a lot of compliments on it it lasts for
like five shampoos and you guys know i
wash my hair like twice a week sometimes
once a week so this lasts a long time
and it's a pretty big bottle and then
the next thing is my living proof as
well and it's called the style extender
and this is basically a primer that you
use before you style your hair but what
i really like about this is that it
doesn't add any extra oil it actually
takes away Doyle so what I do with this
is even if I'm not styling my hair when
my hair is almost completely dry I won't
use this the same time I use this
obviously but i'll put it like near my
roots and then concentrate throughout
the rest of my hair and ensures that
your hair doesn't get as greasy as it
could its really really weird i don't
know how it works but i can go like five
days without washing my hair and and i
work out like every single day and it
doesn't look that greasy and i honestly
think it has to do with this now on to
fashion favorites if you guys follow me
on snapchat or Instagram
you will recognize these sweatpants here
there's simple sweatpants that are from
Urban Outfitters they are the thinnest
softest material in the entire world I'm
actually obsessed with them they're so
simple but I wear them almost every
single day and I actually just took them
out of my dirty hamper because they they
are dirty and I need to wash them but
they're so soft and comfortable and I do
recommend if you have an urban
outfitters next to go try them on
because you're gonna be hooked the next
thing that I've really been into in the
month of May which is kind of a trend
and it's not a huge thing with everyone
but for me it definitely is and they are
denim skirts I just a big fan of denim
skirts i find denim skirts with a really
oversized t-shirt on top is so cute
together like I'll tuck the t-shirt in
and this is by paige denim but i got it
at revolve calm and it's just a light or
medium wash um skirt and it has a little
rip on the bottom and then a little rip
on the pocket and it's very simple I
where the more low down like you're not
high waisted um and I just really think
they're super cute and paige denim is
like the most comfortable denim I've
ever felt in my entire life it's like
feels like leggings almost like it's
crazy the next trend which again is on a
huge trend with everyone but for me I'm
definitely fun of it are these like
little head scarf things now this one's
from revolve as well but it's by the
brand Eugenia Kim and you basically just
wear on your head like this this one
looks like you tied it like it's already
kind of pre done but I think these looks
super cool I'm actually obsessed with
them and I own a bunch of like headbands
and a bunch of these and scarves and
stuff and I'm just going to be rocking
it out in Greece I already know and then
the last clothing item that I have are
these pants
who do i post a picture on Instagram
wearing these and everyone freaked out
about them they're from Windsor and I'm
literally in love there are the most
comfortable pants ever but they look
like nice they look like you could wear
them out for dinner you can heels to
them and make them dressing you could
just wear them sandals and make them
casual they're super comfortable I wear
them high-waisted and then they don't go
all the way down to my ankles they're
kind of like mid ankle or mid calf but
they're a bit loose on top I don't know
they're super nice they have pockets
right in the front and I really like
these a lot and i actually just lounge
around in them all day to like they're
really comfortable I have two shoes that
I've been obsessed with if you follow me
on snapchat and everything you will
recognize these babies because I'm
literally obsessed they're from Isabelle
maram they're simple like I want to say
kind of like Birkenstocks because your
foot like forms to the sandal but
they're so comfy I wear these like every
single day if it's not raining I wear
them and then another trend that has
been going around lately that I'm
actually super down for our sneaker kind
of sneaker running shoes with like a
cute outfit like ripped jeans and a nice
loose tea so these are my favorite
sneakers they're from sam edelman the
circus collection and i think they're
super cute because i love the colors of
them they're very simple super
lightweight and very comfortable like
they're very flimsy and stuff so they
don't hurt you can walk a long time in
them
and your fuel get blisters I just really
like them plus they just go with a lot
of outfits and then I have to jewelry
items for you guys so they are both by
Melanie Audrey bracelets if you guys
don't know my friend Mel creates or
doesn't create but she makes these
bracelets her brand is called Melanie
Audrey and they're inspired by you know
people around the world and travel and
all that kind of stuff you know that I'm
super into traveling basically um the
bracelet that I really want to talk
about were part of her baldy collection
and if you guys didn't know um when I
went to Florida was doing a shoot from
LA Audrey and we took pictures in these
bracelets and stuff but this is what
they look like my favorites are actually
the mint and the purple but she gave me
the mint and the blue these ones are
still really nice but I have a special
place for purple in my heart but this
this color is literally my favorite
thing in the entire world his bracelets
are the from the Bali collection when
she went to Bali she got very inspired
and made these bracelets and I have been
obsessed with them ever since and I've

recently gave me and I was so excited to
bring them with me for Greece are the

specifically for me because I told her
to also can you make it stack inspired
by Greece because i'm going there so she
did and so it's these colors they're so
