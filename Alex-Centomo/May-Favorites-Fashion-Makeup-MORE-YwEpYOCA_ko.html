with my may favorites this has been such
a requested video I think I did like one
favorites video a long time ago I don't
even remember one but I think it's a
good time to do it because I have tried
out so many different things in the
month of May and I just figured that I
would share with you guys because I know
I get so many questions on my Instagram
and stuff and I just figured that I
would just do this video let's just get
into it okay so starting off I guess
with like fashion um oh this hat this
hat is from pink ice just looks like
this like a little top hat I really like
it it's like circular and it's also kind
of circular on top I think it's really
cool really neat and it's different i
usually have like floppy black hats or
like tan hats and this is something of a
difference so i just really like it i've
been wearing it a ton in the month of
May um this necklace is actually from
Natalie be jewelry I just really really
really like choker necklaces um I know
it's a huge trend right now but any
necklaces that are kind of like high up
I've always really enjoyed and this
one's just really neat because it's kind
of like got that bohemian look to it and
I just really like it everything that I
say in this video will be linked down
below for you guys you want to go check
out the website so moving on to clothing
first thing overalls so these like
overall shorts they're shorts not like
the long overalls I wear these overalls
in a video last summer and a lot of
people were like what are you doing cuz
like it wasn't so much a trend then as
it is now but um I don't know I just
been wearing them a ton this month for
some reason it's been getting hotter
where I live so you know thank you
weather for being nice outside for once
and even though it's raining today I got
these at Urban Outfitters but they're
kind of like vintage so I don't really
know if you can find like these exact
ones but it was like around the time
last summer where urban was sent selling
like all of their like overalls and I
like them cuz they're like kind of like
acid wash and also they're very loose
and baggy on me so that's something that
I like when it comes to overalls so in
the month of may I have been wearing
this top so many times this is on the
one from nasty gal it just like goes up
like this and then it kind of like cuts
like that on the side I don't know it's
like this its crop I know brandy
melville has like this exact one in
black and white but I just like this one
from nasty gal because the material is
like very stretchy and like kind of
thick and I just really like the color
of its navy blue I like actually wearing
it with this necklace it's really cool
and then also with this shirt I paired
it with this kimono that i got from pink
ice as well at the same place I got this
hat it's just an online stores really
cool i like all their stuff a lot it's
kind of like a crochet kind of material
it goes pretty long and I just really
like the ends because they have like
these tassels on them and their short
sleeves it's just very like very
bohemian and oh this is cute but yeah
we're like this kimono with that shirt
and this necklace I maybe even this hot
I don't know depends on depending on how
I felt that day so the next thing is
this top from hunted dreams hunted
dreams is an Australian website and sure
talked about before I just really like
this stuff from there honestly so
obsessed with australian fashion right
now but this top whoa it's a crop
crochet top but it goes off the
shoulders so it's like this on your body
and your arms just go through these
little things here oh i don't know i
mean i have so many pictures on
instagram if you guys are curious as to
how i style these outfits just go check
out my instagram because i have so many
pictures posted wearing all of these
things so this top is like so nice and
it's actually really area so it's
perfect in the summer and i wear this
with so many different things actually
wear this with the overalls at work the
other day and everyone was like hey I
would have never thought to put those
two together but that looks really nice
on you so I think I'm gonna do that now
and I was just like trendsetter not
really so the last clothing item that I
have are these boyfriend jean shorts
these are just like really bad you loose
cut out boyfriend jean shorts they're
from free people I just really like them
they're very like rugged looking and
they're very loose on me
and I sometimes feel like I need to wear
them with a belt but I kind of like that
look where it's like kind of hanging off
of your hips it's really nice makes your
legs look super skinny because they're
really Peggy which is always a plus
that's about it for clothing but then I
do have these shoes I've been wearing
like all the freaking time these are my
new high-top all black converse um I got
these not too long ago and I've been
wearing love I think I wore them every
single day the month of May they're just
so comfortable and so nice i just really
like them to go with everything so it's
not hard to style i got this like here
let me show you this like hand bracelet
thingy that goes on your finger this is
from china or jewelry or shin or i don't
really know how to explain it but it's
my new favorite website of buying
jewelry all of their stuff is like very
bohemian and it's all handmade and
unique from Turkey um I just really like
it and this actually in the month of May
a couple times a word on my foot as I
can anklet and hangs you put on your toe
and then this part hangs on your foot
it's so pretty and I just picture myself
wearing this on the beach I just really
really really like it so I will
definitely like their website down below
check it out because it's my new
favorite website to buy jewelry it's so
nice everything from there is so you
need and then of course the last thing
I've been wearing a ton in the month of
May is this bracelet and this bracelet
is by Melanie Audrey it's one of my good
friends I started a jewelry company I
think I mentioned this in one of my
other videos but just in case you guys
are new and you don't know she makes
bracelets and every single bracelet is
based off of somebody and they'll
they'll tell a story and it's all alike
it's just really cool i will link her
website down below but this one is like
the mermaid bracelet or something i
don't know she she named this one after
me and she knows that I like love these
colors like the turquoise in the green
and very earthy and I've been wearing
this like a ton in the month of may I
just really like it I'm probably be
wearing this all summer because it's
like this is basically me and a bracelet
just saying like these are my favorite
colors it's like my favorite thing
because it's like I don't know if you
guys want me in a bracelet go check it
out
sometimes I talking him like what what
ok on to beauty next would have to be
this st. Tropez tanning bronzing lotion
my apologies this bronzing lotion um
since I do live in Canada um it's not
the nicest throughout the winter and I
want to get like a start on my time
before the summer began because I just
had so many picture ideas so I want to
do outside but I was just pale as a
ghost because i lost my time completely
from Mexico so I went to Sephora and i
purchased the same shall pay i used to
use the like white bottle one like the
mousse but the girl actually recommended
the black one because not only is it
darker which is kind of what I wanted
but it's more of like a green undertone
not so much an orange undertone so it
gives you a really nice natural tan and
I use this probably like once every two
weeks because it it lasts really long on
me if you're interested in seeing kind
of like how to use this let me know I'll
probably make a tutorial on how to use
this stuff because I feel like a lot of
people don't know how to use tanning
lotion properly so let me know in the
comments if you want to see how I apply
this stuff it's really good i like it
and also smells a lot better than the
original ok the next beauty favorite i
have is this mascara this is the what is
this the tart lights camera splashes
waterproof mascara i pick this up at the
beginning of the month of May and I've
used it every single day since it is
definitely the best mascara every use in
my life I have kind of like short
eyelashes and they're pretty light
because I have naturally light hair so
this one is just like super nice the one
is pretty big I just really like it I
love the packaging it's purple and
pretty and it makes my eyelashes like
super volumize and really like thick I'm
wearing it today don't know if you can
tell since it's waterproof it doesn't
smudge which is a huge thing for me
because I have smaller eyes so when I
blink my eye masks are usually smudges
so I do need to use waterproof one and
this one has just been my all-time
favorite one for this month then I got
this lip liner this is from make up
forever and it is the colour 15c aqua
lip um oh that needs to be sharpened but
this is the color
I just wanted to sephora one day and I
showed a picture of kylie jenner and i
was like he make my lips look like this
please and the girl was like okay and
she showed me all these different
techniques and stuff that the Jenners
use and I was ok well I definitely don't
have enough money to buy like five
products so i'll buy one and this is
like the main lip liner that she uses
she'll also use like a nude lipstick on
top of this which I own nude lipstick so
I didn't need to purchase that and then
she'll also use like a brown kind of
nude color for the outline of her lips
to make her lip some more look more
plump and then she kind of blends that
out and it's like all these products put
together to make her lips look so
amazing and I was like well you know
what I'm just gonna buy this because I
just relate the color it looks really
nice with my green eyes and I've been
wearing at a ton so if you want your
lips to look like Kylie Jenner now on to
random favorites this month of course I
have to talk about my favorite book oh
I'm sure you guys all know but this is
the fault in our stars is probably like
like the saddest book I've ever read in
my life it's so good i love John Breen
fellow youtuber he writes amazing books
they're really easy to read I read this
in like a day um but i just read really
fast as well but oh my gosh i couldn't
put it down I was literally bawling by
the end I just so I'm gonna be a mess
when the movie comes out the movie comes
out on me my boyfriend's anniversary so
I think we're going to go see that and
he's gonna be like why are you bringing
me to this like I'm just gonna be there
like crying like crazy but um if you
know what it is it's about a girl that
has cancer and I will link the preview
down below to the movie um shailene
woodley stars in the movie and I just
really like her his actress so I'm
really excited to see this movie a lot
and yeah let me know if you guys have
read it and what you think the movies
gonna be like I hope they do a good job
because the book is just amazing the
next random favorite i have is Frank
baud um this is like a coffee scrub for
your body I was contacted by the company
to do a review on my Instagram and they
were nice enough to send me a little
sample or whatever I actually used it
before because my friend had given me a
little sample and it was amazing so when
they contact me I was just like you
yes yes plz plz plz plz like I'm so
excited basically I use this every time
I'm going to self tan so this is what i
use to exfoliate and not only does it
just exfoliate your body but it's filled
with stuff that are so good for your
skin it hack actually helps clear up any
kind of like stretch marks or
discoloration you have on your body a
lot of the stretch marks around like the
fives in the bum area like if you use
this regularly it will clear it up I do
not recommend using this every single
day that probably is not good for your
skin but maybe like once or twice a week
is really good it smells amazing it's
like the mixture with like the vanilla
coconut and the coffee is just really
nice um I just really like it i like
getting dirty with Frank this is not a
sponsored video guys I'm telling you
like I actually use this a lot this is
just the other package I have but it's
it's really good i really like it i
would never put something in a video or
in a picture that i do not one hundred
percent believe in because i am letting
you guys know now I'm contacted by a lot
of companies to do cup collaborations
with them but I only go I only really
respond and work with the companies that
I truly believe I like their products
because I never want to like promote
stuff that I just would never use myself
because like what's the point of that
it's not it's not fun and um anyways
this is just like this stuff is just
amazing i do really recommend this i
know a lot of my friends have purchases
before and they love it so just saying
the last favorite this month has been my
skinny meaty this is kind of like a tea
talks cleanse um I've never fully done
at e talks cleanse before I hear all
about it through Instagram and Tumblr
and stuff but um I was never really
interested in trying it just because I
felt like I just didn't need to do it
but then I was like you know what I had
a friend that was doing it outside I
want to give it a try um I didn't do it
fully like just doing like the complete
cleanse I decided on the skinny me t
because um I actually see a lot about
this company on tumblr and I was like
I'll give it a try so in the package
came three different types of tea and
they all help in a different area so
like this one is just to help with
toning this is
help with bring fat and then this one is
the tea talks so there are different
ones this is like a 14-day detox cleanse
I honestly really like it I work out
regularly and I eat on a fairly healthy
diet so I don't um I don't want to see
anything dramatically change in my life
I just want a more feel better inside
just cuz I feel like there's been a lot
of like gunk building up lately and I
think that's just because like from the
past of like eating crappy food or like
every time I go to the movies i need
like junk food or something i need to
kind of like start somewhere and get
motivated with doing something every
single day so i figured that i would try
this out and i actually really like the
taste of the t's i'm a huge tea drinker
i love just like plain green tea and
stuff like that so this is actually
really good sometimes i'll add some
lemon or some honey to give it some
extra flavor but that's about it and if
you're interested in seeing a video all
about this kind of stuff let me know in
the comments because i could do like a
whole video surrounding like what I do
like how I drink it and what I do every
single day and like a diet thing I'm
already working on a workout routine but
if you want to see kind of like my diet
or like her what I ate today kind of
video let me know because I feel like
that would be kind of interesting but I
don't know if you guys would want to see
that anyways that's about it for my
favorites this month I hope you guys
enjoy this video let me know if you want
to see more favorite videos I feel like
there was a lot this month just because
I haven't done a favorites video in so
