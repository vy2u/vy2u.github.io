filming my mermaids hair tutorial so
many of you guys requested this after I
made my video like my back-to-school
outfits ideas video and also my boho
inspired lookbook I did my hair a
certain way in both of those videos and
I got an overwhelming amount of
questions on how I did that hairstyle
and also on my Instagram I had been
posting a lot of pictures with my hair
curl dessert a certain way so I figured
that what better way to show you the in
video I honestly don't know why you guys
like my hair tutorials so much because I
feel like I'm so bad at doing hair but a
lot of you seem to think I'm good so I
guess that's a compliment so thank you
very much for that cuz I do love doing
hair I just never thought I was that
great at it so I guess it's a good thing
that you guys like it
starting off of course with my heat
protectant spray this is the Tresemme
keratin smooth one I just spray this in
my ends and then combing out starting
from the bottom working my way up and
also what I find sometimes I like to
spray this in my hand and then rub it
through my ends just because it like
places the product better than just
spraying it so sometimes I do that just
because my ends are very dead I don't
want to damage them more also let me
know in the comments if these kind of
videos are getting kind of repetitive
for you I'm just literally doing what
you guys suggest so if you want hair
tutorials I will do more hair to hair
tutorials for you guys um there isn't
like much difference to them but I do
love doing hair so if you have any
suggestions or like you see a picture on
tumblr or something that you really want
me to recreate then like send me links
on Twitter I'll link my Twitter down
below because I love looking at pictures
you guys send me and getting inspiration
for them I really like it this hairstyle
actually calls for splitting your hair
down the middle
I don't like parts that are like
perfectly perfectly centered I kind of
just take my finger go like this and
then just spread it out like that
because I like the Messier kind of look
to it and then I'm using my Conair I
think this is 1 and 3/4
inch curling wand the reason why I use
this one is because it has a clamp and
you need a clamp for this kind of look
so if you have any curling wand that has
a clamp you're set to go
the smaller the barrel the Tertre
Victoria the smaller the barrel the
tighter the curl will be so I tried
getting like the biggest wand I could
and I think this is either the two inch
or the one and three-quarter inch I
don't remember which one I purchased but
I just got it from the drugstore it was
really inexpensive and I find it works
perfectly well for my hair so this look
is actually really simple and I actually
found this look from Barefoot blonde if
you guys don't know who she is she's a
really awesome and talented blogger um I
love her blog I always look at her
pictures I think she's so beautiful she
gets me she gives me a lot of
inspiration for my like fishtail braids
so if you guys are interested in like
how I like to recreate my braids check
out her blog because she's awesome
I will link her blog down below as well
as her YouTube channel because I
actually got this tutorial from her like
this is how I started doing my hair I do
do it a bit differently because I kind
of put my own spin on it
but she just has amazing amazingly
gorgeous hair and her family is so
good-looking and her baby is so adorable
anyways yeah just go check her out and
tell her I sent you because I'd be
pretty awesome cuz I love her so
basically all you do or all she did and
what I like to do too is you take a
section of hair so I'll start with my
bangs cuz that's easiest for you guys to
see because it's right in front and then
you curl I like to do the sections
closest to my face away from my face so
I curl around once twice and then I hold
it there until it's like it's curls so
probably like three seconds is good and
then I let it fall and you have this
little curl but see how the end is
straight and then I take the section
that hasn't been curled yet and what I
do is where the curl like I like to
continue the curl so I'll do the clamp
I'll hold it down one two three take it
off and then I'll go a bit more down and
I switch the clap opposite way and I
hold down one two three and then I lift
it off and see how it's kind of like
going up and then I go this way one two
three and then last one one two three
and then you're left with this like
crimpy kind of wave thing so you have a
curl on the top and then you have a wave
at the bottom and this just actually
makes beautiful beach curls they're so
nice I don't know how she ever came up
with this look but I think it's
stunningly beautiful and then especially
at the end when you add in sea salt
spray it's awesome that's basically what
I do to my whole head I'm not even
kidding you so I'll start with my next
section you're on once twice
I go around twice for my shorter
sections and then my longer sections
I'll go around maybe three or four times
and then I crimp the bottom one
go down
and you do need a clap for this look
because the clap ensures that it's
holding down the pieces and I find for
this look and she said this in her
tutorial as well but the cheaper the
wand the better see look at that how
cool is that the cheaper wands the
clumps aren't that tight so by like
putting it down like this is not going
to create a crease mark because you know
all the times you get those crease marks
in your head I don't really like that
look so fact that she used a cheaper
wand for this is perfect this is a
longer section now I twirled it around
three times and I don't worry too much
about how I tell twirl the piece of hair
around the barrel I kind of just like do
whatever this does kind of take a while
it's not quick but I swear it's like my
favorite way to curl my hair right now
and then the last piece the end since
they're pretty dead I hold it for three
seconds and I let go so this is what the
hair looks like when it's completely
done because I did this whole side see
how it's kind of curled on the top and
then it goes more way being crimped at
the bottom if you guys wanted to use a
crimper I know those things exist but I
like the whole point of having a bit of
a curl on top and then more of a wave on
bottom it literally looks like mermaid
hair so this is the undone side and this
is the done side and you can have your
part anywhere you anywhere you like it I
just like having my part in the middle
just because I like that boho look but
you can have the part wherever so I'm
just going to go ahead and curl the rest
of my hair and I'll be right back once
you're done curling it should look like
this it's really cool it's got like the
nice curl on top and the nice crimp on
the bottom like this so many of you guys
wanted me to do this hairstyle because
you've seen it in my videos and then
what I like to do after I'm done curling
is I kind of just like run my fingers
through my hair like this and I don't
want to completely mess up the curl
because I like that kind of tight look
you can kind of separate a little bit
with your fingers and then of course I
go in with my sea salt spray because
it's my obsession spray it a bit at the
ends scrunch it up it just adds in some
texture and this sea salt spray is my
favorite because it smells so good so
that's essentially what
do for my hair this is it up close the
bottom like this and that's about it so
this tutorial actually it's not very
quick it does take me around 15 10 to 15
minutes to do it but I really like doing
this for when I'm going out or I have an
event because I just really like it or
for photoshoots of course it's my
favorite thing to do for my hair if you
