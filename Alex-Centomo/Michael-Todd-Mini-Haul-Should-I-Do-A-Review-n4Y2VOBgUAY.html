today I'm on the way to my boyfriend's
house and I'm in the car so sorry if
this is kind of shaky but it is Michael
Todd true organics it's a skincare line
that's pretty cool so these are the
products that I received this one is a
charcoal detox deep pore gel cleanser
and it says that it see this focus okay
gently removes dirt oil makeup and
impurities because you know we all got
those impurities and it does that
without residue or irritation it's for
acne prone and oily skin which I kind of
have combination to oily skin it's not
totally oily but I'm guessing this will
help because I do get acne once in a
while I have pimples and all that stuff
so yeah I guess this is um like a
cleanser so I'm excited to try that out
and then I got it and what is this one
this is a moisturizer and it is non oil
hydrating lotion so I'm guess I'm
guessing this is a daily moisturizer
because it says that it controls oil and
shine and it won't clog pores sorry it's
kind of like shiny I didn't take the
wrapper off yet so that's a moisturizer
and then this one is what does it say a
blue-green algae antibacterial toner
okay so this is kind of like Bioderma so
it's a toner you put it on after you
would either remove your makeup or wash
your face and it's supposed to just help
you pull the oil on your face and it is
moisturizing and all that stuff so that
is that the last thing okay so this one
is the charcoal detoxifying facial mask
ooh that sounds really cool I love
putting on face masks and I think I look
extra sexy with them on my face right
Dino
so this one is extra absorbent and
moisturizing and it's for normal to dry
mature and sensitive skin which is
completely different than the other
products that I got but I mean it's
never too early to start with any anti
wrinkle cream or any stuff like that and
so yeah I'm excited to try this out let
me know if you're interested in seeing
kind of a follow up video if I like the
products or not if I recommend them and
stuff like that um I heard Michael
Todd's a really good line so I'm excited
to try this stuff out and hopefully it
works by the way have you guys ever
thought this looked like cheetos my
boyfriend said that today and i was like
oh my god that's so true he told me that
if i were to paint them orange and then
give them to someone that i could trick
them into eating it should i do that
mm-hm would you do that April Fool I
hope you guys are having a wonderful day
and I will see you all soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
