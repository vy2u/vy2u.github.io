video I apologize I've been gone for so
long it feels like forever since I've
actually just sat down and talked to you
guys the last video I put out was kind
of just like a summer outfit of the day
so there was no talking and I don't know
I miss you guys I miss your comments and
your inboxes and all your questions I've
just been super busy with work but now I
am planning to get back on track and
start making videos more often I have a
couple of ideas coming up um so yeah
it's a beautiful day decide to take
advantage and make a video today it's
going to be a mini haul video I went
shopping recently and picked up a few
goodies and thought it would be a good
idea to show you what I got so I went
shopping recently and I picked up a few
things that I thought you guys might be
interested in seeing the first place I
went to was lush and it is one of my
favorite stores I went in specifically
to get this greased lightening acne spot
treatment and I've heard a lot of good
things about it
I used to use the clean and clear one
but it wasn't that great so I decided to
pick this up and honestly it's amazing I
know I say that all the time in every
video but like this thing is great I use
it before I go to bed at night after I
wash my face I just put a little bit on
is it or pimple or whatever and the next
day it's either gone or there's a huge
difference in redness and appearance so
that is great I love it and also smells
really good I don't know it's a very
minty very strong I like it so as soon
as my sister in the background but I
totally got sucked into getting the
beach box from lush I don't know why I'm
like a really a sucker when it comes to
anything to do with the ocean or sea
salt or seaweed or anything like that
and what are you doing she's doing a
video man
so they show me this is their summer
collection and it comes with a few
sample size products just a test out
which I thought was really cool so the
first thing that they give you is this
shampoo bar smells really freaking
amazing there's like seaweed and sea
salt and a bunch of stuff in here and
this is actually very strange I when I
first saw this it's just like how am I
supposed to use this with this shampoo
bar you wet your hair and then you kind
of just rub it in your hands and then
rub it into your hair and it lathers up
really nicely and it gives a really nice
cleanse cleansing anyways it just
cleanses your hair really well I love
the smell of it it's supposed to last
you around 30 washes and this was just a
sample size so like for a full month and
a half this is gonna do me great the
next thing that comes in is this ocean
salt exfoliator
and this stuff smells amazing again mmm
as you can see it's like blue with sea
salt and here let me read what's in it
sea salt scrub with organic lime to
brighten and avocado to soften which my
avocados sea salt it's like the perfect
mixture what do you do okay it's the
perfect combination so it's really good
at exfoliating and then it leaves your
skin really nice and smooth and soft I
just love it so much
so yeah I used it only twice as you can
see and so far I mean you noticed a huge
difference I use it before I shave my
legs it's really hot outside and it's
bright so I'm just gonna excuse me put
my sunglasses on so you guys don't have
to see me squinting so the next thing
that comes in at the beach box is this
again like little sea salt sea lotion
and this stuff smells really good
again smells like the sea kind of
and you put it on when you're still in
the shower right before you get out and
it's kind of like a conditioner for your
skin so you just rub it all over your
body and then you rinse it off and pat
pat your skin to dry and afterwards your
skin seriously feels like a baby's butt
it's so soft yeah I love it okay so the
next thing that comes in the beach box
is this soap which I don't know what
it's called because I forget and there's
it's not written anywhere oh wait maybe
it is nope
anyways it's just like a sea salt soap I
haven't used it yet it smells like the
ocean I smelled it when I was in lush
there's a bunch of sea salt and seaweed
and organic avocado and coconut coconut
oil and stuff like that all in this bar
and I'm so excited to try this out
smells really good I love it and then
the last thing that comes in the beach
box which is my absolute favorite thing
ever is this sea salt spray now this
stuff smells incredible like oh my god
it smells that's like my favorite scent
in the whole wide world it's like eh
mixed with something sweet
I usually just spray this in my hair
when it's like 75% dry and I scrunch it
up and this is how I get these like kind
of beachy waves and it leaves your hair
smelling amazing all day I love it so
much it's like my favorite thing ever
and I wish they came out with a perfume
that smell
I wish they came out with a perfume that
smells like this because it just smells
amazing
also from lush I decided to pick up a
sample of the argument the rose argan
body butter or body lotion oh that
really smells like roses I've heard a
lot of great things about it again it's
like another conditioner you put on your
skin before you get out the shower and
it's made with 75 rose petals and I'm
really excited to use it cuz I love the
scent of rose and it just smells really
great so yeah and then the last thing
that I got was this $5 cream and 100% of
the proceeds go towards the charities at
lush supports so this one is going
towards the New Hampshire animal rights
league it's committed to ending fur
trapping in New Hampshire and the
suffering of all animals which I thought
was a great cause and this smells like
mint and chocolate which is really good
and the cream is also very moisturizing
so that's why I got this only five bucks
then I slept over at Mac and I just got
two things that I was really wanting for
a long time besides just to suck it up
and get it it's another one of the pro
longwear concealer the other one that I
had rope I decided just to get this one
it matches my skin for this summer but I
did go a shade down just in case I
decide to use this during the fall
because my tan does last kind of a long
time and I also want to start using self
time but I'm not very good at it so as
soon as I figure out how to do that I
will make sure to do a tutorial on how
to use self tan
I apologize for my crazy sister the next
thing I got was this blush by Mac called
prism and it looks like this it's my
all-time favorite blush it's really
natural it just gives your skin really
nice like dark nude kind of look and I
just love it I'm wearing it today and
it's amazing and then the last thing I
picked up not from Mac but I just put in
my Mac buying was the misty or smells
amazing this is my summer scent and I
love it yeah that's about it so I hope
