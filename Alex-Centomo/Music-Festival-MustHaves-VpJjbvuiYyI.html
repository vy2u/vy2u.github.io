channel as you guys may or may not know
festival season is right around the
corner which means one I'm so stoked to
get to dress up in bohemian clothing and
it's totally acceptable because where
I'm from if you dress like that it's
just kind of strange and three you get
to listen to some of the most amazing
music live and I just love festival
season so much so I decide to sit down
and film some of my festival must-haves
so things that I think are probably the
best thing to wear to a festival or
bring to a festival or things I just
really think that you should have one
going to a music festival and the reason
why I'm saying music festival starts now
is because I just kind of base it off of
Coachella
because once Coachella starts then
everything else kind of follows and yeah
so let's just hop right into it so the
first thing I want to talk about our
body tattoos these are probably my
number one like requirement for music
festivals these are so popular these are
by the brand kiss they're temporary body
tattoos they're gold silver black
there's a lot of different colors like
this and they're so pretty in one
package you actually get three sheets of
tattoos and it shows on the back some
really really cool designs and stuff and
there's also a picture of a girl on it
wearing the tattoos I wore these all the
time last year for literally every
festival even in the summer sometimes I
just thought they were so cute
they're just nice when it's sunny out
unlike today pouring rain thanks and I
just love the fact that they're metallic
because it just looks really good in
like the Sun when you go through the
light they shine and it looks so pretty
in pictures and videos what I like about
these is that they're really easy
step-by-step application process and
it's also hassle free removal process
which is great because there's nothing
worse than like having a temporary
tattoo and you like cannot get it off
for the life of you that's happened
these are super simple to apply and
remove to apply all you have to do is
you cut out the tattoo of your choice
then you remove the clear sheet and you
place the tattoo face down onto your
skin you can put it anywhere you want on
your body your arm your neck and then
you're going to
the tattoo thoroughly with a sponge or a
wet cloth you want to make sure that it
gets really wet and then you're going to
wait 20 seconds and then you're going to
gently remove the back paper and then
you're going to allow the tattoo to dry
as you can see they're super easy to put
on your skin they look amazing and I'm
just so excited to rock these when I'm
at Coachella definitely check these out
I'll have the link listed down below in
description for you this one has blue on
it oh my gosh this is so nice I'm
totally gonna put this one around my
neck oh yes the next must-have I want to
talk about these are by the brand
impress I am PR ESS and these are so
simple to use they stay on for so long
and they have such cute colors so I
think for me I'm gonna go with the white
ones for Coachella and then they also
have this little one that says love on
it and I might put that on my ring
finger and then there's also sparkly
ones so there's so many different colors
to choose from I have also turquoise I
have a peach one and then there's also
mu this one's so nice it's like a violet
color that's so pretty with a tan and
then there's this really fun yellow one
as well which is like super super bright
so basically I just really like them
because it gives you like a salon
perfect manicure in just minutes you
don't have to go to the salon and get
them done yeah and like what I was
saying before would they like ultra hold
adhesive technologies that there's no
glue required that just means there's
like no mess there's no hassle there's
no waiting time for the glue to dry just
super easy to just stick on to your
nails that's it and your nails don't get
damaged after which is amazing I'm
waiting to apply them for when I
actually go to LA and I think they're
gonna look so pretty
they're also super super easy to remove
when you're applying these you just want
to select the correct size nail for each
finger and set aside in order you also
want to make sure that you're not
wearing any nail polish and your nails
are clean from any kind of oil or
product or anything like that so just
kind of like wipe them down I typically
use the smaller sizes just because I
have kind of small nails and I don't
like one like the nail kind of goes over
the nail but if that makes any sense and
then you're going to peel off the
backing of the nail to be applied then
you're going to align the nail with the
cuticle
and so the tab lines along with the
cuticle then you're going to press down
the nails firmly and that just ensures
that you have a long lasting result and
a big tip here is to always apply thumbs
last because it gets really hard to
press down and stuff when you have your
thumbs already done even when I paint my
nails like back in the day I would
always do my thumbs last you're going to
want to continue pressing on nails for a
first half hour to ensure the extended
wear and then you're going to just avoid
water or filing or cutting for the first
hour that way just make sure that the
nails stay on for a very long time and
it's just so fast and easy to do let me
know in the comments down below what
color you want me to do and if you want
me to vlog it when I do do it huh when I
do do it yeah I'm I can't decide between
the white with a silver Sparkle or the
violet colors so let me know don't
forget to check out the link down below
in the description if you would like to
check out the products I'm super excited
about them and I just think they're so
simple inexpensive easy to use and
perfect for music festivals now on to
more clothing items the first thing I
want to talk about are hats and I think
hats are so important when it comes to
music festival one they protect your
face from the Sun which by the way
should always wear sunscreen I'm just
saying but yeah they protect your face
from the Sun but they also look so super
cute so there are two that I have in
mind that I think are perfect for music
festivals coming down below how many
times I've said music festivals I just
like to repeat myself baseball caps are
like perfect because they're cute if
they keep the Sun out of your face and
they're super trendy right now and then
another one of my faves are like more
bohemian type hats that look like this I
think they're really cute as well a
really good tip I have for kind of
planning your outfits for a music
festival again I said it are to bring
rompers for one they don't take up a lot
of room in your luggage
I just think ones with fun designs and
colors are super cute this is just a
purple one I actually wore this last
year it's just like one thing you don't
have to worry about bringing shorts and
a top it's just one thing you just throw
into your luggage they're nice and
breathable throughout the day when it's
hot but then at night when it gets
colder they have longer sleeves so
you're still nice and warm now if you
are going to bring shorts and a top
which obviously I do recommend as well
because I think it's
cute outfit there are two types of
things that I love so the first top
being and off-the-shoulder
top like I'm wearing right now or one
like this just goes off the shoulders
and it's a crop top something that's
really breathable that also looks very
bohemian and cute then another option I
have for shirts and something that's so
on-trend right now our body suits so
here's an example of a body suit that I
have and that I love something that's
very thin strapped low in the back so it
gives off that sexy pule plus you can
wear a metallic tattoo on your back and
it would look so cute and it's just easy
to throw on underneath like shorts or
skirt and it's really good for layering
as well like if you want to wear like a
kimono or something it just looks so
good underneath a pair with those two
outfits I chose a pair of my favorite
shorts and these are just boyfriend
style shorts they look like this they're
very baggy you wear them a little bit
lower so they show off a little bit of
your stomach and I like something that's
a little bit more baggy when it comes to
a festival just because I love that
bohemian look and that very I guess
boyfriend look now onto some accessories
some of my favorite accessories that I
think you just need one of them being
bandanas so this reminds me of being a
kid I grew up in the 90s and these were
so popular so a lot of people wear them
like around your neck and they kind of
just tie them like that obviously make
them cuter this looks a little bit crazy
but I think they're so adorable as for
sunglasses I think something that's
going to block this most Sun possible is
great so I have these oversized aviator
sunglasses that are very inexpensive and
I think look amazing so these would be
so cool with a hat kind of like look
what I'm wearing now maybe the white
off-the-shoulder tall plus I do
recommend bringing in expensive
sunglasses to a festival because you
never know what's going to happen you
could lose them they could drop them
they could break and you're just kind of
going crazy because you're dancing you
don't want to have to worry about having
an expensive like pair of ray-bans on
your head that you're like oh don't want
to drop them and break them so then the
last must-have I want to talk about are
chokers because chokers are huge so here
is one that I love
so much I just love that it's like a
simple belt choker with a little charm
that dangles down I think it's really
great to have like layering pieces as
well and then my all-time favorite is
this simple little tiny leather one with
a tiny little charm in the middle and
that one looks very dainty and delicate
and I think they all kind of give off
something a little bit different but
with the chokers I would definitely
layer some other necklaces underneath
and just kind of have it all blend in
together I think that looks so great so
I have two types of shoes to talk about
first ones being these if you want to
wear some kind of booties with a heel I
do recommend wearing a chunkier heel
something that's a bit more thick so it
doesn't hurt as bad and you can kind of
dance around and be comfortable all day
and not have your feet killing also I do
recommend for something that has a bit
more of a heel to put in those like
insoles that are squishy that feel like
you're walking on like memory foam
because they're so comfortable and they
just help a ton also band-aids are a
huge thing bring band-aids because you
might get blisters and that sucks
so I just keep a few of my purse or like
those blister band-aids and then if you
want to wear something more flat these
kind of gladiator sandals are super
trendy while you literally cannot see
what they look like at all but basically
they're just flat sandals with black
over here and they crisscross going all
the way up your leg there's a zipper in
the back and you can dance around all
day plus they're flat so they don't hurt
your feet so if you're planning on going
to a festival soon I hope this helped in
some way these are just some of my
favorite things obviously you don't have
to dress this way these are just my
recommendations for things that I love
personally to wear to a music festival
comment down below letting me know if
you're going to any festivals soon maybe

wines and also let me know what you're
wearing because I'm so curious also
