channel another surprise video for you
I'm so awkward when I start my videos
like anyways I will cup realize my hair
was super greasy did not feel like doing
it so that's why it's up in this messy
bun happy new year 2016 what the heck
time just flies if you have a min
subscribe to my channel for a long time
then you actually wouldn't know this but
last year exactly on this day I put up a
video called my YouTube story and I
talked about how i started youtube why i
started youtube how I grew in my channel
how a group on my Instagram how that
whole thing happened and then also when
I was thankful for from that year of
2014 and then what I expected to come
2015 and I said I was going to be doing
a video like that every single year on
january first so here is my 2015 recap /
what I'm excited for 4 2016 holistic
almighty apologies in advance if I do
yeah so i actually just rewatched that
video I'll haven't linked down below if
you guys are curious to see it it's so
crazy to see how far I've come and like
now that the years actually over I got
to see what i did and i had no idea i
mean i knew i was gonna be doing a few
things but like this year was just I'm
not sure thousand fifteen for me was a
great year hopefully it was for you guys
to if not you can make 2016 the best
year ever that's the great thing about
the new years that you can always kind
of have like a little restart I mean
that's always how it's been in my head
so I guess we'll start with my stats on
this day i'm currently at um 400,000
subscribers on youtube which is insane
and like seven hundred and seventeen
thousand or like seven hundred and
twenty thousand followers on instagram
that's crazy i when i watch the video i
said i was at 250,000 followers and
150,000 subscribers like that is crazy
and my instagram blew up as soon as I
start traveling um I love travel photos
so I get why you guys love much
following my account for the travel pics
and stuff but I had no idea that it was
gonna grow this much it's like insane
in my head how many people follow my
Instagram account I can't even wrap my
mind around it like it's crazy yeah so
2015 I knew I was going to be traveling
I knew I had Barbados and to California
trips every other trip was not planned
yet and it just kind of fell into place
that I traveled every single month of
2015 that to me is insane like and
sometimes twice a month or three times a
month like there was a few months
especially this past fall where I
traveled so much like like I learned
from that that it's probably not the
best because my channel suffers my
health suffers my sleep suffers
everything is just like MA even though
it's worth it because I'm traveling it's
just like my body can't take it so I
know to kind of pace myself from now on
but yeah it just it's crazy where time
goes and how I don't even know how to
formulate my words right now because
it's just what I think about 2015 I'm
like the stuff that's happened how much
I've grown as a person what challenges
I've gone through and overcome and just
like personal wise and even with like my
social media it's just insane getting to
meet so many of you that was probably
the highlight like everywhere I've
traveled I met just tons of you so thank
you so much for coming up to say hi it's
really cool I don't know it makes me so
happy to see that you guys actually like
my videos and want to be my friend
vaginas I don't know I grew up like not
having many friends and stuff and kind
of reason why turn to youtube so also i
just woke up so my voice is like in do I
mean what is this black thing oh that's
my jacket it's currently snowing a lot
of snow outside happy about that 2015
was a crazy here I'm so happy and so
thankful and so grateful for you guys
you have no idea like no idea what you
guys do for me it's crazy all you do is
watch my videos and support you but it
it like
anyways so 2016 is gonna be great um my
goal is to hit a million on Instagram I
think that we could do it I mean I'm
getting quite close I used to think when
I started that it was impossible and I
said look at people that I million
followers and was like oh my god there's
no way and it's not that like this is
the end all hbu oh I'm like oh my god I
need a million like to me it doesn't
matter like if I stay at this exact spot
I'm happy I don't care as long as I have
you guys it really doesn't matter but
it's cool to have goals and like that's
just something that I mean who wouldn't
want to reach a million like that's just
like what the heck is just a milestone
and I mean I'm happy with whatever but
it's just something that you know Kat
and I were talking about and it's just
crazy that it's actually someone
achievable and the fact that I was in a
magazine that's something that's insane
the fact that I got to travel so much Oh
2016 try and hit a million followers on
Instagram and just really focus on my
main channel videos like I really want
to make good quality content for you
guys so sometimes that may mean that I
might not put up a video twice a week
every single week I mean I still want to
try and do that but if I am like
traveling a lot and I really want to
come out with a good video takes a long
time to edit and I don't want to just
throw up videos for you guys because I
know you like them but I just feel like
sometimes I throw out videos just so you
guys couldn't watch something but then
they're not good quality and I'm like oh
you know I really want to like focus on
doing something really good for you guys
so I can bring out really amazing videos
and puts a lot of stress on me so that's
something that I'm really focusing on
for two thousand 2016 is like destress
relax realize that it's really not the
end of the world if I don't come out
with a video twice a week every single
week realize that it's not the end-all
be-all if I don't have photos every day
on Instagram really work on myself my
personal time but still come out with
good quality stuff for you guys you know
like I just feel like this year I
focused so much on my social media and
less on my personal life so I do want to
be able to work more on my personal life
and really be able to
work on both in a more realistic way
instead of just like pushing so hard on
one and like neglecting the others
that's my main goal and I'm the kind of
person that I don't really make new
year's resolutions I'm not like okay I'm
not gonna drink soda for a full year
even though I've done that before but um
I'm more like I'm just gonna work on
myself I'm gonna work on being happy and
it just kind of go with the flow and I
don't set any strict strict guidelines
because then I you know I feel pressured
and like upset if they don't happen so I
kind of just like you know what just
focus on relaxing the one thing I really
want to start doing is meditating that
is something that I am never able to do
and I find it very hard and for some of
the anxiety it's very important to kind
of be at one with yourself and mimi
always tells me that i need to meditate
even if it's for ten minutes in the
morning as soon as you wake up and at
night before you go to bed it's just
very important so that's something that
I really want to start doing also
another thing i really want to start
doing is working out when a whale
vacation it's something that I always
try and do but doesn't really happen
because I get too busy but I really want
to make time to you know in the morning
as soon as I wake up don't be lazy don't
just go down for breakfast at the hotel
like do a workout even if it's for like
15 minutes i'm just doing jumping jacks
like do something because every time I
get back from a trip which has been so
often now I feel oh and like I don't
feel like working out I'm like oh you
know like I just get into that rut if I
stay consistent I always feel good so
just why not stay consistent yeah and so
2016 there's going to be a lot more
travel plans hopefully a really big
Montreal meetup that's something that
I'm really working hard on it's just
this is the main issues it's hard to
find a location to do it like if it's
going to be in a mall or in a store or
whatever it is it's really hard to
figure that out especially with like
security and stuff just so people like
you guys don't get hurt and finding a
location is hard because if we do in a
mall and that blocks off some other
stores and it's just a lot going into it
it's easier in some other places in the
world because you have like big things
outside that you could do a nap but in
Montreal you don't really have that my
dogs are barking anyways I'm really
excited for 2016 I know a lot of people
are like oh f 2015 Callie 4 2016 but I
feel like that's the same for most
people every year I just feel like
except the year as it is
and move on from it don't like be angry
don't be upset over it I think that's it
for what I want to do in 2016 because
obviously travel is something that
became very passionate about this past
year even though I'm terrified of flying
and I'm so bad on planes it's just
something I continue to do because it
just pushes me outside my comfort zone
proud of myself and for you guys I just
wish you all the best of luck for this
year don't set unrealistic goals because
then you're just setting yourself up for
like being upset what I would suggest is
you know small goals here and there just
making yourself a happier person also
dan is doing something quite big on his
channel right now he's really trying to
promote positivity and happiness for you
guys so he's putting up like a small
video every single day 4 2016 I know
it's kind of a lot but he wants to do it
so we'll see if he can stick with it I'm
proud of him for doing it but he wants
to talk about like happiness and how to
stay happy and motivated and all that
kind of stuff so I think it's really
good i'll leave this channel down below
if you want to check it out but yeah I
wish you guys all the best new year ever
and I'm so excited to see where we go
and where this journey takes us and you
guys are amazing and I'm so appreciative
over every single one of you and I just
all wish I could give you a big hug I'm
hugging you through the screen okay I
love you all so much and I'll see you
guys all tomorrow because I hope you do
come in tomorrow
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
