for me I get pretty much the same exact
questions on almost every single
Instagram pictures so I asked you guys

for video and I figured I would go into
more details so you don't have to ask
those questions all the time you can
just figure them up here also I just to

know that it's
interesting and let dot cross asks where

the most and I really want to travel I
want to go back to Australia because I
loved it so much but I really want to go
to Hawaii and Greece those are my two
main things that I want to do next
because I've never been to either places
but there are so many places in the
world I would love to go like I want to
travel everywhere I literally just want
to go everywhere okay I'm totally gonna
butcher this name I'm so sorry but it
Cove scarm sorry have you ever visited
any country in Europe um I have I've
been to Hungary when I was only 9 years
old and it's because I'm half Hungarian
so I went to Budapest with my
grandparents and my parents and my
sister it was really incredible it was
so much fun even though I was only nine
years old I do have a lot of memories
from that place and my grandparents were
actually from Hungary I would love to go
back to Hungary one day and travel more
like outside of Budapest but I also
really want to go to Italy because I am
half Italian my dad is Italian and his
mom was from Naples his dad was from
altissimo and then savatya kind of like
travel down afterwards so I would love
to go to the places that like I have
family but I would also love to explore
on it all of Italy and all of Europe I
just want to go everywhere cane hand
loose 23 asks have you ever been
insecure about your body if so how did
you deal with it and PS I love you so
much I love you too um but yeah I have
been really insecure about my body when
I was younger I was very skinny like
very very skinny in elementary school I
was a stick and I don't know why I ate
so much and I like ate like crazy I was
also an athlete so I was a competitive
swimmer and I was super hyper child so I
was always outside playing climbing
trees doing things like I was so active
but I ate a lot and I loved eating I
just I don't know it was like my
metabolism or something I was just very
skinny and here I'll answered a picture
yes this is
cute Pfizer huh yeah I remember like
trying on skinny jeans when they first
came in style and there was no like hat
that fit me everything was loose on me
and I used to get like I made fun of for
hola because of that people used to call
me Ana Rexach people used to say I don't
eat like they used to throw like stuff
at me and be like eat a sandwich or
something you know and for me that was
really hard because I wanted nothing
more than to be normal but then I as I
got older I realized like there is no
such thing as normal like everyone is
themselves and your body is what you're
given with and that's that you just need
to be happy with yourself cuz I remember
coming home from school standing in from
the mirror and crying because when I put
my legs together they didn't touch and
like my knees of knee bones would touch
but I have like the biggest thigh gap
and like it was just I used to cry about
all the time because nothing fit me and
people asked me all the time if I was
anorexic and it just really hurt my
feelings because I used to think like
you would never go over to an overweight
person and make fun of them for being
overweight or saying like you have an
eating disorder do you eat too much like
you would never do that but for someone
that's very skinny like a lot of people
because of like the social norm just
think that they're sick or something
which I wasn't sick I literally was just
this I was just kind of crazy fast
metabolism now I don't really it's not
really the case from anymore I feel like
I'm much more healthy as I went through
puberty you gain a lot of body fat and
in certain areas and I have been
completely comfortable with my body type
I do just have to learn to accept who
you are and don't care what other people
think because I honestly someone makes
fun of me now I'm just like okay I don't
care like it just does not bother me Liv
underscore laughs 1 2 2 7 asks your most
embarrassing high school experience
basically my whole life in high school
was a funny experience
Aisha lovey I think that's how you say
it assha lovey asks who are your
favorite youtubers right now if this
always kind of changes but right now I'm
really into zoella she is like my
favorite beauty guru and also my hater
vlogger I really like watching her vlogs
her and Alfie are so cute I'm sure you
guys all know who she is but I think
she's awesome I really like her and
I like I watched so many youtubers it's
crazy lovelorn Elizabeth is really funny
I honestly think she's hilarious major
rinks is really funny as well I like her
videos Claudia those three and other
friends and stuff I really like them
also this Taccone Jolie's their vlogging
channel is awesome I think that their
children are the cutest things in the
world and I want my children to look
like that and I know that Anna's sister
Erica I think you watch my videos but I
also watch your videos and I think
they're awesome and I think you're so
beautiful if you guys are interested in
watching Erica's videos because she just
started a channel I will leave her link
down below as well as all her
information because she's so studying
and she lives in Ireland and I'm really
jealous because I really want to go to
Ireland Ireland has been like the
country I've wanted to visit since I was
little I don't know why I love Irish
folklore I just have a class on like
Ireland I just think it's such an
awesome country yeah I just really like
her so hi if you're watching this dork
so a lot of these questions are like
I've gotten these questions a while and
I've actually answered them in previous
q and A's so if you're interested in
seeing my other Q&amp;amp;A videos I'll leave
them down below because I don't want to
repeat the same answers over and over
again
Alex peek asks how many children do you
want in the future um obviously depends
on my financial situation but ideally I
would like to have two my boyfriend was
brought up there were four children in
the family so I think he wants four but
um I am the one that has to give birth
so we'll see how it goes after the first
two if we're able to afford another two
maybe why not I don't see why not
I love children I'd love to have a big
family but I mean I need to see in the
future and that's also saying if me and
my boyfriend end up getting married and
having children because we don't know
what the future holds that's in a long
time from now
Ness underscore photography says how do
you resist eating whatever you want um I
kind of do eat whatever I want to be
honest I'm not a huge like okay I'm not
gonna say this because I like junk food
and stuff but I also like healthy food
like I really like salads I really like
balls fruit I really like healthy food
and eating healthy so for me that is
something I want because I like it but I
don't tell myself oh I'm not gonna have
chips I'm not gonna have french fries
I'm not gonna have ice cream because if
I deprive myself from it then I just get
upset and I don't eat excessive amounts
like I eat everything in moderation and
that's just always how I was raised
so I think just for me it just works
that way because I don't feel like I
need to binge eat any like pizza or
anything and acts Palvin
asks do you regret anything or do you
wish that you could turn back time and
change something no I really don't like
to live with in regret I don't like to
live and think oh my gosh I wish you
could go back in to help me change
something I used to think that way when
I was in high school and in all honesty
it's not good to think that way because
you're just stuck living in the past and
regretting it so much when you can just
focus on the present and the future and
better your life because things go on
that time goes on things that seem so
important at the time are not going to
be important years down the road so why
waste your time worrying about something
that can't be changed instead of living
your life and being happy that's just my
motto and my grandfather used to always
say to let go he's to always say bingo
so that's how I like to live just let go
of everything whatever drama you have in
the past whatever problems you have with
anyone just let it go and be happy and
try not to live in regret and negativity
because it's just not good for you Keely
McPherson asked straight hair forever or
short hair forever I guess
straight hair forever because then I can
just curl it and if I wanted short hair
I could just cut it hello Haley asks if
you could live in any state in the u.s.
which state would you would it be in -
Callie you're so cute yeah I would love
to live in Cali
I think eventually one day I might live
in LA just for a little bit just because
opportunity and stuff but um in all
honesty I would love to live in the
south I think would be so cool
I've never been to the South but I would
love to live there as well as I guess in
New York because New York is very
similar to Montreal I'm so used to it so
I guess those states no but Idaho is so
beautiful because this she turns it from
there and the Mount isn't it okay this
is too hard I can't pick Mackenzie
underscore now dur asks favorite type of
music and favorite song at the moment my
favorite type of music is probably indie
rock at the moment but I love listening
to classic classic rock and all that
kind of stuff I love us into classical
music sometimes too it's weird but yeah
definitely indie rock is um my genre
right now and I think first song at the
moment probably Riptide by Vance joy
just cuz Karina and got that song stuck
in my head but I really like that and
also I've been listening to a lot of
Fleetwood Mac so I think chain by
Fleetwood Mac is probably the song that
I've had on repeat for a while Boston
Nettie asked what are your favorite
stores to shop at free people Urban
Outfitters Brandi I really like Windsor
for online shopping because there's none
near me what else do I like I think
that's about those are like the top one
oh one teaspoon I love one teaspoon
those are the top ones that I like I
like to shop at ariane mode asks what do
you like and hate about living in
Montreal so there's nothing I really
hate about living in Montreal other than
like the super super long and cold
winters oh and the taxes okay yeah we
have really high tax right here it's 15%
it's really my but our health care is
like really cheap and our schools are
really cheap like to go to school in
Montreal is super cheap and we have some
of the best schools here but I would
definitely say that I would pick the
expensive school and expensive Medicare
over the super high taxes because we're
getting ripped off just a little bit but
other than that Montreal is a beautiful
city
it's very cultured there is like the
French in the English and it's it's
really beautiful here Estelle Anderson
asks since you said you bleached your
hair and then just let it be do you have
to use a lot of oils and serums to make
your hair soft so if you guys don't know
I don't dye my hair ombre I had this was
like the color of like my whole head at
one point I had like super blonde hair
was disgusting don't ever ask me why I
did it I do not know to this day look
back her pictures alone so basically one
day I was like I want Umbra hair so I
started letting me roots grow out and
this is basically where they are now I
think last summer they were here and now
they're here my hair grows pretty fast
but yes I do use a lot of oils and
serums to the ends of my hair because
they are very dead I do need a trim so I
trim my hair every like six to eight
months and I do use like Moroccan oil
and all that stuff at the ends I find
the less amount of heat the less amount
of products you put in it the better I
say this as my hair is straight but I
haven't strained my hair in like two
years
it's trying to look more healthy which
I'm really excited about Chrissie Clara
says do you use extensions yes guys oh
my gosh the amount of times I say this I
don't know how many times to say this
but I do wear extensions I don't wear
them on an everyday basis I use them
mainly for like like pictures and stuff
and sometimes tutorials but like I
always say if I am putting some of my
hair and it's mainly for volume a lot of
you guys asked like how long they are
is my hair fake and super short my hair
is not super short my hair it's actually
pretty long it comes down to like here
but I usually add some extensions
because my hair is very thin at the ends
especially now that it's straight oh my
gosh I just realized health and it is
not because it's dead it's pretty
healthy it's just thin so I add for more
volume and my sister does is too like my
sister's extensions are literally the
same length as her hair it's just more
to like give her like volume ur hair and
make
here look more full since I don't have
the thickest hair I have pretty fine
thin hair so if I'm doing a certain
hairstyle that I want to that I want it
to look really full and nice I'll add
some extensions just to give it that
like extra like puffiness but it's not
really for length itself I mean I like
they're probably an inch longer than my
natural hair so it's not really like
doing that much of a difference my hair
grew a lot this year it has never been
this long in my entire life and I'm just
super happy with it I guess that's all
the questions I can answer because I
don't this video should be super long
and boring but I hope you guys enjoyed
it and don't worry this makeup look will
