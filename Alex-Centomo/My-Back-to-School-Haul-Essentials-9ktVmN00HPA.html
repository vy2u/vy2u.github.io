channel I hope you guys are having a
good day wherever you are in the world
if you're not then I hope this video can
bring you a smile or a laugh or make you
feel better because there's something
worse than having a crappy day so I'm
still going with this back-to-school
trend because I'm loving it right now I
know a lot of you guys are loving it and
are finding it very helpful so I was
gonna do a back to school haul part two
kind of thing but then a lot of the
things I was getting shipped in didn't
fit properly had to send some stuff back
and I was like you know and I'll
probably just end up doing a haul come
end of September just like a collective
haul so I'm gonna do a video about
must-haves that I would have used when I
was in school things that I think are
important to keep that a lot of people
forget and I mean it's not like a
mandatory thing you don't have to bring
this stuff with you and if you think of
anything else you could bring that as
well so the first thing I want to talk
about are I think one of the most
important things when it comes to school
and that is a watch so watches are first
of all I know you can check your phone
to check the time but in all honesty you
should not be on your phone when you're
in school keep it for when you're on
your lunch break or recess or in between
classes if you have a break try not to
go on your phone in class it's really
bad it's really distracting when I was
in high school
smart phones didn't really exist we I
had like the razor flip phone and I
would always keep it in my locker and it
wasn't like a thing to happen in class
also if you were caught with it in class
it would get taken away but then when I
was older in college a lot of the
teachers allowed you to have your phone
in class so I would always just like
have my iPhone on my table and then I
would just be texting my friends or
whatever and I get so distracted so a
lot of costumes at least for me would be
either the time would be wrong or like
the clocks in the classroom they would
be old not working properly or sometimes
the teachers didn't even have them and I
like hated aspirins for the time and I'm
the kind of person that I need to know
how long I have left in a class or also
go crazy and it feels like it's just
forever so I tell them you guys if you
do this but if I look at the time I'm
like okay there's 30 30 minutes left of
class or 40 minutes left of class that's
just 10 minutes
four times or ten minutes three times I
should have to sit through ten minutes
three times and then I would think like
that which is bad because I'd be
distracted again but then I would like
you know every make a point of like
looking I'll be like okay because that's
especially if the class is boring but it
kind of got me through it so I think
watches are a great idea plus these
watches are so acute if you guys could
see this look how cute that is guys so
this is from Daniel Wellington this one
I really liked because it's a small
little tiny black strap so it's not too
overpowering you can layer it with
bracelets if you want and it just
reminds me of like my grandfather's
watch yeah so I have this one and what I
really like about the Daniel Wellington
washes are in the packaging I don't know
why I just think is this so sleek and
cute so you open it up as if it's a
little book like that but it's great to
keep to put jewelry inside as well and
then I got this swatch too because I
couldn't decide whether I liked the
brown or the black and I thought that it
would go with so many different kinds of
things as you can see this one has like
a blue hand and I think it's really cool
plus I just like that they're dainty
this one has like rose gold I love it
Daniel Lynch and actually let me know
that they're having a promotion right
now and that means that with every
purchase of a leather strap like this
you get a free nano strap or NATO I
don't know how to pronounce it it's n
ATO and you get a free shot because
they're interchangeable you can actually
take off the strap so like I said you
get a free strap with every purchase of
a leather strap watch and I'll also have
a link down below if you guys are
curious to check out the product there
will also be a discount code for you
guys so make sure you check it out the
next two things I think are important
than things I always used to forget but
one of them being hand sanitizer
now schools are very dirty they just are
and I think now everyone has time to in
the bathroom and wash their hands before
they eat and sometimes you want a quick
snack and it's gross so just having
something like this on hand I think for
me personally is really important and
just makes it so that you're not eating
whatever you've been touching all day
here I'll is fine anything like that's
fine and then also going along with that
hygiene personal hygiene but deodorant a
small little thing of deodorant to have
in your bag is so important or in your
locker sometimes throughout the day
you'll like raise your arm and then be
like oh my god never mind
this definitely happen to me or after
gym class or something and you forget
your deodorant if you have a small one
like that's just in your locker at all
times it's like a lifesaver and I
started doing that near the end of high
school and I was so happy that I started
doing that next thing I think is
important to have not just in school but
at all times sunscreen so a small bottle
like this is really good you can use
this on your face because it's actually
for your face but you can just use it on
the rest of your body as well and if
you're gonna be outside during lunch or
during a break it's important to start
caring about your skin being the age
that I am now I'm starting to realize
that like I really let myself go and I
never used to put sunscreen on I never
used to protect my skin I would
literally lie outside and like baby oil
and it was really bad and talking to a
lot of women that are older they really
regret that and when you're younger you
think of whatever I'll deal with that
when I'm older or thought what happened
to me but like it will and it sucks and
it can create a lot of actual health
issues so very important this is like
the number one thing I think you need to
have at all times just apply in the
morning if you're going out before lunch
you should apply it again if you're
wearing a bunch of makeup on your face I
don't know if that protects you from the
Sun but at least for the rest of your
body you can use this I just think it's
important this one is just from Kiehl's
it's a super fluid one SPF 50 plus you
can buy small ones from the drugstore
and help them be a lot more inexpensive
this was just sent to me once back in
the day and I've been using it ever
since I liked it a lot the last thing I
have for personal hygiene which I forgot
to talk about before and I've talked
about these in previous videos but it's
the OB tap on and these tampons I'm not
just saying this guys like I actually
use these all the time
tampons are so tiny like they're so so
so small it saves a lot on plastic
because the things are so small so
you're not throwing out this big thing
of plastic which is really bad for the
environment basically and I said this in
my last video but when you're using your
finger
this is gonna sound strange but we're
all human beings this is natural so
because of the way that the tampon is
I'll show you guys but the way that this
is made is like super small you pull out
the string and then you kind of move it
front to back left to right to open up
the little place to insert your finger
and then when you actually put it in you
can place it properly which means you
don't feel it it doesn't budge and it
definitely will not get stuck like don't
worry that will not happen I find these
are really really absorbent they work
really well and you will never feel
uncomfortable and that's like the best
part about them plus the fact that
they're really small so if you wanted to
you could just you don't have to put the
whole box in your school bag you can
actually just leave a tiny one like in
the side of your backpack or something
small you can even put it in like I
don't know a little tiny candy wrapper
or something that just you know it's so
tiny like I know a lot of people are
embarrassed when they put like pull it
on top on or something I personally
never was but I can understand that a
lot of friends that were and especially
if like a guy sees it it's kind of you
know when you're young you feel
embarrassed over it what you shouldn't
cuz it's natural but if you do at least
they're very small so they're very easy
to put it in your pencil case or
anything like that
super simple in your pocket no one can
see it you can go to the bathroom
change it up come back it's good so I
really recommend that for those I'll
have a link as well so you guys can
check them out and I think for school it
makes it a lot simpler for that time of
month next being this water bottles
always always always always always
always have something that you can that
keep yourself hydrated it's so important
I drink so much water throughout the day
what's great about this bottle is that
you can actually like take it off here
so you can put in ice and lemon or mint
or whatever and then it stays cold it
has a nice grip and it's like a actual
water bottle but it's hard so you can't
actually like push it or whatever but um
I don't know if all classes allow you to
having a water bottle but they really
should because it's very very important
if they don't then that's really messed
up but I was always allowed to water
bottle and I would drink this non-stop
punch that meant I had to the bathroom a
lot throughout school which is not the
best thing but whatever number one band
tees people either hate or love band
cheese I personally love them because I
actually listen to that kind of music
there's nothing wrong with you wearing a
shirt that says the WHO on it and you've
never listened to the music if you like
the shirt you wear the shirt who cares
like really who cares you know it's not
a big deal but I genuinely by the band
tees of bands that I actually listen to
because I just I'm fans so for one Jimi
Hendrix love and I always get them
oversized because it's really cool you
can like time up tuck them in have them
like hana loose over your shoulder or
just like super baggy and comfy I just
love ban tees that are oversized so I'm
showing you these two that are from
Windsor they're very inexpensive and
they're super cute so Jimi Hendrix is
the first one the next one I have yet to
wear but I love it it's Pink Floyd and
it's for my favorite album Dark Side of
the Moon
so that is a definite hit for me if
you're not into the bad teas I think
simple teas are just perfect that are
neutral colors so anything that is like
grayish or muted pink muted purple muted
I don't raised and everything it's just
the best this one is from Brandi and I
really like Brandi because they have the
best basics ever and this is just a
simple t-shirt could not get more simple
than this if you tried and it's not
cropped so you can wear it with
literally everything I think my favorite
outfit right now are like super
oversized denim jackets with a t-shirt
like this and leggings and sneakers
speaking of leggings these leggings I
think are perfect for back-to-school
because you they have a bit of like the
mesh cutout on them which i think is
still really cool and still school
appropriate but it gives something a bit
different to your leggings I've spoken
about these many times before but these
are from a yoga I also have a pair from
Hollister which were you know more
affordable but I think forever 21 came
out with some
I just think honestly any legging or
something that's tight and you wear like
a super oversized t-shirt with it and a
cardigan or a jean jacket or bomber just
looks really cute
and leggings are super comfortable so
you can spend all day in your leggings
then the last thing I want to talk about
is this this is an oversized cardigan
and I think these are really good on
days where you don't really know what
the weather's gonna be like because
where I'm from it's one of those things
where you wake up and it's freezing cold
and then by the end of the day you're
literally like it's you want to take off
all your clothes cause it's so hot so
having something that's easy to kind of
like take on and off it's really you
know practical so something you know
what to take off over your head but just
kind of wraps around like a cardigan
it's fine this is from Urban Outfitters
it's actually really old so I don't
think they'll have it available anymore
but anything like this I'll leave a loot
a few links down below of things that I
found online that I really like and I
think would be perfect don't forget that
I love you guys all so much and give
this video a thumbs up if you liked it a
back-to-school hairstyle video will be
coming very soon don't worry I love you
guys and I'll see you all in my next
video
