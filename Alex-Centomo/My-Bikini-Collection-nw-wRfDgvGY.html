requests lately has been to do a bikini
collection I've cut off doing this video
for a long time because I just figured
you guys most of you follow me on
Instagram if not like the majority of my
followers are from Instagram so I mean I
promote all that bikinis in pictures on
Instagram and I always tag in the
picture where the bathing suit is from
and stuff but I've been getting so many
requests to do this video
the only thing why I was also putting it
off is that I don't want to show like
video of me wearing the bathing suits
just because all of these suits are on
my Instagram account and I do model them
I do show outfit pictures so if you are
interested in seeing what these bikinis
look like on you can either check out
the website down below where I will link
all the bikinis to or you can check out
my Instagram to see what they look like
on my body because I know like
everyone's bodies different and stuff
but anyways yes let's just get into it
because I have so many bikinis in it
sacks ridiculous I'll start off with my
newest pieces because I just got them in
and I haven't actually worn them but
they're for Italy you guys didn't know
I'm going to Italy on Monday so I'm so
excited I'm going to like the Amalfi
Coast Sorrento well we're actually
staying in Sorrento but we're going to
the Amalfi Coast
Positano Pompeii we're spending some
time in Rome so I'm really excited and
also if you're from Italy let me know in
the comments down below because I'm
going with my sister and my cousin
Sophia and my parents and we would love
to give you a big hug and thank you for
all your support so got some bikinis for
Sorrento okay so the first one is from L
face and it's ooh it's this design right
here so the bottoms look like this
there's like this weird Aztec purple
green yellow material look like this in
the back with a bit of ruching really
like them they're super cute make the
butt look good and then this one is a
much like super popular top this is the
one that like wraps in the front so oh
my god how am I gonna show this alright
basically you wrap the bikini around
your body and you tie it in the back so
it has great support for the boobies I
have a white one like this that I wore
in Santorini and everyone went crazy for
it so this is the exact same bikini top
but it's in the same print as the
bottoms and then as well is that print I
got this print as well it's the exact
same bikini except a different print so
oh the bottoms are actually a bit
different these are more cheeky bottoms
as you could tell they're not as full
coverage but this print is actually
really nice like yellow blue purple
turquoise really pretty colors the wrap
around again really like that because it
makes your boobs look so good I find
then the next one from Elle space again
same type of bottoms so these are cheeky
on days where I'm tanning just like in
the Sun I like to tan the buttocks
because I don't really like tan lines
they annoy me and then the top that came
with it was this top so this actually
reminds me of a bikini I got for my
cousin in Sofia but it's from Frankie's
bikinis but this one is from Elle space
and I think I love it even more just
because it has more to it you'll see
what I mean in a second so this is the
to the front just looks like this nice
cut pitch of the boob oops
and then the back is like super strappy
so yeah you're not going to be able to
see this at all but I'm going to be
taking so many pictures of this in Italy
so get ready for that because you'll get
first glimpse in this video of this
amazing bikini and then the next bikini
I got was from shopbop if you don't know
what sha pop is it's a website that's
like one of my favorite websites because
it ships in like a day like I will order
something and I'll be here next day it's
awesome so I got this bikini for Italy
but I ended up wearing it to my cottage
up north because I love it so much it's
my new favorite the bottoms look like
this back is cheeky but not as like long
as the other one and it's by acacia
swimwear I love acacia
their bathing suits are like the best
quality ever so that is from acacia and
then the tub is my new favorite top and
it looks like this it's by Mara Hoffman
and I recently just posted a pic
Instagram wearing this and ever almost
like freaking out over it it's like so
simple but so pretty I find it's white
with like green palm tree leaves and I
love the color of this and it's kind of
more of a skimpy bikini like it really
shows off the boobs um it's really nice
really flattering love it so much so
many compliments on that bikini I guess
I'll go off with the rest of my acacia
swimwear the first piece I've shown this
before in videos on an on Instagram but
it's a like high-waisted bikini bottom
from acacia swimwear light pink almost
white looking color super cute and
flattering really reminds me of like
Marilyn Monroe I've shown this many
times of course I'm not gonna go into
detail about because you guys have seen
it but it's so cute and this would like
a simple like fondo top like not much to
it at all because this obviously is like
a big statement piece so cute I wouldn't
tan in this but I would definitely um go
to like a pool party or beach party
wearing this cuz it's amazing and then
the same exact print as that with the
same color and style is this bikini that
I've actually shown again on my account
looks like this so the bottoms are kind
of cheeky same exact color with this
pretty detailing on the side and the top
is actually like a halter bikini top
like this so these are super trendy and
popular again I wouldn't tan in this but
I wore it in Greece and like everyone
freaked out over it's so pretty and I
really like it so these are all the same
color um I really like that color on me
because of my like ombre blonde hair and
my tan skin I think it looks really nice
then I'm going to go into triangle I
have two triangle bikinis I'll start
with the one I got last year so the
first one I got is just this matte black
looking
bikini so this these are the bottoms it
almost looks like leather I feel like
this is the top it's just a simple
triangle that's
matte-black you guys don't know I'm sure
you all know that triangle is like
neoprene material material so it's like
wetsuit material so I'm not the biggest
fan of the bottoms to be honest like I
love the tops and I wear the tops with
like different bottoms but like
unfortunately you can't just buy the top
which is really annoying you have to get
the bottoms I mean they're still cute
but just personally from either to full
coverage and like too stiff for my butt
so the next one I got was this one I got
this one this year these are the bombs
that came with but I never wear these I
always wear the top with other bottoms
just because like I said not the biggest
fan but it's still cute and you know my
sister enjoys wearing them so she'll
wear them more than I will this is the
top love the top think it's so cute and
pretty just the pink and white one and I
wear this a lot with umm these bottoms
are then because this matches like the
color bottoms that it came with but
they're just more like my style bottoms
so I guess going off with bottoms these
are from ELF space they're simple
bottoms with like this detailing on the
side and the top that came with it was
this just a bondo top for this insanity
and you got so many compliments on it on
like that mounting picture there you
know I'm talking about love this okay
then the other else face bikini I have
is this is the one I was talking about
the white one so these are the bottoms
same bottoms is the first bikini I
showed you and then this is the
wraparound top that's on my Instagram
all over the place and like all over we
hoard it because everyone keeps free
posting that picture there's no way I
can show you this just go go to my
Instagram account and check it out it's
a wraparound top it's blue with like I
mean it's white with blue
tailing super cute and in the last
bikini I have from L space is this one
so these are the same exact bottoms
someone's I just showed you and they're
actually reversible so I can wear them
in like the black color if I wanted to
and then the top looks like this so it
ties around your neck and this is the
front it's the same pattern in the back
you have these like three strings that
go across your back that's really nice I
wore this a ton in Santorini really
flattering on the chest area and then I
got to have a few bikinis from San
Lorenzo so the first one is this one
right here which is probably my favorite
one this is the bondo top like this it's
reversible so you can have it on the
blue side or the pattern sign I
personally like the pattern sign side
it's like a baby teal and a baby pink
color and I like the front like this
part right here it's super pretty and I
wear this a lot in California when I was
there and then these are the bottoms as
you know San Lorenzo is very cheeky so
again this is like a thong but I really
like it and it has this on the side
little braiding thing really cute the
next V Keeney from San Lorenzo is this
one so I usually like to wear this on
the white side but this is reversible
again so this is the front and then this
is the back and the other side looks
like this it's still super cute but I
just person liked the white better and
then as for the bottoms they're the same
just cheeky phone bottoms gives you like
such a good tan on the buttocks then I
also have this bathing suit from San
Lorenzo that I got a long time ago
actually reversible it looks like this
and then this is the front it's like one
of these tops that goes like this on
your body but this is really big on me
and to be honest I'm not the biggest fan
of this so I might give this to a friend
because I never wear it anymore and as
you can see I have so many bikinis so I
don't eat that one then another one of
my favorites is I just got recently
actually this run from mink pink so it's
like a high like halter bikini top
love it so flattering I just got the top
because they're a little pricey so I
didn't want to splurge on the bottom as
well because I have bottoms I can match
with it so I'd wear either like a white
bottom or black bottom or
a bright pink bottoms I think it's so
cute to mix and match then I have this
top from one teaspoon this is a 1
teaspoon bikini and I actually didn't
realize that 1 teaspoon made the keys
until I was on revolve clothing and I
was like oh wait a minute that's cute I
like that and so I got this is the
bikini top I got it's simple gray but in
the back it's the coolest part because
it's like metal nonmetal like leather
material in the back and it goes down
your back like erase your back so cute
so this is the top I just got the top I
wear that with black bottoms another
bottoms that I really like this is from
mink pink as well or where's this from I
think I got this off for evolved
clothing so you can just go look these
are the bottoms cymbal bottoms they're
reversible as well then you've seen this
on my Instagram account before it's like
an ombre colored bikini bottom and this
is from fellow swim or in Barbados and
the top looks like this very skimpy
actually but really cute so this is the
top because skinny that is like but it's
cute I like it then I have just a few
more bikinis to show you so the next one
is this one here and this is from
brinjai swimwear and I got it like last
summer I think and this is the front I
mean this is this is the bikini bottom
so it looks like this a little ruffle on
the side and then this is the top so it
looks like that I usually don't wear
them together actually I'll usually wear
this top with my Victoria's Secret
cheeky bottoms because I think it looks
cute together
these two colors so these are the
bottoms that I got they're cheeky
they're actually really big on me this
is a size small and big crazy ok guys
let me just show you an example of a
size small compared to Victoria's Secret
and then compared to San Lorenzo so I'm
a small in San Lorenzo like I actually
am it fits me point nice so this is a
small look at the difference
look how much further this goes if
you're a small in San Lorenzo I would
size down Victoria Secret if you're a
medium or small and Victoria's Secret at
50 true to size I would size up for San
Lorenzo and like majority of these
bikinis I'm just collecting Victoria's
Secret mix their sizes a bit bigger than
they say like they they're not true to
size in my opinion just off the ones
I've had I've honestly throughout so
many bikinis before this video probably
like 10 pairs and they're all Victoria
Secret because that's all I used to buy
like back in the day but now that I've
gone into more like Instagram bikini
accounts because I find them on
Instagram then I'm like oh my god these
these bikinis are sick like no one's
going to have them so then I ordered
them because everyone has Victoria
Secret veining suits where I live
because Victoria Secrets huge in
Montreal so I like to have different
bikinis okay and then the last bottoms I
have this is literally a thong like look
it's a literally a string in the back
but it's cute for when I'm like at the
pool the private pool at my cousin's
house when there's like no one there
okay so now I have four different
full-body be heat up full not bikinis
full-body swimsuits the first one I have
here I haven't actually shown this on my
Instagram yet but I'm bringing this to
Italy it's by Mara Hoffman and it's just
like a crazy color so this is a
one-piece it looks like this and it's
cut out in the on the sides it shows a
bit of the stomach really pretty bright
color I think it's gonna look great in
the Amalfi Coast like vile like the
colorful houses and stuff so excited to
wear this and then my next one is by
fella swam again I wore this in Barbados
and I got a lot of questions about it so
it looks like this it's a one-piece and
then it's super open on the side and
very low on the back and really shows
off like the side boob action really
cute love wearing it's a bit cheeky as
well then the next one I got off the
revolt clothing website and it's by the
brand Ella blue and it's a pink and
white polka dot like
you know it's a pink and white polka-dot
swimsuit you guys have seen this I
posted it all the time when I went to
Florida open back I think it's so
adorable and especially when it's a bit
chilly can throw like a gray sweater I
love that together and then the last but
not least and my favorite thing ever is
this one piece like soup by Frankie's
bikinis I'm totally in love with this I
think it's so beautiful it's just the
small navy blue or black stripes with
this like detail in the front on your
stomach and then it's open in the back
with these criss-cross rope straps
pretty lowdown and cheeky I love this
bathing suit so much this is my favorite
by all time out of everything I own so
