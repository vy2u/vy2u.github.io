boyfriend Daniel and we're gonna be
doing me my boyfriend does my makeup tag
which is just him doing my makeup he
doesn't really know attempting to yeah
II didn't really know what to do um he
watches me do it sometimes but I mean
for the most part not really we just
have like a table over here just full of
different kind of makeup a bunch of
brushes and he's just gonna don't know
what any of it is I'm just gonna dig in
and have some fun okay so you ready yeah
so I do know that she has to start with
her primer I've seen her done that
before I think I just do with my hands
so I'm gonna try and do that I have no
idea how much to use try that for now
we'll see if that works his fingers are
clean just if anyone's wondering here do
this even all these little tricks feel
so good what I've seen her do well she
does makeup and I
okay next I would think I don't even
know what these are some sort of
foundation coverage thing I don't even
know rush not much knew more than I did
with the other one because am I supposed
to be doing with my fingers it's up to
you here the yeah we're gonna make up
artist this is not right oh my god your
face is orange I don't know probably way
too much I'm gonna blend this in on the
brush my fingers are just watching it
tell me if I'm gonna be ruining a new
here try to make it nice I actually am
trying for it
this is totally failing oh my god I
can't put any around your back with your
about to light although there's a huge
orange wine when you chew here okay well
moving on that's enough that okay I'm
gonna use this because I think this
thing is gonna help blend it's not that
I think it's gonna help
what do you think this is called I don't
know I but I thought this was Foundation
and what's the brush a brush it's a 182
something gotta get that like Caribbean
look okay
like I just want a vacation
actually yeah is he doing a good job
guys
no should I do next
I should do a blush on your cheeks make
the pink this thing looks pink yeah now
I need a small brush look at the clown
can you guys just take a moment and look
at the brush that he's using for my okay
well now I know that I'm using the wrong
good honestly I'm not I'm trying as best
as I can I'm not doing this on purpose
I thought this was gonna be really easy
it doesn't even blend it just makes a
red dot on your face
I'm gonna poke your eye out but I'm
gonna try and do eyeliner and I don't
even know what that looks like what is
this no that's a brush yeah liquid
eyeliner I'm gonna put it on like the
edge of her eyelashes so what do I do
with my eyes right now do I close them
well then close or yeah close for when I
do the top and then you open it again
you can tell under your all yeah it's
stretcher are they
way better beside you are beautiful
found some blue eyeshadow let's use this
brush because it's little
so what do I do close your eyes
but like you see me doing my makeup do
you ever see me doing this no I thought
this is gonna be like actually pretty
easy but not at all
I actually thought you were gonna be
good I did too because I've watched you
before and this is the worst I've ever
seen
actually okay let's do mascara next
which is I don't know where of this
Maybelline oh it's huge
I don't you scared I'm gonna hurt you
I'll just go under your eyelid is like
going downwards on my top lashes no no I
was doing your bottom lashes obviously
don't have to go up on the up lash touch
your face oh I got the technique for
this is the only part that I'm gay
that's like up an out yeah now I'm doing
the down lashes over down
well I didn't even know their eyelashes
they're picky won't block the other oh I
just touched your face don't move don't
love me oh my god I just poked your eye
with it okay I don't even know what's
left to do now lips
what about like eyebrows I mean I just I
know you're supposed to do all this to
to make that blend in but I'm not gonna
blend
I'm not even you know attempt that no
it's like white and orange expert
shaping done let's do the lips now huh I
don't know if I put like a gloss on the
fourth of lipstick I don't know if
that's what I'm supposed to do what is
this
that is really pink that's like paint
I'm not gonna do I don't know just leave
the normal does your mouth
because it's a weight Wow
yeah rub it in like that I think that
looks good okay now let's do the pink
one read my mind
go old your red cheeks go like like
you're gonna kiss stop laughing and do
it if you're laughing I can't do it
anyways but maybe less harder so I'm
trying
I'm not doing this right there's no way
does any of this look good no so what
are you using now a gloss to make a
shiny and really bad
rub it in
okay well is that is that everything
did I forget it me is it I think so -
your neck and your shoulders give it a
nice smoky look like you always say
smokey eye color is like a dirt shiny
blue
oh so the blue to compliment the blue
yeah that's what I was thinking that
looks so much better everything to fix
now looks good
no doesn't but I tried so so done um
when you see me do my makeup in the
morning let's say yeah does it ever look
like this I'm not even close
no it looks like that's what like a four
year old draws when they draw a picture
so what made you think that this was
yeah I didn't I just started and
everything I did was wrong so I thought
it would be easy but I'm wrong well I
think I look really pretty well I
haven't actually seen myself yet should
I get him here here we go
there's her reaction we'll see what she
thinks worse than you thought or better
than you thought oh my way better it's
bad I told you I didn't know what I was
doing I honestly thought I was gonna be
good and I wanted to try to make it look
good but but oh can you leave that look
at your cheeks
it looks like I mauled your face with
pain I love how it just doesn't match oh
my god this is not and look at all the
dark brown streaks on your face this is
not what I thought it was gonna look
like yeah me neither
