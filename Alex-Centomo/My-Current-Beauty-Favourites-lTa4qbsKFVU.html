they're in Las Vegas it's a cute little
coyote I love him what's up guys welcome
back to my channel I decide to sit down
today and film kind of a requested video
a lot of you have been very curious as
to what beauty products I've been loving
lately I didn't do a January favorites
just because I hadn't honestly tried any
new products everything was the same old
that I've been doing and all of last
year I did a monthly favorites and I
tried out new things but to be honest I
didn't really try out anything different
for January but i do have favorites that
i always go back to every single month
and things that i love some new things
some older things since it is winter and
it's cold especially for me where I'm
from I mean I know you guys in LA are
getting like ridiculously hot weather
right now like summer weather but where
I live it's like the polar opposite we
are getting extremely cold weather so
it's like minus 27 it's ridiculous I
actually go outside and feel like my
bones are freezing there are a lot of
things that I'm going to be talking
about that are more towards winter but
for those of you in the summer there's
still really great products so I'm going
to start off with something that has
actually been introduced to meet quite
recently and it's something that I
absolutely fallen in love with it is a
company called sent bird and the reason
why I'm talking about is because they
actually asked me to be their muse of
the month which is completely insane I
was so honored to be all for that
opportunity it's so amazing so in every
box that is purchased for the month you
get this little card that has my name
and my Instagram my youtube and then
describe something about me and why I
like to switch up my sense and stuff as
you guys know i go through phases of
different sense that i really love and
become obsessed with like I talked about
that sent for a long time and I switch
on because I'm very picky with sense I
always want to try out different things
like I'm constantly in sephora testing
things but i never know what it's like
because you kind of have to wear the
perfume for a bit to really know if you
love it jo malone love that perfume
there are so many different ones that
i've been loving over the years but I've
always want to switch it up and I think
separate is a really good idea for that
the fact that I got to be their muses a
month is like insane and look how
awesome this card is K it's just
everything about it
my element it's purple how's my favorite
selfie on it which is like whatever I
just love this selfie it's like a dark
wood background it's crazy it's so
amazing and then it also has my scent of
the month which is really really crazy
because they chose a scent that was
based off with me my personality what I
liked and I honestly didn't know if
they're gonna like get it right but they
really did so it's by clean Reserve
which is the brand and it's velvet flora
so it's an authentic sophisticated and
sexy fragrance that exudes brightness
and confidence this scent is filled with
delightful warmth that illuminates
throughout so in the scent there's green
I'm not going to be able to like
pronounce it but there is like a citrusy
scent there's also more of a
jasmine-scented it and then the best is
there's a musky scent and you guys know
me my musky scent so it's just like all
those combined is just the perfect thing
so I was really happy with that and if
you guys don't know what semper it is
it's basically just a subscription box
service where you actually get to choose
a sample of perfume every single month
you get to make the decision it's 1495
very inexpensive and you get these like
little perfume things so it comes in a
little package like this it's velvet and
then it comes with the little scent
which is great because you could just
throw it in your purse you can bring it
to travel which is my biggest thing I
bring these on the plane all the time
and you just pop it up you spray it oh
this one's so good so you can also just
kind of pull it out if you want to
switch it up you can see here the bottle
is quite big if ever you're interested
in trying out different sense you don't
know what you like you can actually just
sign up you pick your scent of the month
this last for a full month and oh my god
perfume does not taste good though so I
don't recommend that and they literally
have every bread you could want like
Gucci Tom Ford we have why a cell they
have everything like if you look on
their list it just like you keep
scrolling and scrolling and scrolling so
so my scent of a month is actually a new
scent by clean it's their new line Queen
reserve and like I explained velvet
Flores the new scent I really like that
this round is equal conscious it's very
like sophisticated in an elegant way
that makes any sense if you guys are
interested in signing up you can use the
code Alex 25 at checkout works for men
and women boxes so
any subscription box and you'll get
twenty-five percent off your first
purchase so i'll have details listened
down below another favorite of mine that
because of the really really cold months
my skin is very dry like i have normal
to dry skin on a normal weather day but
on a cold day my skin is very dry so
there's a bunch of things that i have
that are really targeted towards dry
skin first thing being dry all of your
body that's where this thing comes in
this is by soap &amp;amp; Glory this oh I just
got in my mouth so this is what it is
this is what it is this is the cream it
smells amazing it's their difficult soap
&amp;amp; Glory sent its thick which I really
like and I always like to apply this
after i get a spray time because you
really need to moisturize your skin and
this just works extra so when my skin
does get very dry this is what I turn to
all the time because it's just like an
extra boost of moisture onto my skin
love that for my body the next thing has
to do with my face so my face does get
very dry and I use a lot of moisturizers
and stuff which are very good i've
talked about that many times but the one
thing i do find helps is i do a mask
once a week and this new mask by origins
is great so this is called the drinkup
mask it's a 10 minute mask to quench
skins thirst that's what's called i've
been using this once a week i actually
have like a mask primer which i think
i'll talk about in another video if you
guys are interested but it just really
helps like enhance the mask and this is
what i've been loving lately so it just
helps replenish all the moisture into
your dry skin love this stuff has really
saved me a lot with like my snot scaly
I'm saying like drying skin I guess you
can kind of say scaly then moving on to
my scalp so my scalp gets very dry and
also very itchy because I don't wash my
hair every single day I actually wash
every four or five days which is kind of
insane but my hair can go a long time
without being greasy it's very greasy
right now because I'm probably going to
wash it tonight but when before I wash
it what I have been doing and in loving
is using this it spiked heels it's
called the magic elixir and what this is
is basically an oil that you just put
all over your scalp you massage it in
you wait around 20 to 30 minutes before
you shampoo and then you wash it out and
it really helps with dry scalp and its
natural ingredients there's no
harsh chemicals or anything so I really
like the fact that there's nothing bad
going on to my scalp and I do suffer
with very itchy scalp I know it's kind
of gross but there were literally you
flakes coming off sometimes in my
scratch it's so it's so gross I'm so
sorry but like that's just my skin
that's just what happens especially in
the winter I notice when I travel never
happens only back home then the dryness
of course goes on to my hair not that
has anything to do with my skin but I do
have very dry hair so i have been using
this product a lot lately it's called
the perfect ending leave-in conditioner
by e salon love this stuff i use a bunch
of their products but the leave-in
conditioner one has been a favorite of
mine right now just because of how dry
my hair has been so it's been a few days
now that i've actually washed my hair so
it does look very dry and brittle but
you should see it after i use this it
feels so great now I have three makeup
beauty products that I want to talk
about so the first one it being this
won't being this it spiked heels it's
called the micro olas french it's called
the micro blur skin Perfector Isis stuff
kind of like ass like a makeup primer
not all the time because i'm very lazy
but i do use it once in a while and I do
notice a dramatic difference my
foundation does stay a lot longer it
gets rid of my like not imperfections
but I do have like little acne scars and
stuff all over here you can't really say
on camera in person you can see and this
just helps blur it like it just helps
completely make my pores look smooth I
don't really like it it's expensive but
it's lost me a very long time you don't
need a lot of it at all you kind of just
rub and press it into your skin then a
foundation I've been loving is this one
by L'Oreal it's called the Umi the True
Match Lumi foundation I really like it
because it's just a super blendable it's
more of a medium coverage so you can
double it up to make it more full
coverage but I just usually just do once
all over my face lens very easily it
looks very natural this is a dark shade
because I came back from Hawaii it's not
too thick and it's not too runny it's
like the perfect in between and it's
drugstore so it's inexpensive I've just
been really liking it at the moment the
last thing I want to talk about was
actually something that was sent to my
p.o box and I showed this in my vlog at
my Valentines Day get ready with me
video talking like raving about these
lipsticks but basically they are bike
cosmetics it's a
Boosh this is not a sponsored video guys
like I swear this was just sent to me
and I tried it out and it's amazing so
in the box which is all black you get
all these lipsticks so first of all
packaging is like totally what I love
it's a matte dark grey color it's so
nice and the colors are amazing so I
used honeycomb in my Valentines Day get
ready with me video it's like a perfect
nude kylie jenner nude love it and this
is the one I'm wearing today so this is
called chai couch I and it's just like a
dark I mean you can see on my lips right
now but it's like a dark nude rose color
which is so flattering I love it and
what's great about these lipsticks I
don't know much about them to be honest
I didn't even know some someone said in
my comments at their Canadian then
someone said they're from New York I
don't really know correct me if you guys
know where they're from because I don't
know anything about these products but
they are just amazing lipsticks match
beautiful the colors are incredible
there's also this color that's just so
nice it's like a purple like how cool is
that there's a dark red oh my god this
the lasting power of these lipsticks is
insane their match but they're not
drying they're very moisturizing and
they lost for so long so I'm just very
happy with this this is like my absolute
favorite at the moment and there's like
such great colors so I'm just going to
be bringing this around me everywhere so
I think that's all my favorites at the
moment there's nothing else that's it
like that stands out to me I was I
looked through everything and I was like
