my
I have this like weird piece of hair
that I don't know if it looks good here
if I should put it behind and it's like
kind of annoying me I don't know what's
up guys welcome back to my channel I am
so excited right now well I was excited
yesterday because it was like the first
day of like real summer weather it was
like super warm outside and it was sunny
and happy and today it's raining and
cold also got cold to be honest I really
like the rain anyways I'm getting
sidetracked but I have been getting so
many requests lately to do an updated
workout routine and I kind of put this
on the backburner just because I felt
like my workout was basically the same
thing and I didn't want the videos to be
so repetitive but I do switch up my
routine every time it's like a different
season or come on vacation or not and if
you guys don't know my boyfriend
actually is very into like fitness and
health and he did want to be a personal
trainer for a while so he is really good
at working out I guess and he was a
competitive swimmer for a very long time
so he has really good exercises because
swimming isn't just always in the water
you do other things too but what I
decide to do in this video is a little
bit different than just a typical
workout routine where I just kind of
like show you what are you to workout
and just everything like that I kind of
wanted to combine it with things that I
like to do before and after I workout
just to kind of switch up the type of
video because I feel like I don't want
to make it so repetitive and if you are
curious to see exactly what I do when I
workout that will also be in the video
so I just don't know I want to make it a
bit different and if it works out well
for you guys maybe I'll do more okay so
one thing I want to talk about before I
get into everything is just to state
that I don't work out to look a certain
way like that's not the reason why I
exercise I know a lot of people think
that that's like the reason why most
people exercise is to like look really
good bikini body bla bla bla like yeah
it's that's great you know people want
to do that that's fine I literally have
nothing against it but me personally I
believe in like working out and being
healthy for yourself to like extend your
lifespan and that's like really what I
think of when I'm like exercising and
being healthy and to be completely
honest I go through waves all the time
it's you
Rimal you know one's always going to
feel motivated 100% of the time and
that's why I'm really grateful to like
have a boyfriend that's super super
motivated because it helps me be
motivated so number one reason why I
workout obviously is to live longer
because the more healthy you are the
longer you're gonna live I mean
obviously touchwood there's no accident
or disease or whatever you know but you
want to extend your chances as much as
possible you don't want to do anything
to your body that's going to cause harm
that's going to cause you to like
shorten your life span I want to live as
long as possible that's just how I feel
and I think by exercising and having a
proper diet is definitely going to help
with that I just think that by staying
active and eating a balanced diet is
probably like the best thing anyone
could do just for themselves personally
and I know that there's so many other
struggles and things you deal with and
maybe I could make a whole other video
about that but like it's not easy
obviously to try to be consistent is
hard but really like I always think of
it like that like I want to live long so
I'm just gonna be exercising anyways
this just getting so deep and like so
into it and I just don't want this video
to be so long so I'm just gonna get into
it right now there's one like really
important thing when it comes to working
out for me and that is water water is
not just important when you're working
it's important all the time but I drink
so much water throughout the day like a
bottle like this I drink so many of
these and the reason why I chose this
ball to show my videos because um of the
straw in it I know it's like such a
weird thing but I love to drink from a
straw like even if I have glasses like
big mason jar glasses I love straws I
just find I drink a lot faster that way
than just like drinking this way I don't
know I feel like I like can't drink
properly that way I'm weird something
like this is just very convenient and
also makes it really easy to drink a lot
of water now something else that I've
been doing recently that's a little bit
weird and kind of like makes me
embarrassed to talk about on a video but
sometimes and this happens a lot when
you're a runner but your nipples can
actually get really like chafed I think
is the word um if you don't have like
the proper equipment or the proper
protector so if you are a runner to it
you'll know this but basically that can
happen so one of the products I've been
using a lot lately too
with that is actually a lip off this is
so weird
okay so this was sent to me a while ago
and it's the Gloucester Mint bomb.com
lip balm which is basically like a
Vaseline consistency and I usually just
put it on your finger and you put on
your lips which works amazingly but I
find this works so good on like dry
patches
so like elbows and heels and like when
my hands get really dry here from like
if I'm lifting weights or whatever it
works on that but on my nipples I'm
working really well and it doesn't chafe
that is so embarrassing I can't believe
I'm saying this on the internet but that
is the thing that I've been dealing with
so another thing that's like I guess
somewhat embarrassing but not really cuz
everyone deals with this is like
smelling I mentioned this in a vlog that
I actually have a deodorant that works
really well that's why I don't smell bad
when I work out and a lot of people
asked what it was so I figured I would
just throw this in the video it is the
secret deodorant this one is the outlast
extend technology and clean lavender and
so it's actually like a gel formula but
I also have one that is like a non gel
formula so it looks like this and I
really really like the feeling of this
it goes on a little bit like wet almost
but then it dries super quickly and what
I really like about it is that it stops
the odor before it starts so if you put
it on like before you workout and before
like the beginning of the day when you
first wake up or after you shower
whatever it like is long lasting so you
won't smell at all throughout the day
and even during my workouts and stuff
I'm sweat a lot it I'm not like a person
that isn't sweat like I sweat a ton and
I don't smell and I can tell when I
smell so something like this is perfect
for that just because it just lasts all
day and you don't have to worry about
stinking when you uh you know go for
your workout then another essential when
I'm working out is music so headphones
and music I love to wrench like really
crazy plays playlists play lists I've
been loving Spotify lately I have an
account but I don't ever post anything
on it I just like follow different
playlists but if you guys are curious of
me making a Spotify account I could
totally do that as well yeah lately I've
been loving to listen to like throwback
music when I'm running
and if you can't tell by like a few my
videos I've been putting a few like
throwback songs and I just like really
like that so I'm just I'm just into that
it's like nostalgia makes me happy and
there's nothing better than listening to
good music when you're working out you
feel so like inspired and like oh okay I
feel like I'm really really rambling and
I'm sorry for those of you that like
don't care about this kind of stuff can
skip forward if you want but I suggest
not because talking about some real
important things here people next is a
Sports Bra that's gonna help with
supports they're like super cute so one
of my favorites right now is this one
this is from horses foam this is from
aloe yoga actually and it's just a
simple sports bra with like a strappy
back and it's super cute and it has this
like really nice mesh material on it
over here and I just find like sports
bras or just they just look so cute
and then another essential of course our
running shoes these are my running shoes
at the moment they're just all-black a
six or a six how do you pronounce it
basics a six anyways I had old Nikes I
was running with and I was always
getting shin splints and a ton of you
guys commented on my blog telling me
that I should try out
Asics because those are really good for
running on pavement and like running
outdoors and all that kind of thing all
that kind of all that kind of stuff so I
went to sports expert and ask the dude
if they had any because I thought like
all Asics were like so ugly like all the
colors but they weren't found these bad
boys and I love them and I have to say I
haven't really noticed that much of a
difference other than the fact that I'm
not getting shin splints which is good
but like they feel exactly the same as
Nikes so when I get back from working
out the first thing I like to do is
shower so I either just wash my body or
I like rinse my body or if I'm fully
showering washing my hair all that stuff
it's my favorite time to wash my hairs
after a workout just because I find I
feel so fresh afterwards and like
there's nothing better than that clean
feeling so I should have throw in some
of the shampoo and conditioner I've been
loving lately I've been loving lately is
this one from Pantene this is the
Pantene expert intense hydration shampoo
and conditioner and
says here that it instantly quenches
with moisture so it instantly quenches
your hair with moisture which actually I
can believe okay so I'm the kind of
person I have a really really dry hair
like just naturally also dying a blonde
doesn't really help especially coming
out of winter when my hair is just like
extra dry and living in Montreal where
it's like so cold so during this time a
year when I'm like working out a ton I'm
always outdoors and sweating a lot and I
wash my hair I like to like have
something that adds like extra moisture
like something more than your just
average like shampoo conditioner just
because I'm like really battling with
like coming out of the winter months
like I said and anyways this shampoo and
conditioner really does the job like to
be honest like it's crazy how fast it
works my hair instantly feels soft and
smooth after I wash it I didn't get so
many questions because now that I'm
vlogging everyday like every time I wash
my hair people are like oh my gosh did
you do something different it looks so
it looks so good looks so smooth and
like literally it's just my shampoo
conditioner that I'm using I'm doing
nothing different like literally nothing
different
it just looks and feels so good I also
really like the fact that they feel
really luxurious like that's something
that just makes me feel good cuz they
give a really nice lather and I just
feel like so good and the fact that
they're drugstore products as well is
amazing so now that I've rambled on a
tub and I'm just gonna get into my
workout routine and yeah you'll see what
I get to do when I work out and also
some really cool drone footage so I love
to run if you don't know that about me
yet then where have you been but running
is my form of therapy it relaxes me so
much so there's this like really cool
Park where I live or near where I live
and I love to run especially at this
time of year it's so nice outside so I
just go for a run on all the trails I
love to run down the hills up the hills
and it's just so beautiful and relaxing
for me to run in nature and just to see
feel like changing of the leaves the
flowers blossoming to hear the birds to
smell like a really fresh smell of
spring and I normally run around an hour
and I really just enjoy it a lot and
then normally at the end of my run I
like to sprint up the hills and this is
really good for your butt the back of
your legs your quads your thighs
everything like that it's really really
really good for you so I enjoy running
up the hills even though it's really
hard but you get stronger every day so
running is what I do to normally warm up
before I do any other core strength
exercises then I make sure I'm hydrated
like I said before of course always and
after that I like to kind of shake out
my body and stretch just a little bit to
kind of relax my muscles since they've
been you know working kind of hard and
sometimes my back gets a bit stiff when
I'm running for a long time so I like to
do this just to loosen everything up and
then I move on to my other exercises I
love to do step ups I usually start with
like one leg at a time and then I do the
other I'll usually do around like three
times 20 of everything that I do and
then I do jumps and this one you just
want to make sure that that you're
jumping with your whole foot onto the
plank
and push-ups this is the only form of
push-up I could do I can't do it on the
floor kind of a new girl push-ups oh
this is the struggle but I'm getting
better every day so I'm really happy
about it and then I don't know what this
is called but I like this and this this
is part of my ballet beautiful workout
so if you guys don't know from my other
workout video I do a lot of like ballet
stuff so I just find it works really
well and it tones the muscles and it
feels real good but your legs will feel
really weak afterwards just a warning
they burn and then after they felt like
jello and it's funny and this is a funny
one I don't even know if I do this
properly but I always laugh when I do it
and I just think it feels really good
Plus jumping jacks I used to do this as
a kid all the time so why not and then
going into my squats you guys know I do
daily squats but if you don't know
that's what I do so there's like
different forms of them I kind of like
to do plie squats they're fun so that's
what I do
and then moving on to ABS this is my
favorite ab exercise because it works
not only your abs but your whole core
and it's really hard so I do around 15
twice so 2 times 15 and then I kind of
just like not dance because this is not
like I'm so weak by this point it's
actually really funny and I just kind of
go crazy and then I trip and then I like
to stretch everything out and relax
usually just go on top of the mountain
work on my breathing and just look
around at the scenery in front of me and
just really appreciate my life and
appreciate what goes on around me and
set goals for myself and just be happy
and one with myself it's the best
feeling in the entire world
so I hope you guys enjoy this video it's
a little bit different than like the
typical workout routine I don't even
know if I want to title it workout
routine because it's not like just my
routine it's like other things I don't
know do you guys like these types of
videos I haven't been really doing like
favorites of the month anymore so I
figured I kind of like incorporate some
of my favorites for like different
trends so like workout favorites and
then like I don't know beauty favorites
and then hair freight I don't know like
I'm just thinking of so many ideas I
want to make my videos a bit different
than just like what they've been for so
long and I'm kind of trying to figure
that out so if you guys have any
suggestions really feel free to leave
