channel I'm actually sitting in a
different location today because I'm in
my bedroom and I'm using my vlogging
camera just because I really want to
make this a lot more personal not that
my big camera isn't personal I just feel
like that's a big production and I just
want to like sit here and talk to you
guys I don't know I feel like when I
watch videos a lot of times I feel like
it's more personal when someone does
something like this I don't know it
might just be me but that's what I'm
gonna do so I don't really know how to
start off this video because I just kind
of want to stay here and talk about a
few things and nothing bad if you follow
me out on any social media outlets like
Instagram Twitter snapchat anything you
will know that I was recently just in
Toronto I was there for the Pantene
Beautiful Lengths campaign and I got a
lot of questions about why I was there
and just like they want to know more
details if you guys don't know what that
campaign is I'll give it like a brief
summary basically it's to help women
that are going through chemotherapy that
have lost or their hair and that and if
you guys don't know what chemotherapy is
it's a treatment for cancer any type of
cancer and you know it's not just women
men can have it too basically the
Beautiful Lengths campaign and donate to
create are helping those who
unfortunately don't have the means for
you know purchasing a wig and I have
very close connection to cancer just
because I've had a lot of family members
passed away from it and it is very close
to my heart and I'm very passionate
about it I also have a friend who had
cancer when she was younger and it's
just one of those things that's just
really sad I would like to help out in
any way I could
so with this campaign basically what I
did was I went to raise awareness and
kind of see the people coming in they
made appointments at a hair salon and
they would donate their hair would help
those
who don't have the means like I said to
purchase a way cuz wigs could like
really good wigs could cost between like
twelve hundred two thousand dollars
something around that amount and you
don't know everyone has money to just
pay for that especially when you have a
lot of bills medical bills and etc
basically people can either donate their
hair or they can make monetary donations
and a hundred percent of the proceeds go
towards the actual making the wigs like
everything 100% it's not like they take
a bit of money for here that it's just
like everything you donate goes directly
to that and it helps women all across
the country get free wigs so that's
amazing because like it helps them feel
beautiful helps them feel normal they
can walk out in the street know how
people stare at them not that I think
you should stare but it's for the person
like putting yourself in their shoes it
must be really hard when you don't have
hair anymore to walk you know and just
try to have a normal life like I know
for me personally it would just be
really hard so I really want to help
with that I couldn't unfortunately
donate because my hair is bleached and
what you need to be able to donate your
hair if you guys are curious I'll leave
a link down below if you guys want to
send in your hair you can send it in
from all over the world it doesn't have
to be Canada or North America anywhere
in the world you can send in your hair
basically needs to be virgin hair so non
bleached or non treated and they need at
least eight inches so you can measure it
with a ruler and then you put the
elastic on top and you cut after that
and you can send it in so I'll leave the
link down below if you guys are curious
also if you want to make any monetary
donations completely up to you I'm not
trying to force you into it I just got a
lot of questions about this campaign and
I just really figured I would talk about
it the reason why I'm so passionate
about this is because my grandfather who
was also my best friend passed away from
cancer really quickly I also had my
dad's mother pound second cancer but she
unfortunately passed away right before I
was born so I never got to meet her but
my grandfather my mom's father was very
very close to me he was like my best
friend
basically my whole life I always looked
up to him so much and respected him and
you always think that like the people in
your life that are like strong men and
people that you love are just never
gonna get sick
cuz especially as a kid you don't think
that I don't know when he did get sick
when I was uh how old was I 20 I think
yeah or I was just about to turn 20 he
had prostate cancer which I didn't know
of I think my family like the adults not
that I wasn't adult but you know my mom
and my her brother and stuff they kind
of knew about it and the doctors were
just watching it and then basically it
spread like all over his body in within
three months he was gone so it was
really quick especially for me because I
found out right at the beginning of the
summer and then he passed away in
October and it was a really really hard
hard time for me and I just know that if
anyone's going through something like
what he went through and he was a really
healthy man really healthy so he was
still working he never retired and he
was still working out and being really
active I don't know so he didn't smoke
or anything like it was he was just a
really healthy guy so I know it can
affect anyone and it's one of those
things that if I could help in any way
somebody that's going through what he
went through I would love that whether
it be by monetary donations or donating
hair I just really thought I would
spread awareness because you guys are
like my friends and I told my friends
this and I feel like I want to tell you
guys about it no pressure just if you
guys want like if it's something that's
close to you and obviously a big reason
why these campaigns are given to people
like me is because I want to spread
awareness like I feel like I keep
repeating myself but that's basically
what it is like I'm just trying to
spread this campaign Pantene came out
with this campaign to help those so what
I'm going to do is I'm going to insert
some footage from when I was in Toronto
when I was at the salon with all the
women I got to meet so many amazing
people families people that work with
the Canadian Cancer Society and just
kind of get people's
experiences firsthand what it's like
donating the wigs having people's
stories on the other side receiving the
wigs and just all of that stuff so if
you curious to know then please keep on
watching
you
so amazing it's amazing already showed
up it's incredible and at this little
girl and her whole family from two
parents and was a little baby couldn't
donate her hair but so it was amazing
they all donated they had really long
hair the father had hair all the way
down to his hips he was saying and
afterwards who they were holding it all
of them she was so cute and it was just
amazing that this whole family did
together and it was incredible so I do
want to talk about a few things because
I do get a lot of questions on social
media about like where the hair goes and
how you can donate how you can help how
you can spread the message and I thought
that was really important so I do want
to talk to someone I do want to ask you
a question oh by the way guys this is
Kim so you actually work for the good
and I do and so I get a lot of questions
about like where the wigs go it's wrong
great yeah and how we can kind of spread
the message
explain in more detail so today for
national generate your hair day we're
getting a quick glimpse at how the
process works you can do this any day of
the year so convention once you have
your 8 inches or more yes wash it dry it
tie it off cut it off don't eat it ok
and then those donations go to make
grill hair wake stupid 8 details to make
curly hair way wow so the efforts of 8
people in every ways that you see yeah
about $1200 Wow and through this panty
beautifully and we're giving out for
these wakes recharged oh so those going
to cancer right across the country and
they're housed in our weave rooms that
are resonating Cancer Society offices
all across Canada I get emotional about
it yeah I've had the pleasure fitting
some people for wigs that are cancer
some of them donate their hair before
they lose it got and then they receive a
wig we had a conversation with that
woman by the name of Roseann so she's
donated for the last 10 years 10 times
and now she was just diagnosed yes sir
so she wants to donate one more time and
then be able to empower wait I also want
to show the actual whoops oh yeah I wig

it feels amazing real hair that's never
been treated never been colored and you
say this is eight people that go into
making at least yeah eight wow that's
amazing and you can have different lanes
and different styles of assuming Pantene
