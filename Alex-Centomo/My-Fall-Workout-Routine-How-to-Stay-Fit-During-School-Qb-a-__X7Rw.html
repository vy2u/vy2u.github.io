for me is just crazy it is so weird that
is been hailing outside I feel like fall
weather it shouldn't be snowing or
hailing or anything like that but what
can you do so I have been asking you
guys in a couple of my videos and also
on Instagram what kind of videos do you
guys would like to see and I get an
overwhelming amount of questions and
emails just about my fitness routine and
stuff and I do come out with like almost
a seasonal fitness routine for you guys
because I do like to switch up my
routine a lot actually
I'm the kind of person that I can't do
the same type of workout over and over
again I know a lot of people like that
because they like the same routine but I
get very not bored but I just feel like
I don't feel like things are working if
I'm constantly doing the exact same
thing so I do like to switch it up a lot
which tends to make good videos for you
guys so why does it look orange right
there I'm just hoping to help you guys
out as much as I can and show you guys
what I have been loving this is actually
quite interesting this video because I'm
the type of person that I workout rain
or shine or snow or whatever the weather
may be which lately has been hail so you
will see that in this video when it's I
mean when it's minus 40 outside I
probably will not be working outside
I'll usually work out inside but you
know we're not there yet guys we're not
there yet anyways before we get to this
video just a little side note I'm gonna
go into a little bit of an explanation
about something before I get into the
actual workout routine so just a warning
for you guys I'm gonna be talking for
like two minutes before the video but I
just I really want to stress that I am
in a no way of professional I just need
to put it like a little disclaimer out
there that just because I do something
doesn't mean that that's like the right
way to do it and that you need to do it
that way or my workout routine is better
than somebody else's I'm just showing
you guys what I love to do and things
that work for me and my body type and
also just a reminder that I was an
athlete my whole life I was a
competitive swimmer for ten full years
so I do have a lot of I guess
professional background if you're new to
it you should just kind of go at your
own level don't feel like you need to go
at my level anyways that being said
another quick thing I want to talk about
if you follow me at all on snapchat you
would have seen me talking about this
app that I've been using because I don't
like using machines or equipment when I
work out sometimes like once in a while
I like to use like a skipping rope or
whatever but I don't actually like to
use actual equipment because for one I
don't I'm a member at a gym and two I
just can't be Daniels guests at his gym
every single time so I have been using
this app called sworkit
which I don't remember how I discovered
it exactly
probably Instagram decided to test it
out and I actually really really enjoy
it and so I feel like it's something
that I want to share with you guys
before the video so there's a few
specific things about the app that I
really enjoy for one you can actually
pick apart on your body that you want to
work out and how long you want to work
out for so let's say I want to do like
core let's say I want to do but or legs
or something I can actually pick a part
of the body that I really want to work
out that day and it'll give me a bunch
of exercises for that specific area of
my body which is way better than me
having to search up a million different
videos on YouTube which is what I used
to do so you can choose between five to
sixty plus a minute like strength
training yoga Pilates stretching
workouts and there's no equipment needed
so you can decide between which kind of
workouts you want and then with those
workouts you will actually get a video
of an actual personal trainer doing the
routines showing you how to do it giving
you cues and instructions and all that
kind of stuff
you can actually customize your own
workout or you can just choose a
pre-made workout for you I usually to
customize mine just because I like to
mix and match all the time but the one
I've tried the pre-made once before and
I really like them as well plus is
available in like 30 different languages
including audio so that's amazing and
then the best part about it all because
I'm a huge fan of music you can actually
connect your Spotify account to it so
that way you can listen to your
playlists and stuff I have a Spotify
account but it's private because I'm
sometimes embarrassing with my music
decisions maybe I'll make a public one
day I don't know
but I really like that because I do have
specific like workout playlist so I can
connect it to the app and then I can
just listen to those playlists while I'm
working out and it's amazing so if
you're interested in checking out this
app at all I'll have a link for it down
below in the description where you guys
can check it out and see if you like it
or whatever and let me know down in the
comments if you do end up using it
because I'm curious to know what you
guys think anyways longest intro ever
I'm so sorry guys but I'm gonna get to
the video in 3 3 3 2 1 whatever I'm
weird so starting off my workout by the
way look at the weather guys just look
at it but I'm happy right lately I have
been loving skip rope this reminds me of
elementary school I was on the jump rope
team I forget what it was called but I
took it seriously we like had
competitions and stuff but I just think
this is fun way to do cardio
sometimes I jump higher sometimes lower
and I just like listening to music and
have so much fun and then I try to do
cool tricks like that and fail miserably
then I do some squats and then recently
I've been doing this thing where I like
lie back and bring my body upright and
balance there I know my body looks
contorted but I promise you this is like
really good for you and then I slowly
bring my legs down so that they're like
90 degrees and then back up you want to
try and really squeeze your abs when
you're doing this and it works the lower
abs so well like oh my gosh they're
burning right now then I do some pike
ups I used to do these all the time when
I was swimming and they of course work
your abs and stuff and then this is
another ab and leg exercise and just
obsessed with doing them this one's kind
of weird I did it a bit fast but you
really want to focus on going up and
then standing up straight and if it's
too hard for you then you can do it a
bit more controlled and then this thing
I got recently sent to me and I thought
it was so funny I don't I don't even
know if I'm like doing it right but I
decided to test it out with Daniel and
he kind of told me to like bring my legs
out and do a squat and I have to say it
actually really really hurt like not in
a bad way like I was burning the next
day so much but it was fun and then I
started acting like a crazy person
because oh my gosh I can't believe I'm
putting this on the internet right now
Wow and then it's time for stretching
because stretching is so important so I
just I'm doing some stretching that I
got from the app different methods and
stuff and I don't know just being weird
and trying to do flat A's and failing
miserably because of the frickin ground
and then this is another stretch I saw
on the app which I used to do this all
the time as a kid and now I just I feel
like my workout for the fall right now
is just like everything I used to do as
a kid and then guys check out the Hale
I'm not joking when I tell you that it
was hailing outside during the fall this
is crazy I was doing some exercises this
on the app Dan was helping me with them
of course but it was hard cuz look look
at this look what I have to live in
right now but don't worry guys because
this did not stop my motivation I'm
serious
so I hope you guys can take a little bit
from this simple video and apply it to
your workout or to your life or I just
hope it gets you motivated to actually
get up and move and do something because
even if you don't want to work out or go
for a run or do something even going for
a walk it's amazing just being active is
so good for you
long-term as well I don't always think
about like what something could do for
me in the in the meantime or something
that is good for me in the moment I
always think long-term and think for my
health especially for my insides what
will be best for me in the future
because I'm gonna thank myself when I'm
older I'm gonna thank my current self
for doing what I'm doing now because I'm
just preparing my body to be healthy for
the rest of his life if you would like
different types of videos more fitness
videos I don't know I want to come out
with like all these videos for you guys
but I don't know what you guys want like
what types of fitness videos do you want
do you want more like healthy videos
more like what I eat I don't know I want
to please all of you because I know I I
feel like my channel is definitely
becoming like more lifestyle there's
definitely still the fashion and beauty
involved in hair of course I'm never
gonna stop making those videos but I do
like to incorporate things I'm very
interested in right now so like travel
and lifestyle and all that kind of stuff
anyways I love you guys all so much

because you'll see my videos almost
every one
