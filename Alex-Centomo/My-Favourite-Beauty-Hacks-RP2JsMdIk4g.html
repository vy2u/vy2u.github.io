life and especially I guess my youtube
life like the time I've been on YouTube
I've found certain I guess you can call
them beauty hacks that basically I have
just copied through like Pinterest over
my years and things that I really do use
not on an everyday basis but things that
I find could be super helpful super
inexpensive just tips and tricks to like
do things that normally would take extra
time extra money all that kind of stuff
these tips I've kind of been talking
about a lot with my friends lately just
in my personal life and I figured why
don't make a video about this because I
feel like it could benefit a lot of you
it's benefited a lot of them and myself
so why not share that with you guys I
kind of just compiled a list in my like
little notebook here I got for my
birthday of things that I really do
think work because I think that show
nothing they're just things that I think
are so important for not just beauty
because I feel like beauty such a good
stereotypical word more help because I
do feel like health plays a part in
beauty beauty on YouTube meaning like
makeup hair care all that kind of stuff
so the first thing I wrote down is
drinking water drinking water is so
important for so many different reasons
it has benefits to literally everything
in your life sleeping your health
everywhere I mean your body is made up
mostly water so why not hydrate yourself
your skin your hair your eyes your heart
everything water is so important and
there's also benefits to drinking water
at different times in the day like I
learned years ago probably when I was
swimming there drinking two glasses of
water when you wake up is really good to
help start up your organs and stuff in
the morning and I've been doing that for
so long sometimes I add lemon and stuff
but drinking like a big mason jar of
water or two regular glasses it's like
the perfect thing to do first thing when
you wake up after you brush your teeth
and wash your face also drinking a cup
of water before eating can really help
with digestion and I usually drink a cup
of water before i go to bed but
sometimes i don't because then i like
wake up before him have a new to the
bathroom so it really depends along with
drinking a lot of water is working out
kind of on a regular basis I do think
being active plays a huge part in your
overall health and well-being when I
exercise I just feel so much better I
find my skin is better my hair grows
faster I feel so much more energized
throughout the day I sleep better at
night I just feel really good inside and
I work out to feel good on the inside I
don't work out based on my looks at all
I do not ever do that and I don't think
that that's something that I want to
promote you guys I think working out in
general is more of just like a lifestyle
on making healthier choices in your life
I've always been very active so it's
it's just something that I enjoy doing
sleep is also very important for your
health that's why working out drinking
water is just going to help you sleep
better sleeping this is my thing
sleeping from 10pm to 6am is like the
perfect time to sleep I don't remember
who exactly told me this it was a while
ago but I've been doing this for a long
time going to bed at ten waking up at
6am it gets you the most productive in
your day and sometimes i'll sleep until
seven go to bed at eleven whatever but
like normally i fall asleep at 10 and it
just works really well for me now i want
more beauty hacks these are things that
I think are super affordable and just
really good so the first thing I have to
say is using honey on like a blemish on
your face I know this is kind of random
but I have been doing this for a while
now I used to have friends that put
toothpaste on their pimples but I wanted
something that was like leche leche I
wanted something that was less chemical
e if that makes any sense more like more
natural so I use organic honey by the
blemish I just put a little bit on the
blemish cover it with a bandaid and
sleep on it or just cover it with
something and then overnight the blemish
will be gone really depends if it's
cystic acne like the really big one I
don't think that would work but little
blemishes here and there it'll work fine
and it's obviously very inexpensive and
no harsh chemicals another thing I find
super important our hair masks now your
masks are just a savior for me
especially if you color your hair or use
heat on your hair you have damaged hair
I just love hair masks in general you
guys know I try out so many different
types of hair masks but the one I've
been loving I guess for the past few
months I've shown it on
like my Instagram before and stuff and
I've talked about in vlogs but it's this
one by Brie ogio I really like it
because there's not a lot of harsh
chemicals like it says here all the
bottom no parabens no silicones and no I
don't know how to pronounce this but
basically if you can't pronounce the
word it's not good for you it also says
in it is rosehip avocado and argan oils
and intensely repairs in nourishes we
care I agree with this hundred percent
is for all hair types no matter what
your problem is damaged hair from heat
damaged hair from dying it's good for
all hair types and it just leaves your
hair feeling so soft and just
replenishes all like the the dryness I
feel like I talk about hair all the time
on my channel but seriously it's
something that I find very important
because i think when somebody has
healthy hair they just seem more healthy
and I don't know for me and I find with
my friends to we just we find being
healthy such an attractive quality and
so important I always think for the
future and you know I see like my
parents saying oh I wish I did this when
I was younger I wish I did that when I
was younger it's like why not just do it
now why not just take care of your body
your body is so important obviously if
you want to live a long healthy life you
gotta keep it healthy that's that goes
with everything so once the insides your
body are healthy to help with the
outsides I think hair masks are a great
alternative and especially deep
conditioning masks are great also this
smells really good mmm it's like it
smells like vanilla mixed with like a
flower and I know that's not what this
scent is supposed to be but to me that's
what it reminds me of it smells so good
and your hair smells great for the rest
of the day i also have a coupon code for
you guys for this product if you guys
want to check it out I'll leave the down
in the description we can also click the
link and check out the product I don't
have it right here for you guys if you
do try it out let me know what you think
tweet me or on instagram i love when you
guys if i recommend something to I love
when you guys test it out and let me
know how you like it next on list so as
you guys know I just came back from
Turks and Caicos and before that I was
in Hawaii and I always get spray tans
before I go away on a trip just because
I don't like to just like lay out in the
Sun and just hope to get a tan
so that it'll look good in pictures i
just got a spray tan and that way i
talked a while that much in the sun and
damaged my skin blah blah blah so the
spray tan I go to you guys all know it's
all vegan natural gluten-free really
good for you but the problem is when I
get back from vacation and my spray tan
starts to fade I love my dark foundation
I love being a little bit more tend so
when it starts to fade I don't want to
have to go out and buy a pale foundation
I'd rather just like use up the one
already have so a trick I've been using
I don't know if this is even like legit
like is this post it anywhere but I just
like did it once and it worked so if you
add your face cream to the foundation
actually lightens it up especially if
it's like white like this face cream i
have is really white so mixing that with
the foundation you can do two steps in
one and also it lightens your foundation
so that way you can like match it to
your skin obviously the more cream use
the lighter is going to be that way you
don't have to go out and buy a whole new
foundation for when you get paler so
this is the one I use in the summer and
I just stick with this one and I just
keep going another thing I have
discovered quite recently actually is
putting your mascara in your bra for
like five minutes before you use it just
to warm it up and this actually makes a
foundation go on flawless and helps it
curl and last like all day long it's so
weird but it really works so this is the
mascara I'm talking about by covergirl
it's called the plum puffs I and it's
one of my absolute favorites at the
moment as you can see here it's a really
thick wand and stuff and it's already
great on its own but seriously putting
it in your like bra or like just in your
shirt like right here from like three to
five minutes before just helps it like
intensify its crazy i don't know why but
it just works so definitely try that out
next thing dry shampoo is a huge must
for me i'm wearing it now and i don't
think i actually like blended it in
properly because i'm kind of rush but
basically um you guys know I work out on
a daily basis I maybe take one day off
but that's just like I still do
something active on that day like I go
rock climbing or biking or walking or
something I just don't go to the gym or
do like my normal workout routine which
means that my hair gets very greasy
because I sweat a lot when I work out
but I don't want to wash my hair that
often because washing your hair off
is actually not good for you so dry
shampoo is a lifesaver I bring it with
me everywhere I really like the bumble
and bumble 1 i've been using it for
years and I just find it just gives my
roots like a bit of like a lighter color
which is nice because I have blonde hair
and it just works really well and gives
it that volume and looks brand new and
it's it's not that bad cuz right now my
hair is super super greasy like I don't
know if you guys could tell it's been
like four days I've been washed it now
obviously I still shower I just don't
wash my hair if you do wash your hair
when you get out of the shower I do
suggest using either like a very
lightweight soft cloth or just an old
t-shirt to dry your hair and you don't
want to like rub it like that and that
causes it to break and everything like
that so what I do is I just wrap it up
in like a little trip in on top of my
head I wait for it to be like eighty
percent dry I take the t shirt or the
cloth off whatever you're using and then
you just let it air dry the rest of the
twenty percent and I just gives it a
really nice like volume curl at least
for me that's what I have when I was
younger I had like ringlets like
literally Shirley Temple hair it was
like afro and my hair would be dry
instantly as soon as I got of the shower
so if yours like that that's great
because you don't got to worry about
drying your hair but I don't suggest
hair dryers another really weird thing
that I have been doing recently
especially because I've been traveling
and sometimes that you get sunburned um
if you guys all know what aloe vera is
very important for if you do get a
little bit of a burn which obviously you
got to wear your sunscreen but in case
you do get a bit of burn putting some
aloe into like ice cube trays and
freezing them is so good because you
take off the little and once they're
frozen you take out the little frozen
aloe gel thing and you just rub it on
your burn and it feels incredible and it
just takes away that burning feeling
like instantly it feels amazing so
definitely try that out especially if
you're going on vacation or if it's
summer for you guys or you just you know
just keep that in mind write these down
another really weird thing is um putting
some perfume in your hair brush so this
is the perfume I'm using at the moment
and if you just spray a little bit in
your brush before you brush your hair if
you're smelling amazing all day is
really weird obviously you don't spray
too much because you don't want your
hair to
feel like gross but just a little bit
and you kind of brush through your hair
and it smells so great and every time I
like hugged Ann or somebody that look oh
you smell so good like thanks you know
another really great tip especially for
the winter and where I'm from it's so
dry here it's crazy but Vaseline goes a
long way for so many different reasons I
actually couldn't find it i'm pretty
sure it's like in my bathroom somewhere
and i just was too lazy to get it but
rubbing vaseline all over your feet and
then putting some thick socks over that
and then sleeping makes your feet feel
like a baby's butt when you wake up
really helps i suffer it for years with
really dry feet it's disgusting but
doing this has really helped a lot in
that department another great thing
coconut oil so this is a brand new
container we just got but I like to take
some from here scoop it into like a
little travel-size thing sorry that was
my phone and what I love about coconut
oil is it's really great for sunburns
but an moisturizing of course but also
to remove your makeup it's like so great
so and it's all natural obviously it's
just coconut oils so you just take a
little bit you rub it all over your face
you rinse it off and your makeup is just
like gone it's awesome I'm pretty sure
like a lot of people know this trick
though cuz I kind of see it everywhere
but it's just something that I love to
do and it's so inexpensive and my mom
buys these big ones at costco and then
we kind of all share it so it's great
last so long to another thing I love to
do for the lazy girl but if you're ever
using like if you have your hair and
like a clip or something like that or
you need to use bobby pins I'm spraying
them with some hairspray will keep them
set in place all day long or all night
long whatever you do so like whatever
you're doing so if you have like an
event or something that you to go to
which sometimes I'll do like I'll pin my
hair to the side behind my ear and I
don't want the hairs to be falling
forward so I spray my bobby pin with
hairspray I love this one this is the
Pantene air spray which is really great
it doesn't feel crunching your hair if
you actually do use hairspray and it
smells really great but it does have
such a strong strong strong hold with
bobby pins in your hair it's amazing so
I do recommend this it's from the
drugstore so it's very inexpensive it's
alcohol free which is very important
I just really love the way that this
kind of holds bobby pins in place
another Beauty hack i have is um holding
not holding but carrying around little
like face cleanser things in your purse
so I don't wear makeup on everyday basis
I don't recommend wearing makeup on an
everyday basis so on days that I'm
really not wearing makeup I do find that
my face just feels like this by like
midday to like evening it just feels
like gross I feel like I look in the
mirror and it's shiny it's just not that
pretty so I just like take out one of
these and wipe it over all over my face
and it feels like brand new and it
doesn't leave my face like sticky it
doesn't clog my pores it just kind of
washes off everything from your face and
makes it awesome so these are the olay
total effects seven in one wet cloth
cleansers wow that's a mouthful but i
will like these again very inexpensive
and you can just throw them in your bag
and I find like if I'm doing something
which I'm always kind of active and like
on the go these are great thing to have
just on you and sometimes I find myself
you know at people's houses and then I'm
there for a long time they're like oh my
face just feels so gross i'm gonna just
like the last Beauty hack I have I feel
like I've had so many but these are
things that I actually use like often um
if you're wearing a sweater that has
those little pills on them you know when
you're sort of gets like little pillay's
and stuff using a razor to shave them
off work so well I think somebody told
me this in one of my videos actually
because Dan had gloves that had like
pills all over them those are oh and i
just don't like looking at I don't know
why grosses me out it's like little
holes someone commented saying oh if you
like shave them it'll just take them off
and it worked so that's another tip for
you guys and that's another great thing
about YouTube is that like you guys give
me tips and me advice if you guys have
any other hacks beauty hacks help hacks

know in the comments down below i'm
curious and hopefully you can like help
