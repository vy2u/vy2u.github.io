that new hey everyone so I'm here today
with my monthly favorites of februari
2013 so basically what i'm going to do
in this video is just go over beauty
hair care skin care and just like other
products i've been loving for the month
of February's so things that i will
definitely repurchase and that i use
almost on a daily basis and that i would
definitely recommend to you guys because
i love them so much so yeah if you're
interested in seeing that stuff then
just keep on watching by the way my hair
is just not cooperating today so I
apologize if it looks a little weird but
ya gotta deal with that so yeah let's
get started so the first thing that I've
been loving for the month of februari is
the Maybelline at the rocket volume
Express mascara I love this mascara so
much it's so good it's one of those
really volumizing mascaras and it's from
the drugstore so it's not too expensive
what I like about this is that it's
really really buildable yeah buildable
so um I mean more coats you put on the
longer eyelashes get and it's just crazy
and I also really really really like the
wand on this cuz it's really nice and
big I normally go for more high-end
mascaras but I think this is the first
mascara I've found from the drugstore
that I actually really really really
like and that i will definitely
repurchase next thing i've been loving
is the Maybelline Dream lumi liquid-like
highlighter and concealer so it's just
like this I really like this through the
month of februari this one is in my
absolute favorite it works just as well
as mac and also highlights so I mean if
you underneath your eyes it gives you a
really nice broad I effect and opens up
your eyes and I just really like it so
its product you kind of just twist up
the bottom and the product comes up
through the bristles and you can just
apply it to your face and then rub it in
with your fingers so the next thing I've
been loving for the month of februari is
the Revlon nearly naked foundation and I
know in a bunch of my videos i've been
using
the blonde colorstay foundation but that
just gives more of a guess full coverage
look but this one for an everyday basis
is perfect because you barely feel it on
your face I mean it really feels like
you're naked like I do not feel the
foundation at all and it just really
really really blendable and I mean the
more you apply the more coverage you can
get so I just like to apply one coat but
I just love this foundation so much so I
would really recommend going again going
to get ours I primer and this I found by
missglamorazzi on YouTube and I love
this so much because um I have really
really really oily eyelids and I mean no
matter what I primer I used to put on
and would just like leak and run off my
face and crease and it was just so
annoying because I mean my face isn't
too oily I have combination to oily skin
but my eyelids for some reason they just
get really oily so this stuff is perfect
it stays on all day and does not crease
and it keeps my eyelids nice and pat
ified throughout the day so I have just
been loving this for the whole month
lately I've been loving MAC lipsticks
and I mean this has been a couple months
now that I've been loving MAC lipsticks
but for the month of februari I've been
loving two colors in particular and the
first lipstick that I've been loving is
a cream machine and it's called lickable
and it's what i'm wearing on my lips
right now it's a really really really
nice like reddish pink but it's really
dark and it has a blue undertone so I
mean it makes your teeth look a lot
whiter which I like so yeah I've been
loving this color for the month of
februari and then as well as this color
that I actually used in my twix left
wheeler and my Taylor Swift makeup
tutorial and it's just this really nice
nudey brown color and this is in the
color patisserie and it's a luster so
it's really really really creamy and I
mean you can almost wear this as a lip
balm and a lipstick it's so nice i love
it where eyeshadow i have been loving
the color would wink by mac it's a
really nice golden bronzy brown look
and I'm wearing it on my eyes on my
eyelids today and I just I've been
loving this color for an everyday look
it's so pretty and the last beauty
product that i have been loving is my
Urban Decay d slick setting spray and I
apply this before I put on any makeup
that I applied either after I apply my
foundation and concealer or at the end
of my makeup look like today I sprayed
it on after this whole thing was
complete and it just keeps your makeup
on your face and just not go anywhere
all day you can hug someone you can
brush up against somebody and it does
not come off it's amazing it like I just
can't even say enough good things about
this product so for skincare this month
i have been loving my aveeno positively
radiant daily moisturizer with SPF 15 so
it's just like this and i mean i've been
using this Oh month and I applied every
morning after wash my face and I mean it
is important to apply some sunscreen
before you go go out into the Sun even
if it is winter because you know it's
still get you and you don't want to
cause any premature wrinkles so this
stuff is great it does not break me out
and I mean I do have combination to oily
skin so I do have dry patches and oily
patches and this does not make my skin
want more oily and just even so it all
out gets rid of that dryness and I think
it's really perfect through the winter
months especially because your skin is
extra dry but yeah I would really
recommend getting this product because
it is just amazin xed product that i
have been loving for skin care is my
bioderma toner and this stuff I swear is
amazing I have been loving this i
purchased this one in new york city in
december and i've been using it ever
since it is definitely one of my
favorite products to use basically what
i do with this is after i remove my
makeup at night time with my makeup
remover whenever I like to apply this
with a cotton ball all over my face and
it just gets off all the excess this
next product of mine has been a favorite
for a long long time probably around a
year but I kind of saw
using it the past couple months I don't
know why because when i started using it
again in February I like fell in love
with again and I mean I use it like
crazy and it is the soap &amp;amp; Glory daily
smooth body lotion I know they have with
the hand smoothie which is just for your
hands but this stuff is amazing soap &amp;amp;
Glory I swear to God their products are
unbelievable they smell so good like oh
oh my god it smells kind of like the
Coco Mademoiselle Chanel perfume and
it's just I mean I wish you guys could
smell this it's it's incredible I would
definitely recommend going to buy this
and not only does it smell amazing but
the product is awesome it's really nice
and thick so I don't know if you guys
could see this but it's thick and creamy
and it just like it spreads so much you
don't need a lot of product and it just
goes everywhere it's really creamy it
you know keeps your skin hydrated
throughout the whole day I put this on
my legs sometimes after i shower and by
the end of the night I still smell it
like its just oh my god I'm obsessed huh
sorry if I seem really weird guys like
I'm smelling this thing like getting
high off of it or something so I don't
have that many products for hair but
things that I picked up that we're new
this month and that i've been using
every single day well not every single
day but every single day i wash my hair
which is probably every second or third
day because um i don't find it good to
wash your hair every day I don't and I
don't really need to doesn't get oily
fast but it is the bumble and bumble
creme de cocoa conditioner and this
stuff is amazing I mean I know probably
said every single one of these products
is amazing but they are and especially
this one this is incredible you use like
the smallest amount possible and you
just rub it through your hands like this
and apply it to the ends of your hair
like you would normal condition er leave
it in for like a minute or two it's not
completely a hair mask I mean you can
use this as a hair mask but I like it as
a conditioner because it just really
hydrates your hair and oh my gosh what a
difference guys like my hair has been
has never felt to the smooth
normally like I wash my hair it feels
smooth maybe the first day this is like
until the next day I wash my hair my
hair is smooth and it smells like
coconuts which is like one of my
favorite scents ever it just reminds me
of Florida oh my gosh yeah so if you
don't like the smell of coconuts I
wouldn't recommend this because it does
smell strongly of coconut and like that
tropical smell but if you do like that
then I would highly recommend getting
this bumble and bumble they have crazy
good hair products and this one has just
been a lifesaver and I mean look guys
like I've been using this all month and
I'm barely use up any product that's
crazy next favorite i have on basically
out of because i've been using it for a
long time but is my amico amica oil
treatment and this is like argan oil and
moroccan oil all in one i got this at
sephora and this stuff is mmm it smells
so good it smells kind of like the
Betsey Johnson perfume I don't know if
you guys have ever used that perfume but
it smells a little bit like that and the
smell stays in your hair all day so I
mean after I wash my hair I will put
this in the end so when my hair is kind
of dumped not completely wet but damn i
will rub it through my hands like this
and pull it to my ends of my hair and it
just helps like keep them nice and
hydrated because my ends are very dead i
do dye my hair so it just helps keep it
healthy and it smells so good by the end
of the dams you I'll catch myself like
smelling my hair which is really creepy
but I don't care because it smells
really good Oh so for my random beauty
favorites i have my SE ballet slippers
and this is my all-time favorite nail
polish ever it's a really nice white
pink it's really like a really nice nude
color it's very sheer though so you
would need one or two coat will not one
coat two coats i would say two or three
but I mean sometimes I'll put one coat
and it just looks like a really nice um
nude look it doesn't look like I'm
wearing my scarf that i got from free
people in new york city i have been
wearing actually every single day since
i bought it in your
to summer but um since this is a
februari favorite I guess it is my
favorite favorite scarf and it's just an
American flag scarf like this it's
really big it's so soft and what I like
about this scarf is that I mean you can
wear it so many different ways and when
it's on it doesn't look like your wine
just like a huge American fly you know
it just it's really nice colors and I
like the fact that if you put on perfume
it the perfume sticks to the scarf I
mean whenever I catch myself putting my
scarf on and I get a whiff of that
perfume I'm just like them it smells so
good and then of course i have my panda
hat because i love pandas there are the
cutest little creatures ever and when
you see people wearing this on the
street you're kind of like what are you
doing but for me I'm like so cute and I
love ears I just gravitate towards any
hat okays like ears or face or anything
really cute okay so now for my kind of
favorite that shouldn't really be my
favorite because it's not good for you
but I am in love with mini eggs and I
just got this from bought Barnes I don't
even care that they're not healthy I
love these and yeah judge all you want
but they're amazing and I do not care
they're so good and of course my last
favorite is stitch this has been with me
since I was 11 years old and lilo and
stitch came out my mom had gone to the
Disney Store and um where was it Toronto
or something she told me that when she
went into the disney store with her
friend who was buying toys for her like
