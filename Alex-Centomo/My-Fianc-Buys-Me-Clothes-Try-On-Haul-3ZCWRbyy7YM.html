should cut you should bring you a chair
further back so you don't look as big
like no shorter babe oh what's up guys
welcome back to my channel I'm with Dan
what's up you guys know him by now
so I've wanted this video for a while
because I've seen it all over YouTube
and I always laughed so hard when I
watch it either like they're really good
or they're like not that great but I
have a feeling you're gonna do good it's
the boyfriend buys my clothes it's like
a challenge I guess I don't know but
he's my fiance I don't know maybe I
bought the right stuff maybe not if I
bought the wrong stuff then this will be
funny if I brought the right stuff then
it'll be good did you fart no I'll hold
it and then you can take things out one
at a time okay well show the bag how big
it is it's pretty big
I'm excited how many things did you get
I think I bought nine things you know my
style really way eight or nine things
should I just hand you things one at a
time where do you want to pick oh I
shall see makes love to me my god you
picked up first things first I kind of
bought this not as a joke but like -
various big puffy bastard clothes oh not
really an outfit but I know you love
those so I thought you'd like it my god
this feels like the softest thing in the
entire world and it's a size large oh
it's so fluffy is it actually soft yeah
oh god damn it is wow that's so nice
okay well off to a great start like it's
not really an outfit but okay you guys
this is the softest house room I've ever
owned good yeah yeah oh my god it's
really soft and it has a big hood oh how
good is that gonna be up to your bath
how good is it right now go downstairs
and put on a fire and watch a movie yeah
this is so soft what the heck I even
like it do you want one no no I don't
like heaven rose so this is what it
looks like this is so comfy do you like
it yeah it's really nice you have so
many we what is this it's like open on
the show I've actually never worn
sweater with holes in the shoulder so I
have no idea what that would look like
on me but I mean gray sweater that's
less that's why I picked agree I don't
know I love a gray sweater this is not
the one I wanted but it's still super
soft but I stretchy I picked it cuz it's
kind of oversized like I don't know it's
like see how wide it is it's more for
the fall plus I know you like gray
sweaters and it was big I can't wait to
try this this is a really good material
- what like brand is this this is
fashioned same same as the weird it's
too big is this it's too big because
this should be a little tighter so that
your shoulders actually come out but for
you it's like it's too big let's look at
how boxy it looks down here yeah but I
don't care cuz it's soft wait guys it's
too big it should be in like that but
I'm looking help you take it in the one
thing I have to say is with open
shoulders because I have broad shoulders
it makes me look more broad so that's
usually why I steer clear of that but
you didn't know I didn't know that that
scared us I feel like if my friend could
sew this then I would still wear it I
don't care
it's the cube Oh dad yeah yeah sorry I
think you could fit you better it would
be nicer it's like
kind of boxy but it's so freakin coffee
it feels like a stretchy blankie feel it
yeah it is this really soft it's nice I
think this would be cute with a skirt
and tights
we got the t-shirt for this event like a
shirt no I didn't buy a new main thing I
was going to but they didn't have
anything nice no like for the deal oh
that's cute kind of cropped I don't know
about the size well graphic that's good
babe yeah that nice yeah yeah yes it
looks really big but in all honesty like
oversized shirts you can't really go
wrong in them yeah this is cute I think
it's look really simple no just a simple
heart oh it kind of sticks out do it
that's it's a little raised yeah I like
that and I guess this is just yeah this
is just the ASOS brand well that's cute
dad I think this was just like a leather
jacket or like oh my gosh that's why I
was thinking simple nice the fit is a
little strange like it's nice in some
places but not in others like tight on
my shoulders but then a box yeah and I
feel like honestly I could tie it to be
like yeah and if you're wearing a
leather jacket oh yeah like I can make
it work yes I would give this more like
a 7 on 10 yeah if it's at 5 it fit
better it would be nicer yeah but I
thought you'd like the little simple
kind of dainty heart thing you know I do
I thought that would look pretty cool
I don't remember what this is oh it
feels weird
oh I don't remember that it honestly I
mean it's not bad yeah I don't remember
this
I get seconds my awful obviously I mean
it's a simple white Nick yeah the only
thing I'm worried about is it's an
awkward length it's like not long but
it's not well we'll see what it's like
when you try it on yeah just really what
it's bad it's kind of soft though it's
soft but like scratchy that makes any
sense that makes no that doesn't mean I
know what you mean but okay I gave that
I gave everything else I give them the
rope ten on ten gray sweater
I give like a nine on 10 the graphic I
don't know how it fit so I guess I'm
nine on ten we'll see this I give like a
seven on ten just cuz I'm not in love
with the material but or maybe like an
eight on ten because I really like it
and I think this would be cute with like
brown boots you know and I thought I
couldn't match with some nice fall stuff
you know
yeah I don't like this product though
because it's tight you it goes I'm like
I don't know why but like when things go
halfway around my butt yeah but what if
you just like what if you just pulled it
up a little bit like that I guess yeah
and I like the fact that they're long I
love when sweaters you're kind of moving
kinda put your hands in it yeah I like
that and there it's not too tight
anywhere else this is actually really
nice I think that fits you really nice
yeah this is essentially what it looks
like this is cute
not bad I like are you checking out my
butt no I'm checking you like oh how it
fits you
pretty color I thought it was good for
fall yeah which is coming up hey you
guys dad's here he just got a haircut
literally today looks great that's
product in it which I don't really don't
do oh this is different yeah it's like
kind of rolled sleeve like rolled
already yeah I mean you could enroll it
but I like this I thought the color
would look good on you
yeah oh this is nice oh it's navy blue
it's like navy blue and pink like beige
pink I know this I'd give look at 9 on
10 because it's not as over sizes I love
this is nice
might be a tad small I don't know it's
just a little tighter than you usually
wear your phone was but I don't think
it's tight well I would just I would
just know this is like totally fine yeah
cuz I like to have it kind of open oh
that looks good oh this is so cute do
you like the color I love the color
that's why I really love it too yay do
you like it yeah it looks good I think
it fits nice see yeah this would be
really nice to go like apple picking or
something in the fall you know carving
pumpkins or whatever yeah that's good
it's hard to know cuz like the t-shirt
looks way too big and I got a preacher
got the same size for that yeah but then
it's wide open okay these mom jeans I
had no idea what the right kind of Jean
was I just thought they looked cool so I
thought they would look good on yes rip
sorry I'm gonna like smack you nice I
don't know I think they're cut off at
the bottom a little here oh that's sweet
hope the size is good I have no idea I
have no idea what that size I think
that's I think that's what you told me
to get Oh is this when you're asking me
what you would be in european-- yeah
they didn't have normal sizes then UK
and Europe size this is the UK bread I
know this is nice I can't wait to try
this on I hope it fits but their mom
jeans are not supposed to be super tight
that's true but knowing my
Oh too tight get over my butt but these
are gonna be like sky jeans yeah that's
not how they're supposed to fit no it's
way too small too small
that's not how here's my step ahead wait
I mean jeans do stretch over time these
are not gonna stand there - way too
tight
dan I think they wouldn't look so good
if they were bigger how the heck do I
know my size I don't know I guess it
also depends on the brand but like yeah
but you'll have to look at the sizes
that's on this and know that you're
bigger I do know that you told me all
the jeans I did 32 long like the length
of em is 32 it's just it's the other
sizes yeah
oh I can give us - Kailah how many more
things it looks like after that is to
have a good jean shorts oh I think I got
one I got one pair of shorts in case we
have another few like hot days by the
brand glamour and I doubt we're gonna
have hot days but you can always use a
pair of shorts when I do I think the
buttons work - wrong with that I like
the bunch of these I think are gonna be
too small yeah they're look for really
something unless are they high waisted I
think so then your butt's gonna hang out
the back it's gonna look funny but
whatever I don't know guys she can't
even pull the black jeans off no no the
black shorts and they literally will
knock over my butt like you know I knew
you're gonna do my style that's
you know me so well because we go
shopping often and I'm always like I
hate that I need that I like that name
is that okay so this is the same size as
the blue jeans and okay this is the same
exact thing it's the same brand but it's
the mom jeans but this is rolled at the
bottom it's not cut the rips are
different too looks nice I don't want a
pair of black mom jeans so I'm really
excited ten on ten not sure if you were
definitely like it's hard but I know
pants for you it's hard because like
your legs are pretty long and then your
butt so it's hard to figure out your
sizes but like your waist is smaller so
you're like again the rate whatever in
all honesty and I love the wash black
look I think it looks super nice yeah I
know you like that kind of like washed
out that bigger than the shorts jeans oh
they are oh those fit how are these the
exact same size as those and these are
like big it's literally the exact same
look even like look they're too big yeah
they are but look at the back it's the
exact same size fergan massive they're
just try to my freaking ass but at least
they're they're more mom looking around
your legs yes
not with a belt oh yeah they're really
loose here but that's fine it's just
this is my issue always it's like loose
here tight here yeah it's because your
butt holes the jeans around your legs
really tell you and my legs are like
they're more like there's more meat of
them here and then this is like but it's
not as honest now at the end of the
world I just wonder if I could sit oh
yeah actually fit yay nothing which is a
lot
well the fact that you got a gray
sweater in there and a big fluffy
battery so Charlie what is this Oh Andy
does sweet I know you like that logo
yeah it's like kind of it once it's more
like distressed it'll look more vintagey
i could work out on this yeah do it I
love this oh my god you did amazing yeah
minute total I mean it's a baby I could
be cool with a GJ head over to this
would be cool the jean jacket blue one
you know it's nice though and it could
be a workout shirt too yeah that's what
I'm gonna use it for or like a sleeping
shirt I love this pattern my dad had one
from the 80s and it gave it to me a good
tank top I wear all the time
that's why I knew I liked it I don't
think it's me I just took it but I knew
you'd like it because of that logo so I
