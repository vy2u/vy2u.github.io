channel this video was seriously so
requested from you guys I've been seeing
it all over YouTube and I find it really
funny so I thought that dan and I would
give it a try as well if you guys going
out and talking about the title it's the
boyfriend does my voiceover but she's
not my boy she's my fiancee so my
feelings and whatever other guys enjoy
it
and let's get started hey guys it's me
Alex
oh so we're going to do a makeup
tutorial we're going to start with this
clear gel and we're going to rub it all
over our face gonna just get it under
our nose there around the cheek smells
really funky but we got to do this
across our key band and get it up under
the greasy nose next we're going to go
with some foundation I believe and we're
going to dab it all over our nose but
please don't actually dab just dab this
on your face look in the mirror make
sure you're looking pretty looking good
okay now you're just going to paint it
all in paint it all over the place get
it all nice and even make sure you do
your neck too otherwise you're going to
have a white neck and a tanned face next
you're going to take this egg looking
sponge and you're going to dab it again
all over your nose make sure that you're
blending it in close then you're going
to take this very fancy war paint and
you're going to paint lines all over
your face this is important because when
you go outside you want to intimidate
the other girls so make it as scary as
possible make some crosses some lines
but then you realize I'm pretty nice and
I don't want to do that so I'm going to
blend it all in so I don't scare too
many people because we don't want to
scare away all of our friends so blend
it in with our egg sponge make it all
even looks good okay so next we are
going to use this other product here
with once again another brush make sure
that you keep many many brushes near you
because each step requires a completely
different brush for no apparent reason
and these are specifically for your eyes
and on to the next brush see I told you
you need many brushes this one is much
longer than the one we just use now
you're going to put this on your temples
and this probably helps you with your
spirituality so bring it down from your
temple all the way to your neck
and it makes you feel really good then
you're going to go on the other side on
your cheek
all around your temple and I just
realized that that is not the same thing
as a temple where you can go and pray so
scrap what I just said going to continue
brushing it all over your face next
we're going to take our pallet with
again another brush so this is another
brush from our collection but this is a
much paler brush which helps with the
pink undertones on our cheek next it's
time to fluff up our eyebrows because we
want them nice and puffy so you're going
to brush them up you're going to just
make them nice and big and the lump to
it then you're going to paint on them to
make them even darker because let's be
honest we don't really want pale
eyebrows so again continue with the
fluffing just keep propping them up
making them nice and big and fluffy and
then add some paint to make them a
little bit darker give them a nice
rounded slightly pointed shape and then
take your nude palette and rub that on
your upper eyelid to blend it in with
all the layers and layers and layers of
makeup we already put on our face this
is just the tenth layer to go on top
especially in the eyelid region then oh
my god won't cross that I can see okay
back to the eyelids and make sure you're
working on that it looks good okay my
eyes are all better I'm not cross light
anymore so we're going to move on to our
eye lashes so this is a much darker
paint color than we were putting on our
eyebrows because we want the eyelashes
to be darker than the eyebrows to create
a contrast on our face and make it nice
and beautiful just be careful do not
poke yourself in the eye I did that once
and that is why I now go cross-eyed
sometimes so we're going to take yet
again another brush this could be the
same one who knows because they all look
very similar and we skipped ahead to
lips so you're going to take a nice pink
shade put that all over the bottom lip
make sure you're going back and forth at
least 46 times because you want to get
the color really in there don't just
settle for 40 times just go back and
forth as many times as you can then go
on to a second color because one pink is
just not enough to really get those sexy
lips go for two shades of pink it's
really going to make that difference and
it's going to make your lips pop mmm
okay so our last step is to do our hair
so make sure you take it out and then
just play with it your hair it gets
lonely sometimes so just play a couple
of games they toss your fingers to roots
give
some attention then you're going to take
this oil which seems counterintuitive
but you do want to put some oil in your
hair to make it healthy because oily
hair is healthy hair more oil you put
the better just kidding don't actually
do that so once you're done take your
gorgeous look outside and impress
everybody and give them a nice thumbs up
and we'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
