Daniel and today we're going to be doing
another tag this one is verily barely
very highly requested probably my most
requested video and at first I wasn't
really sure if I want to do it just
because I didn't really know if he was
interested but I brought it up and he's
cool so that's fine as you could tell by
the title below it is the girlfriend
does my makeup challenge so basically
what normally happens I guess is the
girlfriend shows the boyfriend the
products and they have to guess what it
is and where they put it but um and if
they get it wrong to apply to their face
but he basically knows what all my
products are so I don't think that would
really I didn't even know that I don't
think that would be fun but yeah I
watched a couple of videos just to see
what it was like and jennamarbles video
is so funny so she just applies makeup
on to him so I guess well just get
started then so we'll start off with of
course Urban Decay D slick you know what
this is primer no guess I don't know it
is basically a setting spray so it just
helps your makeup stay on all day
because we want that way mm-hmm ready
turn your face towards me keep your eyes
and mouth closed you can open are you
done yeah feels like water okay
now we're gonna be using this Revlon
nearly naked foundation it's just in a
pale color
Linc's pale it's winter well it's spring
but basically winter it's supposed to
snow tomorrow yeah it feel sticky yeah
I'm just gonna use my brush because he's
my boyfriend so whatever if this was
anyone else I don't think I would use
dirty brush Therese all right like I'm I
like to smile do I have to keep my mouth
relaxed just keep everything relaxed
just chill out you know you're getting
pampered this actually might be too late
for you you might look like a vampire
Edward Cullen over here I feel like a
celebrity
I mean and it just takes away like all
your retinas
I made him shave this morning so that he
didn't have some like gross beard with
like foundation mixed in like this look
I can't see you okay okay he was growing
this like crazy what was it goatee kind
of thing no I just didn't shave for like
a week and it was all messy I was too
lazy so I don't know whether I want to
make him look like a drag queen yet or
if I want to just make him look like
you're not putting like eyeshadow and
crap like that I'm putting a bunch of
stuff on my honest word yeah get it in
those years gotta blend it down the neck
people don't forget what do you think
this is I read it no that's like a
concealer for your eyes you're good just
like look up like people put their
fingers okay try just look up know if it
looks retarded yeah it doesn't hurt it
just think I'm careful
okay keep your chin down your head down
I won't Patti loves to rub it in
no it's not the amount it's like having
your finger close to my I don't like
roll them back okay look at the top
right there
poking my eyeball so we've got the
concealer done so let's move on to
eyebrows got fill those bad boys in do
they need much filling it in man yeah
what do you think this is mascara but I
don't think you're putting my scare on
here you know I primer close guys you're
putting eye shadow on me after this so
to set his face I'm going to use this
Revlon nearly naked press powder how
much stuff are you putting on my feet
this is just a second foundation a bit
more this really tickles how far you can
put it up like don't you head back okay
yeah that's the extent of my dick well I
can't see like what I'm doing so I don't
know if it's enough for you or not
moving on to bronzer damn it I go
brother and this angled brush by Sigma
it's like a layer after layer after
layer my god okay now I want you to suck
in like this so pretty Daniel okay you
have to do it to an extreme was that a
lot we have some attitude
I know it's like makeup how did you cope
in lipstick I don't know I guess you
could don't dad can't do that guys sound
really nice cheekbone so eg
smile how red is it it's not blends in
smile in tough be a man wear your makeup
this is not skin colour black be putting
on me okay honestly you made me look
like a tramp so I don't do makeup for
life or whatever yeah you knew what you
were doing to me it was not pretty
yeah but I know how to do it you know
what you're doing maybe I don't close
guys that's what I put on you you're
putting that scare on me yeah actually
before I put mascara this what is this
eyebrow eyelash curler are you doing
okay I want you to look like grab my
shoulders holy crap I feel like I'm in a
Clockwork Orange then I close eyes open
and make him watch stuff okay look I can
turn this in
I don't like shit in my clothes guys
that better wouldn't it be easier I
suppose you could do both sides then
like the top and bottom here let me get
that off
don't you know on fire my face is head
fire so itchy here here here here eyes
at you because there's makeup on it what
is that little bit more mascara this one
is like a different brush totally flips

guess your two biggest fears is like
Heights and then mascara no it's just
like when you stick your finger like
near my eyeball freaks me out what do

very sparkly so close your eyes why are
