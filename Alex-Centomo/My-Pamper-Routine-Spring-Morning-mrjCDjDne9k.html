channel I never know how to start videos
so I have been getting so so so many
requests to do spring look books spring
get ready with me spring makeup spring
hair all the kind of stuff and I totally
want to make all these videos but where
I live it's still snowing it's freezing
cold it's really hard to film outside so
I'm kind of restricted to filming videos
indoors right now I just don't
understand it's the middle of April and
it's still snowing so much as if it's
December anyways so I decided to come up
with a video idea to kind of show you
what I like to do to pamper myself in
the morning when I have a day off I have
nothing to do and I kind of switched
these up based off the like months I
guess and obviously this month I'm
trying out different things and I just
love to pamper myself once in a while I
feel like it's very important for
everyone to do that at some point just
to kind of clear their minds to help
relax meditation is a great thing as
well but obviously pampering yourself
just feels so luxurious and awesome it
just makes me really happy so if you are
curious to see the products I've been
loving and what I do to pamper myself
and to relax on my day off then just
keep on watching so the first thing I
always go to when it comes to any kind
of pampering is a face mask you guys
know I love my face masks you guys know
I love origins face masks I've been
talking about them for years since and
I've been using them since before I even
started youtube so one of the new ones
that just came out and something that I
personally really like because it's
quick it's easy and it just feels
amazing on your skin is this one this is
the origins by all greens foaming deep
cleansing mask with green tea spirulina
and spinach so this is actually two in
one product it acts as a clay mask as
well as like a high performance cleanser
for your face and it's designed to
detoxify your skin making it feel very
like smooth and clean and just purified
it really just like the best example I
could say is that it feels
you actually just put some of the
product into your hand and then you're
going to want to spread it over your
face immediately without blending you
want to try to make it even but it's not
a big deal if it's not perfect so don't
try to like blend it in to make it
perfect you just want to apply as evenly
as you can and then you're just gonna
relax and you're gonna allow the phone
to develop it's really cool because when
it sits on your skin you can just chill
so sometimes I do this in the bath where
I just put it on I let it like turn into
this foam so to remove it you're
actually just going to wet your fingers
and then you're gonna massage in
circular motions on your face and that
just makes the foam react a lot more and
then you're going to rinse well
afterwards so yeah it does include green
tea spirulina and spinach and like I
said before green tea isn't really known
for their detox power by all greens is
actually available in retail stores
Sephora and or gyms comm so I'll leave a
link down below in the description where
you can click and check it out if you're
interested but I really like the way
this product works makes your skin feel
amazing and I'm not just saying that
like it really does make your skin feel
amazing Daniel uses it as well so it's
like both of our favorites are moment
the next really important thing and I
kind of guess I'll go along with like
that bathing or showering so when I take
a bath I actually I love lush but I've
actually been kind of experimenting with
DIY bath salt concoctions if that makes
any sense
if you guys don't know I love Pinterest
and I found this like one article that
like allows you to make your own bath
salts they're very relaxing and it uses
essential oils everything that's very
good for you if you want I'll leave that
in the description as well because I
don't have the product with me now to
show you cuz I literally just make it
right before I get into the bath but he
uses essential oils salts so it's like
very very relaxing and very good for you
and you just feel like so relaxed when
you have a bath I've said relax so many
times but I love that word because I
love being relaxed coming from someone
who's typically a more anxious person
being relaxed is like the best thing
ever
I feel like I have lipstick on my teeth
if I do please comment down below let me
know and then while I'm taking a bath
I'll usually like to use a deep
conditioner for my hair or like a I
guess like a hair mask as well because
when I have a lot of time to just have
for myself I like to do all of these
like long products that usually take
more time than like a typical get ready
day so I have like a lineup of hair
masks this is just one that I've been
using recently and I really like it it's
a salons deeply invested hair mask but I
really like the Pantene one I've been
using that for a while now obsessed with
it really like the one from Rio Gio
there was one I was using from lush but
that actually I used up and so I'm
trying to like use up all the other ones
before I purchase anything else so yeah
there's just a few that I really like
but and honestly any kind of hair mask
that is targeted towards noir Shang like
your hair and stuff I would recommend
there's not one that I like obsessed
over the other they all kind of do the
same thing I just go through phases of
what I like also my voice is a little
crazy because I just woke up so that is
why and I get a lot of questions too and
I just realized this because I looked at
my viewfinder thing a lot of people get
confused cuz in my pictures for my
thumbnails my hair looks more silver and
then on camera it looks a lot more
yellow and as you don't explain that
that the reason why it's like that is
because my walls are yellow I know it
doesn't look that bad on camera but in
real life they're pretty yellow and I
hate it so it brings a lot of yellow on
to whoever is in frame so like skin wise
and it's just not the best like if I had
white walls my hair would look a lot
whiter cuz I did get it dyed silver
ombre I'm actually going to get it
touched up but it is more of a silver
color so it's just frustrating that you
can't see that very well with my walls
it's all good it's all good when I move
out I'm having white walls taking care
of your face in your skin is probably
like my top priority so after I use a
detox mask I like to kind of set my face
if that makes any sense
and like moisturize it because not that
the mask leaves it drying it just that
my skin is very drawing just anyways so
the two products I've been loving to
help nourish my skin are these products
from Kiehl's these ones the first one is
the ultra facial cream and I just
the small things travel size and then
this is the daily reviving concentrate
it's like I'm basically an oil that you
mix in with your moisturizer you apply
that all of your face and it feels
amazing it's honestly such a luxurious
product I use this every day it's not
just on days that I pamper myself but
this is something that I would recommend
for someone that has very I guess not
even dry skin that just someone that
needs more hydration and even if you
have oily skin doesn't mean that you
can't use these and using an oil when
you have oily skin like an oil like this
it's not a bad thing trust me then when
I get out of that which you know my skin
is usually very like inflamed from the
warm water and when it starts to drive
starts to get dry so I always make sure
to moisturize and this is something that
I struggle with on a daily basis I know
it's really bad I need to moisturize all
the time but especially on days in my
pamper I make sure to moisturize and
this is what I wear too it's the best
thing ever it's soap and Glory's
righteous butter and as you can see it's
like almost done smells amazing I have
like a little travel-size one so I
always scoop out of this one and put it
in the travel size one because I'm
always traveling so I just make sure I
always have it on me it feels amazing on
my skin it leaves it moisturized all day
long that's what I like really like
about it and it's thick so you really
feel like it's working well it's not
like runny and this absorbs into your
skin right away you feel amazing the
next thing I have to say for like I
guess pampering or relaxing for a day
that I have like a day off and I don't
want to be doing much I suggest reading
because reading is very very good for
your brain I know a lot of people like
to listen to audiobooks I personally
like to listen to podcasts Joe Santa got
OH awesome so funny but I really like
reading actual books I'm just I'm not
like against audiobooks I just
personally don't like them because I
like to read and I like to have the
physical copy I don't like to happen to
like a Kindle or whatever I'm weird I
know it's just that's just how I am so I
just picked up this book because it's
the last one that I read and it's the
dance with dragons from the Game of
Thrones series the most recent book I
say that because I'm so excited for the
series to come out I love the TV show as
well oh the Sun came up I think reading
is
really important for your brain for your
memory for being able to have a longer
attention span I find our generation has
like the quickest attend like they
cannot concentrate for longer than like
five minutes straight like I even catch
myself sometimes I'll be watching a TV
show and then I'll be checking Twitter
at the same time and I'm like I can't
just concentrate on one thing at a time
like geez so then I find when I'm
reading a lot it really helps me I guess
concentrate on one thing over the other
which is such a weird thing to think
about but it's true and then I guess
another thing you can do is paint your
nails but I actually haven't page in my
nails since probably Fashion Week in New
York and that was because my nails were
like yellow from always having polish on
them for years so I took months off of
my nail polish and now they're super
super healthy not yellow at all and I'm
obsessed with them so I just I'm not
gonna paint them anymore
so that's not something I would do but
you guys could totally do that and if
you guys do anything else
