to be about attending video what's up
guys i'm here today with the very all
the times i always took my words and
like see she's so popular guys she just
gets phone calls 24/7 what's up guys i'm
here today with a very special guest
this is ali and she runs she owns not
run she owns this tanning a studio the
mat right now which is very beautiful as
you can see from the background flowers
and everything a lot of you guys asked
me on instagram if you guys follow me on
instagram i new people my blogging
channel you'll know that i get spray
tans alive and i get so many questions
about it and I figured what would be
better than to just have Ali here
explaining everything to you guys
because I don't do this so I don't know
really good much about you know spray
tans and stuff but I do know but it's
like the healthier alternative in like
getting real so I have a few questions
that I think would just be general good
so first one is why choose a spray tan
over
well definitely it is the same
alternative to getting any type of Sun
yeah right so it's you be free
there's no danger no harm to your skin
you're protecting yourself I mean we're
not getting any younger girls we got to
protect ourselves um there is no SPF in
the spare time so even know that yeah
even though you do go out in the Sun
after you can still tan through but you
stopped a record yeah
make sure you yeah maybe wear your
sunscreen even if you are young and you
think like oh I'm gonna have nice skin
forever like
that's not good don't ever hand out ten
that don't it's very dangerous
well big question is will you be orange
you get this curse - do I look orange
going no I mean they look kind of washed
out right now because the lighting but
we never look orange no you will never
look orange I work with an amazing
company called Norville actually and
Norville uses eco certify and an F DHA
it's a purest form of DHA available in
the market so in terms of quality of the
product it's really top of the line
there's no carbons don't additives no
sulfates it's a really all-natural great
stuff yet it's gluten free - right yeah
awesome anything that's like organic
gluten free good for you it's just like
I made a bonus you know so and yeah you
just hope your enjoy it depends also on
the skin tone you have you'll look a
different shade let's say she sprayed me
the same exact thing that you sprayed my
sister our tan will come out differently
because we have a different it was
different these different phases yeah
like shave all them tone yet but it
won't ever look orange like it doesn't
you also want to follow the proper steps
before let me that's one of the
questions that's okay so what it is what
to do before and after okay so before
you come for a spray tan very important
you want to shave shower and exfoliate
you want to remove all the dead skin
cells off your body so you can really
start with a nice dress why is it bad
why do you have to remove well because
your skin sheds on a seven-day cycle
naturally right so you want your spray
tan to last as long as possible so by
exfoliating removing the dead skin cells
you start with a proper base yeah right
you don't want to add any creams or
makeup before coming
this will only act as a barrier so I
mean you can but just gonna make your
spray tan loss less right fine that's
what you do before and then a lot of
questions again is how long is this very
time gonna last and what to do
afterwards to prolong it yeah so it's
very different it's hard to give like an
exact day
in the last three days it's different
for everyone so I say the more you take
care of it the longer it's gonna last
right so by following the proper steps
before then you wait you're 8 to 12
hours before taking a shower oh yeah
that's one thing you can't shower for
each 12 hours and if it's raining
outside you want to be very careful yes
you'll have great spots yeah that's why
I make all my phone calls I'm like oh my
god please wear your rain boots and
upper lids I'm prepared yeah oh my god
so yeah super important to avoid any
type of water for the next 8 to 12 hours
and then after your spray time you take
your shower and then you want to keep
yourself hydrated and moisturize a lot
those are the more the better because
the more you drink obviously the more
hydrated your skin is gonna be the less
of dry it is which means the less
flaking and the list the tag comes off
yeah and that fill wear off nice and
evenly
yeah of yourself moisture yeah if you
don't moisturize and you find your time
is coming off Itachi that's kind of your
own fault I think there are also creams
that you can buy like I know they used
some kind of thunder they do help extend
the time so I know the first time I went
out lay with Kareena of her shoot we got
the spray tan and but the shoot was only
a few days after so she gave us this
cream that you put on like the night
before yeah you wake up in the morning
and it's as if you just like it's like
really enhances the time yeah so that
was real fun yeah and we leave my things
at work you're like oh yeah
and it smells really good you guys know
it smells really good doesn't smell like
I guess but that gross Tencent every
time yeah because I used to buy sensual
thing fling them line there and it found
it smell bad so I find this smells good
like you can she sprays it and it's
yeah it's like a raspberry almond which
neutralizes the smell of DHA DHA that
you associate that spray that's not so
I'm going to like run a little clip here
of Ali's spray my sister and so I'll
show you like before and after and also
if you guys you want to check out my
Instagram pictures because you'll see
like the actual how it looks like how
it's so natural and stuff and even my
blogs you'll see
I hope you guys got I guess a general
sense of what to expect when you go I
mean you don't have to wear a bikini
when you go get a spray tan I sometimes
go all naked which I'm like Ali do you
care if I'm all naked just like no it's
whatever you wear the tan lines are
gonna have to live with exactly exciting
what I know is I most recommend it as
you go topless but then you were a very
small skinny like fall yeah so I mean
you're minimal time yeah exactly
obviously if you're not comfortable
enough for the person you can just wear
a bikini
q we want you to be as comfortable as
exactly it doesn't hurt it takes like
what eight minutes yeah I was five
minutes I'm pretty sure it was like
really quick and make sure that you wear
dark clothes a new pop or else it might
rub off something loose to throw on
after exactly and then you wait your age
twelve hours you shower you don't use
soap or water rinse you can just so
Brittany yeah but don't like rub your
whole body with so and then yeah should
be all good after that so I really
encourage you guys to go check out the
Ali's website her Instagram all of her
social media links will be listed down
below for you guys if you can go follow
her and give us some love for our Chen
