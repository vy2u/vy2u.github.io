skincare video you have asked me so many
times to this video and I have actually
done one before it was the Michael Todd
kind of review slash skincare line but
as you all know and I'm sure many other
beauty gurus do this as well but we like
to switch up a routine a lot and I just
find that's best for my skin if I stay
with the same products for a long time
my skin I think just gets used to it and
it doesn't work as well so I do like to
mix it up after a few months so I've
been using these products for the past
I'd say maybe four or five months
I now have just been loving them and
they've been doing wonders for my skin a
lot of people actually have totally
person that my skin is looking a lot
better so yeah I'm excited to show you
guys so for a little background about my
skin I do have combination oily / dry
skin I have like patches of oiliness and
patches of dryness I do struggle with
acne once in a while it's not bad but I
do have the occasional breakout and I do
have some acne scarring and stuff so I
like to use products that are more
geared towards that kind of skin type I
guess let's just get into it starting
off with what I use to clean my face I
actually use this product right here -
the origins checks-and-balances brought
the face wash wow that was really really
hard to say but I actually purchased
this because of missglamorazzi she was
using it one time and we have kind of
the same skin type and so I checked it
out at Sephora and I tried out a sample
and I just absolutely fell in love and
then I was in one of my favorite videos
as well because I was using it all the
time this is actually the third package
that I have purchased just because it
has done wonders for my skin basically
what this does is it kind of balances
out everything so since I have oily skin
/ dry patches I needed something that
was gonna gear towards those two spots
in my face so I needed something that
gonna kind of balance everything out
plus I do have redness so this is I
swear to God a miracle worker
it like hydrates the dry parts but it
also controls the oil in my oily regions
on my face which is basically like my
t-zone and it also helps with redness
like a ninety percent of my face and I
barely have any redness maybe just a
little bit around my nose but I mean
that's normal for any woman but this I'm
just so obsessed with it I I love this
smell it's very like it's like minty and
clean and why would you stand out of
that so what I do is I just every
morning and every night I wake up in the
morning I wash my face and this what I
do is I pour a little bit on my hands
and I massage it into my hands first
before I put on my face and then when it
gets really foamy then that's when I rub
it all over my face because I just find
it works best that way doesn't leave
your face dry it doesn't leave it to
oily it's just like the perfect
combination so if you have the same kind
of skin type as me that I would really
suggest checking out that product
because it is really work for me now I
don't really exfoliate my skin that much
just because three reasons in the past
it's really like messed up my skin and
everything so I try to avoid that but I
do like using masks so this side
actually is been my favorite for a while
now and I just got it at my local
grocery store actually you can get at
any drugstore is the facial clay mask
with avocado and oatmeal the brand is
Freeman and it's just like a typical
green mask so you apply it a thick layer
all over your skin you let it sit for
around 10 to 20 minutes I usually like
to let it sit a bit longer and it really
tightens up your skin and then I find
when you wash it off after it just your
skin feels like a baby's butt I'm not
even kidding it's so soft
and it just feels so fresh and I usually
do that around once a week because any
lot if you do that more often
it actually can make your skin worse
than it is so usually once a week is
good so that's what I usually like to
use now on to moisturizers I like to use
moisturizers to have an SPF in them just
because I spend a lot of time outside
and it's really important to use
sunscreen or SPF and I haven't found a
sunscreen that's perfect for my face yet
because a lot of sunscreens break me out
so I actually been using
creams that have SPF already built into
them and I've just been a huge fan of
the you know line for the longest
longest time for years
it's the you know positively radiant
daily moisturizer with SPF 15 and I just
think it works so well I use this all
over my face in the morning and it's
really good to apply makeup on top of it
doesn't smudge doesn't make your face
look greasy or anything like that
so when I know I'm going to be spending
a lot of time outside I like to use this
one because it just really helps protect
your skin from the Sun and all that kind
of stuff on days you might know I'm not
gonna be spending much time in the Sun
and I'm gonna be indoors a lot let's say
I'm working all day or I have a photo
shoot or something like that I like to
use a moisturizer that's going to help
control the oils in my face like I keep
my face matte for a long period of time
because I do find if I don't use this
moisturizer then after a while and my
face does seem to look a little bit
greasy if I'm outside it doesn't really
bug me because it's hot whatever it
doesn't matter but if I'm going to be
spending a lot of time indoors away from
the Sun and especially with photo shoots
or thumbing I like to use this
moisturizer it's the fresh embryonic
clay oil-free lotion I don't know if I
say that right I'm brie and Riaan it's
for normal to oily skin and this just
really helps mattify your skin and
without making it look dry or anything
it doesn't cling to my dry patches at
all it just really helps purifies and it
balances and it just it's multiple need
actually and I just really like the
fresh line at Sephora I like a lot of
good product it doesn't leave my skin
oily I'm wearing it today and I do have
a little bit of shine because they put
some highlighter but it just really
helps control the oil and the one thing
about that one is good for like videos
and photo shoots it doesn't create like
that white cast in pictures because of
the flash because there's no SPF in it
so that's another plus like if I'm going
out or something I like to use that
underneath my eyes I really like to use
an eye cream just because lately I've
been finding I have a little bit of like
dryness under my eyes which is never
happened before and I'm just like oh my
gosh what's going on why am i getting
dry but then I found this eye cream and
it really really has helped a lot with
my dryness it's the origins ginseng
cream and this just smells like citrusy
and so good and I just really really
like this eye cream a lot it's a little
bit on the pricier side but it really
does work if you don't need an eye cream
you don't need to put an eye cream like
I've never used by Queen before just
recently I've noticed that had dryness
under my eyes and like my makeup s like
clung to it so that's why I purchased
this just because I want to try it out
actually try a sample before and I
really liked it that's why I purchased
the bigger one and then before bed I
really like to apply a different kind of
moisturizer because I don't want to have
a moisturizer with SPF if I just want to
sleep it doesn't it's not really gonna
do anything you know so I've actually
been using this moisturizer for a long
time and it is the karez Wild Rose and
vitamin C advanced brightening sleeping
facial so I like to use this at night
and it just looks like this and it
smells like a million rose petals has
just been lodged inside here it smells
so good and it keeps your skin so
moisturized I wake up the next morning
and I'm just like wow my skin feels so
soft you know my boyfriend was like
touching my skin the other day and he
was just like holy crap that's really
nice now on to some spot treatments so
swatch Anna that I've really been liking
for a long time is the grease lightening
from lush this acne spot treatment works
really well and what I like about this
is since it's all natural it like really
gets rid of the spot properly it doesn't
like use a bunch of harsh chemicals to
kind of just like zap the spa and get
rid of it right away so it does take a
bit longer but when I do have a few
spots in different places I like to
every single night put some of this on
after I put on moisturizer and I sleep
on it the next morning there's seriously
a huge reduction in the redness and the
swelling of the spots but sometimes we
all get that huge cystic acne that just
kills if you touch anywhere around it oh
my gosh I had the worst one on my chin
the other day it hurts so bad so that's
when I turned it to something like this
which is the cleaning clear acne spot
treatment this one does use some
chemicals it's not all natural like lush
but it does get the job done and I don't
really have a problem of using too many
chemicals
face it doesn't really do much damage to
my skin so I know maybe in the long run
I've heard sometimes they can but I mean
it's just an acne spot you mean it's not
like I'm putting this all over my face
so if I do have that huge breakout that
just like kills and it hurts to like eat
or smile or something that's when I can
use this because this really just like
gets rid of it right away but please if
you own this try not to use it on like
little spots just because it will get
rid of it but it's it's not the best
thing for you so an honesty like I would
just go for this one and get rid of it
the right way but if you have a huge one
that you know like you have something
that I say that you really do not want
to have is it for then this one is
probably gonna work better just because
it gets rid of it quicker so that's
about all I use for my skin honestly
like I don't like to put got me products
on my face I know something - gurus have
like specific things for certain days
and you know struggling with acne and
all that stuff but this stuff that I use
right here has really helped turned out
my acne so much obviously with hormones
being a girl pretty group for you girls
out there when is that - having months
you can't really control them as much so
you just gotta learn to live with it all
that stuff but it's normal it happens to
everyone I know I have so many friends
that struggle with acne it's really not
the end of the world honestly guys and
the thing about acne is that when you're
older it just means less wrinkles
because your skin is more oily so you
can think about it that way it's pretty
sweet so if you have any questions or
comments about this video please leave
them down below I'm gonna be reading all
the comments and responding to as many
as I can if you have any other
suggestions for me or if you struggle
the same kind of skin that I do or if
you're gonna purchase any of the
products and you want to let me know how
they work for you I would love to hear
that I love hearing you guys your
feedback and everything like that so
