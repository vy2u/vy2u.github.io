skin care video you have asked me so
many times to this video and I actually
done one before it was the Michael Todd
kind of review / skincare line but as
you all know and I'm sure many other
beauty gurus do this as well but we like
to switch up a routine a lot and I just
find that's best for my skin if I stay
with the same products for a long time
my skin I think just gets used to it and
it doesn't work as well so I do like to
mix it up after a few months so I've
been using these products for the past
i'd say maybe four or five months i now
have just been loving them and they've
been doing wonders for my skin a lot of
people actually have totally person that
my skin is looking a lot better so yeah
i'm excited to show you guys so for a
little background about my skin i do
have combination oily / dry skin i have
like patches of oiliness and patches of
dryness I do struggle with acne once in
a while it's not bad but I do have the
occasional breakout and I do have some
acne scarring and stuff so I like to use
products that are more geared towards
that kind of skin type I guess let's
just get into it starting off with what
I use to clean my face I actually use
this product right here and as the
origins checks and balances frothy face
wash wow that was really really hard to
say but i actually purchased this
because of missglamorazzi she was using
it one time and we have kind of the same
skin type and so I checked it out at
sephora and i tried out a sample and i
just absolutely fell in love and the
nose in one of my favorite videos as
well because i was using it all the time
this is actually the third package that
I approaches just because it has done
wonders for my skin basically what this
does is it kind of balances out
everything so since I have oily skin /
dry patches I needed something that was
going to gear towards those two spots in
my face so I needed something that was
going to kind of balance everything out
plus I do have redness so this is I
swear to God a miracle worker um it like
hydrates the dry parts but it also
controls the oil in my oily regions on
my face which is basically like my
t-zone and it also helps with redness
like a 9-under sat on my face
barely have any redness maybe just a
little bit around my nose but I mean
that's normal for any woman but this I'm
just so obsessed with it I I love the
smell it's very like it's like minty and
clean and whoo why I just came out of
that so what I do is I just every
morning and every night I wake up in the
morning I washing face with this what I
do is I pour a little bit on my hands
and I massage it into my hands first
before I plan on my face and then when
it gets really funny then that's when I
rub it all over my face because I just
find it works best that way does it
leave your face dry doesn't leave it to
oily just like the perfect combination
so if you have the same kind of skin
type as me that I would really suggest
checking out that product because it is
really work for me now I don't really
exfoliate my skin that much just because
um through reasons in the past it's
really like messed up my skin and
everything so I try to avoid that but I
do like using masks so this side
actually has been my favorite for a
while now and I just got it at my local
grocery store actually you can get at
any drugstore is the facial clay mask
with avocado and oatmeal the brand is
Freeman and it's just like a typical
green mask so you apply a thick layer
all over your skin you let it sit for
around 10 to 20 minutes I usually like
to let it sit a bit longer and it really
tightens up your skin and then I find
when you wash it off after it just your
skin feels like a baby's butt I'm not
even kidding it's so soft and it just
feels so fresh and I usually do that
around once a week because any law if
you do that more often it actually can
make your skin worse than it is so
usually once a week is good so that's
what I usually like to use now onto
moisturizers I like to use moisturizers
to have an SPF in them just because I
spent a lot of time outside and it's
really important to use sunscreen or SPF
and I haven't found a sunscreen that's
perfect for my face yet because a lot of
sunscreens break me out so actually been
using creams that have SPF already built
into them and I've just been a huge fan
of the aveeno line for the longest
longest time for years it's the aveeno
positively radiant daily moisturizer
with SPF 15 and I just think it works so
well I use this all over my face in the
morning
and it's really good to apply makeup on
top of it doesn't smudge doesn't make
your face look greasy or anything like
that so when I know going to be spending
a lot of time outside I like to use this
one because it just really helps protect
your skin from the Sun and all that kind
of stuff on days you might know I'm not
gonna be spending much time in the Sun
and I'm going to be indoors a lot let's
say I'm working all day or I have a
photo shoot or something like that I
like to use a moisturizer that's going
to help control the oils in my face like
I keep my face map for a long period of
time because i do find if i don't use
this moisturizer then after a while my
face does seem to look a little bit
greasy if i'm outside of this is really
bugged me because it's hot whatever it
doesn't matter but if i'm going to be
spending a lot of time indoors away from
the side and especially with photo
shoots or foaming i like to use this
moisturizer it's the fresh umbreon clay
oil free lotion I don't know if I say
that right umbreon Brean it's for normal
to oily skin and this just really helps
mattify your skin and without making it
look dry or anything it doesn't cling to
my dry patches at all it just really
helps purifies and it balances and it
just it's multiplied need actually and I
just really like the fresh line at
sephora i like a lot of good product
doesn't leave my skin oily and wearing
it today and i do have a little bit of
shine because they put some highlighter
but it just really helps control the oil
and the one thing about that one is good
for like videos and photo shoots it
doesn't create like that white cast in
pictures because of the flash because
there's no SPF in it so that's another
plus like if I'm going out or something
i like to use that underneath my eyes i
really like to use eye cream just
because lately i'm finding i have a
little bit of like dryness under my eyes
which is never happened before and just
like oh my gosh what's going on why am i
getting dry but then I found this eye
cream and it really really has helped a
lot with my dryness it's the origins
ginseng eye cream and this just smells
like citrusy and so good and I just
really really like this I cream a lot
it's a little bit on the pricier side
but it really does work if you don't
need an eye cream you don't need to put
an eye cream like I've never use eye
cream before just recently I've noticed
I've had dryness under my
and like my makeup has like clung to it
so that's why i purchased this just
because i want to try it out actually
try a sample before and i really liked
it that's why i purchased the bigger one
and then before bed i really like to
apply a different kind of moisturizer
because i don't want to have a
moisturizer with SPF if I'm just want to
sleep it doesn't it's not really going
to do anything you know so I've actually
been using this moisturizer for a long
time and it is the karez wild rose and
vitamin C advanced brightening sleeping
facial so I like to use this at night
and it just looks like this and it
smells like a million rose petals has
just been lodged inside here it smells
so good and it keeps your skin so
moisturized I wake up the next morning
and I'm just like wow I skin feels so
soft even my boyfriend was like touching
my skin the other day who's just like
holy crap that's really nice now on to
some spot treatments so spot shanna that
I've really been liking for a long time
is the grease lightning from lush this
aqua spot treatment works really well
and what I like about this is since it's
all-natural it like really gets rid of
the spot properly it doesn't like use a
bunch of harsh chemicals to kind of just
like Zac the spa and get rid of it right
away so it does take a bit longer but
when I do have a few spots in different
places I liked it every single night put
some of this on after I put on
moisturizer and I sleep on it the next
morning there's seriously a huge
reduction in the redness and the
swelling of the spot but sometimes we
all get that huge cystic acne that just
kills if you touch anywhere around it oh
my gosh I had the worst one of my chin
the other day it hurts so bad so that's
when I turn it to something like this
which is the cleaning clear acne spot
treatment this one does use some
chemicals it's not all natural like lush
but it does get the job done and I don't
really have a problem of using too many
chemicals on my face it doesn't really
do much damage to my skin so I know
maybe in the long run I've heard
sometimes they can but I mean it's just
an acne spot treatment it's not like I'm
putting this all over my face so if I do
have a huge break out that just like
kills and it hurts to like eat or smile
or something that's when I use this
because this
really just like gets rid of it right
away but please if you only try not to
use it on like little spots just because
it will get rid of it but it's it's not
the best thing for you so in honesty
like I would just go for this one and
get rid of it the right way but if you
have a huge one that you know like you
have something the next day that you
really do not want to have is it for
then this one is probably going to work
better just because it gets rid of it
quicker so that's about all I use for my
skin honestly like I don't like to put
that many products on my face I know
something to gurus have like specific
things for certain days and you know
struggling with acne and all that stuff
but this stuff that I use right here has
really helped Chandra on my acne so much
obviously with hormones being a girl
free room for you girls up there when is
that time a month you can't really
control them as much so you just got to
learn to live with it all that stuff but
it's normal it happens to everyone i
know i have so many friends that
struggle with acne it's really not the
end of the world honestly guys and thing
about acne is that when you're older it
just means less wrinkles because your
skin is more oily so you can think about
it that way it's pretty sweet so if you
have any questions or comments about
this video please leave them down below
i'm going to be reading all the comments
and responding to as many as i can if
you have any other suggestions for me or

that i do or if you're going to purchase
