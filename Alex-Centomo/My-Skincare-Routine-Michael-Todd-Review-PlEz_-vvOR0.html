do my skincare routine finally I've been
getting a lot of requests to do this
video but I'm finally on it I did
purchase some products that I want to
try out a couple of weeks before I did
talk about them just to see how my skin
was reacting to them but I am definitely
ready to talk about each product that I
use so I guess I'll go in like the order
that I would use these products before I
get started I want to mention that some
of the products that I'm gonna be
talking about I have a discount code for
you guys to use so if you are interested
in purchasing any of the products I will
link that down below so you could just
click on the link and then it'll bring
you to the page where you can get 20%
off so yeah it's pretty exciting so I
guess let's just get right into it okay
so starting off with what I cleanse my
face with is this Michael Todd charcoal
detox deep pork gel cleanser so this
stuff right here is like my Holy Grail
it is amazing honestly when I first
tried it out I was a bit skeptical
because this stuff is like black like
you pump it onto your hand and it's
totally black so I looked at that and I
was just like what is this like oh my
god and I mean it's organic so it does
smell like charcoal but it's not
horrible yeah the description here says
that it completely removes dirt oil
makeup and other impurities without
stripping skins natural moisture
activated charcoal is highly absorbent
to penetrate deeply into pores and
gently draw out impurities leaving skin
feeling clean soft smooth and refresh
indicated in the treatment of acne and
problem skin rinsed thoroughly without
residue so this I I decide to get this
one because lately I've been getting a
lot of breakouts and I did sort of have
you know I never had like bad acne but
throughout my school I did you know how
blemishes always and then it kind of
went away when I turned 18 I mean I just
I used to never get pimples and for some
reason this year I don't know if it's
because I'm experimenting with different
makeup runs but my skin has just been
reacting like crazy so I
got this to help treat my like blemishes
and I could say that like in two weeks
of using this I've barely been getting
any breakouts and when I do it's like
very small and they're gone within a day
so I mean I really like this stuff a lot
you just lob it onto your face and rinse
it off the one thing I'm not too
impressed with I guess it's just this
pump I mean I really like the pump but
the only thing is I there's no way to
like lock it in place so that I can't
really travel with it because if I put
it into my suitcase or a bag or
something and it gets you know squished
all those stuff will come out so I mean
I just been like putting it into a
ziploc bag or something but other than
that this stuff is amazing
I guess now moving on to masks because I
like to use masks after I wash my face
so the first one that I'm going to be
talking about is by Michael Todd again
and actually the discount code is for
Michael Todd just in case I didn't make
that clear I don't really remember if I
mentioned that before so this is the
Michael Todd true organics charcoal
detoxifying facial mask this mask is you
know it's within the charcoal line which
I find is really good for skin and this
one is extra absorbent and moisturizing
normal to dry mature and sensitive skin
now this is different than the skin I
normally have because I do get oily skin
but I've been noticing like recently
especially in the winter I've been
getting dry patches like randomly on my
cheeks and stuff and it'll be kind of
flaky I know that sounds really gross
but I guess I have combination skin I'm
not really sure what that means I got
that for you know I need your eye skin
but this one here I'm just gonna be
reading the description on the back and
this one says its detoxifying skin
treatment that uses the extra absorbent
power of mineral rich charcoal as it
exfoliates to draw out the purities and
tones and clears the skin of excess oil
dirt and other poly tints and then
there's a bunch of other things but
again this is like 96% organic if you
read the ink
on the back you're actually like what
there's so many everything in brackets
organic organic organic it just it's
crazy um and this stuff honestly like
it's amazing I do this I guess once a
week once or twice a week depending on
you know how bad my skin is that week
but I will wash my face and then I will
do a full layer of this on top and I
guess I'll leave it around for 10 to 15
minutes just to set on my face and then
I'll all wash it off but what I really
like about this face mask it's not one
of those face masks that you put on and
like your face is just stuck in that
position and you can't smile you can't
move you're just like stuck like that
until you rinse it off this you can
actually move around but you feel like
cleansing your skin and I really like
this because of that effect because it's
almost like a tingling sensation I find
and then when you rinse it off your skin
it just feels like your skin can breathe
like that's what I really really like
about this product
now on to Mannix Michael Todd product is
this this is like the best thing I have
ever owned in my entire life and it is
the Michael Todd blue-green algae
antibacterial toner now I was never a
fan of using toners when I was younger I
did try out Proactiv once and I just it
like completely made my skin crazy and I
just wasn't a fan of the toner it burned
and that's what I found in most owners
is that they always break my skin and
when I got this I was a bit skeptical
because I I was scared that it was gonna
burn my skin again but this stuff is
amazing it has a very small lavender
scent and it's really really really
moisturizing and hydrating and it glides
on so nicely and it dries like pretty
quickly but it doesn't dry out your skin
it just it sets on and you just feel
like your skin is hydrated it's I don't
even know how to explain this product
it's amazing it says here highly
moisturizing anti-inflammatory and
antibacterial all skin types aids in
treatment and prevention of acne so I
really noticed that this helps a lot
with the blemishes that I've been
getting I've honestly haven't been
getting that many blemishes at all
because of this product I just love it
so much it really is highly moisturizing
and I've noticed especially because I do
sometimes have redness on you know
different parts of my skin especially
after I wash it but this will totally
remove any redness on your face the
description says rich and vital
nutrients trace elements and amino acids
blue-green algae and organic helped in
combination with hyaluronic acid
penetrate deeply into the skin to speed
the elimination of toxins promote
cellular renewal naturally look nourish
and remain alright remineralize the skin
it's highly moisturizing blah blah blah
blah blah but yeah I would highly highly
highly recommend this product it is
amazing I mean I can't go anywhere
without it I will apply it morning and
night after I wash my face and it just
it completely gives me back that
moisture and that like rich feeling
because I mean I don't know about you
but in the winter my skin is very very
dry so this just really makes it feel
healthy and yeah I would definitely
check this out onto my last product from
Michael Todd it is the Michael Todd
Moisture light and this is not oily
hydrating lotion it controls oil and
shine it won't clog pores and it's
normal to oily and combination skin now
this stuff smells amazing oh man it
comes out and like a little pump like
this you just do honestly the smallest
amount and you're set it smells like
lemon cheesecake and I know that may
sound gross to you guys but it's it just
smells like lemon like very citrusy and
but like I kind of want to eat it which
is really close but what I really like
about this moisturizer is I find with a
lot of moisturizers they tend to kind of
stick on your face and just feel very
like sticky and they don't set properly
and you have to wait a long time before
you apply your makeup or anything like
that and then they you know at least for
me make my skin feel a lot more
than it is but this stuff it's it it
stays on your face for like five minutes
and it it almost like adds like an extra
layer of perfect skin to your face
because it doesn't feel like you have
moisture eyes are on it just feels like
your skin is so smooth and it smells
amazing
and I've noticed a huge difference with
my skin because sometimes I do get dry
patches and my skin has just been like
completely I don't know
perfect I guess I really like it and the
description in the box says a soothing
hydrating lotion formulated for
individuals with normal to oily and
combination skin types for whom regular
moisturizers are not suitable it's non
greasy absorbs completely without
clogging pores soothes and moisturizes
where skin is dry while controlling oil
and shine now this is like my perfect
moisturizer because I do have
combination to oily skin so I do get dry
patches and then I have oily patches and
I can never find a moisturizer that is
like perfect for my skin but this
seriously it is perfect for my skin I
love it so yeah I wish you guys like
could smell this because oh my god I
really feel like eating lemon cheesecake
right now and it's all for my Michael
Todd products if you guys want the 20%
off discount code just you know click
the link that I'll post in the
description below and you guys can try
out whatever products you want Michael
Todd is honestly a really good skin care
line I know a lot of people on YouTube
rave about them and I was kind of
skeptical to try it just because I was
like yeah I mean it can't be that good
but honestly it's like I'm so happy I
found it and they have a bunch of
products for mature skin so you know
anti-aging serums and you know eye
creams and stuff so seriously check it
out they have like a list of all with
their products for like certain skin
types so you can actually like find what
your skin type is and then they'll you
know post all of the products they have
for that certain skin type it's amazing
so definitely go try it out now as for
other products that I like to use I
really love obviously I've spoken about
this many times
but my Bioderma solution I absolutely
love this stuff it's my second bottle
and look I'm whole stun um I used to use
this kind of as a toner before I was
using my Michael Todd stuff I mostly use
it to room with my makeup so I'll take a
makeup remover wipe and just take off as
much makeup as I can and then I'll use
this with an exfoliating like cotton pad
and I I'll use like smallest drops on it
and do it twice on my face and it takes
out any excess oil and dirt and makeup
that you've forgotten to take that
hasn't not forgotten but hasn't been
taken off with the wipes and this is
actually really good on my eyes I find I
don't normally wear waterproof makeup so
I can't see for that but for everyday
makeup on my eyes it like takes off
mascara with like two swipes it's
amazing and yeah sometimes this is not
good to say but if I come home from like
a night out or something and I'm
exhausted I will you know
just use my wife's and then use this it
cleanses your face so it's not the
biggest deal at least you're not going
to bed with makeup on your face so that
is great and I would recommend this you
can get it at any drugstore I just got
it at my local drugstore called farmer
pre I guess that's only in my roll but
yeah this stuff is great as for my acne
control I have been using my clean and
clear acne spot treatment this stuff is
okay it's not the best acne spot
treatment I've ever tried but for
drugstore brand it's probably the best
that they have price-wise it's really
good I think it's around $10 I just take
a little tiny drop of this and apply it
to any blemish I have before I go to
sleep and honestly the next morning like
there's a significant reduction for
those acne spots that are you know deep
within the skin and they're not really
out there yet I don't think this would
really help with that but for the spots
that have kind of you know protruded on
your skin you can definitely notice that
link this is great so I love this like
especially if I have something important
the next day like an event or an
interview or anything like that I will
use this and it's great because I don't
have like crazy spots on my face
the next product that I love has been my
urban decay D slick makeup setting spray
I like to apply this before I put any
makeup
and then afterwards and it keeps my
makeup set all day long it you would be
surprised but this actually doesn't make
your face oily looking because you are
spraying on like liquid to your face but
it sets and it dries and sometimes I
will actually use this just to hydrate
my skin throughout the day if I'm out of
the house for a long time or from gone
for a couple days and I just feel like
my skin needs that extra moisture I will
sometimes just spray this on my face
when I'm in a hurry and it just kind of
brings my skin back to looking healthy
again it's also oil control which is
great because I do get oily patches so I
love that now on to the last product
this is something that I wouldn't
recommend to be using on a weekly basis
I use this I guess once every three
weeks or something just when I really
feel like my skin needs that really deep
like cleanse because it feels like maybe
I've been using too many products on it
or something I just need to get all that
excess dirt out of my pores it is just a
green face mask now this is like a face
mask I was saying before that you put a
thin layer on your skin and you cannot
move your face you can't smile you can't
laugh you can't do anything you're just
kind of stuck there but it does tighten
the skin and it really does do a deep
cleaning so this one is just the
freeman's feeling beautiful facial clean
mask with avocado and oatmeal I like the
scent of this it's very like organic
smelling and it's like the typical green
face mask I like this you know once
every couple weeks I'll you know take a
popper day to really relax and you know
fix up my skin in my hair and my nails
and everything that has just been
getting kind of gross the past couple
weeks definitely recommend getting a
green face mask it's really good for
your skin every couple weeks and what I
do like about this is that it really
brings life back to your face and you
can use this at any age because it
really does firm the skin I've really
noticed that with this product I don't
know if they sell this everywhere I know
in Canada they sell these like freeman's
clay masks but you can find a green clay
mask anywhere any drugstore sells
different bride of it but yeah it really
firms the skin I know it's a perfect
product for women with mature skin
because it does I don't know how it
works but it like pulls your skin back a
little bit and I find after I rinse it
off my skin does feel tight it feels
almost like I got Botox or something I
know how to explain it but and it gets
rid of all that extra gunk in your skin
and you're left feeling really fresh and
refine so I would definitely recommend
that to anyone those are just like my
main products that I love to use so yeah
again don't forget to check out the
discount code below the link for the
Michael Todd true organics line and you

which one works for you and then you get
20% off your total order so that's
