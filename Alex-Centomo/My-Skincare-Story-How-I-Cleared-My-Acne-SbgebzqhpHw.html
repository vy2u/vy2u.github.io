makeup on my face oh I have been getting
so many across from you guys lately to
do an updated skincare routine if you
don't follow me on snapchat or my
blogging channel you won't know any of
this but I have kind of switched up my
skincare routine I want to film this
today because it's not like the best
skin day for me I mean it's way better
than it was ever before but I'm gonna do
have like a spot here and some spots
somewhere I can't see because of blind I
also don't know why it seems so blue in
my room right now I don't know if it's
sitting on my camera or something oh
well before I get started I just want to
say that you know everyone's skin is
different what works for me might not
work for you but hopefully I can help in
some way oh that's why it was blue
because it was so cloudy now the sun's
out and it's going away I'm gonna give a
little background so my skin in high
school was not the greatest I did have
acne wasn't bad like I had like maybe a
pimple here and there nothing too crazy
it was when I graduated high school and
I stopped swimming competitively I don't
know if the chlorine was like helping my
skin or something but I just really went
through a few years of like really bad
acne and also doesn't help that I was
wearing makeup a lot I never wore makeup
in high school ever like I don't even
wear makeup to prom I was not into
makeup I don't know how I did I look
back at pictures and I'm like oh
goodness
but whatever then when I was done in
high school I was experimenting with
makeup YouTube was happening beauty
gurus I'm Michelle Phan so like
obviously I was watching her videos yeah
my skin was just not the greatest
because I wasn't I wasn't taking care of
it so fast forward now I'm 25 and I
still do get acne I still suffer with
acne I have normal to dry skin so I
actually don't have oily skin the reason
why I get acne is because it's like
overly dry so basically the past few
months I have been traveling a ton I had
a bit of a break but before that I was
traveling like all over the world
different time zones constantly on
planes
when I'm on a plane for a long time my
skin tends to react really badly because
of the air and everything and I do break
out when I got back from my trips and I
finally was home and I was able to relax
my skin just went crazy like I broke out
all over my face all over my chest my
shoulders all over my back like all the
way down to my butt I'm not even kidding
you I had never had that bad of a
breakout in my entire life and I'm 25 I
was just like what the actual heck just
happened to my skin I wish I took
pictures but I was just like like I
didn't even believe it and I didn't even
realize it like one day Daniel was
giving me a massage and he's like whoa
babe like your back is really breaking
out I was like what do you mean and I
look in the mirror and I'm just like oh
my god they were everywhere and I just
didn't understand because it's not like
I'm a dirty person I wash and stuff
anyways I realized it was just due to
stress and everything but I decided like
that day that I was really gonna start
taking care of my skin because I was
guilty of falling asleep with my makeup
on I was guilty of skipping times to
wash my face so what I did was I decided
to switch up the products that I was
using so the first thing I decided to do
was I watched I saw so many times in
videos I watched one of Carey's or miss
fashion units videos and I was inspired
by one of her products so I went to
Kiehl's which is the store that she had
a product from and I asked for that
product and then the woman working there
was like well what kind of skin do you
have I was like I don't know like
combination she's aching about what kind
of combination I was like I don't know I
don't know anything so she did this test
on my face where she's able to figure
out exactly what kind of skin type I am
which is normal to dry and then she was
able to recommend any products to use so
I had purchased a few things from
Kiehl's before in the past when I would
go to New York City I'd get a few things
but I didn't know much about the company
or anything like that and so when I was
there I was with my friend Mel and she
was just such a good sales woman she was
sucking me into everything and I was
like okay Alex I'm not gonna be spending
so much money here I decide to buy two
things which was this product right here
and this thing they're both from Kiehl's
I think that's how you pronounce it I
don't know by the way guys there's a lot
of stuff from kills in this video
because I ended up going back and buying
more things it's not a sponsored video
whatsoever they have no idea I'm making
this video I was not paid to say these
things I
totally went out and purchased all of
these products on my own because I just
became obsessed so I really needed a
face wash kind of thing and I had a nun
left I used to use the origins when I
was switching up a lot and I was like
you know what I just need a really good
cleanser that isn't too harsh or
abrasive so she recommended this one
this is the Olufsen French ultra facial
cleanser so it's for all skin types it's
very gentle this huge bottle was like 18
bucks and you need the smallest amount
of it and a little goes a long way so
it's great it's gonna last me so long so
I started using this and I absolutely
loved it so much it's very gentle the
thing about keels what I really like is
that it's cruelty free it's all natural
I know a lot of what like they have all
the ingredients here and I know a lot of
what they are obviously there's some
things I don't know but it's very very
good for your skin there's no chemicals
nothing added so I really like that
about heels I was just like it's kind of
like a lush you know I'm just like okay
I like what you stand for I want to try
something out so she recommended me all
these products and I was like I'm not
spending so much money so I bought two
things but she gave me samples of a
bunch of other things and then I ended
up using up all the samples and going
back to the store and buying all of the
products eventually because I just like
they're all so good so I have this
routine that I do and I have to do it
day and night she told me that my skin
type has to be my face has to be washed
day and night and that's what I do
so I'm just gonna go through my routine
and as if I was washing my face and then
go through the products one by one if I
was wearing make up one day and at night
I want to wash my face I actually don't
really use makeup wipes because I find
they really tug at my skin and this is
new very new to me but this product is
not new because I used to use this a
while ago and I completely forgot about
it so I got this from Sephora this is
the boscia Bosca bushu though I don't
know how to say it makeup breakup cool
cleansing oil and I got this like a year
ago originally it's been in other videos
of mine before because it's amazing and
I don't know why I stopped using things
so this isn't brand new bottle because I
went out and bought another one cuz I
just finished the older one I bought
this because of ingred missglamorazzi on
youtube she recommended this and
amazing so what you do is you take one
or two pumps on your hand while your
face is dry and you rub it all over your
face it breaks up all the makeup and
then you rinse it off and then I put a
little bit more if I'm wearing like
waterproof mascara and I put some more
on my mascara and it turns almost into
like a foam as you're washing your face
and it just feels so awesome it takes up
all the makeup and I'm just I love it
because I'm not like tugging at my skin
with a makeup wipe and then using all
the makeup wipe and throwing that in the
garbage and that goes to waste and
that's not good for the environment all
that stuff so I think this product is
freakin awesome
you might be thinking like oil on your
skin if you have oily skin like new it
doesn't break you out it's really good
it's funny cuz the other night Kat came
over and she needed a makeup wipe and I
didn't have one of those like use this
and she fell in love with it and she
came with me the next day to buy it
because she thought it was amazing so
that's what I used to take off my makeup
then to wash my face was this thing that
I showed you before which is the ultra
facial cleanser and I just take a little
tiny bit of this I rub it between my
fingers and then wash my face and then
when I dry my face I Pat my face dry I
never pull and never tug nothing like
that i Pat my face dry then the next
thing that I do is I use this product
this is a toner and this is by Kota Lee
and it's the moisturizing toner that's
what it's called um the reason why
toners are very important is because
when you wash your face it kind of like
I don't know how to explain it
your face has a pH balance and when you
wash your face it changes the pH balance
by the way guys I'm no expert I'm just
going off of what the lady explained to
me and she was like a dermatologists
person so she explained all this to me
so with a toner what it does is it kind
of puts the pH balance back into place
and also what it does is it takes out
any excess dirt and gunk that didn't
come out when you were washing your face
so I mean it doesn't happen all the
times but sometimes I'll notice like
I'll put it on a pad and then when I
wipe my face I see like more dirt on the
pad I'm like oh wow like that would have
been stuck in my pores if I didn't use
this so it's really important to you
something like this I use this night and
day after every single time I wash my
face so you don't need a lot of it you
just put it all over your face you wait
for it to dry and then
I come in with my serum so this is the
thing that she gave me a sample of and I
used the whole thing and I was like
obsessed with that I was like and I've
used many serums before but there's
nothing that's as good as this in my
opinion the feeling and texture and
everything of it so it's bike heels and
it's called the powerful strength line
reducing concentrate so what the woman
explained to me at the store was that
you have your top layer of skin and then
you have the layers of skin underneath
and what the serum does is that it works
the layers underneath the top layer of
skin so if you have really dry skin
it'll work the underneath layers so that
way when this one comes off and the
other ones push up they're more hydrated
then you're not just like working on the
top layer but then all the underneath
layers are bad and they're damaged and
they're not good and what ends up
happening is that you have a lot of
buildup of dry skin which clogs your
pores creates acne all that kind of
stuff obviously getting hormonal acne is
a little bit different because that has
nothing to do with washing your face
that's just your hormones or you eat all
that kind of stuff so if you guys don't
know I pretty healthy I do have I I do
indulge like I don't ever limit myself
if I feel like having a little bit of
chocolate I'll have chocolate I don't
have cheat days I kind of just eat what
I want to just make sure that I'm
working out and majority of the things
I'm eating is healthy so it's just
pretty balanced diet and so this thing I
read I really liked about it was that I
mean my face feels super smooth like
extremely smooth and it mattifies your
skin without making your skin look dry
and there's no flakiness or anything it
I struggle this is gross but I struggle
with flaky skin in the winter like it
gets so dry I'll wake up with like
flakes it's disgusting especially like
around my chin over here like it just
gets very very dry and especially around
this time I see it happening so this
stuff morning a night before you do your
moisturizer
this helps the underneath layers of your
skin again this is what she taught me
I'm not an expert I just know what she
taught me then comes in with the
moisturizers so I bought this from
Kiehl's I use this only in the more
so only when I wash my face in the
morning it's the ultra facial cream and
it goes with the cleanser so they go
together and I got the small one because
honestly you need the smallest amount
again like it's so worth it plus I
travel a lot so I want to be able to
bring this on the plane with me and the
bigger one would have been too big it's
just a white cream there's really no
scent like okay maybe it smells a little
bit it literally smells like cream like
if you know just what like cream smells
like it doesn't have any good ascent to
anything which I like you need the
smallest amount and it goes on your skin
so smooth and what you need to do is you
need to let it sit for ten minutes
before you apply any makeup if you're
not applying makeup just don't touch
your skin let it soak in and I'm sure
for those of you that have dry skin you
will understand this issue when you
usually put moisturizer on I feel like
my skin just absorbs the moisturizers
super quickly and in like ten minutes
it's dry this stuff sets into your skin
it makes your skin feel super dewy and
super moisturized and just amazing so
this is another thing that I convinced
Kat to buy because she tried it at my
house and she was like oh my gosh
because she has dry skin too and she
like love the feeling of it so just
remember that wait 10 to 20 minutes
before applying makeup over the top
because you want to let it set into your
skin so good this was yeah this one is a
bit pricey this was $33 Canadian which
was like on Arnold 20-something bucks
u.s. but um really really really liked
that and then at night I actually don't
use a moisturizer I do this serum I do
all the steps then I do the serum and
then I actually put on this stuff so
this is the midnight recovery
concentrate it's an oil that you apply
all over your face and I was told that
you don't need to apply moisturizer you
just use this and I've been using it now
for about almost a month and it's
incredible so if you have oily skin this
stuff it just won't break you out
because it's all-natural it's really
good for you it just replenishes the
oils in your skin it helps balance
everything out you wake up in the
morning with your face feeling so good
glowy bright there is no dryness
whatsoever I wake up and my skin feels
amazing I'm not even kidding you like
you guys just it's it's incredible so
again they're not sponsoring this like
they have no idea making this video I'm
being 100% honest I was just obsessed
with
product it's so good so yeah use that
all over my face every single night and
then another thing I do is in the
daytime I don't do this every day I
don't know if I should or not but I use
an eye cream and I don't have the driest
under eyes like I really don't I use
this more for brightening and this is by
benefit it's called it's potent and I
actually just got it sent to me it was
just like in a sample thing so I use it
only sometimes in the morning just a
little bit underneath my eyes not every
single day I don't have like dark
circles under my eyes or anything and I
don't really have big bags knock wood
hmm because I don't want that
maybe it's preventative I don't know but
I use it sometimes if you guys know
anything about eye creams let me know
recommend some I'm gonna check them out
I don't really know much about it once a
week I exfoliate my skin because I
learnt the hard way that you need to
every 7 days there's a cycle that with
your sand you need to get rid of all the
excess dry skin that kind of builds up
on the surface so I got a sample of this
when I was at Sephora a while ago it's
incredible so this is by dr. bran dr.
brand with a tea I don't wanna pronounce
that branded it's called the
microdermabrasion exfoliating face cream
and it polishes and revives dull skin
and reveals radiance so what I really
liked about this with the sample was
that it did not feel very rough on my
skin it did not leave my face red
afterwards I used a lot of exfoliants
before that were not great for my skin I
have very sensitive skin so I really
like this it's derm it's like a
dermatologist brand I got it at Sephora
and I went back about the full bottle
because I loved it and it also really
helps with anti-aging which I do want to
prevent I mean who doesn't
so I'm 25 it's probably a right right
age to start doing this once a week I
will use this and then I just follow the
steps with like my toner my serum eye
moisturizer afterwards so that is what I
do and then again once a week or once
every two weeks out eeks
once every two weeks I'll use a mask so
I have two masks so far that I love
they're both my origins one is the clear
improvement active charcoal mask clear
pores so when I'm having breakouts I'll
use that or this one is the
retexturizing mask with rose clay so
this one really helps brighten your skin
I've talked about these many times in
videos before I mean they're so full and
I've used them so many times you really
they're so worth it
if you guys have any other
recommendations for masks that are you
know cruelty free and that kind of stuff
please leave them down below in the
comments I would love to check them out
I love masks and stuff the last thing I
want to talk about is from Kiehl's again
and this is the best product in the
entire world
it's called this that's in French sorry
I'm from Quebec so everything's like
French in English this is the micro blur
skin Perfector it's enriched with lipo
hydroxy acid bark and lentil extracts
it's basically a skin smoother so even
if you're not wearing makeup and you're
just going out I haven't applied it
today but I don't even know how to begin
with this product like it makes your
skin look photoshopped it makes your
skin like blurred it's crazy you know
the app facetune where you can like blur
your skin this literally does this to
your face so when I'm wearing makeup I
will put this underneath it's kind of
like a primer I guess but it's you don't
need it's not like made to be a makeup
primer and you can use it on your skin
just to blur it out basically without
even putting makeup I don't even have
words for it like I used the sample I
was like whoa that's amazing I used it
three times because I was enough for
three uses and then I went I bought this
was like holy crap that's so good I
don't see if it says something okay so
it minimizes look of pores improving
skins quality over time which is really
good refined skins texture blah blah
blah
smoother all that kind of stuff I could
not rave about this more if you guys are
gonna buy like if you're gonna buy any
product from Kiehl's I would recommend
this one and this one because the other
ones are good but they're good for my
type of skin this stuff is just good all
around so that's the thing I recommend
and my skin has never felt better like I
have no dryness like I would literally
have flakes here like I remember having
a mustache of like a dry skin and I
would put makeup on and my foundation
would just cling to the dry skin and I
was like I'd be so scared to powder my
face after I put
Foundation because I'm like no I don't
want it to get all like cakey and flaky
and gross and it's just not fun so
taking care of your skin for dry skin is
just as important for oily skin yeah I
just I've been feeling amazing and
obviously the acne cleared on my chest
and my back just because I gave it time
I didn't pop them do not pop your zits
that is an issue that I have is I love
popping zits and there's one on my
forehead right now that's like so ready
to pop I don't know if it's showing up
on camera because it's like the window
lighting it's good lighting but there's
a really good one that's like wait I
want to pop it but I'm not doing it and
they just heal way better you have no
more scarring and yeah so I hope this
video helped you guys I know that it's
not like I'm not professional I don't
really know much but this is really what
worked for me if you guys have any
recommendations for products or if you
know anything if you are like an expert
at skincare please let me know down in
the comments if I mess up with anything
or if you have any recommendations like
I said it's getting so dark right now oh
my gosh it's probably in a storm but I
love you guys all so much don't forget
to subscribe you will just be notified
when I upload videos I love you guys all
so much and I'll see you on my next
video
