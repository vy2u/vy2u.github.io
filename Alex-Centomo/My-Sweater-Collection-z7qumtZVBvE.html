channel I am so excited right now
because it's snowing and it's the first
snowfall I'm seeing in my new house so
I'm just really in the holiday spirit
right now this video has been so
requested from you guys and I never felt
like I should do it just because all the
sweaters that I own I've shown in videos
in the past and look books or entron
hauls or on Instagram so there none of
them are new but I oh so many sweaters
so a lot of you guys have been asking to
see my collection which has actually
gone down a lot because recently I
donated like six huge garbage garbage
bags full of clothing majority of them
being sweaters and I also give a lot of
sweaters away to family friends just
because I would the move and everything
I hadn't way too much and I just felt
like I needed to get rid of them but
behind me is my rack of sweaters it's a
problem I still have a lot these are the
ones that I wear on a regular basis I
catch myself wearing sweaters all the
time like right now they're just comfy I
live in a cold climate so why not
especially great sweaters those are just
like so this is a second time in filming
this video I hope it turns out so I have
Daniel over here who's gonna be passing
me the sweaters one by one so I could
show you guys this is not gonna be like
a try on haul or whatever because I've
shown these sweaters what they look like
on me in previous videos and I have so
many just gonna take way too long to
film all of that so if you're curious to
see what these sweaters look like on me
definitely check out my Instagram
because I post pictures with sweaters
all the time or my previous few videos
back to school haul my London haul I
showed a bunch of these sweaters my look
looks I'm always showing the sweaters so
don't worry about that you can check out
all those videos first of all I'm just
gonna start off with like this side and
kind of move this way okay so this
sweater right here is from forever 21
and I bought this online because
everyone always raves about forever 21
online rather than in the store and I
100% agree with them it's so much better
than in store and so I got this one it's
like
a muted mauve color both mom I don't
know how to say it honestly and I got it
in a size large but it's actually still
pretty small so if I were you I would
size up if you like your sweaters loose
like I do because I really can't stand
tight sweaters but this material is so
squishy and so soft it feels like you
know those socks when you buy new socks
and they're really squishy I don't know
if that makes any sense but that's like
the material of this it's just like
squishy and it's really really
comfortable it's a little not cropped I
wouldn't say but it's definitely not
long like it goes to your hips so I just
really like this it's good for traveling
really cute with leggings and sneakers
the next one is this one from Free
People
if you guys recognize this I wore it in
my travel blog travel diary for a New
York Fashion Week I got it specifically
for that trip because I really wanted to
wear this with over-the-knee boots and
it will looked so good so this is like a
muted pink color if you guys don't know
I'm like into muted colors or Gray's and
I like this because the neck is really
big and you can wear off the shoulder if
you want but for me I got broad
shoulders so I really like when things
are a little bit more open especially if
the sweaters looser this sweater is from
Free People again and I bought this one
at the end of the summer or like early
fall and it's really cool it says 92 on
it and the thing I like about this
sweater for one that it's like grey and
oversized like that but it has so many
different colors on it I really like
this maroon color with the yellow and
the dip like the block colors I think
it's really awesome plus it has a
massive hood and this is just so
comfortable and I wear this all the time
just to lounge around in and I could
honestly just curl myself up in the
sweater on its own as a blanket and just
sleep it's so good if you guys really
enjoy just like sitting on the couch
chilling watching movies and it's colder
I would recommend sweater like this plus
it's really cute to wear out to I get a
lot of questions when I wear this out
where I get it where I got this so
um three people they still have it
online I will link all the items down
below of what's still available if
things aren't available I'll try to find
something similar if not I'll just put
the website where you can go and browse
your own sweaters and things that you
like okay this big batch of sweaters is
a bunch of gray sweaters though I think
these are all the cropped ones yeah oh
my gosh okay this is a few years old
from brandy melville and the reason why
I got this it was sold in the summer and
it's really lightweight
of course crop with three-quarter length
sleeves salt-and-pepper material but I
bought this specifically for California
because the weather there is not humid
but in the evenings it's nice to wear a
thin sweater I just think it's like
perfect weather for that so I got this
specifically one when I went to LA last
year it's cute with high-waisted black
jeans that have rips and some black
booties this one's a little bit similar
but I got this off a vintage shop called
Frankie collective so that's shop
everything I owned from there I will be
able to link the exact item but I'll
just link the website so you guys could
check it out for yourself I buy a lot of
my vintage stuff off that website so
this is vintage Polo Ralph Lauren and
it's a cropped sweater with long sleeves
it's waffle material it's like a
off-white light gray with a black logo
here and I think it's just really simple
on cue and I like pairing this with a
leather jacket and jeans I think it's
awesome then I have this cardigan which
I got from Urban Outfitters a few years
ago which has now turned into like a
cropped cardigan because it keeps
shrinking and it's so frustrating
because I wash all my clothes on
delicate cold and for some reason they
still shrink and I even hang them to dry
like I don't put anything in the dryer
and I don't understand how they shrink I
really don't get it but if any of you
have the answer please let me know it's
still really cute though like I like
using it for traveling it's like a big
big cardigan with a big hood it's just
unfortunate that it's so crop now like
it's and like this part here is so long
like this used to be all the same length
how frustrating is that this is from
brandy and I got this three years ago I
think so definitely not available but
I'll link something some
down below it's a really flowy great
sweater it's simple its wide and it's
really lightweight so I actually got
this when I went to Florida a few years
ago and I wore it on the beach just at
night and it was super cute comfy this
is from brandy as well it's their
classic cropped sweater I say crop like
this because honestly it's not that
cropped like just goes towards your hips
honestly the sleeves are nice and long
it's soft it's in New York because I
love New York then this one is from a
vintage shop it's not from Frankie
collective I got it off Etsy so I'll
link that down below if you guys are
curious I don't know if they have the
exact
they make their own crop sweaters off of
like mint like let's say this is just a
vintage sweater I think they crop it
themselves
so this is Fila has a hood it's really
cute I wear this with high waisted
leggings and sneakers this just reminds
me of my mom like this when I was a kid
my mom wearing something like this is
it's so her and I just loved her style
so much I still like her style but I
just feel like my mom when I wear this
like circa 1990s so I just I love it so
much it makes me happy this one was sent
to me a while ago I don't remember what
the brand is product of privilege but it
was sent to me and I really liked it cuz
it has rips everywhere like a huge rip
here a lot of people make fun of me when
I wear this like oh would you get in a
fight with a tiger it's like you know
those classic dad jokes that people
always joke about like when you wear
ripped jeans they're like are your knees
cold like you know so I just really like
it I don't care what people think really
soft like this is the softest thing I
own the inside of it is like ridiculous
I don't know what they do but if there's
if this wasn't ripped I think I would
love it a little bit more just because
of how soft it is but I still really
enjoy the rips they're fun this one I
got from Free People years ago I think
like one of my first videos on YouTube
I'm showing this cardigan is from Free
People and it's like their oversized
grandpa cardigan like look how long this
is
it's really simple I know these cells
stuff like this at urban in forever 21
but I never get any because I have this
one already this is another one of my
favorites it's a main sweater and if you
can't tell I gotta in Maine so when I
was in Maine with Daniel's family and
his sister Trisha and I got the same
sweater just in different colors and we
were just matching and it was so cute I
remember on Instagram a posted like a
matching pictures I think it's still
there it's like us on the beach I just
love it so much it's really big
oversized comfy and gray my god my life
now this sweater was a big investment of
mine because it's from acne studios and
it was definitely on the pricier side I
got it in London last year I was there
before Christmas and I decided to treat
myself
it was the comfiest thing I wore that
trip like this sweater is so warm I
didn't even need a jacket typically I
would wear a leather jacket over it or
something but I didn't have to do that
that's how warm this was I mean you can
tell like the material of acne is just
so well made this one is from revolve
and I got this in the same sweater in
two colors it's I got it also in like a
camel color which is here somewhere
you'll see it in a bit but it's just a
simple turtleneck sweater this is from
lovers and friends and it's the size
large really oversized wide thick long
sleeves which is good oh my god
I have this cardigan from ASOS it's
really long like practically to the
floor right again this was in my fall
lookbook so if you want to see what it
looks like with an outfit check that out
I just posted it like two weeks ago and
it's really really soft oversized long
sleeves super flowy and super
comfortable so I'll leave a link down
below to the exact when I know it's
still available definitely worth every
single penny oh my gosh this thing is
like a legit blanket then there's this
oversized champion sweater that's
actually from the men's section of Urban
Outfitters and I
one that's like dark gray as well but
it's in the wash but yeah it's just
simple super oversized again leggings
sneakers running shoes whatever it looks
cute and this one I just recently got
this from revolt but it's actually from
wild fox and I wore this all over New
York and oh my gosh was ever worth it
guys like this cardigan is so worth the
money it's really really oversized thick
big warm and has a hood but like to be
honest I never wore it I just really
like knitted things so I just posted a
picture of it on Instagram if you guys
are curious to see what it looks like
long sleeves just so cute then I have
another similar cardigan from Windsor if
you guys want a more cheaper alternative
so this one is not as long of the
sleeves and they're a bit tight at the
ends but it's still a long beige
cardigan
this one's really soft it's not as thick
as the other one but it's still like a
thick cardigan so it's still warming up
for the winter this one I recently got
from Free People I think this is my new
favorite sweater that I own it's not
gray actually it's like a brown and
beige color but this style sweater it's
like what I'm wearing right now this
one's from urban that I just got in New
York but this style sweater just is so
90s it makes me so happy and this is the
same sweater that I showed you before
the grey one but this is the brown color
and I had bought both because I didn't
know which one I was going to like more
in person so I just figured I would
return the other one the one I didn't
like as much but I liked them both
equally so much that I couldn't send one
back so I just kept both and I love them
this is from Free People and I got this
in the summer like for back-to-school
time so August and it's a cropped jacket
looking sweater so it's a mustard color
which I don't own many of but it has
really thick sleeves it has a hood and
obviously the zipper and it's cropped
and I think this is so cute with mom
like high-waisted mom jeans and a black
tank top I love that looks so much
especially with the mustard yellow it's
so flattering this one is from Frankie
collective like I said that vintage shop
so it's just a tongue
he'll figure one it's really cropped
like this one I suggest if you have
something this cropped or if you do end
up buying something this cropped wearing
a bra let that's like really low down
like it's kind of almost like a crop top
or all that because you lift your arms
and your boobies are out and this last
one is from three people this is I show
this in my back-to-school try on haul
but it's like a really cool retro
looking sweater with a patch on it and
it just reminds me of like a bit not
vintage but like retro I don't know if
this makes any sense but the colors and
the style the cut I just really really
liked it online so I decide to get it
and I'm so happy it's really soft and no
matter how many times I wash it it just
does not get not soft that makes no
sense but yeah this is the last that I
have and I do have a few more in the
wash right now so unfortunately I can't
show you them but they have been in so
many of my videos I have that look
really oversized Tommy girl one I have I
have a striped one from Windsor which
it's like a gray and black one it's post
on Instagram and I have a the white one
from forever 21 that I recently just
showed in my unboxing haul that has like
the ties on the side it's a little
cropped so those are the three that are
in the wash right now that's it for my
sweater collection it's a little crazy I
know but I just love sweaters so much it
just makes me really happy and that's
like always the thing I gravitate
towards on any kind of website when I'm
shopping online or any any store I just
sweaters and knits that's like my
section anything comfortable
it's my type of thing so like I said I
recently just got this one in
New York it's from urban and it's just a
velvety looking muted green you can like
do that if you wanted to but I don't
want to so I hope you guys enjoyed this
