film this video today I'm also kind of
nervous to be honest just because I find
this topic more of a personal kind of
topic but I know you guys like these
kinds of videos you like me to get more
personal and stuff as you tell by the
title this is going to be my tattoo and
piercings video the reason why I find
this more of a personal video is just
because not everyone agrees with tattoos
and piercings and it's very it's a very
personal preference I am NOT a
judgmental person so I find that tattoos
and piercings are really nice but again
it's all up to personal opinions and if
you are really against tattoos or
piercings or anything like that then
there's really no reason for you to
watch this video because you're just not
going to like it but if you are
interested then just keep them watching
this was one of my most requested videos
and I was kind of putting it off just
because I do find it more personal but
at the same time I would like to kind of
share my experience with you and the
reason why I got my tattoos and my
piercings so I guess I'll start off with
my piercings because it's kind of just
easy to talk about I actually have 10
piercings right now I have most of them
actually all of them are in my ears and
I just have one in my bellybutton so I
got my first two piercings like my first
holes just the regular lobes done in
grade six so I was I think what 11 years
old and I had always wanted earrings as
a kid I thought they were so pretty I
loved looking at different earrings and
everything like that and my parents run
against it they just didn't pierce my
ears as a child they're kind of like
okay once you're old enough and you
really feel like you want it then you
can get it so after like months and
months of asking and really want to
himmat years pierce my mom actually went
with me to get them done and she
actually about hers redone because her
holes had closed up I was really happy
when I got them done I got to wear like
all these different kinds of earrings I
still love wearing earrings bumblebees
and ladybugs and all that stuff a few
years later when I was in high school I
really wanted to get my second piercing
done my parents weren't against it or
anything I was 16
and I kind of just did anyways without
their permission but they weren't like
unhappy or anything like that so I got
those two done and then like a few weeks
later I got my third lobes done because
I just really really liked that and it
was almost like an adrenaline rush for
me and I wanted a lot of piercings
I love piercings um the only thing is
now I don't really wear my second or
third hole anymore as you can see my
videos I normally don't I put them in
for the purpose of this video I just
kind of throw in whatever earrings that
had just to show you but I normally
don't wear them anymore a few years
later once I graduated high school I
really wanted to get my tragus peers and
it's just a little stud I just thought
it was pretty hain wise I don't find
piercings hurt I'm probably not the best
person to ask for this because I have a
pretty high tolerance of pain level I
got that done really liked it um didn't
hurt I did hear like a crunchy noise
when the needle went through but I was
like oh okay a year later I got my rough
piercing done which is the one over here
and this one actually took a long time
to heal for some reason I don't know why
I think my body was just rejecting it it
kept creating bubbles even though I was
cleaning it like exactly how they said
this one I didn't find it hurt it was
just weird because it's like a weird
section of your ear I don't know I
really really liked it and I thought it
looked super cool and then a few maybe
like half a year later I got my conch
done which is just the one that goes
through your ear like this and I saw
this on tumblr I believe and I fell in
love and I was just like I'm the kind of
person that I'm very spontaneous so when
I see something I'm like I'm gonna get
this done and yeah those are all the
piercings I have on my ears and then my
bellybutton ring I bought done when I
think I was 16 years old so I think it
was like after my like second holes I
got my bellybutton get done I'd find it
hurt it was obviously it's like an
uncomfortable feeling because you're
putting you're sticking a needle through
your body and putting a piece of jewelry
in the hole but I didn't think it was
anything painful and it's like a split
second like this and it's over with
those all the piercings I had I actually
stopped my tongue pierced only for a few
months it was more of just like an
experiment I wanted to see what it would
look like and
it was okay I mean I just didn't really
like myself I didn't think it suited me
my parents did not like that piercing at
all
so now on to my tattoos which is like
the main reason why people ask me about
my tattoos all the time so I actually
have three tattoos and there are
definitely significant meanings behind
each and every single one of them before
I get into it I just won't explain that
where I'm from you need to be 18 years
old to get a tattoo on your own but if
you're under 18 you're allowed to get
that tattoo if you have a parent's
permission or if they're there with you
if they sign a paper so the first tattoo
I got is something that it wasn't
spontaneous I always knew I wanted to
wanted a tattoo and it was just
something that I thought of for a couple
of weeks and was just like you know what
I'm gonna make an appointment and I'm
gonna go in and see and if I'm too
nervous or whatever then I'm just going
to leave because you're allowed to do
that now keep in mind that tattoos as
you all know are permanent they're not
like piercings where you can just take
them out after a few years and they'll
close up and go away a tattoo is
permanent you can get it removed with a
laser but it's very painful very
expensive and I think it leaves a scar
so I mean in the end you can't really
get it removed I know the trendy thing
right now is to get tattoos little
tattoos dainty tattoos everywhere super
trendy don't just get a tattoo to get a
tattoo I mean if you really want to do
that it's fine again it's all up to
personal preference but for me it was
something more meaningful it was
something that I wanted for a while and
it was just something that I just had to
do so I made the appointment and you
also want to do your research into the
place that you want to get a tattoo done
as well as the artist and I think every
tattoo a parlor has portfolios with all
the artists artwork because some artists
are better at you know writing some are
better at drawings some are good at
everything but you want to make sure
that you find someone that you really
like and trust and that's what I did so
I went in and I found a girl that I
really liked and also my friends had
recommended me to her I went in for my
appointment and I told her that I wanted
a peace sign I wanted a small peace sign
on my like lower hip and she drew it for
me put the stencil on
just like do it I just wanted it so bad
so she did it and the pain was not bad
again I'm not the best person to talk
about pain cuz I really did not find it
hurt it's just like an annoying like
scratchy feeling that's basically all I
could say it's very small as you can see
it's a pretty small tattoo so the reason
behind the peace sign is that I'm a huge
believer in peace this sounds so strange
talking about so at the time when I got
my tattoo I was going through kind of a
hard time with friends and even my
friends with each other there was just a
lot of negativity surrounding me and not
just because of me just because of a lot
of different circumstances and stuff and
I just wanted there to be peace and I
knew for me even if no one else was
going to fuse like see it that way I
knew for myself I needed kind of a
reminder to keep peace with people to
not start drama this is kind of like my
motto if you're if something upsets you
in the moment and you're very angry and
you want a lot of show and come back
with something to insult them or
whatever or you want to do something to
make them upset just because they hurt
you don't this is what I do so if
something like that happens to me I wait
24 hours and if 24 hours passes by and
I'm not upset I'm not upset anymore then
it's not worth it because if you're
gonna lash out in the moment and be
upset and do something really wrong then
you do things you end up regretting and
so I decided that I was gonna start
living my life where I wasn't going to
be getting upset over silly things I was
going to start living more positively
and not lashing out in the moment
because I just found it created so much
drama around me and it's just not good
for you so that was something I had been
practicing on myself for a long time and
I thought the peace symbol was like the
best thing I'd been obsessed with peace
symbols ever since I was a kid like I
used to draw them all the time so that
was again something I just really wanted
the second tattoo I got is my wrist
tattoo and a lot of people ask me about
this because it's a lot of pictures on
Instagram as well as all my videos you
see this tattoo whereas the other two
you don't see so this is actually the
own symbol and if you don't know the own
symbol is there's a lot of meanings
behind it obviously there's a main
definition but there's a lot of meanings
to rounding this
well if you guys are familiar with
meditation and you know the sound to
release energies hmm
you know that own sound that's what this
meaning is the ohm sound the reason why
I really wanted it is for a definition
that I believe in which is total and
inner peace so when you are meditating
you are able to kind of let go and let
your self kind of detach from reality
and get into another state of
consciousness basically I just wanted to
be at peace with myself inside because I
was dealing with a lot of issues as a
teenager being in my early 20s there's a
lot of stuff that goes on mostly in my
late teens um I was dealing with a lot
of things and those are very personal
things and I just wanted to be at one
with myself and be happy and content and
be able to let go let go is so important
for me my grandfather used to always say
it letting go just to let go and to be
happy and be at peace with yourself
again kind of goes with the peace symbol
but instead of being at peace with
everyone else around you you want to be
at peace with yourself as well so that
was a huge meaning for me especially at
the time more so now than anything
because I've been able to kind of not
achieve it but like I'm so content with
myself now and I decided I want to know
all my wrists because it was a constant
daily reminder because I could see it
with everything I'm doing this one again
didn't hurt it took around like a minute
to get done it was super quick and it
just it's my favorite symbol and what I
like about this symbol is that it has
different meanings for everyone so it
can mean something personal to every
single person and that's just what I
really liked about it so on to my third
tattoo which is the one that is my
absolute favorite tattoo out of anything
and it's also the most personal one um
kind of nervous to talk about this to be
honest and I don't want to cry in this
video because I love to keep my videos
positive because I love to be positive
so I'm just going to keep it that way
but just know that this is very personal
to me and I hope you can respect that
and not judge because it's something
that I love so much so my tattoo I
decide to get all my ribs because I've
always wanted to tattoo there and it
reads the wolf that wins is the wolf you
feed
I don't know if you guys are familiar
with a tale of two wolves but it is
basically a story by the native tribe
the Cherokees and it's a story that I
had read and really really connected
with especially at the time so a little
background story
as a teenager I dealt with minor bipolar
disorder I wouldn't say full-on bipolar
disorder it was more like a minor type I
was seeing doctors for it everything and
I was seeing a therapist to kind of help
deal with that because one day I would
be like an extreme happy and then like a
few days later I would just be like an
extreme depressive sad state and I
didn't understand why because I mean I
remember waking up in the morning
sometimes and thinking like why did I
feel so down yesterday so down like as
if my life wasn't worth anything and it
didn't make sense to me because I lived
such a great life I was so lucky and I
had such a great family I lived in such
an amazing country and every I could do
whatever I wanted with my life and I was
just thinking why do I feel so down I
don't understand because I have
everything great in life and that was
one of the things where I had to kind of
learn for myself and realized that it
was a problem in my brain I did have a
chemical imbalance so seeing a therapist
and doctors they really really wanted me
to go on medication just to help even it
out while I kind of finished high school
and finished my schooling and stuff like
that so I could you know be normal and
then I read this story and um the story
really connected with me also at the
time I hadn't watching a crazy amount of
shaycarl videos if you guys don't know
who shaycarl is he is a fellow youtuber
and does like daily vlogs and they're
called the Shaytards
and he's a very positive person he
always says happiness which is a choice
no matter in what situation you can
choose to be happy and if you are happy
and put out happy and positive energy
then good things will come back to you
because karma I really believe in karma
the universe has a way of projecting
things back to you
so if you put out positive vibes
positive positivity will come back to
you if you're just going to sit around
it'd be negative then negative things
are probably it happen to you so that
really kind of hit me and I used to
really think okay I can choose to be
happy and so then I read this story and
it just really connected with me so I'm
going to read it to you because I don't
want to get anything wrong the story
reads an old Cherokee told his grandson
my son there is a battle between two
wolves inside us all one is evil this
anger jealousy greed resentment
inferiority lies in ego the other is
good it is joy peace love hope melody
kindness empathy and truth the boys
thought about it and asked grandfather
which wolf wins and the old man quietly
replied the one you feed so this really
hit home for me because I really believe
that you can choose happiness so like
the old legend says there is a battle
between two wolves when is good what is
evil and whichever one you choose to
feed is the one that is going to win so
for a long time I was like you know what
I don't want to use medication for this
I want to do this on my own
because I believe I can do this on my
own every day I wake up and I think
positive and I just think life is
amazing life is great and I was able to
overcome it
on my own and I am so proud of being
able to do that because that's something
that you know what most people are told
they have a problem they just listen to
the doctors and get their medication
done but I was just like I believe so
much in my brain and I believe so much
that I could achieve it so I knew that
by choosing to be positive that good
things would start happening and just by
surrounding myself by positive people I
kind of cut out a lot of people in my
life that were negative and first a
reason just because I was dealing with a
lot of stuff and I just wanted to keep
everyone in my life you know people that
were good for me and helped me grow and
not brought anything down and stuff like
that so I was just gonna crawl I don't
cry I'm just really happy that I am able
to do something that I love and it's all
because of what you guys are so amazing
you don't understand how
you mean to me every day your comments
mean the world I read through my
comments section daily and even
sometimes when I'm feeling a little sad
or upset I look for your comments and
it's like instantly I feel amazing
because you guys are so sweet and so
loving and it just means so much to me
that I'm able to be honest with you guys
and tell you everything I feel and what
I've been through and to know that you
don't judge me I'm just really proud of
myself and that's something that not
many people can say I guess but I'm
really proud of myself that I was able
to overcome something like this along
with all that bye bipolar comes anxiety
and I struggled so much with anxiety and
panic disorder I would have panic
attacks all the time and I'm able to
control it all now with my own brain I'm
able to just like switch it on and off
and it took a long time but it it can
happen and that's why I'm a huge
believer and willpower me this life is
just amazing there's so many things
you're going to experience and I
remember thinking like and down down
down times and I just wanted to like end
everything I would think like there are
people out here in the world right now
that are struggling to hold on to life
and would do anything to help a life
like I have it's a little full life like
I can live and Here I am complaining
about my life like it would just hit me
and I would say wow you know there is no
reason why I should be feeling like this
I have such a great life and I would
just tell myself it over and over again
to the point where I really believed it
and now I'm able to really appreciate it
and appreciate everyone in my life and
know that everything will be okay I knew
I should know that too I got a lot of
comments from you guys tell me that
you're depressed and all these kind of
things and you just need to know that
life gets better it gets better trust me
I have been through the wringer it gets
better
you choose the path to your own life so
you can decide what to do with it just
know that there are people out there
that wish they could have a life like
you have and you should be so blessed
that you are living in this Jenner
