full room are you coming are you coming
on Tuesday yeah yeah did you go twice by
accident let me just take my mic is on
wait where she be right back what's up
guys welcome back to my channel I'm here
with Karina no it's gonna be it's
currently we have not filmed the video
together in forever yeah you guys don't
know she was living in Australia for
like the longest time so I like lost
touch sure of it yeah but when she came
back we decided to meet up and just like
hang out and we've been like kind of
consistently hanging out now just having
like long conversations and just having
like massive chest literally like
therapy session yes together yeah over
coffee so one of the things we had been
talking about recently was body image
and we decided to film a video on her
channel all about like self-esteem
issues body image social media social
media like what you perceive online blah
blah blah so if you're curious to see
that I will have that link down below
Aurel you can even just click her face
I'll put like an annotation there but I
think it's really important for you guys
to watch that and just cuz I don't know
like I don't know how to express my very
important topic and we think yeah it's
something that especially we're saying
like girls the guys as well something
that affects us also and the reason why
we did that is because I've been getting
so many requests to film an updated
rotini collection and my one that I did
last year which I'll have it linked down
below if you guys want to see it I
didn't do try on just because I didn't
know that was like a thing like I just
kind of showed my bikinis and everyone
was like oh my god this is not a Tryon
and I was like oh I didn't know sorry so
when people ask it now they're like but
you need to have a try on and I'm very
like self-conscious over that so I'm
gonna be straight up like I over the
course of the year have become a lot
more self-conscious of the way
and not that it's like social media's
fault but it's kind of it's my fault for
looking up to certain people or to
certain ways of life and just expecting
my body to look a certain way also
getting comments on my videos saying
that I've gained weight and that it
looks so bad and blah blah blah and it's
made me feel really crappy so I didn't
want to film the video I was like like
yeah I said I'm not doing it we were
having coffee and shoes like oh I'm
actually like terrified of filming yeah
and then I was like you know what I am a
woman I have curves I have an ass I have
boobs
and I have love handles and I've
cellulite and stretch marks and this is
my body so if people aren't happy with
the way I look but that's our issue so
people you want to see what this bikinis
look like on me and hug Karina or
thought when she told when she told me
that she was scared I was like screw it
I'm gonna do with you yeah like in the
past I would have probably said the same
thing I'm like oh god like I don't want
to stand front of camera in my bikini
but yeah that's just it it's like water
we have to hide nothing literally this
is my body this is her body none finger
given we are gonna get into it so
basically I chose six bikinis she chose
six and we're gonna show them should we
start with the tops that we have no
bottom stick yeah there's one that we
both we have a top it doesn't have
matching ball and so here goes um mine
is one of these tops that kind of gums
Peyer like right under like kind of on
your uh what are these calls call them
smiling cheekbone that's the wrong place
because those collarbones um and yeah
super cute has like this little frilly
part along the bottom it's kind of
twisted right now and has a crisscross
back and strikes me where they're from
yeah cool um this one's by mink pink but
I got it off of the revolve website so
that is it has a very nice little
paisley pattern and I loved I love a
call yeah and I like these kind of tops
if you're doing something a little more
active you know it's not going to fall
off your back are you tan with that no
so that's a good question um I actually
have only worn it when like I said I'm
doing kind of active water types right
so um when Joel taught me how to surf
I was where I was wearing this all the
time so surf why
but when I have its complete opposite
yeah it's a bondo orb and oh I know
everyone says I say bondo weird but
really my friend mando is more from
Quebec so that's how we say it cuz it's
French right it's a French word bald oh
yeah you don't say bando noise whatever
yeah it's from Miko and mm I know
Michaels in the sushi shop yeah
mi Koh but I got off to revolve website
and I like this because it really holds
my boobs well and I like the in-between
part here so you don't get a weird band
tan line so I really like tanning with
us because you don't get the tan lines
here but you get like and you can just
still get like yeah what you would get
with a try exactly so it's really nice
for that plus I just really like stripes
and um I typically wear this with a
black bikini bottom which I showed in my
video last year if you want to see that
and I really like cheeky bottoms or my
thing too of choice for tanning yeah and
yeah throw a little salt um everything
will be linked down below by the way
guys this one is from gypsy like see is
in the ocean see yeah oh cool a play on
words um very strappy and cool it's also
reversible to plain black but I really
just there's something I know it's very
different
there's something very different with
this pattern I don't know I really like
the colors um to be honest may be very
honest with you guys I got an extremely
bad burn wearing this one day so if you
ever aren't going to be wearing a
strappy bikini remember to UM put
sunscreen in between the straps oh I was
in the Caribbean and I put sunscreen all
over like a good girl but didn't think
about getting right in between the strap
and I got like I would say it was like a
second third-degree burn it was almost
purple it was so bad
so awesome bikini but remember to put
sunscreen on correctly and has a really
cool top to go with it too
yeah and again reversible to plain black
and has again not the most ideal I guess
to tannin however I have 10 hit before
wasn't too bad um yeah yeah kind of goes
oh yeah
goes around your neckties and also ties
in the back but yeah oh I forgot to say
so this one was gifted to me I'm gonna
be honest with what was gifted what I
purchased myself because I know I got a
lot of comments on like oh my god those
bees are so expensive I'm 26 years old I
have a career if I want to invest in
like something a little bit more
expensive
I will I also own a crap-ton of forever
21 bikinis but that was showed in my
last video so just letting you guys know
this one is from Zimmermann and this one
I bought on my own so top looks like
this so knit crochet not like a like
inside there's a lining but like when
this gets wet it doesn't like dry easily
it's like wet for a long time yeah it's
true especially but it's really
flattering on it's super nice I like the
colors and then the bottoms that go with
it look like this which I got a size a
little bit too big so everytime I tie it
I have to like really tight tight and it
doesn't like is it from Zimmermann is
all about yeah so we go together so nice
it's simply that it's not that cheeky so
I don't typically like to tan and things
like that but it still is really cute so
for like a pool party or like any kind
of I don't know event but is that
bathing suit material or is it yeah push
it no no this isn't crochet my next one
if I can find it is from rhythm um
they're in Australian brand I really
like them they actually had like a shop
near Rose living in Australia so pretty
cool just for summer well of course for
summer it's not for a winter that's for
sure
I'm just loving these colors and floral
I love floral what I really like is the
top it has kind of like it's what's that
cold it doesn't like tie around the neck
or anything the straps just go straight
back kind of like a bra yeah and then it
just has a clasp in the back and yet
they're kind of like on the smaller side
the triangle but it's really nice to ten
and this is probably my favorite bikini
to tenon because it doesn't give melius
intense lines or anything also I like
the fact that there's adjustable things
a lot of DJ's like this it's just one
thing and like it won't ever fit around
my I'm then you're like scared to order
them all online cuz you're like well I
don't know how it's gonna fit anyways
there's three different yeah adjust
adjustable
yes there's three ways to address that
where's that from this is from same swim
oh cool no it's kinda it's almost like a
neoprene here like the in-between and
then it's also roche layer and then like
it's just like textures yeah okay so
when I first saw this beginning online I
thought okay that's totally like a
material like a typical stone super this
is reminds me more like the triangle
bikinis because it's like thicker and
then this parts actual like material
like the white crochet part and it's a
typical triangle bikini that you wear
around the one thing I do have to say
with that is that this is a size extra
small which doesn't make sense that's
not that small for an extra small no I
mean for my boob size yeah like I feel
like I could have gone with a small but
it's pretty big actually so just you
guys I was gonna just compare to them I
guess this is a size small from rhythm
and it's like the same size so they're
small is like they're agri strips yeah
so size down I guess if you it's a good
idea to tell them what sizes we go yeah
um and I have a 34c I think I don't even
lost him at war brawl so I don't even
know but my my boobs are kind of
plunging out of this a little bit the
bottoms they have so many different
kinds of bottoms I got the ones with the
being a like different kind so yeah yeah
they have the exact same style like the
band one that just goes around your hips
not like the tie one this one is just
the simple tie one this one was on the
pricier side again but this is a really
good quality bikini I feel like that
doesn't look like it's gonna wear out
Asians and it's very sturdy so like I
would even wear that cuz like the straps
were thick when I double knot them it
like does not move so I did wore this
when I was like in Turks and we did a
bunch of like um water activities I wore
this bikini and it was great my next one
is actually kind of a mismatch however
they're both black so obviously they
still met um this one is from lovers and
friends um that I got off of the revolve
website as well a little different than
the usual um style that I wear you like
the high NECA yeah I was a good to say
like these all kind of oh no they're not
all awkward next but um yeah
again this is not the perfect one-two
tenon I'm professional you guys all
these what about one cynical girl but
they're so cute
yeah but like you're not always tanning
not everyone puts on a bikini tan not
everyone wants to ten hey please like um
kamesh yeah it's kind of different to
the styles that I usually wear but yeah
I just enjoy the store even with like
high-waisted shorts is cute yeah I mean
it's like a fest I know yeah this is so
DUII versatile and you can sweat in that
and it's like a bathing suit so good I
should definitely wear this is like tops
on yeah anyway I just paired it with um
a high waist bottom again very not ideal
for janani this would be like to go to a
pool party yeah and this one's from
Windsor so very affordable and has the
little straps on the side high waist
it's very cute so my next bikini is a
two different tops and bottoms but I
just wear them together this is Beach
riot I love each size small which is
definitely too small for me I still rock
it but my nipples show if I move in any
kind of position so this is me small so
just letting you guys know um it's cute
I like the color of it I got it mainly
because I like the color which makes
sense I guess that's why you buy bikini
and the pattern is cute and it's just
like a like a nice little triangle
bikini to tan in I got this for a
specific trip that I can't remember
Oh Bali and I wore it in Bali with these
bottoms which are by Ella blue so I
small kind of cheeky well I got bottom
yeah and these are in a size small but
so it's a little like snug on my like
hips my next one is a triangle bikini
I'm sure you guys all know triangle
bikinis
is my favorite triangle bikinis okay
yeah I have a couple okay so I wrote it
and it said black you think this is navy
blue yeah okay ever every tuck it's navy
blue every time I wear everyone's like
that's baby blue and I'm like Mary oh
it's black I love this blue anyway you
guys pull whatever color you want but um
these are like the newer triangle
bottoms that have more of a cheekier oh
I didn't know they had that being one
thing I don't know the triangle bottoms
before I really disliked the triangle
bottoms cuz I just my butt just
disappeared and it was like smushed like
a pancake whatever
I still wear them but these are much
more ideal yeah so has a smaller bottom
and as if you don't know of triangle
bikinis they're kind of this neoprene
kind of like swim and awesome see what
the hell them wetsuit wetsuit thank you
I kinda got wetsuit material so it's
much bigger and then the top to match
and as most triangle bikinis do they
have a little a little clasp in the back
my next one is actually was a gift when
I did the revolve in the Hamptons thing
they surprised me with us in the room
and this is the bottom and this is the
top I would have never in my life ever
thought to get a bikini like this that
looked like this or this color cuz I was
like it's I thought it was weird but I
tried it on and it looks so good and
then the top is like just the same kind
of color that's small yeah this is small
but it's still like you could stretch it
out yeah yeah
oh there you uh might just it's really
flattering on I've line is it a size
small small and the bottoms I think are
the same small yeah who a from revolved
with my horse swim cor II swim okay and
this is my last one I love this one
that's when you one Griesa yeah oh um
it's author of all website as well um
and it's by their in-house brand
Tularosa so I small so cute this look
like I don't know I just think it's cuz
I got the shoulder yes so why we're off
the shoulder but I think you could also
wear kind of like right on the shoulder
and I'm online I think when I got it I
saw that it's like worn this way but you
can also wear it with the tie in the
front and I've actually worn it like
that a couple of times
that's so cute though um yeah I just
absolutely love it I wore in Greece he
never knows like where did you get you
guys so it's so different and it's like
it's a it's not a bathing suit material
it's kind of like a I don't know how to
describe it it's not crochet it's just
like it feels almost like it's gonna
sound really dumb but like a carpet
almost like it yeah no actually that's
not that dumb has got out feels so
that's the top and at the bottom super
cute too oh my leg have you thought like
the frills around and yeah it's super
tickling you might not know which side
is the front and which tie to sit back
but um yeah I just absolutely love how
this one fits and how I feel in it wow I
like the thicker band yeah it's
different and yeah that's probably my
favorite bikini yeah so the last one I
have to show it's not a bikini some
one-piece and I'm sure most of you will
recognize this from my Turks and Caicos
video but this is by far my favorite
bathing suit ever I also like that it's
reversible so you can wear stripes if
you wanted to that is so nice so it
looks like this in the front it has this
really amazing crochet like detailing so
and then the back is so beautiful this
is what it looks like this one is very
very pricey but I do if you have the
money and you want to invest in a
one-piece bathing suit I say 100% this
one because it is such good quality I
have worn it to like on every single
like water activity possible and it does
not fall off at all I don't know what
size I think this is a size gonna have
because which I mean I could size up a
little bit because I'm like longer I
think but a pentile like you oh yeah I
find it looks really nice so for me I
just really like this being sue a lot
and if you don't want to invest that
much money in a bathing suit
I know Urban Outfitters has a ton of
full like a1 pieces that are very very
similar cut and a lot cheaper just not
the same sort of like crochet style but
still like a really like nice cutout
