channel this video is a long time coming
I know it has been so requested by you
guys and I do win every single summer
around this time of year so that's why
I'm doing it now I'm very confused so
because a lot of you said you're going
back to school in a few like in a week
or in two weeks duh stresses me out cuz
like when I used to go back to school it
was like end of August beginning of
September time like not beginning of
August so like that just seems crazy to
me that's so early August still summer
in my head so that's why I'm doing this
video now but let me know if you want to
see some back-to-school videos because
that is definitely something I want to
start doing again that being said the
bikinis that I have have never been
shown before on YouTube I do have a few
that I've kind of hauled throughout the
month if you guys want to check out my
previous haul I'm sure you'll see them
there but some of these you might
recognize from Instagram other ones
maybe I've never shown them before I
don't know but this is a Tryon bikini
haul so if you are offended by seeing
like boobs or I mean not full boobs or
like cleavage and like a butt up close
or like you know scandalous stuff just
cook away there's no point in watching
this because clearly in a bikini that
won't look like but it's not then just
continue watching okay so I have this
like drawer full of bikinis this is
because I like to keep it organized I
don't know why I'm showing you this the
first one I have is from Asahara ray now
this one is very confusing like okay so
this is the bikini top it's really cute
it goes off the shoulders and it's
cropped the only issue with this top is
that it really shows your nipples so I
have to wear a bra with it which defeats
the purpose of it being of some suit but
then again I'm not going to be canning
and this because it like goes over my
arms I just use it as a top but I think
it's so cute I really like it and it's
just like waterproof so why not sohara
Rae is more on the pricier side these
bikinis that I'm showing you I
definitely are on the more pricier side
but that's just the bikinis that I like
I've owned literally 15 pairs of forever
21 bikinis and every season I have to
switch them up because they just are so
crap material like
shopped at forever 21 bikini like their
bikini collection in a hot minute it's
been a while so I don't let me know if
you think the quality has changed but
just for me personally it's not the
greatest so I prefer to lean more
towards specific brands we know they're
last a long time the bottoms that go
with this are very cheeky and very high
so they're actually this velvety pink
material as you can see they go really
really high up on the on the hips so it
really shows off that figure even if you
don't have hips and makes it look like
you have hips and the back is very
cheeky obviously but I really like this
for tanning I think it's great high
waisted bikini bottoms yes so into those
this is from ELF space and I absolutely
love this these are the bottoms and I
don't know if you can tell but they have
a really really cool material it's
flattering you're cute not the best to
Kannon but I think it's awesome and then
the top is like a very sporty top and
actually looks really cute with shorts
so I kind of sometimes just wear the top
with shorts or I sometimes run in the
top because it's waterproof so sweat
proof and it just like holds everything
together and I think it's super stylish
so I have two more from Elle space I'll
show you guys this one first because I
love the color the bottoms are very
simple they're just the classic bottoms
they have no tie string I mean they're
pretty full coverage on the butt this is
the top I think it's so nice because of
the frills on the shoulders really cute
plus it's awesome because it does have a
adjustable strap in the back and I did
take all the padding because I honestly
really don't like padding and bathing
suit tops it just really annoys me and
this still does give really good holes
and coverage and it doesn't look bad
without the padding in them plus it's
easier to wash that way the last one
from ELF space is this black bikini I am
obsessed with these bottoms I wear them
all the time
they're really high up on the hips and
they don't have like the biggest song
but they definitely like our chi-chi's
that's for sure
and sometimes I'll bring the thing down
like that if I want to ten it doesn't
make it a bit loose because it's
supposed to be high up like this
but it's super flattering on and then
the top is this really sporty top which
again I used to running sometimes and
it's reversible so you have this on one
side and then the insides completely
black but I love the back detailing it
just has these straps and I think it's
really fun and unique but for some
reason more than all my other bikinis
this one gets the most compliment this
one and the red one that I have so
people just seem to love this
and then the red one which is by revolve
actually and I'll show you guys well it
was I think of thing soap opera bulb so
when I went to the Hamptons ship they
had it in my room for me and in spite of
the brand bond I swam so I'm not sure a
brand that is but this is the top okay
it looks ridiculous like it looks so
little but I promise you guys like a
stretch its material of life so it looks
crazy but it's so beautiful it reminds
me of what's that show they're running
on the beach Baywatch
you know that like the rock Baywatch
suit I love it so hot red so pretty very
sporty and then the bottoms are just
very cheeky they match I love it and
this bathing suit with the black one I
get so many compliments when I wear it I
do wish I got a bigger size in this I
think this is like a size extra small
and I'm typically a small on the bottom
and medium on the top so everything that
you see is like small and a bottom
medium on top except for this one I
think they're both extra small so they
are a bit snug but it doesn't look
horrible it's actually very white who
really cares in all honesty like my
boobs aren't flopping out of it it's
more just the back look I have a little
bit of likho as I call them like your
skin goes over the back but that doesn't
bother me so then this one is also
gifted by revolve so cute is by the
brand lovers and friends oh these
bottoms are medium that's why they're so
big okay I was very confused really
really cute they have these stars on
them it's just a simple material then
one downside of this bikini is that it's
like a material so it does absorb a lot
of the water and it takes a
to dry and then the top is I wear this
as a shirt because I mean I've worn it
as a bathing suit but it's kind of
frustrating because it does take forever
to dry but when I can I just take my
arms out of the sleeves and like let it
be a tube top on me and it's really
awesome and wearing it as a shirt no one
would know it's baby so you really get
like a two-in-one experience with this
bikini that's pretty awesome the last
two items I have or just tops and
they're by the brand frankie swimwear
I've had being switching them before
this one is awesome because it has this
tie in the front which i think is so
cute it gives like a different twist to
the bathing suit plus the color is so
pretty
and I really love the sporty vibe of it
if you can't tell by like these bathing
suits I'm relating to that like sporty
vibe or freely vibe you know just kind
of different than the basic bathing or
basic bikinis that I used to have in the
past but yeah this one's so cute
that word mean and then the other one is
very confusing but you'll see on the try
haul try on haul you'll see what you'll
sleep on the Tryon part what the heck
okay it looks like this and then it ties
around the back very confusing but also
really sexy and I like that sometimes I
like to be a bit sexy in my bikinis and
that is everything that I have that's
new that has not been shown on my
youtube before everything else in here
has in this like bucket thing that I
have so I will go ahead and link my
other to try on hauls for bikini
collections down below if you guys want
to check those out or you could check
out my Instagram or my previous hauls
you'll see like one-piece suits and
stuff that I've shown but yeah I'll have
links to everything will sit down below
let me know if you guys find bikinis
from like really inexpensive places like
you know that's forever PacSun or
something that you think the quality is
good keep in mind I do wear my bikinis
very often because I do travel a lot so
they're constantly being worn in like
the ocean and pool and stuff so I want
things that are going to last me a long
time and that
aren't going to like break within three
washes and/or saved a lot in color so
way I'm very open to knowing what you
guys suggest give this video a thumbs up
if you enjoyed it and let me know in the
comments down below when you guys start
back to school I know I've been asking
this question a lot but I'm really
curious to know when I should start
uploading my videos because I get like
both sides I get like I should start now
but then I also get people being like no
like schools in a month you know don't
start now start in like a few weeks so
whatever you guys want all I do the
majority and that whole thing also I
just want to say my friends Tessa's hot
are in town in my hometown this weekend
so let us know what you think we should
get up to because that would be so fun
to get your suggestions I love you guys
I'll see you all MINIX video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
