one thing twice here hey guys so
starting off with what I like to wear
when I work out I really like to our
sports bras and that one is just from
Victoria's Secret and then these are
some really old old old shorts I got
from forever 21 of course I got to
listen to my music then I just put on my
socks and my shoes and I'm ready to go
of course I have to listen to my 8-track
playlist summertime fitness I just love
this for working out and then I like to
put on a t-shirt over top of my sports
bra because it just makes me feel more
comfortable especially if I'm going to
go for a jog and usually I like to jog
in the morning around 40 minutes just a
light jog to get myself warmed up before
I do any other exercises
yep I died that was hard I like to lay
out a yoga mat before I do any other
exercises because it's more comfortable
that way and I don't hurt myself and
then of course I drink some water now on
to some abs so I really like to start
off with crunches because I just find
they work my ABS really well you want to
make sure that your back is as flat as
possible against the floor because you
don't want to risk arching and hurting
yourself while you're doing these so I
just do 5 by 10 reps that just means I
do 10 crunches 5 times with a break in
between usually around 30 seconds and
then I do the same thing with my legs up
in the air this really works the lower
abs a lot and I do 5 by 8 reps this
exercise really works the whole AB
itself I really find it helps with my
lower abs and my upper abs and I just
really like it a lot and then I do the
Cobra stretch to stretch it all out
afterwards
onto the thighs so this is by far my
favorite exercise to do ever I just
think it looks so funny but it works
really well so I do three times ten reps
of this on one side and then I switch
over to the other side you really want
to make sure that you're squeezing the
inner and outer thighs as you're going
up and down because that's going to work
the best
this one works just the inner thigh but
I find it helps so much and oh my gosh
does it ever burn I usually just do two
sets of twenty five leg lifts and it
works perfectly fine for me because
you'll never catch me up good this is
like the funniest thing ever to watch
but seriously this makes your butt burn
like a crazy I don't even know what word
to say just it hurts so bad
but it's so good now on to some simple
squats
I just really find this works my butt
and my legs and I really like doing this
a lot the proper way to squat is we tend
like you're sitting on a chair you want
to make sure that your knees are not
going over your feet
now on to my favorite part of the
workout is stretching and this is so
important after a workout trust me you
will not feel sore the next day I find
stretching helps so much Plus which is
good for an everyday thing to be
flexible and I usually like to hold my
stretches around 30 seconds each
this stretch is literally the best thing
ever I could honestly fall asleep oh hey
look I did now it's time to walk on your
hands just kidding don't do this if you
don't know how I was just whatever
and then I like to cool off in the pool
I was a swimmer for a long time so I
just feel like I am one with the water
and it's just really comfortable after a
good workout
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
