to film this heatless hair tutorial for
you I know you have wanted this for so
long so let's just get right into it
because I don't really have anything
else to say so why am I doing this okay
so this is actually really really simple
and the reason why I started doing this
is cuz I just wanted to find an
alternative way to curl my hair without
using heat because as you guys know I
tried to go the whole summer without
using any heat which so far I am doing
and I'm really excited my hair's grown a
lot so if you guys are doing that as
well with me then just leaving the
comments below I'd love to see if you
guys have you know tried it out and if
your hair is growing at all basically I
am just doing what every woman did to
curl their hair back in the day before
any like curling irons or straighteners
were invented this is how girls and
women used to curl their hair so I
actually was just watching a movie one
day and a woman was curling her hair
with like little ribbons I'm just like
hey I could do that too so why not so
basically all you need for this umm if
your hair's already dry then you can
just use like a speck this is looks so
big right now but does the only spray
bottle I had so just a spray bottle
bottle to have to hold water for you and
then of course just some like bobby pins
or any kind of pin you guys want you can
even use like ribbons or whatever but I
just find that ball you can sort better
and yeah this is actually there's two
different methods for this some people
like to do it and um do their hair and
leave it overnight sleep on it but
personally I just find that really
uncomfortable and I don't know how
people do it so I mean if you guys want
to try that out all by all means go for
it but this is more of like a loose wave
because that's just what I like in my
hair better and I just find this method
works best for me so the reason why I
have this thing with me right now if you
guys are all wondering like Alex what is
that huge thing like um it's actually
just a hydrate me when I'm thirsty so I
could just squirt into my mouth that was
good
it's actually just a DAB in your hair
because when your hair is dry like it
mine is right now it won't hold curls so
you want to dampen it a little bit so
that when you twist it up the curl
actually stays in your hair so anyways
I'm just going to show you so you can
see what I'm talking about
like my bag piece here yeah make sure
your hair is recently combed out because
you don't wanna have any knots when
you're doing this so you're basically
just gonna like dump in your hair with
this you don't want to completely wet it
but you want to make it so that's damp
just going to brush through it with my
fingers as you can see it's pretty damp
and then what you're going to do is I'm
using two fingers for this because I
want my curl to be a bit bigger if you
want your curls to be a bit tighter use
one finger we basically put your fingers
on the end of your hair like this and
then you're going to start curling it up
towards your face case how could I show
this right now so basically just doing
like big curls with your fingers it does
not have to be perfect trust me the less
perfect it is the better because you
want to be like a beachy wave rather
than like a perfect curl if you want
perfect curls then that's a different
story but see how I got all the way up
to my head then you're just going to
take a bobby pin and you're literally
just going to pin it on top of your head
this is so hard to do in like a camera I
look like a monkey so basically this is
what its gonna look like and guys this
is seriously so funny right now oh my
gosh I look like such a freak but this
is basically what you're gonna do all of
your head sometimes I take bigger pieces
and others sometimes take smaller pieces
I like to really mix it up so I don't
have like uniform curls and also I curl
like up towards my face because I want
the curl to be going away I don't want
to curl inwards because you curl inwards
like this the curls going to go like
towards your face and it's like less
flattering in just in my personal
opinion if you guys like that style go
for it by all means by the way I'm so
sorry if my voice is like raspy I don't
know what's going on it's like
disappearing so again two fingers then
up then up can you see what I'm doing
this little ring like I don't know if
you guys can see what I'm actually doing
here Oh
and then you pin it and you want to put
it to the part that's next to your head
so I got two little curls happening over
here and then you just keep your hair
like this do you guys actually want to
see me do this whole thing cuz like I
got a lot of hair the only downside of
this is that it does take longer than if
you were to just curl your hair but if
you're trying to grow out your hair and
you're serious about it then this is the
best way to do it because it doesn't
damage your hair you get those nice
loose waves without I can't take my so
seriously I'm like looking at myself in
the viewfinder and I'm just like oh my
gosh but seriously like it just helps
dramatically with keeping your hair
healthy I know they're actually like
things you can buy that are like little
ribbons or whatever that you can wrap
your hair around but I mean I always go
for like the method that you can do at
home because this literally like you
don't need to spend any money I mean if
you have a bobby pins laying around at
home if you got water than your said you
don't need to purchase anything with
this so I just like this method the best
cuz it's just like I do it yourself do
it at home kind of thing and you're just
going to do the whole rest of your head
this one's kind of falling so I'll add
two bobby pins like going opposite
directions just for more support so it
stays another good tip for why you need
to wet your hair is because if you do
have layers like I have layers in my
hair it helps keep the layers stuck to
the longer pieces so now that you're
done with all your hair just pinning it
all back and up you're just going to
wait for it to dry and then you're gonna
take it all down also I want to explain
that when I do spray my hair I only
spray from like halfway down because if
I spray up from like halfway to my roots
then that part will Crowell too but I
actually don't want that part to curl I
want that too part to be more straight
and then have the wave afterwards so
that's their only reason why I spray
halfway down also if you want you can
literally just like twirl your hair
halfway and then pin it so it's hanging
like that
that's another good way to do it but
this is just the way that I have been
taught so I'm just going to probably go
do some chores like some laundry or
whatever and then in around 40 minutes
I'll take them down and see what they
look like
okay guys so I just want to do some
laundry and stuff and I actually started
playing with my dogs and a lot of them
fell out so I then had to like redo some
of them but um it's been around an hour
now because since I had to redo a couple
uh feels really funny but anyways let's
see how they're turning out by the way
I'm warning you now it's gonna look
crazy when you take them down the first
time because they've been up for a long
time I'm trying to just carefully so I
don't damage my hair with the bobby pins
I'll do like the front first and then
I'll start doing the back afterwards the
back is the hard part no but once you
get the hang of it it gets easier you
can also ask ask a friend to help like a
parent or a friend just to do the back
for you I used to get my mom to help me
with it because it couldn't reach but
then I just started using a mirror and
stuff and I don't know I'm just after a
long time of doing it you just kind of
get used to it well that turned out okay
and I like to shake it all up this is
basically what it looks like after I
take them all down this is like very
like tight curls so I actually like to
brush these out because I don't really
like the tight curl look but I don't
really brush hard I kind of just like go
over it quickly I don't want to like
comb through it completely I mean this
is basically what it looks like after
all these like little curls the ones up
here because of my layers are gonna be a
bit tighter but as the day goes on they
actually really fall out and it looks
really nice and if you can tell in my a
lot of my pictures the curls have been
looking a little bit tighter but it's
almost like they're heavy so they just
fall throughout the day which I really
like and then to finish it off I add
some sea salt spray or something like
that just to give it a bit more texture
but I mean you guys all know what it
looks like to pick sea salt spray in
your super nice and curly and yeah I
just really like to do this with my hair
obviously if you're going to be doing
this for school it does take a lot of
time so I wouldn't suggest it I might
suggest to do them at night and then
sleep on them and if you want you can
put a shower cap or something over your
head just to keep them in place but at
the same time it's kind of uncomfortable
so um I really
just like doing the other method where
you kind of roll them up halfway and
keep them here instead of on top of your
head you just gotta keep them half way
like they would be in a curl like this
and then you would clip them and they
would just be like hanging here like
that and then you can go eat breakfast
do your makeup and then take them out
afterwards and you should be good to go
this is not supposed to be looking like
you curled your hair it's supposed to
look like very natural and natural curls
/ waves so that's the whole point of the
no heat because I really like the way
that looks it just looks like you have
like natural natural Beach waves which
is so pretty and then especially once
you add the sea salt spray which I'm
going to do after this it's gonna look
really nice so after I add in some of
that sea salt spray it just gives it a
really nice beachy look and it kind of
just looks like mermaid curls I just
really really like it especially for the
summertime this is like my favorite way
to wear my hair just because it's like
natural and no heat and I just really
like the way it looks yeah look it's
mermaid hair I apologize you guys have a
hard time seeing what I'm doing it's
really really hard to show it on this
like small viewfinder i normally use
like two mirrors one in the front one in
the back so I can kind of see what I'm
doing but doing it right here for you
it's actually really hard I didn't
realize how hard it was gonna be
basically I just use two fingers and
roll my hair up pin it with two bobby
pins so it stays against my head while
it's damp you let it dry for around 40
minutes then you take it out slowly so
you don't ruin the curl then you just
kind of finger comb it and it should
turn out like this obviously if you have
shorter hair the curl might look a bit
different but my sister actually did
this one she had shorter hair and it
looked so pretty and I'm not just really
like it a lot I find this look so good
and this is just literally done by
curling it around onto my head so hope
you guys enjoyed this tutorial I
