I'm standing in my bathroom right now
and it's a little dark back there
because um I can't fit a light but I'm
standing here because I decide to film a
cut fun video for you guys if you follow
me on snapchat which you should because
it's a lot of fun I've been posting a
lot of pictures lately of me not wearing
any makeup and just kind of like fun
braids and stuff and you guys have been
tweeting me and commenting on Instagram
in my videos asking me what my skincare
routine is and how I kind of cleared up
my skin if you do know my history I used
to suffer with pretty bad acne and then
I have also like dry skin in some places
so it's very like combination skin I
have found some products that definitely
have helped with that but I also like to
do a kind of no makeup makeup routine
like i used some makeup products but not
a lot and it just to kind of like
enhance your features but doesn't really
look like you're wearing any makeup so i
thought that would be really fun to film
so if you're interested in seeing that
let's just get right into the video for
a no-makeup makeup look you got to keep
your products to a minimal so these are
just a few of my favorite things to use
on some of these days that I don't feel
like wearing it too much makeup so
starting off with putting my disgusting
main up into a bun because it gets so
messy and especially when i first wake
up i literally look like a lion so then
i take my ocean salt by lush this stuff
is super gentle on my skin it might not
be like that for everyone but for me
works perfectly and especially in the
cold winter months when my skin gets
very dry and flaky this just gets rid of
everything and leaves a open canvas for
may make up later on
I love the origins original skin serum
because it noticeably minimizes my pores
improving the look and feel of my skin
and it also adds a really healthy glow
plus the floral and citrus essential oil
blend smells amazing it honestly makes
my face feel like a baby's bottom I'm
not even joking so if you're interested
in checking out this product I'll leave
a link down below in the description for
you to check out because it is available
online and I don't know I love the smell
of citrusy it's tough it's just like my
fav on top of that i put my kate
somerville oil-free moisturizer this
stuff works amazing when my skin is very
dry especially in the winter even though
technically it's spraying it still very
cold where I live and then of course the
origins ginseng I cream it smells like
oranges then I'm obsessed with it and I
just love this for underneath the eyes
now because I don't want to wear too
much makeup I honestly just use
concealer on and no makeup makeup day
because I just want to get rid of any
redness I can around my nose and any
blemishes I may have like these two
random pimples that i have on exactly
the same spot and then I just blend it
all out with a Beauty Blender
now to tackle those under eye dark
circles that I sometimes have and just
to brighten up underneath my eye I like
to put this Maybelline age instant
rewind concealer and I just find it
looks amazing underneath my eyes keeps
them nice and fresh and then I come in
with my benefit brow or gimme brow
because I need to have some color on my
brows or else they're invisible and then
I use a cream blush by Mac this is just
lady blush and it gives a very natural
flush the cheeks which I love
gotta add some highlights so this is
just max soft and gentle mineralize
skinfinish and i love the way this
shines off in the light especially the
daylight actually it's really really
really nice I apply this on the high
points of my cheeks and my eyelids and
my inner corners and it just looks
really nice and because my eyelashes are
honestly non-existent I love using the
new benefit roller lash mascara to just
add some volume and linked to my
non-existent eyelashes
finishing it all off with my favorite
TOS lip balm in the flavor sweet mint I
love the tingly pneus it gives to your
lips and it's just really nice now it's
time to tackle the main oh yes I don't
know about you guys but I love to use no
heat on my hair I just like to have my
hair healthy and try to use as less heat
as possible so braids are my like go to
thing and when I'm not wearing my
extensions I like to just do a regular
side braid so I start off by making a
side part sectioning it off into three
pieces and then I go underneath the
middle piece each time another thing I
like to make sure of is that I don't
twist the pieces as I'm going underneath
the other section I try to keep them as
flat as possible that way when you pull
them out it looks more like flat and big
and I don't know it doesn't really make
sense but that's just the way I like to
do it
before I secure the braid I like to pull
out the pieces and I kind of go crazy
with this I like to pull out a lot of my
hair to make it look really thick and
big but you guys can do whatever you
like if this is just like my favorite
thing to do and then I secure it with a
clear elastic and I'm good to go
I also like to pull out some pieces just
to frame my face and make it look a
little bit more boho and messy just
that's my favorite look and then adding
a little flower crown gives you
something a little different and special
and I think this look is so cute i'm
obsessed with it i am definitely going
to be rocking something like this at
Coachella I'm so excited I can't wait
and if you're interested in where I got
this flower crown I got it from Windsor
last year but they have so many more
flower crowns on the site if you're
interested I just love this look it's
super simple and natural but it looks
really pretty let me know in the

makeup look is or if you have any other
