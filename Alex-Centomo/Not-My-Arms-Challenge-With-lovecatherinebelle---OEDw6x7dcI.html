through what I do every single day I if
I'm wearing makeup that day basically my
like everyday routine and she'll try to
like find the makeup and then put it on
my face but since she's sitting behind
me she won't see what she's doing and so
it's gonna look beautiful babe look for

videos together and I'm pretty sure

up to let us know if you liked it and I
hope you guys are enjoying your day and
let's get started ok guys so I'm just
gonna take off my makeup right now since
i was wearing makeup today and this
video she can't be wearing any makeup so
just think I forgot what I was gonna say
wait put this on and then keep taking
them off after how this is gonna work I
have no idea ready uh-huh
okay put your hands down with my head no
I put my arms right no your has to go
through them all so yeah we sure oh
you're not with the talk hey guys so I'm
here today doing a everyday makeup look
and so I'm going to start off with my
primer oh yeah I'm gonna start off with
my primer um so I just put a little down
my fingers and then I rub it evenly over
my face and make sure yeah you know
spread it all over my cheeks I didn't
rub it a bit in my hair Oh No yay evenly
distributed now I take my foundation
that I normally use which is this estee
lauder whichever one does matter estee
lauder foundation and I you normally
apply this on the back of my hand just a
little bit it comes up kind of fast so
be careful about that guys just a little
bit like that perfect and then I take my
beauty blender or my my makeup brush
whichever one it doesn't really matter
and then I just you know spread around
the head and then I apply it onto my
face so starting off on the cheeks it's
the best area to apply it I just do
little circular motions on the bottom of
my jaw you know want to spread it around
to make it like a beard and then you
know get some on my forehead gotta cover
those zits up so I like this mac
prolongwear concealer that you just pull
off the top you don't need to twist it
and then I just put a little bit on my
hand like that yeah
mm-hmm and then I put the cap back on
and then I just apply to the areas where
I need it most so on my sit under my
eyes around my nose and anywhere like
that so I just dab it all over that
around my nose and then you gotta do a
little bit under my eyes so you can get
rid of those like dark circles yep so
good now to set the foundation I use a
powder um this one is one of my
favorites the Revlon nearly naked powder
I usually use this with a big fluffy
brush doesn't really matter what are you
liquids you could use a kabuki brush or
a big fluffy brush sometimes I find it
really hard to open so I really have to
use my muscles which I don't really have
so got open it up and I find a big
fluffy brush and I just you know mix it
around in there and then I apply it to
my face generously get away that shine
oh yes on the eyebrows especially
important Oh in the mouth it looks
really good guys um the next thing I
like to do is apply some bronzer you
know to contour the cheekbones and the
you know the temples so I like my NARS
Laguna bronzer is definitely my favorite
bronzer that I have and I take a you
know an angled brush or contour brush
whatever you want to use and I just like
to suck in like this and then I apply it
so pretty can't forget to the other side
so contoured I like to apply some blush
after i touch my hair because um this is
one of my favorite blushes it's called
prism by mac and it's a powder blush and
i just use it with whatever brushing
want this little brush is great so i
just smiled upon the apples of my cheeks
and I apply it like that you know like
to touch to make sure I know where the
apples are right good perfect and then
the next thing I like to move on to my
eyes so first time I can cry my eyes
with
not my palate like to private with my
NARS primer which is really great if you
have oily eyelids so I just apply it to
my eyelids like so making sure I get it
all on perfect mm-hmm you're my I might
be covering my face a little bit oh it's
great perfect so the next thing i like
to use i was high naked 2 palette and i
just look through the colors and I
decide which color I like the best so I
like to apply this color to my eyelid
because it gives a really nice sheer
glow and it's just very youthful and I
like to take a darker color with the
same brush and then I put apply it to
the outer V of my eye and then that I um
it just really deepens up the look and
it gives you like a really nice um
smokey eye look then I do the same to
the other eye mm-hmm it's really nice
and blended so next I take my mascara
and sometimes I like to curl my lashes
before i do my mascara and sometimes I
don't need you so it depends on the day
I think today I might curl them okay am
I not or might I don't know no not gonna
girl today so I just take the mascara I
like to use the small piece first to do
bottom lashes so I'd look up and then I
kind of pull the skin down just like
that I like to use my left hand to do
this way mm-hmm you got a really kind of
press real so you won't see it good now
I do this side mm-hmm got a little bit
of lashes and I do the bigger side to do
top lashes so I look kind of down
perfect get a little bit of my hair it's
all good now for the eyebrows this is my
favorite part cuz I I find I'm very bad
at doing eyebrows but um sometimes yeah
I've been working on it so I'll
hopefully it's a little better so I take
the little brush that's in there and I
just you know I do the shape of my
eyebrow I take this lighter shade mmm
just like that and then I like to form
the shape of my eyebrow so nice get a
really natural arch arch arch I use any
color I'm not normally um Helen Morgan
choose your color for the fall months
you know open it that's the same perfect
so this one I'm gonna like do open my
mouth a little Angus and i'll apply it
get it on my teeth i have smile actually
it's probably easier gotta really
applies thick layers if you don't press
hard enough and i won't really show yeah
I never on my lips together and smile
and that is the finished look if you
really like this look give it a thumbs
up and let me know what you think I
think it's very natural and perfect for
the fall mostly for any season but
definitely for the fall because the lips
and yeah I can't wait to see this ok so
tired how do I look wait do we get it I
feel like I should open to go get my
scare all the way down here oh wait via
lips oh wait that's just a bizarre okay
is it me you look better than i'm really
not it's just decide
oh oh yeah it's not my bad though right
