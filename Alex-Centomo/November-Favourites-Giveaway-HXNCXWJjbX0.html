weirdest intro I've ever done in my
entire life as you guys all know
November has come and gone it's December
now which I'm very excited because I
love Christmas time even though I'm not
excited for the snow I like snow around
Christmas time but then the snow just
last forever where I live like literally
till April and it's so depressing
because it's so cold and it's not pretty
snow after it's just dirty and wet and
cold in november i have been trying out
new things and i have a few favorites i
also have a cold so i apologize if I'm
kind of stuffy but comes with the cold
months so in the month of november i
decided to try out different beauty
products so i go through phases I'm not
the kind of person that sticks was one
thing for a long period of time like
years and years and years and then try
something else like I love to switch up
my products I love to try new things um
usually when I find something I really
love I'll usually continue to buy it but
I won't stop me from trying new things
like I'll always get samples and stuff
so the beginning of november i went into
sephora and i got a few things samples
and stuff and fell in love with a bunch
of different products so there are two
things that i have been loving from the
brand philosophy so I don't think I've
ever actually talked about philosophy on
my channel before but it's their
products that I've used for a long time
um in the shower mainly and I think
maybe in an old video I probably talked
about something I'm not sure but there
are two things that I've been absolutely
loving I'll probably continue to use
them throughout december so the first
thing I'm going to talk about are these
cleansing wipes these are the purity
ones they're the purity made simple
one-step facial cleansing cloths this
stuff is great I know a lot of you guys
know that I use like an oil to take off
my makeup and stuff but to be honest I
don't use that all the time because i am
lazy i'm just gonna put it out there i'm
a lazy person i just am especially at
night when I'm cozy in bed and i'm
watching once upon a time and I don't
feel like getting up to go do the oil
thing happens once in a while so these
things have come in a lot of handy
panties they have come in handy
especially when I travel because I can
bring these on carry on and I can't
bring the oil on a carry on because it's
too big the bottle so these things are
great because they remove oil they
remove dirt and makeup all-in-one and
also you don't have to rinse your face
after you use them so they're perfect if
you're just kind of like in a rush
you're exhausted but you don't want to
go to sleep with your makeup on you
could totally use these but you can also
use them just to freshen up your face
like sometimes when I'm flying I'm not
wearing any makeup but I'll and really
over and I just feel like my skin is all
is this because of the plane so then I
use just one of these and it just
freshens it all up and it feels a lot
better so very simple gentle you can use
them on your eyes they don't irritate
your eyes on especially for sensitive
skin really good for that because I have
extremely sensitive skin especially
around my left eye for some reason I
don't know why it's always tearing it's
always like hurting I use actually as
one of these because the cloths are
really oversized so you don't need a
bunch of them and they're so soft I love
the feeling of them on my skin then
along with that product I actually
picked up this a little goes a long
freaking way this is the purity made
simple it's the three-in-one cleanser
for face and eyes so again it's very
gentle it doesn't irritate your skin if
you have sensitive skin you'll be
totally fine you can use it around the
eye area and it won't irritate anything
which i really like about that it's
great because it dissolves dirt and oil
and makeup kind of like the wipes but
this is left the cleanser so you can
just use it all of your face and it
cleanses as well so it's really good
it's also made with 12 essential oils in
it i believe ya 12 essential oils and it
just helps calm and soothe skin so you
feel really good afterwards i usually
use this at night because i like to feel
relaxed when i go to bed so you can
actually use this instead of the wipes
like i use these when i'm lazy like i
said but if i'm actually washing my face
this is a three in one thing so i can
use it to wash off my makeup and then it
washes actually washes my face it's also
a really good toner so there's three
things in
really awesome and I just like the way
it smells and it feels on my skin I've
also teamed up with philosophy to bring
you guys a giveaway so I will leave all
of the information listed down below in
the description for you guys if you are
interested in entering the giveaway I'll
be like as soon as you open the
description the first thing you'll cease
all the rules okay another kind of
skincare product that i've been loving
lately but mainly for your body is from
soap and glory and it's the righteous
butter actually got this container for
travel purposes and i ran out of it but
then I also have a big container so I
kind of just keep refilling it because
it all the time I travel such a good
scent I use it all the time after i
shower or wash my body take a bath
whatever I just slather it all over my
body in my hands my feet and it just
keeps my skin super moisturize it smells
amazing it actually makes the room smell
good so a lot of the times when I'm
traveling I don't like the scent of like
hotel rooms sometimes and I obviously
don't bring candles with me or whatever
so if I have friends coming or whatever
all I put the cream on and then they
come in wow it smells so good just like
ya know so yeah this stuff is like
really really soothing really
moisturizing um it doesn't like I first
when you put it on it's quite thick you
just have to look kind of like let it
sit and then it feels incredible
afterwards and kind of last throughout
the day so my skin never feels dry or
gross I'll usually just put this on
after i shower so either at night or in
the morning so if it's at night I'll
sleep on it my skin feels really good
the next morning or if I shower in the
morning it feels good throughout the day
so either way it's really really good I
don't know how much the small one is
I'll leave it all the description for
you guys to check out but yeah love it
so I only have one beauty product that
i've been really really loving for the
month of November because I the other
things I've been loving are kind of like
the same things I was loving the
previous month so it's not different but
something that I've been switching up is
this lip pencil / lipstick / creohan
thing is by elf cosmetics and it's
called the matte lip color and it's in
the color wine so it's a really oh my
god it's really
kind of cracked and gross I wore it in a
previous video and a lot of you guys
were complimenting me on it so it's just
super easy to put on it's very
moisturizing it's matt but it doesn't
leave your lips feeling like crunchy not
crunchy what's the word I'm looking like
dry it you know that feeling I hate that
and plus elf is really really affordable
so I really really really like this
color and it just is perfect for this
time of year I get so many compliments
on it and it looks very similar to diva
by Mac except it's like a quarter of the
price not even like it's so so cheap
compared to Mac so I really like that
love it plus it's just easy to like
throw in my makeup bag at ass matte
black which is it just looks pretty look
at this I just love a look at that ok so
i have to fashion favorites the first
one being this cropped sweater from
brandy melville looks like this i'll
insert a picture right here but that's
when i wore in LA but i literally been
wearing it ever since i got it in
november all the time with high-waisted
pants when I'm in Montreal or shorts in
LA and I just love the salt and pepper
look of it but i also like that it's
more light wash and it's just really
comfortable it's not that thick so it's
not like too chunky it's pretty thin
really flattering on and i don't know i
love this color gray it just really goes
well with my skin tone then the next
thing i want to talk about is kind of
awkward because i feel like no one
really talks to all this kind of stuff
on youtube but it's actually a pair of
underwear that i have so okay this is
from aerie and they have those deals
where it's like what is it like seven
for twenty seven or something like that
where you get like seven pairs of
underwear or thongs or whatever for like
a really good affordable price so these
are literally a knockoff of the Calvin
Klein if you can't tell they look almost
identical I own Calvin Klein underwear
there honestly the most comfortable
underwear as I own but these are
identical and they're so much cheaper I
got these and honestly a million
different colors this is just one of
them and I just really like the way this
fits sometimes I don't feel like wearing
thongs sometimes I feel like wearing
full coverage underwear because i'm lazy
and I don't feel like having a piece of
string up my butt I'm sure you guys all
know what my next thing is what I'm
going to talk about because I've showed
them in like literally every video since
i got them but they are these booties
from Sailor all I'm just so obsessed
with them i love them so much they're so
calm
durable and just so amazing you guys
don't know if this is the first video
video you're watching these were gifted
to me and there are the best gift in the
entire world they're like literally I
always say this like they're so
expensive but if I if ever I were to
lose them or someone would just steal
them I would buy another pair just
because that's how much I love them like
i would literally save up money to buy
another one of these because they're
just look at them and they go with
everything like when I go out if I go to
a meeting I'm going to somebody's house
then everyone just always compliments me
on them and I go into every single shoe
store and they're like damn girl and I'm
like you know mm-hmm what is this
supposed to be that's me trying to be
classy which is not whatever okay the
last thing I want to talk about is my
subscription box service because if you
