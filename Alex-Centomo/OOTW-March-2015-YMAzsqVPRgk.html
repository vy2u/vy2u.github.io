casual with this really comfy sweater
from brandy melville I love the color of
it and it's so soft and I don't know I
love the neckline it's just like the

little bit baggy like boyfriend jeans

wearing is from pink ice I think it
looks perfect with the jacket and then
my jeans are just the regular Jamie
jeans from Topshop they're like the dark
grey version and my shoes are from some
item in the circus collection

together especially with the little hair

glasses
