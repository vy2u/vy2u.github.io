and gone of course like every other
month and I'm so excited for this month
because of something really exciting
that I've been working on for a very
long time and I have talked about for
quite a while now but it's finally
happening Bobby for get into this video
I just want to say that stay tuned till
the end because I do have a little
announcement for you guys a little
special something something for you so
don't skip forward make sure you watch
and you'll see soon so if you guys
didn't know I have come out with a
subscription box service which I
completely do all on my own so like I
create the stuff that goes inside of the
box I design it everything is mine my
own ideas everything like that it's not
like brands that I'm picking out and
just sending like it's all stuff that
I've created my self so I'm so excited
about it because I've been working on it
for a very long time and it finally
shipped out so it is a monthly
subscription service but I'm so excited
because the first one a lot of you guys
have been tweeting me and it came in so
i'm not going to show you the front just
because my address is on it but i'm
gonna show you the stuff inside of it
kind if you guys have been if you guys
have signed up for it already and you
received your package you will know what
the sticker on the front and everything
that's like my logo but guys I'm so
excited this is so crazy I can't believe
this is like real so the first thing
that you'll see is a list so this is the
October list and since this is the
October subscription box that comes at
the end of the month so it comes to list
of everything that's inside at the
package and then just kind of like a
small description of why I chose this
product why i like it and all that kind
of stuff so the first thing is a
lipstick and this lipstick is chosen by
me the color and everything look at that
guys it's like a deep maroon dark plummy
color it's so beautiful perfect for this
time of year perfect for like this type
of colors to wear the formulation is
amazing and it's just such a deep color
oh it's so nice it's like not completely
matte but it's not shimmery it's just
like a very nice like smooth color and I
like the sound when it quick
so good I'm so weird so the next thing
you'll be getting is a black scrunchie
and this is like a velvet scrunchie it's
not super thick it's a bit thin if you
guys don't know i don't really like
using hair elastics i like using like
ribbon elastics or scrunchies and i
thought that this would be perfect
because i didn't even say so the theme
of this box was halloween that was my
theme so everything is like very
halloween based because it arrived like
at Halloween time so this black screen
tree which is perfect it's black and
velvet and it's so soft and comfy really
stretchy and super good to tie your hair
would that holds in place and it doesn't
create any creases which what is what I
love then the next thing we'll get is a
bracelet you just get one bracelet but
these are the three options that I have
so this is the packaging it just says
alex and tomo on it like that and there
is this one which is just like a dark
brown maroon color which is so nice it's
just a beaded bracelet super simple if
you guys don't know like these bracelets
are super popular and trendy right now
so i just really wanted something that
look like that and was more like fall
color and then the other thing that you
will be getting is a nail polish look at
it has my name on it how cool is that so
i chose this color because um if you
guys do i'm wearing on my nails today
it's just like the best fall color ever
i love it oh just like a deep maroon
perfect fall nail polish love it and
then the last thing that comes in a box
oh my gosh this thing is the best ever
it's my own bath bomb ah you guys don't
know how happy I am with this if you
don't know I am obsessed with taking
baths and I love fat bomb so I created
my own and this is the pumpkin spice
latte bath bomb because it's pumpkin
spice latte time of the year so that is
why I came out with this it smells
literally like a pumpkin spice latte
actually I kinda want to eat it
good so on to my favorites of the month
I don't have too much stuff just because
I was traveling a lot so I I was kind of
always having the same thing with me so
the first thing I'm going to talk about
is this sweater of course Alex in a
sweater what else is new so this is an
oversized just oh yeah this is an
oversized knit sweater that i got from
Urban Outfitters there's a hood on it
it's just a light gray color and it goes
pretty deep V so I like to wear it with
lace bra let's I kind of go around your
neck because they show really well and I
get so many compliments when I wear this
sweater so I just been loving this and
wearing it all the time it's super baggy
and soft and comfortable and I like
wearing it around the house especially
but when I wear it out I'll word out
with something very basic and I don't
know just I love the look a bit and you
can really accessorize it with like dark
jeans a dark lip dark nail polish
jewelry um like a bra that's this color
would look so nice against this cuz like
look at these colors together they're so
pretty so I've really been liking that
what I have not been liking is this one
strand that just keeps falling ah so the
next thing I have been absolutely
obsessed with are these jeans Cape for
one the color of these jeans are just so
perfect for fall these are just simple
skinny straight leg jeans they're
high-waisted um very simple like
literally no rips barely any color
change they're all simple but there by
paige denim and if you guys are not
familiar with paige denim i would
definitely suggest investing in a pair
of jeans from there I'm the type of
person that I will spend more money on
simple basic white t-shirts and jeans
because they will last for a very long
time and they never really go out of
style like I probably wouldn't splurge
on like bell bottom jeans because those
are kind of trendy where is just like
simple classic jeans like that are semi
high-waisted like this are probably
never gonna really go out of style and
even if they do like a bit of
high-waisted jeans you can just wear
them underneath loose t-shirt it's like
it's not a big deal but I just love
feeling of paige denim oh my gosh it
feels like leggings and every time I
wear them unlike these aren't jeans
these are not jeans they're so
comfortable there so form-fitting they
like make your butt goeth if that makes
any sense I did splurge on this like big
did not send me these jeans I bought
them with my own money everything I'm
showing in this I bought with my own
money this is not a sponsored video at
all just letting you guys know okay so
the next thing that I got recently that
I've been wearing a lot and like all the
time every time I where people would
make fun of me but I love it and the
soul in fashion right now is this beret
so this is just like a cotton offices
material and one material this is comme
SI comme stuff and I feel like a little
french girl that's gonna go painting but
I love it so much I got this from
shopbop i believe the brand is i don't
know what the Brenda's hat attack
whatever that is but yea or no it's like
a fleece material okay i really don't
know but it's a beret and I think it's
super cute and just kind of spices up
any outfit you're wearing like a sweater
and then you just have your little beret
and it's just so cute and I just really
like that style I see it sometimes I'm
like oh every time I see it in the
picture on tumblr or something I just
really wanted it so I got it then the
next thing that I got in the month of
October and have been wearing all the
freaking time are these booties these
are by acne studios they were actually a
gift so I did not buy these but they did
not send them to me they were a gift
from somebody and they're just so nice
my favorite little booties ever they're
so fall appropriate I do recommend
wearing like very thin layered socks
underneath because you will get blisters
I've learnt the hard way but they're so
nice i like them so much and just
styling those like even those booties
with this shirt and the jeans i just
showed you would be so cute as an outfit
then the next two things i want to show
you are both from the same company and
they're just like skincare kind of
things so i went to keels the other day
because they recently opened a store
near where i live and i went in being
like listen my face has just been
breaking out like crazy because of my
travels and I just really want to help
clear it up and not wearing much makeup
but I just want something that's gonna
really help with my
dehydrated skin because I will break out
because I have dry skin I know a lot of
people don't like it doesn't make sense
but you break out from oily skin or dry
skin she gave me these two products will
she show me a bunch but I didn't want to
spend four hundred dollars that kills so
I got two things that I thought I needed
the most so the first one is a cleanser
and this cleanser is called the ultra
facial cleanser and it's for all skin
types it just really helps clean the
skin it fights like acting like crazy
does not burn lose your skin feeling
super nice it doesn't feel tight
afterwards which I don't like with face
cleansers I don't like that tightness
feeling and it's also anti-aging so I
know that I'm kind of young but I like
to prevent and not just like repair I'm
a big believer in preventing wrinkles
than just repairing them so the next
thing I got was this I actually went to
kills because i was watching carries
video a Miss fashion ADA on youtube if
you guys don't know her she I'll have
her channel link down below but she was
actually doing like a makeup routine and
she used this serum on her face and I
texted her right away and I was like
that thing looks amazing does it break
you out blah blah after a million
questions and she was like no girl it's
amazing so I went and they actually
suggested this one for me which is the
overnight serum so this is called the
midnight recovery concentrate so it's
just a serum or like nuts I don't know
is this year it's not a serum so then
oil that you put all of your face but it
does not break you out it just makes
your skin look amazing when you wake up
in the morning it feels so hydrated it's
glowing it it's like the best thing ever
so what I do is I wash my face at night
I apply my toner and then my serum and
then I will apply this on top and it's
just amazing i've been loving it so I
use it every single night so that is all
for my monthly favorites if you are
interested in checking out my
subscription box service I feel like I
cannot say that word subscription box
service tongue twister say that five
times fast no I'm not even going to try
I will have a link listed down below
again its monthly and there are themes
every month so next month I don't really
want to give anything away but i'll give
you a little hint so there will be some
chokers you know like my favorite
chokers i like to wear some of those so
maybe some fuzzy
I don't know like little things here and
there and I get to really design
everything myself and I'm like one
hundred percent in charge of everything
so everything you get is me and my
products I'm so so excited about it so
check out the link down below as well as
I'll have everything else posted on to
the special surprise I am giving away a
bunch of crap not from urban outfitters
this is just a bag because I want to
urban Urban Outfitters but there's a
bunch of stuff in here so I'm gonna go
through it quickly and then give up the
rules because this video is gonna be so
long and I feel so bad so first thing
you will be winning is this crop sweater
from brandy it says California on it and
I absolutely love the sweater i have one
that says new york and i also have one
from calvin klein that's like literally
identical to this perfect for this time
of year I love brandy so that's the
first thing you'll be 18 next is another
crop sweater from brandy but this one is
a bit different because for one it's
like extra crop it's super crop sleeves
are very very long and it's not thick
fleece material so I just really have an
obsession with gray if you guys can't
tell from my other sweater and like
literally my whole closet is gray
sweaters then there is this OOP simple
oppa tag t-shirt from sabo skirt which
is like really bagging loose you can
wear it over the shoulder it's like
three-quarter length sleeves but very
baggy and then in the back it kind of
goes up in a bit really can't tell I
don't think but it's so flattering and
so cute so I no sabo skirt is like crazy
expensive to shop on and I love their
stuff and you guys always say like you
love their stuff it's just crazy with
shipping and everything so I'm giving
away something from Scott sabes group
and then another thing from Sabo script
that i'm giving away is this this is
just a cropped like muscle tee from
salva skirts pretty thick material
pretty structured but this kind of top
is amazing layered underneath pieces so
if you wear this with like a really
baggy cardigan or a jean jacket or
leather jacket and then just paired it
with a bunch of necklaces chokers and
all that kind of stuff and then
high-waisted jeans will look so cute so
I really really like this plus the
materials super soft then
thing you will be winning from sabo
skirt is this knitted t-shirt it's
cropped but the cool thing about it is
that it goes super long in the back and
this is like a big trend right now I saw
like kendall Jenner wearing something
like this Gigi Hadid like so many people
are wearing this trend right now so I'm
all for it I think it's amazing plus
it's in it so it's so cute layered on
top of a skirt you can even tuck it in
or just jeans in general love it so it's
just simple and gray then from brandy
again oh if you're right ahead to the
brandy item is this dark gray sweater
it's simple it's not too cropped like it
goes down right to wear the jeans are
and it's like long sleeves knit material
super soft and super comfortable then
the last two items that you were winning
oh my gosh I'm embarrassed everything is
grey I don't realize when I go shopping
how much grab I like i will show you God
actually if you watch my blogging
channel you will see how gray my
clothing is because I literally the only
except for this shirt is not bright but
this is just a knitted cardigan it's
like the mizelle but it's a dark gray
color so these are pretty new i believe
and they're just super cute love
layering these types of things and then
the last thing will be winning is from
El space if you guys don't know out
space I worked with them in the summer
and I love their stuff but their fall
line is crazy as well it's so beautiful
so I'm giving you guys this romper it's
black and it cinches at the waist so
it's really flattering so yeah it's
romper and then it goes really low in
the front but you can as you can see
here there's little snap so you could
actually close it and the sleeves are so
beautiful look at this their bell
sleeves with lace detail on the side
it's so pretty so what I'm gonna do is
whoever wins this I'm literally gonna
spray this with my perfume and you guys
are gonna like smell like me is that
weird I don't know I just every time I
talk about my perfume I get so many
questions asking what it smells like if
you guys don't have a Joe Malone around
you you're always so curious so whoever
wins it you guys can figure out what I
smell like because I'm gonna we're gonna
layer it and then if you hate the smell
