channel I am joined today with my fiance
this is Dan if you guys don't know
what's up we actually have a child
together so you guys aren't subscribed
to that definitely make sure to go
subscribe but if you do know about it
then you guys know all about all about
us um also on saying someone's blowing
their leaves so I apologize if you hear
that no I don't think you'll be able to
hear it but just in case might be like a
very subtle yeah but I asked you guys on
Instagram a few days ago to leave me
questions all about our wedding because
I feel like we announced our engagement
and then kind of didn't talk about it
since then and that was in October so
we're definitely overdue but I figured
that we would just go kind of through
the questions and after whatever you
guys want to know about it because yes
we are still planning our wedding it's
just kind of been put on the back burner
a little bit haven't gone for summer
we've been traveling way too much to
have time to plan like actual details
yeah well I mean I guess this particular
but we have kind of a general sense
I'm stuff that we want to do so yeah
actually it screenshot of the question
did you didn't take anything
I wanted you to take time okay first
question comes from Amina farad's world
and she asked are you going to vlog on
the day of your wedding and in the
wedding itself and there's also what
style of dresses is a no-no to you and
you exclude it from the options I I
don't really want us to vlog during that
day because I feel like that's a very
personal day we do have plans for
videographer to film the thing and kind
of like compiled I into really beautiful
video but vlogging itself I just
personally don't want to I mean that's
also up to Dan and ultimately control
his day but I do really want to like
experience it and not have to like
without a camera like I want to be a
real life thing not like a show
make sense I might vlog like up until
the last minute like before I can't
before the ceremony I definitely won't
vlog the ceremony that's for sure and
maybe after during the reception I don't
know probably not though during the day
the thing is we have a lot of friends
that are youtubers and they'll probably
vlog it yeah we'll be able to see it
through their point of view and if they
don't like I might like without the
camera to kind of record my thoughts
like right before I get married I feel
like that's kind of interesting like
years down the line to look back to see
what I was thinking on the day of my
wedding like before yes that's what I
was saying is that I don't think I would
post that I think do it a few more
curves maybe I was thinking like filming
in the morning and then like once I'm
finally getting ready like stopping and
they may be available we're partying
after but I don't know we'll see that
might just be not like I'm just going to
be bridezilla so like I don't know if
I'm going to want to film them be like
super strict in line what about the
second question what style of dresses is
a no-no to you and you exclude it from
the options I don't have any style of
dress that's a no-no because I feel like
that kind of doesn't mean to the dresses
no um the kind of dress that I want
actually this is probably to be like a
reoccurring question on the picture that
I posted but um this is a style dress
that I've wanted for like years I've
never changed my mind because I just
think it's like Sony very basic and
simple and nothing like over-the-top
like I never wanted to have like a
Cinderella dress or anything crazy but I
think a lot of people don't know this if
you don't follow our vlogs or anything
then you actually won't know this but
we're actually well not we my friend is
actually making my dress so I'm not like
getting a you know brand to send me
anything I'm not working with a designer
like my friend is actually making my
dress she went to fashion school and
she's made dresses in the past
and she's really good so it's her first
wedding josh is going to make it
honestly like I and isn't she using
pieces of your mom's dress yeah I just
honestly wanted it to be kind of like
simple always and then she's also
incorporating pieces of my mom's wedding
dress into it maybe it's not for sure
thing because the lace that we got
doesn't match my mom's perfectly but
we'll see about it but my mom's overtime
is kind of gone yellow I think a little
bit it's really not noticeable compared
to like the new lace I just got which
and you guys are curious I said or if
you guys are curious I actually filmed
that day when we went like wedding-dress
shopping and Kay went to buy my fabric
so I'll have the link so that listed
down below if you guys want to see that
but it's all basically we explain
everything in that video of kind of what
I want to do with my dress and stuff and
yeah it's just going to be more
meaningful because it's my friend who
made it and then also having pieces of
my mom's dress in there is going to be
beautiful
next question comes from Laura de
Brouwer the brewer and she says who will
be your maid of honor my maid of honor I
have two so I just I guess a maid of
honor and you could say your best man so
my maid of honor - it's my sister and my
best friend Catherine but I couldn't
decide cuz I always knew I want my
sister to be my maid of honor but at the
same time I was like maid of honor
always kind of organizes the events and
like deal with you in your stress and
talk all that stuff like everything and
I love my sister Magette but she was
horrible that kind of stuff like
organization and planning things like
it's not her cup of tea it's not her
expertise also we're really bad at
handling each other when we're stressed
like she's the kind of person if I was
getting stressed she's like okay fine
bye I'm not doing this anymore like
that's something that she would do or
Catherine who was my best friend and
I've known him for years would be like
okay this is what we're doing we're
doing this now and don't stress like
she'd be very on top of it so I thought
the two of them combined would be
perfect plus it's so hard to decide
because Catherine's also basically like
my sister like we've been through so
much together I'm talking about
Catherine gridlocks by the way so if you
said to friends in caps
and get very confusing but Catherine
I've known her for like the longest side
of all my friends right now
so there are my both native honors and
my best man is my brother Tim who
appears on our vlog channel often yeah
of course
next question comes from ECU still and
she says where do you want to have your
honeymoon
um no idea like at home we travel a lot
so there's no place that like I mean I
guess if we get close to the date and
there's somewhere we have a vignette
that we've been wanting to go maybe we
do that but who knows
yeah we've always talked about maybe I
know at last bury something yeah like we
fun okay next question comes from
Valentina underscore CAG nas it in the
keg nas oh I don't know to pronounce I'm
sorry I'm just curious to know if you're
going to follow some European traditions
especially Italian ones considering your
family's origins no because we are not
from Europe we're from Canada so and
we're just doing sort of like like a our
unique point of our own which wanted to
be our own we don't want to follow like
any old customs or traditions we just
wanted to be fun I don't know like what
we're doing is a custom I think it's
just based off of what we like it's not
like specific towards anything we're
just kind of keeping it really casual
and chill we wanted to have a small
wedding but kind of impossible so a
really big family but at least into the
next question
really yeah Oh in the question comes
from Emily girls gr SF and yes do you
want a big wedding with many people no
oh my god where to go I killed it
no why would you kill it Leslie did tell
I'm a very very big family so small
wedding is kind of not an option with
Goods always that we have a lot of
mutual friends
mhm so a lot of our friends it's like
not my friends her friends it's like
both of our yeah so that's really cool
and we don't have like a crazy amount of
friends you know we have it pretty
core group of friends that are super
close with and then there's like my
family wish it's going to be hard
because I have a lot of people that
meant a lot to me kind of throughout my
life but then I haven't seen them in
like ten years and like my parents on
them there but it's like I don't know
them so it's that kind of hard pain
where it's like you want them because
it's like people that I've never met
actually so it's weird to have someone
at your wedding that you don't even know
like that you never met them and they're
going to come to your wedding it's like
kind of like I don't want people at how
bad cause it's like they're custom
whatever which is fine we're like
judging that it's just for us kind of
like people showed up and we're like who
are you like I wouldn't want to be false
oh I wouldn't want to be introduced to
someone on my wedding night you know I'd
like it to be with the people that I
know and I love them like hot line yeah
someone's plus-one that I've never met
but it's like it was an old family I'm
second cousin twice removed uncle like
from a different country that I don't
know like I don't know I've never met
them so it's like kind of like a
stranger yeah
okay next question comes from Madi
underscore laws and she asked what makes
you the most nervous about getting
married uh for me I don't know not
really anything
I'm scared since the divorce rates are
so high not that I think we're all ever
get a divorce but I'm just but it's not
like divorce is not something that you
like when you get married it's like you
roll a dice and it's going to happen or
not right just because the statistics
are high divorce is up to the people
right yeah we choose whether to get
divorced or not so just because like a
lot of other people do we can just make
that choice to not get divorce right
right but to me marriage is a commitment
and like you commit to someone to get
married to them and that means if there
are hard times you don't like I'm sorry
for lying yeah like you go through it no
matter what you know like you're making
that commitment for life and if you if
you think that like you can't commit to
life by getting a tattoo like that's for
life
I don't know I think that you should
just make that commitment also I feel
like it it helps that we're older not
that I'm putting anything on people that
I married when they're young but because
we are older like maybe we're still
young compared to most people but we're
not in our early 20s so I feel like a
lot of our growth happens yeah we've
been together a long time we go together
we work together like we do all these
things that I would think probably the
only thing that we haven't done together
is had kids oh my god Bridge is going to
be definitely the sex I think that's why
we need to get a dog a good test well
for one because I want a dog but also
it's a really good test because we were
raised very differently and I think
that's something that a lot of people
have actually asked about previously I
mean not differently in a sense of like
what correct country like we were raised
in the same suburb yeah
just like family values and I guess like
ways of like values if you got the same
yeah
but just like like the ways we were
disciplined or like certain things that
we did or like stuff that we did growing
up was different for both of us so yeah
so we're just thinking like okay how are
we going to be as parents you know when
there's like real decisions to be made
about your child's future and you're
just like uh yeah so that I can't agree
like what you do that's like the last
test we really have I think because
everything else we've already done
together oh and one other thing that I
probably often be asked actually it was
asking you to valence I'm not taking his
last name because it's actually illegal
here I don't really go like that don't
you
in Quebec you don't take your spouse's
last name yeah usually like he literally
cat so you can you - you know you can -
egg now I'm only going to say my name
and he's our government because of how
many divorces their word it was way too
complicated to change people's change it
back hyphenated on - it so they just
said you know what no one can do it
anymore
yeah so my name is never gonna change on
like Instagram or I mean even Channel
even if we lives even if we live
somewhere where it needed to I don't
think you would have to change your
online name you could keep that the same
yeah you could the next question comes
from Madi underscore ley 15 she says are
you guys going to have an outdoor or
indoor wedding outdoor yeah we both want
outdoor something nice and like the
summer I think we we want to get married
during a time that's not too hot but not
too cold
like we're thinking either May or like
end of September kind of thing cuz we're
not we're also not doing a destination
wedding yeah because like here July
August thanks so much
spending hours in a suit or a dress like
oh god there's no way it's way too hot
but like my parents got married May 14th
I think is third anniversary and they
said it was like perfect weather because
I mean maybe not this year cuz it's your
suit
so cold but we are planning for next
year that's kind of like our goal right
now is to have it in like 1a or June
next year and we want an outdoor wedding
the only book I tell us everyone the
only thing I really care about like
hardcore when it comes to my wedding is
like I don't want to wear shoes I just
don't want to wear shoes on my wedding
day I want to go barefoot in the grass
and I know that might seem really gross
and weird to most people but that's just
comfortable what I want so I want to be
able to walk down the aisle and like
cushiony grass so no no fuel note inside
a forest because twigs and branches and
leaves and stuff but you know like you
know like in Twilight
yeah like I'm so pretty you know it's
like so basic but I really love that
just something kind of like fairytale II
and like outdoors lots of flowers lots
of little lanterns and very nice very
rustic I think that's kind of like what
we love is like the rustic II I know
there's places around where we live that
there's like sugar shocks you can get
married at work what's they have
abandoned barns windmill things yes good
and so then the only issue would be
people that come out of town we need a
place for them to stay so there's a few
places we've talked about that half of
hotels and stuff so we're really looking
into it nothing is set in stone right
now but that's kind of the vibe we're
going for is like outdoorsy kind of
fairy ish yeah dick
lots of wood and whites and flowers and
I bought flowers in my hair
that's nursing music I don't care about
food I don't care about I mean we'll
probably I'm vegetarian options a lot of
vegetarian friends
and um I don't know
and I went to shopping with my like
groomsmen and we did like measurements
and stuff so as long as none of us
change body shapes drastically in the
next year and a half
we're fine we just have to decide on a
color and like a material so and then we
just get the made and then all material
- yeah cuz you can do like like slightly
pinstripe you can do more mad at oh you
can do a checker and you can do a little
shinier so like depends what you like
they're thinking of having like a bluish
color yeah like I was like a really dark
blue not like a bright royal blue that's
too flashy but like a really dark with
like a shade of blue in it and then
you're like either bow tie or tie or
whatever thing you have to match the
color of the bridesmaid which is like I
was salmon to you isn't it
no it's like a mob so it's like a dark
kind of purplish pink grey which would
look really nice with the dark yeah and
like a white undershirt but would your
any different than that very good well
we discussed that maybe the difference
for me is having a three-piece so having
like a vest underneath for making or
making the cut of the collar for mine
like a little more flashy and then
having more of like a neutral cut or
them all wearing bow ties me wearing a
tie something like that like that's what
my brother-in-law did with my sister he
had a tie and it's two grooms when how
to bowties so yeah whatever honestly as
long as there's something that makes me
stand out so obviously you know on the
groom otherwise it's like which one is
it
you know no one knows when they're at
our wedding
I smacked with my hat also for those of
you that don't know so his best man is
his brother and then you have three
friends three of my best friends well my
brother-in-law and then two of my best
friends and then I have my sister and my
best friend as my maid of honors and
then I have my Cubs my two cousins and
my other friends um we're actually
thinking of asking patent has to be a
part of our wedding party as well just
because we've really been thinking about
it and you even said not too long ago
you're like pops turning into one of
your really really good friends like
we do everything with them and they just
mean a lot to us so we're thinking this
videos going up after we ask them so
hopefully they say yes I don't think
they wouldn't know they're already
coming to our wedding but to be kind of
part of the whole party I think is a bit
more special okay so second part to
maddio's for late 50s question is are
you guys going to write your own vows
oh yeah I saw the question a few times I
mean I don't think so ah
who else would write it for you I don't
know I thought they're like professional
vowel writing people the only thing is I
wouldn't want to say our vows in front
of everyone like I would rather say in
private Oh see that I did not know yeah
cuz I'm like chambers
you wouldn't want people to like make
fun of what you wrote no I just I feel
like something that personal um I'd
rather say to you in private
and say in front of everyone I don't
really care I don't I didn't even know
everyone does those at weddings yeah
like it was like most people do I think
but I've been to weddings where they
didn't so I was like well they might
have said it in private that could be it
too like my sister and my brother-in-law
they did it in front of everyone up at
the lot altar because it was outdoors
but like up at the whatever you call it
okay I guess it's an altar Oh like the
front of the wedding but I've been to
other weddings like cousins and stuff
that they didn't say those so yeah I
think that's everything for a wedding um
if I missed anything you can leave in
the comments down below and I will for
sure answer it
we're definitely going to be vlogging
like a ton leading up to the wedding so
everything that we do is going to be
documented when we're like organizing
things because we haven't actually
started planning yet like running down
and looking through everything so this
summer is for most yeah I get back to my
traveling and is May and so then like
the rest of the time is like focused on
our wedding and getting battle planned
maybe looking into getting a dog is
essential so that whole thing is going
to be really exciting yeah I hope you
guys enjoyed it
I'm like nervous I feel like I'm gonna
fall I'm not nervous to marry you I'm
nervous for the day of the wedding well
you should answer that because there was
a question I know I just thought of it
now side what about to pee like what do
I go for the whole image dress
I'm sure the fine yeah it was like our
relationship me like what are we doing
