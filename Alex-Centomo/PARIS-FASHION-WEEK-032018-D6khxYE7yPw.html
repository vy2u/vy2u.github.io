from downstairs being like hi like we're
waiting to leave and we were like oh my

thank God we packed the night before
usually back well like I had my
toiletries out because I was gonna like
do my makeup and like wash my face and
brush my teeth so I was throwing all
that stuff away and then I had to put my
jackets on top of that you know I was
like closing my suitcase and I was like
I know this has literally never happened
to me before I'm like stressing it's
okay we were told that we still have
tons of time but like guys now I
understand people say when they miss
their flight because

up like three hours before my alarm and
this time I'm like I haven't gone I wash
my face and brush my teeth I have like
just gum

okay guys so clearly we made our flight
that was really stressful if you guys
didn't really understand what was going
on we basically slept through her alarm
which has never happened to me before in
my entire life so I was like what and I
thought we were gonna miss our flight
