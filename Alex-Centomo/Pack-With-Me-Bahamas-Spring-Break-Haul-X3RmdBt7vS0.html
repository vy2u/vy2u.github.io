channel
I'm sorry for salt the lighting is a
little crazy right now it's really early
in the morning and the Sun is coming out
doing all kinds of weird things and
obviously I just use my window for
lighting purposes I have my blinds
closed because as you can see here it's
just like so bright I thought I would
sit down in some of this video for you
guys because I'm actually leaning to the
Bahamas tomorrow but I will be there by
the time you guys are seeing this and
I've seen a few of these videos around
YouTube but I think they're so
interesting one because I'm nosy too
because I like to see what people pack
so I can get inspiration for my next
travel so this video is kind of me
organizing what I want to pack for the
Bahamas slash like a kind of a haul I
want to film a lookbook when I'm there I
caught on to a video based around spring
break so if you guys have any
suggestions of things you want to see
why I'm in the Bahamas let me know
comment down below I'll definitely try
to do some of those for you my life is
so hectic right now with when it comes
to packing like I just over pack or
under pack you just bring always not the
right amount of clothing that I need so
this trip is actually five days but
because I want to film other videos when
I'm there I want to make sure that you
have enough stuff to kind of just for
filming purposes so I'm going to like it
super through everything and then in the
end pick my favorites and bring that um
yeah so if you're interested in seeing
what I'm packing slash new items stay
tuned
first struggle is shorts shorts are
always so hard for you because I own so
many different types of denim shorts and
I'm always thinking okay well these
shorts go better with this top and these
shorts go better with that top so I
might as well just bring all like 10
pairs of shorts and then it's like I
always just end up wearing the same ones
over and over again so that's like some
real struggles I've narrowed it down to
like a few I think these shorts are
great because they like sit really low
on the hips they're really baggy really
comfortable and they're just a simple
blue so they go with almost everything
and even be cute with just your bikini
top and a kimono over it and it's simple
and those are actually redone again
so I'll have links for everything listed
down below if I can find exact I will
have that if not I'll have like as
similar as I can get these are another
kind of similar shorts these are white
those that go with like different types
of tops but again they're a bit lower
there by here and these are by 1tsp
these are so old and I just realized
there's a huge yellow stain on the back
so that's a no as for high waisted
shorts I have two blue ones that I can't
decide between one of them is in the
wash right now but they're really old
and are like vintage Levi's these are
actually new so these are high waisted
and they're baggy but they're really
cute I think this would be so cute with
a belt and a crop top these are by
princess Polly if you guys don't know
princess Polly is an Australian website
they have really cute clothes basically
I did some damage on princess Polly I
mean I might as well just show you the
stuff I got there first
starting with this hat because it's so
look cute look at this how cute is that
I love these conductor looking hats I
think they're awesome
I only queue of them and just I didn't
want I think it's like really really
cool oh and this shirt is something from
princess Polly and this choker so I'm
just like decked out right now it's
really sad by literally just steamed
everything laughs mine is already run
cold like my life but this is a romper
that I got are keeping a brand new mink
pink but I guess they sell it on the
website I got in a size medium because
when I get the size smalls and ROM
prints they always always ride up and
it's so annoying but then when I get a
mediums are like good lengthwise isn't
they're always a little bit bigger
elsewhere which is fine because you can
always use like tape or something to
kind of keep them in and shorts I don't
mind if your by you but like somewhere
the top part but how pretty is this
color so this is a raw / / playsuit I
don't know the proper word for it but
it's so much a beautiful color I think
it's going to look so nice for the 10
another thing from princess Polly is
this little romper whatever it's off the
shoulder and it's like a white really
beautiful delicate looking material like
this I
love when shorts are like longer in the
middle and they go up on the sides they
make your legs look really long and then
another romper would just reminds me of
Greece so much is this one it's again
off the shoulders it has these like
little arm sleeves look like that and
they're so cute there's like button
details in the front and it's just
slowly this again is a romper so they're
short then I have a few top so there's
this one which again off the shoulders
crop top so cute so simple like this is
right up my alley even this would be
cute for Coachella like I just love this
and this is actually a lot it's pretty
different for me but I kind of want to
give it a try it's off the shoulders but
it has like crazy sleeves as you can see
like look at that crazy bell sleeves
like I took a risk with this it's really
cute I did try it on because I want to
see what it looks like it definitely is
so different it's beautiful but like
it's so different from my style so I
really like need to embrace it when I
try I think it's gonna look great though
and then this is the last puff that I
got again off the shoulder it's like so
simple it's kind of hard to see but I
mean like beige where your arms go
through and it's just this color I think
it's really pretty and again with just
the high waisted shorts I showed you
from before another pair of shorts that
I got from princess Polly are these ones
they're really ripped up denim I'm not
the biggest fan of these ones like the
color of them they looked a lot
different online so I was a little
disappointed when they came in the mail
but they're still really cute I might
give them to like a friend or my sister
but they're like they're still super
cute like don't get me wrong I just for
me personally this shade of blue isn't
my favorite and then last but not least
because I do have a pair of shoes this
is a one-piece bathing suit that I got
from them it's like open in the back and
just this really pretty like teal color
with cream stripes that go down I think
it's really nice and again going to look
so sick with a 10 I'm so excited already
bringing it too much stuff for this trip
like I'm just realizing I'm there for
five days I mean I have an outfit for
like a picture of an output for like if
I want to film my lookbook I
have an outfit in mind for dinner so I
just really need to like organize myself
then I have these shoes so cute how cute
these they're like little slip ons we
have these chunky heels and they're like
a velvety kind of material I don't think
it's real but not delta-t suede then I
have stuff from revolve so you guys know
revolve is like oh is my go-to for when
it comes to like traveling and stuff
they have like the best options and I
know it's like on the pricier side and
people get really frustrated because
they're like ah revolt is so expensive
for me like I really love their clothing
I've been shopping our vol since before
I even started YouTube like before they
were this big thing that they are now
but again it's true outside your price
range I totally get that I mean I was
student before and struggle was real I
will try to find dupes like on a sauce
or forever something that's really
similar all of the exact links down
below if you guys are curious but this
is the first top it's so cute it's like
a bondo a bando I'm French bondo and
just like really short there has these
like sleek parts to go off the shoulders
really cute picture this with
high-waisted denim shorts sandals and a
really cute hat but then this romper
from revolve is like totally up my alley
so it's looks white on camera it's
actually a really pale pink and it's
long-sleeve and super deep v but you can
see the bow in the front at the waist
and then it has these ruffles and the
back has this most beautiful detail it's
so pretty then I think I'm going to
bring this vintage Tommy sweater because
it's yellow and I think it would look so
cute on the beach I think I'm going to
move on to bikinis now because I just
like have way too much clothes and I'm
like kind of stressing myself all right
now I'm also bringing workout gear but
that I don't think I need to show you
I'll show you my toiletries afterwards
as for shoes I'm literally bringing
those shoes that you just saw with like
beach flip-flops and the sandals from
Windsor because they're simple gladiator
sandals when zerah sandal
it was really lightweight so I mean
they're always like my go-to and their
kids will go with everything these
bottoms look so small but don't worry
they're like extremely stretchy they are
cheeky bottom so the back does look like
this but there's still really cute I
love the color they only have this size
available which is a size small I
normally am a size small and bikini
bottoms but these are Frankie bikinis
and I think that they're made smaller
should have gone to medium but they
didn't have but okay
so I got I got two bikinis from for love
and lemons well bikini bottom for one I
like so embarrassed oh this is like it's
so ridiculous it's so ridiculous but
actually it's really nice on okay this
is the front and this is the back like
can you even see that it's literally a
song what the heck but you're supposed
to wear this like really high up when
you're on your hips it's just it looks
really good and especially just if
you're lying out in the Sun it's fine
but I mean it's definitely a huge risk
but I thought if I'm going to wear this
anywhere it's going to be in the Bahamas
on the super small secluded island so
I'm going to try that out then I have
this one piece from 411 lemon this is so
confusing to show as fear because the
color looked really different online but
I think it's really pretty so it's like
a normal top and then it crisscrosses
around the stomach and then it comes
down to these high-waisted bottoms so
the bottoms would look like this and
then they're just kind of cheeky in the
back and from the back it actually just
looks like a bikini so I really like one
pieces that look like that bikini from
the back and then they're kind of like
cool crisscross angle in the front this
will definitely be showing in my
lookbook I'm excited then I have this
one piece this I got four balls and I
think it's by the brand bows and a bow
and arrow no honestly I don't know which
brand this is but I'll have it linked
down below it's so
I love the style it was really pricey
like honestly was really pricey and I'm
sure you can find something super
similar on like forever something but I
did not find anything with this pattern
and I just loved this pattern so much so
it's definitely an investment but I
really really think it's cute but I did
the ridiculous price like you guys are
gonna laugh when you see it for my main
toiletries I have this which is like an
after Sun cream which you put on your
skin after you've been in the Sun or
after you've a spray tan and it has a
little bit of like sparkle to it so it
really makes your attention and glow and
it's also good for like an after Sun if
you do get too much fun it helps cool it
kind of like an aloe gel it looks really
nice so this is by the brand bio term it
was sent to me like last year or sent to
my sister last year and I just stole it
I don't know it was in my bedroom at my
parents and I was like oh I'm going to
try that so I'm bringing this then I
have my sunscreen for my face this is
super fluid UV defense sunscreen SPF 50
plus it's really good for the face I do
have very sensitive skin so this is a
must I also need a big bottle of
sunscreen
we ran out so I need to get therapy
pharmacy I have to remind myself because
sunscreen is like the most important
thing when going to a sunny destination
and then I have this my little travel
sized origins
it's the dermabrasion slick an exfoliant
face wash and this is good because it
really helps my skin to feel like really
smooth I can apply makeup on top of it
really nice and I do find if I'm in the
sea a lot and there's a gloss salt water
my skin I tend to get very dry skin and
bumpy and obviously an exfoliator just
kind of gets rid of all that then I have
this this is like my Holy Grail product
so my face will never tan I mean I don't
try a tan in the Sun but like spray tans
will not stick to it ever I don't know
why it will like these super dark the
first day as soon as I wash my face the
first time it's a white me and my sister
are both like this growing up our faces
just never tend I guess that's a good
thing but it just looks weird when I
have a spray tan and my face is like
pale and
sometimes the makeup doesn't really do
it justice so if I mix my makeup with
this which is like a bronzing shimmer
luminous cream it makes my skin on my
face look so tanned and so pretty and so
natural so I actually did this along
Europe but this is going to be great in
the Bahamas as well and I can like put
it all over the rest of my body it kind
of just gives you instant color it looks
great this is the dark for medium to
dark skin tones from loving tan and it
smells amazing I definitely am over
packing but because I'm going to be so
many multiple videos there I think this
will be good I think I have everything
set if I'm forgetting oh deodorant Oh
see this is why I like I just felt I'm
all over the place when it comes to
travel and like packing I need to
organize my life also if you guys are
curious to get anything from princess
Polly I have a discount code for you
guys so I'll have all the details listed
down below and the promo code will be
right here but it's for 20% off if you
want to check it out so definitely do
that so I am completely packed I have
everything in this side all night
aki-nee's in this big one I decided to
bring my Gucci shirt just to lounge
around and it's really oversized and
comfortable so I figured that would be
perfect and then on this side I do have
some sports bras as well as like some
sleeping shorts all my shoes are packed
underneath behind the underwear and then
as for the plane I'm going to be wearing
these shoes whoo they're just really
comfy with some sweats a sweater duffel
bag and my purse and that is everything

big thumbs up it makes me so happy and I
don't know I just I really miss you guys
