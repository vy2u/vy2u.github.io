channel I am currently in a new position
a new position I currently am sitting in
my messy bedroom right now because I
have some friends over test Pat Julia
and Carrie are staying over for the
weekend
and then I'm actually leaving for
Ireland on Monday with tests Pat and
Daniel and so I figured I'm gonna show
you guys what I'm packing for Europe
because we are there for one full week
we're just doing Ireland and it's quite
cold
so packing jackets sweaters and jeans
and all the kind of stuff I know it can
get really hard and I know a lot of you
guys are curious is like how I were to
pack so I do share things with Daniel
because it's just easier if we pack
together and it also saves a lot of
space a lot of room and obviously if you
guys are packing for just one person it
makes this like 10 times easier but yeah
without further ado let's just get into
the video okay first things first
okay I'm all packed up I'm all good this
is all I need this is how you pack for
vacation right so typically before a
vacation I like to kind of lay out all
of the clothes here that I think would
go good with the weather that I'm
traveling to so I just have a bunch of
sweaters that either I got sent or that
I bought for the course of the month
that I haven't really like worn that
often or at all I think there's some
really great options obviously I'm not
bringing everything and this is my main
trick so I put out everything that I
think I would like to wear and then I go
from there
make a list so I have a list of
everything I want to bring so for
example I wrote sweaters for knits five
because it's the sweaters to me are
different sweaters were like the big
chunky sweaters and knits can be like a
really thin knit turtleneck or something
like that and that's kind of like how I
start off organising my trips so for
this one dan and I are going to be
sharing a really big suitcase so I'll
have only one half of this and then
he'll have the other half and then we're
gonna have our carry-on and it just
makes more sense that way a lot of the
times I'll pack like two extra outfits
in my carry-on in case this gets lost
because I'm always paranoid of that
happening this is plenty of space so if
you can see here
it's pretty deep you could fit a lot in
there and then my toiletry I don't bring
much and I bring everything like
carry-on size so it's pretty simple and
then den has the other side that leaves
us with just one suitcase it's like he
knows I'm leaving I wish I could bring
you with us I'm sorry you're gonna be
taking such good care of by Beverly and
you love her so this is basically what
I'm working with now there's a few
pieces that I haven't put in yet for
example like a big fluffy jacket that
I'm gonna be wearing on the plane but I
wear that every single day so I'm not
gonna pack that in my suitcase that's
gonna be like my plane outfit as well as
like leggings and like a pajama t-shirt
socks underwear and bras I kind of just
throw it at the end at this point but
this is kind of everything I want to
bring black jeans blue jeans two coats I
have a leather jacket and this is a good
quilted bomber and it's pretty easy to
pack because you can just roll it up and
it's really small I have two scarves
over there and then I have two hats
makeup bag toiletry bag with all my like
carry-on travel-sized toiletries things
like dry shampoo shampoo conditioner
face wash body moisturizer face cream
all that stuff then I have a pair of
sunglasses because I mean even though it
is you typically rainy and cloudy and
Ireland you never know if there's Sun
Plus my eyes are sensitive I wear
sunglasses even if it's cloudy and then
I'm bringing my extensions as you guys
know I wear extensions quite often not
on an everyday basis but a lot of the
times if I'm doing a shoot or from
taking pictures or if I just want to
have like really long full hair for the
day which it's always so pretty and
these are the blonde balayage set from
luxy hair they're the seamless
collection so if you can see like
they're just flat against your head
which I really like and you guys know
that I have been working with Wuxi now
forever and I just love them plus if I
want to do any like braids or anything
it's so cute for pictures I just love it
and I'll show you a really good trick of
how I pack my extensions because I get a
lot of questions about that so I figured
I would do that but first I'm gonna show
you guys like where everything's from
because I feel like a lot of you guys
haven't seen some of this stuff yet
because I haven't really showed it in
any videos or anything so we'll start
off with the scarves this one is from
acne and this is just like a
really good quality scarf it's thick
it's warm honestly I love it I love the
color
it's perfect this one is a lot softer it
feels more like like a cloud I guess
this is from Abercrombie no this is from
American Eagle and it's just like a
cream / white color then ask for mine
it's I have this one from Maj RAL I got
this off of revolve it's a really cute
cropped like fuzzy sweater and it has
like little slits on the sides I just
love like this feeling then these all of
the rest are from brandy so I have this
mustard color one I have this turtleneck
light grey one which I used to like to
wear under my thick knits to kind of
layer up I have this one which I think
it reminds me of stranger things I don't
know why it just does and then I have
this one it's and almost looks like a
long-sleeve t-shirt but it's it's you
could got you guys could tell it's like
sweater material so it's super warm and
I like the color it's kind of like a
off-yellow vintage looking color so
these are all the knits I'm bringing
then ask for hats I have this one from
Windsor love this it's like a go to this
is actually Daniels but I'm bringing it
for us to share it's from Brixton and I
got it for him I think for Christmas
last year but we both share it it's it's
like a basic then sweaters I have this
one from brandy it's simple it says
Newport this is more just to lounge
around in if we're just like at the
cottage because we're staying at a
cottage so I it's just really soft and
comfortable more just a casual sweater
then these ones are more like my dressy
sweaters like I would wear these out
with you know nice jeans and booties I
think they're so nice this one is from
Free People and if you guys watch my
October you will recognize this I said
it reminded me of my mom because she had
a sweater this color went like in the
90s and I love it this one is from Zara
actually the next two are from Zara I
love this color I think this would be
really nice with the light jeans and
then this one is more of a thick knitted
material like it literally looks like it
was knitted and it's very itchy this one
so that is why I'm bringing this
long-sleeve gray tee kind of thing cause
it's super lightweight really soft and
it feels really good under this if you
don't see the t-shirt under it and it
just makes it so that's not a chi and I
know I get a question all the time like
why would you buy an itchy sweater but
like I love the look of these sweaters I
just have very sensitive skin
it's just very itchy on me then this one
is from brandy it's a simple turtleneck
long-sleeve kind of knit this is really
old I literally don't know where this is
from like this is the brand then I just
have a plain Gucci tee this again is for
more of like if I was going to a bar and
I want to tuck this into jeans with a
like I don't know denim jacket like that
oh that reminds me I need to pack a belt
good thing I'm like doing this video
then the two jeans that I'm bringing are
this pair from lovers and friends I got
it off with revolve and then I'm
bringing my good old ASOS jeans that I
wear like every single day they're the
farley ones I'll have everything linked
down below so you guys can check it out
for yourselves obviously things like
this I won't be able to because it's so
old and maybe it's some of the brand new
things like this I've had for years but
you can find this at H&amp;amp;M I'll have
things linked similar so if you guys
want to check out stuff that's like
similar vibe then I have this vegan
leather jacket from Free People and it
has a really nice like bow it's not even
furs I don't even know what to call this
but yeah and then this quilted jacket is
also is from revolve and it's by Tula
Rose I believe and then this is from
Henri Bendel I got it in New York this
is or BAE it actually came in a package
when I got like some things sent to me
so I just keep this because it's really
good quality and then of course just key
Austrailia sunglasses which they look
like this they're kind of vintage II and
I got them off with princess Polly I
really like them a lot
now as for the extensions if you use the
code Alex Channel five you guys can
actually get money off your first order
so I'll have all details listed for that
below and of course I love working with
luxy hair guys like they are my favorite
I cannot wait to style these good babies
for you for my Ireland pictures I'm
gonna have so many cool hairstyles so
make sure you follow me on instagram and
follow luxy hair too because they repost
a lot of pictures as well and I love
getting inspiration from their feed for
my own hair but what I like to do is
actually use some kind of a like you
know when you buy shoes sometimes or a
purse and it comes in a little duffel
bag like this really thin kind of cotton
material I like to package my extensions
in something like this but I don't just
like throw them in I actually braid them
so excuse the cuts on my hair
this is from boo he is teething and it
hurts so bad but basically I just do a
regular three stand stranded braid and
the reason why I do this is because it
helps to keep the extensions pretty safe
while traveling in your bag and also it
keeps a really nice shape so you don't
have to worry about like restyling them
and it helps from tangling so now I have
a little burrito of extensions just a
little trick I thought I'd give you guys
I just think it looks so nice having
extensions especially for pictures it's
just so beautiful they're really
lightweight they don't like hurt my
scalp or anything so they're really
convenient for traveling and that's like
a big thing for me especially the
seamless collection and you can
literally just squeeze it in anywhere
kind of just like an underwear or a bra
or something and that's everything I'm
packing I'm probably going to figure out
what shoes I'm going to bring like the
day of and then maybe throw in if I have
room like another net or something so
everything fits perfectly which is what
I thought what I ended up doing and this
is what I was explaining earlier is
because I have a half a suitcase and I'm
not rolling anything because it fits
really easy and then I have my carry-on
and this I'm bringing just like one of
each so I have one knit one pair of
jeans my hat a scarf pair of sunglasses
and on this side I have well actually
have two sweaters and another net this
is just in case this luggage does not
come on time I want to be able to have
something with me and you guys know I
always typically pack with carry-on only
so packing with luggages I'm checking
always stresses me out this just ensures
that like everything gets there and I
mean if it doesn't then I have options
to wear and I can always read where
sweaters you know what I mean so it's
not that big of a deal and it fits quite
easily it's really small this suitcase
and it's gonna be really light and also
there is enough room for me to bring a
pair of booties which I actually forgot
to mention which ones I'm gonna bring
because I'm not sure which ones yet I
can always like look how this is just
the quilted thing like I can squish this
down so much or I could put the boots
underneath and put this on top like
there's still a lot of room I hope you
guys enjoyed it
