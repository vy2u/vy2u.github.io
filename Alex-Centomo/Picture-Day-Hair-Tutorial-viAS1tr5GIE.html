this video by thanking you all so much
for all the love and support you've been
giving me on my vlogging channel so I
will link that down below and also thank
you so much for letting me know how much
you've been liking my hair tutorials
because I love doing hair so it makes me
really happy that you guys like to see
them so today I figured I would show you
something that would be really quick and
easy for like a back-to-school hairstyle
video you can either be for picture day
it can be for like any kind of event you
guys have or even just like an everyday
curl it's really nice it does not take
long super quick and easy doesn't damage
your hair I just I love this if you've
seen my loose curls hair tutorial which
I use with a straightener I found
something that does like the exact same
thing but with a curling wand and it
just looks beautiful
it also takes like half the amount of
time so if you're interested then just
keep on watching also yes that is stitch
back there he is my best friend I've had
him since I was 11 and I just really
like him so I decide to put him back in
my videos because he used to be in every
single one my videos today I am going to
be using my new me set this is the
lustrum one set it's like a travel set
it comes with the wand and then a bunch
of different barrels like this this is
so convenient for when you're traveling
I'm gonna start traveling a lot so I
thought this would be perfect because as
you can see here you have like your
curling wand in this thing like this and
then and all the other sections are
different kinds of wands that you can
just pop into this one and you're good
to go
so you can create a bunch of different
curls with these looks the bigger one
obviously makes looser waves and then
the smaller ones make tighter curls but
you can always play around with that and
I'm just super excited because this set
is awesome
you don't have to worry about bringing
multiple curling wands or straighteners
or whatever there's even a section here
that you can add your straightener in
the middle so everything is just compact
and it doesn't get tangled and
everything and it just keeps it all safe
and secure inside your suitcase which is
really awesome if you ask me this set
also comes with a protective glove as
you guys saw in my last tutorial when I
use a new me product I put it on the
and that is because I don't use it that
often because I've been working with the
wands a lot I'm pretty gentle but for
anyone that's just like starting out or
you do have a habit of burning yourself
I would really recommend you using this
but I also find that like because a lot
on the barrels I don't want to burn the
surface so I'll actually just put my
wand on top of this one it's hot on any
surface so that it just protects the
surface from burning or whatever because
I've definitely done that before so I'll
just lay this out of my counter and then
put the wand on top while it's resting
and yeah so for the looks that I'm going
for today are very similar to my loose
curls hair tutorial with the
straightener so I'm gonna go for the
biggest barrel just because I find that
that gives you the closest wave to the
straightener because I do want them a
bit bigger but also for my front strands
like around my face and everything I'm
gonna be using the medium one because
since I do have longer hair I find this
one works best for the underneath
sections but then I do have layers and
stuff so the medium one works really
good for that so I like to mix and match
which is perfect for this look so then I
just pop it in here all you have to do
is push it in and twist to lock turn it
on and wait for it to heat up it
seriously takes like five seconds on
even like I could already feel the heat
radiating off of this it's pretty sweet
it takes like five seconds to heat up so
while I wand is heating up I actually
like to prime my hair before I put any
heat on it you guys know I love to
protect my hair and I actually find that
this product has worked wonders to my
hair I've been testing this out like
every single time I put any heat product
in my hair and you guys know I don't
like to put heat on my hair that often
just because I am trying to get my hair
super healthy I went all summer without
using heat so every time I'm going to
put any kind of heat on my hair I'm very
cautious towards it but I just find that
this product is awesome it's the new me
a white truffle hair primer it smells
like the ocean it smells like super
beachy and really fresh it smells so
good
I find this leaves your hair looking
super shiny it really protects your ends
so that they don't get damaged when
you're using any kind of heat tool which
is awesome so what you do with this
product is you just squirt a little pump
inside your hand
and then I rub it around and I just run
it through start I usually start with my
ends just because those were like the
driest so I'll kind of go like this on
the ends and then I'll work my way up my
hair I'll never put it in my roots just
because I'm nervous because I have a
very oily scalp but you're not I'm not
really putting any heat on my roots so
wherever I'm gonna be applying heat is
where I put it a little goes a long way
as well oh my gosh this smells so good
and what's great about this is that the
scent stays in your hair for a long time
so like I find with my perfume and all
my mixes really well together the next
day I'll wake up and I'll smell my hair
and I'm just like smelling so good for
days I love it
anything that has to do with like the
beach enos and fresh scent is just like
perfect for me if there is a perfume
like that that you guys know that's out
there please let me know because I would
love to try it
I love smelling like the beach if you
know what I mean doesn't smell like
dirty it smells like so good oh my gosh
I wish this isn't perfume cuz I would
totally wear this keeps your hair super
hydrated and it protects it from heat
which is great so when that's all
throughout my hair I will take my
curling wand I can feel that's hot
what's great about the turbulent barrels
is that they don't damage your hair you
know me with damaging my hair I don't
want to damage my hair so I figured that
this wand is probably the best thing to
use for more of an everyday basis even
though you don't have to use this one
every day because your curls will stick
for days I'm not even kidding you I can
wear this look and you know I wash my
hair every like 4 to 5 days the curls
will last until I wash my hair the next
time it's awesome I just love it so I
just go away from my face leaving a bit
of the ends out I don't like to curl the
ends completely I don't leave this too
long and then I let it fall and I kind
of run my fingers through it right away
and that's it and you can change
directions if you like I like to keep
the front pieces going away from my face
and then the other ones are kind of
changed
directions and make sure the hair is
pretty flat around the barrel just for
that look that I'm going for but I just
find that this item is just so
convenient to use I just love this set
because it has everything so now that
these front sections are done I like to
keep at the front top with a big barrel
the bottom pieces of the big barrel and
then the some kind of side slash back of
the top I'll use a smaller barrel just
to kind of give it some different
dimension and everything I'm going to go
ahead and do the bottom portion of my
hair right now so I'm just sectioning my
hair into two different layers I'm just
gonna take a clip and pin it back so it
stays out of my way this is the top half
and then I just grab the bottom half
like so go in my hand and go so those
are the bottom curls like this if you
guys are interested in this set I will
have some coupon codes for you down
below the first one is $99 for the
lustrum set and all the other sets if

an affordable price so if you are

just enter the code I will have all the
links and stuff listed down below and
also if you want 60% off the entire site

Canada which is pretty awesome if you

Alexandra 60 and again I will have
everything listed down below for you
guys let me know if you do purchase them
because last time a lot of you were
tweeting me telling me that you did and
that you tried out the look and you
loved it which is so awesome I love
seeing you guys recreate my looks so it
makes me really happy
I don't think I'm ever gonna go back to
like straightening my hair
or curling my hair the straightener
after using this just because I find
what the straighteners they really do
damage your hair like I feel like I have
to put in a lot of he protected spray
and stuff and then still at the ends
feel really like fuzzy I don't know if
you guys know what I mean because this
is turbulent I just find that the barrel
itself doesn't damage your hair so your
hair actually ends up looking healthier
and shinier anything that's gonna help
in that is definitely something that I
want
so once the bottom is all curled I will
just unclip the top section and I will
bring that forward before I switch
barrels I just want to do the few pieces
around the front of my face because I
like the bigger wand for that I just
like these curls to be very loose the
bigger the barrel the looser the curls
will be I let this cool down for a
little bit before I switch it up so once
that is cooled down and put away I will
just take the medium-sized one and put
it in the same barrel stick it in turn
it on wait for it to heat up which will
not take long and then I'll do the rest
of my hair so I like the back sections
and stuff like that the back and side
top sections and I just find that this
gives dimension to your hair so it's not
all uniform curls and I just find that
really like looks best looks most
natural see how this is kind of curly
and frizzy I just go over it
a couple times just to get it away from
my face and then I curl
also I know I've been doing a lot of
hair tutorials lately but you guys
really request them majority of you
really want to see me do them so I love
using curling wines I rarely actually I
haven't straightened my hair in like
years I don't remember last time you
straighten my hair it doesn't suit me I
find I'm not the biggest fan of straight
hair plus it just really damages my hair
and at this point I'm just trying to
keep my hair as healthy as possible so
so sorry for all of you guys don't want
me to strain my hair but like it's not
happening right now maybe in the future
when my hair isn't as like damaged so
you got the smaller curls on top and
then the bigger curls on the bottom and
it just looks awesome on to the next
section also if you guys want more
volume you can add in some extensions I
sometimes do like today I added in some
a few extensions here and there just to
give my hair some more volume and
structure because I do have very fine
hair so for something like picture day
where majority of the time you're gonna
see from here up you're not going to be
seeing much I have very brittle ends so
I want it to look more full near the
ends so I just add in a few extensions
to make it look like I have fuller hair
because not everyone is blessed with cat
belle hair hi Katherine she has like
such thick thick hair it's crazy so then
this is the completed look before adding
any products I just finger comb through
it to give it more volume and texture
and what I like about this using the
smaller barrel on the top section of my
hair just gives it that extra volume and
extra texture to it so it's not all
uniform and then as you go down the
curls get bigger and because of the
extensions it just looks more full
honestly I don't know where I got these
extensions so don't ask
they're super super old for when I used
to have like my whole head was blonde
for a picture day I find for me
personally it's all up to personal
preference but I like to have my hair
always on one side you guys know that in
a lot of my videos I have my hair to one
side so you can either tuck your hair
behind your ear like this and pin it
back so it's like this which I really
like and then when you're on the side
you can kind of just smile and like a
nice contoured cheekbone with a little
bit of blush would look really nice
because you're showing the side of your
face I usually like to keep a little bit
of winged liner and make sure your
eyebrows aren't on point because picture
day you know a little bit of lipstick
and then this side looks very
professional nice or if you wanted
something more on this side but
personally I like to show more of the
face so I would tend to go to more
towards the side then when it comes down
to the top it depends on your school I
know some schools have different
preferences if you guys have a uniform
then obviously that's what you'd have to
wear but I know at my school we could
wear whatever top as long as there
wasn't like some crazy graphic on it so
I would wear something like this that's
kind of like just plain everything keeps
the focus away from your shirt and more
on your face jewelry I would wear
chokers because I just like that
depending on your school again if they
allow you more chokers but yeah this
look is really nice so you could either
leave it like this or you could add in
some of course texturizing spray or sea
salt spray which is what I'm gonna do
because that's my favorite thing and you
can tell because of the heat primer that
I use before it just keeps my ends
super healthy looking and not brittle it
looks like I just got a fresh cut which
I haven't trimmed my hair in like months
I'm due for a trim so it's just I really
like it plus oh it smells so good I wish
you guys could just smell this like you
smell it so then obviously you're gonna
want to use some hair spray because
you're gonna be wearing this look all
day at my school we usually do our
pictures in the morning right away but I
know that like at my cousin's school
they'll do it later on in the day and
stuff like that so you want to make sure
that your hair holds all day Plus with
the wind and everything
so I just go in with some hairspray this
is they what is this the Fructis styling
spray and I like this because it doesn't
make your hair crunchy but it gives you
that hold so I like to separate the
pieces before I spray them okay guys
this is seriously my new favorite way to
curl my hair look how nice this looks
I'm actually so obsessed with it oh my
gosh and the great thing is that you
wake up the next like three days and the
curls will still be there obviously if
you guys have the oily scalp issue which
are you you can add in some dry shampoo
then I'm gonna go in with a little bit
of my texturizing cream you guys all
know I love this stuff rub it between
the palms of my hands and then just
scrunch it in to add in some texture
I usually to focus it in the front
because that's what you're gonna be
seeing most right back section whatever
everyone sees the front sections look
how shiny my hair looks and then a
little bit of this give it that be genus
okay I'm officially obsessed with this
it's so nice
Wow so again if you're interested in the
coupon codes I will have them listed
down below for you guys with links so
you guys can find what you're looking
for and if you have any other
suggestions maybe if you want to see a
makeup tutorial it's pretty simple I
mean honestly all I did was put some
bronzer some blush lipstick and winged
eyeliner plus a little bit of eye shadow
like it's really not anything that crazy
and just let me know in the comments
below because I will be in Vancouver
