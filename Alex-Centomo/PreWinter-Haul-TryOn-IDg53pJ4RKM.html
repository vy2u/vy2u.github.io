every single day during December up
until Christmas
hauls are my favorite videos to film I
love them so much I'm currently chilling
sitting on my floor
Black Friday was this past Friday cyber
monday is tomorrow this is the weekend
of shopping especially for me so I did
do some Black Friday shopping so this is
kind of like a Black Friday haul but
then I also did some shopping online and
then there's also sales for things for
Cyber Monday so I'll definitely make
sure to include kind of like all the
sales that are going down or you can
check out the websites and see for
yourself if you want to purchase any of
these things here is also not
cooperating with me today so I just put
it in this ponytail because I'm just not
dealing but before I get into the whole
I just wanted to quickly say thank you
guys so much for all of your comments
and questions about my jewelry lately I
get questions on a daily about where my
jewelry's from my necklaces my earrings
all that kind of stuff and I wanted to
announce that I have come out with a
smug jewellery line
I'm so excited it is in collaboration
with stillness they reached out to me
wanting to collaborate and it's
something that has been a passion of
mine for so long and we have worked on
it for months going back and forth with
designs and what I wanted exactly I have
very like focused image of what I wanted
I wanted ET jewelry I designed
everything myself and with the help of
stillness and then being able to
actually make it which is the best thing
ever
yeah I'm really grateful and I'm really
I did about it I hope you guys are too
the necklaces are real gold everything
is real so you can wear in the shower
that was my main thing is I want to be
able to wear this jewelry all the time
that's my favorite thing to do I don't
like to take off jewelry one because I'm
lazy and two because I just always love
the look of jewelry on me my rings I
never take off necklaces earrings I just
always keep it on when I shower when I
work out when I do anything I don't want
to have to like worry about taking the
stuff off so that was kind of like my
main thing and they're all made to order
so they're gonna be made depending on if
you guys want them or not I think it
would be such a special gift to give
somebody so this is one of the pieces
right here it's a crescent moon it's
pretty light the chain is super delicate
and sparkly it looks so nice this one is
just one size it fits exactly like this
on me and it has one clasp in the back
then the other three necklaces have an
adjustable clasp but you can either have
them as a choker or as a longer necklace
and they're so dainty I am obsessed this
first one here is a tiny little jewel
you guys know I had one identical to
this that was in white gold from
Tiffany's and I wore it every single day
and then now to have one in yellow gold
I'm so excited about it because I'm all
about the olih gold right now the next
one is a tiny crescent moon just like
the one I'm wearing but instead of it
being really big it's super small the
third one is a tiny star and I wear
these all the time I'm gonna give you a
quick kind of overview of the brand I
decide to name it lumen calla I have
been a fan of Harry Potter and the quote
that Dumbledore says happiness can be
found in even the darkest of time if one
only remembers to turn on the light and
that quote resonated with me for years
and that is because you guys know I'm a
huge believer in choosing positivity and
always allowing your life to be kind of
like a positive path but you need to let
the negativity in in order to appreciate
the positive parts in life so without
the darkness you wouldn't have the light
it's the yin and yang to the universe I
think it's important for balance
I wanted to name
the brand darkness and light but I
didn't want to name it darkness and
light I wanted to be kind of a different
language so I searched up for so long to
try and find the words in a different
language and nothing really fit and then
I realized I'm a huge huge fan of
fantasy and elvish and so I searched up
light and darkness in elvish and its
loom and Kalla
and I loved the way that sounded so
there you go I am so excited so I have a
link down below for you guys I am so
excited about this like you have no idea
and I would really love to know your
thoughts as well and like I said before
it's all real jewelry it's not fake that
you can buy any kind of like store and
then it tarnishes like this is real and
it'll last and it's beautiful and I am
so excited about it so without further
ado let's get actually into the hall now
because that took quite a while and my
videos are always long whatever so first
place that I went what is forever 21 oh
my gosh it looks like I got a lot of
stuff just because one of the things
looks so big the first thing I got was
this knitted cropped sweater it's really
soft and like kind of squishy it's like
a squishy material and I liked this
color because it was dark I got it in
the size medium this is obviously a very
fall color but I thought this would be
perfect to transition into winter and
wearing this with dark jeans like a dark
denim blue or a dark black jean with
booties I really like that look a lot
and it's a little crop so you can wear
it with something more high-waisted then
a similar kind of cropped sweater this
one is a bit more baggy and this is in a
size medium as well with this really
cute maroon colored knit that so has a
little bit of distress on it this is
definitely cropped so obviously suggest
wearing it with high-waisted jeans I
really like the way this looks and I
really love the way it looks off the
shoulder with like a bra light
underneath or sports bra that you can
kind of see when you move your arms I
think that look is so pretty
then I got this which is size large
it's a white knit with these really cute
stripes it's not really cropped it's
kind of just like a baggy knit but it's
really soft really thin material this
just looks so wintery to me and I think
that's with a denim blue Jean would look
so good together and
Gurs or boats it's snowing where you
guys live leggings and boots and this
then I have this super soft knit oh my
gosh this I don't even know what
material this is it's like the fuzziest
sweater of life this isn't a size large
and it's so amazing I love the color of
it I love the material the most though
like it's a fuzzy sweater but not like
you can't pull out it I think it's
Chanel is that how you say it like that
Chanel it's not only just a pink it's my
favorite pink color like it matches my
pillows over there my lipstick color I
just love it do you guys like a little
snowman by the way he's so cute I am so
excited for vlogmas hey the last thing
in here which took up most of the room
of the bag is this like fuzzy fleece
hoodie guys I want to just wrap this
around my entire body for the rest of my
life and just be like this it's so soft
I think I got this in the largest size
yeah size large I don't have an extra
large but I just wanted something super
baggy I want something similar from
American Eagle that I got last year and
it's white but I really like this color
and it's so soft then I went to okay
brandi is my go-to for any kind of knit
they were having a crazy Black Friday
sale so I believe they're gonna have a
Cyber Monday one as well it's a cropped
v-neck sweater I thought this with blue
jeans would look so cute together and
some booties or winter boots and what's
great about these types of sweaters is
that they still look cute but they're
really warm and so when the weather
starts to get really cold especially if
you're from Canada like me and the
weather's already cold like dipping
below zero and you throw on a big winter
coat when you take off the coat when you
go inside somewhere then you'll have a
really cute outfit on and still be warm
but not like sweating then I got two of
the same knits they're like a crop
material raw material a cropped style
this one is I don't know what color this
is like a ten I really really liked a
color of it a lot more noir something
high-waisted again can't go wrong I
thought these colors were very like
toned and neutrals and went really well
for like the fall to winter kind of vibe
and
this one just is like a wintery blue and
I love this color so much and I think
this with either a light blue denim or
black denim would be so pretty and this
is just the same as the tan sweater just
in a blue color then one thing from
revolve revolve is also having crazy
sales right now and this is a fuzzy
everything I own is fuzzy but this is a
fuzzy sweater from measure L brought it
with me to Ireland so I actually bought
it I'd say three weeks ago but I really
really like the look of it a lot and it
has this kind of slit on the side that
ties the size medium the brandy stuff
obviously is one size yeah this is so
fuzzy you could see the material so soft
boo
and then last but not least I got things
from Windsor because a Windsor is my
absolute fave I always online shop from
Windsor you guys know again I got kind
of like a dark blue sweater but it has
these really wide sleeves with a and
they're like rolled-up permanently and a
small v-neck and this knit is so soft
it's not like a thick cable net it's
kind of like a thin knit that is look me
to look like a cable knit sweater
because of the front then I got two
sweaters they're exactly the same just
different colors again and I don't know
what to call these sweaters but they're
like off-the-shoulder fuzzy sweaters so
this is the first color it's like a wine
color really fuzzy soft material it's a
little cropped I love the look of this
and then I got the exact same one in
this color and this is like a perfect
fall color as well I wanted to do a
shoot wearing this with like the leaves
and then it started snowing and I was
like oh okay and then the last thing I
get so many questions about that
cardigan I have from Urban Outfitters
that's like super expensive to me it's
like it's worth the investment but if
you guys cannot justify spending that
much on it that much that amount on a
cardigan this is super similar oh the
sizes I think I got large and everything
because I just love large oh this is
size medium slash large and it's a very
similar cardigan but I love the color of
it I think it's so perfect with a simple
white top underneath and denim jeans so
that is
Black Friday / cyber monday / fall
transitioning into winter / pre winter
haul for you guys I hope I got I gave
you some ideas for things that you want
to wear my style is literally sweaters I
mean I'm wearing a sweater right now
that I haven't taken off so many days
because I keep throwing it over so just
so comfy I actually got it in Ireland we
went to Trinity College went to see the
library and then I go a er and it's
great obviously I don't even apologize
anymore like my closet is full of
sweaters and I don't even care so hope
you guys enjoyed this video I'll have
all links obviously listed down below I
love you guys all so much I'll see you
in my next video which I'm so excited
about okay love you guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
