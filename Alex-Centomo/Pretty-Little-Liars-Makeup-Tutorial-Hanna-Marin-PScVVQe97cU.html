hey guys i'm here today with a Hanna
Marin inspired make a tutorial if you
don't know who Hannah is she is a
character on one of my favorite TV shows
pretty little liars I'm obsessed with
that TV show it's so good I just can't
wait for the next episode to come out
each week but yeah she's one of my
favorite characters um she is blonde and
her makeup is I find just so beautiful
all the time she always has kind of like
a dark liq around the edges of her eyes
but her eyelids are normally just
neutral which I really enjoy her
eyelashes are super long and her cheeks
are normally just very flesh and pink
and her lips are either neutral or pink
and yeah the way I did my hair today was
actually inspired by one of the episodes
that I saw previously I like a picture
down below or on my blog just so you
guys can see which picture talking about
but she wears her hair like this it just
kind of a beachy curly wave just thrown
up into a ponytail with some strands
hanging down which I really like it's
super cute super fun and casual get
pretty updo so yeah I really enjoy this
look if you're interested in seeing how
i did this then yeah just keep on
watching and let's get started okay so
I'm starting off with my maybelline's
modern metallic squad I'm just going to
be taking the light champagne color and
applying it all over my lid with my max
to thirteen brush
I am then taking the orange color and
applying it with my max 217 brush to the
outer corner of the eye and just
blending it into the crease then taking
the more burgundy color applying that
into the outer corners as well and then
the brown color underneath my eyes I'm
then filling in my brows with my benefit
brow kit in the light blonde color I'm
taking the darker side just to make my
eyes a little bit more dark because how
does eye brows are much darker than mine
then taking my Maybelline quad in the
stylish smokes I'm taking the dark brown
color and applying it with an angled
brush to my upper lash line and then
going to be blending that out with my
max 217 brush again and I like to drag
into my crease as well and then taking
the light color and blending it
underneath my brow with my Sigma's large
fluff brush then taking my almay dark
black eyeliner I'm going to be applying
this to my tight line my waterline and
the top of my lash line then taking this
rocket volume Maybelline mascara I'm
going to be applying this to the top
lashes the bottom lashes and just with
two coats of that I find this mascara so
good it really makes your lashes look
full and long and just make them almost
look like you're wearing false lashes
then taking benefits they're real lash
mascara I love this mascara I'm just
applying this on top to make my lashes
look even fuller just because Hannah's
lashes are crazy long and full I'm then
taking my NARS Laguna bronzer and
applying it into the hollows of my
cheeks right under my cheekbones to
accentuate them and then I bringing the
color up onto my temples and then
contouring under my jawline
this is just going to make my face look
a lot slimmer when you're looking
straight onto my face and then I'm going
to contour my nose just to make my nose
look a little slimmer by the way I love
this brush it's from Sigma if you're
interested in where I got them i'll link
it down below using my max blush in pink
rose i'm going to be applying this to
just my cheeks the apples of my cheeks
and making my cheeks look a little bit
more flushed like Hannah's and then
taking my max mineralized skinfinish and
soft and gentle I'm going to be applying
this as a highlight to the top of my
cheekbones on the bridge of my nose and
then on my forehead and my Cupid's bow
to make my lips look fuller and then
taking my max lipstick and Angel I'm
going to be applying this to my lips and
then rubbing it out just to give it a
more natural look I'm then going to
apply this Mac color in crustash eek
it's a really nice pink pinkish orange
color um just going to apply it over top
of the angel to give it more of a pop of
color I'm then applying these earrings
that I got from forever 21 they're kind
of chain style which are really cool
there's something that Hannah would wear
because they're very edgy then applying
this long rosary necklace that I got at
little burgundy and this knotted ring I
got from a local boutique
one of them is dead okay guys so I hope
