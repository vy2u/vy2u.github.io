channel if you guys don't follow me on
any of my social media outlets like
Instagram snapchat Twitter my blogging
channel you wouldn't have known that I
was recently in New York City again I
was there with my sister and my friend
and on one of the days I did like
braided hair style on me my sister and
my friend Catherine and we've logged it
obviously and I got so many questions to
show how I did those hairstyles and how
I did them so quickly I'm just
explaining why I like to do braids so
much and so I figured I would just kind
of sit down and film a lazy hair routine
kind of thing that incorporates braids
so it's really simple to do easy
hairstyles that literally take like max
five minutes I mean I can do it like
like this because I've done it so often
I can do these hairstyles really quickly
but I ensure you the more you practice
the better you'll be braiding is not
hard you just can't give up on it I have
a lot of friends that just like say they
can braid and they just refuse to do it
because they just believe that they
can't do it but braiding is actually
really really simple especially if you
practice if you are interested in seeing
how I do some of my braided hairstyles
that are always shown on my Instagram
and all that fun stuff then just keep on
watching this is my natural hair when I
wake up in the morning after showering
the night before it's a little crazy so
I have been trying out this new curling
wand it's by bomb by hair and it is
amazing it comes with this little clamp
and also a glove so that you don't burn
yourself and I have been talking about
this on my blog for a while now because
I'm so obsessed with how fast this
curling wand curls my hair and also how
long the curls last for so all you gotta
do is brush out your hair so that there
are no tangles and then I am just
applying some heat protectant into my
hair so that it doesn't damage and look
at this like literally you curl it
around for like two seconds like
literally two to five seconds and it
gives you the craziest curl so I'm
showing you in real time here I like to
leave out a little bit of the end of my
so that it's not like curled all the way
down but as you can see the curl is like
super tight so you can even leave it for
less amount of time so you curl it all
the way around leave out the ends and I
start like a quarter of the way down and
the curls just look amazing
I also curl away from my head near my
face and then I kind of alternate each
direction so I'm going away so I'm going
towards just making sure that the pieces
that are next to my face go away from my
face just because I find that more like
a windswept look all day is nice enough
to have a coupon code for you guys so if
you use the code Alex 60 you can get
this one for $40 which is so amazing
it's a hundred percent pure titanium and
it's a 25 millimeter barrel size for
those of you guys wondering and this is
the gold collection so it's so pretty
I then brush out my curls to make them
look real good and voila this is the
finished look it's so pretty you could
literally just leave your hair like this
because it took me max five minutes to
do if you want to do some braids here
are some of my absolute favorite
hairstyles to do so this one all you got
to do is a side part I recommend so
choose wherever side you want your part
to be then you take three sections that
are close to the part and you're going
to start Dutch braiding them so you're
going to take one strand and bring it
under the middle one and then vice versa
and then you're going to start French
Dutch braiding it so you're going to
grab a little section of hair from each
side making sure that when you cross it
over you're crossing it underneath the
middle sections you can see here I'm
taking a small section from the side of
my face
bringing underneath the middle section
and connecting it to the other side and
then doing that with the other side as
well I don't know if I'm making any
sense but you can just watch this
tutorial and see how to probably do it
but it's basically just a French Dutch
braid there are literally a million
tutorials of this on YouTube but once
you get to around you ear you're just
going to stop French Dutch braiding and
just
start regular braiding all the way down
and then you're going to pull out the
hair you want to pull it out a lot to
make it look really thick and full that
is my absolute favorite when it comes to
braids and then you just want to be
careful when you get more near towards
they hear this on your head because
sometimes I pull them out too much and
it looks a little crazy but as long as
you're just being careful and pulling
gently all will be good and it looks so
pretty
so you can either pin your hair back
behind your head with a strap and the
other side and make it very bohemian and
just use a bobby pin to secure it or you
can do my favorite thing which is take a
clear elastic and just do a small side
pony and then with the curls from the
curling wand it looks so pretty
want to make sure that you pull out the
braid that's in the Pony such a
beautiful hairstyle I like to pull up
some strands across my face it's just so
bohemian and beautiful and I love
wearing my hair like this so much I
think it's so elegant
this next style is also go-to favorite
of mine once all your hair is out you
just take two sections that are on like
the front of your face and you're going
to start French fishtailing them that
was really confusing to say but
basically just a fishtail braid making
sure that the small sections from each
side are going underneath the other
section that way it ensures that the
fishtail is like laying on top of your
head rather than it being kind of all
twisted in towards your hair if that
makes sense
so once you start fishtailing a little
bit you're going to start incorporating
pieces from the crown and the sides of
your face so just taking small sections
from the outside incorporating it with
hair from your crown and bringing it
underneath and connecting it to the
other side and then once you get to the
back of your head you're just going to
start regular fishtailing all the way
down so taking a small section from each
side and fishtailing all the way down
then you're going to pull it out as much
as you want I like to make it real
Nestene bohemian as you guys know from
my past videos and pictures and
everything like that and you got this
really cool like fishtail that goes from
your forehead basically all the way down
and it looks so pretty this is
look I think it looks amazing especially
if you have different colors in your
hair but I also think that the curls
really help mix it all together and I'm
just obsessed with this hairstyle
as for the last one this actually isn't
a braid but it's like so requested for
me to do this tutorial for you guys so
it is my messy bun tutorial all you got
to do is put your hair in a ponytail
then you're going to switch the elastic
to your dominant hand and you're going
to kind of lay out all of your hair
around your head basically and take the
elastic and put it over that so it's
kind of like a donut and then you're
going to start pulling out the hair from
that donut so you just want to make it
real messy pull it out as much as you
can make it really really big and then
once that's to your desired liking
you're going to take all the excess hair
that's like around your head and you're
going to incorporate that and stick it
back into the elastic in the front and
you can be as messy as you want I just
like shove it there as much as I want
like literally this there's no science
towards this and then you're gonna pull
it out you need no bobby pins or
anything no hairspray and nothing all
you do is pull out pieces of your hair
and kind of just position it on your
head as you want and it's so pretty
guys I get so many compliments of like
this hairstyle for some reason
everyone's so obsessed with this messy
bun they always ask oh my gosh how did
you do that fun this is how I do it all
the time it's so simple it takes two
seconds and it's so pretty
