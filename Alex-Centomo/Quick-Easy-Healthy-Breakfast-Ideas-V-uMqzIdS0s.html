beautiful spring day where I live
because I'm really happy right now since
weather it's finally so nice outside
I can literally go outside in shorts
it's amazing that is why I'm rocking
this lip color because I'm just super
excited right now so I thought I would
kick off this spring little series I'm
going to do my channel with a healthy
breakfast alternative idea um I honestly
have been eating quite healthy lately
I'm very proud of myself but a little
background before I get into it I
actually eat like five or six times a
day like meal wise um I don't know how
this started but basically my body I get
full very very quickly but then I get
hungry quickly so I feel like I'm
constantly hungry throughout the day but
I can't eat like a full big meal I get
quite full so I don't know about you
guys but these are the meals that really
fill me up for the morning so I make
sure to have breakfast every single
morning I never skip it whether at work
or weather I used when I used to be in
school I never skipped breakfast
but I do make sure that I have snacks
with me throughout the day so that way
I'm never like starving because that's
not good so if you guys are interested
in seeing my breakfast ideas then just
keep on watching that was really weird
okay let's go for my first breakfast
idea you will need just one avocado make
sure it's ripe so that you can cut it
and then you also need one egg you can
use an egg white but I like the yolks
that would use the yolk and then some
bread I'm gluten intolerant so this is
my favorite gluten-free bread it's just
by Odie's and it's the regular one I
love it so much but you can substitute
whatever bread you want and then you
just cut the avocado make sure you're
careful with this because you are using
a knife and then you're just going to
want to scoop it out when you're done
with the avocado you're just going to
want to cook the egg so I put it to
medium heat on my stove and then I just
put some oil on the pan I know a lot of
people use butter but I think oil is a
little bit better just because it's less
fattening and I don't know I just prefer
it that way
crack your egg and then just cook it for
a little bit and then when that's done
on that side you're going to flip it
over and cook
on the other side I then just set that
aside to cool for a little bit and then
I spread my avocado onto my bread like
so this one is a little bit too ripe as
you can see the brown but it's you know
I worked with it and it didn't taste
gross it was fine and then I place my
egg on top and I enjoy I call this next
recipe
a healthy ant on the log version so all
you'll need is a banana some honey and
then some peanut butter or almond butter
I'm using just some natural peanut
butter and then some nuts of your choice
I really like pecans or pecans however
you want to you know say it you're then
going to carefully take your knife and
cut the banana lengthwise to create kind
of like a log shape and you can cut them
in half if you want before or afterwards
but this is just to create like the
whole ants on a log
kind of thing place your peanut butter
or your almond butter onto the banana
this is very very messy so make sure
that you wash your hands before because
it is slippery since you're kind of
applying it to the inside of the banana
you're then just going to cut your
banana in half so that way it's easier
to kind of stand on its own then you're
going to add some honey this is optional
if you don't like honey you don't have
to add this and then I add my nuts on
top of that and it just makes the most
incredible breakfast ever I love it it's
so tasty and it's actually very filling
so that's a big reason as to why I
really like this
this last recipe is my absolute favorite
it is a smoothie recipe all you will
need is some carrots and apple then some
frozen fruit I really like frozen banana
strawberries and blueberries and then
you will also need hemp hearts and some
chia seeds and then of course coconut
water and this is all very good for you
and also very filling
I then juice the two carrots and the
apples if you don't have a juicer you
can totally skip this step I just really
find that the carrots and the apples
aren't perfect with this smoothie then I
add in my frozen fruit with all the
other ingredients into this blender I
blend it up and I enjoy guys this is
seriously so good and it really does
fill me up
not to mention all of the health
benefits from the chia seeds and the
hemp arts they are very good for you and
then just the fruit gives you a nice
kickstart for the day and helps with
your brain and just helps a lot of
things guys trust me try it and let me
know in the comments below or tweet me
pictures or something because seriously
I'm like very excited about this right
now but it's really good
just look how good that looks guys oh my
gosh I'm craving this right now so I'm
probably gonna go make this after I
finish recording this let me know in the
comments down below which was your

I love to kind of like switch around I
love that so much like I said before I
don't need a huge breakfast to get me
going it just needs something in my
stomach and that way I kind of like
continuously eat throughout the day make
