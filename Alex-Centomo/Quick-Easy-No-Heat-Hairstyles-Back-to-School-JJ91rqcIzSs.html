my channel I have been getting so many
requests requests from you guys to do a
back to school here style tutorial just
like simple and easy no heat involved
hair styles and I actually a few
tutorials like this on my channel
already but it's been a while since I've
done one and I figured why not so I
washed my hair last night I woke up this
is my natural hair like this is
literally I slept with it damp and some
pieces are like knotted and crazy and
some on our flat and dead on top like
this is just the mess I have to deal
with every single day as a kid I had
like afro literally ringlets and then as
I started swimming a lot and every sub
every 7 years your hair kind of changes
so this is what is left now so I figured
I would show you guys some things that
you could do like in five minutes just
quick and easy super simple and look
really cute and looks like you kind of
took more time now obviously this is
things I do for my type of hair if you
guys have straighter hair or curly your
hair I guess you can make adjustments
based off of yourself and what you like
better but this just works really well
for me and I like them so first
hairstyle all you need to do is part
your hair in a middle part does not have
to be perfect literally I just did this
with my fingers I kind of like messy
hair this is the thing about me is that
I like bohemian messy hair so the
Messier the better that's just me though
you guys don't have to follow exactly
what I do so this is actually the most
simple thing ever and every time I wear
it I get so many questions about you
guys are actually gonna laugh but the
first thing I'm going to do is little
pigtails so all you need are tiny clear
elastics you can get this at the dollar
store that's where I got mine I grabbed
just a piece of my hair that's a little
bit lower than my jawline and I do a
loose pony so I'll wrap it around just
twice so it's really loose and then I'll
kind of pull out some pieces at the top
maybe I'll pull out like a little tiny
bang piece so that's out
then I'll just tighten it up this is
probably the easiest type of hairstyle
you could do and this will take you
literally two seconds but it's really
cute I love it I see it all the time on
people this is the first one takes two
seconds it looks really cute with a hat
too but just very simple and easy
yeah messy messy is the way to go I see
so many people rocking this look you can
even do like sometimes what I do is I
take the hair and I go as if you're
going to do a braid but you make it
really loose so I always turn underneath
the middle strands so I go one two three
four times and then I tie it there so
you have like the whole rest of the hair
hanging out but it's just really loose
and big and cute I don't know this is
just like super in for me right now
there you have it it's just cute I know
I really like it the next one is a half
updo so you put all your hair behind
your head making sure that middle part
is still kinda there then you're going
to grab two pieces on top of your ears
so you still have like hair above your
ears move oh my god I sound so Canadian
above your ears then you grab the hair
behind your head I'm just going to turn
around so you guys could see what I'm
doing so you have the two strands like
this going to put it in a ponytail
make sure it's a little loose
then you're going to take this piece and
you're going to braid it once this is
braided you could leave it like that but
I want to pull it out
and what's great about this is that
looks so cute from behind but also
really cute in the front if you pull out
a few strands to kind of frame your face
you see how the side kind of still goes
over your ears it's just really pretty
so the next one is actually going to be
a French braid French Dutch braid that
kind of goes on the side of your head
you want to make sure that all of your
hair is to the side like that you're
going to take front section of your hair
this does not have to be small it just
like what does this an inch and you're
going to start braiding so you take
three sections and you're going to braid
underneath the middle piece because that
creates the Dutch braid so you go one
under under then you start collecting a
small section from the outside and
bringing it under the middle
the outside again bringing it under the
middle
it's basically a French braid on the
side of your face this keeps the hair
out of your face throughout the day and
still looks super cute the rest and just
braid it all the way down kind of
pulling back behind your head then
you're going to take your elastic secure
it and then you're going to pull out
again up to you but I love this part
I love braids that look big I have a guy
friend that had really long hair once
and I braided his hair and like a big
fishtail thing and it looked so cool now
the places around your face you want to
be careful you don't to pull out too
much
it's also easier if this is second day
hair because my hair so clean right now
that it's like not sticky you know that
like textured feeling and then you take
the braids and you go underneath the
rest of your hair and you wrap it around
and then you would use a bobby pin to
secure but I actually don't have one so
I'm just gonna use another clear elastic
because Yolo does what happens when I
would get ready really fast in the
morning I would just like find whatever
there you go
super cute
and for the last hairstyle this is like
actually the easiest thing of life and
still looks super cute so when I was a
swimmer I would always have my hair in a
bun all the time and I forgot I used to
do my hair like this so take a big
elastic preferably the color of your
hair I only had a black one because I
don't know where all my blond ones went
but take an elastic that does the color
of your hair but it's still bigger so
you're going to do a bun the way that I
like to do my bun does a simmer is kind
of like this area so it's not too high
not too low and a little bit on the side
I don't know why so you take all your
hair you bring it behind and then you're
just going to go around halfway collect
the hair go back around stick a bunch
out and then pull on it
that's it it's the craziest easiest
hairstyle obviously I pull out pieces in
the front and I kind of bring up the top
but I used to wear this all the time and
it's so easy and I wear it a lot in my
blogs and people always ask me and I'm
just like it's the easiest thing so
literally I feel like most of you know
how to do that already but I just think
it's so cute
sorry about that this would like bomber
jacket some leggings and the sneakers
it's just simple cropped II I love it
because it's like sporty but chic so I
hope you guys enjoyed this video let me

you do recreate any of these looks tag

very simple but they're super cute and I
definitely would wear these in school so
