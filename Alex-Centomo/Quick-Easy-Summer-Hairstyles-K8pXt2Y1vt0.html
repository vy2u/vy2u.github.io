channel first off I just wanted to say a
big thank you to all of you guys for
being so awesome and supporting my
travel diary so much and also just like
being great by following me on all my
social medias like I've been having so
much fun interacting with you guys on
everything but anyways with that aside I
just wanted to get right into this video
because I get so many requests to do
hair videos and I don't know I love
doing different hairstyles know summer
is here finally the weather is nice
where I live and it's just like I'm so
happy and I've been experimenting of
course with so many different hairstyles
I just decided to do something a little
bit different today because it is summer
and because there are so many different
things you can do different events for
parties differently picnic any type of
like summer activity I figured I would
show you three different hairstyles that
you could do for that event very easy at
home super simple
very quick and you end up looking super
cute also I just want to give a huge
thank you to Pantene for partnering with
me on this video so I can create awesome
content for you guys and show you some
of my favorite products at the moment so
if you're curious to see how I achieve
some of these hairstyles thank you for
watching how many healthy hair is the
key to creating the perfect hairstyle
and perhaps starts in the shower I have
been using the Pantene expert collection
in intense hydration and this stuff is
amazing after the first wash my hair
felt so soft and smooth they instantly
quench my hair with moisture but for
that extra moisture I love to use the 3
minute miracle I use this in another
video actually which I will link down
below but it helps in my hair is extra
dry aka when I spend too much time in
the pool and it's awesome because it
adds fullness to find your flat hair
which is me and it helps to tame frizz
which is also awesome a lot of people
ask me how I get my natural curls and
normally I wash my hair at night and
then I actually have been using this
mousse and this is the Pantene curl
defining mousse so this stuff is great
it lasts all day even through humidity
it protects my curls from getting frizzy
which is another great thing and my hair
even I just like wearing it natural like
this as well but since we are going to
be styling for an event I'm
to be showing you my new favorite way to
do my hair so first things first
brushing out your hair this is very
important because the way we'll be
styling it you'll need to have 0 knots
so just gently brush it you can use a
wet brush comb whatever you want I find
with my hair personally when it's dry I
like to use a brush my hair just gets so
shiny and I just love the way it looks
so then you are going to take a
straightener of any size whatever you
want it depends on how big you want the
curls and you're going to wrap your hair
around the straightener and pull
downwards so I do like one way and then
I switch and do the other way so one
piece is going away from my face one
piece is going towards making sure that
the hair that's closest to my face is
going away from my face so as you can
see I'm turning the hair around the wand
and pulling it down like that creates a
really cute curl I actually have a
tutorial on this that I found like two
years ago and I think it's my most
viewed video but so many people are so
confused on how to do it and honestly
this is as best as I can explain because
I've been doing this for years so I
literally just like twist it around and
pull it doesn't have to be perfect but
you know that's just what I like to do
and it just leaves the cutest prettiest
beachy loose curls and I just love the
way this looks it's very natural and it
doesn't give the same curl as a curling
wand I don't know it just it's so
different and so pretty and I don't do
this often but whenever I do this I get
so many compliments and so many people
asking questions on how I do my hair so
you're just going to do this all over
you can separate your hair however you
want
and this is how it turns out I think it
looks so pretty it's just very natural
and yeah I just like loose waves then
going in with the ultimate 10 BB cream I
love this because it makes my hair look
super shiny and smooth it's like a ten
in one hair Perfector so it provides
like so many different things repair for
rough hair strengthen gets damaged silky
softness shine moisture wrist control
tames flyaways all that kind of stuff it
just allows my hair to be easily styled
without excess static or flyways you can
use it before or after I prefer to use
it after just because it just really
does help tame the flyaways which is
very common during the summer months for
me so this next hairstyle you are just
going to grab a piece of hair on top of
your head and you're going to be
twisting the strand and twirling it
around each other kind of creating a
space bun but you want to be very loose
so don't be too tight with it I mean
it's personal preference also but I
personally like when it's loose then
you're going to take a clear elastic and
just secure that in place
I usually twist around three times
ensuring that the piece of hair is still
very loose and what's great about this
is that you can actually just position
the bun any way you want you could pull
it out because it is supposed to be
messy it looks really cool and then you
want to make sure that you still have
hair covering your ears just but that is
again my personal preference I like that
then you're going to do the same thing
to the other side if ever you find
there's like pieces that aren't like in
place or you want to position it
differently you can totally use bobby
pins to you know kind of position the
bun how you like it I personally just
like them loose like this I can get so
cute it's kind of like a different take
on the space bun
/ Princess Leia and I think it's so cute
for summer then going in with my much
favorite Pantene hair spray you guys
know I love this because I talk about it
all the time and if you guys didn't know
this is the first ever alcohol-free
aerosol hairspray it gives a really
flexible hold there's natural movement
there's no like stiffness
doesn't feel crunchy or anything so it's
a very flexible hold and so it allows
you to like brush and layer the formula
as many times as you wish and also
because it has no alcohol it smells
really good which you know I love and I
just I'm so obsessed with this hairstyle
like look how cute it is I think it's so
fun and some people ask me how I do it
and it's really simple so that's it on
to the last hairstyle this is more of a
bohemian look Sophia but got really nice
dinner or picnic or something that you
want to wear a really cute dress I think
it would be awesome so taking a piece of
hair that's near the crown of your head
and just twisting it and wrapping it
behind you're going to secure both
pieces together with a clear elastic or
a bobby pin whatever you want then
pulling some strands out to make sure
it's a little messy you can leave it
like that because I think it's super
cute but what I love to do is add a
random braid and you know me you know I
love my braids so you're just going to
do a regular three strand braid and you
just want to make sure that you leave
some pieces out and then you're gonna
pull apart the braid to make it super
thick because you guys know I love me
some thick braids
I'm not the biggest fan of like really
tight braids but again like I always say
it's personal preference then what I
like to do is actually just put a little
bit of hairspray on top to make sure
that my little flyaways and baby hairs
stay down um and also I could just kind
of position the hair how I'd like it and
I think this is so pretty I would
totally wear this to a summer picnic or
a summer dinner I'm actually this a
barbecue this weekend that I'm going to
totally rock this hairstyle too so I
really loved it and yeah I just feel
really girly in it and I think I'd be
really pretty with a dress
so I hope you guys enjoyed this video if
