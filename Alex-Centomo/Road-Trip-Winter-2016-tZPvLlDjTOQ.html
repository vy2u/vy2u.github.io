channel on my vlogging camera again this
time I feel like I have not posted a
vlog style video on this channel in a
while and I know a lot of you really
liked the travel vlog I did for the
Hamptons when I was there and I figured
I would do another one so I'm actually
going on a little mini road trip to
Toronto Ontario Ontario Toronto Ontario
Canada and I'm really excited because
I've actually only been to Toronto a few
times and I don't really know much like
what what's to do there and stuff so I
am super excited to go explore again and
I'm going with Daniel obviously he's the
one back here doing all the dishes thank
you
another really awesome thing we actually
leave tomorrow morning but I want to
talk with me about the fact that Telus
sent me an iPhone 7 for this trip how
crazy is that so
Telus if you guys don't know it's a
network here in Canada but specifically
on Ontario it's like the biggest network
and I'm so excited to test it out
because I really want to see how good
the network is plus it's just really
really good for keeping connected I
haven't had a black phone in a long time
so I'm so excited to play around with
this for the whole entire time that I'm
in Toronto and I'm really really
grateful about it so I figured right now
I would show you guys what it's like
when I decide what to pack and bring on
my small little road trip packing for a
big trip it's a lot different than
packing for something really small so
let's get to it this is my closet room
it's not complete yet I still have a
bunch of stuff I need to bring in with a
bunch of shoes and stuff and I don't
know what I want to wear and I think I'm
just gonna bring not me a big suitcase
I'll probably bring either a small one
or my duffel bag
okay so what I've kind of picked out so
far which I don't think is gonna fit in
there oh no this is my problem I always
overpack but I have obviously a great
sweater in case I feel like wearing that
because it's a little chillier or
whatever I have this in case it's
something that's a bit more dressy like
for night this is just cute with jeans
so doesn't matter I have two hats
because I'm not sure which one this faux
fur jacket is from revolve not just to
wear like mainly in the car or when it's
colder outside then I have pajama pants
to sleep in I have some leggings to work
out in some loose-fitting
jeans which are super comfy I just need
to get my high-waisted jeans but I think
those are in the wash so I need to get
those then here I couldn't decide
between these two tops I'm just going to
bring both because they're really thin
and cropped and I'll wear them with
something high-waisted and then this
oversized denim jacket will be cute
so it's all packed up but the good thing
about driving is I could just throw
these things in the car it doesn't
matter and this I just need to put some
bras and underwear that's what I'll be
wearing in the car with these shoes so
we are currently on the road first
things first I'm going to enter the
address of how to get there because I
have no idea how to get to the hotel
this is my background there's a little
puppy that I found on tumblr is still
cute so it's 4 hours and 44 minutes
should be there by 1:07 and we're gonna
go let's do it
name one thing you really love about
road trips I like driving let's say you
weren't the driver what would you like
it's still fun like you just get to hang
out you're like in the car listen to
music you get to see things I don't know
if it's just really fun
I like that I also like the
conversations you have when you're in a
car ride with somebody I know when I
Drive to New York all the time the most
intense conversations and deep talks and
you leave feeling so good it's like a
therapy session it's also really fun to
drive and look at all the nature I just
think it's really really cool and then
you have to see people's taste in music
you get to see how people like to listen
to music because I feel like a lot of
friends that they either like to listen
to the full song or they listen to like
part of the song and they have to switch
it like the cat listen to the whole
thing and I feel like I'm a mix between
both like if I really like a song I need
to listen to the whole song
but if I'm like okay I don't
I asked you guys on Instagram where to
go and some of you said to stop in
Kingston so right now we have told that
that 12 minutes teller there's as to go
here and then I think we're gonna find
some food because we're hungry but so
far
I'd say like two and a half hours left
before we get to Toronto venturing down
this random road I don't know where we
are
but I literally typed in Kingston
Ontario and that's where we're going so
far so good don't know what's there I've
never been there before or do any of you
guys live here I think I'd be pretty
cool
run Montreal Street that's cool cuz
that's where we're from this is a cute
little town don't see food though
hopefully we're gonna get to the Main
Street like it says Brock Street Queen
Street and Princess Street
the cool buildings
have you ever been here before never
interesting so we have now just parked
and are gonna probably just get some
food because we're starving and then
head back on the road to go to Toronto
sounds really cute and yeah never been
here before comment down below if you're
from Kingston Ontario
we made it okay guys so we just got to
the hotel room it's really cute I'll
give you a little tour in the background
there we go we're staying at the
Intercontinental in Yorkville which is
in Toronto and what I'm gonna do now is
when I post it on Instagram when was it
two days ago I asked you guys things to
do this weekend in Toronto I really want
to know what there was to do because
I've been here a few times but I've
never actually explored it's always been
for like meetings and stuff so I've gone
like to the meeting come back we've
usually ordered up host meets what
whatever it is that's like you can just
order food dance with some packing back
there here are a few things that people
said to do when we were here
Kensington Market Queen West distillery
district everyone keeps saying Queen
Street for it's amazing for shopping and
so is Kensington Market bunner's Bakery
is a must it's all vegan and gluten free
oh my god that's awesome
Cafe crepe on Queen seems like Queen
Street has like the most things CN Tower
everyone keeps commenting seeing saying
like her neeta's for tacos and then the
Yorkville neighborhood in general super
cute which is where we are so I feel
like so far what I see mostly is like
Kensington Market your fill which is
where we are Queen Street and a few
restaurants for us to check out so I
think what we're gonna do is probably
head out on the street I'm gonna change
and walk around for a bit and see what's
up see we're we're close by and just
figure it out from there I'm gonna you
know I don't want to take off this hat
because my hair is so greasy so I might
just switch it up because this one's
like
of intense people keep like staring at
me look guys flowers came for me how
pretty little no oh don't you put it
smells different here
that's not what I meant but okay well

pronounce it war
BL oh oh ah we are now walking in this
direction down this really pretty Street

gluten-free Bakery but I'm so full right

looking and so pink
my glasses right now they're so fogged
up I'm not hungry do you want anything
so we have made it to Queen Street West
have no idea what we're looking for
we're just walking it's cold
honestly to not realize it was going to
be this cold outside
it's pretty neat reminds me of Chinatown
in New York City everything's like super
close together and busy that's finally
getting cold
y'all put some green tea freshly
squeezed orange juice Dan got his own
breakfast and he's already done his
orange juice now I have my chokers on

into
sir
so we just got back to the hotel now
after the event it was so much fun
unfortunately cat show it yet I'm gonna
have a video all about it coming out
next week I'm so excited for you guys to
see it it was really inspiring it was an
emotional day it was a good positive day
and I don't know I'm just really happy I
did it but now we are starving we have
not eaten since breakfast when I had my
oatmeal which is actually really good it
filled me up for a long time I go didn't
feel like I was starving until now when
I'm actually done work and I can think
about food maybe we'll try that place
that everyone keeps telling us a Trilok
carnitas or something for tacos the
vegetarian ones okay the camera battery
literally just died I changed my shirt
we are heading to LA carnitas
because that is the place that we feel
like eating and I looked on the menu
look like it was all meat but there's
one that seems vegetarian so I'm hoping
I can just have that
if not I'll ask them just to like put
all the toppings and just not meat
hopefully that's okay but we need to go
right now thanks to all of you guys on
instagram for all the shout outs after
that we're gonna go to the distillery
district because that's the other thing
a lot of you guys told me to check out
so I'm gonna go there and see what's up
okay so one of the restaurants I was
recommended was called Barca
so we're currently here right now it's
really cute so cute
are excited to eat
like the restaurant
wine bottles you can see the cooking
right there
we're here it's such a random time -
this is her lunch one of the really cool
things about Toronto in New York that
the skyscrapers like the big towers are
really really tall and I don't know why
but in Montreal they're not as tall do
you know why there's a reason there's a
law you actually don't know there's a
law that says no building can go higher
than this the cross on the top of Mount
Royal oh that's the reason but it's
really neat when you're in your
especially Newark but Toronto is like
look at this yeah like they go so high
that one is just so tall and we're not
used to it so it's neat another really
cool thing is the fact that
in Toronto
it's all English
all the signs and everything is in
English oh my gosh there is a sparkly
tree and I'm freaking out hold on do you
guys see that look at that
it's sparkly tree and it's not a
Christmas tree that's so nice
I love you
together what do you mean we're gonna I
don't like
it's times like these where you really
don't feel like working out and you're
gonna go and do it I'm gonna kick my own
butt it's gonna be good
and I should probably take my makeup off
before I go because I hate working out
with makeup on but I'm lazy so I'm too
lazy to take my makeup off but I'm not
lazy no to a gym makes no sense workout
done and I feel like crap
I'm tired Dan how was your workout good
really that's good
me doing no breakfast this morning is
low-fat yogurt with granola and fruit
some ice water and some freshly squeezed
orange juice which looks amazing
