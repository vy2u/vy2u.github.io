another episode of cribs out to tone
style I try feeding its artwork curtains
on this side window this is my mirror
which i think is super flattering
because it's a scanner so it makes you
look really good and then I just throw
my robot because you will see I have
paintings which say doubled on both
which whatever is just shoes that I have
my actual shoes down here these are like
my fall / winter boots that I will be
using I took away all my summer stuff
plus I have my running shoes right here
because I run like every single day just
Doc Martens Fry's fake Doc Martens which
I got from go Jane comm like four years
ago
got my Birkenstocks one shoe two covers
will chibita shoes that's basically all
I work over here I have my perfumes
which I literally don't use any of them
except for misty or in the summer time
and then I actually just bought this one
yesterday which is II Elizabeth and
James Nirvana the black one because I'm
kind of late on this whole bandwagon
thing but I wanted this that for a long
time when I keep oriented for and spray
it on myself and I get so many
compliments this part over here I have
just my glasses this tea cup from
Anthropologie I just keep my rings and
stuff in here
and I have toothbrushes because I just
don't leave them in my bathroom I don't
know
then in here's the kind of like a bunch
of junk I have like four strips plus
some medication some hair ties gloss
this thing it's a ten which I use for my
hair over here I have my makeup bag
which is by Avery Bendel and I got this
in New York
then over here I just have my makeup
brushes leave and then in this one I
have just like a bunch of stuff like
hair products based products some like
powders deodorant all that oh I have a
friend body scrub Plus this tiny mint
okay then over here I just have this big
mason jar which I throw my lush products
in because not only does it make the
room smell amazing but it just like easy
access like if we wanted to go out there
just grab one and get up to the top so
this is kind of a mess like I said I'm
not perfect and I honestly joiners you
this section I have like five products
here some hats another time and just
like crap and then over here is the
closet which is broken I don't know how
this happened so soil
I kind of a regent you're like this
season's I don't have a walk-in closet
or a big closet so like this is always
an issue for me since it's winter slash
ball I have like all my sweaters plus my
jackets long-sleeve shirts pants
everything is just accessible right here
that I will be grabbing most often and
in the summertime will usually have like
tank tops t-shirts and all that kind of
stuff and I also kind of try to arrange
it by like color coordination so like
from light to dark with each section up
here I have two bins which these are
shorts and some shirts these are hats
then I just have some jump over there
down here have a garbage Plus this
heater fun a lot of people ask me what
this is this actually just heats up my
room and it's awesome then over to this
side of the room I have some more junk
kinda throw stuff here that's easy
accessible so like my camera equipment
like snap sacks and slippers and I'm
like a guy with my extensions and
supergroups
then over here I just have this
nightstand which is from JC pero I
believe as well as like all the other
furniture in my room it's also JC bro
and then I just have candles it's like
Eiffel Tower thing this glass down on
the seashell and some rocks that I got
from Vancouver and then you move over to
my bed this world action happens right
stitch so yeah this is my bed my bed is
never made to be honest like it's never
made
I made it specifically for this video I
have this blanket here which is from
Target I like to have a blanket on my
bed because I get really cold even
though like I have a duvet I just like
to have a blanket to and then these
pillows are from Target the two brown
lines plus this and right here I have
stitch and mr. crocodile which is a
koala bear which my boyfriend made me
then I just around some pixie lights
which are not even or nice at all but
whatever and then over here I just have
another nightstand which is literally
full of junk as my boyfriend's computer
is here disease is it then he has his
hard drive I got this count over name
which is fresh fresh balsam I don't want
to say that I have this big armoire
which is from Jason row again it's like
a white kind of like faded looking barn
thing I just really like it inside I
have a bunch of stuff so over here I
just have like my teas my new e products
some bags over here I have like pills
and stuff I have
cold effects I have some old candles of
change in them then I have shoes over
here and then I have jewelry in here
which this jewelry is just simple
jewelry it's like my pyramid of stuff my
Melanie r3 my no Matic store it's
nothing fancy so this painting I just I
love Marilyn Monroe she was such an icon
and I just really like this beauty
because it's a different painting then
you would mostly see I mean it's not the
generic like sexy face she just looks
super happy looking over above me in New
York City and I just thought it was
really nice so this painting is actually
a painting of Paris because when I
originally painted my room I wanted kind
of a Paris see that's why I have like
the Eiffel Tower and like example don't
glow paints over there and I just really
liked this painting this black and white
kind of like the theme I was going for
so that's about it for my room but
honestly like I don't know how long I'm
going to be living here for so I never
actually like finished up my room or
made it like anything spectacular but
when I do move out and I get my own room
I'm definitely going to
like really decorate it kind of a tumblr
style like that's my main thing is that
I really want to have a good tumblr
themed room
so you guys enjoyed that video um like
you saw I don't have the most perfect
room it's kind of messy and stuff but at
the same time I don't know how much
longer I'll be living here for so I
wanted to show you what it looked like
before I moved out because so many of
you guys requested this and I hope you
guys enjoyed it don't forget to give it
a big thumbs up if you did it and
subscribe for more also let me know in
the comments which video would like to

night wherever you are in the world and
