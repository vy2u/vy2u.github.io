sister again I asked you guys on
Instagram today to ask us some questions
because we begin a lot of requests
actually to do a Q&amp;amp;A video together so
we thought it'd be a fun idea yes we're
just gonna answer your questions so
let's get right into it we got so many
questions like a ridiculous amount i
screen shot at a few because I uploaded
like an hour ago
and we almost have like a thousand
questions the user Kim L with two three
eyes sorry it's too confusing when
there's too many of the same letter yeah
three eyes so she asks do you guys ever
wish you had another sibling um
I don't wish for you do I don't like
wish for another sibling like I'm all
like oh I want my parents to have
another child really bad but we always
wondered what would it would be like to
have like a brother
yeah an older brother like I don't like
I don't actually wish for another
sibling it's true but I always thought
like I wonder what it would be like to
have an older brother cuz my mom was
supposed to have a boy before my sister
but it was a miscarriage yeah so
technically we kind of should have an
older brother but who knows mom and dad
always wanted two kids if we would have
had the older brother maybe you wouldn't
then he's true so I'm glad that she
didn't
that sounds bad then yeah but we always
were thinking like like our brother
would be so good looking
yeah I'm like he'd be like so cool
really sporty yeah it'd be like a soccer
player I feel like dad yeah yeah my dad
was a soccer player my grandfather was a
professional soccer player and I feel
like you would kind of be like little
Ricky no he would look he would be like
Leonardo DiCaprio he would have the
smaller eyes yeah and like have a
lighter hair but he wouldn't have liked
the dark eyebrows we're going so in
depth ya know like we're like talking
about are like hot non-existent brother
it's weird
the best is when we are talking about it
with Catherine she's like a crush on
okay yeah my brain cats like I'd have a
crush on yet Gabrielle dot Belen Jay
asks what's your favorite thing to do
together probably for me would be film
videos
I think for me I have a lot of things
that we what we do a lot of things that
are Oh watch scary movies probably watch
the game at least bill lake remember we
used to go for drives yeah yeah I liked
going on drugs with you I love like
those days that we'd get like junk food
and just like watch like scary stuff
like even documentaries that are like a
messed up like we like watching that
kind of stuff yeah I don't know I can't
say there's one specific things thing we
do so many things together that I like
we're very similar but we're also very
different yeah that's weird but we like
doing the same things we like the same
activities Selina underscore pro route
asks favorite memory together hmm we
haven't like look at these questions
beforehand so I mean where you're not
prepared at all I have like once again I
have so many memories with you this is
probably just on my mind because we were
at the cottage two days ago but when we
were younger my mother Peppo was still
alive when we'd go to the cottage and
just like okay I'm like we jump off the
sandpit there yeah all that we'd go for
walks and people would pick off the
raspberries and the plans and like feed
it to us I think one of them ah it's
really hard to decide but I have a very
distinct memory I don't know if you'll
remember this or not my really good
friend Lee says a child we used to do a
lot of activities together in this
summer and there was one time where my
family and her family went to the beach
and me and her me and my friend were
like very close and we didn't like to
have these sisters to play with us like
we didn't like it cuz we were like oh
they're going whatever and we are silly
on to but I remember this one time we
went to the beach and we really wanted
you to play with us I don't know what it
was but we got nerd gumballs gumballs
with little nerds inside of them the
candy and we're sitting there and
sharing them and just laughing and I
just remember like it was the first time
I thought like you were cool yeah it was
just like the first time I was like my
sister can hang out with us she's fun
you know like and I don't remember how
maybe I was 10 I don't really remember
was like very young like we're still
children but I still do distinctly
remember that memory they're just funny
cuz it was like the first time I was
like
you're okay from Ginty dot free guard
the question is what are your favorite
things about each other I would say my
favorite thing about my sister is the
fact that because like I see my friends
and like how they are with their
siblings and none of them have like a
really close relationship with their
siblings like I know they a lot of my
friends true they have like brothers and
stuff but like out of my friends that
have sisters like they're not really
that close with their sisters is like as
close as we are and like you boys you've
always been like open with me so like
helps me be open with you kind of thing
you know I feel like because you were
comfortable with me I was comfortable
with you I feel like the same thing with
you too you know it's just for me what I
really like about Kyla is that she's
really really good with advice really
yeah but she's bad at taking her own
advice yeah about it to me she's so good
at giving advice like even my friends
will talk to her about problems and
stuff you know and then she'll like have
this like awesome insight that you would
never think of before and like she
always takes the mature road but then
like when she's innocent Oh such a
similar situation it's like hard for you
- yeah - take your own advice yeah I
mean because it's like when emotions
involved it's completely exactly it's so
easy to see something from outside
perspective when you aren't emotionally
involved in something yeah yeah I think
that's one of my favorite things about
you is that like you're good at advice
not that you're that you don't take your
own advice that you're good yeah I go to
her for advice a lot X load diver X load
X low X low Deaver excellent yeah
whatever
asks do you argue often um we argue
definitely because we're siblings but I
wouldn't say we argue more than we are
like on good terms like the good
outweighs the bad
yeah when we were younger we fought a
lot more like our relationship wasn't as
good as it is now because especially in
high school when you're going through
like all those emotional a hormonal yeah
you know so you've obviously sisters
siblings especially one of the closest I
would say that like wool age will
disagree on certain things like it wants
to get back to the advice thing
sometimes like when you go to like I'll
go to you for advice and you tell me
something that I don't want to hear and
I'll get like upset I'll go against and
you're like okay than like why were you
guys yeah like we'll argue about things
like diet I like will argue about like
stupid things yeah well it used to be
like we used to always argue about
clothing in high school like used to
steal each other's clothes all the time
and then like hide it
yeah we were like no I didn't take it
it's like you did but that was like the
main thing we would argue about now it's
more like what she said or honestly I
think that's what it is it's really just
right for movie we're just about
everything like you know when you're
just like hungry and moody or it's like
that time of month and you're just like
well yeah and like everything is just
getting on your nerves
yeah it's sure but like our arguments -
they don't last that long but that's the
funny thing about us is that we'll argue
about something and then like five
minutes later be best friends again ya
know and normally it's because you'll
just be like Kailah and you'll ask me a
question you'll be all happy in the
gamete now I have to be mature and be
nice oh really yeah oh I probably just
forgot that we were fighting - yeah
we're gonna fight this is angels life
asks why didn't you guys start a YouTube
channel together
um I think just because I started my
first like a years before she did yeah
like she was into YouTube for years
before I ever got into YouTube and when
you started making your YouTube channel
I still wasn't that into YouTube so like
I never really like understood it I
started watching well it was ever since
you showed me Alpina's video and then I
started watching him so he's like the
first youtuber started watching and then
I actually got into it and I was like I
start watching Zooey and then I found
Tanya burn and that's yeah I was like oh
my god I love Tanya
so that's honestly why just because I
started at first I'm here I don't know
if he would have started together anyway
so I don't know how that would work
because we're so different our styles
are so different
yeah all right the way you would argue
too much and like we don't like filming
the same kinds of videos no you know
Ryan obstacles Jim how are you see which
one of you talks way too much that it
annoys
everyone in the world that's my
boyfriend you
I think Ryan talks too much to be honest
it just doesn't stop
he's so annoying and then you also ask
who has longer hair me yeah let's see oh
damn it you got lasered oh yeah I just
don't have much hair I'm a Shamus Alan
