my channel I'm hanging out with my puppy
oh that's but the guys are kind of at an
awkward angle like an upwards angle so
I'm sorry if you've seen this double
chin but you know it's really okay also
I put on this face tan stuff the first
time I use it obviously right before I
film a video and it kind of looks like
mine anyways so I'm really excited for
this video because for so many different
reasons first of all I love hauls
they're my favorite videos to watch
because I'm super nosy I also like
filming them because not that it's like
easy but I like to show you guys what I
buy to give you inspiration for future
outfits or if you're going on trips or
anything like that as you guys know with
my hauls I like to kind of give ideas of
what I would wear with an item of
clothing and kind of how I would make an
outfit with it but also because this
haul is for my Bachelorette if you guys
don't know I am engaged I am extremely
excited but also very very nervous for
my wedding day it's in the fall I'm not
nervous to like get married I'm nervous
for the wedding I want the day to be
good walking down the aisle just like
freaks me out
I don't know I just lots of emotions
going on dad I thought you're gonna turn
off the fan oh okay okay I know it's
fine if you guys hear a little bit of
like air just because I have a fan on
right next to me I don't think you guys
will hear it but just in case so my
Bachelorette is in Greece this is
literally a dream I could not be more
excited Greece is my favorite place in
the entire world that I've been I've
traveled a lot but Santorini will always
have a close place in my heart it was
just so amazing
this time we're actually going to
Mykonos Mykonos I don't know how to
pronounce it let me know if you're from
there or if you're from Greece if I'm
saying that completely wrong is it
Mykonos or Mykonos anyways we're going
there for my Bachelorette and then we're
going to Santorini after kind of
confusing but I'm actually going to
Spain beforehand with some friends and
then we are flying over to Mykonos Dan
and Pat are gonna go off and do their
own thing all my girls are flying in but
are getting my wedding party we're all
meeting up in Mykonos and we're gonna be
there for like I think it's at five days
or something and do a bunch of fun
activities and then go to Santorini
after and I'm just so excited guys like
I'm so excited just everyone that I
like one place so I'm gonna show you
guys what I'm deciding to bring with me
to Mykonos because I feel like
everything I picked is basically what
I'm gonna be wearing okay bye and I
thought this would be fun to kind of
give you a sense of like how I pack and
stuff or a warmer weather vacation but
also give you a sense of my outfits that
I think of while I'm packing so I don't
know if that's making any sense anyways
if you guys are new here make sure to
hit that subscribe button down below and
also turn on the post notifications so
you guys are notified I'm getting so
many comments lately saying that you're
not seeing with my videos are going up
if you are new if you want to be able to
see more of me which would be awesome
then make sure to click that and now
it's annoying you have to say notify all
the time I don't know it's so weird but
if you do that and also give this video
a thumbs up if you are excited to see
videos from my Bachelorette so I'm
definitely me filming while I'm there
I'm going to be enjoying the moment as
much as possible but I do want to
document it because it's a passion of
mine and I love it whether or not I
decide to upload it but I'm definitely
to be filming so if I get enough thumbs
up and I definitely will upload it I'm
not gonna go based off of Brad's I'm
just gonna go based off of what's around
me and kind of explain why I'm bringing
it and the output I'm thinking up so the
first thing I'm gonna talk about is this
top it's so cute and just so beautiful I
picture myself wearing this in Greece I
definitely need a strapless nude bra
because you could see how see-through
this is and when I tried it on it's just
it's also very overexposed because all
of a sudden the Sun decided to come out
very very cute I definitely need the
strapless bra with this and I don't own
one right now because I never wear bras
I always wear bra let's but I don't
watch straps so I'm gonna have to go get
something but this is from princess
Polly and this isn't a size large and
the reason why I get largest because I'm
very broad on my shoulders I mean I
don't really need to explain why I'm
getting a size I don't know why I'm
explaining it but if you guys do have
broader shoulders the sizes I find with
Australia are like so different than
North America it's always hard to know
but usually size medium or large I'm
good if things are off the shoulder I
typically go a high size above because
of my broad shoulders then I got this
off the shoulder strapless top and this
is from Windsor this is a size medium
because I know
size is pretty well but how cute is this
first of all this material it's like
when you're a kid I don't know if you
guys were born in the 90s but I was born
in the 90s and I used to wear shirts
like this all the time like it's just
nostalgia for me at least and it's off
the shoulder that sleeves are tight and
long because they go out to bell sleeves
it's not very cropped I just thought
this was beautiful the color is a nice
light blue excuse me and so with these
two tops what I was thinking is the
white one with some really nice jean
shorts and then some kind of gladiator
sandals and then this I thought would be
really cute with some flowing white
shorts and then shoes like this which I
was just about to talk about they're
from Windsor and they're so cute they're
just little thong sandals but they have
these gems on them so it makes it a lot
fancier looking but they're still
comfortable to walk around in which is
awesome so I could definitely see myself
wearing these in Greece and I really
liked them so I thought those outfits
would be really cute together and then
this is another off the shoulder top
although it looks just like I don't know
it literally looks like the weirdest
thing ever but it goes off the shoulders
I honestly don't know how to explain
this it's like a crop top off the
shoulder crop top thing and it's flowy
and I really like the stripes and I
thought this would be really cute with
either jean shorts or with some flowy
white shorts and then sneakers I thought
that would be really cute I mean it
would look nice with sandals too
definitely like converse or something to
kind of make the outfit a little bit
more how do I explain like casual versus
something fancy I am bringing a pair of
white converse with me so that's gonna
be good then this top oh that's also
from Windsor there's no size on it but
it's probably a medium this one is also
in a medium but I feel like I should
have gotten a size small because it's
made pretty big so if you guys are gonna
get this top get like you're true to
size type of thing but it's so beautiful
it's off the shoulder but it has this
beautiful detailing over here kind of
looks like a doily and then it laces
down the front the actual material
itself is so lightweight and beautiful
it's cropped this is gonna be so nice
with like dark jean shorts and sandals I
mean this would be cute like as an
all-white outfit as
but I think the jean shorts that's more
my style and then would this like a big
hat that I'll show you guys later it's
gonna be so cute and because it's
Crofton off the shoulder it's gonna be
very hot and greased so that's still it
still covers up but at the same time it
doesn't make you look sweat Windsor is
usually my go-to it's not sponsored but
Windsor is usually my go-to when it
comes to traveling because their stuff
is affordable but it's pretty good
quality and they usually have like super
trendy cute pieces then something I'm
super excited for is my maid of honor
told me well I have two maid of honors
one is my sister one is my best friend
Katherine and they told me that they
planned something for me during one of
the nights in Mykonos and I have to wear
all white I don't know what we're doing
I don't know what they have planned they
just told me I have to bring an
all-white outfit and I'm assuming
because I'm gonna be the bride so they
want me no white I don't know what's
going on but I'm so excited and by the
time this video goes up I'm sure you
guys will know if you're following me on
any kind of social media which you
definitely should links will always be
down below but I'm gonna be posting like
all the time when I'm away and so I'm
bringing this romper I got this actually
last year from princess Polly but they
have similar rompers and I love it it's
actually off the shoulder so it would
look more like this and it's flowy all
white has some really pretty detailing
in the front and I really like off the
shoulder tops because I just find them
flattering on me I like to show off my
broad shoulders like I really like the
fact that I have brought her on top I
like the fact that I was an athlete like
I'm really confident in my own skin and
I just really love the way this like
looks on me so I'm going to this is
something that let me know well actually
by the time you let me know I'll already
be away but I really like to bring tops
like this that I could wear over bikinis
looks like a dress shirt but I thought
it would be so cute over a bikini if
we're like going to a beach or something
I have my bikini on with my high-waisted
shorts and then this thrown over I
thought it looks cute and they have
really beautiful beaches in Mykonos
supposedly I don't know I've never been
but that's what people tell me
and then another throw over is something
like this oh the other one by the way
it's from princess Polly and it's a size
12 I think I got like the biggest size
and then this is from Windsor and this
is a size large
and it's a very thin lightweight
see-through kind of shear that's
see-through but yes your blue kimono
type thing again so cute over a bikini
or even just like thrown over a tank top
with some shorts would be really nice
and I love the fact that it's really
lightweight so I'm not gonna sweat too
much but I still fit you know windy or
whatever it covers up then I got this
skirt from szabo skirt and I don't know
what's I oh it's a size small it's a
full length maxi skirt but I love the
detail of it there's polka dots there's
these beautiful yellow flowers it's a
maxi dress at the bottom there's dots
and it's kind of hard to show but if you
guys follow me on instagram which I
think you should because I post all my
output pictures there I'm definitely
posting like in every single one of
these outfits because I'm packing very
strict to the day because we're gone for
so long so I need to make sure that I'm
gonna wear everything you can see what
it looks like on me in the Instagram
pictures and by the time this video goes
up a lot of those pictures are gonna be
up already so make sure you're following
me on instagram it's just my name also
let me know what your Instagram is down
in the comments so that I can like go
stalk you guys because it's one of my
favorite things to do is just to like
randomly stalk you and like your
pictures and so if you are following me
on instagram already comment it down
below so I can go stalk you can't be
private though because then I can't see
your pictures but two other tops from
sad let's go skirt this is a size medium
it's so cute
off the shoulder crop top there's a
zipper in the back that you zip closed
and then this has a bit of an opening
but it's not like exposing it's really
nice and the detail is really pretty and
you can see here then the reason why I'm
not doing a trial and Hall for this
because I usually always do try on hauls
as you guys know and it kind of
frustrates me when people don't do try
on hauls but I really really want you
guys to go look at my pictures on
Instagram because with a new algorithm
and everything going on it's been such a
struggle for me to get my work out there
for you guys for those of you who even
already follow me so I just want to make
sure that like things are going well and
they're still working so I don't know
photography such a passion of mine and I
just really want you guys to go over
there and see what the outfits look like
in their environment of Greece because
it's gonna be so beautiful and I'm so
excited about it I just I want you guys
to go check out the picture
really bad next top this one okay this
one I'm not sure of because when it's
really cute right like this is so cute
when you look at it but then on when I
tie this the bow is like sticks out like
so far and it makes my boobs like so
like this and so it's not like the most
flattering thing I also don't like to be
super boobie but we'll see maybe oh I'll
try it out and take a picture just so
you guys could see and like post it on
my story or something and be like or
maybe it'll work maybe someone will show
me how to wear it properly
who knows but it's from Sabu skirt size
medium oh my gosh this is so pretty and
this is so greased to me it's a very
long maxi dress it's this beautiful
material and it's a little open in the
back goes down a little low and then it
ties and it's by the brand spell and the
gypsy spell on the gypsy designs I
believe I got it off of shop ah I'm so
excited to wear this it's pretty
lightweight it's not hard to pack it
looks cute it'll be good to wear I have
two bathing suits to show you the first
one being this bikini top that is from
for love and lemons how pretty is this
so I didn't get a bottom because for one
the top is expensive and I have so many
white bottoms so I was just gonna wear
it with my own white bottoms but I love
the lace detail I love the bows on top
it's so cute and it looks really good on
me I got this in a size medium and it
fits pretty well and then I got a
one-piece guys this just reminds me of
the bathing suit in Mamma Mia if you
guys have seen that movie it's all ABBA
songs I love it and one of the bathing
suits that the main actress wears is
like a blue bathing so it's not white
but it's a glue and white kind of and
she's there in Greece and so this
reminds me of it so much the back goes
down a little low it's a full coverage
bikini
I know bikini swimsuit but it's still so
flattering and so cute there are some
cups in here so it does hold your
boobies in okay then I have three fun
things to show you guys which I'm it's
so excited for for this trip first one
being this I got a little headband from
Windsor saying bride-to-be so I'm
probably gonna wear this out during the
night they have planned for me but
also I want to take this picture with
all my girls so I got everyone matching
bathing suits that look like this that
says I do Cru and it's sparkly pink lo
on the back it's actually super sexy on
they're all gonna wear that and then I
got this one and it says I do how cute
is this I cannot wait for you guys to
see this picture it's gonna be so cute
I'm really excited so that is all for
clothing that I'm going to quickly show
you some accessories and jewelry that
I'm bringing so the first thing I'm
gonna obviously bring my necklaces from
my jewellery line looming holla that I
did with stillness I always have a link
listed down below but it's the jewelry
that I designed it comes in yellow gold
a white gold silver and rose gold
there's chokers and then there's this
piece I love it so much so I'm
definitely gonna be bringing these I
wear them every single day in the shower
when I work out like I just never take
them off so that's definitely a peace of
mind and then I'm going to be bringing I
saw these earrings from princess Polly
and I never wear bigger earrings and I
thought it would be really fun for you
know one of the days or a night that I
go out another funny thing is this
glasses chain that you wear around your
sunglasses that like well tie here and
then they just hang I don't even know
how to explain it but this is like such
a grandpa thing kind of but I really
like it so I got that and then as I was
saying earlier would that outfit with a
hat
this is the Hat that I'm gonna bring
it's from lack of color like this and
then ask for a bag I'm bringing this
from princess Polly it's a belt bag aka
fanny pack if you're from the 90s I
definitely had a bunch of these as well
as my mom so that is it that is
everything that I am bringing with me
for my Bachelorette week in Mykonos
Mykonos don't know how to say it but I
am so incredibly excited make sure
you're following me on Instagram to keep
up to date with everything that we're
doing because I'm gonna be posting so
much while I'm there as well as in Spain

all I don't think you're being weird and

like hang and talk and like I don't know
grab a coffee or something so I love you

I'm so happy and excited and please
