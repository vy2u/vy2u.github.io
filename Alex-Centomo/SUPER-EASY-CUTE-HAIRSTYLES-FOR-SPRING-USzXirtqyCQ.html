channel today I am collaborating with
sexy hair to bring you three different
styled looks which are perfect for
spring and I get questions about my hair
all the time so these looks are kind of
gonna be my go-to looks if you watch my
vlogs if you are following me on any
form of social media this is always how
I'm going to be doing my hair I think
it's perfect for anyone very simple
really pretty and really healthy-looking
I always feel really confident when I
have really nice hair and I get a lot of
compliments about my hair when I go out
public and stuff and the healthy sexy
hair line it definitely helps me achieve
the confidence that I want in my hair
and I just love the way it looks if you
guys are new to my channel make sure to
hit that subscribe button down below and
also turn on the notifications and give
this video a thumbs up if you guys are
excited for spring and for summer I
cannot wait for warmer weather so if
you're curious to see how I create
really nice hairstyles for spring and
that you can follow along then keep on
watching ok so as you can see my hair is
just a little damp right now I got out
of the shower to my makeup and I would
say it's like sixty percent dry right
now so I'm going to start off with the
first product which is the healthy sexy
hair so you want it all this is a
leave-in treatment so I'm just going to
apply this to my damp hair this actually
offers 22 different benefits to the hair
including detangling which is what I
need because my hair is so knotted when
I get out of the shower and you guys
could see how easy it is to comb through
the hair when I use this product it
smells so good I just go in small
strokes like this so I don't break the
hairs I've very fine hair so it
detangles it smoothes moisturizes
nourishes soothes strengthens color
protection the list goes on and on I
always make sure to do this once I get
out of a shower because it helps keep my
hair so healthy so because of the way
the bottle is - since it is a spray type
thing like and it can it actually allows
you to use every last drop of
product and it's lightweight which is
nice when styling your hair plus it
helps protect your hair because I'm
about to blow dry it so making sure all
the strands are coated which is why
combing out your hair really helps not
just with the knots but distributing the
product properly throughout your hair
also the new revamped healthy sexy hair
line was reformulated with mimosa flower
extract which helps add moisture to
promote holistic health and wellness
from the inside out which is really
awesome I just like it because they're
giving it TLC which is tender loving
care to the mind body and spirit okay
now I need to blow-dry the rest of this
while my hair smells so freaking good so
once your hair is bono dried you're just
going to take a regular curling wand and
start curling your hair now I've done
this so many times but I'm gonna teach
you a little trick that I've been doing
recently to get your hair done a lot
quicker
so I use a curling wand that is just
like one and a quarter inch so I split
my hair into and I start from the back
and this is a very loose curls tutorial
so I curl every strand of hair away from
the face I take chunks around this size
and when I curl it around I also twist
the hair with my hand so it's not flat
against the barrel if that makes sense
it's kind of more twisted and then I let
it fall into my hand for a split second
and then you got a loose wave and I
always leave a little piece of hair kind
of straight
so half the head is already done don't
worry guys we're going to be combing out
this I'm just going to let it cool down
a little bit so that I don't get rid of
the curl and then I'm gonna do the exact
same thing on the other side making sure
I'm curling away from my face so I'm
going to start off gently and combing
out the side that has been cooling off
longer so taking a wide comb starting
from the bottom and loosely combing it
out it ends up looking so beautiful if
you want to add a little flower crown or
little tiny flowers here or even pull
your hair back a tad that would be so
pretty but I love the way this looks
onto hairstyle number two all you'll
need are some tiny clear elastics the
first thing I'm going to do is take the
top section of my head but not that top
half I would say probably from the top
of your eyebrow grab the section and do
the same on this side and you're going
to attach that behind in this tiny pony
just together as if you were doing an
actual pony tail once that's secured I'm
going to pull it tight but then take the
pieces here and pull these out a tad so
that it looks looser around your head
but you still have the hair pulled back
and then I'm going to take little pieces
that are on the bottom part of your hair
and I'm gonna braid them all the way
down I have been seeing this all over
the place
runway social media and they actually
add just a little bit of an edge to your
typical hairstyle because they're not so
obvious pulling out the braid just a
little bit you don't want it to be too
big to see how it's just like hidden in
here you can even do them smaller and
you can do them all over but still
having the curl looks really nice and
then I'm going to finish off this look
with the healthy sexy hair love oil this
makes my hair
so soft and so smooth the scent of it is
so nice it gets rid of any frizz that
you might have adds so much shine to
your hair it's really lightweight and I
like to apply just honestly I don't put
it into my roots but I add just a tiny
bit to get rid of any flyaways that
might have happened during the
blow-drying and I like that it's
lightweight too so it doesn't weigh your
hair down at all the curls still look
really nice and I'll also add a little
bit into the braids like this whatever
is leftover on my fingers as well as the
little back of the pony over here and
also what's really cool is the packaging
itself
I don't you guys could see it here look
how nice this is
so this was actually in collaboration
with an artist who's known for his
bleeding-heart murals and that's why it
looks like that his name is James gold
crown now onto the third hairstyle
obviously the curls are kind of coming
out because I've been playing with them
we are going to be adding in my favorite
product of all time this is the healthy
sexy hair Surfrider texture spray it's a
dry texture spray and it actually makes
your hair like a beach bombshell it's so
nice it's really lightweight and it
gives you so much texture and dimension
to your hair it's perfect for braiding
so I mean just having it in curls itself
is really nice just want to play with
your hair a little bit add in the
texture it's like a perfectly imperfect
style you can also reapply it as much as
you want because it is super lightweight
so it doesn't hold your hair down just
nice what I'm gonna be doing are two
fishtail braids
it also adds a lot of fullness to the
hairstyle so I hope you guys enjoy this
video if you did make sure to give it a
thumbs up and also check out the link
down below so you can get all the
products that I mentioned in this video
as well as in the new sexy hair line so
I'll have that above the fold in my
description and also let me know which
look was your favorite I think for me
it's probably just the curls with a bit
of texture spray in them it just feels
so messy and like perfect and bouncy and
light and will go with so many spring
outfits so I cannot wait to rock this
look and also make sure to check out
sexy hair TVs YouTube channel to see
more how to's I'll have it linked down

an amazing day or night wherever you

much and I'll see you all in my next

amusement part we come to life when it
turns dark
