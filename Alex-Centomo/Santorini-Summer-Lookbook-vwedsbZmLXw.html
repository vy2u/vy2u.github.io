decided to come to Greece for our
three-year anniversary which is pretty
crazy and we're staying at the San
Antonio Hotel in Santorini which is
honestly like a dream hotel it is
beautiful by far the nicest most
luxurious hotel I've ever seen in my
entire life it's in between Peeta and
iya
so it's like perfect like quiet location
it's in like on the edge of the volcano
it's kind of like in its own little cave
it's so cool with an infinity pool that
goes off the cliff it's just like a
dream every time I walk around at the
hotel I'm just like if you guys couldn't
tell by the intro which obviously you
can I decide to come a lookbook when I
was here because I got so many questions
from you guys asking what you would wear
on vacation or what you think are like
the cool things to wear when you're in
Greece because I know that especially
with Santorini it's such like a
well-known beautiful area of the world
and I love the fashion that goes with it
and I was very inspired by the Greek um
like fashion and stuff so hopefully you
can get some inspiration from it and use
it obviously you don't have to wear the
stuff only if you're going to Greece I'm
definitely gonna be wearing these
outfits back home in Montreal and other
places where I'm traveling this summer
