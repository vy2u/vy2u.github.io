fall and I'm so incredibly excited
follows my favorite season I feel like
every youtubers favorite season is fall
because it's like so trendy but actually
my favorite season is fall where I live
it does get quite cold so it's real
sweater weather which I love so much by
September a little October same old
thing that I say every month but
literally like time flies because of all
the cold weather I know I don't know why
I'm smiling I just love the fact that I
can wear sweaters outside and I'm not
dying of heat so the two sweaters I've
been loving the most in September have
been this one which literally looks like
a blanket oh this is a cardigan that i
got from for love and lemons and it's
literally the biggest sweater and the
entire world it's very oversized very
shaggy coughs like a shaggy dog it's
like a thick blanket basically when
you're cold here's the throw it on and
you feel like you bring a blanket but
you're not because it's actually a
cardigan and it goes pretty low like it
covers my butt and stuff so I wear it
mainly with like a really thin white
t-shirt and leggings and it's so comfy
oh my gosh guys combat boots love this
look the next has been something a bit
more different so this is a cropped
sweater so it looks like this it's just
a crew neck but it's cropped really
thick thick not thick really wide
sleeves is what I want to say it's from
brandy and it says New York on it um I
obsessed with new york city lately i
wouldn't so live there so I normally
roll up the sleeves so it looks more
like this when you're when you're on
that kind of like push them up so that
they go to around here and the really
baggy and stuff and then I wear it with
high-waisted jeans and just booties and
it's so cute even with a really floppy
hat if you guys follow me on instagram
which you should you will know that I've
been obsessed with this hat from brandy
melville it's just a simple baseball cap
but that has your brand new really
awesome because they're really like
flimsy so they're not too structured and
they fit your head really well and there
not to like baseball cap I have a
baseball cap that says me work on it
it's like the Yankee cap but these caps
for some reason are just way more
comfortable and this green color is
awesome it's like a faded
muted grayish green color I know I
really really like it and I think it
looks awesome on I wear it this way I
don't want to ruin my hair though I'm
not gonna turn on oh my god I just
realized i never took the tag off i
literally been wearing it this whole
time with the tag on how is that not
irritated my head I've had up just for
like a month anyways it's fourteen
dollars if you guys are curious love it
I have two pairs of shoes now that I
really want to talk about these ones i'm
pretty sure if shown before I don't know
if I've shown them in a favorite but
they're definitely been in lookbook
video there are these booties I've got
them on shopbop.com Schaub Ofcom is like
an amazing website because they
delivered literally in a day like their
express shipping is the best thing ever
but their stuff is so expensive so I was
really saving up for these boots for a
long time and they're actually kind of
like a birthday present to myself
because I just really wanted them they
were kind of expensive they're from
freebird by steven is the brand and
they're just booties I wore them at
Coachella they have a bit of a heel with
their chunky and they're just
rugged-looking and I've been wearing
these a ton in September I love wearing
booties and they go with literally
everything because they're so rugged you
can wear them with black jeans blue
jeans literally anything I wore them all
in Peru and I get so many compliments on
them when I do wear them feel like a
Swedish material and there's a zipper on
the inside and they're a bit more wide
here so they make your legs look very
long and thin and I do have very long
legs so I just find they're really
flattering over all and they're really
good quality that's the one thing I know
about free bird is that their quality is
incredible then the next pair of shoes I
really want to talk about are these ones
these are just simple white sneakers but
they're like more cream like an
off-white but they're from lacoste and I
actually did not buy these Katherine if
you guys know my really good friend cat
Bell she wants a little cost show at new
york fashion week and she actually got
me these as a gift so thank you so much
to Catherine for these but they're so
nice and I've been wearing them a ton
since I was in New York they're very
comfortable really sturdy and I kind of
like the like creamish off-white color i
think you know i have really really
white
but now I have like these pairs and it
just goes with everything so I think
it's really cute I wore these a lot with
just like simple leggings and the
cropped sweater that i showed before I
just thought it looked really good
together I just have an obsession with
like shoes especially for the full time
like booties oh my gosh you guys get
ready for some booties so the next thing
I want to talk about is actually a
fragrance and this is from jo Malone and
it's called the wild fig and cassis
cassis I don't know how to pronounce it
I got this last year when i went to new
york city around Christmastime and it's
been like my winter scent and i just
realized that it's actually a cologne so
this is for men and i wear it but it
smells amazing and i think i just i'm
attracted to like manly sense cuz you
know when like a guy walks by and they
smell really good you're just like you
know so i think that's a reason why i
liked it so much it kind of smells a bit
like pine like pine needles a bit I
don't know how else to explain it oh it
smells so good and actually one of my
guy friends has this scent so he wears
it and in New York City when I met up
with him I was like okay we literally
have the same perfume cologne great Alex
good job but now I smell like him so
it's great and I really like the scent
if you're curious because obviously you
can't smell through the screen you guys
could check it out maybe there's a
description online i'll leave a link to
the perfume in the description so you
guys could see if maybe they have like
exactly what smells like because I'm so
bad at describing sense the only beauty
product I have to talk about this month
is um this mascara it's the roller lash
by benefit I've showed it many times
before but I kind of picked it up again
in New York City and oh my gosh I forgot
how much this stuff is amazing so it's
very dirty my cat because I literally
bring this everywhere with me now it's a
really really simple brush its kind of
curved I don't know if you guys will be
able
probably not but um this with the third
one I've used the third bottle of it and
it just works really really well so it
doesn't add like a crazy amount of
volume but it adds a lot of length and I
kind of do use two coats which then adds
volume so it's perfect and I really like
it I have a problem with mascara
smudging on me because I think I have
smaller eyes like things just naturally
smudge really easily on me this does not
smudge like I wore will wear this on a
flight like a long-haul flight and it
will not budge and I'll be sleeping and
moving around and stuff but it takes
like two seconds to take off when you
wash in your face because it's not
waterproof so I really really like this
stuff the next thing I want to talk
about is kind of random but it is this
cookbook that I got for my birthday from
my aunt I'm Sophia's mom and so I think
it was from Sophia as well I don't
remember exactly sorry sews what this
thing is amazing so if you guys don't
know I actually suck at cooking and I
hate cooking because I'm so bad at it
Daniel loves to cook and he's really
good but I wanted like a cookbook that
was healthy simple recipes so this is
called plenty more it's just a bunch of
really really really healthy recipes
like salads and stuff there's some vegan
stuff in here too um it's just like
really really good and I find having a
cookbook just helps a ton when it comes
to cooking so this is a good starter for
me because if you guys don't know I've
been really trying to eat healthy oh my
gosh just how good does that look guys
like seriously so I've been really
trying to eat healthy and this is a
perfect thing I've already made like a
few recipes from here and there's
something that I have bookmarked that I
want to cook with my aunt and it's like
this salad that has like all this
amazing stuff in it oh my gosh oh look
at this to make me hungry if you guys
want to see like videos of me like using
this cookbook let me know they're not
sponsoring this video by the way guys I
just really would like to really work on
this and maybe I can make videos out of
it let me know and then the last thing I
want to talk about is my subscription
