channel I'm on my vlogging camera today
because I actually have some exciting
things to talk about for one I'm gonna
be vlogging a lot more on this channel
because I feel like you guys don't
really get to see much of my life and
much of me and my full-on personality
and stuff and what I get up to things
I'm doing and things have been just just
so confusing because I have a vlogging
channel which a lot of you guys do know
about it but a lot of you might not and
then I also have a couples vlogging
channel with Dan that was like we tried
to do daily we did all of 2016 but
basically it was just getting so
confusing so I think what I'm gonna do
is just start vlogging more on this
channel incorporating a lot more fun
things so I can get out a lot more
content but a lot better content things
that are just more me and more
personable and I just think you guys
would like appreciate a lot more and
then focus on like daily vlogs with
Daniel and for like everything else so
the first thing I'm doing for my first
main vlog on this channel is talking
about my wedding so we are looking into
wedding venues we're actually at one
white right now and I'm sorry that my
face looks kind of crazy I just had a
treatment done on my skin so it's like
super flaky and gross and like I'm sorry
I put it offends and you see like flakes
flying off my face but I mean I don't
care personally we are looking into
wedding venues because a lot of people
have asked us what our date is what
we're thinking of and you can't have a
date without having a venue so finally
we had time to make appointments come
and look around and yeah I'm really
excited about it so let me take you guys
on the journey so we're looking at a
bunch of different places we're going to
four different ones today but we don't
have appointments cuz we didn't know if
we have to make them or not Dan called
and they said come anytime but now
there's like a saying that says do not
enter it's cute this one this is the
first one we've been maybe there's a
wedding going on that's it though it's
like this little thing and then behind
is like a small River there's a small
gazebo back there okay so that woman was
a biatch so scrap this place she was so
rude we're at our second location
there's a cute little doggy in there I
was
patent before you so cute there's horses
and stuff yeah there's horses down there
I don't think I don't you guys could see
how cute cool yeah super rustic I like
it a lot actually Twilight got married
in a forest yeah I like all the trees
and stuff the cabins
that's so cute yeah this is somewhere
you could do a ceremony maybe they're
doing one soon
this place is so nice
we're riding in a horse-drawn wagon guys
that's what's gonna happen it's so
beautiful here oh my goodness
welcome to this little maybe we should
go to the path you guys know the path is
there I see it I really have to
concentrate on where I'm going because
knowing me I will fall and I will hurt
myself really bad see this is the path
pretty I love the forest show me I could
have sworn I saw that on the website
look that actually looks like the front
the well that's the thing is the exact
same as the one they hate it's just it
put in a different place no I don't
think it is because behind it is like
stuff oh yeah okay so let me see that
picture like this is in the for yeah
it's like it's almost well that's what
I'm saying we can always ask them to
like put it somewhere with a path and I
would be down to married in the forest
yeah
I'm just gonna say how it's crazy to me
like the other place the woman was so
rude in this place they're so nice this
guy this guy was literally just a server
yes like like I know like a waiter and
he was so nice and friendly and he
stayed with us for you know ten minutes
answering all our questions
yeah it's currently us all this stuff he
answered so many questions are so nice
this place can actually accommodate like
60 guests to sleep so if we like we have
friends coming from
and stuff there's like cabins here then
they have a big lumberjack cabin where
you could fit like 60 people so that
would place would be more like if
someone was a you know too drunk to
drive home because this place isn't too
far from like where my whole family
lives so that's not an issue but for
people that are coming in from out of
town that don't have a place to stay and
like that's the one thing I was
concerned about is like where would we
find a hotel close by because it's very
rustic it's very in the middle of
nowhere well not in the middle of
nowhere but you guys know what I mean I
was nervous about that but that's
perfect there's like beautiful cabin
like super rustic super comfy really
nice and I don't know it's just so
pretty here I like it a lot there's this
like cabin over there so this is the
lumberjack place right this is where
they lock you up this is nice
he's like rock formations and stuff this
is mainly just for people to like sleep
in and it's like it's like a three
minute walk from where the reception
would be yeah I want to go back to the
main place you feel more well that's the
path that goes all the way back to the
garden yeah of course I decide to wear
these shoes today from princess Polly
but they're amazingly comfortable and so
fashionable but they are hard to walk in
this terrain with because I keep hitting
dirt and rocks in them
there are kittens here no so cute they
were really cute so guys what do you
think about this place I love this place
I liked it as soon as I saw the doggy
and the horses as I expected topless
they'll see all the other places go get
it
there's the kitten oh so cute
it's so cute guys oh all you scared
little baby he I don't know he's gonna
come out yeah I can see his like
whiskers
they're so cute oh my god
oh yeah there's the big one in the
rafters it's like yo get away from my
kid oh my goodness he came out do you
see that guys he's so small oh my
goodness
don't be scared
you
we have these signs here in Montreal at
Tom co-ed knows how fast they put that
slowly but devoutly meaning like watch
off your children it could be your own
and there's a dead kid the kid got hit
by a car make sure that is so morbid on
our way to number two I mean number
three because the first time we went to
the girl was rude and didn't let us see
anything this next one I don't know it
snow bears which I don't know what that
word is in English but that is the word
in French and we're going to we want a
very rustic wedding that's why we were
looking at this for those of you asking
questions we are not getting married in
a church so there's no need to find a
place of the church next by it we're
just getting married outside and having
the ceremony like dinner part inside
cute there's water down there
I liked how the other one was more
rustic listen still really pretty though
water in the background few people are
playing frisbee over there
that's pretty don't you guys could see
over there but there's horsies Oh cute
there's a church outside and stuff then
there's one of the holes is here
it's not my style okay so we're going to
the fourth place now but we just found
out that we actually can't walk around
they're like really strict that you
can't look at the venue unless you book
indeed but it's like why would I book a
date if I don't know what yeah you know
like they have a video on their website
and stuff but it's like I'd rather walk
around and see before I booked a date
with you and put it in positive so we're
just gonna drive by and but what we
really want is outdoors rustic we want
to make sure that if it does rain
there's like a there's an alternate
option like a plan B and then also place
two steps really right sorry there's a
place to stay for people that are coming
from out of town so so far the second
place we visited had everything we liked
the only downside in my opinion Dan and
my mom didn't see there's palm with it
and there probably isn't it's just me
but I didn't like that like you have to
go with the food that they serve they're
like you can't cater your own stuff I
know but it's like I was like oh there's
gonna be vegans and vegetarians there
and he said they can do it but you know
sometimes at places that like to
specialize in meat because they had
that's what they do
anyways I'm just saying that was the
only downside which is not even a
downside to like a wedding venue you
know what I mean so he said they do they
would do vegan and vegetarian often now
the next place is an hour know that's
what the ferry oh that's
well we're about 25 30 minutes from the
farrier and now and then we got to take
the ferry and then we're gonna drive
another ten minutes after the ferry so
it's fine this is the place that cat
Belle's dad got married at oh is it very
actually is a car and we're going into
another location which is like off the
islands we have to cross the water and
I've actually never taking this ferry
before but we're like if they just close
the back we're with all these cars and
we're gonna go over the water by the way
my mom is with us - you're so cute
we're moving are we
and this is what our $10 bill used to
look like now we got new ones but
so what used to look like and it's
plastic and on the 20s if you scratch
the maple leaf it smells like maple
syrup so pretty the Canadians like
I didn't even notice we are moving
this is a really good shortcut to go up
north
yeah I bypassed the highways
we should do that
that's what my sister does
yeah anyways can't really see much but
we're at the third I mean the fourth
spot now but we're not really allowed to
be here well it hasn't said no nothing
yet it's working
maybe they're having a wedding so it's a
vineyard it's really
it is nice I guess this is oh we need
caps like it is I think overlooks a
cliff this is probably the old barn
that's been checked is they have an
indoor reception area yeah this is apple
orchards now yeah so we're coming around
yeah this is where a kaeleen crams
friend got married
there's a vineyard
my goodness yeah full of September every
single day Wow
what about October lodging with the
changing leaves
pretty yeah it's a really nice look out
dang this one's really nice and like
just behind us is like the reception
place can you overlook this but there's
like no cars or go on it's like pouring
ya know if your whole reception can be
there yeah it's nice it's a nice place I
just like the vineyard and I don't know
if you guys will see it oh yeah they
have bathrooms they're up there that's
like with a backup plane oh sorry that's
where they would do the ceremony backup
ceremony over there that's really pretty
and then it's a cliff on the other side
that shows you the view I just showed so
this one isn't as rustic as the other
one but it's still really beautiful and
like the vibe that we both like where
it's like outdoorsy and really nature
but I do have to say I love the fact the
other ones in a forest yeah but this one
would be beautiful in the fall
this one is more book so I'll have to
call them again and we'll have to see
what their availability is my mom had a
good idea she said just a book around
8:00
why did almost all places that I asked
said when if someone cancels right or
changes their date and you're on a
waiting list then you can just take that
right you know like if you want
September but there's nothing available
but it's hard to do that because you
need to organize everything for a
specific date right looking flowers like
all that it's not let you see
contentiously are
it's pretty yeah it's it's different
it's a lot different it's really pretty
and then we found three other places
that we're gonna go a different day and
they're on like the east end so we did
everything in the West and then we're
gonna go to the East because there's a
few like rustic barns and wow that's so
pretty
yeah well the leaves are changing colors
it's gonna be so beautiful
that's why I really want to get married
in the fall because I just think it's so
pretty so there is another place a few
other places that dad found that we're
gonna go a different day but this gives
us a good sense of like what things look
like it's tough and gives us a good idea
of things we can look out for questions
we can we can ask for the other places
that we go to but this is so exciting
guys it's finally starting to like it's
not
the main things that we're looking out
for for our wedding like I said earlier
make sure there's a backup in case it
rains because it's gonna be all outside
look the ceremony and stuff option to it
no option to second rule that we're
looking at is make sure that there's
places for people to stay they're coming
from out of town like we don't know if
this place that we just saw has that and
the third was the third one again I
don't know just make sure that we both
like the place that we're both on the
same page when it comes to that because
I feel like I've talked to a lot of
couples and all the times the men feel
like they get kind of pushed aside and
the options and stuff because usually
like a wedding
no girls a young girl you always like
dream of your wedding day and stuff so a
lot of times like if the man cares about
that kind of stuff some don't even care
but like Dad for example really cares so
we're making sure that we both agree on
everything and we like everything
similar today's though yeah we really
like the same things like everything
that he's talks about him like yes yes
yes yes yes
as much as it in my head I was like we
have to go with your catering thing but
it makes a lot easier you don't have to
like worry about finding something but
whatever in the end I don't care I just
want to bury I love my life
Wow we're meant to be my mom and my dad
got married their wedding was like a
different kind of wedding that we're
having they got married then that's a
damn Church in the old Port of Montreal
like the back the chapel which is really
really beautiful and then they had their
reception at the Ritz - it's just like
so fancy it's so beautiful and I'm just
like yeah ours is gonna be nothing like
that ours is gonna be Ana for art is
gonna be different but we're gonna love
it just as much and a different way for
this kind of stuff but you guys would
have everyone got married in churches
and did like banquet holes and a bank
exactly was either hotel
but also I feel like you and Dad didn't
really have a decision like he was kind
of like oh this is where you're gonna
get married and your parents like when
Grandma and Grandpa were like oh you're
gonna have your reception at the hall
because they paid for it so they they
had they used to go there all the time
they used to go every Friday for for
dinner there so they knew they knew
everybody yeah I mean it's beautiful
like that when they sit when they off
they didn't say you're gonna have it
there but they had offered they said
would you like to have your wedding at
the Ritz
you know would be on us so for those of
you that haven't been like watching my
vlogs in the past or anything when it
comes to my wedding just or even like
the wedding video down and I had made
just as an update we are having a very
like family based so basically everyone
in our wedding party is like family and
really really close friends my cousin is
marrying us my friend is making my
wedding dress like it's very known what
the word would be not yeah it's very
intimate so that's one thing that I'm
really excited for
you're so beautiful
okay yeah so much fun
look I'm a captain with my captain's hat
my hair just one of my mouth isn't that
a conductors hat not a captain's hat
we should get back in oh so much fun we
are trying to figure out another day to
go see the rest of the venue's I think
we're probably do it on another weekend
I'm really happy with how that went so
something I want to talk to you guys
about I feel like it's kind of random
that I had this like back-to-school
series and all of a sudden I'm talking
about my wedding and everyone's probably
gonna be so confused but I'm really
trying to switch up my channel like I
was just getting into this rut of like
filming the same things first every
season and like the same types of videos
and it was just getting to be all the
same as much as I loved filming those
videos and I probably will still do some
it's not gonna like completely I'm never
gonna do those videos again I just think
that it was getting to be too repetitive
and I film so many things and like I
have so many ideas of stuff that I want
to do and I just don't put it out on
this channel because I just felt like if
I did in the past like it wouldn't like
go over well and it just it was a little
discouraging but I was talking to my
managers and they told me that I should
never feel discouraged and I 100% agree
because that's the advice I always give
you guys is to never feel discouraged
and I just want to get out of this rut
and I want to be putting out all the
content that I love and I know you guys
will enjoy anyways and I mean if you
don't obviously doesn't really hurt my
feelings because stuff I love and the
stuff that makes me happy but I do want
to help you guys out too so going back
to filming two videos a week I know I
said that last time and then I didn't
post the video during the week but it's
because I literally felt like I was in a
rut all week because I was stressed
because I was like oh my gosh like I
have to come out with all these types of
videos and I just don't feel like
comfortable with them anymore or not
comfortable but I just felt like I'm
happy with them so now I'm going back to
the content that I love I'm gonna be
excited to start posting more videos for
you guys I really want to incorporate
more of like the whole health and
nutrition thing that I've been doing in
my life I haven't posted many
those about that but I feel like I could
really help not only just physical
fitness but mental Fitness will like
mental health and all that kind of stuff
and a lot more cooking videos what I ate
today a lot more artistic videos a lot
more about the wedding a lot more about
my life still gonna do the hall still
gonna do fashion because I'm very
passionate about it but you're gonna see
a bit of a change with my Instagram
account to morning going through a
little bit of a change but I do think
change is good and I do want to be like
showing you guys what's going on my life
and and having you guys realize like I'm
mostly most of the time I think older
than most people think and a lot of
people still think I'm like early
college or something and like I've been
done school for years now so that is
just the little rent and it's over and I
hope you guys enjoyed this video if you
did give it a thumbs up let me know down
below in the comments what stuff you
want to see because obviously I still
want to keep your suggestions in mind
and I still want to help you guys out
it's just gonna be a little different
than normal
and I'm really excited about it by the
way just so you know I'm gonna post in
the description where my outfit was from
then I'm gonna do a lot of questions and
yeah other guys so much don't forget to
subscribe and see you guys on Wednesday
