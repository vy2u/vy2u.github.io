sister Kyla and we actually I have been
getting a lot of requests lately to do a
style swap with Kyla which is basically
like oh it's a sister swap so she does
my makeup the way that she would
normally do her makeup and then vice
versa so I did her makeup the way I
would normally do my makeup and then
like hair outfit etc like that and I
thought it would be a really fun idea
because we have completely different
styles basically I'm just gonna be using
my brushes for her face and like my
mascara and stuff just because we don't
like sharing those products but we have
it the same like everything else is like
pretty on right so you'll see yourself
so if you're interested in seeing this
video just keep on watching yeah I'm
using that primer by Annabelle
our foundation we basically use the
exact same foundation but like we have
different shades so she just me use mine
on being darker - yeah yours is darker
we have the same brush - like foundation
brush
so you like rub it in yeah
next I'm gonna use my Urban Decay
eyeshadow primer potion this prevents
your eyes from creasing when you put on
eyeshadow so then when I am done with
the eyeshadow primer I like to move onto
my Mac Pro Longwear concealer this thing
is so annoying because you need like the
tiniest little amount and it's like
I shadow I like dark eyeshadows
sometimes this is the naked 2 palette
and this is makeup that I would wear if
I was like going out
okay look at me
that's really pretty I'm really bad at
doing other people's mascaras too
good I only switch up what I use on my
brows so I'm just gonna use me what is
this the benefit brow kit okay
I used to use this stuff all the time
and then I started using the Gimme brow
and I loved that and AD stays yeah yeah
me too I started using bacon I started
using the Gimme brow and I have an
associate for anesthesia how do you guys
pronounce it anesthesia Anastacio cuz
like the movie Anastasia yeah I said
yeah me too but like everyone YouTube's
it out of stars yeah Adam I play
Anastacio I'm like it's anesthesia so do
you always contour yeah always benefit
hoola bronzer blush I use it looks like
a bronzer but it's not what colors it's
by Mac in sweet as cocoa
I'm using my Rimmel stay matte pressed
powder you put this on after everything
yeah
it's not like the browser well I like to
blend it in a lot to go everyone you did
that on me
you just took like the center oh did it
get in your mouth yeah sorry
yesterday my sister and dinner was like
laughing it's your turn with it it
tastes so bad oh this is Mac patisserie
why hello I want to and it's the luster
pretty the fat my going-out look I like
the very like bronzy shiny look and then
I'm just gonna add a little bit of my
Smashbox lip gloss
so you would normally leave your hair
natural would you put it up or anything
or just leave it down leave it down I
would just like if anything out a bit of
hairspray to make it more like textured
and like volumous but I mean like your
hair looks good like this oh I get a lot
of compliments when I leave my hair
natural so yeah awesome yeah I like the
way you do my makeup it's really nice
yeah yeah I like never wear my makeup
like this so it's so weird so the first
thing I like to use is primer I've been
a huge fan of the Smashbox photo finish
foundation primer which is the pore
minimizing one its oil free and it just
minimizes your pores so I put like a
little dollop on my hand and I just rub
it into your face I don't want to like
rub it in I just kind of press it into
her skin okay I just put it in like her
t-zone area basically take my Beauty
Blender with the NARS sheer glow
foundation we both use the exact same
one like I said before and then I just
dab it into my skin normally I don't put
it everywhere everywhere I put it in the
places that need coverage like my cheeks
and stuff
and I've never used a few beauties I
love it
so do you feel like make it like yeah I
always make sure to blend down the neck
guys the less foundation you use the
butter and you can always blend it out
and add more on to other sections rather
than just like putting heat on your face
and it's just like looks like you have
cake on your face basically when I use
concealer I use the instant age rewind
by Maybelline just good friend your eye
concealer brightens it up so I always
move on to brows next that's like my
next thing that I do I really I'm kind
of following her natural brow shape and
I really don't like a crazy amount cuz
then I go in I brush them out I find
bright shiny brush them up towards your
hair and out is the best
then recently I have been loving instead
of using an eyebrow I shadow primer I
use just this like I tattoo and it's by
Maybelline and it's called barely
branded it's just a barely branded I
think I mix the caps but it's just the
pale light one and I put it all over the
lid it just gives you like a very
natural Sheen and it works pretty well
as a primer so you can even just leave
this as like on its own this is perfect
for like when you're on the run and like
you don't have much time to get ready
you just throw it on your eyelids and it
looks like it took time to do eyeshadow
I forget the name of it but I'll link it
down below it's by Mac I use it all the
time I really I kind of just add this to
the outer corner and crease and then
just sweep it on like the majority of
the lid it just gives you like a really
nice subtle look
I do a little bit under the eyes it
doesn't give much color but it gives a
sheen so in certain lights you move and
it shines I just find it looks really
pretty I do like a subtle subtle subtle
wing yeah that's perfect
okay now the struggle is trying to get
them both equal never it's so nice I'm
gonna I'm gonna mess up the other side I
put like a dot in the middle of her
eyelid I don't even want to look in the
mirror guy is like this is a mega fail
when this happened just act this
actually happens a lot to me so this is
what I do when this happens close your
eyes I take a small brush and I smudge
it in the lashline to give it a natural
wave or not wait the natural wing and it
looks so nice a bit of this color called
print it's like a dark gray this is
trend from a natural look to smokey look
probably uses this one I'm gonna use
hers because she doesn't like sharing
mascaras what is the Colossus volume
Express
I haven't been contouring I've actually
been using this it's the rocket or blush
by benefit and I just sweep a little bit
on the apples of my cheeks and bring it
up towards my temples then I take my Mac
this is the mineralized skinfinish in
soft and gentle it's my favorite and I
just use a big fluffy brush for this
sweep it along the apples of the cheeks
down the bridge of my nose under my
eyebrows just a subtle frame and then
for lips lately I have been loving to
put this Revlon lip butter thing
and then for hair I've just been loving
to do just a simple fishtail braid so
bring all your hair to the side simple
fishtail braids so split into two take a
section from one side and bring it over
to the other and then you just continue
doing this and I like to mix up my
sections I do small pieces and big
pieces normally I wait for my hair to be
dry to do this but I'll adjust got how
the showers oh okay then when I get near
the end of the fishtail I grab a section
and I just like pull out pieces
I love big chunky messy fish goes like
there's nothing I hate more than like a
tight braid
that's the finished makeup look so now
we move on to the outfits because we
have completely different styles I find
like yeah like so different she's more
classy I'm more like grungy I think more
hipster I'm the kind of person that
likes to dress in all black all the time
so I just have Kyla in my favorite
outfit that I find for this winter I
just love it you can't go wrong with
wearing all-black it's my favorite thing
ever and then just my classic simple
makeup I just find brings the whole look
together
so this sweater is just a simple
turtleneck sweater that I got from made
well in New York City it just says bon
voyage on it I love it it's just black
and amazing these ripped jeans are from
brandy melville and they're super
comfortable I absolutely love them and
these are my new favorite booties from
Sam Edelman his circus collection I love
them and I get so many compliments when
I wear them I love this outfit it just
screams Alex as for my outfit Kyla likes
to keep it very kind of classy and
casual so she loves pairing anything
with heels these are her favorite heels
from daily look I believe I think
they're from Chinese Laundry this
sweater dress is from Windsor the
leggings are just simple from Lululemon
and I don't know I find this whole local
ties everything together so hope you
