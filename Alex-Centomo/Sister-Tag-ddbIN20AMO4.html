Kyla I'm sure you're them sure you're
all excited to see her because I get so
many questions for her to be my videos
and I finally convinced her to being one
so I figured the best way to the best
way to I guess introduce her would be to
do the sister tag because I see this
going around YouTube a lot and I figured
it'd be fine and yeah excited yeah I'm
really excited
awesome so there's just a bunch of
questions that we'll answer so you can
get to know it's better let's see by the
way this top is from fresh tops it's so
cool honestly their stuff is awesome
look I'll link them down below go check
them out because it's great question
number one describe each other in one
word I go first
yeah uh thoughtful what you're
thoughtful because I'm jaded myself no
you think of other it's like you don't
you don't think of yourself first all
the time you put others first before you
you're always trying to help other
people out and you just I don't know you
just care about how other people feel
okay I would say that you're probably
you probably have the biggest heart out
of anyone I know and I know that's not
like one word but I just don't know how
to explain that like big heart that
sounds weird but you care a lot about
you care about a lot of people and I
just feel like you have so much love in
your heart to give our own I don't know
cuz it's hard to describe somebody in
one word because I feel like there's
like a bunch of words yeah like you're
intelligent and kind and sweet but I
think like the bigger picture is that
you just have a big heart thank you
thank you do people ever get you mixed
up all the time really like nice island
whenever someone used I remember when I
was younger and our aunts or uncles used
to call the house oh yeah yeah but
they'd be like hi Alex right every
little time I'd say no this is Kyla oh
yeah or they think we're our mom we're
yeah even weirder because she really
doesn't sound like guys oh my god I
don't find my sound the same I know I
finally hear myself in videos I have
like I feel like I have a madly mind you
know the manly voice but like I find
when I talk like I kind of like the way
I pronounce my S is is very like yeah a
you loo announce my a like so like I'm
so pretty watch everyone to come to me
you sound so much alike I know what
annoys you about one another your face
okay I think okay yeah when we were
younger we used to steal each other's
clothes all the time yeah and so we got
locks on our doors so he wouldn't steal
each other's clothes but we still slowly
toys clothes oh the time so like that
doesn't really happen anymore so I guess
but that would have been like the one
thing I think yeah now I think it's just
like if like one of us is PMSing let me
just get on each other's nerves cuz it's
like it's like World War three yeah
that's like you know you're PMSing so
you're just mad at everything but like
at the same time like it's still
frustrated yeah having a sister as a
guru okay like a youtuber yeah like how
do you feel about that uh I think it's
pretty cool I mean obviously you'd be
like really cool if you became like
super famous I'd be like that's myself
oh my god Kyla but like no I find it
really cool like I like watching your
videos it's helpful and also like it's
helpful that you know a lot about like
fashion and makeup and like so funny
like when I first started my sister was
like what are you doing because she
would like I used to be like in my room
like doing homework or something and
then I would just hit my sister like
talking to herself so be like oh maybe
she's like with her boyfriend or
something and then like you come out of
your room and be like oh can you keep it
down a bit
I'm filming a video like what just
actually talking about myself didn't let
me do you ever argue no never
we're perfect yeah kidding when was it
we're arguing like yesterday about the
stupidest thing we are you
it's like the biggest deal ever but like
after it's done you're like Kay that was
like those really stupid and then like
good and then my sister will come up to
me and be like oh what's your opinion on
this like literally like two minutes
later yeah I'm like everything's fine
and I think what the biggest thing we
argue on it's like if we ask for advice
from each other and then like we don't
like the advice that's given so we get
bad yeah here's like but it's like will
you ask yeah like what we do that best
thing about one another I would say that
you're probably like my best friend
Oh like we really get along yeah we
argue sometimes but like we really do I
can't like do that cuz my hat um yeah I
definitely say the same thing like I
really like I never want to live with
anyone but my sister it's funny cuz we
fight but at the same time we get along
and we just we have the same humor so we
get each other I don't know how to
explain it like we're definitely glad
member that time that when Ryan signed
and we were like playing that prank on
you oh my god boyfriend is a hockey
player and he's probably gonna go to
British Columbia next year hopefully not
gonna live but yeah so he wants me to go
with him so we're you decided to play a
prank on my sister one day and tell her
that we were both leaving together and
like the next week and my sister
literally like started crying and like
had to leave her family no boys at a
restaurant yeah you have to let leave
the restaurant first I was so upset
because okay yeah I get it she might
move and like live with this guy who I
hate right now because like oh my god
he's stealing my sister for me Ryan no
but I don't hate you but um I just like
she was like oh yeah he signed like he's
leaving I'm on Oh weddin he's like next
week pilots coming with me like what oh
my god favorite memory together we have
like the best childhood my parents were
awesome yeah I think like any memory of
us with the old house in the backyard
that's what I'm thinking and I'm also
thinking it's remember like every
holiday like used to wake up and you'd
be so excited for like Santa like to
have come the night before and I was
always like crap me in the morning and
like never once we have but like I show
her you're always so excited that it put
me
in a good mood like I was never the type
of kid that was like oh my god santa
came last night I have to wake up like
Santa still comes you know collection of
teeth actually member we went to Florida
together in the cruise oh yeah we went
on this cruise I like there's these
people following us one night remember
those two guys yeah and I remember
you're like well my luck I like cake on
the kind of thing we're just gonna run
away I'm you're like walking with them
in a hallway I like in the cruise ship
I'm like my sister just like she's like
1 2 3 we both just like take off
everybody in there like look yes heels
or flats flats um depends for what I
guess yeah like I don't know I would
probably say heels right off the bat
because I'm obsessed with heroes like I
have yes but I wear flats way more often
than I'm going to get more comfy yeah
comedy-horror chick flicks ready or
sometimes my sister will text me during
the day and she'll I do you want to
watch a scary movie today and even if
it's like the dumbest scary movie ever
like we'll just got junk food stay and
watch scary movies we're obsessed with
horror movies I don't know I think it
started like you guys remember are you
afraid of the dark and goosebumps like
when you're kids like I remember the one
I think it was goosebumps and it was
like with a pool and there was like a
dead person that was buried under the
pool oh yeah he's like famous now that
guy Jay Baruchel yeah well it wasn't him
that died he was just the kid back are
drowned but no okay I was like obsessed
with that show growing up both those
shows and then I don't know like I
started watching all these horror movies
when I was little and I just really
liked it and then she was always really
scared but I would make her watch it
with me to the point where like she
really liked it and so then we became
like I'm possessed with horror movies
and remember the first scary movie like
official scary movie that you made me
watch was the ring oh I know is during
the summer and I remember you used to
like you get mad at me if like I would
close my eyes if you get so mad at me
because I feel like and my boyfriend
says the same thing if you're gonna like
watch a scary movie
like just try and keep your eyes open
try to get the whole experience of it
because when you close your eyes it just
like waste I don't know like yeah I
think you to the whole experience what
is your favorite makeup brand um I don't
know a lot of makeup brands but I like
Mac I like Sephora it's not a makeup
friend
what does they have their own like
makeup forever for like NARS
I like NARS yeah nervous is good I'm
really liking Tarte lately what's that
tart it's you have one of their blushes
oh yeah yeah that's really nice I really
liked her lately but I mean I've gone
through phases like I've been a Mac
obsessive person I own so much mac
makeup makeup forever I went through a
phase where like everything I bought was
makeup forever and then NARS same thing
with narns I bought a few things from
Chanel but it's just really pricey and I
just like I don't know I go through it
so quickly that I'm just like yeah it's
like really expensive and it's like
really small if you can go anywhere in
the world together where would it be and
why Australia oh my god yeah Australia I
have an obsession with Australia ever
since I went I just loved it and I think
that it's like the best place cuz we're
from Canada and I feel like Australia's
very much like Canada - like the cold
weather yeah I'm like the sexy accent oh
yeah but everyone is so nice there when
I went I was really surprised at how
everyone even the bus drivers they're
just so nice like such cool people and
like I love surfing and I just think
that like I love the fashion there I
love the weather there I love the people
there I just want to live in Australia I
would like to go there with you because
you'd probably just make me like
obsessed with that obsessed with it yeah
favorite inside joke I don't know if
it's like an inside joke but I feel like
we like really find it funny when like
someone Falls and like their legs are
when like there's like let's say we're
watching a movie and it's like a funny
movie and like everyone in the theatre
starts dying laughter at this one scene
and like me my sister be like the only
two but like don't really find it funny
and then they'll like film some random
person like laughing out of nowhere and
like we'll both look at each other and
just start dying of laughter because I'm
so random but like it's not supposed to
be funny
we violate the weirdest
funny sometimes like my boyfriend will
say a joke and we're just like hey
and then sometimes I'll say something
like normal and it'll find it so funny
and he's like laughing cuz he's like
wait wait and then sometimes things
happen and like I laugh and all everyone
just looks at me like I'm crazy and I'm
like there's my sister like no one gets
me stuff is like a sin my friend stuff
yeah oh my god she's so we have like
weird humor I don't explain it I think
what I think we're freakin hilarious I
don't even know if you remember this cuz

trying to like sing to the mom cuz like
he wants to get her attention he's like
singing Britney Spears one more time oh
yeah I bet these legs on the table no no
no like nothing boy another son like
Michael Murray just died for so long I
think we rounded a lot but I know it's
like this such as he's so funny
we died it takes longer to get ready you
think so yeah okay I take really long oh
my god I feel so bad for Ryan well it
takes a good guy two seconds to get
ready oh my god no but I remember
there's one time I was going out and
like I literally made him wait like
almost two hours and then me and my
friend Nicole decided like at the very
end that we just didn't feel like going
anymore my god so the poor guy was like
they're sitting waiting for us and then
we're like oh we don't wanna go anymore
with the girl what are your pet peeves
I guess about each other or just in
general I don't know how many pet peeves
that you do like oh my god I came five
years ago I'd say Kyla had this weird
habit of like knocking her knuckles oh
my god that was so bad she it was so she
just like needed to knock her knuckles
enough feels like that was like a face I
think it was like OCD like I had this
weird like superstition that like if I
didn't and it was just on wood so like
if I didn't knock on wood like let's say
I would say something about like a test
that I had like I did oh my god I'm so
superstitious that I had to find wood
and knock on it right away
they're like anything I said that like I
was superstitious about I'd have to
knock on wood but like you would knock
so loud and like for so long it was like
it was like one of those things that
like you would knock with one hand in
the other and it'd be like I would just
be there like knocking and I feel like I
have this weird thing and like a bunch
my boyfriend so much like I have this
weird thing that like if like I hurt
myself on one side like I have to like
hurt myself on the other side of it and
I know equally been like if I break my
arm I'm not gonna break my other arm but
like if I like like if someone scratches
me or something backs it like all like
have to go in like kind of scratch me I
don't people like that yeah
I'm ever in grade eight this is like
before I really knew it OCD was I know
Cedeno said this girl in a circle during
dance class and she like hit her dropped
her hat on the floor and so she went
down to start hitting her and then she
hit the other hand shewhart's at shed to
hit the other hand so she was just like
hitting her hands on the floor like
non-stop and I'm ever lucky I really
what are you doing what are your
greatest fears sharks I'm throwing up I

has a fear of almond um I think my
greatest fear would probably be like
losing someone I loved cuz like yeah who
wants that kind of question is that

losing someone I loved or like the ocean
