many requests on Instagram lately to do
more hunting the the to do more hair
tutorials and I always forget to do hair
tutorials just because I feel like for
so long I did them and I kind of was
just always doing the same things over
and over again so if you guys are
interested I'll leave like a little
playlist down below in the description
where you guys can check out all my old
hair tutorials like my main ones so like
loose curls Beach waves
um any like braids tutorials I might
redo them since I kind of switched it up
a bit it's up to you whatever you're
interested in when I posted this picture
on Instagram I asked you guys if you
want to see a hair tutorial for that
because it's quite different than what I
normally do and all of you said yes I
love doing that by the way on Instagram
just like asking guys questions and like
telling you to leave an emoji it's so
much fun you guys are I just didn't
follow me on Instagram I'll leave a link
down below right here basically this
tutorial literally takes 5 minutes it's
like the fastest thing ever you guys
know me you know I don't use heat a lot
but on there are days where I do want to
use heat like I do want to curl my hair
or in a brush or you know I have an
event to do and I just want my hair to
look extra snazzy but you know take no
time to do it because let's be honest
I'm lazy there are minimal products that
you need the first thing you need is a
hairbrush if you have tangly hair if you
have naturally smooth beautiful hair I
hate you basically this is a really
disgusting and dirty hairbrush
that's embarrassing this one is just
from forever21 super cheap then this is
the Tresemme heat protectant spray this
is the one that would says keratin
smooth I don't know it was on sale
that's why I bought it I don't know if
it does anything different from the
other one they kind of work the same in
my opinion and then the other thing that
is optional for this would be some hair
texturising spray this one is by Amica
you guys know I love a Mika but there
are some from Buffalo and bumble that
are really good and honestly those are
my two favorite I tested out a bunch of
texturizing spray or creams but if you
have any suggestions leave them down
below love to check that out the last
thing and the most important thing would
be just a curling wand and you can use
any curling wand you like this is just a
I think this is a one inch or one and a
half inch curling wand I believe it's
one and a half inch because it's a bit
bigger than the 1 inch and then the last
thing this is completely optional but
you guys know I love me some extensions
and I suggest you to put your extensions
in and then curl your hair with the
extensions in just that way it looks
more natural but I just did my hair the
other day and as you all know if you've
watched my extensions video that I don't
wash my extensions that often says it's
not good and they still have the curls
in them so I'm not gonna redo it but I
mean if you do your if you curl your
extensions beforehand it still looks
good once you blend it all in it's fine
I have like medium length hair like it
goes past my boobs but I add the
extensions to give it a bit more length
and volume and all that stuff and it's
just fun especially if you're going to
event awesome anyways I'm rambling like
I always do I know I know I know I know
let's just get into it so I have really
really knotted hair so I just like to
brush my hair out when my hair is damn I
use a wide tooth comb but I've been told
and correct me if I'm wrong
know this but when you have dry hair you
should use a detangler or a brush to get
out the knots and when your hair is wet
you should use a wide tooth comb I think
that just prevents breaking I'm not too
sure but be gentle with brushing your
hair so once you have pretty much
brushed through your hair I just use my
heat protection spray and this just
ensures that you're not damaging too
much of your hair I like to also just
brush through my hair to distribute it
evenly oh my gosh guys and then the next
thing that I do this is like the most
simple thing ever but I literally split
my hair I mean you could do whatever
kind of part you want I'm just kind of
doing this for now I split my hair into
then I grab a section oh and I okay this
is kind of weird to explain but I will
take the arm that has the curling and
put it over my head and then wrap this
around like that I leave it for around
10 seconds and then I let it drop into
my hand
I think that a little bouncy curl and I
just throw back and a trick that I do
that I've always kind of I set us in
like every hair tutorial before I switch
directions so sometimes I'll go away
from my face and sometimes I go towards
and then also sometimes I make sure that
the hair is lying flat on the barrel
like you see here and sometimes I twist
the hair as I'm twisting around you'll
see in a sec what I mean by that and I
always leave a little strand not being
curled like this if you can see like I
don't curl the whole strap so it's more
like straight on the ends here I'm going
to do opposite direction now you'll see
I'm just kind of like twisting the piece
as I'm twisting it around the barrel and
this just kind of ensures that every
single piece is a bit different none of
them are uniform and it doesn't look
like Shirley Temple hair also for
section wise I take around this size a
bit bigger a bit small every section is
different the reason why I do that is
because like I said before you don't
you're opposed to being uniform and when
you do it this way it just looks more
natural it looks more like you have like
I don't know beachy hair especially when
you put the texture spray in it it just
looks really nice it looks more messy
and you guys know me oh no you know I
love messy hair that's just like my
thing I love when hair just looks really
messy
why I make sure to never curl from the
top of my head meaning like I'll never
curl from the roots
I'll always start around quarter or half
way down like I'll never go from up here
I'll always go from like here so when I
get close to my face I just make sure to
do all the pieces going away from my
face that way it looks more windblown
it's like my biggest pet peeve when
girls do curls towards their face I
don't know why I just find it really not
flattering and it really bothers me but
again it's up to you so as you could see
this side is completely done I know it
looks a little crazy now but don't worry
because we're gonna fix all of that up
in a second I'm so over winter guys I'm
so jealous of you but live in such a
nice hot climate because it's still
snowing where I live like I'm looking
out the window right now and it's a
blizzard
it's literally a blizzard and it's the
middle of March and it's still gonna
snow into April where I live I'm just so
excited if you guys didn't know I'm
going to Florida on tomorrow Thursday so
if you're interested in seeing what I'm
getting up to in Florida be sure to
follow both of my Instagram accounts
because I'll be posting on both one's
more Tumblr E and like artsy and it's
like my personal account and then one is
more like fashion related you can go
check them out if you're interested also
on my vlogging channel I will be
vlogging the whole trip I'm super
excited I'm doing a shoot when I'm there
so it's gonna be so fun that's honestly
all I'm getting up to what do you guys
up to what it like are you traveling
anywhere soon are you in school working
what do you have to appear
No okay another thing that I will do is
you see how like there's some curly
pieces here I'll literally just go like
this with my curling wand to straighten
them out now that that's all done and it
kind of looks like a little bit of a
mess I mean it's all up to you but I
like to it shake it out I'll flip my
hair let me give it a good toss all my
fingers break up the curls a little now
if you have naturally very straight hair
and you find that the curls don't hold
well in your hair I would probably skip
this step or you're really really going
crazy with your fingers I maybe slowly
go through with your fingers but use
hairspray
um I personally don't need hairspray
because my hair naturally keeps the curl
really well so like I can actually have
these curls for days and not have to use
hairspray I guess I'm lucky that way but
if you feel like you need hairspray
now's the time to apply some so it's
just gonna look like this and honestly
you can leave it like this if you want I
think it looks great but if you want to
add in the extensions to make it look
more like that picture that's what I'm
going to do now so the first thing I do
I do this like super quick I'm so messy
when it comes to putting in my
extensions I do not do them like
perfectly I grab all my hair in a
ponytail except for it literally the
smallest little section in the back then
I put the smallest like a shortest clip
yes these don't match my roots but I
have ombre hair and they match my ends
so that's why and I'll just clip it in
the back it's literally a clip so you
clip it in look like this let my hair
down and then I just do section by
section I'll never go up above my ears
though like I'll keep it down below so
that you don't see the clips popping out
anywhere if you're curious as to which
extensions I'm using these are by foxy
locks I tagged them in like every single
Instagram post if you want to check out
their Instagram account
um but these are the 24 inch sandy
blonde extensions and that's the color
of my of my ends not my roots obviously
my roots are just my roots it's my
natural hair color I love these
extensions I find their leg this is not
sponsored by the way guys hike they just
work really well with my hair they don't
annoy my head I can wear them for a long
time and not be annoyed they're super
soft and they're thick at the ends which
is really great because I had old
extensions that were like thin at the
ends and it just looked gross this is
what it looks like
I could go up now obviously I would fix
this so the curls kind of match but for
the purpose of this video I mean you
guys can pretty much tell what I'm
trying to do yeah and the last thing I
would do is just to add in some texture
spray so I honestly mainly put this for
the smell because it smells so good
and then you can put your hair parted
any way you want you can add volume if
you want um I love volume but I don't
feel like teasing my hair right now so
I'm not going to add any volume but
another trick would be just to blow-dry
your hair when it's like 80% dry if you
get out of the shower and you just blow
dry it upside down that'll give you a
lot of volume
it's these pieces here that always like
piss me off but I always have to like go
over because I have like little dents
but I think this hairstyle looks awesome
I love it with the extensions I just
think it makes it look so full I wish my
real hair look like this but anyways if
you guys did enjoy this video make sure
you give it a big thumbs up let's try to
get it to 4000 thumbs up that would be
pretty awesome I never usually ask you
guys in my videos to click the thumbs up
button at certain amount of times if you
guys want to share the video and tell
them to thumbs it up that would be
awesome because it just makes me really
happy and I like trying to like get new
