everyone so I am super excited as you
can probably tell by me screaming at you
but Spring has finally sprung and the
weather is beautiful it's like the
perfect sweater weather I would say and
I've been getting for like the past
month and a half requests from you guys
to do a fashion spring essentials kind
of video and I know this is huge going
here on YouTube right now but I couldn't
do it before because it was literally
still snowing up until like a week ago
where I live so finally the weather is
beautiful and I have been like rocking
all of my favorite spring items and I
know a lot of you guys spring clothing
is different from where you're from so
I'm just gonna kind of show you what I
like because I feel like my style is
kind of different from like what people
usually dress like in the spring like
I'm not huge into florals or pastels
there are certain trends like I'm
obsessed with so the first place I want
to talk about is Nasty Gal
if you have been following me for since
the beginning of YouTube or know me at
all in any personal way you know that
I'm a huge fan of Nasty Gal I've been
shopping there for years I just love the
whole kind of selection they have on
their website is very different like you
can find stuff it's very affordable you
can find stuff that's pricy it's kind of
like up to you and their styles are
awesome and I'm pretty sure you guys
love them too
but basically their spring line has been
on point I'm just like the past month
literally been on that website I got set
for Coachella feel like I saw everyone
rockin Nasty Gal
when I was at Coachella like so many
people it was just like I love their
stuff so I actually picked up a few
things and they kind of go with the
theme of what I am shopping for so the
first I guess trend for me or spring
would have to be any sort of ripped up
denim so I'm a fan of this like all the
time but with spring especially
that have rips and they're baggy or like
my thing so the first item I have for
you here are these pair of jeans they're
light washed denim so they look like
this it's pretty true to color actually
and there they sit low on your hip baggy
with like crazy rips in them like this
and then I just rolled them at the ends
and so that just oh no I got lipstick on
it so you can show your ankles if you
roll them and I love these so much
especially with booties and like a crop
top and a jacket it just like my
favorites kind of thing ever
honestly like Nasty Gal it just has my
style because you guys know me you know
I love I have a bohemian side but I also
have kind of like an edgy kind of side
not super edgy but like I don't know how
to explain it but literally like nasty
al has it all they're just very like
fashion forward and like free woman kind
of style it just I really like it and if
you also didn't know what I think is
really cool is that the website actually
has vintage items and new items so if
you want to get stuff that's actually
vintage you can as well as just a newer
items too
the next thing I got is this just
literally came in the mail denim jackets
are a huge thing for me in the
springtime because it's just like the
perfect in-between jacket like you can
get away wearing a jean jacket and not
being it too hot or too cold it's just
like perfect so this one is my new
favorite it's super oversized like this
and there's little studs on like all the
details of the front of the jacket if
you guys can see all the little studs
yeah it's awesome so this one's just
like a dark darker wash medium I'd
super oversized distressed at certain
points and what's really cool about this
is the back there's like a big rip
I'm interrupts in denim I know like the
older generation is like why do you
guess that you could just like make a
hole yourself but you know it I don't
know how to make holes like this I'm
sorry I have tried to distress my jeans
and I just I don't do it right so I I
just whatever I buy it
and then that to complete the look that
because I want to get a whole outfit on
masta go I got my new favorite booties
you guys know I'm a huge fan of booties
and beauties beauty's booties for me in
the spring are like a necessity on you
will not see me wearing anything other
than booties so what I got from Nasty
Gal are these ones look how beautiful
these are I've already worn them a ton
so they kind of have like dirt on the
bottom so I'm trying not to like get
everything dirty but I love this it's
such a beautiful color
it's a suede kind of material like I
just really like it and they fit my feet
perfectly I'm a size seven and they fit
true to size and I don't know they're
beautiful they're also really
comfortable I know a lot of people
wonder like if you wear booties a lot if
they you know hurt your feet after a
while I personally don't find they do
some of them do like if the heels really
high but because this is a super chunky
heel like this it makes so that it's
very very comfortable to walk in and I
like the little detail over here it's a
cutout on the heel it's super cool so
love those if you're interested in
seeing these items I'll leave a link it
down below also leave a comment telling
me what you're shopping for to complete
your spring fashion kind of thing
because I'm super curious
Sippi I'm super curious because I know a
lot of people have like different styles
for spring and stuff I know my style
might not be everyone's but it's very
like laid back casual
okay me in so yeah let me know what
you're shopping for and if you like any
of these items another big thing for me
would have to be long sleeves so because
in Montreal where I live some days it
could like go up to let's say 18 degrees
Celsius but then like in the mornings
and the afternoons or in the mornings in
the evenings it can get a little chilly
so I find like a long-sleeved t-shirt
underneath a jean jacket is perfect so
ones that are very lightweight like this
one here this one is super long it's
very very thin material and it's so soft
I'm obsessed with this it's like the
most simple long-sleeve t-shirt you
could find but I love it it's from daily
look and it smells good because I just
washed it but even see this would like
this bra light sticking out with looks
super cute because it's very whitewashed
it kind of looks white on camera but
it's I swear it's a light gray color and
it's just very very simple but I like
that and then if you don't want
something that's too simple like that I
say stripes or huge for me so I got this
one from H&amp;amp;M it's just simple
long-sleeve t-shirt but it's striped
kind of a bigger neckline and on the
shoulder right here there's like three
buttons and actually it reminds me
something that you can get from Free
People because I know they have
something very similar but this was I
think 20 bucks or 15 bucks from H&amp;amp;M I
love this this is actually my
boyfriend's favorite top that I wear I
don't know why it's like his favorite
thing ever
every time we going dates it's like can
you wear that stripy shirt like
so random another thing I would have to
say are cropped tees I know this is also
like a summer thing but Croft tees with
high waisted jeans and a denim jacket
like I showed before are awesome so this
is my favorite one it's from brandy
melville it's short it's just very
simple it's gray I have a thing for gray
the next thing would have to be kimonos
I like long kimonos right now especially
for the spring if you guys have watched
my Coachella lookbook you will recognize
this because I brought it to Coachella
with me but it's this one right here so
this is from revolve clothing but it's
by the brand spell and the Gypsy designs
I love this brand just really really
nice colors have like a really nice
design to it if you're interested in
seeing how this looks on me you could
check out my Instagram I show all
outfits on my Instagram loved this
kimono but any kind of kamon you guys
like I think is huge for spring and
summer but especially spring because you
want something to throw on when you're
kind of a little chilly for the last two
essentials I would have to say our hair
accessories and sunglasses those are
like a huge thing for me so these two
sunglasses are I think my favorite right
now just because I literally came back
from LA and I got these when I was there
they're from Windsor they look like this
the first pair are heart-shaped if you
guys can see I love them and then these
ones are like a knockoff version of the
REA bad ones which I actually own but I
like these because of the book the lens
I don't know it's like a really cool
color you guys
so I love these they're just super
simple and then for hair accessories
I've been loving at these two pieces
from three people so the first one is
this like clipping hair piece that has
three different strands and you actually
braid a piece of hair around it and I
wore this at Coachella a lot of people
were asking me in my in my pictures at
my blog what it was but it's basically
just this then you clip it underneath a
piece of hair it's just like a little
clip and then you braid the rest of it
with your hair so it looks like this
really cool material in your hair I
think it's really awesome so I like it
it's just like a blue and purple color
with some gold beading and then they
have little tassels at the end which are
really cool as well and then the last
thing is this headband so I wore this at
Coachella of course I'm just saying all
this stuff because it's like it's what I
wear so I actually wore this the other
day with a leather jacket and I thought
it was like super cool I had my hair in
like a really high messy ponytail with
this thing wrapped around and sunglasses
and a leather jacket and dad said I
looked really cool so obviously I looked
really cool if he's at home just kidding
so you can basically make it tight or
you can wear it bigger if you want to
have it wrapped around a lot of your
head I love the purple color and I love
the design they have a lot of different
colors online but I purple is my
favorite so I got purple and that is it
for my spring essentials of fashion wise
if you guys would like to see a spring
kind of workout video if you want to see
spring treats or food ideas like healthy
food ideas I'm super into that if you
guys are interested I think spring is
one of my favorite seasons
it's just a happy season like everyone's
happy cuz the snow is melting and the
weather is getting warmer and the
flowers are blooming and it smells
really nice outside especially where I'm
from because that smell of snow going
away is like the greatest thing and
seeing the grass for the first time your
life finally also quickly I want to talk
about something because I recently
started an online shop on eBay I asked
you guys on Twitter and Instagram if you
would be interested in purchasing some
of my clothes because I've been doing
some spring cleaning and I realized that
I have no room for clothing I am just
sometimes I get clothes and I wear them
once for a video or for a picture and I
never wear it again so I'm like well I'm
kind of just hoarding it because I'm
like maybe I'll need it one day and then
I just never wear it all of you were
super interested in that I will leave a
link down below to my eBay Shop some
stuff I have up for bid that's like very
new and some stuff I have just for sale
which is a little bit older but it's
still like brand-new condition
everything's perfect and on the stuff
that you could bid a portion of it goes
to charity of your choice so whoever
wins
you could choose whatever charity you
want and I'll donate the money to that
charity also if we can get this video to
4,000 thumbs up in 24 hours that would
be awesome you guys did it for me last
time on I asked and I was like wait what
