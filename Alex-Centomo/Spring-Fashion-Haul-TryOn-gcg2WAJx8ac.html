channel I decided today to film a spring
collective no it's not collective
because this is stuff that whole just
recently got it it's a spring that try
on haul I asked you guys on Instagram
which video you'd like to see first the
spring try on haul or spring outs of the
week and the majority of you guys voted
for this video so I think I'm going to
do this one first and then an outside of
the leaked video and then I have a few
other really fun things planned but if
you have any suggestions obviously feel
free to leave them down below in the
comments because I love doing videos
that you guys like me to do anyway so
might as well just get right into it
with this brandy melville you guys know
I've been a brandy girl for a very long
time I've loved their stuff ever since
they opened a store here in Montreal and
2013 you guys know I works there so I
just I love their stuff this is the only
thing that I like actually go into store
to get everything else we buy online
it's also funny that I'm filming a
spring Tron haul right now because it's
currently -16 and snowing a lot outside
but that's just Canada for you or
Montreal okay first thing we got is this
cute little key I love these types of
little ribs cheese especially with the
little what is it public ruching ruffles
whatever on the trim it just reminds me
something I wore when I was in grade
five back in a David it's so cute it's
really stretchy so like this looks
really small but it actually looks
really cute on and this is cute with any
kind of high waisted thing so high
waisted jeans denim jacket or like that
might be too much down so like high
waisted leggings with denim jacket then
I got this shirt but I'm not sure how I
love the fit on me I just wanna be super
cute over Algar under overall like
dungarees so it's a simple white cropped
tee but I like the detail on the
shoulder there's a little rose and I
just added something a little bit
different but ever than that simple
plain white tape can't go wrong by the
way I brandy is one size so there's no
point of me mentioning sizes and I'll
have links for everything looks down
below if you want to check them out I
also sometimes brandy has different
things online purses in the store
have to find the exact pieces but if I
can't find exact I'll just like link to
something similar oh then this is
something that I got from brandy
recently it's just a lilac splash it
looks more blue on camera but it's like
a violet a lilac color I was like waffle
kind of material and it's just like
loose long-sleeve oh I was cute I
thought looks cute with this hat then I
got two sweaters the first one is this
really cute light yellow color I thought
this color was so mean I love wearing
yellow yellow
I find looks really good my skin tone
looks nice with my eyes especially if I
have a bit of a 10 so a self 10 is
definitely needed for this I thought
this would be so cute with mom jeans
like the blue mom jeans and sneakers and
maybe a hat a photo so like my vibe and
then this is a similar cut but it's a
nice really muted green color and then
it has the bear from the California flag
on it and its really soft or comfy a
little oversized not too much it's
pretty like straight forward simple
greens I really like the color a lot and
I'm planning on bringing this when I go
to Vancouver on it too my next favorite
clothing store of all time princess
Polly you guys know from my last video
that I did two videos that I've shown my
stuff from people Polly it's an online
boutique I believe it's just online
I'm not hunter professor do not quote me
on that but I found it online and
they're Australian based but their stuff
is obsessed with it it's so cute so I
got went to stuff for one out of the
Bahamas and then I got stuff for my
Mexico trick that I'm going on soon as
well as Coachella and I'm just like so
excited so first thing I got was this so
this is a romper and it's actually
office not official there is a tube top
kind of style I mean you'll see when I
tried on but these are just the strings
to have it on the hanger but I actually
got this in mind for my outfit week's
video I think this would be so cute with
a sweater on top and then these just
peeking out we go really oversized grey
sweater I think it's like a perfect
winter to spring transition because it's
still a little chilly but you kind of
like
want to make it a bit more springy so
having something floral underneath a
sweater that you would normally wear in
the winter would be so cute with like
some really awesome booties this is in
the size medium then I got this top okay
this thing is awesome
this is a size 12 because I want to be
really baggy but it actually fits me
like really well and I think it's
because I just have really broad
shoulders so like storing my life but
basically this top is just a blouse it
has a bit of a bell sleeve but not much
I love at the pattern of it and this
actually ties when you tie it like this
around your waist and it just makes you
look like a genie I thought this would
be really cool on the coachella option
I'm still kind of figuring out what I
want to wear but it's so bohemian and
beautiful the pattern on it is stunning
so I love this oh then I got this pair
of short and these are high-waisted
black shorts that are like really wrists
up on the bottom part I thought it was
really cool these fit really nice zero
size medium which I don't know what that
is and like Jean sizes but typically I
wear a 526 then I got some bras so the
first one I'm not going to show it it
looks like on because it's literally a
feature and shows my nipples but I'll
like insert a picture of the model on
the website wearing it I didn't know
every let me see through okay or maybe I
did I don't know but it looks like this
it's a cute little bra let I have a
bunch of bra less from for low moments I
love for Logan lemons but their stuff is
like stiff and kind of like it hurts
this is the softest material ever it is
so comfortable it feels like your skin
you don't even feel like you're wearing
anything then I have this bralette and
this was really nice because it does
have that lining so it looks like skin
underneath but it's not it like it just
looks so pretty you guys will see and
the patter on it is stars moon and sun
which is so nice so I thought this
looked really pretty oh by the way this
size is a size 10 and I'm a 34c and that
fits really nice
and then this is a size medium so us
could see I like it's kind of hard in
your bra shopping online or bralette
bralette shopping Urban Outfitters I'm
typically depending on the bralette
either size small or medium so I just
kind of guess and it's worked out really
fine and then this is the next one and
this is in the size medium as well but
this one is friggin cool look at that so
it's a star and a moon on the boobies
and it has this really pretty kind of
like velvety material on top I don't
know I can't decide which one I want to
wear to Coachella I do know I'm going to
wear one of these with like a dress
shirt kind of open on top and
high-waisted shorts I'm just trying to
decide I'll probably bring both and just
like the side last-minute but they're so
cute so comfortable like literally most
comfortable bra less I've ever owned so
I got this choker that I'm wearing today
it's just like a simple silver one and
this one silver as well but it's thicker
so it looks like like this and literally
just got this in the mail like right now
it's a bikini top I ordered from summer
brand called Frankie so they sell this
on princess Polly I on that they were
sold out so then I went off the actual
website and purchase this one
I got identified because I wasn't sure
how the top was gonna fit and my friend
like is a seamstress so she got me 60
big oh my god so when I saw this was
totally under fit me ah look at this
color you guys mmm that is so pretty
okay I might be a little big but we
could always fix that it with this
mining even though I could fix that
honestly I guess I'll keep on the trend
of bikinis because I see this one right
here so this is a new purchase I got
from the brand
block of swimwear if you got it unaware
there is a local for me montreal-based
influencer who started her own bikini
line her name is Elizabeth Rio or if you
because you're French and if you're a
Frenchman yes she third home bikini line
and it's kind of the same materials
triangle like that neoprene but her
Sol's are really cute so I actually
ordered a black one but
looking kind of like a black leather and
the size didn't fit very well so I
exchanged it for a different color and I
thought this color is so pretty so this
is the bottom but I was planning on
wearing a bit higher up it's obviously
very cheeky this is not one to wear in
front of your family but it's more like
when I'm on a trip but I want to town on
my booty which is usually the case and
then the top is the best part how cute
is this
and this lilac color is so nice I know
she wears it like unzipped so give to a
lots of cleavage but I'm always paranoid
it's going to just on this so I won't do
that but there's no size me do this on a
size large and this is a size medium now
on it two wins there you guys know I oh
I forgot my shoes from princess Polly
guys look at these frickin booties I got
from Coachella how amazing are these the
only other five seven-and-a-half
available which is a little big but I
told myself live with socks would be
super comfy and look great I love them
they look exactly like the heel all she
in the Cloe boots but they're so much
cheaper than that but the quality is so
amazing it has a zipper on the inside so
like you can zip it up has a nice chunky
shield a little bit of a point in the
front this is like my exact favorite
style of booty goes up a little higher
on the ankle and has really nice details
of these buckles which oh I just like
this boot and it has a western-style
material here I just love it also for
princess Polly I will have a promo code
it listed down below where you can get
20% off your first order and then ask
for Windsor I got these booties which I
thought were really cool too for
Coachella they're a similar kind of
style both up high on the ankle the
zipper on the inside but they're like
this snake pattern obviously so it's not
real but I thought this would look so
cool and so funky
we'll see how comfy these are because I
as the feels a little strange but I mean
sometimes you got to suck it up for a
photo or two and then bring my sneakers
along and change to actually like enjoy
the rest of the concert and dance the
rest from Windsor this really cute tank
top I thought this would be awesome just
have like layered under a cardigan
perfect for like that in between winter
and springtime because it still has that
like
what our material is black you could
totally make it look really like springy
with a nice cardigan some light jeans
and sneakers and this is in the size
large but it's very stretchy also
realize if you're going out and trying
to resist partly cuz I'm Saul real place
can I just look back but I got easy
dungarees or overalls however you want
to pronounce them oh my goodness okay so
this is a size 8 they're just a light
wash and I thought this would be cute
would be white shirt that I showed
before or any kind of sweater kind of
just underneath and then have rip legs
but they're actually are like qalaat
excited to rock seeds in the springtime
okay that she went there because I'm a
little all over the place I got this
from Linda this is a size medium and
this is actually meant to be like off
the shoulder and then this part here is
completely open in the front like ties
really cute I thought this with some
high-waisted blue jeans would be so nice
really concise to cute in this video
then I got these shorts I like love
shorts like these because they're just
really nice to sleep in or to wear it's
the beach because I don't mind if they
get wet words like jean shorts kind of
stuff you say get wet take forever to
dry this is a size large because I
wasn't sure how it's been on my butt
actually if it's really nice so what it
looks like I like when shorts are baggy
oh this is a size large and I thought
this is really pretty
again Mexico or Coachella not sure I
love the tie details in the front and
this was like a hot these so cute with
like two big braids love and the last
two things which I'm really excited for
are these bags cleanser look they look
like the Chloe bags guys I'm telling you
what maybe not exact but so similar so
this is a backpack you can see I'm
definitely bringing this to Coachella
it's just like simple small backpack
that fits a lot of stuff in here and you
can also unzip it to make it a lot
bigger so excited about this
and then there's this curse which is
really cute as well and this is more
like a crossbody little tiny purse for
going out or something I thought the
color was so cute and I like this little
ring detail but actually opens up quite
a lot so you could definitely fit this
deep control of stuff that's what she
said the office reference anyone okay
does it I had made a mess and that is it
for my haul it is kind of big but I am
like I said planning on filming a ton of
videos of these things I really want to
do a spring like winter to spring out
