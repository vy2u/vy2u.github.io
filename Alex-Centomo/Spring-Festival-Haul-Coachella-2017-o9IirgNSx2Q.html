channel I am getting ready to leave for
Coachella tomorrow we're actually flying
to LA and then we drive down to Palm
Springs I'm so excited we're doing like
a little road trip and then we drive
back to LA after that and I obviously
have done some shopping for Coachella
now my plan is to film a legit lookbook
like lookbook from back in the day those
kinds of look books when I'm there so
these are the outfits I'm going to be
kind of putting together in styling so
this is not a try on haul I know
everyone gets frustrating cuz they want
to see what the clothes will look like
on me but my next video is literally
going to be all these on me styles in
locations so don't worry about that if
you're too anxious to wait you can also
check out my Instagram account because
I'll be posting in the pictures with all
the outfits on during this weekend I'm
so excited
if you guys are on Coachella or you were
there or going weekend to let me know if
you're going to any festivals let me
know give this video a thumbs up if you
enjoy it and don't forget to subscribe
turn those notifications on so you know
of my videos go live and let's get into
the video some of these items are
actually not these ones but some things
that I'm bringing to Coachella
I actually hauled in my last video so
always s linked down below and I say oh
I'm bringing this to Coachella so you
can actually get a sense of like
different things that I'm bringing but I
did order some new stuff and pick out a
few other things so I'm going to start
first I always start with brandy first
I'm gonna start with brandy first
because that's the last place I got
things from so I have to Kate first all
these cute little like pink suede shorts
would have it but it's like a shine to
them they're so cute oh my gosh it's
already starting guys the word cute so
these are adorable I was thinking this
with just a simple tank tops and
sneakers and then like a windbreaker
some chokers and a bunch of hair
accessories so this is like a maybe
option for Coachella like I would wear
these shorts and I picked up this simple
basic tank I mean it basically looks
like pajamas and then
you kind of make it a bit more styled
with a really cool windbreaker or kimono
or both not like the tattoos they put
the what are they clothing in they're
not permanent tattoos they're just put
the stick on ones and temporary tattoos
and a bunch of jewelry I think that
would be sweet and then I also got I
think this is more not for the actual
festival but for chilling in Palm
Springs I think these types of tanks are
really really so different they kind of
remind me of the 90s where the things I
used to wear and I really like the style
I like the colors in it and I like the
stripes it's simple but still adds a bit
of you know something different you're
an outfit because it's not just the
basic color and look at that guy's color
in my wardrobe speaking of color there's
this now okay when I went to Brandi I
was told that this comes also in a
windbreaker style and I wanted that so
bad and then soft you guys know Brandi
with their soft things but they
unfortunately only had a thicker one but
it's still really cute reminds me is
like a vintage Tommy Hilfiger jacket so
I thought this just kind of opened with
really basic like I showed you before
the outfit I just really liked that look
and maybe having one of these like
having it unzipped with one of these
over the shoulder this I probably would
it works to the actual festival but
again at night or all the drive to Palm
Springs I think this would be really fun
even just LA I just really liked it and
bought it specifically for this weekend
now I bought two articles of clothing
off of revolve I am actually getting
more sent to my hotel when I'm there so
there actually be a bit more of a
surprise in my lookbook but I don't know
exactly how I'm gonna style this yet I'm
thinking black high-waisted shorts but
it's just a simple yellow it's off the
shoulders but these are actually sleeves
so it's like an admiral to top that's
what I call it and it's just a basic
yellow crop top and gold jewelry would
be key with this and I was thinking
maybe a flower crown and some sandals so
if you guys have any suggestions feel
free to leave them down below I mean
this is
during the festival so I probably will
have figured out by then but this is an
option so it's going to look out for
this one and this is by the brand Jen's
Pirate Booty and it's in the side by the
way brandy Melville's all one size this
is on the size small so you have basic
crop top and then the second thing I got
are these really lightweight flowy
shorts I love the pattern on this and I
really like the color it's this really
pretty new neoprene what peony peony is
that the right colour I don't know it's
a baby blue with they look like Hawaiian
leaves and flowers and it's by the brand
wild fox and I love the material with
wild Fox this is the size medium high
waisted flowy and with a basic white
tank would be so fun for traveling or
using to go to and from the pool because
I really enjoy having just flowy you
know shorts rather than jean shorts or
something and you can make outfits out
of it so this is what I got from revolve
as always links will be down below for
everything so if you're curious to check
it out that's where you can do it then I
got this sent to me from for leaven
leavens it's a basic crop top it's what
is this what is this like what are the
Kabbalists leaves go to just your elbows
because it's not 3/4 length
it's almost leaves it literally goes
just your elbows and it ties in front so
it almost looks like a bralette kind of
thing I mean you're going to have to
wait and see how it looks on but I love
the patterns I love this ruffle
detailing that goes around the edges and
then it ties in a little knot under your
boobies and it's really really
lightweight and flowy I tried it on last
night when it came in the mail and my
sister was obsessed with it cuz she was
over she said I love that that's my
favorite so I know it's good on my
sister loves it then I got a few things
from a Windsor of course so this is
going to be really wrinkled and I
probably should steam it but the same
time is going my suitcase is going to
get wrinkled again it's an
off-the-shoulder crop top that has
longer sleeves and they're almost like a
bell as
and but then get tighter for your wrists
and I had a similar top like this from
for 11 lemons it was white I was a lot
more cropped but I had like an idea for
this in mind with some funky shorts and
the only thing is the bottom part is I
got a size large in this and oh by the
way this is a size medium so I got a
size larger that's because my shoulders
are a lot more broad so it fits
perfectly on top within the part that
goes around the waist is really big but
I mean it looks really fine in person so
I'm sure it'll be so it looks fine but I
was thinking wearing this in the desert
with some kind of like really ripped up
distressed high-waisted jeans booties
some kind of a hat maybe something like
this a bunch of accessories love it love
it love it I then decided on this outfit
so the first thing is this crochet
looking bra let flash halter top so as
you can see it'll just go around my neck
and my back and then covers the boobs
and I just really like this even that's
what I said shorts is so pretty but the
color of this skirt I just couldn't get
over it's so beautiful too maxi skirt so
it's really long and it has this really
beautiful crochet detail oh my gosh I
love it and it has a tie string it
actually doesn't tie just for decoration
this was a size let's see size medium
and I think size medium for the bottoms
as well size medium for this I could
have gone on a size small honestly but I
would prefer having it a bit loose and
too tight so I went beside up just in
case but I really enjoy the color of
this a lot and I think the black and the
yellow don't really know what color is
chance is beautiful and I feel like as
Morel de okay and then from Windsor as
well I got these two things they're like
jewels to wear around your eyes space
and that comes also like a little head
chain
and then I also got some fake with the
cold September things so I got a bunch
and gold so I mean it just basically
looks like this I'll show you guys and
then I gotten a silver as well so it'll
be some kind of accessory some
accessories from love AJ they came in
these cute little boxes the first thing
is this choker and this one is silver
it's going to look kind of layered on
it's beautiful and I love AJ is where I
get all my earrings for those of you
that ask all the time I love the look of
their earrings or the quality is really
great
so I never have an issue with that they
never turned brassy or anything which is
great I also got a pair of earrings like
this this is going to be really hard to
see I don't even know if you can see
this it's just like basically little
earrings and then I got a it looks like
a bra so I'm going to wear this over a
bra Lac with high-waisted shorts and
maybe a kimono for a specific look it
adds some detail you literally cannot
see this oh my goodness well you'll see
it in the video but I think any kind of
body jewelry and fun accessories are a
great touch to any outfit then the last
two things I got are this top from spell
I think I actually got this off of
revolve but like two months ago so I'm
not sure if it's still there but if I
find a link I'll link it down below
it's from spell gypsy and it's just a
really oversized blouse that's super
open so I probably have a kind of off
the shoulders I love the color of this
so this is high-waisted shorts goodies
and a hat is great I love the color as
well and this is actually a hat that I
got not for that look but I have another
look in mind
I love the western style of this hat
this is from lack of color Australian
brand and this is in the size small this
is in the size large and then the last
thing which I don't on the sides because
it was a vintage tea but I cut it up
like crazy it was just a vintage Rolling
Stones tea but I cut it to make it look
cropped and I cut the neckline so it's
more open
and it just says Rolling Stones I think
yeah this is the 1972 one and this I
found in a random vintage shop in LA
like when I was there in January so
couldn't tell you where to get something
like this but I thought this with a
bralette sticking through high-waisted
shorts with booties so my vibe and I'm
also going to be bringing this which I
purchased and I brought this to Mexico
and I used it but I still have 12
pictures left available so I'm going to
use those at Coachella I'm excited and
then I cannot wait to see if they look
like when I print them out so that is
everything that I am planning on
bringing including the stuff that I
showed in the last haul and then as for
shoes nothing new like everything's
stuff I've owned for years now I'm
wearing the same booties I wore Porcello
last year and the year before they're
the same brown western style looking
booties and everything is said I'm so
excited so make sure you're checking out
