haul video for you guys it's kind of a
spring haul it's a collective haul so
it's not stuff that I purchased all at
once I'm still waiting for some stuff in
the mail it's just taking a long time to
get here so I was thinking of doing like
a spring haul part 1 in a spring haul
part 2 that way the video isn't so long
because I'm I did purchase a lot of
things I have to be split into two parts
so this is kind of like my transition
into spring and then my second one will
be more like a full on spring clothing
and where I live right now it's still
really cold so I could not really get
away with wearing much spring clothes at
the moment but yeah just let me know in
the comments below if you're okay with
that let's just get started so the first
couple of things I got are from brandy
melville and the first thing is just
this like clean white crop t-shirt and
what I really like about this t-shirt it
reminds me a lot about the tops that you
get from Topshop the sleeves are like a
kind of cuffed sleeve and they just hang
off your shoulder like right here so I
know it's really flattering on me
because I have broad shoulders and I
just think it looks really nice and it's
cropped and it's just it's a nice color
for spring and summer and I just really
like the quality of this because it's
thick and it's kind of like boxy and it
just I know it's really cute I like it a
lot the next thing I got from brandy is
this crop t-shirt and just has stripes
on it it's crop enough that you can wear
it with like low waisted boyfriend jean
shorts and you'll see a little bit of
your stomach but it's not too cropped
that if you you'll see your stomach
without high-waisted shorts so I really
like the style of this and I like how
the sleeves have a little like dark
detailing here on the edges and I just
really like stripes for some reason this
season I've been really into stripes you
could probably tell by my Instagram I
post a lot of pictures with striped
clothing and the next one again is
striped
it's just a little t-shirt and what I
like about this is the material of it
it's so soft and very stretchy and it's
a little bit of a v-neck and this one
again is like the same kind of thing
with the other one it's not super super
cropped but it's like a
really really good length if you're
wearing something a little low waisted
because then you could see a little bit
of your stomach which I find really
flattering the last thing I got from
brandy again is stripes I just feel like
I'm getting so many strike things this
season you watch this summer my wardrobe
is going to be stripes I don't know why
stripes a thing it is for me
so I just really like this color
especially you like with my hair I just
find it looks really nice and I just
picture myself with the child and I'm so
excited I apologize for my illness and
if your eyes are blinded by my ghostly
appearance anyways so this top it's a
crop so this one is more crop than the
other ones and it's kind of like longer
sleeves so they're not like a t-shirt
material they're more like longer done
in the arms and this one's more of a
boxy kind of crop top so it's a very
like white t-shirt I just really like
the material this is the same one as the
other it's a very bouncy and stretchy
and soft I just really like branding
materials they're so soft the next three
things I got are from Windsor and the
first thing is this knit sweater and I
know sweater is not very spring but I
this I finally be so perfect in the
spring because especially where I live
or it's kind of cold even around Easter
time it's still very cold so I can wear
this with some high-waisted jeans are
just a really cute skirt and some thigh
high socks I think would be really cute
and it's just this knit cream sweater
and what I really like about this
sweater is that on the shoulders you
have like a detail right here and it's
kind of like um a crochet kind of detail
and that just runs from the shoulders
kind of down the arm and I just think
it's really nice plus the back of the
sweater is so super cute there's these
cute little bows and I just think it's
so so nice for spring and it's very
light material so it's not too hot so I
won't be like sweating or anything it's
the perfect item for a springtime where
I live the next thing from Windsor is
this kind of coral pink colored skirt
it's very bright I don't know if it's
gonna pick up on camera but it's just a
really cute circle skirt and
it's kind of a faux leather material so
it's very interesting and just there's a
little zipper in the back and I just
think this is so cute for spring and
summer I could just picture myself
wearing this with like some really nice
you know lacy crochet detailed tank tops
and stuff and you know maybe like that
jean jacket over it I just think it's so
cute I'm obsessed with that I cannot
wait for the weather to be warm and the
last thing I got from Windsor is this
sweater again it's very very thin
material it looks like this it's very
boxy and it's just three-quarter length
sleeves and what I like about the
sleeves of this is that it gets tighter
on the arm as it goes down so when it
gets near the armpit it's very baggy and
it's not like stuck to your body but the
thing I love about this the most is the
back cuz look oh my god how cute is that
it very it's very low in the back and
then there's huge bow and it's so cute
and it's kind of like a high-low thing
going on which that's my favorite when a
sweater is high-low so it's lower in the
back than it is in the front I just
really really really like this a lot and
it's so soft and so comfortable I'm just
so excited to start wearing this more
when the weather is nice and I can just
see myself wearing this in the summer
with even some jean shorts and some
converse I think it's so cute so the
next couple of items I got is from
luscom and I just have been really
wanting some nice basic dresses for kind
of different events so the first thing I
got is super cute and I need enough
fancy dress sort of I have a wedding
coming up so I was thinking of something
that I can be wearing to a more casual
wedding not like super super fancy it's
just this green dress and I'm here I'll
show you the top first so the top of it
kind of goes like into a v-neck and it
has these straps that go up on top and
then the back of it is open back and
they cross on the top like this and the
back is open so it's really flattering
and then the bottom of it is just like
this really really really flowy material
and it's so flattering on it's real
really pretty and I just like it because
it's like twirly and it reminds me of
Taylor Swift the next thing I got is
from Lulu's as well and this is by the
brand O'Neil and I really like this
dress it's like super pretty it's lace
and crochet and then it goes down and in
the middle it has like a cutout
detailing in it with like a little
drawstring that you could wear and it's
like super cute and then it's pretty
short and on the bottom it just has this
like kind of really cute material the
back just looks like this is just plain
but this is going to be so pretty on and
I would insert pictures of these but I'm
actually gonna be taking pictures in
Mexico so I will make sure to link those
down below once they're uploaded onto my
Instagram if you guys are interested and
probably I'll have a blogpost on what
these look like on but it's so pretty
this one probably goes to like mid thigh
and I just think it's like such a pretty
dress with like a really nice floppy hat
and some sandals I just think it's so
cute and the last thing I got from
Lulu's was just also so pretty I'm
actually so obsessed with this dress
it's a long maxi dress so I mean this
goes like all the way to the floor but
what I like about this is that there's
an open back so this is the back of it
how it sits and then right here it's
open from like here to here I don't know
if you guys can like see this Kasia I
wish I had pictures of this but I will
make sure to link them down below
anyways it's just open back from like
mid back to like right above your bum
which is really flattering and then it
kind of does has like cutouts on the
side so it shows like a bit of your
stomach and then the front of it is so
beautiful it's just a really really
really deep v-neck so these are the arms
and the v-neck goes all the way down
here so it goes all the way down almost
to your stomach it's so flattering I
just really love a deep V and I just
think this is gonna look so beautiful in
Mexico with a really floppy hat and just
on the beach oh my gosh I'm so excited
so I will make sure to insert some
pictures below when I have them uploaded
don't forget to check out my Instagram
it's instagram.com / Alex sent emotes
actually pronounced Chen Tomo because
I'm Italian but no one's really gonna
know that so sent Elmo if you want I'm
so pale oh my gosh so the last thing I
got is bikinis and the first thing I
went to Victoria's Secret and I was just
looking for some basic bikini tops
because a lot of my bikini tops are kind
of getting old and ruined so I was just
looking for something basic but then I
saw these bottoms and oh my gosh guys
these are so nice look at this okay
they're so bright first of all it's a
really bright pink and on the inside of
the coral color but the back is so
cheeky I am so excited to wear these I'm
really glad the Victoria's Secret is
starting to come out with some cheeky
bikinis because I am just obsessed with
those kind of bikinis and I just think
this is really cute there's just some
like ruching going on right here and I
just think it's like super nice and with
the town I think would look so great I'm
going to Mexico next week so I was
thinking I'm tell me some videos there
so if you have any suggestions for any
kind of video you want to see leave it

make sure to do something like that like
either some kind of like vacation
getaway lookbook or some how to style
bikinis or you know any kind of summer
you look book cuz I'll be on the beach
and I just have so many ideas but I just
definitely want to hear your suggestions
so leave them down below in the comments
the last thing of this haul is actually
something I'm really really excited
about because I have been wanting one of
these for the longest time and it is a
San Lorenzo bikini so I don't know if
you guys know San Lorenzo is kind of
like a pretty well-known brand through
Instagram and their bikinis are so nice
so I actually got this on Venus e-comm
and I will link their website down below
because the girl who runs that website
is amazing because you can't purchase on
the runs of bikinis off their website
you have to go through like a retailer
and this girl's website isn't me
she's so so nice really looks out for
the best of you wants to find the
perfect size bikini for you so
definitely go check out the website down
below also leave like their Instagram
and that kind of stuff down below check
them out and let me know what you think
because I just love the bikinis anyways
getting it to what it is I just got the
black one and this is what the talk
looks like so there is just like the
regular triangle bikini but they have
like this rope kind of like stretchy
fabric that starts from like kind of
like mid boob up onto your shoulders and
then the back of it is like this I don't
know if you guys can see it ties around
the conneautville bikini but the straps
kind of go down your back so it's like a
super super super cute fitted bikini
it's so flattering oh my gosh and it's
just so comfortable I've never won
bikini as comfortable my life and then
the bottoms are what I'm most excited
for because oh my freaking gosh look at
these they're so cute so this one is
actually really cool because it's
reversible so you can wear it as like a
black bottom or you could wear it as the
pattern bottom which I really really
like and the front of it just looks like
this kind of sits just on your hips like
that and on this side you have these
three rope material like you did on the
top of the bikini like that and it's
really flattering on your hips it's so
nice and then this is the back so it's
super cheeky again and this is so
flattering on your bum the guys I'm
telling you like it's so cute and it's a
perfect way to time your bum because I
mean who doesn't want to attend bum
