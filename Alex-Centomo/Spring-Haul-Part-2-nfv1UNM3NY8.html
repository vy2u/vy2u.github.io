with my spring haul part 2 video I know
this is like been requested for so long
I did my spring haul part 1 which I will
link down below if you guys are curious
to see I did get a lot of shipments in
so that's why I decided to split the
haul into two parts because I didn't
want to make the video like 30 minutes
long so that's why every time I film a
video I like talked with like my hands
like anyways so let's just jump into
this because I'm sure this videos gonna
be long I'm not gonna show you
everything I got if you're interested
you can check out my Instagram because I
do post everything on my Instagram
account so it is at Alex and Tomo or you
could just click the link in the downbar
and that way you could see everything
but if I showed you everything this
video would be forever so I will show
you like a few pieces from each thing
that I ordered from so let's just get
into that so I guess I'll start off with
Bragi because it means Randy Melville
and like you know you all know the
brandy Melville story with me yes sorry
my hair is like sober say I literally
just got out of the shower and this is
my natural hair guys so it's like you
know like frizzy and curly and dead so
cute
I know in my last spring haul video you
guys all fought like the frame is like
very close but that's just because like
I like to show you guys pictures of the
clothing rather than just like holding
up the clothes so like if I was further
back holding up the clothes it wouldn't
really be able to shoot I won't be able
to show you the clothes any better than
me sitting up close so I'm just going to
sit where I like to sit and then I will
insert pictures or like insert a little
video clip of me wearing the clothing
and you can get like a better sense of
what the clothes look like on a person
rather than me just like holding it up
which I'll do anyways to show you like
the color and stuff but I mean as a
whole I will insert some pictures the
first thing I got from braggy is this
really really nice green top it's crop
and I just really like the sleeves they
kind of go a bit longer on the arms but
they're not tight they're pretty loose
and I just really like the fabric of
this and it's very earthy and I don't
know I find it goes really nice with my
skin and especially when I have a ton in
this
I'm definitely wearing this a lot
although it's not like a real really
typical summer color I really like green
I find it super flattering on me because
my eyes are green and well I was right
my eyes sorry we scared you and yeah I
just I just really like these kinds of
tops cuz they're like they're flattering
on me okay let's just I'm gonna say
flattering a lot in this video
I like this the next thing I got from
brandy is this what is this
this sweater and it's like what color
would I say this is like a off-white /
green undertone / I don't know what
color sweater and it's like kind of
see-through which I kind of like because
I like to wear like a black lace bra
light with this and I just think it's
really pretty
and it's not super super long but it's
not crop either it fits like a perfect
length on my like body but I also have
to tuck it into high-waisted shorts or
do a little not that's just the way I
like to wear it and I also like to roll
up the sleeves and I just think has a
really nice neckline so it shows the
collarbone kind of like this shirt
actually kind of goes like this and um I
don't know I just really like it it's
like a kind of it's not a super soft
it's a knit material but it's really
thin and I know that in a summer I won't
be too hot when I wear this so that's I
got it I really like it then the next
thing I got is actually from john galt
and jean girl recently opened a store
their own store but they do still sell
their clothing items at Brown you don't
know if you guys ever noticed but they
do like the graphic tees and the
flannels and like the vintage stuff so
30 by self and Brandi that is that item
then it's a john galt item the shorts I
got are these vintage shorts they're
high-waisted and they're actually Levi's
and they're just drifted and sold at the
John Galt location or Brandi and they're
the ones with the cuffs and I actually
really like the ones of the cuffs cuz I
don't own any high-waisted shorts with
cuffs on them and I just always wanted a
pair I don't know what size these are
because there's no sizes on them they're
just like various sizes so I just
grabbed bunch and I chop I think I tried
on like 11 before I found the one I
really liked and I like this color I'm
sure you guys have seen me wear this a
lot in my Instagram I find it's like a
little baggy on me which I actually
really like because most most of my high
waisted shorts are pretty tight so it
was just cool to have something
different I got a few things from job
breaking and jaw breaking is a website
that I discovered through love lauren
elizabeth on youtube she posted a
picture wearing their weekend warrior
t-shirt and i just thought it was so
cool so i knew i had to check out the
website and then of course like all the
other youtubers were getting involved in
it I was just like I'm going jump on
this trend because I'm trying to I don't
know no I don't know I just I just like
the website it's really cool so one of
the things I got is this it's that I
woke up like this beanie I woke up like
this I'm so weird guys it's pink and
it's cool and I like to wear this around
my house and also I wear this out like a
couple times and a lot of people were
like they would see me they're like oh
my god like this and I was like flawless
JK not really but you know so next from
jaw breaking I got a shirt which says
live forever young it's just a basic
tank top it's kind of thicker and it
goes it's open a little bit on the sides
not too low and it sits like right on
your hips like where this is and I just
really the color it's very earthy and it
says live forever young just kind of
like tribal and cool and I just really
liked it the next is from an online
Australian website I actually ordered
from two different Australian websites
and I'll show you a few things from each
the first one is called steli and I just
really like their stuff it's really cool
and this thing I fell in love with it it
is this crop lace like bra light kind of
thing but it goes kind of low on your
stomach and it's see-through here and I
just think this is so pretty and reminds
me of something that like Vanessa
Hudgens would wear so that's why I got
it I just really like the way it fits
it's tight and I don't know I just I
just really like it
going to be wearing this a lot in the
summer with high-waisted shorts and like
a kimono I just think it's super cute
the next thing I got from that website
are these shorts and these are really
really fun colorful shorts there are
high-waisted shorts and then they kind
of go like higher up on the sides and
they're flowy and loose and I don't know
I just think Australian websites are
awesome I've been obsessed with them
lately I just really like the colors of
it it's super nice will be so nice when
I'm tan in the summer my tan from Mexico
is of course bating the next is from
another Australian website this one
actually haven't posted a picture of me
yet just because I've been waiting to
take a picture outside but it's raining
where I'm living and it just does not
stop raining and I don't know why
anyways it's this dress from this is
from hunted dreams so again another
Australian website and it's just like
this really boxy dress on top is white
and it's just kind of like a square it's
it's really nice on your shoulders and
then it has this really really cool
detail here I don't know I thought this
was so cool the colors are so nice
they're really bright and I don't know I
just really really like the look of this
it's like super cute it's not sure it
kind of goes to like mid-thigh and I
like wearing this with like big chunky
heels and like a really floppy hat I
just think it's so cool and I definitely
know in the summer time when I'll have
to go to like nicer dinners and stuff
I'll be able to wear that I'm just
really excited for that I like it a lot
and again from huntin dreams I just got
this lace kimono and what I liked about
this kimono is that it was all lace but
also that on the sleeves they had this
like really cool fringe I don't know I
just thought that was like super unique
and fun and I really like the way this
fits on me it's not too long and it's
really cool so that's why I got it so on
the whole like festival music festival
trend slash like hippy whatever here cuz
I'm super into the bohemian vibe late
vibe lately this is my new favorite top
of all time I am actually so obsessed
with it
it is this top from for lovin Leben's
it's like a crop top so it goes like
right under your boobs but it sits off
your shoulders like this so it'll be
like this off your shoulders and then
this sleeves are like loose and they get
a bit bigger on the end but then they're
tighter on the sleeves and this is
actually the top that kendall Jenner
wore to Coachella and I saw her wear it
I was just like oh my god I need this
top so that's why I got it you can get
it I believe it's actually sold out on
for love and lemons but I know they're
selling it at Nasty Gal so if you want
to check that out definitely go for it
it is like my new favorite top of all
time I just think it's so pretty I love
shirts that up a bad word whatever
I love shirts that sit off the shoulder
like this I just think they're so pretty
and although I have broad shoulders I
really like showing it off that way
because I just think it's really nice
and it's bohemian and I'm just like so
excited to wear this I'm for sure gonna
be wearing this out even now even though
it's not summer yet where I'm living I
don't care the next thing I got is from
this website called pink ice and they
actually contacted me and offered to
send me some stuff for Instagram to post
on my Instagram account but I'm actually
obsessed with this website now oh my
gosh it's so nice the top wearing right
now is from there I'll insert a picture
right here I just like oversized gray
tee I just love it it's so soft and it
was like really affordable and then I
got this kimono from them and what I
love about this kimono not only is the
detail on it so nice and like the
material super nice but it's like so
long it goes all the way down to like my
ankles practically and I'm just like
super into the long kimonos lately I
don't know why I think they're so cool
so this is definitely something I
recommend I just love it and obsessed
with it and then I got a few things from
lookbook first thing this top some
people might not like it but I just
think it's like really unique and fun
and it's like a bunch of roses on it and
this is like three-quarter length
sleeves and it's a crop top and I just
it's like really pretty I think it's
very feminine and I would wear it
probably with like some really cute jean
shorts and some heels I probably wear it
up for dinner like a fancier dinner with
like a big chunky necklace or something
I think it's really really pretty and
feminine and that's why I got it then I
got this white top from the lookbook as
well it's so pretty it has this like
crochet cutout on like the arms like
this how pretty is that
and on the bottom and has a crochet as
well and I just think this is something
that's like so free people and I just
like I could picture myself wearing this
in Greece
I'm not going to Greece and I have no
plans of going to Greece I would love to
go to Greece but I'm not I just got this
salsa coat so we're not in Greece how
rude is that
my hair is just getting like frizzier
and frizzy or as this videos going on
I'm I'm so sorry guys so the last two
things I got from lookbook is this like
long-sleeve shirt that's gray and I just
really liked it cuz it's like simple in
the front it's kind of cropped but then
the back is like an open v-neck
I don't know how explain this it just
like it's open my head can go through
it's really cool it's really flattering
I love it can't wait I'm gonna wear it
with like necklaces hanging down in the
back I just think it's cool and then the
last clothing item I got is from
lookbook as well and it's just a maxi
black dress but it's like super flowy
and like I feel like a Spanish dancer
when I'm wearing this I have no idea why
I just think it's like it's so pretty
and flattering now the last thing I want
to talk about they're actually having
braces from a really good friend of mine
from my hometown I just think they're
absolutely beautiful all of her
bracelets like come with a story and
they're named after someone that
inspired somebody else and I just think
it's really nice and she was nice enough
to give me two samples of her bracelets
they're from her wanderer collection and
I think they're amazing I love them I
mean can we just like take a moment to
look at this
