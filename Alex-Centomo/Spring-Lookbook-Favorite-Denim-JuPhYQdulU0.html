didn't know that I was getting ready the
other day to film a spring lookbook for
you guys which by the way where I live
we didn't really get a spring it
literally went from freezing cold to
summer weather so it's very strange
right now but I still want to film a
spring lookbook for you guys and then I
realized that like every single outfit I
was picking out that I really liked was
all like denim I had denim incorporated
into like every outfit so I was like hmm
instead of making just a typical spring
lookbook like I normally do why don't
you I do something kind of like my
favorite denim jeans for spring and
summer kind of video I still don't know
the title of this video so I'm still
trying to work out what this video is
but basically I filmed some outfits with
my favorite jeans I'm wearing for the
spring and summertime aka right now
things I've been loving to wear my
favorite trends and everything like that
I hope you guys enjoy and let's get into
the video
this first look has to be my absolute
favorite because I just think it's like
classic Alex so these jeans are just
vintage Levi's this top is from brandy
melville this hat is Jack Vinick and
this sick leather white backpack is from
daily look it's actually vegan leather
but I just think this whole outfit
screams my name plus my classic white
vans and choker necklace from pneumatic
store love it I like to think I'm really
cool in this outfit these are my
favorite Birkenstocks and then my one
teaspoon shorts which are boyfriend
shorts I love them this shirt from daily
look and of course my choker from
nomadic store and some key Australia
sunglasses I feel super trendy
I love this outfit so these booties from
Nasty Gal are honestly my new favorite
booties ever and then as small as these
shorts from one teaspoon so obsessed
this top is brandy melville I'm just
wearing a free people bra let underneath
and then I have my key Australia
sunglasses that are designed by Shay
Mitchell love her so much
PLL forever I also think that the
boyfriend jean is perfect for this time
of year because of the relaxed fit it's
super cute and casual
oh hey overalls probably the last time I
actually wore overalls for real was when
I was a child and I thought it was super
cool
and this bralette is from windsor store
I just think it's super cute and I love
this outfit together
I feel very 90s chic but this is so in
for the summer
wow so I hope you guys enjoyed that
video it was really cool actually
because Daniel helped me film it and we
went to this like really cool spot where
there's like big houses and castles and
stuff which is really cool if you guys
did enjoy this video make sure you give
it a big thumbs up let's try and get it
to five thousand thumbs up again
because you guys are awesome and it
totally makes me happy and if we get
five thousand thumbs up then I will
