channel I have been getting so so so
many requests lately to do a spring
makeup tutorial I haven't done like a
full-on beauty guru makeup tutorial in a
very long time so since it is officially
spring where I live in Montreal even
though it's still raining but that just
means that there's gonna be a lot of
flowers soon I got very inspired by like
the flowers and the pretty pastel colors
so I have been wearing this makeup and a
ton of videos lately as well as my hair
has always been up and like this crazy
bun and I did a tutorial where I showed
how to do this if you watch my blogs you
know that I wear my hair a ton like this
and every time I wear makeup this is
what I do so I just figured out to film
it for you guys and show you so maybe
you guys can get some inspiration for
the spring /summer months I also just
wanted to say a big thank you to
covergirl Pantene as Olay for partnering
with me on this video I'm so excited
because I got to test out a bunch of
their new products and show you guys and
I've been loving them the past few weeks
like seriously I've been tweeting about
them and snap chatting and blogging you
guys you know if you follow me on
everything you'll know you would have
seen that already but I figured I would
sit down and film this video today I
feel like my lighting is a little crazy
right now through they're very bright or
very dark and I can't figure it out
sorry anyways if you're curious to see
how I did this makeup then just keep on
watching starting off with my Olay
complete all day moisturizer with UV
protection you guys know I've been
obsessed with this moisturizer for a
while now some protection for my skin is
incredibly important to me and now that
it's spring the sun's out longer it's
stronger and I want to just really make
sure that my skin stays protected so
I've been using this all the time plus
it smells really good it just feels
really good on my skin is not greasy or
oily or anything like that
on to the BB cream which I am obsessed
with this if you guys follow me on
anything social media related you will
know because I love the stuff so much
when I'm out all day it's hard to find
the time to touch up my makeup and I
generally get a little bit oily
throughout the day so I found that this
foundation / BB cream really works to
give me a shine free look that lasts
really all day long it leaves a really
like smooth velvety finish and it
doesn't dry out my skin which is awesome
because you guys know I do suffer from
dry flaky skin and this product does not
dry it out at all which is awesome
whatever product I have left over on my
hands I kind of just put that over any
blemishes I have I don't typically
always use concealer I find like the
last makeup on my face the better I like
it and I don't know this gives such a
good coverage that I feel like I don't
even need anything else then going in
with a covergirl blush I like to use
this as a blush slash ron's err it's
just really dewy and bright and I like
it a lot then filling in my eyebrows you
guys know I struggle with this for me
but I found this product that I think
works really well it's not too like
harsh like you can kind of press
strongly with it and you can't really
mess up
and then going in with my nude palette I
use this almost on a daily basis when
I'm wearing makeup because it's very
natural-looking so I like to use two
shades for all over my lid and then I go
in with more of like a fluffy brush and
use a darker shade but I mainly use this
just in my crease cuz I like to kind of
add it as a shadow to make it look like
I have more of an eyelid because I have
very hollowed eyes you can't really see
makeup when I'm wearing any eyeshadow so
if I do this it creates the look of like
a bigger eyelid and just give some
definition to my eyes and I think it's
really flattering and then I take the
shimmery color and I put that all over
the eyelid as well as underneath my brow
bone and also in the inner corners
because I think that looks really pretty
and it gives a really brightening look
which i think is so perfect for spring
and then I just blend out all the colors
just to make sure that there's no harsh
lines and then taking those two darker
colors I'm using that for underneath my
lash line and then I'm going to just
blend that out then using the intensify
me liquid eyeliner I am just going in
and making a wing this is like a perfect
product to make winged liners because
you can make a thick wing and also very
thin wing depending on how you use the
little stick
using the covergirl super sizer fibers
which is my new favorite mascara this
makes my eyelashes look so amazing look
at this look at the difference how long
and beautiful they are they're also very
natural and I get so many compliments
every time I use this mascara and it's
really really easy to take off
afterwards I got night and stuff but it
doesn't come off throughout the day and
it doesn't smudge underneath my eyes
which is like perfect for me and then
using my covergirl Oh sugar lip balm I
am just applying this to my dry lips it
adds a little bit of color moving on now
to my covergirl colorlicious lip sticks
I use two different shades and because
the winter always leaves my lips in
desperate need of moisture for
springtime this lipstick is the best way
to have bright bold lips while providing
it the much-needed moisture it needs
this lipstick is packed with avocado
olive butters and vitamin E and I've
actually been using a few of these
shades recently
then moving on to my hair this is like I
think third day hair haven't washed it
in three days and I'm just gonna go in
with my Herbal Essences naked dry
shampoo which you guys know I love it
smells amazing
feels amazing does not leave my hair
feeling crispy or anything like that
then I'm just putting up into this bun
and then using my Pantene air spray hair
spray product and this hair spray is the
first ever alcohol-free aerosol
hairspray and I've mentioned it a few
times in my other videos but I'm still
obsessed with it you can still run your
fingers through your hair without
worrying about hair losing style or
shape it doesn't get crunchy or sticky
also because it doesn't have alcohol in
it it's actually smells really really
good and I just like putting it onto any
hairstyle I have just because it adds an
amazing hold without it feeling
disgusting so this is the finished
product I love the way the makeup looks
I kind of downed my brightness you could
see properly what it looked like I love
the hair and I think it looks amazing so
I hope you guys enjoyed this tutorial
let me know how you like this type of
makeup so if you are curious to purchase
or to look up any of the products that I
used I will have them listed down in the
description best thing about this

you guys to do a full on drugstore
