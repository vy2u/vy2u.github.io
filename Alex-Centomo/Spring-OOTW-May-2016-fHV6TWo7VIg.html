channel surprise with another video this
weekend I really feel like I haven't
been putting out that much content for
you guys on this channel like as much as
I used to so I decided that I was going
to put out three videos this weekend so
I have one Friday Saturday and today so
if you're curious to watch the other two
and if you haven't seen them yet I'll
link those down below for you guys I
haven't done an outfit of the week video
in the longest time so I decided to film
another one for you guys today and I
hope you get inspiration from it if you
have any questions about the outfits
everything will be list in the
description I will put as many ones as I
can if I can't find exact I'll put
something similar but yeah if you're
curious to see what I wear in a typical
week for the spring then just keep on
watching
you
there's a place up Ocean Avenue where I
used to sit and talk with you
we were both 16 and it felt so right
there's a place on the
semitone
I'm not
a woman of the heartbreak I don't need
another turn to cry
no I don't want to learn the hard way
baby hello whoa no goodbye but you got
the like a rocket shoot straight across
the sky
the way you love me
you like me
so I hope you guys enjoyed the video if
you did make sure to give it a big
thumbs up and also let me know in the
comments which outfit was your favorite
and what you would typically wear and
also maybe give me some inspiration what
you like to wear in the spring /summer
I'm so excited this is like one of my
favorite fashion because I can finally
go out without wearing a coat so it's
the best I love you guys all so much I
hope you enjoyed the last three videos
and if you have any other suggestions
let me know and I'll see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
