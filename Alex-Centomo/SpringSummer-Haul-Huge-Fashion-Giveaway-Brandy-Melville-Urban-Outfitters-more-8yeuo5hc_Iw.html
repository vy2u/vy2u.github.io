this video today because not only is
this a huge spring /summer haul but it's
also gonna be my first giveaway of this
season I'm gonna be doing a few
giveaways throughout the summer and I
figured I would kick off this one with
just a fashion that giveaway but I
definitely want to dabble in more like
cosmetics and beauty and skincare and
all that kind of stuff those kinds of
giveaways so make sure you stay tuned
until the end to see how you can enter
the giveaway let's get started so if you
guys didn't know I was in New York City
oh by the way I am NOT naked I'm wearing
the top under hair but my hair is kind
of covering that um anyways I was in New
York City last weekend and I did some
shopping when I was there obviously I
didn't buy too much stuff but I figured
I would incorporate that into this haul
and I have been doing some shopping
throughout the weeks and stuff now
before I get started I just want to say
this isn't gonna be a try on haul I know
a lot of you guys like to see those but
for one I have a fashion account on
Instagram and I post pictures of me
wearing the clothing and like every
single picture so if you're interested
to see how these clothes look on me then
definitely check out my Instagram I will
leave a link down below little self
promo but I mean it does make sense you
know you could see how the clothes look
like on me and I always post fashion
pictures because I run a fashion account
if you guys didn't know that I guess
I'll start off with the stuff I got in
New York City cuz it's not that much I
went to free people and I got this top
it's just a basic oversized Henley
t-shirt with like the buttons in the
front it's this like kind of faded army
green color and I like having all the
buttons opened so that it's kind of load
down in the front it's very loose and
flattering I got this as well as this
bra let and I actually liked wearing
them together because if you could see
this Brella it has this like detail
cutout up here and it's really cool to
see the open shirt with these straps
kind of sticking out I think it's really
nice Plus this bralette is super
comfortable it's actually not
see-through which I was pretty surprised
about and this is the first bra light I
own that has an underwire so the next
place we went to in New York City that I
actually bought stuff from was - if you
guys aren't a fan of the Kardashians
wouldn't know this but they have a
boutique I've always wanted to go in and
I was just expecting to browse but then
I found this bathing suit and I actually
fell in love with it so I'll show you
guys the bottoms first these are the
bottoms this is the back this is the
front yep it's pretty cheeky but I think
it's super cute perfect for summer it
has this like detail on the sides right
here that are like strappy with like
almost it looks a little bit like lace
or something I don't really know how to
explain it but it's a very pale pink
color I think it'll look great with a
tan and it's also reversible so has like
light pink polka dots on the other side
and then this is the best part the top
looks like this so it's like a halter
bikini I know not everyone is a fan of
these but I think they're so incredibly
nice I really really really like the way
this looks on me I'm super stoked to
wear this in Santorini I think it'll
look great well obviously I probably
wouldn't tan in this like for long
periods of time so I wouldn't want this
weird tan line but I think for like a
really pretty picture a pool party
beach party it would be perfect for that
so that is what I got in New York City I
also went to LFT and I got some things
there but I don't want to show you yet
because I'm waiting to film a lookbook
with those but I basically got just a
few things and I know I'm excited to
show you that they are I guess no stuff
I just bought on my own in my share or
online so the first place I shopped at
was a Windsor and I just wanted a really
basic basic tee and then I came across
this on their website and I'm actually
obsessed with it so it looks like this
it's kind of a cropped very soft t-shirt
it's like a baseball tee very big
neckline with just simple gray sleeves
I've honestly worn this like every
single day to bed and then like I kind
of just wear it outside because like who
knows it worked about right it's very
comfortable very classic and I don't
know I really really like these style
tops I think they're super flattering on
my body type and I
they're simple kind of another similar
top from Windsor it's this
salt-and-pepper one it has these on the
sleeves which I think are super cool but
this one's like very oversized you can
almost wear this as a dress like that's
how big it is I really really like it
again very soft I would wear this with
like boyfriend jeans or boyfriend jean
shorts and it kind of goes up high on
the side my sister actually got the same
exact tee but like opposite so she got
the dark tee with like the lighter
stripes and I think it looks amazing
then the next thing I got from Windsor
is this top I got this it's like a
bralette top kind of it's just all black
lace detail but the reason why I got
this is because I really want to wear
this under basic crop t-shirts so I
would just wear like let's say from
brandy like a very basic crop tee and
then have the lace sticking out
underneath I think that would look so
nice with like high-waisted jeans or
something I really like that look so
that is a reason why I got this super
excited to style that can't wait to show
you guys what I come up with I then went
to Brandi and I got a few things so I
guess I'll start off with like the least
summer item but I still would wear this
in the summer it's just a sweater guys
my obsession with sweaters is real I
just can't stop
but this sweater from Brandi I love it
because of the sleeves I think these
stripes are awesome super cool and
detailed and yeah it's just like an
oversized sweater simple Brandi sweater
love it love this color in the summer
with a tan I think it looks great and
this would like some just basic blue
wash jeans would be amazing or even jean
shorts with some really cute sandals and
a baseball cap I love that look like
your hair in a ponytail like anyway the
next thing I got is this basic team it's
a light blue color sort of a ribbed
material very stretchy simple blue
t-shirt love this color in the summer
very excited to wear this the next thing
is this halter t-shirt I really like
whoa this is like picking up really
weird on camera but it's basically red
and white small stripes and it's a
halter but it has a really cool neck and
detail right here where like as a little
cut
and I think that's awesome then the next
thing I got were these shorts I think
these are so cute I mean look at these
they're just like simple everyday shorts
with black stripe detailing on the edges
and they're just very classic and I
would so wear these to work out and to
go to sleep it's like very versatile and
then the last thing from brandy is this
simple gray cropped tee there are three
quarter length sleeves it's a dark gray
color with a pretty big neckline and
it's almost like a thick material I want
to say but it's very very flattering
love wearing this with some high-waisted
blue denim jeans or even black with rips
in the knees and some my white bottoms I
think would look so cute and then like a
flannel tied around the waist like how
adorable is that then the next thing I
got were two pairs of sunglasses from
key buy Australia if you guys have
watched my lookbook from two weeks ago
or last week yeah last week you would
have seen you will recognize these and
if you follow me on instagram you will
these are the first pair I think they're
so cool they're gold
they're key by Shay Mitchell so she
designed these ones which I think are
awesome this is what they look like
super cool and then the next pair I got
were these ones I think these are so
cool because they're all black but they
have like a matte black outline and
they're just a very simple shade I
really like them and I think they suit
my face really well and they're so
comfortable and one great thing about
these is that they don't give you those
marks on your nose like right now I kind
of have them from my actual seeing
glasses because I wear actual glasses I
manage so annoying when you're wearing
makeup and then you have this like it
kind of rubs off the makeup and you have
these two lines on your nose I don't
know if you guys know what I'm talking
about but it happens to me all the time
and these don't do that so I'm just like
yes thank you looks great I could take
off my glasses and I'll have to worry
about big street marks on the side of my
nose that's it for my fashion stuff that
I got I actually just went to Sephora
today and picked up a few things so I
thought I would show you guys just
because I literally just bought it oh my
god I completely forgot about something
I almost forgot to show you guys my new
obsession my
shoes look at these babies oh my gosh so
these are Isabel my Ross shoes I
actually was fortunate enough to get
this as a gift so I didn't pay for them
I know they're very pricey but these are
like the most comfortable sandals I've
ever owned in my entire life like
they're so comfy I don't know what this
material is but it's squishy and I just
love squishing it and it looks so and
I've been wearing these sweatpants from
Urban Outfitters for the past like three
days in a row really gross I know but
they're so soft and comfortable and I've
been wearing them with these sandals and
just like a simple key oh yeah oh my
gosh I'm all over the place
today were those shoes with these
sweatpants and then this top oh if you
guys can see so that top is actually
from Windsor that's another thing I got
and I can't believe I forgot to talk
about this I guess because I'm wearing
it I forgot but it they are my new
obsession these cropped bad B tops are
so cute and I'm so down for it and I
think it's awesome so that would my
high-waisted supersoft sweats and then
those shoes and like a jean jacket
thrown over love it I just posted on
Instagram and you guys seem to love it
as well okay so onto my support stuff
sorry guys the first thing I got because
I ran out of was the Urban Decay all
nighter setting spray they only have a
small one which sucks because I love
them obviously I love this product then
also because I was out I got the Tarte
Amazonian clay full face 12 hour of full
coverage foundation oh my gosh I don't
know what I'm saying
this is like my summer foundation I
don't want foundation every single day
like I'm not wearing any foundation
today I'm just wearing concealer on
places that I need but on days that I'm
doing like big photo shoots or something
like that I love to wear foundation and
for some reason my face just does not
ten when I get spray tans it just
doesn't work like at all I don't know my
face like doesn't pick up pigment
I need foundation that's gonna match the
rest of my body I'm not really wearing
makeup my face so it kind of looks a
little weird but this will match the
rest of my body so that's why I got it
and then the last thing I got is a lip
liner from Make Up For Ever this is in
the color 3c I wanted to get the Naked 2
lip liner because Kyla has someone and
it's always so beautiful when she wears
it and they didn't have it but they said
this was like identical to that so
hopefully it is
I haven't opened it yet but I'm gonna
test it out tomorrow
last thing that I got is another bro let
this is by 411 lemons I love this I've
been seeing it online so much and I kept
wanting it in the black color and then I
was like you know what whatever I want
them yellow cuz it's super bright and
it's like the softest bra I own whoa
super cute under kind of like a
see-through white top because you can
kind of see it so now on to the giveaway
sorry that Hall was like so long but I
needed to show you everything I'm going
to start off with an accessory so the
first thing you can win is a pair of
sunglasses these are seriously so cool
look at them so sick you know I'm gonna
try them on for you woah I feel like a
celeb when I wear these so these are the
first things for you I love them I think
they're so cool then I went to Urban
Outfitters for you guys and I picked up
two things that I am act or know three
things that I'm actually obsessed with
so the first thing is this really cool
crop top it's a really cool like yellow
color very awesome design on it and this
is just so my style this was like
high-waisted jeans or high-waisted jeans
shorts is just awesome the next thing I
thought was quite funny the style of the
shirts awesome and then I liked the
graphic on it as well so it's just this
simple white crop top that's it's almost
like a muscle crop top cuz it's super
open on the side and it says one of the
boys which i think is so cute it's high
neckline so my style love these kinds of
t-shirts so I got this for you guys and
then the last thing I got was this
headband cuz if you guys don't follow me
on Instagram you won't know but I am
obsessed with wearing these kinds of
headbands like pulled over halfway down
I don't want to put this on in case I
get makeup on it and I don't want to get
makeup on it for you guys but love this
pattern I think it's super super cute
very very soft material and I love
wearing that so I thought you know what
I'll incorporate a little bit of my
style into this giveaway since it is my
giveaway then of course I went to a
brandy Melville for you guys and shove
everything in here the first thing you
guys will be winning is this top how
cute is this look at this I love this
top so it's just like a high neckline
really cool
cut-out croft t-shirt it's almost like a
sweater material but very stretchy I
love this top so much I own this in like
a light gray color but the pink ones
like the dusty rose pink is beautiful so
I got this and then I also got this top
which is just a simple white tank kind
of low in the front same kind of ribbed
material very stretchy love this with
just any kind of jean any denim looks
super cute especially for layering and
stuff this is like a must-have
then on to t-shirts I got this one
because you guys obsess over this on
Instagram but it's just a basic cropped
t-shirt that's gray same sort of
material again that like ribbed sweaters
stretchy material so cute love this then
I decided to get you guys a kind of bra
let's because these are so popular at
brandy and I own like so many colors of
this but it looks like this it's I mean
you can wear this as a crop top if
you're tiny enough to do that with
high-waisted shorts but I mean for me it
kind of looks more like a bra let so I
love wearing this layered under things
having these parts poked out I think are
super super flattering and then the last
thing from brandy are these amazingly
comfortable shorts which I feel like
everyone has but they are just the
classic vodi shorts in grey because
Grey's my favorite color and I know this
is a summer giveaway but grey is
literally my favorite color and I love
this with like a simple white t-shirt
it's so cute and like vans love that
look the last thing in my giveaway I got
you two tops from fresh tops because I
know you guys love fresh tops and so I
went through my Instagram and looked
through what you're like favorite top
was like the ones that you liked the
most and the first one is this laptop
here that says I would date you but
you're not Dylan O'Brien what so good
love this t-shirt I mean if you guys
watch Teen Wolf or The Maze Runner you
will know how dreamy Dylan O'Brien is so
congrats to whoever gets that because
he's a stud going on with a whole stud
theme this t-shirt is a t-shirt with a
print of Harry Styles Twitter on it so
this one says I study rainbows and I
think that's so funny it's just a really
really flowy t-shirt
