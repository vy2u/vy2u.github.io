this video today because it has been
much requested for a very long time and
then I kind of went through my wardrobe
and was like oh my gosh I haven't done a
haul in a long time and there are so
many things that I bought but I'm kind
of freaking out so before I get into
this haul I just want to say that this
is not gonna be a try on haul I know a
lot of people love Tryon hauls but I'm
actually filming a lookbook when I'm in
Italy with all of these clothes that I'm
gonna show you so I don't want to show a
Tryon when you're gonna see what they
look like on me and like my next video
which is gonna be my like Amalfi Coast
Sorrento lookbook super excited about
that also I'm going to be taking a ton
of pictures in the outfits on my
Instagram so if you guys want to go
follow me on instagram you can do that
see what they all look like on me very
excited to show you everything there's a
lot of stuff so I'm just gonna get into
it because I'm a little overwhelmed okay
where do I start I'll start with brandy
melville because that's huge for you
guys you guys love brandy so first thing
I got was this top super cute loops tag
it's a halter top I don't know if it's
picking up very well on camera but it's
a muted purple color it's low in the
back and it's just a whole term crop top
super cute very into the muted purples
pinks and blues this summer it's a huge
trend but I'm all for it I love it
next thing I got these are actually
gonna be my pajama shorts when I'm in
Sorrento they're just like simple grey
stretchy sweat shorts with little like
ruffle detailing on the side they're
very comfortable very cute and they're
very like booty shorts on me that's why
they're gonna be my pajama shorts
because there's no way I'm going out in
public with this my butt hangs out and
it's um
you know next thing I got which this is
all over Instagram so I'm sure you guys
will be like oh I know what that looks
like on this little crop top slash of
bralette because um I'm not very flat in
the chest area although it might seem
that way from my Instagram pictures and
my videos I'm not that flat so I'm got
boobs so this isn't a crop top on me
this is more like a real leg so I would
wear this under a low-cut t-shirt so you
have these things poking out or if I'm
feeling a little scandalous that day
I'll wear it with high-waisted shorts
and a kimono because I love me out of
that look I got another halter but this
time it's more of a like sweater
material it's a light gray and not
sweater like crochet stretchy I don't
know how to explain this it's the
coolest material ever really comfortable
and I'm gonna totally wear this like
every single day in Sorrento then I got
another tank top I thought this would
like match perfectly with Sorrento I
don't know when I think of Sorrento I
think of green but it's just a simple
tank these are like the classic brandy
tanks super cute excited to wear this
with a 10 and some denim shorts just
keeping it simple then I got this other
halter which i think is so cute it looks
like this not hold here it's like what's
it called what do these tops call them
they're like high neckline and then they
go like this I don't know if they're
called but this is a loose one and it's
a bit longer so it's not completely
cropped so adorable I love the pattern
on this and I'm probably gonna wear this
out one night then I got this top it is
a which way does this go okay
it's a crochet crop top very soft it's a
cream color and it goes a bit lower in
back if you can see and I really like
this simple and it's like longer on the
strap so it's kind of more low down
which I really like in tops I don't like
one top to sit too high unless they're
like meant to be a high neckline but
this obviously isn't so
then I got this top which might not be
everyone's cup of tea but I'm so into it
so it's like a dress shirt but like
floral detail and it actually buttons up
in the front but I'm gonna wear it open
with a bralette I might even wear it
with that white crop top bra that thing
that I just showed you and some
high-waisted shorts I think this is so
cute love this reminds me of like Hawaii
but I'm not going to Hawaii but I'm
gonna make it work guys kay that's
brandy melville then I get some shopping
at Windsor because you guys know I'm
obsessed with Windsor and their summer
stuff is just like the most amazing
thing ever the first thing I got is a
pair of shorts they look like this how
freaking cute are these oh my gosh I
cannot wait to wear these in Sorrento
they're so bright and colorful and
beautiful and I'm so extremely excited
and I love the drawstring and I wear
them high-waisted and they're like very
low-cut on the sides so they show off
your legs make your legs look long so if
you girls are struggling in that
department these shorts will be good for
you then these shorts which I think
these are my favorite but I like the
pattern of these ones better but look at
this oh my god it looks almost like a
skirt so this part here is very stretchy
so you can wear it any like length of
your body you can wear them low waisted
and have them like very baggy shorts but
I'm gonna wear them high-waisted and
have these shorts like showing off my
legs okay next I got another sweater
looking halter top for this one's from
Windsor and it's a taupe color and it's
also inside-out cute this is in the size
small its it runs a bit big like it's a
bit loose on me so if you guys are if
you think you're smaller than me I would
size down I would size down anyways even
if you're not but yeah it looks like
this this is my boob I'm really excited
to wear it
I love this color especially with a 10
I already know that me my sister are
gonna be fighting over the stock sorry
Kayla it's night then the last two tops
I got from Windsor I got this one which
is like a see-through knotted crop top
it's really cool like it came not it I
didn't knock that in the middle so I'm
gonna wear this with like either a
bikini top underneath or a lace bra let
gonna look so cute cannot wait to show
this off then the last time I got is a
simple crop top again high in the front
it's like a crossover and it's just a
black and white simple and the thing
would these tops is that I can wear them
for the rest of the summer and also
layered in the fall it's gonna be so
cute with a leather jacket just picture
that guys then I went to Topshop and I
got only two things because I mean I
have so what many clothing items already
I don't need to buy anymore but I was in
there and I can't leave without buying
anything cuz I have a problem so that's
that's that this is the top it looks
like this I'm sure you guys have all
seen these from Topshop before it's a
baby light sky-blue color and I really
like the color so that's why I bought it
it was on sale for $4 so great steel it
was originally like 10 bucks so you know
on crazy clearance then I got this
extremely cropped t-shirt I owned one
like this from brandy melville last
summer that was like red and white but I
don't know where it went so I got this
it's really cute except for you can't
tell on camera but you're gonna see in
my videos and on Instagram how cool this
is like this goes literally right under
my boobs it's crazy but it's really cute
and I am obsessed with this okay next I
went to Urban Outfitters and I got one
no I got three things but only one
clothing item I picked up a pair of
vintage Levi's shorts because I had made
some of mine like a few years ago
they're complete garbage so I was in
need of one these ones are awesome
they're simple blue and I'm gonna wear
them on the trip
with everything the other two things I
bought were candles I'm obviously not
gonna wear this on the trip but I
figured I'd show you anyways they're
from Urban Outfitters it
the one that's called after late and
wanderlust and don't know how to explain
smells but if you have an urban
outfitters near you go try these scents
they are my two favorite scents in the
entire world if you want to know what my
house or room smells like or what I
smell like this is what I smell like so
you know I wish you guys could smell
through the screen but you can't this
are shopping on shopbot because I love
shop office website like I said before
they ship like this so I got these
shorts from one teaspoon super cute I
mean you guys know I own two other pairs
of shorts like this the blue ones and
the black ones now I own the white ones
so excited to wear this in Sorrento then
I did some shopping on szabo skirt and
if you guys don't know szabo skirt is an
online website from Australia and I love
Australian clothes so I got this simple
brownish and white crop top and it's
like one of those tops that goes like
this whenever they're cold I don't know
super cute this one is actually loose so
it's really cute on it's not like I'm
super tight one so if you don't like the
super tight tops check them out then I
got this top and I feel like this is
totally not everyone's cup of tea but I
love these and it's gonna look so pretty
in Italy so it looks like this it has
like the sleeves that are attached but
it's one of those tops that's like
stretchy like I don't know how to
explain it I love it so much
I actually owned a top like this when I
was in grade 5 so you know throwback to
being nine years old or however old you
are 10 then I got this jumpsuit or play
suit or a romper whatever you want to
call it it looks like this it's white so
it goes like into shorts and at the
bottom it's lace it goes down in the
front and has all these straps in the
back as well it has like all these strap
detailing and it goes quite low in the
back very simple I feel like I'm gonna
wear this out one night in Sorrento or
Amalfi or
or Capri or Pompeii or Rome wherever
we're gonna be I'll wear this thought
one night with a hat and some heels it's
gonna look so cute then this is the last
shirt I got from Salva skirt it looks
like this it's so cute and so different
but I'm obsessed with it I really like
it I think it's super super my style my
taste love the pattern of it oh my god
is that everything oh there's still
another pile just a little warning guys
this is like two months worth of
purchasing or even three months cuz I
haven't done a haul and so long and
these are all things that I was saving
up to show in Sorento because like I get
shipments in sometimes and I'm like what
would this look good with and I think of
the scenery I think of like the outfits
I want to take a thing of the videos and
these are all things I put aside for
Italy but then there's also times where
I go shopping at the mall and I'm like
oh I like this top and then I'm gonna
bring it to Italy anyways anyways I'm
rambling I got this romper thing from
Chula Rosa looks like this it looks like
a dress but these are shorts it's super
cute and has lace and it's probably
really hard to show on camera but this
is the detail and you will see it on my
Instagram and in my video it's so cute
from revolve clothing I got three things
four things that I'm really really
obsessed with so this just came in the
mail the first thing is this is bikini
top I know I just did a bikini
collection but this one I forgot about
so it looks like this and then that ties
around your neck it's very weird but you
will see it in more detail after but
this is the these are the colors it's by
the brand salt swimwear never heard of
them before but I like the colors that's
why I got it
these shorts and they're by lovers and
friends they're white and I'm gonna wear
them high-waisted
and their flowy and pretty and I think
with the crop tops that I got especially
the blue ones gonna look so cute with
some just simple sandals so excited to
wear that then I got this crop top from
for lovin lemons and oh my gosh okay
this is gonna be really hard to show it
looks like this basically it's just like
a cropped bra let but then you have
these two pieces that wrap around your
body anyways this is a really cute top
and you'll see more detail but it has
like little cactus trees and like
flowers and stuff on it and it's light
blue the last thing I got from Rabab
clothing is from 411 lemons and it's the
body suit this is a size small and it's
actually kind of big on me I wish I got
an extra small but I feel like if I got
an extra extra small the chest area
wouldn't fit me but it's still really
cute so it has like it's teal color with
white palm tree leaves all over it and
I'm gonna wear this as a bodysuit with
some with my white shorts I think will
be really cute oh I forgot these shorts
I got these also from Tularosa they're
cute and they remind me of Sorento they
remind me of Italy I don't know why the
last things are from August the labels
so it's Australian brand the first one
is this place suit romper thing looks
like this shorts and then it goes down
in the front I love the color of this
and I'm gonna wear this up for dinner
it's like three-quarter length sleeves
cinches in the waist so it's very
flattering and it goes down in the front
I really like it so that's one the next
is this long maxi skirt it's very high
waisted this is the pattern and it's
very tight except for the end like
flares out a little bit like a mermaid
it's very long it goes all the way to
the floor and it goes very high waisted
but this is the pattern it just has like
navy blue and light pink flowers on it
and the last top is my fave it looks
like this it's long sleeves it's cropped
with a tie so you can make it tight and
these you can wear them across the
shoulders or on top so cute excited to
wear this I'm excited to wear everything
that's about it I'm so excited to wear
all of this this is gonna be a crazy
lookbook okay I don't think I'm gonna
show everything in the lookbook because
that would be like a million outfits but
like Maine really nice pieces I'll show
and if you want to see what everything
else looks like on me you can check out
