Oh
what's up guys I am currently outside
right now which is a little strange but
that is because it's a beautiful day and
I was just enjoying some really fun
snacks and stuff and I've been getting
so many questions from you guys on how
to make like really healthy easy
do-it-yourself summer treats and I have
very big sweet tooth like I do have to
say recently this year I have just been
I don't know I love sweets but at the
same time it's summer you want to stay
healthy on hot days I feel like these
are like the perfect summer treats in my
opinion that I love so much and then I
love to snack on and I make them all the
time for like pool parties and just any
time going over to someone's house super
easy to make make sure you give this
video a big thumbs up let's try and get
it to let's do another challenge let's
try and get this to 9,000 thumbs up I
think that would be so awesome if our
send Tomi's can get to 9000 be so much
fun for those of you wondering cuz I got
a million questions about this these
sunglasses are from key Australia and
this is actually bathing suit top and
it's from revolve clothing so no without
further ado let's just get into the
video this first street is called a
fruit salsa and you'll see what i mean
by that in a second so all you need is
just flour tortillas i'm using gluten
free ones and then sugar mixed with
cinnamon and all you're going to do is
take some melted butter and you're going
to brush that onto your tortilla until
it's completely coated and then what
you're going to do is just place the
tortilla in the cinnamon and sugar and
rub it around until it's fully coated
and do that on both sides
next you're just going to want to slice
your tortillas into little triangles as
if you're cutting a pizza you can
obviously cut them however you like but
I just find that the little triangles
are the best and most fun
once that's all done you're going to
want to pop it into your oven on 350
degrees Fahrenheit for around eight to
ten minutes just until they're crispy
while that's in the oven you're going to
want to get your fruit salsa ready so
here are my favorite fruits to use for
the summertime I love raspberries
blueberries Kiwis and strawberries or my
absolute favorite especially together i
just find it tastes really good so
you're going to want to prepare it into
a very large bowl just pour everything
in and mix it together
once that's all mixed together you're
going to want to pour a little bit of
some organic apricot preserve or apricot
jam whatever you guys want and this just
helps add flavor to the fruit and
sweetness and it looks so good then you
add your sugar tortillas or sugar
cinnamon tortillas and dip it into the
fruit and it's so good guys such a
refreshing treat for the summer and very
good for you and I love this so much
this next dessert is called a fruit
kebab and I'm using some blueberries and
then some like shish kebab sticks or
whatever you call them and some zero
percent fat Greek yogurt vanilla flavor
because it's my favorite all you gotta
do is pour some of the vanilla greek
yogurt onto a plate and then you're
going to start poking the blueberries
onto the stick and just fill them up
completely and then you're going to roll
that in the Greek yogurt
once they're all rolled in the Greek
yogurt i like to scan them up in a
really tall mug and then you're gonna
want to put them in the freezer for
around an hour and then enjoy this last
treat is my absolute favorite it's just
a natural organic popsicle all you need
are Kiwis and watermelon it's the
simplest thing to do ever and I just got
to these like popsicle sticks at the
dollar store so I are going to do is
juice the watermelon and the Kiwi so you
can just use a magic bullet or a blender
for this obviously because there's so
much liquid in the fruit you really
don't need a juicer for this at all
once the watermelon is finished juicing
you don't need to add water or anything
it's literally just the fruit you're
going to pour it into your containers
pop that in the freezer and let it
freeze for around 10 minutes and then
add your Kiwis afterwards
you
once the watermelon is so it hardened
you're going to want to or the QE on top
so that it like layers properly and then
you're going to pop that in the freezer
again and let it freeze for minimum an
hour and then enjoy they're so good so
healthy for you and just literally
tastes like fruit and they're perfect
for right after dinner or something when
you need a quick treat so I hope you
