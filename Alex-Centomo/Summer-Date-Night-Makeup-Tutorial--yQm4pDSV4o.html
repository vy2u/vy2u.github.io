my channel if you guys follow me on
snapchat which you should I mean our
Instagram is kind of like snapchat I
don't which one do you guys prefer
Instagram or snapchat cuz I love the
filters on snapchat better than
Instagram the instagrams fun because I
get to interact with a lot more people
if you guys follow me you will have
known that a few weeks ago I think I
went on a date night with Daniel and I
did my makeup a certain way and everyone
was asking me how I did my makeup and
you guys know that I rarely rarely wear
makeup in the summer but for like
offence or let's say we're on a date
night I love to like glide myself up a
little bit and I'm by no means a makeup
artist but I love to experiment with
makeup and have fun with it so I decided
to do a summer date night makeup
tutorial which it's not really a makeup
tutorial you guys don't have to follow
these steps at all I just thought that I
would show you guys what I did to myself
when I did my makeup I was lucky enough
to partner with L'Oreal to bring you
this video they actually set me three of
their newest products so I kind of
incorporated all my other products with
the three new ones and I'm loving it if
you're interested in seeing how I did
this makeup look then just keep on
watching starting off with a clean face
I always put my hair up when I do my
makeup and then I actually decide to
leave it like this because I thought it
was really cute I'm going into some
foundation making sure that just evenly
spread throughout my face I'm just using
my Beauty Blender to do this and I just
really like the finish that this
foundation gives it's definitely a
medium coverage but I really like the
way that it makes my skin glowy and it
doesn't leave it shiny or anything like
that if ever you need to build up you
can it doesn't look cakey or anything
then going in with my concealer just to
cover up any of the redness or blemishes
that I have
using my new favorite l'oreal infallible
pro contour kit this stuff is amazing
because it comes with the contour and
the highlight and one the contour is
matte it just looks really good and a
highlight as well so I make sure that I
just keep in the 3e section of my face
and sometimes I will do under my bottom
lip as well as on the sides of my nose
but for the most part I keep it kind of
basic where the Sun would naturally hit
your face and then as the highlight I
make sure I keep it on the high points
but if you really want to know on the
actual contour kit it gives you an
explanation with a picture of where to
apply the product which I thought was
really helpful because I followed along
and it looked really really good for
eyeshadow I have been loving this
palette just because there's a lot of
neutral kind of simple tones in it but
they look really really good on green
eyes I find especially but any color
eyes you have it'll look nice I just
have been loving this at the moment so I
kind of mix up shades making sure that I
keep in the creases of my eyes and put
them up on my brow bone a little bit I
was told that since I have such hooded
eyes I said this multiple times because
I've hooded eyes I need to bring the
eyeshadow up more or else if when I open
my eyes you won't see anything because I
have such hooded eyes so I just bring it
up on my brow bone and focus it in the
crease
I then bring some color underneath my
eyes and this is kind of hard to film
believe it or not but I kept going
cross-eyed because I'm like blind but I
really like the way that this looks then
putting some lighter shades on the
center of my lid as well as my brow bone
and inner corners to brighten up the
look and then the most important part of
all is blending because you don't want
it to look harsh or crazy or anything
like that
okay allied this is actually the hardest
thing to film ever because I need to be
super close to a mirror so I actually
had to get up and like go stand in front
of my mirror to be able to put the
eyeliner on because I'm really bad at
filming this and I was going out of
frame but this is how it turned out I
love the wing and I love the way that
this eyeliner looks going in with the
new voluminous butterfly sculpt mascara
this mascara is so cool first of all the
wand is so amazing and so unique and it
just gives your eyelashes the most
fluttery effect ever and I think that's
the whole point of it is that since it's
called like the butterfly's sculpt it's
like fluttery and your eyelashes look so
pretty and long and I love the way it
looks on my eyelashes my eyelashes are
very small naturally so this just makes
them get so big and voluminous
and I just love the effect that it gets
look at that it's so nice
on to the lips I'm using the lab pellet
lip in the nude shades and you can use
any shape you want but the one that I'm
going to be using today I'm actually
gonna do like an ombre so I take the
darker shade I could all around is if
I'm lining my lips and then I take the
one right next to it and I put it on the
outsides of my lips and then the lighter
color I put on the center and this just
makes it like the perfect nude and I've
been trying this out for a little bit
and I love the way it looks the
consistency of this like lip product is
really moisturizing and normally I would
have to apply like a lip liner or a lip
balm or something that like keeps the
color but this stuff I could just use on
its own and it lasts for such a long
time it looks so beautiful and I'm just
obsessed with it at the moment
so this is the finished look I
absolutely love it and I actually really
like wearing my hair up like this too
because it really shows off the makeup
it's like subtle but not really and I
think it's perfect for a day night but
in all reality you can use this makeup
tutorial for anything I just really love
the liner
I love the lips I love the mascara and
contour everything about it is just I
just really like it
so I hope you guys enjoyed it I'm sorry
if I still sound sick because I am I've
had a cold for literally two weeks and
it's the worst thing ever because it's
the summer and all I want to do is be
outside and not sleep but can't do
that's all so let me know in the
comments down below what videos do you
like to see next
I do have back to school videos planned
I don't know when I should start making
them like when do you guys go back to
school because I don't know if I should
do it like last year I did it more near
the end of August like August 20th does
