thinking of all the candy Oh french
fries oh I don't know just all food all
the food what's up guys so I'm really
excited for this video because for one
it is an awesome haul but two it's gonna
be a giveaway another one I know I know
I'm going a little overboard into
giveaways but I can't help it I love
giving back to you guys and I know I'm
doing a lot of fashion giveaways but I
think my next one is gonna be beauty
related so if you guys are interested in
that let me know in the comments below
or if you want more like skincare
haircare let me know I don't know I just
want to do all the good boys just oh
maybe I'll do something even crazier
like give away some kind of I don't know
I was missing something crazy like a
plane but like why would I ever give
away a plane so if you guys didn't know
I have banned well I'm sure you guys
know this but I have been a huge fan of
Windsor since I started my channel they
were like the first company I think I've
ever worked with besides brandy since
like the start beginning beginning of my
youtube kind of career Instagram kind of
career that stuff you know they've
always been there and I love their stuff
but especially for this time of year I
don't know when it is their summer stuff
is just like I'm obsessed I'm always on
the website I'm constantly every month
of getting stuff and I love it so I
figured why don't I give away some of my
favorite items that you have seen before
or some new things that just came out to
you guys because I feel like that would
be awesome
I don't know so I picked out like maybe
10 or you have around 10 articles of
clothing plus a few accessories that are
my absolute favorite things from their
website and I'm going to give them to
you guys so the first thing I picked out
is this because I own like a million of
these tops and like every single color
it's just like a cropped cut out really
cool high neck top obsessive these these
are perfect to wear in the summer
because you can you can pair them with
high-waisted shorts
high-waisted jeans in the fall with a
sweater you know they're so versatile
and it's so cute with a choker plus
black is like just the best color ever
so that is why I got this it's really
nice material very stretchy and sturdy
and soft so that's the first thing I got
it the next thing is I'm sure you guys
will recognize but my new obsession are
these cropped Bambi tops now I have one
of these already but I got another one
for you guys so this is just the one the
same exact one I have but it's brand new
obviously and it's just a simple brand
simple Bambi table I think that's what
they're called because online I always
see Bambi tops so I'm just assuming
that's what it's called so soft has that
this lace and detailing on the edges and
then there's like a string that ties up
the front and it's really nice and I
just I love this and paired with this I
think what I kind of like looked at
outfits that you can wear so with that I
thought that this skirt would be amazing
because first of all the colors of this
maxi skirt are beautiful look at this
look at the colors of this it's a simple
flowy maxi skirt really really flowy
like oh my gosh it's so soft and the
color of this is just it's beautiful
with a 10 and this it's like my style
right there you know so I love this so
much so this is a third thing you guys
will be winning then the next I decide
to get a kimono because you guys all
know I love kimonos and Windsors got
awesome kimonos so this is the one I
picked out because I think this peachy
nude color is so flattering on so many
skin tones so I thought that this would
probably be more versatile for whoever
gets it I think this looks great with
literally anything paired underneath but
especially at something cropped and like
a cropped tank or something with
high-waisted shorts and a bunch of
chunky necklaces and a hat that is my
style when it comes to come
or if you just want to throw this over a
bikini if you're going to a pool or a
beach that's really cute as well white
bikini under this would look so nice and
yeah I really look at details there's
like these little pink flowers on them
and I really like this color the next
thing I picked out was this halter top
and I thought this halter was awesome
because it's like okay this is weird to
say but it's almost like a carpet
material if that makes any sense but I
love structured tops like that and so
it's literally just a halter you tie it
in the back like around your body and
then you tie it around your neck as well
and I love the colors of this because I
think in the summertime this looks so
good when you got just like a bit of a
sunkissed glow to your skin this with
some boyfriend denim jeans or just any
high-waisted jeans would be so cute I
picture myself like wearing something
like this if I'm going to like a beach
party or you know like any kind of event
that you have that you can kind of dress
casual and cute I really picture myself
wearing something like this the next
thing I picked out was this Rolex that
you guys all seem to obsess over on my
Instagram so this is the front and this
is the awesome back if you guys could
see the detail of the strap enos of this
I think this is so cute with
high-waisted shorts if you're not
comfortable wearing just the bralette
with shorts you can pair it with a
really baggy tank top underneath that is
like super baggy in the back because
then you can really see the detail of
the straps I think it's so cute or an
open-back top would look really nice
with this as well so I got white because
it's summer and I have the white one as
well
love the white they also have black I
think and I don't know if they have add
other colors but white - my favorite
when it comes to that the next thing and
I'm obsessed with this because of so
many different reasons but it's this
dress for one look at this color guys
look how bright that is this is gorgeous
I am so obsessed with this love the
neckline you guys know I'm obsessed with
these like
hi necklines that go kind of like this I
don't know what that's called you guys
know that's called cuz I have no idea
but it's just a simple indigo blue dress
it's I guess it goes like mid sigh well
for me it would go mid fine it depends
how tall you are I'm pretty tall and 5/8
full it's not pretty tall but I'm 5/8 so
for some people it might go to your knee
but there's a little thing in the waist
you know kind of hold it in place and
the back is open but then it pins at the
top so you could see it a little bit of
the back and I think it's super
flattering guys this for the 4th of July
like if you have like a fourth of July
dinner how cute would that be I think
this is awesome oh and it's like that
material that doesn't wrinkle really so
you will have to worry about it really
wrinkling love it the next dress I
picked up for you guys is so gorgeous as
well it's this long maxi dress like all
the way to the floor these colors are
stunning look at these and I really like
it because the front has so much details
like this crochet thing on top and it's
super open in the front you guys know
how I love me my open tops and the back
is quite low down and then you have this
tropic thing as well that you can tie up
here if you want to make the straps
tighter or whatever but I think this
color is so beautiful I was just I kept
getting drawn to it when I was on the
website and I was like you know what
like I need to get this I'm actually
probably gonna ask for the same exact
one because I'm so obsessed with this oh
it's so beautiful and it's maxi and it's
just long and
I don't know how you guys feel about
maxi dresses but I'm all for them so the
next dress I got for you guys is this
one it's just a cream dress it looks
like this it really reminds me of those
bratty dresses because of the back so
you see how it's like open back and then
they have this strap here it really
reminds me of that brandy dress and I
own a few like that and this one is so
beautiful because it's cream and it's
lace so you have this like really really
gorgeous detail over the front of and
like the back of the dress as well but
it's still casual so you don't have to
like you could wear this too you know
like just a lunch date or something but
you can also dress it up with necklaces
and some nice heels and wear it out
because it's so versatile and I really
like this color for the winter I mean
for the summer it's flowy you can spin
it it will spin around it'll be so
pretty
um so weird oh also I'm wearing a winter
topper right now if you couldn't tell
the next thing I got is this super cute
crochet scarf or a shawl whatever you
guys want it to be it's just something
you can throw on to add texture to any
outfit I know I thought it was really
cute and I love the crochet detail of
this I think it's so flattering have a
wrapped around or if it gets a little
chilly you can throw it over your
shoulders and have it like by the water
and you're just kind of with your date
your BAE or your best friend or if
you're alone with Netflix you can still
do it you know what I'm saying so this
is really cute I like this I was very
drawn to it okay and the last two things
I'm really excited about because I know
you guys are gonna love this but this
statement necklace oh my gosh you guys
you guys know I own this already in like
two different colors I own the silver
one and the copper tone one but the
silver one is by far my favorite
very jiggly love to layer this with any
kind of simple top simple dress you can
really just like dress it up or you can
really just amp it up with this necklace
honestly goes with so many things I
catch myself wearing it all the time so
I thought like I couldn't do a Windsor
giveaway without including this and then
the last thing which I don't know if
this is everyone's favorite but I'm
definitely into this trend are fake
septum cuffs so you guys know I love me
my little fake septum nose ring from
three people I also have a gold one from
Windsor as well now and they just came
out with this one which is so cute it's
a gray not great it's a silver Septon
cup with a bit of a detail on top so you
guys if you don't feel comfortable
wearing this you totally don't have to
wear it you know don't do something
because it's trying to do it because you
like it but I really like that trend but
I don't feel like getting that piercing
pierced because for one I probably
wouldn't like it like all the time it's
just for certain outfits I like it so
it's kind of what it would be a waste of
money for me and these are like really
inexpensive so go for it so I hope you
guys enjoyed this haul slash giveaway
and I'm gonna explain the rules now
obviously because kind of a giveaway
without rules first rule is you must be
subscribed to my channel the one you're
watching right now because it's my
giveaway so duh second rule of course is
you have to be following windsor on
instagram twitter and snapchat now they
just came out with their snapchat not
too long ago and it's actually really
fun to follow them because they do a lot
of behind the scenes of their shoots and
stuff like they just had their nautical
line so they're filming like on a boat
and stuff it was so cool to see like
behind the scenes of how a shoot works
kind of like what I did for them in
California for Coachella but you would
see that more often because they always
film it on their snapchat so you must be
following those three things I will have
all the rules listed down below if you
guys forgot and I will announce the
winner in one week from today I will be
announcing it on my second Instagram
account my personal one who the eff is
Alex so if you guys want to follow me
there as well
but I love you guys all so much make
sure you let me know in the comments if
you have entered and go comment on
Windsor's pictures on instagram letting
them know that you've entered my
giveaway as well so they can see and
yeah i love you guys all so much and I
will see you all in the next videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
