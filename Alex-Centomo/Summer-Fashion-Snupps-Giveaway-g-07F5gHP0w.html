just Alex
you want to follow me if any of you guys
use Instagram you will be able to use
this app no problem it's very very
similar super easy and very fun to use
so now that that's been clear let's move
on to what you can be winning I'm going
to start off with brandy melville
because you guys all love brandy
melville so the first thing that you
guys will be winning if I can open it is
this top so oh my gosh okay what is this
this is like a cropped kind of ribbed
tank top that crosses in the back so
it's kind of an open back and it crosses
and the front as crosses as well this is
very hard to see what it looks like but
there are so many pictures of this on
the website it's very cute it's black
super stretchy and comfortable love this
top so much the next thing is this
cropped three-quarter length sleeve very
loose soft thin material um t-shirt or
shirt it's just thin stripes so so
freaking cute I love wearing this with
high waisted jean shorts or high-waisted
black jeans with rips in the knees or
rips all over I think it's super cute
with a choker like this it's a bit of a
bigger neckline so it's really
flattering around this area I really
like this a lot and i'm very jealous oh
you guys are getting this because i love
this next t-shirt from brandi is this
one right here so this is a simple gray
loose t-shirt with a very big neckline
but it's kind of cropped a little bit um
and it's the softest material in the
entire world as you know Brandi tops are
very soft but this is like it feels like
air it's literally air so this is the
next top you guys will be winning then
the one after that ok this top reminds
me of when I was a kid but it's so in
right now and I'm so excited about it so
it is this top right here it's like an
off-the-shoulder crop top it reminds me
of something kendall Jenner would wear
and it's very stretchy it's tight but
it's like very stretchy and I think this
is so flattering my sister is obsessed
with this top so lucky you guys are
winning it it looks very tiny but I
swear it's like the stretchy really like
it's so nice so that is the last thing
you will be winning from
d now on to Windsor have a few wins or
items for you guys so the first thing is
going to be this item right here um this
is something me a while ago but I
actually never ended up wearing it and I
own like three t-shirts like this
already I'm kind of sad to give it away
because it's really nice but I think you
guys will probably get better use of it
rather than me because I have things
that are like exactly the same it's just
a simple denim vest kind of top you can
wear this as a top on its own with like
the button or you can undo the buttons
and wear it over a crop top I think
that's super cute cuz like bests are so
in right now and this is just really
flattering with a tan I think this
opened up with a like simple white crop
top and some black high-waisted jeans
would be so cute and like some really
cute sneakers love that kind of look so
this is the next thing you will be
winning and I have it to come onus for
you guys because of course it's summer
and I can't have a giveaway without
giving away kimonos now these kimonos
are really really good quality and I'm
obsessed with them they're like the
coachella mo nose so I'm very excited
about it the first one I own this exact
one already so we're going to be twins
with this but this is the kimono as you
remember from my Instagram account it
looks like this there's fringe on the
arms and at the bottom it's not like a
super long kimono it probably goes
around mid side goes with anything to be
honest and I think this even just draped
over like a black bikini is so cute and
I'm a huge sucker for kimonos in the
summertime I wear them all the time then
the next kimono I have is another one
but you guys will recognize this one
here which is a sleeveless kimono which
is so flattering guys with like a white
dress obsessed how's this lace detailing
on top and then it's floral and this one
is very long like this one goes almost
all the way down to the floor so
beautiful so nice they're really really
good quality i find windsor kimonos for
some reason I don't know
what they use but they last so long and
they're very very soft and they just
like you can kind of bunch it all up and
put in your suitcase or in your bag and
they never wrinkle which is such a plus
for me because I hate having wrinkled
clothes so that is one other thing that
I think you guys will love and the
colors or gorgeous you know this was
just like a simple short white dress
underneath and like some gladiator
sandals or something at you know a
summer picnic or whatever is so
incredibly cute I think I said I'm
credibly instead of incredibly weird
then the next thing that which I know
you guys will love because it's so
beautiful it's from an australian brand
and it is this top right here how cute
is this so i would wear this with high
waisted jean shorts and one of those
kimonos how cute would that be and like
a hat oh I love that so much I mean you
can wear this as a crop underneath
cropped t-shirt with the this place part
hanging out or you can just wear it on
its own whatever you guys like so
beautiful and then in the back there's
just a zipper to kind of put together so
that's a plus because I hate having
wando's they have to like pull over your
head because then you get makeup all
over it especially if it's white so it's
great to have a zipper love that detail
then the next thing you guys will be
winning is this striped quarter length
sleeve top from what's company it's
called usually or jolly however you want
to say it and you guys know my obsession
with stripes plus this material is super
super soft and flattering it's a little
bit more structured it really reminds me
of something that you would get at
madewell and I like the color of it it's
beige with black stripes can't go wrong
with that and I think that having a kind
of longer shirt for summer is kind of a
must because especially on cooler days
or if it's windy or you know in the
evenings when it starts to get a bit
cooler it's so great to have something
like this with jean shorts I think it
looks super cute so that is all for the
fashion giveaway items and now for the
beauty giveaway I'm so excited for this
guy's because look at what you'll be
winning this huge box of elf cosmetics
