sister sister from the same mister today
I wanted to film a video with Kyla
because we have been getting usually all
the time but lately especially so many
new followers on Instagram and on
YouTube and stuff and we get a lot of
questions about our hair I know
especially for me do you get a lot of
persons about yes yeah it's like the
main question for me is like my hair and
my tan in my pictures so it's like I did
how I self tan video and I've done
haircare routine videos before and
actually did one in the like winter on
how to grow your hair longer like my
tips and tricks but I haven't done an
updated haircare routine in quite a
while and because I have so many new
viewers I figured that I would just kind
of you know explain some more and have
Kyla here with me too because honestly
like to be straight with you guys
I get majority of my tips from her
because I kind of was following the
steps that she did to get like her
beautiful healthy long hair by the way
this is all real so many people think
that my hair is only extensions but this
is because we do we do wear extensions
too like if I want to make my hair well
for me it's it's like length and volume
hers her extensions are like basically
the same length as your hair volume for
my hair yeah so like we do promote
extensions and stuff and we do like
wearing extensions it makes your braids
look thicker it makes your hair look
thicker if you're doing a photo shoot
you're going out for dinner going out
with nothing wrong with clip-ins yeah
it's fine you know once in a while just
make your hair like super voluptuous but
I also like the fact especially now I
was just saying this to Kyla that I can
go out in public with my natural hair
and I like when you're going to Taylor
Swift to the other like last night two
nights ago nights ago I was looking at
is like oh my gosh her hair got so much
longer
hey I mean I do need to trim it you guys
like this probably not the best time to
like do this video because it's quite
dead at the ends long intro let's just
get into some like tips and tricks okay
so I'm gonna start off with like some of
the tools and tricks I did to get long
hair like this the first thing that I
did that's like I might want to swallow
but like I didn't go down all the way
chokes OH
the number one thing that I did that was
probably the best thing for me it was
not applying any heat to my hair
whatsoever so I started growing it or
like wanting to grow it summer of 2013
so I was like exactly two years ago a
little over two years ago and it was my
hair was probably like up to here just
above my boobs yeah and um it like I
didn't apply any heat to it for like the
first full year that I was in university
the only times I've ever put heat in my
hair was if I was going out and that's
very rare so probably the entire year I
plot I applied heat to it like twice Wow
yeah it was like or like if you had a
fancy dinner like Christmas or something
but yeah yeah yeah but like even at that
like a lot of times I was just like had
it up in a ponytail I put hairspray or
like I just had it like matcha badly
she's so like tie your hair like tight
back in a high ponytail yeah hairspray
hey I still do that but like I stood all
the time because it was like no it still
looked good but like no heat applied in
my hair especially the ends it did take
like two years to get this line so like
it took a really long time and I I look
another thing I did was like I would
never go to the hairdresser first of all
like I mean I'm sorry if your
hairdresser but you guys cut way too
much off know like even although like we
promise we won't but it's like half my
hair is gone yeah so that's how I think
I never watched a hairdressers and I
would just trim my hair like I never did
layers in my hair at the time and I
would just trim like an inch off my hair
like when it's not much when it was wet
and I would do that like once every two
or three months like I would still let
it grow and like you never really
noticed that much
you cut it Oh disclaimer this is what
works for us not saying that if you do
these things it will work I mean it
works for us our hair type maybe I don't
know if you won't like super curly hair
that doesn't grow as fast it might not
work the same this is just what works
for us we have the exact same type of
yeah we do and then the third main thing
I did was I never dyed my hair now
recently I applied some blonde at the
bottom but at the time it was just like
this color a period just natural
I used to dye my hair all the time I've
said this before multiple videos for
those of you that followed me for a long
time you do know that I used to have my
blonde down here was everywhere like I
had bleached blonde hair I look back on
pictures and I cringe but at the time it
was like nice you know like people liked
it but what I decided to do was I wanted
Umbra hair but I figured instead of hey
okay cute instead of paying to get ombre
hair where they're not probably not
gonna be able to dye my the top a dark
color that matches my roots exactly
because I didn't have my roots weren't
growing out at the time and I just knew
it wasn't gonna match perfectly but I
said like why don't I just start letting
my blonde grow out because the way my
dye was it would kind of start fading a
little bit like it wasn't so intense
like near the end I wouldn't bleach it I
would just get streaks so it was able to
kind of blend and if you have been
following me on instagram since I first
started like really early on when I
first started working for brandy
melville you know that like my roots my
already started like here like it was
almost all on yeah if you go back to my
old brandy pictures like if you scroll
down my Instagram really far you'll see
the progression yeah and my hair was
like here like I had just touched my
collarbones and if you watch my old
videos it's so funny your hair was still
blonde like my hair was still blonde and
I had put it in a braid and my braid was
like this skinny cuz I had like no hair
and it was like up to here like I did
the boyfriend tag with Daniel and it was
like that and cuz my hair was so dead I
used to strain it all time curl it every
single day diet like it was so I wanted
for that so I decided for that whole
summer I was just going to keep my hair
natural so what I would do is I would
get out of the shower I would put my
hair into
days until it was maybe like 70% dry
take them out of the braids and use sea
salt spray and it would be like very
like beachy texture and because my hair
was shorter it was more like all over
and everyone on Instagram seemed to love
it so it made me feel more confident
knowing that like people liked my hair
because I used to be very self-conscious
over my hair I used to think it was like
really gross so that's what I started
doing for that whole summer and then I
started using extensions a lot
throughout the winter and I would curl
my hair sometimes but not that much but
like like a lot less than I used to but
I still would do it once in a while for
photo shoots and stuff and then last
summer I started um like a comp not a
competition but like a goal with you
guys if you remember from last summer
that we weren't gonna use heat in her
hair the whole summer and I didn't and
it was awesome and I'm actually able to
do curls in my hair with no heat if you
guys are interested in seeing my no-heat
curls tutorial I leave a link down below
it's really simple and it gave me like
super nice curls that happened my hair
started growing I mean I did kind of do
a big cut at the end of last summer like
my hair did get quite long and I cut off
a lot cuz it was just like so dead since
I hadn't cut it like all year was really
bad I didn't cut it for like a full year
when I did coming here I was using the
extensions a lot more to kind of give
fullness and link to my hair for my
Instagram pictures because my old
Instagram pictures I used to use
extensions all the time like for my
braids every single picture was
extensions like I just really liked that
look of it you know and then throughout
maybe since February of this year I
haven't been using extensions as much
like I would do it for one shoot for
that month and then kind of like every
other picture I know it's sorry I'm
sorry oh my god I'm so boring that you
just fall asleep I really care about
what you're saying
stop you're joking I am joking
this is gonna be such a Rob leave your
little bit less I could come back a
little bit but yeah basically in all my
pictures on Instagram now unless I'm
like putting extensions in my hair it's
all natural like and I don't use Eddie
I haven't used heat in months like I
remember the last time I use heat when I
usually curl my hair for pictures I'll
do the no heat tutorial like I literally
it's crazy and my hair has grown so much
and it not only is it like longer it's
so much healthier and I have so much
more of it like I'm telling you guys can
see like from my old videos like
literally go back and stock my old
videos they're very embarrassing but you
will see how disgustingly dead and thin
my hair wasn't it looked like I had no
hair and then all of a sudden it's like
feel it it's like so much thicker now
you know like I have like yeah very fine
hair so I have a lot of hair but it's
very fine so it's not thick hair but
it's looking more full now because it's
so much healthier and I'm due for a trim
because it's been around 3 months oh
yeah and my ombre is literally naturally
ombre like I let my hair grow out until
January I got a bit more balayage put in
there because my palm bro is almost
completely out if you guys remember but
that was the first time I dyed my hair
in like three years
and it wasn't much like it was only a
few strands like me hearing stuff you
know and then also when it comes to
another tip for me is I don't wash my
hair got often I literally wash my hair
once a week you know I was doing that
too actually no not once a week once
every like 2 or 3 days and people always
ask me like Alex you work out every
single day like how do you survive at
the beginning if my hair would get
greasy in like a day like I wash my hair
and by the end the day my hair is greasy
like that's literally how it was for me
and I would get so subconscious that I
would just wash my hair then obviously I
discovered dry shampoo and that worked
for a bit but my hair would still like I
didn't like the feeling of it and like
it would still can't get kind of greasy
by like the next day so I was just end
up washing it then I really forced
myself to like not care if my hair was
greasy
I just like wear how to put in a bun or
like whatever and after doing that it's
been like 2 years now and I'm able to go
5 days about my hair looking greasy and
I work out every single day and I shred
sure by like the last day that's when
your hair yeah it's weird like I'll
sweat but then like it's not like grease
I know I'll shower every day
or I'll take a bath but mainly I shower
with my lawn
today it doesn't look Christian I put a
little bit of dry shampoo because like
it's on the fourth day now so - really
yeah but that's because I really pushed
it for so long I just kept I was just
like whatever like I don't care if my
hair is greasy I'm gonna go out hobli
hair does not look greasy at all at all
and the less amount of heat less amount
of products you put in your hair less
amount of times you wash it lesson on a
dye basically the last work it was a
list the less work the more your hair
will grow yes I don't know no I know
this video might seem a bit repetitive
because I've done it before but I want
it crowd of you here because I basically
got my tips from her so if you like this
video give it a thumbs up bye just to
quickly talk about the extensions that I
actually use I've shown these so many
times I've got Instagram and stuff but
because like I said I'm getting so many
new viewers I want to show them they're
an ombre set so they're they literally
match my hair exactly they're a little
bit dark for my roots right now because
the Sun makes my roots a lot lighter in
the summertime but these are perfect for
me in the winter because this is my
color in the winter but it's not like
that big of a difference I go you can
see it blends perfectly and the bottoms
are very like similar to my bottoms and
I just like them because you can see at
the bottom they're thick and they're
like straight so it makes your hair like
full of healthy yeah so these are foxy
locks extensions they're like the 24
inch I think it's um 18 grams
so no I'm trying to think of the name of
it I forget the name because I know my
old ones were sandy blonde but this is
the ombre set I forget the name of it I
always say if that's sandy blonde but
it's not I'll leave a link down below
with the like exact ones but you can go
on the website anyways and like see
Ayanna she's always asking me for my
hair color I mean maybe it's not the
best that I mentioned
mentioning it in this video but I have
the hombre tough hombre hombre ombre
ombre ombre hombre tomato tomahto yeah I
guess um yeah she is toffee I have I
forget the name of it but yeah
Oh also I was afraid to tell you guys
this but I have like a discount code
that you can use if you do decide to buy
foxy locks I'll leave it down below and
you guys can get like a little discount
if you use that code yeah no I just
really like them like I say in every
video like they they're not sponsoring
this video by the way guys like I'm
literally just showing this to you
because we're talking about extensions
there have so many like a huge variety
of colors and stuff and I'm always open
to like trying out new things and
testing out different extensions and
stuff because it's fun you know it's
real like hair you can style them you
can wash them the less you wash them
