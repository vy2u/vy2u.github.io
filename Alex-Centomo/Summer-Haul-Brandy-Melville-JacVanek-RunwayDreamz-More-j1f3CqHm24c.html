filming my summer haul video I know you
guys have been asking for this for a
long time but I wanted to give some time
between my spring haul and my summer
haul before I showed you the new stuff I
got for the summertime I have been
shopping so much lately it's really bad
and I know and all of my pictures on
Instagram you guys always ask where the
eggs are from but just FYI it's always
listed in the description or I tag the
companies in the picture so if ever
you're wondering where I got anything
it's usually just in the description or
tagged in the pictures you can just tap
the photo to see where I got everything
but of all a lot of you guys wanted me
to kind of explain how I like some of
the items so I figured that this is a
good way to show you so this is a
collective haul because I did not
purchase these items all at once it's
been throughout a couple months but yeah
I have specifically bought items like
for the summer so I guess let's just get
into it starting off I guess with my
jewelry because I'm wearing two new
pieces right now these like choker kind
of necklaces I've been obsessed with
lately I know you guys have seen from my
Instagram I've just wanted really good
chokers so I actually found this company
on Instagram and they're called
pneumatic store and they have like the
best chokers I see a bunch of girls from
YouTube wearing these kind of necklaces
and they're basically like simple black
bands with a little gemstone on them so
I got an elephant and then on this one I
got like a little light pink gemstone
kind of thing and I just really think
they're simple they're very easy to wear
they have an adjustable strap so you can
if you have a smaller or bigger neck you
can adjust it to the size like these are
the same sides that I just made this one
bigger to kind of hang lower but this
one I want it to be more of a good Joker
style necklace and they also have like
different like small chains and
different sort of necklaces so I just
like to get these two because I really
like them as well as this one here which
is basically just like the classic 90s
tattoo style stretchy choker but on the
outside of it there's a little charm and
it is a planet so it's actually Saturn
and I just
like it's super tiny it's very dainty
and I like wearing this with like my 90s
inspired grungy items so any kind of
like crop top or top that goes like this
or you know the flannel tight around the
waist is just so cool and so my style so
I'm just really excited to have found
this store I will link their Instagram
my website down below if you guys are
interested in checking them out and let
me know if you like them because I think
their stuff is pretty awesome
moving on to bracelets a lot of you guys
have been asking me where I get these
kind of like braided bracelets and
they're actually from pair of ADA
bracelets I don't know if I pronounced
that right / Evita pura vida'
it's just a really cool company they
have a bunch of like handmade bracelets
that are adjustable so you actually just
like pull the string here to make them
tighter or looser and some of them have
charms on them some of them are just
braided and the really cool classic
summer bracelets so I wear these a lot
in the summertime they're just really
nice I went to the amusement park the
other day and I got asked a bunch of
times from people like where I got these
bracelets so that's where they're from
and as well as these little elastics you
guys always ask me where I get these
sort of like ribbon elastics and I
prefer these elastics so much better
than regular ones because I find my
names like the old-fashioned hair ties
it weaves crinks in my hair and stuff
whereas when I use these to put my hair
up it never leaves a mark and they're
really pretty it looks like I'm just
wearing a ribbon in my hair and I just
have them on like this little thing to
keep them in place I have one of my
wrists right now I just really like them
a lot I'll link everything down below
okay guys so if ever you're interested
in whatever I'm showing you it will be
linked down below the item as well as
the website so they're easy
the last jeweler item of course is this
new bracelet I got from by Melanie
archer you guys know I love the
bracelets that she makes this one has a
little starfish on it which i think is
so cute and of course it's turquoise my
favorite color and I love pairing these
or let my pyramid of bracelets or
anything like that I think it's so nice
and so nice with a tad off this colors
just so pretty so yeah definitely check
out her website down below she just came
out with a new collection
they're so beautiful oh my gosh guys
like I cannot wait to get one
there's like these different gemstones
on them and stuff on they're just really
cool and totally my style so definitely
check them out down below okay onto
clothing because you guys all know that
I'm so some clothing let's just get
right into it so I have been a huge fan
of Jack panic for a long time I have
been obsessed with her work if you don't
know who she is she is a kind of urban
designer she sells a lot of her clothing
at Urban Outfitters and I've I think I
found her on tumblr like years ago just
some of her pictures someone was wearing
a jacket like an army green jacket that
said I hate everyone and I thought it
was so funny and I was searching for her
for so long finally I found her stuff I
bought like I think I bought out
everything that she was selling at the
time at Urban Outfitters and a lot of
the time last summer I would wear her
stuff so I just like to do a big
purchase from her because I really like
a lot of her stuff first thing that I
got from her
is this like muscle tee like oversized
muscle tees that's my favorite thing are
the oversized muscle tees because I
really like when they're like big on the
slides and they could show off a lot of
skin and if you're wearing a nice bra
let I think it's so nice so I got this
one is the first one says shredding a
tidal wave of whiskey on a surfboard
made out of I don't care and I just
think it's really funny yeah I didn't
own any black kind of muscle tee or
graphics so I thought this one was
really cool the next one is this tie-dye
one it's the same style of shirt and I'm
really into tie-dye lately and this one
says ocean air salty hair not a care
take me there so this is perfect for me
because as you guys all know I'm
obsessed with like the beach and stuff
and I just think her graphics are really
funny I wore this I think like three
times last week and then this next one
is actually my favorite just because of
the colors I just think they're so nice
it's the exact same style shirt again
the muscle team as you could tell that's
probably one of my favorite style tees
at the moment and it says aloha bitches
so I'm sorry you guys are young you
don't like swear words but I really like
this it's just like a really nice pastel
blueish color with like a really cool
pink and I just really like it a lot
now the next one I'm sure you guys all
love already because I
my Instagram and everyone obsessed over
it and it's the one that says I love you
more than Pizza and then the pizza is
written in like pizza and this one's
actually just an oversized T so it has
sleeves and it's an off-white color so
it's super nice from your tent and I
love lodging around this at home oh my
gosh guys like Jack manic is like all I
wear at home because it's so comfortable
it's so oversized and big so the next
one is actually a different style
t-shirt
it's a cropped t-shirt and it has a
little rainbow on it and on like the
little clouds on the sides it says it's
not me it's you so opposite of what
people normally say when they break up
it's not you it's me it's not me it's
you sorry to say I love wearing this
with high-waisted shorts I just think
it's so comfortable and I really like it
a lot
the last graphic I have from her I'm
sorry I'm sure you guys everything from
her just because I'm just so obsessed
with it and it says need more sleep with
a sad face and this is so appropriate
for me because I have insomnia I've
struggled insomnia and I wake up at like
5:00 a.m. or 6 a.m. every morning and
then I go to work and I'm just like
dying at work so yeah I need more sleep
it's very appropriate I like to wear it
on Monday because everyone's tired on
Monday and again this is just like the
oversize muscle team now the next thing
that I got is actually this kimono and
it looks like this it's really long and
it has like tassels on the sleeves and
on the bottom and I just think it's such
a cool color so nice with my skin tone
and my hair I'm just obsessed with
kimonos right now so this is perfect for
me the next thing I got from her is by
far my favorite thing ever it's this
flannel and it just has like such nice
colors these are my favorite colors for
a flannel I just love it so much so much
it's pretty baggy and on the back is my
favorite because it says music is the
answer and I do think music is the
answer I'm a huge fan of music and I
just think it's the answer for
everything if you're upset listen to
music it makes you feel better so I
don't know I just think that this is
like such an amazing flannel I like to
wear it like tied around my waist and
then this like
it goes over the butt and it's see and
you see like says music is the answer I
actually wore it in my summer get ready
with me video okay so the last thing I
got is this really oversized army jacket
and this is gonna be perfect for the
fall time I'm so excited to rock this
with like some leggings and some really
cool Doc Martens I think it's awesome on
the sleeves there's just like this I
think it's like a Fran swag and then I
think there's the other it's like
another military sign thing on this side
of the jacket and then the best part is
the back and it's the classic I hate
every one which you know I don't hate
every one but I just think it's so funny
I mean my friends it's like an inside
joke with us and we were just like oh I
hate everyone when you're just like in a
bad mood or something so I just think
it's really cool I'm excited to wear
this in the fall time I'll definitely
have a lot of outfit posts with it so be
ready for that okay now before I move on
I want you guys to know that Jack
fennecs actually starting her YouTube
channel again so I will link her channel
down below please go give her some love
go subscribe you'll see like a bunch of
her old videos cuz she I guess needs to
make videos back in the day but now she
wants to start making more videos so
please go get some love and tell her
that I sent you and also let me know in
the comments if you like her stuff as
well so the next thing of course our
runway dreams shorts you guys always ask
me to show you my runway dream shorts I
actually only have four pairs because
they are quite pricey but I really
really love the way they fit on my body
I just like the way that how
high-waisted they are and they show a
lot of your legs I have very long legs
so I like to show off how long my legs
are and also I have friends that have
shorter legs but it extends the leg so
if you do have shorter legs and you want
shorts to make it legs look longer run
my dreams are perfect cuz the way
there's style they'll show you the first
pair are my absolute favorite and it's
the keeper stone wash the keepers and
the darker ones and so as you can see on
this side of the shorts actually I don't
know if I'm able to see in the video but
I mean I have tons of pictures on my
Instagram they actually go up on the
side so it shows more of the leg so it
really extends your leg and this are
super high-waisted it just look like
and then in the back there like that
pretty simple I just like the distressed
look at them they're like my favorite
color and jean shorts i love jean shorts
that it was colored and then in the same
exact shorts i got the lighter blue ones
as well i don't know if they'll be able
to pick up my camera but they're the
exact same ones just in a light wash the
back is the same they're high-waisted
their super comfortable and then i got
this pair as well and they're more
distressed in the pockets but what i
like about them is they actually have
these stud detailing on the pocket right
here and then the back kind of looks the
same with a little distressed on the
pocket and i like these ones because the
pockets gonna hang out which is really
cool and i don't know i really like also
the way that they're made they have like
buttons that go all down the side all
down the front it's not like a zipper I
just think it's unique the last pair are
these ones and these are actually
different they're acid-wash they're not
high-waisted they kind of sit more on
your your waist so not super
high-waisted but not low waisted either
but these are like really high on the
side they're super nice and these ones
to have this studying detailing right
here the back just looks like this and I
think these are super cool and very
unique no one has shorts like these so I
wear them around and people who orgy of
those yeah I just I like wearing stuff
that's very different unique I don't
like to wear things that like a lot of
people have I know it sounds weird
because I own a lot of stuff from Brandi
but I feel like Brandis very basic and I
love basic clothing as well so if it's
just like basic clothing it's not a big
issue but when it comes to like
statement pieces I like things that are
very different you know most people
won't have so the next thing is Brandi
and it's actually just one item and it's
this shirt it's just a basic shirt is
long-sleeve and it's so soft and very
stretchy and what I like about it is the
front cuz it has like these or is it
yeah these like buttons right here and
it looks like an oversized boyfriend
t-shirt so I just think it's really cool
it's it's like off the shoulders kind of
I have a picture on my Instagram if you
guys are curious
kind of crop so I wear it with some
boyfriend jean shorts but I just think
it's like the best oh my gosh guys Brad
he's so soft this is kind of like a
grayish blueish color I don't know if it
will pick up on camera but it has
definitely some blue threading in here
some like navy blue threading which i
think is super nice now the next thing I
got is actually from an online store and
it's called Arnhem clothing and the
stuff is very unique like I'm saying
it's very different but I think it's so
nice they have so many kimonos and
rompers and t-shirts it's so beautiful
but I picked up this romper check this
out guys look at the colors on this oh
my gosh it's like three-quarter length
sleeves and look at the detailing on the
front here and then it has this like
drawstring with like little tassels on
it right here and the bottom is like my
favorite kind of seafoam green color
with the orange it's so nice on with a
10 and the green in the shirt really
makes my eyes pop so I decided on this
one but I just think it's so beautiful
I've been waiting to style it properly
to post on my Instagram but I'm just
absolutely obsessed with this item I
could not be happier it's so nice my
sister actually wore it too because
we're both obsessed with it she worked
to a concert and with really nice like
neon blue heels it was so cool and so
nice she got so many compliments on it
so definitely recommend arnhem clothing
check them out down below now the last
thing I'm gonna show you guys cuz I
don't this video to be like 30 minutes
long it's this kimono from Windsor and
this is kind of similar colors to like
the thing I just showed you it's like a
burnt orange / red kind of kimono I've
shown something on my Instagram before
and you guys have seem to love it I just
think it's so flattering for the
summertime I just love it so much and
it's long so it goes past my hips and
almost all the way down to my knees we
should really like and then the sleeves
kind of go all the way to my elbows
which is super sweet and I love wearing
this with a black crop top and
high-waisted shorts and like a really
big statement necklace I was so happy
when I open this from Windsor
like oh my gosh this is beautiful so
that is not it for my haul I'm not too
sure if you guys really like hauls or
not you seem to like my spring haul part
1 in part 2 but I do shop quite often I
don't know if you guys want me to post
hauls that often so let me know in the
comments below if you want to see more
hauls because I have so many things to
show you I just don't want the videos to
be like 40 minutes long so if you really
like hauls and you want me to go into
detail with like the things I get and
why I get them and see more about my
style then let me know in the comments
down below I actually want to ask you
guys for the summertime which you guys
want me to start uploading two times a
week and what days would you want me to
upload I like keeping my weekend day on
Saturday I think it's a really good day
because most people are free to watch
videos on Saturday and it's also just
convenient for me but during the week
what day would you want like Wednesday
at Tuesday at Thursday let me know in
the comments below because I want to
start uploading more frequently because
you guys always tweet me and you're
always like I'm so soft a wait a full
week for you to post your new video

mean maybe if you do like during the
week a small little video and then the
weekends can be for like my big edited
