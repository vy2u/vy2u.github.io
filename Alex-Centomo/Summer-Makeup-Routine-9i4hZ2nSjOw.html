different right now because I'm holding
my camera but if you guys don't know I
have a second channel where I vlog like
every single week and I post weekly
vlogs and every time I travel I post
well I post vlogs from there and I get
so many questions about how I do my
makeup in the summer now I don't wear
makeup all the time I wear them normally
for either events or if I have like a
fancy dinner or something I don't
usually wear makeup throughout the day
but when I do wear makeup this is what I
usually do and I get an overwhelming
amount of questions on how I do it so I
figured I'll just sit down and show you
guys how I do my makeup and this is
normally what it looks like when I'm
holding my handheld camera very simple
very dewy it doesn't matter which which
foundation you use or if you use a BB
cream or whatever it takes me like 5
minutes to do my makeup tops and I know
this is like the lazy way but I love
doing the makeup like this I think it's
just like simple and dewy and summery
and it's perfect for this time of year
so if you want to see how I do my makeup
and keep on watching and the reason why
I'm using this camera today and not my
big one it's because I want to show you
guys the effect that it shows in my
blogs and this is what I'm gonna be
doing I quickly also wanted to say that
this is the foundation that I use I
didn't show it in the video because I
had already done my foundation for the
day but you guys have seen me do my
foundation so many times so I just
figured like why would I need to show
you again but it's just this one from
Too Faced it's called Born This Way it's
anyone and I picked it up because I
needed one to match my skin and I really
really really enjoy it so let's get into
the video
I feel that we are controlling our
bodies might get perfect in your eyes
you can't make me sweat
we will always be assuming fragile we
can smoke over a did most Collier to me
I'm holding on but my body's caving in
call it out to me I knew of one but it
do me anything it's behind me it's
fighting me so I wait till morning car
honey bear
Holly fair
ha
since we've been her round so come on
let's get to
my
like we would have satanic Christmassy
and play piano in the Chateau Bobby
kink it undermines y'all I think about
the girl all the time
to the Westside so I hope you guys
enjoyed this video let me know if you
like this whole like vlogging camera
thing I don't know I might just keep
this for my blogging channel but I like
the quality of this camera a lot it's
the canon g7x for those of you wondering
if you did enjoy this video make sure to
give it a big thumbs up it's pretty
quick but I get so many questions on how
I do my makeup literally 5 minutes it
takes me to do my makeup and not even
kidding you like this you know live out
the door it's awesome even good for like
back-to-school if you want to wear like
a no makeup makeup look because it
doesn't look too intense obviously if
you don't want to wear lipstick you
don't have to but I think this is a
pretty good no makeup look yeah let me
know in the comments down below what
other videos you'd like to see next and
I have some more coming for you guys

you guys all so much and I will see you
