getting so many requests why don't you
do that I've been getting so many
requests do a no heat hairstyle and I've
done a few of these on my channel before
and they do really well and you guys
seem to really like them but I'm pretty
boring when it comes to my hair like I
literally keep it natural like this get
out of the shower I let it dry keep it
natural pretty much all the time like I
never put any heat I never do anything
to my hair but I do do some cute huh do
do huh I do some cute hairstyles once in
a while and you guys always seem to like
them on snapchat in him and in my
blogging channels so I figured I would
just show you some things I feel like
I've done these hairstyles before in
different videos but never in one video
combined so yeah that's what I'm just
going to get into so if you are
interested in seeing a few of my
favorites no heat hairstyles that you
could use for summer if you're at the
beach at the pool don't know what to do
with your hair you want to look kind of
cute then stay tuned starting off with
some dry shampoo because my hair is
pretty greasy since this is probably the
third or fourth day after I wash my hair
I'm just using this dry shampoo by Amica
it smells amazing and it doesn't leave
any like white residue so I love it
this first hairstyle is like one of my
favorite hairstyles to do when I'm bored
so basically you're going to start off
with just doing a regular fishtail braid
but you're going to pull the strands
underneath each other instead of over
and there's like a million tutorials
like this on YouTube that you could
search and then afterwards you're going
to split one section of hair into three
and you're going to start braiding for a
bit and then switch back to like
fishtail then you do braids then fish
shells and braid the fishtail you kind
of switch it up as you can see right
here and it makes a really cool braid
once that's done I just secure it with a
clear elastic and then I start to pull
apart the braid you can pull apart as
much as you guys like if you like tight
braids go for it but I like my braids
really thick and chunky and messy
looking so I'm just going to go crazy
and pull it apart and make it look super
bohemian and nice
this next hairstyle is another side
braid so all you're going to do is
section off a front piece as like your
bang and then another bigger section and
then the last two sections you're going
to start fishtailing that all the way
down just like this and then you're
going to pull it apart like crazy and I
mean like really pull it apart to the
point that it's like almost falling out
the trick with this is to start from the
bottom kind of holding the elastic in
place and working your way up and slowly
just like grabbing chunks and pulling it
out as much as you can until it looks
like this once you're done with that
you're going to take that smaller
section that you left out before and
you're going to start doing a regular
braid and once you are done that you're
going to sit no you're not going to
secure it you're going to hold it in
place and you're going to pull it apart
like you did the fishtail braid just
being very careful that you don't like
take out the pieces on the bottom then
you're going to kind of attach the
smaller braid on to the larger braid so
I stick the small braid through the
large one and just attach it to the same
exact elastic so I kind of just re tie
the bottom so that it secures it in
place and that way I don't have to use
two last six instead of one and then I
bobby pin the top
this next hairstyle is probably the
easiest thing to do ever so all you're
going to do is gather up all your hair
on top of your head as if you're going
to make a ponytail but you're just going
to make a messy bun so you're going to
go half way through pull the hair and
then kind of just secure at all in this
messy type of bun
you can bobby pin pieces in like the
back and stuff if you feel like they're
going to fall out but I just kind of
tuck it into the elastic and then I pull
some hairs out around my face to make it
look more messy and that's how I like it
this is a twist on the messy bun so what
you're going to do is just tie your hair
into a high ponytail on top of your head
making it quite tight because you don't
want to have any messy ponytails so that
it falls out throughout the day you're
going to begin by fishtailing
your ponytail so exactly the same thing
like I just showed you before taking
small sections from each side and
bringing it over to the other side
making a very tight fishtail and then
securing the ends with a clear elastic
and then surprise surprise you're going
to pull out the fishtail to make it very
thick then you are going to wrap the
fishtail around itself to create some
kind of fishtail bun and then you're
just going to play around with it until
you like it so you can pull out pieces
around your face pull out the fishtail
on the bun make it any kind of thickness
that you like and voila super cute
little fishtail bun these last two
hairstyles are very similar and I think
they're my go-to hairstyles I do them
all the time you see me do them in like
every single video they're all over
Instagram basically it's the half up top
knot and like you just saw you just
twist it up into a bond with a clear
elastic position on top of your head and
it's super simple and easy it's like a
great way to have your hair out of your
face but still have your hair down if
that makes any sense
I really like it
and for the last hairstyle this is
basically the same thing except for it's
not a bun it's just a ponytail so a half
up half down ponytail I actually used to
do this as a child and it's like my
favorite hairstyle yeah so I'm wearing
it again so that is going to be it for
this video if you liked any of these
looks make sure to give this video a big
thumbs up let's try and get it to 10,000
thumbs up that would be amazing and I
don't know these are very simple quick
easy hairstyles I'm sure there's like a
billion videos like this out on YouTube
somewhere but these are things I like to
do and obviously check out my Instagram
if you want to see more detailed
pictures of my hair and stuff because I
love to like fool around with hair and
posting on Instagram and yes I love you
guys all so much and I will see you all
in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
