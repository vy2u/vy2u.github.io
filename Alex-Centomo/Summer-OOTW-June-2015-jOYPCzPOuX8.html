right now if you can't tell and it's
probably pretty echoey that is because
my room is literally a million degrees
and I need to have a fan going because
for some reason the air conditioning
just does not circulate into my room and
I was dying of heat so I'm filming in my
dining room I decide to film an outfit
of the week video for you guys because I
get so many questions about my fashion
and my you know what I like to wear and
stuff and if you guys didn't know I have
a fashion account on Instagram where I
post like all my outfits and everything
but I do get a lot of requests to do up
for the week videos and I love filming
videos like this I think it's so fun so
these are actual outputs I did wear
during the week but I filmed it all in
one day just because it's easier that
way for me but they are the outfits that
I wore since it's summertime
the weather is beautiful and I just love
being creative with my outfits I
actually want to talk about something
really quickly before we get into the
video there is this fashion app that
I've discovered maybe around a week in a
bit ago but I've been using so much so
it's called pin and Tucker what's really
cool about is that you can actually show
up on the app what I love about the app
so much is that like for me percent's is
what I use it for I post my outfits and
then I ask suggestions and like what
people think about it because you know
when you're like going shopping and you
want to buy something and you don't know
if you like one shirt or like you know
one more than the other and I'm always
texting my friends like which one and
they're always texting me but this app
is basically like that like you could
post it on to your account being like
yay or nay or like which one do you like
better and then like your followers or
people your friends or whatever can you
know tell you like like it or tell you
which one they like better and stuff and
it's just a really fun way to I guess be
interactive so if you guys are
interested you can follow me on the app
I think it would be so much fun if I
went shopping like next week or
something and then like every time I'm
trying something on I can post it and
then you guys can let me know which
things you like better and then whatever
on you guys choose for each outfit maybe
I'll do a giveaway or something and I'll
give those clothes away to you or maybe
I don't know what do you guys think like
I think it would be really fun so just
I'll leave a link down below where you
can download the app and you can follow
me obviously my
my username is just Alex and Toma like
it is on almost every single social
media platform and let me know what you
guys think of the app down in the
comments and if you guys make an account
let me know and I'll go follow you and
we can like help each other shop and
stuff I think it's so much fun because
it's another way for us to be like
interactive with each other just helping
each other shop a shopaholics know what
it's like okay so yes without further
ado let's get into the video
I love you and I know she'll be the
death of me at least we'll both enough
it should always get the best of me the
worst is
I'm just
where do we belong where did we go wrong
if there's nothing here why are we still
here where do we belong where did we go
wrong if there's nothing here why are we
still here why do we belong here I love
you
we never
want you done still still falling away
from me when it takes so long fires out
what do you want to be never gonna be so
sure like a skip instead
letting
sir
- five gone
skip bells I'm not telling you again
what you need is just a slap around to
make everything stop kill the ball when
you come back down but thing you want
just tease maybe a matter touch you tell
me what you
come to the staff at the things that are
a blow so hope you guys enjoyed this
