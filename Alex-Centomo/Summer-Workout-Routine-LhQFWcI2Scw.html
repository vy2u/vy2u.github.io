baptize by rocket room
go in the gutter
never great
on the Boulevard of broken dreams
John Cougar John Deere John 3:6
what's up guys so I'm so excited because
I'm finally sitting down to film my much
requested workout routine video for you
guys I work out differently in the
winter compared to this summer just
because the weather's so much nicer
where I live so I can workout outside
and I do completely different things as
you guys know I've been doing something
quite different
trying to work really hard in my body
eating healthy all that stuff so without
further ado let's just get into the
video because you know I don't mind
choose to be any more longer because
they take so long sometimes let's go I'm
going to start off with my workout
must-haves so the first thing I have to
say is a workout bra and shorts of any
type I just have simple black ones and
of course my favorite running shoes
which are by Nike they're just simple
classic old running shoes another one of
my summer Fitness must-haves is the new
Playtex sport liners I know this might
be a little TMI for some of you but I am
a girl and I got a lot of questions on
what I use when I work out during at
that time of month I've been using
Playtex for years but I swear by this
new pack because it's perfect for when
you're active it offers to sport level
protection in one convenient package to
keep you comfortable and dry no matter
what the activity I honestly swear I'd
quickly want to thank Playtex sport for
sending me this package to show I could
show you guys in the video but I promise
you I do not sponsor or show you
anything that I don't truly believe in
and use myself starting off with my
workout routine of course for summer I
love to run running is my favorite thing
to do in the entire world I just run
outside for like usually 40 minutes to
an hour
light jog to moderate it just relieves a
lot of stress and anxiety I then stretch
my neck my arms and just kind of like
warm up my body before I do any core
exercises I find it really helps with my
muscles and my circulation
on to the foot exercises I do around
three times 20 squats every single day
actually I take a break usually once a
week but I love doing squats they really
work my legs and my butt make it nice
and firm and then I also do some lunges
because that works as well of course the
legs working more on the butt I do
around three times fifteen of these like
leg raises things I alternate between
straight leg and bent me that makes any
sense
and then I switch legs every time and I
also do this thing out to the side but I
don't know if I do it properly so please
let me know in the comments because I
have no idea what I'm doing I just know
that it burns and feels good afterwards
oh hey there's me lifting up my leg so
awkward isn't really weird so I do this
to work on my thighs I find it works
really well for the inner and outer
thigh I do like big circles and up and
down and this one works the inner thigh
and I really like it I do around two
times 50 I'd say to be honest I kind of
just go till it really burns and then I
stop and take a break and do the other
leg if you couldn't tell already I'm
kind of obsessed work in my legs my butt
and my stomach so here's another little
exercise I love to do I really try and
squeeze my butt as hard as I can as soon
as I'm lifting up and then here are just
some normal crunches or sit-ups whatever
you want to call I really suck at these
like really bad Daniels making fun of me
the whole time but honestly I try my
best guys please don't judge me another
one of my favorite workouts is this one
it really works the lower abs so I just
like alternate between doing crosses my
legs and little kicks and I keep my
hands under my bum to keep my back flat
on the ground and then these leg races
are really good for the lower abs as
well I do again this I just do it until
it burns basically
this is random but I actually like to
walk on my hands and it really helps
with my arms and stuff I like it and
then this workout helps with my butt
again I usually do two times 50 of this
as for these jumps I can do around ten
in a row before I feel like I'm gonna
die so yes just ten better than nothing
right
usually on a leg day I don't like to do
arms but this is one of my favorite arm
exercises I figured I'd show you guys
anyways and all you need is bleachers or
a chair and it's perfect for your
triceps then I stretch it all out to
make sure that I'm not extremely sore
the next day and this works wonders
so I hope you guys enjoyed that video
let me know in the comments down below

about the things I'm doing or if you
have any suggestions for any other
videos hopefully this helps you in some
way just a little disclaimer I'm not a
professional so I'm not a personal
trainer or anything like that this is
just what I do to keep healthy for me
