channel I am chilling on my floor again
and I just got a shower so my hair is
looking a little wonky right now if you
guys are new to my channel make sure you
click the subscribe button and also the
notification the little Bell things so
that you know when my videos are going
up give this video a thumbs up if you
like puppies that bite you when you're
trying to film make sure you subscribe
to me and Dan's vlogging channel because
we are doing vlogmas this year and I'm
so excited it is booth first Christmas I
just think it's gonna be so much fun we
have a lot of fun things planned I said
fun toys on the same sentence but it's
fine I have had an idea to do this type
of video for a while now and there are
definitely many reasons for it but if
you can't tell by the title I am
surprising my sister with a really big
birthday present it's not just about
that though my sister has been going
through a really kind of tough bit of
her life I'd say the past year has been
pretty rough for her it's not really my
business to say so I'm not gonna talk
about anything personal but I wanted to
do something that I think could really
just make her happy and surprise her and
not that I think you need anything
materialistic to make yourself happy I
don't believe that at all but I am in a
position where I can do something for
her like this and I know that it will
make her happy in the moment and there's
nothing I can really do to make her
happy long term that's something that
she needs to work on herself as long as
she knows that I'm there for her which
she does and yeah I just I just really
wanted to do this for her so without
further ado let's just get into the
video okay guys I am currently just
sitting in my car right now I am parked
on the side of the road because I'm off
to get part of my sister's birthday
present so my idea was to get her a bag
that she has been not this specific bag
she's wanted a bigger designer bag for a
very long time I cannot wait to see the
look on her face so that's like the big
present and then I'm also gonna be
getting her a fragrance that she really
really loves a few little knickknacks
here and there so I'm going downtown
today to get all the knickknacks as well
as the perfume the bag I bought online
and that should be shipped in this week
and
I'm just really excited so cat Bell is
actually gonna be helping me today I am
really thankful for her I just want to
get Kyla like personalized gifts for her
that I know goes towards her personality
so good no she has a K on it I love it
morning she needs her coffee show it it
like matches the cup too
yeah and I think this was naturally
belong to the room and I think I might
put either a picture of like us from
Europe or from like a trip of us
together yeah that was like a really fun
time just like memories or maybe also
picture of me it's like a prank after
that you could just tell her to change
