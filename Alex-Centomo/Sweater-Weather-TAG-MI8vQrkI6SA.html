start this video because I don't know if
you guys can tell from your screen which
I'm sure you can but I got a new camera
which is super exciting because I have
wanted this camera for a very long time
like I think the past four years I
wanted a really good DSLR to take
pictures and really good videos and I
finally invested in one so I'm just
super excited to start making videos for
you guys because this camera is honestly
amazing I love it
it is the Canon t5i and if you have any
questions or whatever you can just leave
them in the comments below I'll also put
some information about the camera and
such like that down in the description
so as you can tell by the title below
this is the sweater weather tag I have
been seeing this tag go around YouTube
for a while now I don't remember who
created it but when I figure that out I
will leave her channel link down below
in the description and I just always
really liked the tag I wasn't personally
tagged but I am definitely going to tag
some people down below and I hope to see
them and do this tag as well because
it's a really fun tag and honestly just
the title of it
I mean sweater weather the neighborhood
that song is amazing I love it
and yeah so let's just get started so my
favorite candle scent for this season
has definitely been sweater weather and
not just because it's the name of this
tag I just love this scent so much it's
honestly just a really nice fresh scent
and it reminds me of clean like clean
clothes but not in a gross way that it
smells like laundry detergent or
anything like that it's just really
fresh and clean and crisp and I just
really like the name of the sweater I
had gone into bath and Bodyworks with my
boyfriend's younger sister and I was
smelling leaves of course because I love
leaves and we both felt this and fell in
love that we were just like oh my god
this smells so good so I knew I had to
go back and purchase it later on because
I've just been obsessed with the scent
and leaves his burning right now but
this is definitely my favorite candle I
think by far of all time I'm like trying
not to burn it because it smells so good
so this is actually a really hard
question for me to answer because I love
tea I've always been a tea girl but I
can't say no to hot chocolate I love hot
chocolate as well so I think I would
drink tea more before I would go to bed
kind of like a relaxing tea just you
know to get me ready to go to bed and
hot chocolate is more it's more of a
holiday treat for me I like to drink it
you know before Christmas when you're
cuddled up cozy on the couch by the fire
reading a book or watching a Christmas
movie and just like a really cozy
sweater and a nice cup of hot chocolate
I just think is awesome so yeah I think
definitely be tea or hot chocolate and
honestly Tim Hortons hot chocolate is by
far my favorite chocolate I don't know
what they do to it it's just so good oh
and for tea definitely David's tea I
love all the holiday scents I collect
them every single winter and they're
just my favorite I think my favorite
fall memories definitely when I was
younger my dad used to rake all the
leaves in a huge pile in my backyard and
then my sister and I would just go crazy
and jump at them before we put them all
in bags and just would make a crazy mess
and it was just so fun and I just you
know looking back with those pictures or
watching old videos and seeing that just
brings a big smile to my face and every
time it's fall it just reminds me of
that and I just really like this time of
year because it just brings me back to
being a kid again and like carefree
worryfree
and my dad was just awesome and then
after we playing the leaves my mom would
have made us some hot chocolate or
gotten a movie ready and then we would
also down together as a family and it
was just one of the best times
I think that's it jumping in a big pile
of leaves
I really suck at doing winged liner my
eyes are pretty crap so it's really hard
for me I don't have contacts so ignoring
my glasses and I don't really know what
I'm doing
I definitely love dark lips it's
something that I've been experiencing
experimenting with this year especially
I used to never wear dark lips used to
always be a pink or a nude kind of girl
and as you could tell by this video my
lips are just super bright and bold and
I've just been loving it though because
it's so different and just makes your
teeth look really white
the first thing I do once I get out of
the shower normally is I apply this
cream and it is the daily smooth body
butter by soap &amp;amp; Glory it smells amazing
I know I have raved about this multiple
times and videos before but it's
honestly it's it's definitely my
favorite scent in the whole entire world
because it just smells so good it
reminds me kind of of the Coco
Mademoiselle Chanel perfume but a bit
sweeter and more subtle and it's just
really pretty and girly and fun and I
just really really like it but it's also
a little warm which is definitely my
kind of scent I don't like things when
they're too sweet or too fruity so bit
more on the musky warmer side it's
definitely down my alley the next thing
I do is I use my Misti or perfume and
this is just the regular one in the big
bottle and this smells yeah this bowl
I'm obsessed with this scent it smells
so girly and just it's a really classic
scent so if you're looking for something
that's not too over-the-top strong then
I would definitely go for misty or
perfume I get so many compliments on it
every time I wear these two things
together they are just my favorite
things pepper and this is not
necessarily a fall scent for me because
I did wear this kind of near the end of
summer but it does go well with every
single season so that's just what I've
been using so my favorite Thanksgiving
food I think would have to be mashed
potatoes and that's normally what I have
in my family I'm not so sure about your
family but my family normally has like
turkey stuffing we have some kind of
vegetable things salad then the
cranberry and gravy and the mashed
potatoes and quite far for me is mashed
potatoes just because I love french
fries and I love potatoes and that's
just what I like turkey is good don't
get me wrong I like turkey but I mean I
normally only eat it when it's
Thanksgiving or Christmas or something
like that I never have it any other time
it's definitely good but I wouldn't be
able to have it without the mashed
potatoes cuz it's just so good
I live in Canada and the weather here
right now it's pretty cold it's like
almost winter here I find it really
strange I don't know if it just goes on
in my head or what but I find like
winter lasts so long and then it's
spring for a little bit and then jumps
back to winter spring for a little bit
then it's summer which is like okay and
then fall laughs like a month and then
it's back to winter I don't know why but
it seems like so fast it just goes from
like hot to cold in two seconds and I
wish fall lasted a bit longer obviously
I don't complain I love snow during the
holidays but if it could just tone down
a little bit and you know start
springing earlier then that would be
great but right now it's kind of like
getting ready to snow which is pretty
crappy
okay so my most worn sweater see this is
a hard question for me because I own so
many sweaters and I wear them all the
time just big baggy chunky sweaters just
like this one and I own so many I love
them all but I would have to say that my
most worn one would have to be this one
right here hold on if I can get it up
this one from brandy melville it's just
the the Bettina
sweater it's like a normal goodie with a
hood like this but I really like this
because the texture is really comfy
they're so soft and I like them because
they're really long and they cover your
butt so you can wear them with leggings
and like uggs or combat boots or
whatever you want and I wear this all
the time like I'm not even kidding I
will wear it to go out shopping or
wherever I'm going
I'll wear to school I'll wear it just at
home to lounge around it's so
comfortable and it's weird because I
don't think brandy is selling Bettina
sweaters anymore
I know they saw the Leila honey's now
which are like almost identical except
for the fact that they have a little
slit on the side and they're a little
bit shorter but I do love the patinas
because they were so long so brandy if
you're watching this please bring the
patinas back because I love them so much
and it would be awesome to purchase this
exact sweater in different colors and
have it cover my butt because I'm kind
of a tall person so the other ones
aren't so flattering on me but this I
definitely love and definitely recommend
so my most worn nail polish for the fall
but definitely I can't pick one so I'm
gonna have to show you three because
these colors are just like my go-to
colors I kind of just have them on
rotation and I just really like them so
the first one is this color called
Bahama Mama and it's just a really nice
deep plum color and it's super pretty
for the fall time especially with I find
simple clothing I'm a pretty simple girl
so when it comes to clothing I like to
keep it not too many I don't own too
many graphics I'm very plain tees and
playing jeans and jackets and scarves
and stuff like that so this just looks
perfect against those plain colors and
also I find it looks really nice on any
skin tone which is pretty awesome the
second color I love is called soulmate
and this one is more of a deep burgundy
rather than a deep plum color so it's
more like the maroon side I would say
burgundy like brownish red and it's just
a really really really nice color I
don't know what to say about this
because I have been wearing this for
like two years straight every single
fall and I just love it so much it's
super pretty so these two colors are
pretty similar but if you can see the
difference here once more I'm like the
reddish plumage side the other one's
more on like a brown side they're both
really pretty though the third color is
this very nice topi gray color and this
one's called merino cool it's really
nice
I wear this most of the time in the fall
the other colors I will kind of switch
up and wear them during the winter too
but this one is kind of more strictly
fall it's super nice so flattering on
every skin tone I'm not just saying that
like I have pale friends that wear this
color and it's super nice and I have
girls I have friends that have dark skin
and it looks amazing on it and I find
this looks really cool if you put kind
of like a matte top coat on on top of it
because it's a it's a pretty shiny nail
polish but with a new matte coat it's
really cool and I would say all these
three nail polishes are pretty opaque so
you don't need that many coats I usually
just put two coats just
to make sure because I don't like it
when they're streaky but I mean you can
probably get away with one coat but make
sure you use base coat and top coat
because or else you might ruin your
nails
I would definitely say jumping in the
leaves kind of gal because I don't
really watch sports to be honest I was a
very athletic girl growing up but I
sucked at any team sports so like
football soccer baseball anything like
that horrible at I was a swimmer and a
dancer and me watching sports just
doesn't happen so definitely jumping the
leaves I still jump in the leaves to
this day so yeah it's a little weird but
whatever it's fun I am all about comfort
so I definitely go for the leggings I
rarely wear jeans anymore it's either
jeggings or leggings so definitely
leggings and every girl needs a pair of
nice black leggings I love uggs because
they're just really comfortable and I
love comfort for fashion I would
definitely go for the combat boots and I
do own both different kinds in both I
own a few different uggs in a few
different combat boots so it's kind of
hard for me to decide if you're gonna be
more on the comfortable side I'd
definitely say uggs and if you're gonna
be more in the trendy fashion side I
would definitely go for the combat boots
because I don't know I wouldn't wear
like a skirt with uggs it wouldn't be
that nice but I do wear Uggs more than I
wear combat boots cuz they're just so
comfortable and I'm obsessed with
Australia so
yes I definitely think pumpkin spice is
worth the hype I know so many people
that hate it but I personally love
pumpkin spice lattes from Starbucks I'm
just one of those typical girls that
loves the pumpkin spice latte and I'm
not ashamed to admit it because it's
really really really good I honestly
haven't been watching that much TV this
fall I just haven't had the time people
always ask me what my favorite TV shows
are and obviously I say pretty little
liars because I'm just a huge Pretty
Little Liars fan although I did watch
all the seasons of Breaking Bad in like
a week and that was kind of the fall so
I can say maybe that was my fault show
but other than that I just kind of
watched YouTube so
I have really been enjoying Lord lately
I have been listening to her songs on
repeat and I think my two favorite songs
are definitely team and and ribs I just
think those two songs are awesome and
they definitely get me in the fall mood
I listen to them while I'm getting ready
in the morning and just really her voice
is just amazing so if you're interested
in watching those videos or listening to
that music I will link them down below
so you can check it out because she's
honestly incredible and I think team is
my favorite song yeah okay guys so I
hope you enjoyed this video I will leave
some channels down below that I tagged
to do this tie as well so hopefully they
will see it and recreate this tie I
thought it was a lot of fun and just
getting really excited for well I'm
already really excited for fall and it
is fall right now and I just love the
season but it's making me super excited
for the holidays then I'm just in a
really good mood right now
