again um it's not a makeup tutorial this
time she doesn't have a youtube channel
but she does have an instagrams to go
follow her Trisha Jensen it's not too
wise choice I'll just leave it down
below can go follow her and stalk her
and she also has a tumblr if you want to
follow that to a post down below whoa um
I know but I'm go to guys i just made it
so go follow it um so today we're going
to be doing the best tag ever it
actually is the best time ever it was
created by miranda sings here on youtube
and then I actually watched the version
with turning do your daily grace and
help yeah we decided to do it because it
was really funny so indeed she wrote the
questions down on her new iphone so
first question okay what is your
favorite toe um I think my favorite toe
is probably my big toe because it's
easier to paint nail polish on any other
clothes are size small I think I would
have to say my small toe because it's so
cute like it's a little stubby thing if
you think about it toads are so ugly I
hate feet like yeah a lot of people
don't like me but it like really like
they're just like little stubs so like
footing there's barely any or outie is
it asking what I have or what I prefer
is it even asked me about belly buttons
or just in general like are you in the
closet or out of the closet Oh are you
in any art OD because it fits like in
life and I guess I'm out with my
straightness but except if it comes to
like Jennifer Lawrence I'm kind of like
oh I changed cuz she's I just love her
die I think sometimes Miley Cyrus
actually I'm kind of attracted her I
think she's sexy yeah I'm not like her
but Lutton but anyways haven't any Oh
belly button yeah any and I kind of like
a nice better than ever
think I like I don't like because mines
are really in and it looks no like it's
really bad like I look like I have a
ginormous belly button lights no I'm see
you know in know any normal in pictures
like I want to show you guys like it oh
no you have to likes to look at pictures
as like people that I work with in the
summer they'll tell you like the
pictures were my belly one looks cute
okay third question third favorite
flavor okay I'm gonna go through them my
first one is chocolate milk by far Oh in
the lead also good and its really good
second okay wait flavors I mean like a
food a flavor is it a flavor of food I
know but like mint is a flavor it's not
a food like it's a food but it's not
like yeah it's not like pizza oh I don't
know because if it's just like flavor
like sweet salty sour whenever that I
probably would say sours my third
because I like salty than Johnny and
it's ours probably my third yeah cool
favorite tree I want to sing Christmas
trees it's almost Christmas but that's
cliche but I like the smell of Christmas
trip that's true i'll just try get in
your house mmm it just makes it just
makes me excited for the holidays it
makes me happy but i do like palm trees
to reminds me it's like oh yeah like
Ellen yeah are like just tropical
environment and I like that so I like
maple trees cuz I'm Katie Ann oh my god
i don't really like that yeah so yeah
palm tree and christmas tree which I rod
you prefer which ones that you're right
why because it flows nicer it flows like
it's a very nice like art and there's no
like misplaced whatever this one has a
go where's the squiggle up here like I
would have to go with neither because
they don't have very nice eyebrows they
actually don't really exist i have to
really fill them in and every single day
my sister is like what are you doing no
there well they don't look that bad they
look real um i really don't have a lot
of eyebrows oh no really i have seven
the way said i did not make sense
I have someone I don't have many
eyebrows no like really I have hair yeah
I don't have much hair there it's just
kind of like toilet paper or hand hand
and then I'd eat my hahahaha um I
think it depends on like what context if
you're going to the bathroom and toilet
paper toilet toilet um but you need your
hand to grab the toilet paper that's
true so like what do you do what was
your first impression of yourself I was
very weird hmm very serious and I was
pretty cool actually I've never the
person does that mean like the first
time I looked at myself and actually had
a thought like about myself is that that
means I guess because I remember oh
we're going to summarize hey I think I
was like 7 or 8 i'm like you know when
you go really really close to your
mirror to like see all your
imperfections no okay well i did that
and i was looking at myself and I was
like well I'm it was pretty sure I was
nobody so I was like a little fat blob
um if I probably would have done that
when I was younger than I probably would
have thought the same thing good again
insert picture i don't know i think the
first time I actually like you know like
those like back in the day like quizzes
here to do by yourself and it was like
all the questions you had to answer and
we were to post on facebook i know if
you ever did those oh I did so like
gonna be like what do you think about
yourself forever and it was always like
awkward stream yeah word up word that's
a good way to put it very awkward
extremely okay question number eight how
many having amongst will give its good
answer how many how many what how many
dogs do you have to come in cats do I
have tres how many nipples too I have I
would probably say like six just cuz 66
the devil ya know I don't know six cuz
like that's my favorite number so yeah
really was six cuz i was born on july
six wow that's losers yeah kid death or
not okay I'm gonna be honest you're
gonna choose death no I shot well
depends on what though like no dad no
I'm someone you hate then yeah whoa I
was gonna say no I don't want to die
that's how does it say but if you think
about it death is like the most
fascinating thing no really I've been
scared of death I don't think it was
yeah it's scary but like it's like like
what does it feel like like you'll never
know and then once would you know yeah
but once you do you won't be able to
like talk about with someone you I don't
think I'll even be able to understand
because you'll be dead so you won't
actually feel the feeling cuz like you
won't be able to process it you saying
that's so but in general I would say not
because life is awesome mm-hmm okay
number 10 which person have you not met
my husband why don't watch which is true
well I might have maybe you did you
don't know probably not maybe what if
it's like someone you don't believe in
marriage so what why what do you mean
what do you don't know like I don't know
I just like you don't know wedding well
I guess but like I should float my boat
right now I haven't met Jennifer
Lawrence I'm here so unfortunately gonna
go with that that's a weird question
that's hard to think of there's a lot of
people i haven't met yeah there are a
lot of people i have met so 11 solid yes
yeah actually I mean I love salads we're
talking about this give it it mm-hmm we
both love very creative fruity just
different salads but i have to say pizza
fries chips can't beat it I can't like
salad is good is you want to be healthy
right but like if I were to have a
choice into what I could eat and not
gain weight then I would just go 40
knots
because definitely can you name all six
presidents Brahma Oh the wrong exorcism
Obama like I see there's a prize I guess
there's only six countries that have
presidents then maybe there's just a
stupid question which color do you
prefer black or white black mmm I like
black clothing but I like white snow
yeah that yeah but I was thinking
clothes a lot close if it's not bad oh
whoops if it's not black put it back
once you go black I've never gone block
to be honest neither your vibe hmm how
many haters none cuz I'm awesome mmm one
year no people like me now well you're
cool so no thanks on a scale from one to
ten where are you 10 I'm really thinking
about this week on a scale of one to ten
about a hundred i would say no I want to
see my Leonov like a scale of one to ten
up like the hotness level or the scale
of one to ten I love about 12 what about
if it's like ugly but if it's like okay
how funny are you on a scale of one to
ten Mike a seven I myself well in my
head I'm like 10 cuz i think im so funny
but like in reality i'm really not that
funny so probably like a to know i would
give you at least like a six you have to
be like one under week's end okay but in
general just in like life i would say
like 7.5 7.6 for me no like eight I
think it's a good number because it's an
even number and I like even numbers
better than odd numbers I don't know why
well do the weird arm things cuz that's
what people do in videos once they're
done look we are done the video
oh um I hope you liked it this tag was
pretty weird um we thought it was funny
oh I love this phone another husband
give this video a thumbs up if you
enjoyed it and also leave in the
comments below what your scale one to
ten would be if in general life because
I'm interested in knowing actually what
people think of themselves because I
feel like a lot of people in their head
think they're really high but then they
don't want to say it out loud because I
was gonna say that before yeah like I
want to say like eight but I don't want
to sound arrogant yeah that's exactly it
like in your head you feel and then if
you do say a high number you're kind of
like you say it sarcastically as if like
it's like you know I'm a 10 I can we all
just be straight up about it yeah if you
have any suggestions on videos or tags
then leave it down below because yeah
that's what I know a lot of you guys
want me to do a hair tutorial I get that
question like every single day so yes
