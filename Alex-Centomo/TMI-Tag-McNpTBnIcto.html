sister Kyla and I have been requested so
many times do this tag it's the TMI tag
and I was also tagged by Karina and
Katherine if you don't know who they are
I will link their channels down below
but I'm sure you guys know who they are
and I figured I would do it with my
sister today because we live together
and we get a lot of similar questions so
I figured it would just be fun and yeah
let's just get right into it so the
first question is what are you wearing
I'll go first yeah okay so I am wearing
a kind of salt-and-pepper ish top from
Free People
it's kind of low-cut in the front and
then open in the back I can't really
turn that far um and I just have my hair
blow-dry didn't even straighten it or
anything that's why it's so frizzy um
I'm wearing a necklace that my boyfriend
bought me it's Versace and my lipstick
is lip liner I don't know where it's
from and I'm wearing this top from
brandy melville it's like a oversized
t-shirt slash dress kind of thing I
don't know it's really cool and then I'm
wearing this necklace from nomadic store
I will link their website down below cuz
they have really cool chokers and stuff
and I just really like it and I don't
have any nail polish on but my lipstick
is actually a lip liner it's make up
forever 15 C is the color next question
ever been in love oh yeah I'm in love
right now I have a boyfriend
me too I'm in love with my boyfriend my
boyfriend ever had a terrible breakup um
I've never had a terrible breakup no oh
yeah I'm just I'm I'm gonna say she's
had a bad breakup my wife is actually in
my first real boyfriend and like serious
boyfriend so why don't ever actually had
to break up before so now how tall are
you
I'm five eight I'm five six by five how
much do you weigh that's an awkward
question who put that in there any
tattoos I have three tattoos I don't
have any tattoos
any piercings yes I have ten piercings I
have one on each year and I used to have
my bellybutton pierced but I took it out
because it started swelling up after
life
of having it really yeah it was like it
really heard of animo I was cleaning it
but like I only had I think three and I
wouldn't clean it like every single time
so it was like better my favorite show

not even ashamed to admit it
um my favorite shows Criminal Minds
hello that's good show yeah I paid a
little liars favorite bands

neighborhood the weekend all that stuff
but I really like the oldies like the
Beatles yes the Beatles
favorite song move that's hard I don't
have a favorite song but I've been
listening to ariana grande's break free
oh yeah that's pretty catchy I listen to
when I work out zodiac sign I'm a
Sagittarius I'm a cancer follow you look
for in a partner for me would be kind it
kindness and also someone who's driven
and has goals yeah ambition yeah and
they have to honestly though the main
thing is though they just have to look
make me happy yeah well favorite quote
for me to be the wolf that wins is the
wolf you feed um I don't really have a
favorite quote but the other day my
sister was actually giving me advice and
she quoted that and ever since then I
love that quote if you guys know where
that's from leave it down in the
comments cuz I'm not telling you
favorite actor would probably Paul Rudd

really funny I like um oh what's this
guy's name he was at the he was the
afternoon Ted Mark Wahlberg Mark
Wahlberg I love him
loud music or soft I like listening to
loud music when I'm like working out or
getting ready and then soft music more
when I'm like chilling uh-huh yeah same
thing where do you go when you're sad
probably for like a walk I go when I'm
sad I either go to my best friend Sam's
house and we just talk about it or in
the summer I go to this park that I have
down the street and I just go and look
at the Ducks swim and said by the
waterless team to the water move
I just like being in nature yeah like
soothing and calming it really makes me
feel better and also kind just gets your
mind off of yeah how long does it take
you to shower probably like 10 minutes
like Juanes yeah I would say that I'm
sure of mine is watching this it's
probably been no take you sue if you
think about 10 minutes is long showers
so how long does it take you to get
ready in the morning um if I'm like
getting ready to go somewhere where I
need to like do my hair and makeup then
probably like an hour and if I'm just
literally rolling out of bed and washing
my face and like 10 minutes
yeah same I mean I don't wear makeup
when I go places like evers like when I
when I'm getting ready in the morning to
go to school I literally just roll out
of bed either take a shower and go to
school I don't put any makeup on and I
just wear sweat pads in a sweatshirt or
if I'm actually going somewhere then
yeah probably like an hour ever been in
a physical fight
oh boy once and that was very myriad why
did it why did we get into a fight you
went in my room and you took one of my
shirts and I was like you can't wear
that shirt I just gone it knows it my
favorite shirt and you were like no I'm
not taking it off and like you were
really being like we weren't taking my
shirt off and I was like Alex you can't
wear it and then you were wearing heels
too because you're going somewhere and I
was like take off my shirt and I pushed
you and you went flying onto my bed with
in your heels
and then you push me back and then I ran
under the room crying I'm pretty sure
there was more to it than that I'm
pretty sure there's a bit more fighting
but yeah we got jumper
we got into a physical fight once and
yeah never again
that was awkward really don't really
fight like that no we just we going to
look at 2-minute argument yeah
turn on um like I said before someone
who's driven and someone who's kind yeah
someone who's driven someone who's kind
and honestly my biggest turn-on though
is someone who's not selfish someone
who's selfish oh I don't know I don't
like that when they just think about
themselves yeah someone who's selfless
is good yeah turn off um someone who
smokes oh yeah someone who smokes
who just goes to parties all the time
and doesn't have any ambition to do and
bomb with basically the opposite of what
we just said that before fears I have a
fear of spiders definitely I'm scared of
spiders and I also have a fear of the
ocean like not the beach but the ocean
