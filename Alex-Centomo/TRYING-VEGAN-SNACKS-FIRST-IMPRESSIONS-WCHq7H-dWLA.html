channel I've been here and he's up Oh No
yeah can you please sit this is gonna be
so hard to film very needy okay baby
good night down over there go ahead yeah
good
he's literally shoving his gut into my
knee
okay well welcome back to my channel I'm
here that I'm here with my sister today
my guy and my dog I might have to put
him in the other room if he's not gonna
relax but I'm really excited to film
this video because he's been so calm all
morning this as soon as I turn the
camera on I'm really excited for this
video because I've been getting so many
comments from you guys wanting me to do
this type of video I see them going
around YouTube a lot Tyler's been
wanting to do this with me as well so I
was like why not just do it together
this is gonna be a little bit different
than other videos this one is in
collaboration with private markets so I
just want to say a huge thank you for
them for partnering with me on this
video I'm excited because first of all
we have a bunch of vegan snacks and
there's a lot of things that when I went
on the website and pick things out I was
like oh you got to choose everything
yeah I'm a huge yeah where's it just
bigger than I think it's a big box so it
can like keep everyone entertained but I
was like there's certain things that I
don't know what they're gonna taste like
because this thing is so specifically
not vegan but then they made a vegan
alternative like what you'll see in a
second I'm so excited but this is the
size of the box they're also made from
recycled recycled paper so it's 100%
zero waste and I just really like that
inside the box there's this thriving
market this box is full of good stuff
with this order you've saved money on
amazing organic non-gmo foods and items
from brands you can trust enjoyed fast
delivery which is true this came like
this because it's literally all snacks
it's nothing that we have to cook no no
no they're all snacks and then this
a list of this things that I ordered you
got a bunch of chips so what I like
about track market is the fact that it's
online and super easy to order from it
is an American company I just want to
stress that right now but most of you
guys are American are from the US so I
figured I would let you guys know
because I think more than 50% of you are
from the US I need to own the glasses
somewhere and I don't want him to bite
them he's in a mood right I know he's in
a mood you get like the most affordable
prices for all your non-gmo products oh
my god so it just really makes healthy
living easy and affordable you get all
your non-gmo healthy organic products
for between 25 to 50 percent off of what
you'd get in like supermarkets there's
gonna see a little piece of fur at the
bottom when they can orange toy oh
please
whether you're paleo gluten-free raw
vegan you can find everything you need
on thrive market as well as all the best
ingredients and everything is laid out
on the website which is great too so if
you want to buy something you'll have
you'll see all the ingredients listed
there and you can find stuff from like
food snacks supplements personal care
products like everything you need in one
and on every page you can see things
like why you love it price comparisons
okay I'm gonna put away are we ready
yeah I think what we should do is like
we should stick her hand in and each
pull out a thing and then we try it okay
so this is called way better sweet
potato whole grain corn tortilla chips
it's gluten-free non-gmo whole-grain
nothing artificial it's vegan there's no
trans fat I think we try at the same
time I'd be so good at hummus oh yeah oh
so then coconut chips and caramel sea
salt flavor made from sliced toasted
coconuts which is 100% organic yeah hice
non-gmo gluten-free vegan dairy-free
good source of fiber no preservatives
berries you know what area and I made me
start doing in London and all obsessed
with it you're gonna like it
what buy frozen raspberries and just
snack on them mmm-hmm freeze dried
raspberries mmm oh my gosh in an acai
bowl mmm it's not worth
oh you're really good pink salt organic
popcorn extra virgin organic coconut oil
oh I don't like it I mean it tastes like
just normal pop one okay so these are
the Earth Balance vegan cheddar flavor
squares Cheers Wow how do I do that
what's this maple bacon jerky vegan
jerky that's what I was saying I was
like I don't know how they're gonna make
that also I don't like jerky so I don't
even know if I'll like this what the
heck it looks like dog food
there's no water I still have it in my
mouth it's like the texture hood and I
need something to drink
Shampoo oh I don't even like normal
jerky why would I like the injuries
normal oh my god bacon
habanero tortilla chip tortilla chips
but they're vegan or spicy huh mmm
that's a nice palate cleanser after that
disgusting turd yeah chili lime lentil
chips ooh why they like I would eat it
if it was like in front of me and I had
nothing else to eat it's like you know
when you have those really airy like
what are they called
puffs oh not Cheetos are they Cheetos
no they're not the thin ones are like
the thick cheese puffs and oh yeah
Cheetos yeah Cheetos like it tastes like
that but like not cheese why don't you
double check your last can I open actors
always smell like Teddy Grahams it
tastes healthy if you're gonna eat a
cookie with like a bunch of sugar like
eat a cookie you don't eat like a
healthy looking yeah but I think this is
for people that are like really against
what they put in their body mmm I think
my favorite are these fine were these
