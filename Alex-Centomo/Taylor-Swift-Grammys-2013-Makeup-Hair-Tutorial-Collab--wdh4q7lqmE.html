collaboration that I am doing with three
other girls here on YouTube we found
each other just randomly actually and
we're deciding to do a collaboration
channel soon but to test it out me aside
just to do a video together so we
decided to do a grammys 2013 inspired
look so each one of us chose a different
celebrity to do i am doing taylor swift
and this is the look as you can see i
did the hair and the makeup obviously I
don't have bangs like Taylor does so I
just kind of made a middle part but if
you have bens that is great I know you
also can buy like banging extensions but
I don't really feel like doing that but
yeah so the three other girls here on
YouTube are doing Rihanna JLo Beyonce
and I will like their channels down
below as well as insert some pictures
where you can click at the end of the
video and so yeah if you're interested
in seeing how i did this look then just
keep on watching okay so i started off
with mac eyeshadow and patina and I just
lightly put this all over my lid with a
small eyeshadow brush and I just swept
it into the crease a little bit
I
I then brought the color underneath my
eye to darken up the look using my mac
eyeshadow in would wink I brought this
color onto my lid with the same brush
just the opposite side but I focus it
more towards the outer corner of the eye
and up into the crease
I then blended it out to get rid of any
harsh edges
then using my mac eyeshadow in Naked
Lunch I just brought this into the inner
corner of my eye to brighten up the look
a little bit now taking my mac eyeshadow
in print I'm going to be putting this on
to my upper lash line with a brush sort
of making a winged out effect before I
put on any gel liner
you
I'm bringing underneath the eye to
deepen up the look a little bit more and
then I'm going to be blending out the
print onto my eyelid but focusing more
into the crease
now taking my makeup forever gel
eyeliner I'm going to be applying this
on top of the print with my angled brush
and making a winged cat eye effect same
kind of one that Taylor wore to the
event and I just think this look is
really pretty now taking this Marcel
eyebrow pencil I'm actually going to be
using this as a eyeliner and what I'm
going to be doing is tight lining my
eyes and then kind of filling in any
spaces that I missed with the gel
eyeliner I am them going to be applying
a white eyeliner to my waterline to open
up the I little bit and then taking my
mac eyeshadow in brulee I'm going to be
applying this underneath the brow right
on the brow bone just to highlight it
then going back in with the woodwind
color I'm going to be pulling this
underneath my eye just to darken it up a
little bit
I'm then filling in my eyebrows with my
benefit I broke it in light and I'm
trying to make the same shape that
Taylor has which is a bit more of an
arch that I normally do and then taking
my benefit they're real mascara I'm
going to be applying this to my top
lashes and bottom lashes and giving it a
really nice thick and full look the same
that Taylor does she normally wears
false eyelashes but I didn't feel like
doing that because I'm just doing this
for a video but if you wanted to wear
false eyelashes then just go right ahead
Taylor wasn't really wearing any blush
so I figured this mac blush called
prison would be perfect because it gives
a really subtle look and then taking my
mac mineralize skinfinish and soft and
gentle I'm going to be applying this to
my cheekbones to highlight them and then
on my eyebrow bone the bridge of my nose
and to my Cupid's bow Taylor has fuller
lips than I do so a trick I learned is
to actually brush your lips because this
not only exfoliates them but it also
gives it a much fuller look I know it
looks really weird but if you reduce a
toothbrush over your lips it does make
them really full Taylor had a really
nice nude look on her lips so I thought
this MAC lipstick called patisserie
would be perfect for that
she also had a gloss over top so i
thought this pinkish nude color by mac
would be perfect
taylor had a really nice braided
bohemian up do so what you want to do
for this look is you're going to take a
section of your hair just behind your
ear and you're going to braid that
upwards so that it can be put around
your head I just didn't one braid
because my hair is long enough but if
you want you can do two grades one from
one side and then the second braid from
the other side and make them cross over
then I'm going to be taking the
remaining hair that's in front of the
braid and I'm going to be French
braiding that back so I'm going to
incorporate all the hair until that's on
one side of my face into the braid and
I'm going to braid that all the way back
I'm then going to be doing the same
thing on the other side but I'm going to
incorporate the braid into the bigger
French braid so that it all comes out
together
and then in the back I'm going to be
Bobby pinning the remaining braids just
kind of like into a loop and just being
messy with it it doesn't have to be
perfect it just has to be kind of messy
looking and braided so I'm just pinning
any pieces back like this and this is
the finished look really pretty bohemian
up dude I love it it's so beautiful so
that is it for the video i hope you guys
enjoyed it i had a lot of fun doing it I
love Taylor Swift I think she's
absolutely beautiful and I love all her
music and yeah I get a lot of people
