today with a very special guest me again
my boyfriend Daniel you guys all seem to
like him in the previous video that we
did called the boyfriend does my makeup
tag which I'll link down in the
description if you guys want to check
that out but we figured today we would
do the boyfriend tag because I know you
guys all like him a lot so basically the
boyfriend tag is a tag that's going
around YouTube and it's just a series of
questions that I will ask him that he's
going to answer there kind of about us
so what did I do
yeah we'll see how much he knows me and
our relationship so hopefully that'll be
good I just have my laptop here so I've
been looking down that's what I'm
looking at because I have the questions
written down and I didn't make up these
questions they were already made by
someone I don't know who started this
tag but yeah so number one where did we
meet at the pool point clear pool we
swam on the same team when we were
little and then we we she stopped
swimming and I kept swimming for a few
more years later on and then but the
first real time we met we were eight
years old and how did we meet again
because I guess that's we were eight we
weren't planning on dating so normally
count I don't know we had a mutual
friends and stuff so we just kind of
started to hang out in a group of people
like around then number two where was
our first date we went downtown for
sushi and then we went to a mountain in
Montreal called Mount Royal and there's
a lookout where you can see over the
city we just went in sat and looked at
the city at night this was last year and
in May
yeah well we weren't dating then but we
just kind of went was our first date I
guess yeah cap it was our first date but
it was funny because he's really scared
of heights so lookout probably wasn't
the best place to go because he was
freaking out and he was really scared
and it was funny because I was going
like near the edge and he was over here
whimpering like a little girl it was
cute though
number three what was your first
impression of me before we were doing or
Wednesday I needed your first impression
so when we first met like not when we
were eight because that doesn't count
because you're just like you kiddies at
that age I don't even know what a girl
was right then okay um first impression
um I thought you were really pretty
that's for sure
but to be perfectly honest I thought you
were a little ditzy I didn't know you
from an outside view that's what it look
like yeah he told me I was like a Barbie
well she had bleached blond hair super
tend low-cut shirts high all this stuff
in the summer so it was a couple summers
ago he's checking me out asshole I'll go
check me out part but the whole dip
secret number four when did you meet the
family um I met your parents the first
time I came over and we were going out
with a bunch of friends and then I met
your whole family your dad's birthday
yeah which was that your house yeah like
my aunt's will my dad's side the family
I guess I was like no I think your mom's
side was there too oh yeah they were
yeah well your instant uncle isn't here
and the funny thing is we weren't dating
at that time no we were just came over
for fun yeah cuz we were like hanging
out a lot and he had met some of my
cousins cuz I'm really close with my
cousins we're all friends and we're
hanging out with my cousin one day and I
think you just decide to stay over kind
of thing it was like during the day and
then you decide to stay later but then
all my whole family is like who is this
boy I see so biblic and you have to date
him just like number five do I have any
weird obsessions if so what probably
picking your nail polish off I'm
throwing it in the floor on the floor
not in the floor leaving a little pile
with sunbed that's really bad don't ever
do that but I have a really bad like
obsession of picking off my nail polish
it just it's so cool when you get to
like get the whole nail off in one no
number six how long have we been
together um since June so 10 months
yeah ten months yeah yeah hey that's
pretty good like officially I guess
though like ten months officially number
seven do you have a tradition with your
GF / beer so do you have a tradition
with me watching a big Amazing Race yeah
every Sunday you watch Amazing Race
actually come to think of it we watched
x-factor every week - when I was oh yeah
we used to watch X Factor which is
strange because I never used to watch
shows like that I never used to be into
like American Idol or any of those
things but I don't know why I decided to
watch it I think was because Britney
Spears was on it or something oh no I
saw a YouTube video of this girl um
what's a really good girl the one that
was she was like young early totally
rude yeah Carly Rose she was so good I
saw her audition man I was just like on
YouTube I was just like oh my gosh I
have to see the rest and so I just be
would watch it weekly and then right
into the Me's then we're into The
Amazing Race now because I watched Joey
Graceffa on YouTube and him and his
friend are on the race and it's like
Team YouTube so that's pretty cool I
like watching that every Sunday night oh
and I think also like we I guess we like
to watch movies and stuff and we go
through seasons like online so we watch
lost ones the whole season we watched
that whole series yeah sorry the whole
series number eight where was our first
road trip to New York well we went to
Quebec City yeah that's true you came
with me a few times to go to Quebec City
yeah he knows I did a semester there for
school so she would come with me in the
car it's about two and a half hours so
it's not that far I guess our first real
road trip would be New York because in
December we went to New York that was
quite a far seven hours not bad yeah we
drive well together cuz I sleep the
whole time number nine what was the
first thing you noticed about me
your good looks thanks to my guests well
it's the first thing I saw as you were
very pretty your hair it's very nice
good color yeah what do you have me I
had really long hair when he met me and
then when we started dating the first
thing I noticed was like your energy you
only noticed that we started dating well
when we start hanging out number 10 what
is my favorite restaurant hmm probably
we sushi i love sushi it's really good
number 11 what do we argue about the
most
I don't know probably um we're both
stubborn people so a lot of the times we
both have to be right even when like
sometimes it's like no no Mozart I could
not even make sense I guess like as an
example that I was thinking of before
let's say like a lot of times it's
whether it's nice I want to go out and
do something instead of you know just
stay inside and he'll be playing video
games or whatever and he'll be there
okay like let's do something what do you
want to do I'll just say hello I don't
know okay well think of something
I'm really bad at like deciding what to
do so I just can't think of it but then
I complain like I want to do something I
want to do something and he's like
getting really annoyed and then hope you
know start giving me options just feel
like man I don't really want to do that
I don't want to do that uh and then
because you're really frustrated because
he's like okay well you complain that
you won't do something you don't know
what you want to do and you don't want
to do anything I'm suggesting so what do
you want like what is my life
number 12 who wears the pants in the
relationship
I don't know I guess you thank us I'm
there if we had to decide so I feel like
we're we're really good together like we
like a lot of the same things like we
can just sit on my bed and you know
watch YouTube videos or do anything like
I'm not even talk to each other for like
hours and that's like fun for us so but
when it comes down to like real
decisions probably it's probably her
yeah I guess makes more the big
decisions but not because I have to I'm
just pretty laid back so I don't really
care what we do he goes with the flu
number 13
do you hate any of each other's exes I
don't really know yeah I'm actually one
of his exes were actually friends so how
did we forget that they dated even I
think it was a long time ago yeah even
him and like the girl forget they dated
sometimes his I think they were just
super young but um yeah I saw him with
her also and they're actually roommates
last year so or last semester with two
other guys we were all roommates
together
yeah it was pretty cool but yeah it's
weird to think that they dated because
we think back to that and you're like oh
yeah good about that and then it's other
ex I don't really know her so I can't
like hate or like her because I don't
know her but Daniels actually my first
like real legit boyfriend so because I
mean I've had like things with other
guys in the past and stuff but I mean I
say that guys like my first real
relationship that I'm happy in and

show it's so good it's everything that's
wrong with reality television oh I like
it cuz like the girls are really good at
