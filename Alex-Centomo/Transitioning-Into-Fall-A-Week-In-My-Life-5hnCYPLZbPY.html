channel I decided to do a week of my
life video this week because if you guys
don't know dad and I have a new puppy
and we're spending a lot of fun time
with him but he is currently 10 weeks
old so we're training him and doing all
these fun things so I figured why not
long because I don't do this very often
on my main channel and I feel like a lot
of you guys would want to see and also
to let you know that we are practically
daily vlogging on my vlogging Channel
Daniel this is our baby hi were you
taking a nap
so I think I'm gonna make myself some
lunch and then figure out we're gonna do
the rest of the day I did a bunch of
work this weekend so I'm pretty good on
like content for the next little bit I
think maybe we'll go out with boo and
explore a little bit today I was just in
the middle of trying to get changed for
the day I finished lunch and I realized
that it's freaking hot outside it's like
summer still for some weird reason we
had like a really bad summer and now
during the fall summer weather is like
creeping in which is fine I don't mind
it's just more like I want to wear my
fall sweaters and my black jeans and my
booties and it's freaking 35 degrees
Celsius and it's hot and I'm gonna have
to go outside and shorts
I haven't shaved my legs I have no 10
I'm just hoping it doesn't go from like
summer to winter and we don't have a
fall because that would really really
suck as I love fall it's my favorite
season I was gonna ask if you want to
like go to a cafe or something after we
boo sure go walk around somewhere a
little bit in public this week I'm not
doing anything crazy like I know a lot
of the times when people do a week in my
life it's cuz they're doing something
really exciting and they want to
document it but because I have a
blogging channel I film often on that so
usually it'll go there but at the same
time I've also just like a really
regular person and I'm not traveling I'm
staying at home I'm doing a lot of homey
things trying to organize my closet room
if you're not interested in seeing like
a regular person just kind of live their
life which totally don't blame you don't
worry about it it's completely cool I
won't judge you if you click out but if
you want to stay along for the ride and
if you like videos like this if you're
like me when you just like watching what
people do at home then totally stay
tuned also I just want to talk about how
cute this pumpkin is I love it it's just
so like quirky I found at the grocery
store and I was like imma buy that and
I'm gonna use it as a decoration I like
it I should name it this is Charlie
Brown a little outfit of the day
this is booze cray it's not gonna stay
here permanently I'm wearing this
vintage Ralph Lauren at tea from the 90s
and it's really oversized it's yellow
with these redone denim shorts and then
shoes I'm not sure yet I might just wear
my slides or like some sneakers or
something but I feel like might be too
hot for sneakers we'll see okay I
decided to wear my white Emma nmds by
adidas kind of complete the sporty vibe
when I got going on how do you rate my
outfit on the scale of one to ten it
looks good it's like a 10 a 10 for real
give me like a judgement like what do
you think would like about it good shoes
are nice jeans are nice cut a couple of
these long ones off though probably oh
we have a long strings um big baggy
t-shirt with some rips it looks good is
this your favorite crowd t-shirt on me
though no I like tight long sleeves with
stripes but not like obviously I
wouldn't go with this outfit but that's
my fault could the boy boy used took a
big poop I know we need to get him some
water
well most me I'm gonna get some water we
just sat here eating some ice cream I'm
blue came and sat right next to me up of
the picture right here it's so huge
it's wandering off we gave him a little
thing of water and actually what's
really cute about this place for Atwal
bullies and they have ice cream for dogs
which is not real ice cream it's like
something else but he's too young I
think to give him
you still enjoy his water and this
company of course everyone saying hi
because it's so cute let's go for a
little walk
it's so hot right now that we gotta put
him up and bring him back he's too tired
to walk
look he's loving the lake
he's loving it chubster look at it
so we're currently in the car I'm
sitting back here with boo because he's
so cute and he's so tired we're just
going through a draft here to get some
water and some drinks he's a little
thirsty but I can't even deal with his
cuteness
look at this bestfriend Simba
it is a beautiful morning today again
it's gonna be really hot but I literally
just put away all of my summer clothes
and my whole wardrobe right now in my
closet room is completely filled with
sweaters and jackets and long pants and
it would honestly take me like five
seconds to walk downstairs and get some
more summer stuff but I'm just like know
what I don't feel like it I mean I did
put on a t-shirt but I just tied it up
it's really like thin and stuff
sometimes I just use this as well like
pajama shirt wearing long jeans my Gucci
belt and as for shoes probably just
sneakers I always cut out my head
probably just sneakers or something I'm
driving right now I'm not driving right
now I'm about to drive to go to Kyla's
pick her up we're gonna go to the mall
because I think thousand Body Works is
having a sale with their cattles and
everything and I need to stock up
also we need soap and I want to get a
few like things from the drugstore
I need makeup removing wipes oh maybe
I'll go to Sephora actually cuz I've a a
lot of points that I kind of want to see
what I can get and I didn't pick up my
birthday gift so I should probably get
that oh my goodness I have not seen you
guys in so long do you even remember me
oh they're smelling me like crazy cuz
they probably smell boo you guys haven't
met him yet cuz he hasn't gone all his
vaccinations yet but soon it's all of it
okay I like it skunk spray
you're like a cow Oh Stewie you're still
my favorite and I'm too low now but you
had a happy life he didn't have a happy
life and then we
HM maybe we rescued you from the bad bad
night and now you have all these issues
and you open eat but you're happy right
and you're over boys so you'll need to
do some light you need to wanna do it
okay you have to see daddy stop feeding
me so much treats you tell him cake say
daddy stop I'm sorry you - I love you -
but everyone in this family loves you
more so I don't love him ignoring her

bit like scum but you smell like garbage
guys I got a try thingy with ice a chai
latte with ice and soy milk soy milk

that's yummy you at the small one I
didn't I don't know I like don't go to
Starbucks ever I feel like I'm a noob
but I just want to show Kyla's makeup
looks so pretty
no it looks good especially on camera
cuz it's more like alright mmm and I got
Sephora Bath &amp;amp; Body Works what
from a free yeah you is film me from the
worst angles is it better like this I
can't see who the screen is up I say
that you film me from the worst angles
but like I never watch it so I don't
really know Kyla okay gonna cut that out
cut it's about to start storming outside
this is crazy it's cloudy it's starting
to rain and it's getting me excited for
fall oh you're so cute I love you it's
his first time feeling it this is so
cute oh it's like really raining now
sitting on our shoes
Joe and I had a like appointment
downtown on if you guys know but dan and
I we see a therapist together and so
every Thursday we have like a therapy
appointment so it always feels just so
good to like just sit and talk and get
things out and talk to somebody who is
unbiased to anything and just knows what
they're talking about
no I just like really I'm a huge ad for
advocate for therapy I just think it's
amazing I think if you can afford it or
if where you live your health care plans
can cover it I think everyone should go
see it take like an hour a week just to
go even if you don't think you have
problems because it's not like we have
huge problems no and you don't you see a
therapist
it's like it's like people who do yoga
or something you know for meditation
purposes this is just a really good way
to figure yourself out and live like a
more well-rounded life you know just go
home
kyla is right behind me I just left the
whole car ride home I hate when that
happened just because I feel bad for
Danny just like driving alone the whole
time like but we had a podcast on so you
probably just listened to that stuff and
I have to do most what patches kids a
dog knocked into her and she fell and
like cut her knee oh she's in a lot of
pain she can't walk patches so I'm gonna
go over and help her out with that and
then I'm going out for a goodbye party
Ariana listen London guys so jealous we
are those the Topshop mom jeans No oh
they're so nice yeah and where's your
sweater from it's one of those like
random yeah it's so nice really really
cool it must be so good to like live in
Europe because you can just travel
around it's like so easy just to get
around now Amsterdam is like another one
I love mister damn
there's honestly so many countries in
Europe that I want to go yeah there's so
much more guys look how pretty this is
well also you're beautiful but look how
pretty the houses are oh my god then
where's this Colmar colemar's and
Friends oh my gosh we came outside for a
walk and it's finally chilly and I'll
keep saying it but I'm so excited I'm
like in a jacket I'm still a little bit
cold hmm
look how pretty this is once the leaves
are all changing colors it's gonna be
beautiful
Wow who are the leaves so over here is a
pretty steep hill he's getting caught I
got out of the shower I went for a run
today after I shower I'll put my hair in
braids just because it gives it some
length wave and then after that I
usually just take it out and it looks
really nice usually in a lot of my
videos or in pictures and stuff when my
hair is natural I mean it is natural but
it's I braided it beforehand and let it
dry a little bit today's been really
chill like honestly it felt so good to
kind of just do nothing just relax with
boo I went for a run I had time with
Daniel just kind of sat around and just
really took her time to just relax
sometimes I really need those days
because I get very overwhelmed and
stressed all the time so the fact that
today was one of those days just felt
really good dad said when he went to the
gym this morning it was four degrees
Celsius but that's crazy
that's really cold because what a few
days ago was like 15 in the morning so
hot I was going outside in like a tank
top and shorts and sweating and now I'm
like cold I'm not complaining though
guys you know me you know how much I
love the fall weather this vlog has been
like really hot and then gone really
cold it's gone like this and in just
this week so that's pretty cool that I
have this document in anyways I'm gonna
probably just wait for my hair to dry a
little bit and
and we'll probably head out this is my
outfit of the day you're so cute
this was sent to me today was a nice
little gift from a boutique here in
Montreal and then of course like classic
ASOS jeans I got these in the black ones
as well look at you getting so big
took my hair out as you can see it's
kind of like a little wavy in this case
when my hair is a little bit wet what I
do is I add some like sea salt spray my
current favorite right now is this one
by Gazoo this is Megan's line and it's
the wild me wave me rave me and it works
really well it's not like choo
overpowering it doesn't make your hair
crunchy or anything and I just really
like it so my hair typically dries
pretty quickly once it's out of the
braids so I don't think it's gonna take
too long it's just there's something
weird here like this look at that okay
that's annoying rate my outfit from
watch 10/10 are you just saying that are
you actually thing as a 10 oh my god
that battery's about to die sorry I
don't know anything fast but about what
you like and all about the style good
yeah would you pay your part about it
yeah
because you look good at me hey we're by
the water look how pretty this is
the sky is so nice so peaceful
you could do it we'll go boy good boy
follow daddy you want to put him down on
the first step this pause now he's all
proud can hear the plane the camera
