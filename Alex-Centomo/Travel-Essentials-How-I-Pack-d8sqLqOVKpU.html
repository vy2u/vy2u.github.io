some reason the a/c is not going in my
room that's really hard what's up guys
welcome back to my channel I've been
getting so many questions lately about
what I bring with me when I travel and
guys don't know I actually did like a
what I bring in my carry-on bag video
like maybe a year ago or something so
I'll link that down below if you guys
are curious to see that but I travel
every single month if not twice a month
so I'm constantly on airplanes and
constantly going places and I've kind of
like figured out my favorite things that
I absolutely need to have on a trip so I
thought that you guys might want to see
this few other packing or going
somewhere this summer or if you are just
going somewhere in general then maybe
these could help you I guess I'll just
get started I guess the first thing is I
use my phone for everything scheduling
notes all that kind of stuff I used to
have like a folder but I just easier for
me to have it on my phone because I'm
constantly on the go and bringing like a
notebook around is kind of inconvenient
sometimes so my phone is everything
which means that I need it charged so
this thing has been a lifesaver this
little tiny extra charger thing it's
small like a credit card so it can fit
into like the side of your person airy
thing this is to charge it in your
computer and then when you want to
charge your phone you just use the cable
that you would normally use to charge
your phone and it gives one full charge
which is perfect I don't want to wear it
got this you can literally buy these
anywhere like urban outfitters sells
them you can buy them on Amazon or Ebay
really cheap so anything like this is
like my number one need to have this
when I'm traveling because my phone dies
really quickly especially when I'm on it
a lot
number two is hygiene being on planes a
lot you're surrounded by a lot of germs
just because bacteria travels through
the air so much on airplanes hand
sanitizer that is number one making sure
you brush your teeth that is not just
good for you but it's good for people
around you that you're talking to I got
a lot of questions about this and I am a
woman so I'm going to talk about it I'm
not uncomfortable about this topic so I
don't care but what to do when you are
on your period in your traveling so I'm
I have a lot of friends that they don't
travel often and they're they always ask
me this question like what do you do
when your
babbling and you're on your period like
do you bring a whole case of pads and
tampons and which is a bat on a plane a
bubble a little blob so I figured I
would just tell you what are you I
always bring around this box this box is
a lifesaver for me so as you can tell I
travel at least once a month so there
are many times where I travel in wow my
period
these are OB tampons I'm sure a lot of
you have heard about this brand already
it's the pro comfort one silk touch and
inside comes with 18 tampons it's
regular I'm the kind of person that I'm
not very heavy on my period so regular
is perfect for me but if you feel like
you have a heavier flow you know what to
do so what I really like about these
tampons not only are they super small
and easy to use but they're very very
eco-friendly so there's no plastic
applicator at all and what's great about
this is I'll actually give you look and
I'll kind of show you this should not be
an awkward thing for you guys okay we
are all women here if you're not a woman
this is natural for a woman so I'm gonna
talk about it so this is literally the
applicator it comes in this like it's
just the actual tampon itself and
there's a string and what you do is you
actually move it like left to right
front to back to kind of open it up
because then you can actually stick your
finger in it and it protects the tip of
your finger so when you do insert it you
don't get like a bunch of stuff on your
finger I would always recommend washing
your hands beforehand anyways even when
applying a tampon another great thing
about this is that it's small it's the
actual like size of the tampon and using
your finger so this is a little weird
but you're like vaginal canal is
actually curved it's not straight so
putting in a tampon that's straight is
actually not placing it in the proper
position and my mom actually explained
this to me so inserting it with your
finger you can actually place it where
it's supposed to be so you don't feel it
at all I'm just like swinging this
tampon around you don't feel it at all
and it's very comfortable and I just
really like that it's made up of like
90% of raw materials from renewable
resources so that just makes it me feel
a lot more comfortable putting something
in my body if that makes any sense I'll
have a link for this listed down below
if you are curious to check it out
there's also like a fact like a
frequently asked questions page if you
have questions about the application all
that kind of stuff
tells you everything you need to know so
leave it down below on - I guess keeping
with the whole hygiene thing this is
more for like other people so you don't
smell that for them but these two things
very important so deodorant and cream
like hand cream body cream I get very
dry on airplanes so this is I mean it's
always good to moisturize no matter
where you're going I always usually
bring carry-on size things so something
like this is like small it's under 100
mils perfect to fit in like your
carry-on stuff you have it with you so
when you're on a plane you can kind of
just like massage it in and it's great
for that this sometimes when I go to the
bathroom I'll just bring this and kind
of like you know so I don't stink when
I'm in the bathroom I also like to kind
of rinse off my face I've never actually
brought a face mask but when I went to
Bali tests had face masks with her and I
was like that is such a good idea I have
yet to try it so I will let you know on
that but I always bring like makeup
removing wipes or even just wet wipes to
just kind of rinse off your face when
it's like when you're on a long-haul
flight it just gets all gross and stuff
and I just like to kind of wipe my face
off or if you know I'll end and I'm just
like in the bathroom quickly I kind of
just like it's like washing your face
but not really it's just kind of like
wiping off all the excess like dirt oil
and all that kind of gunk that gets on
there from the plane and stuff and then
this is a lip balm this is very
important for me I get very dry lips and
I feel like I need to have this
everywhere with me you can have any kind
of lip balm doesn't matter this one is
from gloss here it's the rose balm calm
and it has a little tint of like pink so
it adds a little bit of color to your
lips which I like super moisturizing by
the way it's crazy and this is just like
a Neutrogena thing these are my sisters
they're in the bathroom just now but I
always buy these ones or I get like the
actual wet wipes in the travel size
version that are for sensitive skin
because I've very sensitive skin and
what I'll normally do is I'll wash my
hands in the bathroom take the wet wipe
wipe my face and then rinse my face
another thing that I will always travel
with are these to-go containers so I
always fill them up with either my
shampoo can
face cream face wash toner anything like
that I put them in these things because
it's just simple to have a bunch of the
small ones and rather these huge ones
that can spill in your bag and stuff and
I put all these in like a separate
ziploc bag so that it's in case for
whatever reason this breaks it doesn't
get all over my clothes or books or
whatever oh yeah this is I guess is
another smelling good one but some kind
of perfume body mist body spray and I
got travel size this one's from scent
bird but I mean you can buy any kind of
like travel sized thing but that's like
optional just to kind of spray your body
I typically use this for when I get off
the plane or if I get out of a car out
of a train after a long time I kind of
just like go to the bathroom freshen up
and it's very very small as you can see
so it fits right into a purse everything
I take is very like small just because I
like to bring a lot of things and so the
smaller the better because then I could
just fit it all and it doesn't take up
much room things like this are
lifesavers so anytime I buy like
sunglasses or bracelets jewelry they
come in like little pouches or they come
in little boxes and I always keep those
things because when I travel it's
perfect for that so let's say it for
example something like this it's just
like cloth material but I'll put in all
my jewelry into this like not my like
chains and stuff that one I'll keep them
like a separate box just so it doesn't
get tangled but jewelry like you know
velvet chokers different kinds of
chokers like the wire ones bracelets
I'll just kind of throw them in here tie
it together and it makes it so that they
don't move around your suitcase and then
when I get to my destination I can use
this for other things like if I go to
the beach and I don't want this to get
sandy I'll put that in here in my beach
bag it's just very smart to keep these
around so this one is from Free People
but I mean you can literally get pouches
like this of the dollar store so there's
no reason it's just because I have them
because I got some sunglasses from Free
People so I was sent that but for me
it's just smart to have because I use it
all the time next this tunnel not
everyone likes to take medication when
they have headaches or migraines or
anything like that I bring these mainly
for cramps
so if I have cramps when I'm on vacation
it sucks big time and this just really
helps it's the extra strength I just
take one
and I'm able to do whatever throughout
the day and I feel a lot better
headphones so when I'm traveling I love
to listen to music I love to listen to
podcasts headphones are definitely a
must these are just the iPhone ones but
if you do want to invest in something
better which I actually do recommend
especially if you are editing or really
to be focused on what you're listening
to and you don't want other people to
hear something like big headphones are a
must or not a must but are like a luxury
I guess so these ones are from Bose
they're just like the big headphones I
keep them in this always just because
it's easy to travel with but if I'm
editing on a plane and I put these on it
cancels out all background noise and I
can just focus on what I'm doing and
this came as a lifesaver coming back
from Bali because it was a 13-hour
flight one of our flights was a 13 hour
flight and there was a screaming child
the whole time so I put these on I just
put on a little like noise canceling
thing and I heard nothing I just watched
my movies it was great it was the best
thing ever so these ones don't really
cancel out anything background noise but
they're still they do the job I mean I
use these for years before I bought this
this one is just like luxury like I'm
like oh my god thank you for this the
two last things this is kind of like a I
guess a common-sense thing but I have so
many friends that forget this when
they're traveling and I always have
extras any kind of like hairband
scrunchie hair elastic ponytail whatever
to put your hair up when you're
traveling
I just always keep a bunch of these in
my bag because you never know when
someone's gonna need it last thing is a
good book so I I don't know I just don't
like reading books on my computer on my
phone I've tried I just like physical
copies better I'm just like not on that
bandwagon yet I don't listen to
audiobooks either I'm just not there I
like physical copies of books so this is
the one I have been reading lately it's
by Mimi icon she is a fellow youtuber
and she actually sent me a few of her
books but I bought her book beforehand
so so excited about it she'd been
talking about it for so long and this is
the bingo theory and guys if you want
like any kind of a relationship advice
self advice work advice and
anything like that read this book this
you will not only learn about other
people but you will learn about yourself
it is so good it's called a
revolutionary guide to love life and
relationships it's so good so any kind
of book but I would recommend I'll leave
the link to the Amazon link down below
if you're curious about it I really
respect her for writing this and she is
such an amazing person her and Alex like
every time I see them and every time I
leave like London or wherever I'm
whenever I'm with though I just feel
like I've learnt so much about myself as
a person and I think that is everything
if you guys have any recommendations for
things leave them down the comments

each other out with packing and stuff
