yeah okay you know when you're just
having those days you're just like yeah
what's up guys welcome back to my
channel I'm so excited to do a haul for
you today you have no idea haul videos
are literally my favorite and I have
feel like I haven't done one in a long
time like a legit collective haul where
I've gone out and got some cute gray
sweaters I just wanted to some
explaining I actually recently like went
through my whole closet and took a bunch
of stuff and just donated to charity or
brought it to the Salvation Army I
recently got rid of a bunch of stuff so
I went shopping yes I know it's bad it's
bad
also I want to say stay tuned till the
end because I have a big surprise for
you guys
and dog skip forward please watch the
video so I think the first thing I'm
going to start off before the clothing
I'm going to start off with my
subscription bag or my script subscript
subscription box service so if you guys
didn't know which I'm sure a lot of you
are aware already but I have a
subscription I can't say that word I
have a subscription box or bag because
it comes in a bag full of like beauty
products and accessories and just like
fun things that I designed for you guys
and I put a lot of hard work into it and
it comes out monthly and it's just so
great it's so fun I've gotten so much
feedback from you guys already of how
much you love it so I'm going to open
this one for you guys to show you what's
in this month's bag so the first thing I
have for you guys is a T this is toffee
chocolate hazelnut oh my god oh my god
I don't you guys can see from here so
along with the T comes little teabags
because I know a lot of my friends
actually don't have that thing that you
put in the tea when you have like loose
tea so it comes with a few little tea
bags really cute you just put them in
your tea cup you actually fill your tea
cup with or coffee mug whatever with
boiling water or really hot water then
you put the tea in the tea bag and then
you just dip it in the water and you let
it steep for around I'd say three to
four minutes but if you like it stronger
you can keep it in for longer if you
don't like it as strong you don't have
to then my favorite thing to do is add a
little bit of almond milk and honey it
tastes so good and just like a dash of
cinnamon mmm forgot to say this but you
also get a card that explains everything
that's in it and what I like about it
and just that kind of stuff the next
thing you will be receiving if I can
open it it's a little bath melt so you
guys know I'm obsessed with lush and I
recently came out with bath bomb which
was really awesome you guys all seem to
love it so I came out with a bath melt
this is a pumpkin pie flavor
it smells ridiculous and look how cute
this packaging is so that's the next
thing you will be getting you have two
things that make up the first one being
this blush it's so nice this color so it
looks like this it looks very bright on
camera but it's more of a plum color so
pretty I love it so much it's called
deep plum blush that was my phone and
it's so flattering especially during the
winter I think this looks perfect I mean
it's cute this summer too but its wonder
for me right now so that's why I chose
this color love it it's more of a matte
color so what I would do is I dip your
brush in gently and then build it up
instead of putting like swirling your
brush in it you know the last thing
you'll be getting is a lipstick color I
love this color so much this is called
Alex and Tomo deep rush red so it looks
like this it's just a deep red color so
flattering so nice so I hope you guys
enjoy this one a lot I'm so excited
about those products because they're
just some of my favorites and if you're
interested in subscribing to my
subscription box service I'll have a
link listed down below as well as an e
mail for you guys too if you have any
questions or if like let's say you want
to know how long it takes to ship to
your area you can email that down below
and yeah let's get into the clothing
haul so the first thing I'm going to
talk about is brandy melville because I
literally am obsessed you guys know that
I worked at the store for a very long
time and I used to buy their clothes all
the time I don't get the discount
anymore because I don't work there but
their clothing is not that expensive
it's pretty affordable the quality is so
soft like sometimes I pick up a shirt
and I'm just like is this air like it
doesn't make sense to me but I want to
talk about two things and I'm literally
obsessed with and you guys if you're
gonna buy anything from brandy to buy
these things so like gray sweatpants and
a sweatshirt so these are the sweatpants
they're super baggy and so freakin soft
I thought there was a spider on my
ceiling oh my god let's go these are so
soft they're very thin I don't know how
to explain them other than like they're
flimsy and soft and it feels like a
cloud and you just like need to try this
and this is the matching sweater so it's
like as if up hoodie and it's really
baggy and so cute there's dog hair
flowing everywhere I'm so sorry guys oh
my god I am in love with this set I
don't wear it together even though I did
the other day cuz I was just chilling
but you know if you're going out don't
wear them together because it looks a
little bit like circa 2008 with the
Juicy Couture track suits ya know next
thing I got is a tight turtleneck
long-sleeve shirt it's all black it's
just a simple long-sleeve turtleneck I
used to have one from brandy that was a
different material but it really got
stretched out like around the neck area
like the turtleneck is like this wide
now I don't understand so I decide to
get this one it's so comfy and so flimsy
and soft and um it's like a ribbed
material so it's not that thin but it's
not that thick it's been between that me
no sense I then got just a simple white
cropped t-shirt that's just like
literally a simple white cropped t-shirt
same material is that black turtleneck I
just showed you I just needed something
white and simple that was cropped that
was more of this type of material
because I have a lot of loose-fitting
wines but nothing that
like tight so I just need something like
that because I have an outfit in mind
that I want to style when I'm away and I
needed something like that Plus this was
pretty cheap it was 20 bucks not bad
then the next thing I got wasn't just
another great t-shirt this one is like
mostly to sleep in but I really liked
that it's in Malibu on it I thought it
was so cute and these style t-shirts are
just very flattering on me I have more
broader shoulders and like bigger arms
because I was a swimmer so like I find
these t-shirts just are nice on my body
type I don't know why it just looks cute
so I'm excited to wear that when I have
a tan because this color with a tan and
blonde hair just looks so frickin good
I mean brunette hair - but I'm blonde so
that's why I think that way then I got
one last thing which was just a simple
mock neck like white I don't know how to
explain this material
it's like stretchy and fluffy and soft
its cream-colored and it's not very long
so I would wear it with something
high-waisted I was thinking of wearing
this with like high-waisted mom jeans
and sneakers I thought it was very Gigi
Hadid and I love her so much so I like
steal her style all the time literally I
go on this website called Gigi Hadid
closet or something I don't know I
literally googled Gigi Hadid closet and
the first website that popped up it
shows her and Bella and it's like all of
their clothes what they wear and then
what I do is I find cheaper alternatives
or like similar things I got brand new
or Target or you know forever 21 and
then I I dress like them because I'm
hoping the way they dress then I did
some shopping at Free People if you guys
are from Canada but especially live in
like the Toronto area they have that new
store opening up in the Eaton Center
really soon I'll have all the details
listed down below it's so exciting I am
so jealous because I want a free evil
store to open in Montreal so bad very
jealous I'll have the details listen
down below for those of you that live
around that area I suggest you go and
check it out and go to the opening
because I'm very jealous I might show up
I'm just just letting you know so the
first thing I got um which I was
actually I showed this before
it's a cropped sweater it's gray of
course of course of course this is in my
monthly favorites
I wouldn't wearing this a ton it's so
cute with like high-waisted my
high-waisted black jeans from Paige
denim
but then the next thing I got was this
super deep V like black acid wash T so
you can see right like the deep that V
is very deep
so you guys know I'm all about that wow
I am so washed out what is this lighting
today oh okay oh yeah so cute I am
thinking with a 10 this will look a lot
better than it does now I should just
get another spray tan but I'm getting
one before I go away so the next thing I
got was this turtleneck oh my goodness
okay I'm going to show this
it's a turtleneck it's like kind of
cropped ish but it's longer in the back
and it has these like really wide short
sleeves okay can we just talk about how
wide I am right now this is a really
cute color even though it looks so
bright on camera I swear it's just a
good deep plum with a dark purple color
and it's so flattering cannot wait to be
10 and wear all these sweaters then the
last oh no there's two I lied there's
two more gray things so this one I
actually am giving it to my mom because
she's honestly obsessed with it and to
be quite honest I don't need another
gray sweater even though it's so cute I
might use it for a picture and then give
it to her
it's got like long bell sleeves and it's
like a sweater dress so it's pretty long
I think that's what high-waisted
high-waisted boots what thigh high boots
whoa would be really cute so um this is
for you mama she's gonna be so happy and
then the last thing I got which I born a
ton as well is this long-sleeve like
really stretchy material um deep v top
it's really cute I had it tucked into
high-waisted jeans with some cute
sneakers and I had like those strappy
bras that have all like the straps
everywhere so since it's deep V you can
see all this job so it was really cute
and I really liked it a lot so that is
everything that I've purchased recently
that was grey and a sweater I actually
got one more thing but it's hanging to
dry right there should I get it it's wet
but I want to show you
so this was actually sent to me from
garage the people at garage they're
awesome this um is just a simple T it's
gray and it's swingy and it's so cute I
also got leggings but there on the
banister drawing because I were I
actually wore that full outfit and I got
socks too
I love garage they've really stepped up
their game I said that when I wore their
stuff to Osheaga in the summer but they
have stepped up their game I mean I used
to shop there all the time when I was
like in grade eight so I was a youngster
but now they have stuff that I love so
