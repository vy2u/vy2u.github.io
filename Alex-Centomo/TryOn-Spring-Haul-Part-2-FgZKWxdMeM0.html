channel if you've been subscribed for
even just a few weeks you would know
that I had recently put on a haul but I
asked you guys in that video in the
description if you want to see a part
two because I was having a lot more
shipments and I do a lot of online
shopping it's not the best but a ton of
you guys said yes you would like to see
that so I have compiled just a few
things that I have been getting lately
that I know a ton of you want to see so
a lot of this stuff is actually I got it
for my trip to Paris if you guys don't
know if you don't follow me on any
social media I'm actually in Paris right
now as you're watching this video
because this is going up on a Saturday I
am so excited I want to go there for so
long literally my room is Paris theme
and it's been a place that I've been
wanted to go for so long and so I'm
going on my boyfriend and I'm just
really excited so I'm just gonna get
started first thing I want to show you
is this hat I love this hat so much I'm
excited to wear this there's dog fur on
it that's cute it looks like this I
think it's cute it's got a little like
western vibe going on it's a fedora but
I think this would be perfect even just
like for like a beach vacation I think
it's so cute but especially for Paris
this is from the company called Bailey
hats and just like a straw material it's
really sturdy so like you can't really
move it around which I like when it
comes to hats and I think it looks great
so I'm excited to rock this I'll
actually wearing this on the planes that
I want to pack this and it get all
ruined next thing is from Nasty Gal
and i got this a while ago but I
actually have not showed it in a haul
yet so I wasn't sure if I was gonna keep
it or return it but then I tried it on
with a specific outfit that I'm gonna be
wearing in Paris and I loved it so it
looks like this it's just like a brown
moto jacket it's a little bit cropped in
the back you can actually at these draw
strings that you can pull um I don't
really like the sleeves cuz they have
these weird velcro things on I wish you
could take them off but it looks really
cool when it's all together and I really
like the way this actually fits on me
and it's got a nice zipper and yeah it's
cute it's a cool brown color I don't own
anything like this so I thought I would
kind of switch it up a little bit and go
outside my comfort zone
and I'm liking it from did I say I was
from Nasty Gal I totally lied it's from
Urban Outfitters and I got it on the
Urban Outfitters website I'm so sorry
that is
offered okay I'm sorry that I keep
touching my hair it's just literally
driving me crazy
next we'll go into brandy melville
because you guys all love brandy so much
so the first thing is actually something
I worn my outfit of the week video from
last weekend and it's just this simple
white crop tea I have actually yet to
wear this out I just used it for the
video because I really liked it I saw
the tag on it but it's really soft
material it's just a crop white tee that
says Los Angeles California on it and in
the back it has the same kind of thing
just bigger and yeah I like the fit of
this a lot super soft then I got a tank
that's not blurry at all okay then I got
a tank it looks like this it just has
buttons in the front to go down and it's
just like a simple white tank top that's
super light and comfy and soft I got
this manly four things that I want to
like layer and stuff so I really like it
then I got two of the same t-shirts just
some different colors the first one is
this color and this is like a blueish
purple I want to say it's just a crop
tee that has kind of like these weird
sleeves but they're not full tee shirts
but it's not a muscle tee I don't know
how to explain this it's just simple and
I mean that's my favorite thing about
Brandi just the simplicity so then I got
the exact same shirt in this color like
a light baby dusty blue and I thought
these looked really cute I just couldn't
decide which I'm which one I liked
better so I got both and I actually wear
these without a bra because they're
really tight and I think it's flattering
that way this with like high-waisted mom
jeans and some basic white sneakers and
a bomber jacket or sweater or something
is so cute like a cardigan sweater I
really like that look lately so that's
what I've been shopping for then I got a
few things off of ASOS and I showed it
in my outfit of the week video but it's
actually in the wash right now but it's
just that oversized sweater from
champion I'll just insert a clip of me
wearing it that I used in the video it's
just really comfortable and oversized
and baggy and I really like it a lot and
then I also got this t-shirt from ASOS
this shoe is actually supposed to be for
Daniel when I came in the mail it looked
nothing like how it looked on the
website and I hate when that happens but
then it actually turned out to be a
positive because I tried it on just for
fun and it's actually such a cute like
bathing suit cover-up like it's really
baggy and almost looks like a dress you
can wear a bathing suit
I'll just keep it looks like this it's
got like an open neckline and long
sleeves and this is a weird thing look
look this is supposed to be a men's
shirt but who's like what men's shirt
goes like that on the ends so this is
turning out to be mine I'm going to be
wearing it in Bali over my bikinis and I
got a few things from Windsor so the
first one that being this like crochet
looking um tank that's crop it's so cute
and it's actually really low down so
it's super flattering in the chest area
and the back cause it's really low in
the back yeah I really really like it a
lot that is one thing that I'm super
stoked about wearing all throughout the
summer then I got this really nice okay
this is all tangled hold on so it's this
top is really it's like a high neckline
and it's one of those halter tops that
ties in the back with like the bow
things but then it crosses in the back
it's really pretty I like it a lot and
then the last thing I got from Windsor
is just a simple white tee that I have a
specific outfit in mind so then I got
two things from revolve one being a pair
of shorts and one being a belt so I just
tried it on before because it just came
in the mail that's why the belt is still
on the pair of shorts they both look
like this so high-waisted denim shorts
they're from the brand called girlfriend
or GRL fr nd and I think it's strictly a
revolve thing that they're doing these
are the Cindy high-waisted jeans and
then this is a like a small belt from
below the belt just looks like this
super cute by the way I know I'm gonna
get a ton of questions about this the
lipstick that I'm wearing is kylie
jenner it's the Kylie lip kit in Dolce K
and I did overlined my lips and I love
it okay I forgot I actually had a few
more things I want to show you so I got
this top from Free People it's just a
high neckline really loose tank top goes
down pretty low but I really liked it
because the back is super open back like
that and you actually wear the high neck
part in the front so I thought this
would be super cute and volley then I
got a pair of overalls from ASOS ooh and
they look like this so they're just
simple your simple pair of overalls
they're black and they go all the way
down to your ankles they're a little bit
looser on the ends and they're super
flattering really open on the sides they
have this
nice zipper detailing that goes down the
back looks like this and I think they're
super cute and I'm a huge fan of
overalls then the last thing I want to
show you guys is actually my favorite
out of everything that I got and it is
this really cool bomber jacket so it's
like a metallic silvery greenish color I
don't know how to describe it but it's
so cute it's from urban its urban slash
unit together so it's just like a really
cool color and simple bomber shiny and I
really like it I don't know why I'm just
a huge fan of this so I'm all for it if
