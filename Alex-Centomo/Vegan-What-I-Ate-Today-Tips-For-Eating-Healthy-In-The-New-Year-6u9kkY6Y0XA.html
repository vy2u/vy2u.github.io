my channel I don't know what I just did
with my leg I was like welcome back to
my channel I'm here again on my blogging
camera I couldn't really like this style
of filming it's like my favorite thing
right now
okay guys real talk now the holidays are
always hard because my puppies the
holidays always a great time because you
get together with family you can't eat
whatever you want it's just a good time
but then once the holidays are over life
sets in you're like crap and you hit the
gym and you start eating healthy it's
always difficult to kind of get back
into a routine of things and to be
honest I took December the whole month
of December to just kind of be like
whatever and do what I wanted when it
came to food and working out and it was
just my month of like chill so this
month I was like you know what I need to
get a puppy just kidding I need to get
my life back on track and start eating
better start hitting the gym again 2018
make account I cut my finger last night
while chopping some peppers a lot of you
guys like to see what I eat in a day and
there's some of my favorite videos to
film I'm gonna do them more often help
motivate you guys give you some cool
recipe ideas just show you guys what I
eat on a typical day given I do not eat
proper a hundred percent of the time
everything in moderation I feel like I
always say that in every video but it's
true for me I just like to eat food that
has a lot of flavor that's very
wholesome especially in the winter when
it's freezing cold literally snowstorm
right now inside imma show you some
ingredients so my key ingredients that I
have been loving for cooking and doing
my own thing so I use this website
called thrive market because it has a
lot of really organic and wholesome food
stuff that's really good for you and you
can order whatever it is it comes
involved it just makes it a lot easier
than having to drive 40 minutes to the
grocery store for basic things because I
love kind of far so these are the few
things that I have been loving right now
like my core ingredients and a lot of
these something that I use almost on a
daily so this is actually a new thing to
me I haven't used it yet but I want to
start making some wellness shots and I
know apple cider vinegar is very very
good for you so I have yet to try this
but this is something that I really want
to experiment with you guys know how I
feel about Clif bars so I just you know
eat one of these every time I'm like out
and about doing things they kind of keep
me in between meals
keeping me satisfied I love the white
chocolate macadamia nut flavor it's my
favorite
steel-cut oatmeal this is the best
non-gmo real good for you real outs
oatmeal is like the best thing for
breakfast because it's simple it's easy
to do it's filling and it's really
healthy these we'll talk about later
this is what I'm going to be making for
breakfast so I mean I have this raw
organic protein which I have yet to try
but you guys know that I have my protein
shakes every morning after the gym and a
lot of you guys were commenting saying
it wasn't the best for me and that I
should get raw organic protein and so I
got the chocolate flavor and this is it
splat formula so it's real good I mean
you can read it here it's all vegan
dairy-free soy-free these things I've
been a fan of since I was a kid my mom
used to have them all the time but these
are organic rice cakes they're lightly
salted they're with brown rice they're
gluten free and vegan non-gmo real good
and then this I'm excited to try this is
Justine's chocolate hazelnut butter oh
my gosh
so I am partnering with thrive Mike
wrote for this video I just want to say
huge thank you to them they are an
American company and I just don't want
to stress that because I know I get a
lot of comments asking sometimes why I
promote American companies but that's
because majority of you guys are
American and so I just feel like it
benefits you guys I'm Canadian but I'm
in the States all the time I'm just
letting you guys know this is an
American company so you guys aren't
surprised if you check out the link
below but thrive market is offering a
really good deal so I will have the
details listed down below for you guys
to check out definitely if you guys are
interested in doing groceries for
yourself on things that are very healthy
very tasty very good for you and I would
definitely check it out so the biggest
reason why I love thrive market other
than the fact that it's all a hundred
percent raw organic really really
healthy and good for you it's so
affordable like literally I saved so
much money using this versus going to
the grocery store everything on their
site is like 25 to 50 percent off so
you're getting a really really good deal
another really great thing is the fact
that thrive markets not only sells our
stuff at real organic non-gmo prices
rather than like the retail price that
they sell at the grocery store but for
everyone that signs up they do donate a
membership to a low income veteran or a
teacher that way just kind of helping
people that can't afford something like
this be able to and making healthy
eating a lot more
portable because I know that's like the
main thing I hear from a lot of people
is how eating healthy is so expensive oh
my gosh it's so much easier just to like
buy unhealthy food because it's cheap
that is not the case at all
not true the last thing I want to say
before I get into what I'm making for
breakfast is the fact that everything on
their website is detailed so you can see
what's in every single ingredient that
you're getting anything that you want to
buy tells you everything that's in it
how good it is for you and that just
makes eating healthy especially if
you're new to it really simple really
easy and you'll learn a lot so I thought
it was really helpful for myself because
I obviously am NOT an expert and it just
helped me by the way that's a toboggan
back there if you guys are confused as
to what that orange thing is without
further ado let's just get into what I'm
making for breakfast okay first of all
this stuff smells so good so it's not
like chocolate yeah true cuz usually we
use like almond butter or peanut butter
you've never tried anything chocolate
salty and that's really good so Kat Bell
is here for lunch and we're making
ourselves a really nice healthy wrap
because we've just been feeling the like
post-holiday nächsten detox yeah
exactly so the ingredients we've decided
on today is this roasted red pepper
hummus it's so good it's by this brand I
don't really know much about hummus in
general but I just know the taste of
this one is so good these are the wraps
100% whole grain whole wheat tortillas I
like these ones the thin ones because
they're easy to like roll up so you can
make like I don't know really filled
wrap versus a pita bread which is kind
of more for dipping I think and then as
for lettuce we're using baby kale and
also baby spinach then I think we should
cut up some pepper do you want your
orange yellow we got some cherry
tomatoes which are red and orange and
then a good trick to wrap is you fold up
the bottom and then you do one and then
two
but you know it's like a little blanket
you can bite into it look how good that
looks
look Sammy come at that looks so good
and then ask for a snack we're gonna opt
for the
two grain tortilla chips which I got
from a thrive market
I find dipping knees and hummus so yummy
but you can just having them on their
own because they're just full of flavor
okay guys dinnertime we are making a
vegetarian chili this is my absolute
favorite thing to make when the days are
cold you want some good hearty meals but
you don't you want to be kind of
somewhat healthy get all your nutrients
to have it be super flavorful you are
eating a really good home-cooked meal
but doesn't take long
so cat is chopping up the onions these
are all the ingredients basically we
just have two carrots bell pepper
jalapenos we have two different kinds of
beans some tomato sauce and some real
Tomatoes garlic balsamic vinegar
vegetable broth and then these are all
the spices I'm gonna be using so like
thyme salt some mrs. - chili obviously
cumin turmeric paprika and curry powder
and we're missing celery but I think I'm
just gonna put an extra tomato and like
extra this and make it well-balanced but
basically it's all the ingredients you
need and then I'm gonna be using a
coconut oil to kind of heat up and saute
the onions and everything I find coconut
oil is literally the best thing to use
when doing anything cooking for your
skin I literally use this for booze
pause in the winter like we just kind of
rub it in our hands and put it on his
paws so that it protects from the snow
and the salt and the all the stuff
that's outside that hurts is pause yeah
I got this off of thrive market as well
and it's really good it's organic real
good coconut oil you can use this on
your skin on your hair literally
everything okay so we got the coconut
oil in the pan or the pot whatever just
big sauce thingy
I make soup in this on medium heat I'm
gonna be melting and they're gonna add
all the ingredients so we're cooking all
of the ingredients right now we need to
let it come to a boil and then we let it
simmer with the top on for around 45
minutes to let it absorb everything get
nice and thick
oh man that's gonna be so good guys this
