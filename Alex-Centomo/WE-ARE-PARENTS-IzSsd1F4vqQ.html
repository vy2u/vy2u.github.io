channel if you guys aren't following me
on any social media and you're not
subscribed to our blogging channel then
you will not know that we have a little
surprise for you guys
it's boo we're parents
my buddy so this is boo you see him he's
a little floppy yeah you know like let
him play on the bed yeah God is he's got
his little Simba toy and he's got his
little blue he's a full golden retriever
and he's gonna be nine weeks soon but
yeah he's a little baby he's so cute so
I asked you guys on Instagram to ask
your questions about him and we're just
gonna go through him because I know a
lot of you guys have questions
especially if you guys watch our daily
vlogs or somewhat daily vlogs we have
filmed a bunch with boo and it'll on you
and so many questions if you want to
subscribe to us on that channel I'll
have like a little thing here you can
click and also down below in the
description oh my gosh you might hear
him going crazy in the background but
that's because he's enjoying this thing
yeah pull up the bed though so
underscore him chica I'm gonna have your
like names here because I pronounced it
wrong asked are you planning on getting
more dogs because I know you want to
love you uh for now no I mean we
probably will in the future I don't I
don't think we never go over to probably
but in the future we'll probably get
another one yeah especially when he gets
older so we have a friend but we're not
going to get like two puppies because
this is also our first puppy together as
a couple so we want to make sure that
yeah but for now
like Adam no no but eventually so Shan
Calvert I love you by the way she's so
sweet she always comments on everything
she says is boo gonna be part of the
wedding day we actually talked about
that he'll definitely be there we don't
know if like what role he'll play
because we already have ring bearers we
already have we already have flower
girls I don't know we can make them like
an honorary groomsmen
he likes to play it we can make him like
an honorary groomsman or we hit ask
someone special who's not in the wedding
party to walk him down the aisle and you
know like I don't know we'll figure it
out but he'll definitely be there yeah
it's just a matter of how involved he'll
be he's our baby okay so the next one
comes from Najia Martin and they asked
why did you decide now is the right time
to have who slash a dog
I feel like it's always been the right
time no but we've always wanted one and
now is the right time because we've been
living on our own for a year we just
felt ready we're old enough I think it's
also because we got the okay
yeah we got the other more landlords
yeah we weren't allowed for the first
year so when we resigned the lease we
were like right away yeah
really okay we're getting a dog and yeah
underscore Ling asked did you have a
hard time choosing between adopting a
puppy or a shelter animal love you I
really don't agree with like reading
readers who like pump out dogs you know
really not for that I definitely want to
adopt like in the future and stuff well
I mean I guess it's all adopting right
and like you're adopting a puppy versus
adopting a shelter like this this was
this was my reasoning is that he was
born on a farm but not AIDS no no like a
farm farm like farmers who have fruits
and vegetables and they had a litter and
if they weren't gonna find homes for
them then they were gonna be they were
gonna be put in shelters and they can't
can't take care of 8 dogs you know so by
us adopting him it's just like as if
he'd gone to a shelter and then we
adopted him you know yes we knew her so
I think that's it wasn't like a store
that you just go and you yeah exactly it
was more like a personal thing and it
just it was like perfect honestly I
think there was something in universe
just just like made it work yeah just
knew we wanted a little if you don't
adopt puppies don't lend up in shelters
you know and then it's just another
shelter animal as someone has to a dogs
like why are people so horrible tom was
like I just don't understand it really
bothers me and I don't want to think
about any marks with something that's
right Amanda
10 26 26 asked what was the process of
picking boo and did any of your friends
or family peoplewe siblings like buzz
and Nala so if you guys are not familiar
with Zooey
Elfi they have a black pug named Nala
and then I think they adopted the
brother and gave it to like his mom or
something so they kept in the family so
none of our family members did that
because no no one's like really in a
place to get a dog right now
her parents already have two my sister
my sister has one my brother has a cat
my parents have a cat when I asked I
asked but no one's really in that place
right now to be able to take on the
responsibility of a new dog
I wanted them all trust me as dad I was
like I did not want to leave with one
yes she had a hard time thinking and
then what was the first part of the
question that said what was the process
of picking boo uh like picking out him
out of a litter that was hard - yeah we
went to visit twice just just to get to
know the dogs and see we went at five
weeks and then at six and a half weeks
and we just like to invest yeah we had a
good personality he was very
affectionate he also would come to us a
lot that said he was very affectionate
with us you come he sit on our laps he
cozy up beside us he'd smell us he's
like our fingers where some of the other
dogs were either too crazy and
independent and running around barking
or to sort of quiet just sitting in the
little pen by themselves so it was nice
that he was a good mix and he was really
really friendly so that's why we like we
actually brought Tim and Kyla and Kyla
Kyla loves the runt
usually of the letters so she like
picked up a little one that was always
sleeping and she was just holding in the
hold
and because where we live here you're
not have more than two dogs that gets
against the city rules so my sister
lives at home with my parents so and
they already have two dogs yeah so
definitely be illegal and they would get
fined a crazy time yeah I don't know
what the law is but like they would
probably get keep getting fines until
they gave one up but she's I mean the
woman said like she's gonna be able to
find home yeah it's not like she's just
gonna throw him in a shelter like she
knows a lot of people and she'll be able
to find them homes it was more just I
was I was so hard to like leave with
just him but he was already so
independent like wasn't depending on his
mom at all because the next one comes
from Taylor Cam underscore and she asked
did you meaning Alex or Dan pick the
name for your new puppy or was it mutual
it's actually a pretty good story we had
a few names in mind but nothing just
really felt that right and then one day
her parents were over and on like a big
box that had come in the mail it said
boo I got to remember what the clock was
like to scare it though you know yeah
like a surprise and her dad was like hey
why don't you name it boo and then we're
like she loves to kill a mockingbird and
so Boo Radley is like he's a really cool
character and so I just sort of fit and
we're like we both sort of look to each
other oh really that's so good that
that's perfect
plus it's like boo like a little ghost
you know all right it's just really good
and we like we thought boo the golden
sounded really nice and he's just so
cute I don't know it really fixed a
reoccurring question I saw a lot was
he's so young like why'd you take him so
young kind of thing like he should be
with his mom for a later age I agree in
a sense specific dogs for sure and the
longer they're with their mom the better
obviously but they were already so
independent of their mom like they
weren't milking from her anymore they're
eating their kibble already they did
they would sleep as a pack like the kids
and stuff but they don't depend on their
mom anymore and I know for social things
it's probably good but at the same time
like where his mom now and one thing
that's really good is the younger you
get a dog this is what I've seen not too
young no no no not when there's still
like I think a eight is supposed to be
the minimum
eight is the youngest eight to ten is
pretty good it's also easier to teach
them independence when they're that
young because dogs are pack animals but
pet dogs you have to train them that
they're okay to be alone because they
are gonna be alone they're at home they
don't have a pack anymore but they are
we're their pack but sometimes we have
to leave rich what a work so as he gets
older he has to understand like hey I
can just sit here by myself and be
perfectly calm
they're also eventually be okay with
other dogs too and yeah Bok was
socializing but if you were to take a
dog that lived in a pack his whole life
at like three years and then just start
leaving him alone he would freak out
right he would not be okay with that
so starting at a really young age helps
them learn that independence it's not a
bad thing I mean that's what that's what
host pets are great and he's so happy
he is so happy he's just like loving
life so Devorah sir--my asks how are you
planning to travel now that you have foo
are you going to travel less often for
now we're not traveling as much because
he's a baby and you want to make sure
that we're with him as much as possible
I'm spending as much quality time with
him and really training him properly
because we want him to be like a really
well-behaved dog
it's something that is very important to
us but it's important to him to write a
well-trained dog it means a not anxious
dog yeah a badly trained dog is an
anxious dog and he's not okay being
alone he's not okay being left you'd be
very like separation anxiety you know so
a well-trained dog is really good for
him
not only just for us oh yeah it's really
good for the dogs mental health and then
when we do start traveling if we do have
it like for example if I have a trip
that I don't need to bring down I want
to get at home and vice versa but if we
are if we are traveling together we're
gonna have someone from the family just
stay with him so it's me keep it just
close and like worst case scenario if no
one in the family is able to you know
his work or school everything's too busy
you can always get a live-in dog sitter
you know someone that you paid to come
and live in your house for a week and
you know take care of your dog and
they're gonna walk and feed him and do
the whole the whole routine evie
underscore Cala asked have you taken
this dog as a training for a future baby
I love you guys
we all love yous we love you I guess
kind of yeah it's definitely a good it's
like a halfway step yeah right it's
obviously not as much responsibility as
a baby you still have to feed it you
have to take it to the bathroom you have
to teach it how to socialize and grow up
and you know it's a lot of similar
stepping stones
what is your for sure yeah definitely
easier but it's a good halfway point
right but I think we're definitely but
it's a really good way too because if
she wants something one way and I want
something the other way it's really good
practice for learning how to bridge that
gap yeah sort of molding together and
working together as a team you know
because wait obviously you're gonna
disagree on certain things you know I
want it this way and she wants it that
way and we can't do it both ways so we
have to figure out how to sort of
coexist together and that's a really
good practice for having a kid I think
definitely so that is gonna be it for
the Q&amp;amp;A I hope we answered a lot of your
eise's questions of what you guys
curious about also if you want to check
out more of her lives you can subscribe

boy yeah he's been having so much fun

first week and he like slept through the
whole night yeah he's eating like just
