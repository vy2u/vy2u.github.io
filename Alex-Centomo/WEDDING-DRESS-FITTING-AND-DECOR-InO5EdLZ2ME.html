surprise for everyone at the wedding
remember signature cocktails have a
walk-in open bar we're gonna organize
also like fun activities to do in like
we are taking our pictures but yeah yeah
it's like that time right before it this
is what I thinking now we're doing decor
this is just like a rough throw together
she's been doing with us but absolutely
beautiful it's gorgeous
oh my god it's so nice you've been
non-stop taking pictures at boomerang
it's so nice our setup don't worry of
having the main table since for so many
people like a tea yeah they offered that
which is really nice I really like these
boxes the live offices and down really
like snow there's like a place to sit
it can be nice to have also behind you
like the would picture a backdrop like
that yeah that's really pretty
hey guys I'm gonna quickly film here
before I go back out into the Sun but
basically we have I know it's so easy so
we have the centerpieces the cutlery the
meals the decorations kind of like
what's going on top of us when we're
sitting there we're gonna have a mix of
like round tables and rectangle tables
that are wood so it kind of switches it
up when you to higher and we still have
like I don't know maybe 10% like
fine-tune what we picked exactly yeah
but we have like a lot of our ideas put
down on paper and she's gonna kind of
work her stuff yeah they they she knows
she knows what we're looking for now
specifically so she's gonna kind of work
through that yeah so it's really
exciting we have the flowers done all
the food the menus done all so yeah oh
my gosh I'm so excited we have to
organize the hotels when you talk to
them like ASAP hotels DJs wedding cake
security dirty shuttles okay guys day
two we are heading well not we well we
meaning we Dan obviously is not coming
and getting fitted for my wedding dress
today I was under the impression that
I'm just getting fitted for it I don't
know she actually like his it's my best
one of my best friend she's making the
dress I don't think she's made it yet
but I don't think I would even show it
before the wedding because I want to be
surprised but yeah holy cat I'm gonna
like film the process of like what I do
when I get fitted and she'll talk a
little bit about you know her thoughts
and like making a dress and all that
kind of stuff why I'm doing it and we
might do like a little Q&amp;amp;A stupid trend
like trashed the dress oh my god is not
like the next day after the wedding you
ruined your wedding what what why would
you do that she did it so she like went
into the lake but why what's the point
he's found although if you don't want to
keep the dressing or don't eat the dress
or something why wouldn't you want to
keep the dress like I want to keep mine
I want to look at it afterwards or
something I really don't get that at all
I was so turned off by it so Emma
actually she's not just like making a
dress like because you just never made a
dress before and I just like asked her
to make me a dress like she actually
went to school for this so she knows how
to do this it's like professional real
yeah so I'm actually the first time in
my life getting measured I've never been
measured before I know I just wear bra
laughs I just saw like these things in
that room over there were you like make
all your clothes and stuff oh my god I'm
scared
are you scared I don't know no like I'm
scared that I'm not gonna fit into my
wedding dress in like eight months
it's being custom made to your body yeah
so you can't okay I just can't I just
can't gain weight okay okay so I'm good
I have to be naked probably okay so
we're gonna like cut the clip so I can
get naked and it'll be doctor okay I'm
gonna do this cuz it's like better than
cat filming me like naked oh I don't
wanna throw myself in the but she just
measured like basically my boobs my
waist my hips and my thighs and then she
made also a sample it's just yeah this
is this is not the dress it's not what
it looks like it's just to see how like
again because of the fabric that you
chose yeah so can lace I don't want to
manipulate that right want to do as many
alterations as you can on something else
and then just do like minor cuts on to
the other one right perfect because my
dress is like mainly lace like the whole
thing is basically lace yeah that's it
so oh my god this is crazy okay yeah
okay yes you got it
that's first time seeing the lace for my
dress
so I wrapped it in acetone free tissue
paper so that the lease doesn't get
discolored it's gonna be over that yeah
well that's the inside lining and then
there's the white yeah oh that's over
the whole a it's over this that's
beautiful right remember we're gonna
shine 'part out yeah yeah and I think
the guys are doing like a gray suit too
then like kind of goes with the muted
pink oh yeah because we're gonna be in
the pink yeah and I think I think
they're gonna also have what's a cold oh
that's the oh my god what suspenders
suspenders I think those are so nice
we're doing a very like vibe of like the
20s and 30s and like that kind of suit
by the video is not over yet we are last
minute going back to the place where we
got my bridesmaids dresses because we
were missing one dress and the company
that makes the dresses actually
unfortunately went out of business so we
need a dress for my sister and since she
is the maid of honor she's going to have
something a little bit different same
color scheme but a little different so
we were going back to the bridal place
so she can pick out a dress we'll see if
they have anything and if not then we
really got to figure it out because that
was an unfortunate circumstance but kind
of running late right now yeah but I
think if you're in the same material
right and then we're really yeah I think
yeah that's what I'm thinking so so
we're at the place now for the
bridesmaids dresses where we came last
time and Kyla is trying on dresses and
different styles and we're gonna figure
out a color that kind of goes similar
with the dress that we had so this is
the color of the bridesmaids dress it's
not the style but this is like this
mauve we like muted pink dusty pink kind
of thing so right now she's trying on a
dress
that is like backless and really
beautiful it's in a different color but
we can do something like you know this
where it's like really similar just the
color is a little different bit more
purpley but it's still really close to
when we have it because she's the maid
of honor it's like you know it's gonna
look really nice she'll stand out in a
really beautiful way oh it's so pretty
I'm in a bra no boobs look good they're
very oh it's padded oh my gosh the back
oh that's so nice and we can do it in
that color yes yes oh my gosh Carl
that's beautiful yeah just a tad darker
that's really nice yeah oh that's
beautiful KY it's so beautiful I think
so one thing is I wish this was a little
bit more open will in her size right
because this is a big size oh so it's
gonna so this is like a 10 so the cuffs
are gonna be smaller okay so yeah you
don't probably be open
I love the twisted back and how it's a
little bit open on the side yes
sexy minutes yeah and because but it
would be you'd see more of her like
because the cuffs would be proportional
and right and if ever you wanted we can
just lower it yeah
cuz my dress is like my friend is making
it for me yeah and it's like very open
back okay so that's why yeah so I think
would be really nice if you had this in
yellow you would look like Belle with
your brown hair
my brown hair well if you had your brown
hair I'm saying and you had that dress
in yellow it would look like Belle
that's cute but I think I like the other
one better it's so much you have to like
you look beautiful Kai oh my gosh I
remember when you're a kid I used to run
like that like a duck okay guys we're
back home so we found Kyla's dress
everything's settled we're gonna do it
in the color that I explained so it's a
little off from the other dresses but
it's gonna be a bit more special and
also the other dresses that we're doing
for the girls it's gonna be a lot more
open back like we're just opening them
up so I can't wait for you guys to see
the finish result it's gonna be so
beautiful but if you guys enjoyed this
