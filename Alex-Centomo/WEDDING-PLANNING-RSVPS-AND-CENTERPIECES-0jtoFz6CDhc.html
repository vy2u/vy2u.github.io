channel again on this camera you guys
all really seem to like it so thank you
so much for all of your support I also
do want to say a huge thank you to guys
for all the nice positive comments on
last week's video if you guys didn't see
it I filmed a video all about how to
take awesome Instagram pictures how to
create a feed all that kind of stuff so
I'll have that linked down below for you
guys and if you're new here make sure to
click that subscribe button and turn on
those post notifications so that you are
always notified when I upload a video if
you want a video all about how to edit
Instagram pictures using Lightroom and
all the kind of stuff give this video a
thumbs up so that I know with that being
said I'm just waiting for Daniel right
now he's in the shower but if you are
also new here Daniel and I are engaged
we are planning your wedding right now
and I have started a series on this
channel kind of talking about our
wedding planning everything it's been a
minute since I've done a video for this
because we did take some time to like
just figure everything out of what we
wanted we found the venue you guys know
that we are so happy and thrilled with
it so the next step was to get all of
our invitations so RSVPs save-the-dates
all that kind of stuff we have our
official date which is October 5th 2018
I am so excited but also kind of nervous
dan and I just got our package in the
mail with all of the invitations so I
figured we would open them on camera to
see our reaction of them because
obviously when you're picking them
online it's like a lot different than
when you get the person who's just
scratching his cone he was recently
neutered so poor baby and then after
that we also have kind of figured out
what we want to do for our centerpieces
so that is gonna be discussed in here as
well and then the last thing is kind of
talking about our vision for the wedding
and what we have planned if you guys
want to see what we have done so far
when it comes to venues bridesmaid
shopping for the bridesmaids dresses my
dress all that kind of stuff I'll have
links down below I started doing this on
my blogging channel but then I figured a
lot of you guys were curious about it on
this one and most of you said yes you
were so I kind of switched over to this
it's a little confused and wise but on
both channels but I mean that's the wool
that's the reason so I'm just gonna wait
for Dallas see how the shower
we'll open up the box I guess mr. off
with wedding invitations but we got what
RSVPs and save-the-dates
hmm so do you want explain of the
differences I saved the day it's just
sort of like hey this is the date we're
doing our wedding make sure you keep
that day open and then an RSVP is more
closer to the actual date and it's like
are you coming yes and if you're someone
who has an option for a plus-one are you
bringing a plus-one
yes or no and what are you guys gonna be
eating so that we can tell the caterers
what meals they're preparing you know so
we actually like I said we ordered ours
online and we got some from a website
called minted this is not sponsored but
what I liked about minted was that you
can actually custom make it online so
when we were looking they have samples
and stuff and be kind of what the look
of one because we are getting married
outdoors and it's kind of in the forest
so we wanted something a bit earthy that
kind of had a more varied not fairytale
but like woodsy vibe but they have they
have you know probably thousands of
different combinations you saw me yeah
and then so then you custom make
everything you can decide what font like
you said the color and then it lays it
all out for you and is like is this
exactly what you like and you say yes
and so so these are the RSVPs so there's
a little bit of plastic blaring but you
guys can see they're all tilted back and
forth so you get a good sort of angle
these are the RSVPs I mean they come
with envelopes as well we just got plain
envelope then this one we're gonna have
to actually like unwrap for them to see
it
yeah it's covered by it or you could
probably just take what's not attached
to the plastics let's attach the plastic
but then we got the save the dates the
save the dates look like bigger yeah
they are this year now yeah so the RSVPs
are like a little smaller there's two
stacks here Wow
so this is the save the date bigger but
it's basically the same same idea same
same sort of style
with like though the woodsy and like the
trees and the leaves I mean no trees be
like the foliage on it so join us for
the wedding of Daniel Jensen and
Sandridge and tomo a fifth of October
2018 at five o'clock in the evening and
then merriment to follow meaning the
serum of the reception yeah so we really
like they had different colors for the
leaves as well but we really like the
green one because it was more on vibe
and then as well as the gold I could
adjust that closer here and it's foil
pressed and then the font is the font
that we chose yeah we did like a few
different fonts as you can see mm-hmm
and then it comes also with envelopes
which are really nicely stacked and
they're just plain so that we could
write the address on top yeah these are
beautiful this place that are really
good shoes yeah seriously so I'll have a
link down below if you guys are curious
to check out the website again it's not
sponsored I just yeah since it went so
well you guys might as well check it out
it really I mean you could probably do
like graduations Barba's and then I
think the other thing we want to talk
about our centerpieces so when we were
thinking for centerpieces we wanted
something kind of basic not too tall so
that you really can't see the person
sitting in front of you cuz I think
we're doing circular tables right yeah
to me circle tables were more fun
because if you do like long rectangular
ones if someone's sitting at this corner
and someone's sitting at this corner
they can't really big talk each other
they can't see each other it happened to
wonder if like a birthday we went to for
a family thing whereas like the whole
family on one rectangle and I only saw
like the four or five people around me
yeah we went like two and a half hours
they even talked to the people over
there so if you're in round tables
everyone can at least talk to each other
yeah I mean to each their own obviously
people like the look of the long tables
as well but we really wanted and like
obviously we're gonna have specific
tables for specific people so yeah I try
to
yeah I try to like match people up with
yeah and the tables aren't huge so no
probably eight to ten per table but yeah
we wanted something that wasn't too high
so that you could still talk to the
person in front of you and make
conversation with but we also wanted
something that goes along with our theme
which is woodsy slash fairytale slash
rustic so for the centerpieces I
actually spoke about it a bit with my
friend Emma she helped me kind of come
up with the idea she's been to a lot of
wedding so she's seen and kind
has like pros and cons and stuff so we
kind of sat down and I figured out some
things that I liked and then I showed ad
and he really liked it as well so I mean
it's not 100 percent final yet you guys
can obviously give us suggestions if you
have any ideas but basically what we are
planning so I drew out a little sketch
but what we are thinking of doing is
slab of wood on the table like this so
this we can actually cut ourself because
we have a lot of blank trees and stuff
around us so I mean will that are
already cut down or you can obviously
just buy wood and then cut them yourself
with a chainsaw so this would be in the
center and then we were thinking of two
mason jars one of them being like this
size and the small one or having this
and a big one
or having this in a small one like we're
not really sure and what I was thinking
of having around it is like some kind of
um it's not lace what I call it oily
though what it is you know there's like
little white doily things yeah like that
so kind of wrapped around in the center
and then having twine wrapped around
here as well or in the center of the
doily kind of tied in a bow and
obviously we would like glue together
and then inside of the mason jars we
would have fairy lights so very winds
are calling very subtle and cute she
also said that some people put sand in
it and then you probably make like twigs
and branches and leaves so we were
thinking of doing that and then as well
as gluing on to this maybe little pine
cones and pine needles stuff like that
so it kind of looked looks very woodsy
and so I'm gonna do since its October do
like like falling leaves them yeah like
you know like the brown leaves and stuff
or even bread but the tables that we
want are actually just like like we said
circular tables we are looking into
getting the chairs kind of made out of
like a wood material and that's like not
wicker but like yeah like not just like
a plastic chair no and then having like
a white kind of cushion and thing on the
back to make it very rustic rustic but
also comfortable because you can go full
rustic and do like barn stools and like
benches but yeah then it's you know it's
like hours and hours and hours at night
eing so kind of uncomfortable so you
want we don't
try to blend comfort the look that we're
going and then as for food so the place
that we're getting married actually has
their own catering company so we're
going with them they can basically do
everything like anything we can even
come up with ideas off menu yeah
obviously they're chefs can can ya
manage it and she even showed us like
examples of what they just do so we were
thinking of having three options so you
have your beef meat so it's like any
kind of beef they would want well no I
kind of worked in Reverse
obviously we're gonna have vegetarian
options because there's a lot of people
there that are gonna be either
vegetarian or vegan so that's like a
guaranteed and then normally at a
wedding or a big like ceremony like this
you have some sort of like a meat and
then a fish you know because then it's
like well maybe some people don't want
to be vegetarian but they don't want to
have a meat thinks it's kind of heavy so
then you have that in-between sort of
light fish dish so yeah we're doing like
a vegetarian a fish and then of these
you have like sort of three options some
people would do like a chicken and a
fish I mean you could do like a pork and
a fish but I just thought I don't know
what sort of like covers like a pretty
broad range that way you know you have
like a beef fish and then a vegetarian
covers everything and I think also on
the invitations we're gonna mark a
little place saying like if you're
gluten-free or if you're vegan if you
have any allergies accomodated yeah
which is really good because I thought
that was just simple like the place that
were getting married already kind of
covers all of that and even said that
they can do anything we are doing open
bar for the full night so that is until
2 p.m. I believe they'll or 1 p.m. they
closed the bar 1 p.m. and 1 a.m. or 2
a.m. I don't remember and then you can
dance until 3:00 and then the venue
closes yeah any closer um open bar for
me was like the number one not most
important thing obviously the wedding
itself people or the bone it comes to
like this is the ceremony mm-hmm I'm not
ceremony if the reception and all the
guests like oh maybe you didn't quite
like the food choice we had but I know
from experience I've been to a few
weddings and I know a lot people I've
been to a lot of weddings one of the
biggest things that people don't like is
having to bring cash at a bar yeah like
bring their money to the bar and like
buy drinks change tips like having to
deal with that whole thing it's just so
much easier to have an open bar because
then people if they want to drink they
can drink if they don't want to drink
they don't have to drink and there's no
hassle with tipping I mean a lot of
people leave tips anyways but
there's no hassle with like bringing
your wallet and like bringing all your
money and worrying about it and it's
just so much simpler if we both really
liked that they give us the option if we
want to do open bar I know you said 100%
yes even though we don't really drink
alcohol there it's for like all the
people that come that do drink yeah and
then also one thing that I thought was
really cool is when they said so
basically after the ceremony we get
married and then obviously the wedding
parties are gonna go take pictures bride
and groom we're gonna take pictures so
everyone else kind of makes their way to
the reception area which looks like a
like an old barn kind of thing yes like
a renovated bar and kind of thing yeah
and so there is a section where you walk
in where you get this signature drink Oh
on arrival you get and it can be
anything that like we like to drink
obviously we don't really drink alcohol
but we can still kind of create
something like either the girl drinks
will be like sangria or the guy drinks
will be like a whiskey or you know
something you can do whatever you can
cocktail you could do much you could do
honestly whatever but I thought that was
really cool so people like kind of they
slowly go in they get a drink they
mingle and then there's little
appetizers hors d'oeuvres
finger foods and then we go do our
pictures and when we go back if you guys
have any suggestions obviously feel free
to leave them down below in the comments
we're always welcoming to those in the
end we're gonna do what we like but I
mean your help can mean a lot to us
especially if you have been to a lot of
weddings or if you are married yourself
or you are going through the process and
there are things that you kind of come
across that you think would be helpful
kind of wetting yourself and you
something happened that day or night
that you never like foresaw mm-hmm but
it's kind of like oh this is definitely
gonna happen watch out for that you know
like I don't know some people say you
get really caught up talking to too many
people because everyone wants to talk to
you you know I'm like prepare for that I
don't know something like that if you
have a little advice but obviously we're
very excited we have been putting
everything kind of on the back burner
for a while because we have so much
stuff happen and I mean it's good our
venue is able to organize yeah that's
that's partially why we haven't been
working
much is because it's just a phone call
to the venue and we go through like 90%
of everything we need to do done in like
that afternoon and then that's it yeah
so we might bring you guys along for
that when we do decide to go is probably
next month I think would make the most
sense or at the end of this month yeah
probably the end of this month before
trips Lisa and yeah I hope you guys
