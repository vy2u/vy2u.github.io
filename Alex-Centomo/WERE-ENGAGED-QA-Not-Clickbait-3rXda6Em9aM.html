channel I am here with Daniel if you
guys don't know who he is well I'm sure
most of you guys know who he is baby
knows he's been in a bunch of my videos
but all wearing her John's maybe there's
some some new subscribers they don't
yeah well anyways he's my fiance so
weird to say like I'm so used to calling
him my boyfriend and yesterday was the
first time I said you were my fiance
could you say it to was I with Kat
yesterday no the day before and I was
downtown and I refer to as my fiancee
and she was like whoa yeah so um I asked
you guys on Twitter oh ho I'm clapping
quick as you guys on Twitter and on
Instagram story to leave some questions
in my comments or tweet me questions
asking me any kind of engagement
question questions just because a lot of
people are curious and we do have a
daily vlogging channel with like the two
of us and we have spoken about it many
times on that channel but never on this
channel and still to this day people
don't know that I'm engaged like I will
talk about it on any kind of social
media platform and people just don't we
go yeah so I figured that I would just
make it official on this channel and let
you guys know that yes we are engaged
it's not clickbait this is real um we
have been engaged now for three weeks
yeah so it's been since November October
24th so yeah three weeks ago on
Instagram first cuz there's so many
questions there
okay so Kel burns asked what kind of
wedding bands do you think you'll each
get PS I bet anything will Gorge with
your engagement ring Congrats thank you
so much
so with look if you guys don't know I
have like a roof
if you guys don't know I have like a
really small engagement ring because
that's just what I love with jewelry and
it's crazy because ever since I post
about it or showed people I get so many
judgments on it and I kind of want to
clarify something like I don't think
it's necessary that the size of the
diamond or the ring or whatever it is
that you want depicts how much the
person loves you like I think that's
ridiculous and I had people I know in my
life tell me like oh if the ring is at
$20,000 and is he worth it it's like
once again I know people are joking but
the same time kind of serious and I
don't think that's important I love
dainty jewelry that's just what I love
we had gone wedding shop nobody shopping
ring shop yeah we've gone and looked
around to see like what she liked so
that I'd have an idea of like styles
yeah and then she sent me a few that she
was like these ones I really really love
so then I had a really good idea of like
what to get and then I knew this one was
like her favorite or like one of her
favorite so I got that one because I
knew she would like it yeah cuz everyone
they look at it to go oh that's it and I
always get so confused so I have
pictures of it you're not Mabel Sikhs I
can't refocus but it's basically a small
tiny gold band with three small diamonds
on it and that's just what I love so
much it's exactly what I like thank you
exactly what you like it's like your
necklace
yeah it's whatever it's for both of us
so stop judging but anyways for our
wedding bands I don't know what I want
to guess anything that matches is like
small skinny one but I know you have
something in mind I want more of like a
bigger one because I wear rings like
sometimes and I like sometimes usually
almost all the time the only time I take
them off as what I work out or like
sometimes when I shower um I like
thicker band so like this one is really
thick I don't know if you can see it's
pretty big and will probably sit on your
head better yeah my brother-in-law has
one that's big like that and it's like
it's kind of like a gunmetal like kind
of like my watch color and then the
inside is like silver it's really nice
so I want something like I want
something man
I don't want something like just a plain
gold band yeah like I'd want something a
little bit more like masculine Esther
underscore no wait
novikova who asked where are you
planning to go for honeymoons and when
will you guys have the wedding so for
our honeymoons we actually don't know
this because we travel so much anyways
like either for pleasure or work so
we've been to so many places and there
are still so many places we'd love to
visit before our honeymoon I don't like
honeymoon I don't know if we'd want to
go somewhere new to like explore it
together or if you want to go somewhere
relaxing and just like be peaceful
together it's hard to know because like
I remember when we went to Santorini
we're like oh my god this is gorgeous
it's so peaceful like maybe we would
come back here because we could just
relax but like would we want to go
somewhere new
and I feel like so many people do like
Bora Bora for there anymore now that
it's bad it just that like even people
in my personal life like they it's like
the extreme place and as much as I would
love to go there I feel like for me
honeymooners no but for who we are as
people we wouldn't like love that I
think for us we'd like something like
Alaska yeah like something just like in
the wilderness and that's just what we
love so maybe that and I think we're
we're gonna try to plan to get married
in the summer yeah if all things can go
well summer summer go cuz it's too hot
like early summer this one comes from
Alize hoob camera I'm sorry if I
mispronounced that she said how do you
want your wedding to look like so both
of us are not really picky when it comes
to wedding decor and stuff like that and
I know for me like I want to keep it
really casual and like fun and like just
really lively and like happy and we both
just really want it to be outdoors like
either in a forest or like near forest
or like it feel like something really
peaceful and outdoorsy rustic yeah like
rustic like could be like a barn or like
near a barn but not like without like
not apartment no no obviously
an abandoned barn with yeah forests and
stuff around that you can you anyways we
have all these ideas obviously it's just
brainstorming time like we've been
engaged for only a few weeks now so
everyone keeps asking me all these
questions and I'm not the kind of person
have had my wedding plan since I was
five like I just didn't ever really not
care but like think about it I just
thought I I don't know I guess I just
never thought I would ever thought any
boy would like me do whoa
every underscore Calla asked are you and
down together from the first moment or
there was a period of time that you were
separated I love you guys so much I wish
you to live a life full of happiness
together that's so sweet
so we met actually when we were kids
so during probably the first ten years
of us knowing each other we were not
together if we didn't like each other
more than ten years I many when I was
eight and we started dating when I was
twenty-one yeah but there's this was all
to say there was a period of time where
we weren't like even remember you can
saw each other that's true from like 17
to 21 we saw each other maybe like twice
really I don't even go partying it well
like because we were both like birds I
got very I guess but like from 8 to 17
we swam together so we were together
like all the time yeah not just the two
of us like our group yeah and then 17 to
21 we saw each other like I said a
couple of times at parties or whatever
and then at 21 we started dating and
then we were separated for about a month
at pretty much this time last year we
just sort of took a little break to
figure ourselves out it was like six
weeks something like that just to sort
of figure ourselves out and like that
got us up and then towards Christmas
time New Year's we were back together
floor new floor new FL o r EG n IE r
asks what is the whip what is the thing
you're most excited to do as a married
couple do you have plans for the near
future example travel or program
projects
um I think for us like we're excited to
get married because it's just like that
extra step in our relationship and I'm
really excited for that part of our live
live lies light life I don't know our
lines together and I think that we
definitely really want to have kids like
that's something that we're really
excited for not like as soon as we get
married like loli the next day well I
think we're going to try to do is like
be married for a bit and then eventually
like let it happen naturally because I
feel like the more that people try to
have children in my experience I see
that they get so stressed over it and
then just doesn't end up happening
because they're way too stressed so I
think for us we're just going to try let
it happen naturally that happens it
happens if not it doesn't but we really
do want kids so I think that that's
probably I think for me that's like what
I'm most excited about - yeah hey you me
you pick one oh yeah I keep choosing
that when I was forgot what you're gonna
do okay this one's pretty good it's a
little more serious it's from Lou
underscore Mallya and she says how did
you know you were ready to get engaged
was there like a specific time and how
long do you think god that's oh yeah it
says and how long do you think you
should wait to get engaged
um I that's hard to say I definitely
think you should be like moving towards
your adult life before going to engage
that's my personal opinion like if
you're both in high school and like just
sort of dating and you're not like you
don't have really a career path you're
setting yourself on yet we're like
you're not you know moving out and like
being independent I personally don't
think you're ready to get engaged yet
but if you feel differently then you
you'll definitely feel you know feel
what you feel inside but for us I just
knew that we were ready because like
we've been together for so long we have
such a deep connection we moved out
together like we're like I said we're
taking our steps towards our adult life
and it just I'm like I knew it was the
right time and I just sort of woke up
one day and I was like you know
I'm like I'm doing this I'm going to do
this in the next few days because I just
really want to do this and like I really
want to be engaged and then get married
eventually I think for me we have been
talking about it for like two years and
since Greece that we were talking about
it and it was always one of those things
that oh if it happens like I always kind
of told him what I liked when it came to
proposals just because I'm a very like
anxious person and is oh I talked to you
guys this is still a camera like I feel
like I'm talking to you but you're my
friends whereas like if I'd to get up in
a crowd in front of strangers I don't
know if I'd be able to do it our like if
you were to propose to me in public and
everyone was staring I would actually
like but it's not even just strangers
like when we had our engagement party
and her dad did a toast to us she was
like really she didn't want to go like
in front of her family she want to cut
the cake in front of people she was like
I don't like opening presents in front
of no I find it weird she's very very
private so that's why we decided to do
it like just the two of us and I waited
until it was just us private because I
do YouTube but I'm knowing you're here
I'm shy yes I'm embarrassed so and as a
kid I hated my birthday hey when people
used to sing happy birthday to me with
the candles I would get so awkward in
all the home videos I would like hide my
face or like yell at people like I was
just such an awkward person so I always
told him if you're going to propose
please please the one thing I ask is
just don't do like a big thing in public
in front of a ton of people just like
something simple that's all I care about
and obviously that took a lot of
pressure off of him because I feel like
a lot of times guys but like I was
really nervous when we used to talk
about it I was really worried that like
that wasn't what she wanted she was just
trying to make me feel better no and so
then in my head I'm like okay well I'll
do it that way but then still in the
back of my mind probably because like
society says it has to be this big thing
doesn't have to I know but like that's
the way we're like conditioned that
thinks when the back of my mind I was
like really nervous that if I did that
she'd be like oh wow he didn't even put
effort in even though she told me like
so many times that she didn't care I
still always in the back of my mind
effort I wanted it to be special and I
realized one of the things are
like right before like the last month
let's say when I knew I was going to do
it I realized that it is special even if
it's not a big thing like just because
like just the two of us doing it
together like not privately but like
privately was very special and it made
it really special we didn't film it
we didn't post the proposal on social
media we didn't want like it was just
for us and I think that's really
important but what I want to say too is
that you know one of the first things
that people always ask is oh my god let
me see the ring and how did he do it
exactly that's what I mean like society
everyone like thinks those are the big
things that matter but Mike's crazy
because I guess it's the media or
whatever but people they like judge the
way it is and I just don't understand
because shouldn't it be about what makes
the people happy so lil on twitter at
lil Zeeman 99 asks what was your
family's reaction to the engagement so
dad actually spoke to my parents
beforehand like the week before asking
their permission then he spoke to his
parents as well just letting them know
he was going to propose and they're
obviously very thrilled but I want you
to explain me not like it's super detail
but like what it was like who spoke to
my dad this is my mom and universe is
your parents um so I asked her dad to
talk to him and so we went for like
lunch / coffee or whatever and I told
him and then he was like super super
happy and he looked like he was like
getting teary eyed like really emotional
cuz I know it's special like it's his
first daughter you know so I think it
was very it was very emotional for him
but he was so happy and he said of
course and then I said like I haven't
told anyone you know and I want to tell
a few people before I do it so I think
like I wanted to tell her mom and he's
like I think that would be really nice
so then we went to her office and I told
her and she was really happy in town
when I called her though I said hey viv
like can I come see you and talk to you
for 10 minutes she's like yeah sure then
she said for like the next 15 minutes
when I was driving to her office she was
like so nervous she thought something
went wrong she's like oh no what did how
its do like did they break up they dig
in a fight like she was like so nervous
that you like did something and I was
like
and then I got there and I said it and
she was like oh my God thank you so much
like I'm so relieved and so happy and
then I told my parents that I was going
to do it and like for my parents my
older sister has already been married so
for them it's like they got that first
one out of the way so they're like more
absolutely there no but like you know
the stress of like at first your
firstborn child so they were just like
really excited and really happy there
was no like like oh my god it's like
they were just really not nervous here
just really happy my mom was really
happy um my sister was really really
happy too and so are his siblings so
this is from Serena and her username is
at wanderlust reads oh I like that
she asked both of us Dan how involved
were you be in the planning process will
you actively participate or just let
Alex glendol I don't know like what the
custom is for that I feel like a lot of
people it's supposed to be like the
bride or like a bridal party's job to do
all the planning but like I don't I
don't think oh it should because like I
want to have it yeah but that's what I
mean is that like the wedding is always
such a big deal for the wife that it
like has to be perfect that's often like
the man doesn't really get involved in
it I don't know that's our thing is that
we both don't care about a lot of things
so we're just kind of like but I want to
help as much as I can like I don't think
it should be her job or her maid of
honors job or like the mom's jobs or
like I think it should just be like a
joint effort I'm like it should be
everyone's job yeah exactly it's just
it's funny but yours I don't want a
planet it's too stressful
I don't care people are like well what
flowers you gonna have I don't care you
don't care I need to match the
bridesmaids dresses and like I don't
care what color they are they're like
what can we have just any kind of dress
I'm like I guess then they're getting so
mad at me I'm like Oh care I don't care
about anything anyways I hope this
answered enough questions if you have
any other questions that we didn't talk
about feel free to leave them down below
