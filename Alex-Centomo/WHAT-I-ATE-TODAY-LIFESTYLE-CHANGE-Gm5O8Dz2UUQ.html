channel I high that's boo there's not
the cutest thing so if you guys didn't
know I do have a blogging channel which
I blog all stalee with my fiance I'll
have that link down below if you guys
want to go subscribe to it because I do
talk a lot on that channel about things
that are going on in my life but
basically the past few months have been
kind of hard for me for a lot of
different personal reasons and I've been
talking about it a little bit on my
second channel about getting healthy
working out eating everything like that
just bear with me guys this is kind of
gonna be a long intro I know a lot of
you guys probably don't really care I
just want to get into what I'm eating
for the day but there is a reason as to
why I'm eating the way I'm eating and I
think it's very important for a lot of
you guys to listen to this
so please just don't skip ahead because
this is important so I have been very
very down lately when it comes to my
mental state you guys know I well I
don't know if you know this who knew or
not but I have BPD which is borderline
personality disorder and there's a lot
of stigma that goes along with that
disorder it's hard to diagnose because
the symptoms are so generic
but people BPD sometimes get a bad rep
because of what's written online so if
you're gonna read stuff online like just
keep in mind that there's a spectrum and
not everyone's exactly the same and
there's a lot of things that go with it
but basically my mental state has been
kind of iffy the past few months and I
don't know if it's come across on camera
at all yeah I haven't really spoke about
it much on my channel and there's a
reason why I'm talking about it now
because it has to do a lot with my diet
and ever since I became a vegetarian I
have been feeling really down and tired
and I know a lot of you guys are gonna
say well you're just not eating the
proper amount and blah blah blah and
you're right I am totally not eating the
right things I was taking my
multivitamins of a very picky eater and
and I get sick of tastes very quickly so
I can't eat a lot of like one
I need you to tap us and it's totally my
fault I could meal prep I could do
whatever but when you're traveling a lot
and you're in places that don't have
very many options I've just been feeling
so down so I went to the doctors and he
told me that being a vegetarian being a
vegan is completely fine as long as
you're getting everything you need in
your body so I got a blood test
everything like that and I haven't
gotten the test results yet but he did
tell me based on what's going on in my
life the fact that I'm getting bruises
all over my body I am NOT sleeping and
then during the day I'm exhausted I
headaches all the time he told me to try
eating a bit of fish and seeing if that
helps but he's gonna definitely make
sure that I'm not lacking in anything so
I just want to be completely transparent
with you guys I have this week started
eating a little bit of fish and I've
been feeling really guilty about it as
soon as I started eating fish
I started feeling amazing like so good
and this plays a role in BPD because
when you deal with a lot of mental
struggles you want to make sure that
your whole body is healthy and every
other aspect and I wasn't being 100%
healthy so I'm doing this month I have a
goal for myself because my whole family
he's basically doing this it is a type
of diet so I want to make sure that I'm
letting you guys know that I'm not
telling you to live this way I'm not
telling you to do this diet I'm not a
nutritionist I'm not a dietician this is
just something we're trying cuz I want
to get back on track I have gained like
15 pounds since October and I know it
doesn't really show like you guys might
not see it but like I see it like I see
it in my arms my face and it's because I
was eating like crap because I didn't
know what to eat I didn't know what to
do properly so I've decided to do this
month of no sugar and no carbs carbs
meaning like complex carbs like no bread
no pasta but I'm also doing no rice and
no potatoes and I know that seems a
little harsh but I am eating fish I'm
eating a lot of vegetables
I'm not eating really that many that
much fruit and there's a reason to it I
don't want to get too into it it's
something that my family is doing but I
just I I'm nervous to talk about it
online because I don't mean you guys to
get the wrong idea I don't want you guys
to think that like this is the way to
live I don't know what your body types
are I don't know if it's healthy for you
this is just what I'm doing and I
mentioned in my vlog channel and so many
of you guys want to see a video about
this so I'm doing it here but please
take everything with a
results because I don't want to give
anyone the wrong information I'm still
learning myself and all I know is that
to get my body back into shape because
my doctor did say my BMI was a little
high I'm gonna be doing this for the
whole month allowing myself one cheat
day a week so if you guys are curious to
see what I've been eating keep watching
this is very long but I think it's very
important and I just want to be
completely authentic with you guys and
know what's going on in my life and I
you guys are totally entitled to your
opinion that feel free to comment
anything you want down below it honestly
I'm not gonna take anything to heart
because I'm at a place right now in my
life where I need to make a change and
it's been really really hard for me so I
hope you guys can understand I love you
so much and I hope you want to stick by
me and subscribe and turn your
notifications on and give it a thumbs up
and I will see you guys in a second
we're showing you my meal for the day
okay guys breakfast this morning I made
some egg whites with spinach onion and
green pepper and the knocker red pepper
and then on top I put a bit of salt and
pepper and then cayenne pepper and as
well as chili powder it looks really
good I had a really intense workout at
the gym this morning so I'm excited to
fill up on this amazing a breakfast and
I'm also gonna finish drinking my water
this bottle it like fills so much I
don't even know like how to explain this
but basically my normal gym bottle I can
drink it like twice and this when I
bring this to the gym I only able to
drink halfway and so I'm gonna finish
that with my breakfast
then have a few veggies just because I
really feel like having some broccoli
and I just bought this at the grocery
store and these are typically my
favorite vegetables other than peppers I
love peppers but I just had a ton of
those in my omelet so I'm gonna have
some more veggies and finish up my water
Dan's eating his breakfast right now and
then I'll show you guys my lunch okay so
I'm having at some and that's right now
I'm just heading to the doctor's real
quick I have an appointment to do and
this is a really good source of protein
right down I think so nuts yeah they're
really good unsalted it says on the box
they're gluten free but I don't know
nuts like gluten at all
maybe you feel like coated with
something but it was unsalted like
normal Organic nuts I don't know if that
means either a little baggie like this
water last a while before my next meal
about this really good kale salad that
has cranberries are these lima beans or
like peas or something just basically a
bun there's some Brussels sprouts in it
there's a bunch of veggies and also some
those look like sunflower seeds with our
type of seeds and also this bean salad
which has pepper I don't know what else
is in it but it's really friggin good
it's dinnertime and I'm currently making
myself some butternut squash noodles so
if you guys have any butternut squash
you can use a spiral spiralizer i think
it's called or you can buy them
prepackaged like this and then i just
drizzled a little bit of extra-virgin
olive oil on top with some salt and
pepper and then I'm going to lay them
out on a baking sheet with parchment
paper and put them in the oven at 400
degrees Fahrenheit for around 7 to 10
minutes and then it put like a sauce on
it kind of thing and I I don't even know
what yet and then I'm going to be making
a bean salad with kidney beans and chick
peas and onions I'm like a homemade kind
of dressing I don't even know what I'm
gonna put in it but like definitely kind
of like a vinaigrette type thing and
