channel I am here with a haul today I
feel like this is the last week and I
can probably do a winter haul before all
the spring hauls start up if you guys
are new here you might not know this but
I actually am in Canada it's still
middle of winter snow everywhere - 25
degrees Celsius it's great oh I'm trying
to film here can't you see the camera

I don't know so make sure you select on
your sub feed all videos so that you
guys also never miss a video and without
further ado let's just get into this
haul I am a very excited for spring to
be here but I live in freezing cold
weather as I said and so I still have to
shop for this type of weather but I
still do want to be kind of cute you
know my struggle quickly want to talk
about my necklaces a jewelry and have my
own jewelry line with stillness
it's called lumen kala if you guys are
curious to shop my jewelry I'll have a
link down below for you guys to check
out and that would be awesome and if you
do buy anything take some pictures and
tag me on instagram or on the makaula
because I like to repost and it's really
fun it's really cool to see my designs
on you guys like honestly it's like it's
amazing and we are working on more
things so it's not just gonna be
necklaces hint hint
booth cheering my pets that's cool the
first thing I don't know what I just did
I figured I would talk about what I'm
wearing right now this sweater so I'm
brandy it's a basic crew neck knit
sweater jumper another term it's red it
looks kind of vintage II and I really
like this color and I feel like red is
so in this season like I see everyone
wearing red
to be honest like I never would have
purchased this color but I saw a picture
on Instagram and I don't think I'll be
able to find it but I saw a picture of a
girl she was in red and it just looked
so aesthetically pleasing and I was like
wow that is so beautiful and so now I'm
inspired and I keep buying
reddish-orange II things and I think is
really nice the holistic my teeth great
probably did also from Brandi booting it
off of it I got this waffle tee
long-sleeve thing with three buttons I
really like these types of tops in
particular because for one they're
really soft and comfortable but two
they're awesome for layering they're
really great just to kind of lounge
around in if you want to spruce up your
outfit this with high-waisted blue jeans
but more ripped up jeans with some
really nice either Doc Martens or
booties with a bit of a heel and a big
chunky jacket or cardigan over that is
so nice
this just adds a basic part to an outfit
and then you can kind of spruce up the
rest of it and it's great for layering
boo another thing from brandy into this
type of sweater this color reminds me of
my primary school so we had a uniform
aka just colors and it was navy blue
white and this kind of green and so
every time I would see the screen I was
like no but now I don't know I you guys
know I like love these types of sweaters
I think they're so cute with the little
1/2 or 3/4 of zip thing and I have this
in a periwinkle color I have the Newport
one and I saw the green and I was like
you know what I really like the sports
green lately for some reason even though
it reminds me of school when I was a kid
but I tried it on and I loved it and
it's super soft
and I don't know I just I really like
that color lately so I'm just
experimenting let's move on to pants I
got these really cute track pants from
Free People
they look like the adidas ones a little
bit more fitted and they're high-waisted
they have this really pretty colored
drawstring and I thought this would be
perfect to travel in because it's thin
sometimes I like when I get anxious I
get really like hot and I sweat and I
feel like if I'm in stuff that's very
constricting like leggings I used to
like to travel in leggings but I would
feel so like constricted that these are
still cute but really flowy really light
and super soft so I feel like I'd be
comfortable wearing this and then I got
a pair of Tommy sweatpants again these
are just too like chilling I mean what
else would they be for I got them at
urban and I like that it looks like
there's underwear sticking out I don't
know it kind of looks like a dude like
you know I reminds me of you like the
90s or me know early 2000s when like
guys used to have their underwear
sticking out of their pens everything
I'm buying is like oh it reminds me of
something or it Minds me or something
I got a pair of jeans from urban and
these are really cool because it reminds
me of like 90s style mixed with current
I don't know if that makes sense okay
but basically they're jeans that are
high waisted and they have one rip in
the knee here they're not skinny they're
more like I mean there's skinny on the
waist but then they're kind of like mom
jeans but I would not roll them or maybe
I would I don't even know yet but
basically why I like them is because the
zipper goes all the way around the
crotch up until the butt and also you
see how the top of the jeans are just
like frayed and they don't have like a
typical Jean rings for a belt or
whatever when I was a kid there are a
lot of people on TV that used to wear
jeans that did not have like proper
denim top and I used to always think as
a kid I want jeans like that now that I
saw that I was like all that reminds me
oh my god this haul is so weird I'm just
in like in a really good mood right now
because I'm about to go bridesmaids
shopping aka my maid of honor my sister
we're going to get her dress in like an
hour and I'm really excited and I'm
trying to contain my excitement but I
feel like me trying to be calm
containing excitement looks weird
because I'm like anyways
I got a hat it looks like this from lack
of color you know when you want to go on
a train you don't want to just like sit
on it you want to conduct it it's what
you wear kidding I actually really like
these types of hats and I would wear
this to a festival okay my car just like
was full so it's a delete stuff then I
got some stuff from princess Polly over
here and I want to talk about what is
that thing on my screen it was like a
weird thing anyways I got pair of denim
jeans that were just like basic
high-waisted mom jeans that were black
and in the back there was a little rip
under the butt which is really cool but
I decided to rip up the knees as well
and make them like really big rips
because can you guess it reminded my
best friend Kat came over the other day
and we were watching Flashdance which
fun fact I was named after Alex from
Flashdance because it was the first time
my mom ever saw a guy's name on a girl
and she thought it was super cool and so
she also knew no Alex's back then now
obviously every frickin person's name
Alex yeah we I told her you have to
watch flash Jen's like have you not seen
Flashdance it's one of my favorite 80s
films I love it so much I mean obviously
I my name was inspired by the film so
let's watch it and so we're sitting
there watching it and there's this one
scene where Alex is sitting against the
wall and she's like smoking a cigarette
which I know it's so bad for you but
like it was just such a cool scene like
the lighting everything that the
director did was just amazing and she
was wearing this like white tank that
was off her shoulder and she's chilling
with her knees up and she's wearing
these blue denim jeans with huge rips in
the knees and then she got up and she
was like walking against her I think it
was like her pole or something where she
dances and in the back there's a rip
under the butt and I was like oh my god
I have jeans with a grip under the butt
I'm gonna rip up the knees because I
love that look it was so cool yeah
that's how I did that and I really liked
it so I'm actually going somewhere next
week and I want to bring these bad boys
I'm gonna take a bunch of pictures in
them and I want to try to recreate that
look in my own style then this thing
over here this is a dress it's flowing I
like that it's white with black polka
dots and it's pretty deep V over here so
I'm probably gonna wear it with a
bralette but I have an event when I am
going somewhere and I figured I could
wear this with like Doc Martin booties
or something like chunky combat boots
and a really cute dress
kind of edge it up and maybe throw over
a super oversized like faux leather
jacket or a denim jacket or like I don't
know chunky sweater and just having the
skirt poking out I'm not too sure yet
maybe even with this hat would be cute
you know the one I showed you I thought
that was kind of a cool outfit and then
the last thing I got from princess Polly
that's like appropriate for this weather
a black teddy bear jacket this is by the
brand I am Gia and I got a size medium
forget what all the other sizes are to
be honest feel like everyone has this
jacket and some color I have the tan one
but I got the black because I thought it
was so nice over here this is not my
princess Polly but I wanted to show this
crop sweater to give support so my
sister's friends started their own
clothing clothing blind clothing line
called chase and hunter and I don't know
much about the brand
other than that they really want it's
about like chasing your dreams or
something like that I don't really get
the full thing about it but it's really
chill casual super soft sweaters and
they also have like cropped ones the big
ones are unisex I usually buy it in a
size large and I think it's super
oversized super comfortable but this one
especially I love the cropped with the
hoodie because I love to work out in
sweaters but I like when they're cropped
because I can wear high waisted leggings
and it looks really cute but I sweat a
lot because it's I'm wearing a sweater
right which is good when you're working
out and I always get questions about it
so yeah I figured I would just you know
give a shout out to some local peeps if
you guys are curious I'll have their
Instagram down below you can check it
out or their website I'm not really sure
if they have a website but if they do
I'll have that link down below and then
the last thing I want talk about is
Windsor so you guys know that Windsor
for me is very much like they got they
kind of got everything that's on trend
for a really affordable price it's cute
so this is one of the hats I mean
actually my sister had this hat and I
liked it so I bought it for myself as
well it's corduroy I love the color
this bodysuit is life it's a very deep V
and pretty open back but I thought this
with a denim jacket kind of half off
your shoulder would be really nice on
night out obviously you couldn't wear
this in the winter during the day but I
thought for the night out this is really
cute and the last thing I want to talk
about is this shirt because it's so cute
it reminds me what it reminds me of that
70 show take it easy well I love it I
love the colors I love the fit it's so
cute and I'm really really happy with it
I love it it's so soft it reminds me of
a brandy tea to be honest but yeah that
is everything I've got in the past like
two months since my last haul and you
guys know that I do sometimes haul on my
blogging channel you guys should check
it out
links always down below sometimes I even
showed these items but yeah I hope you
guys enjoyed this video if you did make
sure to give it a thumbs up so that I
know you like oh I still have makeup on
my hand but so that I know you like
these types of videos I'll continue
doing them I really want to do a thrift
store haul like I really want to do come
shopping with me while I go thrifting
and then doing a haul go try on haul of
all the stuff I thrifted get a lot of
questions about that I love thrifting
and I never usually include it in my
hauls because it's kind of like one of a
kind you can't really buy it but I feel
like if I show you guys how I go
thrifting and how I find really cool
pieces that would be really fun so let
me know if that's something you want to
see I love you guys and I'll see you all
