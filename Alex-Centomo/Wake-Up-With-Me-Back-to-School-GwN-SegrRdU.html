so I mean fast you I like what you're
really pretty and you want to be my
girlfriend are you serious yeah this is
a joke no it's not um okay two thumbs up
for cheesy intros am i right guys I mean
this is literally what happens when I
wake up in the morning for school so I
like to start off my day by washing my
face I just find it's really refreshing
and I use my origins cleanser I will
link everything down below what I use
and I also brush my teeth but I forgot
to show that in this video I swear I
brush my teeth guys and now moving on to
my favorite moisturizer which is the
Aveeno daily moisturizer with SPF 15 I
like using moisturizers that have an SPF
just to protect your face from the Sun
now moving on to my foundation I
actually like to prime my face before I
put anything and today I'm actually
using the Tarte BB cream it was the
first time I'm using it and I actually
really liked it it covered up all my
redness and got rid of all the blemishes
I didn't even have to use concealer it
was awesome
plus being able to apply it with your
hands is pretty awesome now I'm just
going to add a little bit of under-eye
concealer just to get rid of those dark
circles that I have from waking up super
early in the morning now I'm just going
in with some bronzer to kind of add a
bit of a contour to my face and also
darken it up a little bit because the
foundation was a little bit light for my
skin and my body was a lot darker so I
had to kind of match it and I'm just
brushing out my eye brows to get them
ready I'm using the honest as yeah I
guess brow Wiz or whatever it's called I
actually really like it but I do really
suck at doing my eyebrow so if you guys
have any suggestions please leave them
down below because I would love to be
able to do my eyebrows differently now
as for eyeshadow I like to keep it
simple so I'm actually just putting a
bit of my bronzer onto my eyelid just to
kind of deepen them up a little
a bit and I don't want it to be too
overpowering because this is a no makeup
makeup look and then of course just
adding some of my favorite mascara and I
will definitely make sure to leave the
products listed down below just because
I don't know them all off the top of my
head but I just like mascaras that give
a more natural look and add length not
volume and then going in with some
Revlon I believe like lip color thing I
actually like to smudge it into my lips
a little bit so it kind of like stains
your lips and it's not just on it and
then I add a lipstick on top and again I
like to smudge it into my lips just
because I find that by doing this
ensures the color stays on all day even
when I'm eating and drinking it just it
literally stays on all day which I
really like and here's the completed
look I just like how natural it is and
for the hair I really like to keep it
simple I love braiding so I'll take the
top section of my hair and I'll just
kind of throw the other section back and
I split that section into two and I
fishtail both of those sections and then
I actually really like to pull those
sections apart to make the fishtail look
really really big as you can see I'm
doing here if you are interested in how
to fishtail I will link my video down
below where I explain in detail how to
do a fishtail braid sometimes I'll add
in some extensions for I guess like
volume and stuff not really for length
more for volume of anything because my
hair is pretty thin but as you can see
here I'm just pulling out the braid
making it more thick and more full
looking because I just really like that
style you can keep it thin if you guys
like but I just like when the braid is
like very full and then I will throw
those two pieces behind and then I'm
going to do another fishtail with the
back piece but I'm going to really
really pull this piece out and if you
could see I added in some little braids
here and there just to kind of give it
some texture but then this one you
really want to pull it out a lot like go
crazy make it look messy because the
Messier the better the fuller the better
as you can see it's like super thick and
full looking which is pretty awesome is
kind of like I guess the Blake Lively
look I was going for that she wore her
in appearance and then you're just going
to put those two things back on top
secure them in place and then a really
cool looking braid comes out that looks
like you took very long time to do but
it literally I think this took me like
five minutes naughty
so it's pretty sweet again I just pull
it out and there you go
I really like it I think it's super cool
now if you really don't feel like
fishtailing here's a separate thing that
kind of looks like a fishtail but not
you literally split your hair in two and
then you twirl them in towards each
other stick your finger through a
section pull them apart and then start
twisting again towards each other so you
want to make sure you're twisting each
side towards the other stick your finger
between the both pull them out and then
continue twisting and I don't know how
this works but this kind of creates a
fishtail looking braid but it takes like
30 seconds which is awesome and again
just adding in a few little braids kind
of adds it some texture and this is
actually really cool so I decide to
leave it for today then once I'm done
with my hair and makeup I like to move
on to breakfast because I need to eat
something for school it's super
important and I am gluten intolerance so
I just make some gluten-free oatmeal add
some fruit and cinnamon and that is
normally my favorite breakfast to eat
before school because it fills you up
right into a recess or lunch and when I
do have a good breakfast in the morning
I never feel tired which is awesome so
then I will just go and change into my
outfit for the day and as I'm leaving I
see my dog lying on the floor like a
lazy flop so I decide to pet him and
then I'm just out the door
peace out y'all ooh I hate myself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
