it has been a bit of time since the last
video I did in this series and there is
a reason for it and that is because we
have not had any time to go look at the
rest of the venues if you guys have not
watched our previous video or don't know
anything about us I'm engaged and we are
in the process of looking at venues
before we figure out our date just cuz
you can't really have a wedding date
without the venue because you need the
venue to be available for the date so we
filmed a video looking at four different
places I think a month ago so I'll have
that links down below as well as right
here where you guys can click and watch
that video first and today we're looking
at the other half so we did like one
side of the island of Montreal and now
we're gonna be looking at the other side
of the island we just got a lot of
options and we have a few requirements
that we're looking for but I explained
that in the first video and I'm just
really excited plus its full time right
now so everything just looks so so much
more beautiful and we are looking at the
fall time for next year for a wedding so
it's gonna be good I think because we'll
be able to see what its gonna look like
at this time of year next year and I'm
really excited I'll show you guys what
I'm wearing so now you guys are all
curious about that I have this top on
from brandy which is just very simple
obviously it's grey but it's a really
light material and it's very chilly
outside today so I thought this would be
good to kind of layer under a really
thick jacket I will be too hot with the
jacket and the sweater but I felt like
if I was wearing a really thick sweater
then I probably would be sweating a lot
jeans I'm wearing these ones from ASOS
and my windsor booties
yeah really comfortable and very
fall-like as for my makeup the only
thing I'm wearing on my lips is the Kat
Von D liquid lipstick in bow-and-arrow
it looks like this I usually wear lip
liner with it but today I didn't because
I lost my sharpener and my lip liner
needs to be sharpened if any of you guys
ever sharpened a lip liner with a pencil
sharpener
I've always wondered if I could just do
that is it the right size like can I do
that is that bad for it I know the
reason why I am vlogging right now is
because I decide to do this series on my
main channel just because a lot of you
guys are super curious and I don't want
to always have to like direct you guys
back to my vlogging Channel vlogging
channel is more of an everyday thing
this is more of like my wedding so I'm
going to be filming the whole process
venues
when I'm finally getting fitted for my
dress the bridesmaids everything like
that the men in their suits the flowers
the food the music decorating everything
is going to be documented so you guys
could see get a glimpse into what I like
or what we like for our wedding I keep
saying that and I feel like Monica and
friends and it's really bad it's our
wedding I'm just in the habit of saying
me because it's my channel but you guys
know what I mean right I hope so because
I am not that kind of person obviously
things are definitely gonna change as
the time goes on like what we expect
right now versus what the finished
product is gonna be I'm sure we're gonna
change so many things throughout the
months and I'm sure things aren't gonna
work out as planned whatever I have no
experience in weddings or anything like
this none of my friends are married I'm
the first out of all my friends to get
married the only wedding I've been to
recently was Dan's older sister and that
was like three or four years ago and I
don't really remember much from it so I
have nothing to base this off of and
we're all new to it so if you guys have
any tips feel free to leave them down
below if you are married or you're in
the process of planning your wedding
anything you think will be helpful
definitely leave it down below in the
comments cuz it would be a huge help for
me and Dan because we are very very new
to all of this are you excited to come
with us
you're gonna be a part of our wedding
boo you are so I decided to tuck in the
gray turtleneck I thought it was really
pretty and then I have this huge jacket
over top dad's wearing his new jacket
and his new shoes you guys like I love
you so cute
we are around 10 minutes away from the
first place that we're visiting this
spot daniel said a friend of his or
someone he knew from high school got
married here recently and he's on
Facebook and he was like okay I'm gonna
reach out to you because it was really
pretty
so we'll see what it looks like and
we're keeping in mind that if a place
looks one way and we don't love it we
can still picture in our head like how
we can switch things around to make it
more ice our style and with tables and
decorations and all that kind of stuff
so we're trying not to make like harsh
decisions right away we definitely want
to keep everything in mind by the end of
the day as long as they're offering us
what we like meaning accommodations and
all that stuff and does really matter
right it's just for us to get married
cute little farm area I feel like I was
here as a kid pretty sure I have I've
definitely been here I remember that
Train thing too
oh my god a 100% I've been here as a kid
because it's a train track that was
around in a circle that's pretty cool
mom or dad if you're watching this do
you recognize this place you please let
me know because I remember this exact
train track here like this little corner
remember standing at the fence and
watching Kyla where my cousin Rick go
through oh this is so pretty
there's a merry-go-round babe wow this
is so beautiful really amazing give it a
fall wedding is so pretty what about you
Dan what do you think about fall like I
love October it just depends because
some months it's warm and some once it's
cool you know some highly depends on the
year even this path is really pretty
okay this is exactly what I had pictured
like in the forest Wow all the trees
this is beautiful
boo do you like it
look at the swing maybe like the chairs
there's a sound system is here and
everything Wow
so this is a backup if it rains or it's
cold so beautiful yeah so this is
another option in case it's raining or
too cold it's like you can all the sides
open up so semi ok save I love this
place this is really nice this might
actually be a talk yeah I think this is
my favorite so far this is so beautiful
there's so many options that's that I
like that all the backups it's good
because depending on the weather or
whatever and there's a hotel that's like
ten minutes away that's something really
good for people that are coming out of
town oh this is so pretty
I love the white okay guys I absolutely
love this place it's really sunny out
right now but oh my gosh she was so
friendly and so helpful they're also so
flexible with the dates with the menu
and everything like that they give you
so much like range into what you can do
what you want they can do vegan
vegetarian midnight meals and I don't
know Dan what did you think this place
is really nice and the flexibility is
what sells it the most for me is like
they're they're really good with food
and backup plans and decor and setting
and everything they're really flexible
I'm just gonna go check out the other
places but I think honestly this one
definitely takes the cake
so far I just love it so we're at the
second location outside Kevin Oh sick
which is a sugar shack it's another one
really beautiful I love all the leaves
we're trying to get boo to go to the
bathroom island right outside it's
really pretty
the only thing is there's houses like
right next to it look how pretty
okay perfect soon
look how pretty it is guys it's so cute
let's see all the trees I love sugar
shacks and I love the woods and over
here it looks like there's a lot more
woods is it bad that I'm just like
walking and going to see for myself I
will wait for her but I just want to
kind of get a glimpse of this forest it
reminds me of the other place we were at
the first time from the first video I
hear a horse it's so rustic so pretty
here you see the woods Wow
sorry a fireplace so they get rid of all
the cherries and it would be like a
dance floor I guess that place was cute
it wasn't our favorite but it's
definitely good to keep in mind you have
a lot of options only downside to it is
it's like right next to people's houses
so like literally where the ceremony is
is like someone's backyard
- dad made a good point he's like
wouldn't it be weird if we're getting
married and like this people jump in
there something fall right there so yeah
I guess would be kind of weird snow like
fence or anything so we'll see it was
good to see you around knowing that's
good I like again this is another place
that's like really flexible with where
you do the ceremony with what you
decorate with what kind of food you want
they're flexible so that's always a good
thing but I think the other place was
still more flexible and I liked the way
it looked better yeah
plus it was really secluded and like
they said you'd have it all private
yourself
the next spot that we're going to I
actually have been there before my aunt
and uncle got married there and I was
their flower girl I was eight years old
and I still have so many good memories
from that wedding it was insane like I
think of that place and I'm like I have
nothing but fun good memories it was
probably one of the best times in my
life as a child my cousin Rick who was
like my best friend at the time he was
well he not he was he is two years older
than me he was the ring there and we
just were like it was so fun so it's
gonna be so cool to be back there and
see what it's like as an adult cuz all
my memories that I have that could be
skewed right because as a kid when
you're small and you are out of place it
looks so big and what's very beautiful
but I do remember being fancy so we'll
see not that we're against fantasies we
want more like rustic but we'll see what
they have to offer and I was just so
excited to be back there it's crazy and
said he saw horsies what beauty on a
pony
oh so beautiful
you
so if I don't recognize it but we'll see
once we go in it is where they got
married okay your mom's you remember no
but I remembered when you showed me the
pictures online
like seeing the grounds I was like oh my
gosh I've been there before
and I was like is that her commands
wedding and then my mom said yes lots of
parking
it's a Chateau meaning a oh there's a
cemetery right there that is creepy a
Chateau means a castle but it's not
really a castle that's familiar the pond
this path is so pretty yeah this is oh
my god that's so weird oh my god that's
so weird like without benches that's
what we stood to take pictures and then
they let the doves fly and over there
whoa that's so weird
that's cool that you get to remember
like the nostalgia whoa I haven't been
back here since I was eight years old
you could see here it's kind of like a
mini Chateau the top is supposed to look
kind of like a castle the Chateau st.
Antoine it is cool that's so cool that
my aunt and uncle got married here and
say it's one of the halls
this is what I really remember and like
the gardens out there that place is
really pretty I think it's more like a
nostalgia thing for me I still like the
first place best thought we went today
what about you this is definitely
gorgeous it's beautiful it's not my
style yeah it's too fancy for me but
that's just my opinion if you guys if
people like that oh for sure yeah we
wanted more like a rustic feel what but
this place is absolutely stunning like
it's so beautiful we just got back home
now and I'm just so happy with how
everything went I'm pretty sure we're
gonna go with the first venue that's the
one we both liked the most what's great
about that place like Dan was saying how
everything is just very open to that's
boo sorry to change and we can switch
things up we can do it kind of any day
also a date that we're gonna choose is
gonna be a private day so there's going
to be no other weddings there which is
really great it's just gonna be us in
our wedding party and all of our guests
or not the whole place to kind of do
what we like and another great thing is
that there's no houses or anything
around it's very it's secluded but not
creepy like it's just perfect
we're not gonna hear noise we're not
gonna make create noise for anyone else
it's just gonna be like us there's
accommodations ten minutes down the road
the food looks amazing they spent so
much time just like showing us
everything and just being so personable
and it was great so I'm really really
excited
I will obviously let you guys know when
we do book the date and we are gonna be
talking about it I'm gonna be sitting
down with my bridesmaids I'll probably
do a Skype session with test as well so
she can be included and just talk about
not logistics but what everyone's
thinking for Bachelorette bridal party
all that kind of stuff I really want to
do something in New York so also that's
easier for test two but like we all love
New York and I think would be really fun
to like rent a suite or something and
just do like a big fun party but we'll
see maybe we'll travel somewhere else I
don't know but I'm so excited to bring
you guys along and give this video a
thumbs up if you enjoyed it and let me
know down below if you have any other
suggestions for our wedding if you have
any
ideas what we should do if you're
excited for it don't forget to subscribe
and turn on those notifications I love
you guys so much and I'll see you all in
my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
