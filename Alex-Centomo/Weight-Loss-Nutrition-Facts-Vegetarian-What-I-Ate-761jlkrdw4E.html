channel I decided to film a what a AIT's
a video I feel like this is going to be
a little bit different because it's also
kind of an explanation as to like why
certain things nutrition a little bit of
education when it comes to that through
Daniel who's not professionalized want
to throw that out there but he has been
a lot of research and has a lot of life
experience with this kind of stuff so I
thought about big idea plus this is kind
of what's been helping me get on track
with like losing weight getting more fit
this that my mister in the bathroom and
just feeling better about myself so
without further ado let's get started
there are things first after my workout
is my premier protein that I have every
single time after I go for a run and
train and stuff I just think it's great
as for the benefits of this I will have
Daniel explain it to me once again and
I'll write it down the description I
just know it's really important for me
to drink this after a workout but it
tastes really good I got them at Costco
and I just drink it with a straw and if
anyone knows where to get straws that
aren't plastic like I reuse these I
don't know if it's bad like I wash them
and then I just reuse them but if I can
get like metal straws or something I see
those a lot on Pinterest and Tumblr and
I think they're a lot better for the
environment but let me know in the
comments down below where I can buy
those if you can like add a link that
would be awesome but yeah first things
first
got to get some protein in my body
creating sewers that are dying
so as for breakfast these are all the
ingredients that I'm going to be using
so I'm making an avocado toast this is
the bread that Daniel got today it's
three grains and oatmeal it's just a
really I guess healthy bread I don't eat
too much bread but when I do this is
typically the one that I really like
anything that has lots of oats or seeds
or brains in it is really good I don't
typically read like how many calories
and stuff are in bread because I just
don't think that's important like I know
for most people that is like a huge deal
but I think as long as it's like whole
wheat if there's lots of like seeds
grains oats you're good and yeah I mean
I don't eat bread too often and you
so it's not the biggest deal but I'm
going to toast two slices of this as you
can see they're not that big they're
pretty small but I usually have two and
then what I do is I cut up the avocado I
put it in a bowl and then I put a tiny
tiny little bit of extra virgin olive
oil that just makes the consistency a
lot more smooth and then I do a tiny bit
of salt and pepper I use a dash of cumin
I actually use a lot of cayenne pepper
because I like when it's spicy and also
some red chili pepper flakes and some
paprika and then that's basically what I
do to make my avocado juice and it's so
yummy this is essentially what it looks
like before I mix it all together
basically the more colorful my food is
the more I like it
so that's kind of what my motto is and
as you can see here that's like the only
olive oil I put tiny stem L mmm so here
is the finished look I know it's not
like pretty or anything it just tastes
amazing and all the flavors put together
make it like mouth-watering then I'm
going to have a huge glass of water as
well and enjoy this so I just had done
read the back and like explained wise
because I don't know anything
so there's check marks that say only 75
calories per slice which is good like is
it good to look at that stuff I don't
agree with how many calories but some
people are very specific with that but
in my personal opinion I don't agree
with it but it gives you a good rough
idea but more importantly excellent
source of vitamin D very high source of
fiber even in the nutritional facts
charges lots of fiber very low in fat is
red and there's no sugar there's lots of
protein and it also had a calcium and
iron so why is it good to have fiber
fiber is good for your digestion it's
really help for like poop yeah poop you
know it has obviously lots of other
benefits too but it thanks shirt by the
way thank you a nice shirt this is
really good great yay thanks Dan
low fat very healthy and also why is it
important to have protein after your
workout you need to replace like the
glycogen that you lost in your muscles
so you need to have like some quick
sugar good sugar don't just you can be
and then then when your muscles break
down you also need to replace
so it's good to have protein right away
oh that's a good like healthy sugar
protein little bit of healthy fats with
you but I'm not sure if that had a v12
added to it I think it does for you
which is good because you don't need
meat yeah just some b12 added to let's
even better for you yeah I got to take
my daily my multivitamin you can look at
all I like never read these things I
probably show it huh you can look at all
the vitamins that are added to this
thing so it's very healthy it's almost
like having a multivitamin till also
should I not take my woman Centrum thing
no that's fine I mean you're not really
going to overdose on vitamins if you do
you might have some like kidney damage
by the child it's really hard let's
watch your Matt is really hard to
overdose on vitamins you have to take
like a bunch of multivitamins a day okay
I trust you and why do you know a bunch
of this stuff
we're like English well I used to reason
I used to read a lot of books about
nutrition when I was swimming uh-huh so
it's just like sort of self-taught
knowledge I guess and I'm so like
dealing with a lot of nutritionists and
like when you have used to have people
help us and stuff but nutrition is one
of the like the subjects in the world
where you can get super different info
yeah you can read one book and it'll
tell you one thing and you can read
another book it'll tell you the exact
opposite like Oh ank you really good for
your other book don't need a grain it
all sort of depends on what you're
looking for but there's sort of like a
general consensus in what's good
information by Daniel is thanks babe
so for dinner I'm going to be making
these spring rolls they're so freakin
good so I it's not a package like this I
know how they're like a like outside
packaging anymore but I get them at
Costco there's a vegetarian ones gluten
free they have like no GMO they're
actually really really like well not
really really healthy but they're super
healthy for spring rolls I love the
sauce it's like this sweet sour sauce
so typically have this for dinner and
then sometimes like Daniel makes veggies
with meat and I'll like take a few of
those veggies and then I usually have a
snack afterwards like a bit later on
there so YUM so you just put it in the
oven at 375 for I do nine minutes on one
side and I flip them and do nine minutes
on the other side some win for the stick
heat up but I'm so hungry so I think I
might actually I don't like to have a
snack before dinner because sometimes it
sells me but usually like these mini
hummuses are really good so have a few
crackers with some hummus you have these
like sweet potato crackers that we get
from Costco they just have grains and
stuff they're really yummy so it's
pretty good for portion control because
then you don't like me you way too much
hummus because that's definitely my
issue so good look how good they look
just watching happy gilmore this is what
it looks like on the inside cabbage
carrot lots of veggies so yummy so good
eyes enjoy this video I did quickly want
to say I serve Russia for my lunch which
is really defeats the purpose of this
video but what I usually do for lunch is
I just make my own salad so just throw
in spinach and kale is like what I do
every single time to the other greens I
use it's super simple but I do
hard-boiled egg and then I do peppers
cucumbers onions like either green
onions or red onions
I do chickpeas or any kind of bean and
then I also do sometimes lentil
sometimes not and I like to throw in
walnuts and a little bit of cheese and
then after the dressing either a light
ball sonic or light honey mustard
something very simple and basic like
that day I was running around a lot and
I forgot to film it which is so down but
if you guys really want to see
video kind of all about how I make my
salads because they're really really
good let me know in the comments down
below and also please no judgments on
things that I eat every one is different
listen to your own body if you want to
eat more eat more you just have to
listen to yourself based off how much
exercise you're doing how you're feeling
again I do everything to kind of extend
my life as much as possible I try to be
healthy I try to you know being eating
healthy and just helping physically it
helps mentally as well so it's a big
reason why I'm a very big advocate for
that if you enjoyed this give it a
thumbs up let me know in the comments
down below if you want to see more of
these videos I kind of want to make them
more both a regular thing showing more
ingredients joy more cooking things
because I love to cook and I think it
would be really beneficial
