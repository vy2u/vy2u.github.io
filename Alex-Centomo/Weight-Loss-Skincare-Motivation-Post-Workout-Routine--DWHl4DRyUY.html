my channel first of all I just want to
point out that how the leaves in the
background are changing and it's so
beautiful and also I have a sleeping
puppy at my feet and it just makes me so
happy so I'm just in a really good mood
right now before I get into anything I
just want to say that this video is in
collaboration with Tula that being said
let's get into the video so I've been
getting so many questions lately kind of
about my overall health in general my
skincare routine haircare workout
routine weight loss all of these kinds
of things and if you guys have been
subscribed to you for a little bit you
guys know that I've been kind of on a
health journey health kick kind of
bringing my life into a different
direction because I've always been a
very active person I've always been kind
of somewhat healthy the one thing I
don't talk much about is health as a
whole kind of everything together in one
video where you can kind of just get a
sense of where I'm at in my life right
now and just everything that has been
working for me lately that I thought I
could share with you guys and help you
guys out in some way or help motivate
you that's kind of like where I want to
be is just like a motivator for you guys
and to help get you guys as healthy as
possible so one of the biggest requests
from you guys is workout routines and
I've done so many workout routines on my
channel I'll have a playlist linked down
below for you guys you can go check it
out nothing has really changed I kind of
switch up my routine based off of the
season but I've done routines for like
every season so far I feel like there
were kind of me no point in showing you
exactly what I've been doing at the gym
cuz it's really not much different than
my last video as for the whole weight
loss thing I know a lot of you guys were
very confused when I made a video saying
that I lost around 20 to 25 pounds that
is because I'm not that I'm short but
I'm quite tall when I gain weight it
kind of goes throughout my whole body
you don't see a massive difference as a
whole and so I was able to lose 25
pounds and not look completely different
like I couldn't tell and my closest
friends and family could tell it was
more of a hell thing because I was
eating so bad and not
no but ever since I started working out
and eating a lot healthier
I've been going kind of like this so
sometimes I'm really good I'm like on my
game I'm working out every single day
I'm feeling motivated like six times a
week at the gym and then one time like
went for long walks or run outside or
something like I'm feeling so good I'm
eating really good eating at home making
all my meals doing everything in my
power to make myself as motivated as
happy as possible then as life sets in
you kind of go down sometimes it's
completely normal and at that point I
start to feel a little bit more lazy I
start eating out more I'm tired because
of the dog and I'm like you know what
I'm so lazy to make myself some food
it's just easier if I like go buy sushi
at the store or something and don't get
me wrong it's totally fine to eat out I
have nothing against it but like I say
everything in moderation and I was doing
it every single meal not good I was
skipping breakfast because I would be
like running out the door busy or like
working and forgetting to eat and it was
just not good so this is kind of where
up and at lately if you guys have been
following my vlog Tober you might have
noticed that at the beginning of October
I was so busy like I was doing things
all the time working being with friends
going out doing stuff I wasn't in my
routine that I normally was so in
today's video what I really want to talk
about is kind of how to stay on track
what I do when I get back to the gym
that helps with my inner health as well
as my outer health like skincare because
I get so many questions about my skin
how to continue this lifestyle for a
little bit and see if you guys can do it
with me because I want to do it together
it's like kind of my goal to be able to
do stuff with you guys I think you can
help motivate me as well as I can help
motivate you and doing things as a team
sometimes it's just really good so if
you guys have watched my work routines
you kind of know the sense of what I do
at the gym coming up back from the gym
is kind of the most important thing to
my routine because for one it helps the
most with my skin care and acne as I got
older my skin started getting really dry
but I still was getting a lot of acne
and it was just frustrating and I had a
lot of acne scar
I don't know if you guys can like tell
on camera but in person like you can see
it was never anything I was
self-conscious of like I never really
cared that I had pimples and I never
cared that I had acne scars it's not
something that I like was really upset
over but I've been doing a treatment
like recently that is actually helping
with my acne scars which I'll talk about
in a little bit as well as doing
something as soon as I get back from the
gym or as soon as I am back from doing
something active where I'm sweating my
skin is combination skin and it's like
really annoying every time I would get a
facial do tell me oh you have the most
complicated skin blah blah blah and like
it was this whole big thing it was
always very frustrating because like
trying to get my skin healthy was my
main goal and I think I've kind of come
up with the routine now to help that the
first thing I do want to come back from
the gym is make sure that I've rinsed my
body
if I'm not taking a shower which I
normally do or a bath or something but I
could take like wet wipes you know like
either baby wipes or just any kind of
wet wipe that's for sensitive skin and I
kind of rub it over my chest sometimes
they even bring them with me to the gym
and I rub them here because I sweat a
lot here and I tend to break out and
used to really confuse me cuz I was like
I don't understand why I'm breaking out
so much on my chest and I realized
because when I sweat at the gym and then
it dries it clogs the pores and then it
starts to create acne the same thing
with my shoulders and like the top of my
back so I started just using wet wipes
and that's helped a ton sometimes I just
even use baby wipes but I do suggest
rinsing your body as well like it's kind
of a must for me but at least with baby
wipes or whatever you can bring them to
the gym and wipe yourself off and then
rinse yourself when you get home or if
you shower at the gym that's even better
as for my face so I've been doing
something called micro needling this is
going to be a whole video on its own
because I'm doing a before and after and
I'm still in the middle of doing it so I
don't really want to go into much detail
about it yet because I really want to
see how the results are at the end of
all of the sessions and I can show you
guys like pictures from before and after
zoomed up like high quality you could
see my face and see if I really
recommend it as of right now I don't
know I've only done two sessions and you
only see results after five so far I
really like it my skin is feeling
amazing after it I'm kind of excited to
talk to you guys about it because I
think it has helped a ton with acne
scars but as for my skin as a whole and
getting my skin
see I have a few products that I'm going
to show you guys because it has been a
long time coming
that I have been testing out this
routine I'd say definitely a few months
now like it's been a while I've noticed
a drastic difference you guys have
noticed a drastic difference in my vlogs
as well as my videos and I'm just really
excited to talk about it because I think
it could really benefit you guys there
are two face washes that I use the first
one is the one that was given to me from
the clinic that I get my micro needling
and this is an exfoliating cleanser it's
very light so it's not abrasive it
almost doesn't even feel like an
exfoliator but it's just enough to kind
of get off that dead skin that
accumulates around my nose and it's
really good - after my micro needling
sessions and my skin tends to get really
really dry I don't use this every single
day but this is just something that was
from the clinic it's by the brand skin
medica and it's called the aah a BH @bh
a exfoliating cleanser on to my holy
grail product which is the Tula cleanser
this line which I'm gonna talk about
right now I am collaborating with them
to make this video but I just want you
guys to know that I've been testing out
these products like I said for a few
months now and they have done stuff to
my skin that has not done anything
before so I was like you know what I'm
gonna do this video because you guys
need to know it I think it's gonna help
you guys a ton these are just a few of
the products that I've been using I use
this morning and night and then I use
the serum the serum I'm like complete
almost completely out of it like I don't
know if you guys can even see but it's
like down to where the Tula part is here
so I've used all of this I've had it for
a while but don't you have to say that
Daniel does steal my stuff I know where
it's going this is the illuminating face
serum and I think this kind of ties
everything in together because this it
fights deep down into the skin like the
underneath layers and it helps with
those ones so that when that finally
comes to the surface it's not as dry as
it would normally be it's really light
and texture it's not sticky it applies
really smooth and it dries pretty quick
but it's not drying the next thing that
I love is the eye cream I have never
used an eye cream before on a regular
basis and I used to think that it didn't
really make a difference Bobby
I am getting a lot of fine lines around
here and it has helped a ton with
reducing the fine lines and I've
actually noticed a difference because
when I wear makeup
normally it would kind of sink into the
fine lines even if I were to apply
primer and powder it would still seep in
and you would be able to see it ever
since I started using this like I'd say
around a month in it that doesn't happen
anymore
now as through moisturizers I use two so
the first one by Tula is in this pod
here and as you can see we've used a ton
of it but this also because Dino steals
this all the time because he loves it
it's the hydrating day and night cream
the only thing is once in a while I will
use this one when my skin is extra dry
like after I get my treatment done with
the micro needling because this is the
one that was given to me from the clinic
and it's by skin medica again and it's
just the h a5 boys riser and this is
like when my skin is actually flaking
off from the treatment what I love about
the Tula products the most though is
that they use probiotics in their
formula I was always aware of it when it
came to your inner house like eating
yogurt with probiotics are just eating
anything with a probiotic in it it's
good for your gut it's good for your
insides and the one thing I haven't seen
on the market I've never really heard of
is probiotics in skincare whatever is
going on inside of your body that
probiotics can help with is gonna do the
same thing for your skin and I think
it's really really smart they did that
my biggest thing is that you guys have
noticed it like that's my biggest thing
and I have I put off this video for a
long time so I wanted to make sure that
it was the products that were doing it
and it really is also a really cool
thing is in sanskrit tula means balance
and this was something that i took to
heart because you guys know my tattoo
here is the own symbol my whole message
and what i want to do is about balance
everything in moderation everything
balanced I think it's the most important
thing for anyone to try and be balance
in their life in their relationship with
themselves I don't know everything about
the brown kind of just was me also Tula
is hooking you guys up with 20% off of
your first purchase so if you just go to
Tula home slash I like see Tula calm /al
exc I'll have a link to down below for
you guys
20% off your first order and I honestly
guys like I really really genuinely
recommend these products to you I think
it's going to make a huge difference and
a huge plus to the brand is it is not
tested on animals they don't test on
animals it's so good I'm so happy it's
like everything about the skincare brand
is perfect and exactly what I love I
feel like I'm kind of on a path now to
like real health I'm back into the
routine of getting healthy at the gym
working out making a lot of my own meals
I'm working on my skin I'm working on
kind of everything in my life my
relationships I'm just trying to make my
