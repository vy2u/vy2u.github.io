video heading it to the gym I have a
massive pimple on my forehead yeah it's
really it's you know I should name it
it's been there fruit heading off to the
gym
certainly 18 past 7:00 in the morning on
the what's the date today
September 5th wow it's raining outside
but it's not very cold which is really
good because it's been a little bit
chilly lately and as much as I love fall
weather as soon as it was a little bit
warmer outside this morning I just was
kind of feeling very very chilly the
past few days the reason why I'm
starting the video here and not with
like the first thing I'm eating this
morning is because I just want to kind
of explain something to you guys so when
I do these types of videos I don't do
them so that people can tell me what I
eat is wrong or what I should be eating
or that whatever kind of stuff this is
just me expressing to you guys what I
enjoy eating I do eat quite healthy
majority of the time like I'd say I know
what you think down like 80 percent yeah
yeah like 80 percent eat very very
healthy and then there are some days
where I do like to enjoy indulge but I
don't do any like cheat days in a sense
of like just eating crap food all day
because I enjoy the foods I eat that are
healthy so I know everyone has like an
opinion on food and that's totally fine
like I'm never one to pass judgment on
what anyone else decides to eat like
it's totally their own decision so I
would love it if we could keep it
positive in the comments and just about
what I eat and I don't want to see any
of these comments being like oh you
should watch this or you should read
that like I've seen everything I know
I've read so many things and then
still this is the way I want to choose
to live my life so please just respect
that and with that being said I think we
should just get into the video because
that's why you guys click to watch this
right not to hear me
just talk about nonsense but let's get
into it okay guys back from the gym I
showered washed my face like I always
say I start off with a lot of water in
the morning and usually when I get back
from the gym I'll have a protein shake
thing but I think I'm just gonna make
myself breakfast right away because I'm
very hungry right now so I'm thinking of
making myself an acai bowl okay so I
know this is vegetables definitely need
a banana I use half for the smoothie
part and then half for like the toppings
and I already have some cut-up blueberry
and strawberry but I think I might need
more so I'm just gonna grab these
blueberries oh we also have something
here these are the fresh farm ones do
you think they've gone bad okay see I've
been using this space in Costco because
I ran out of like I'm not run out we
actually couldn't find the acai thing at
Costco but this is just really good at
raspberries blueberries blackberries and
it just makes it super red yummy
so we're out of almond milk but I'll
just use water because in all honesty it
tastes the same and so that's basically
what I use to blend for the smoothie and
with a bit of water then over here I
have chia seeds which I put on top with
some of these coconut chips they're so
yummy I think yeah we have some over
here to see how much we're kind of weird
anymore
this I also have mahogany teak wood
burning because it smells so good and
last but not least granola which I need
to rewrite on the thing I think we need
a little bit more so the first thing I
do when I make my
I call them acai bowls even though
there's no acai smoothie bowl I guess
and I put a scoop of granola at the
bottom and this makes a huge huge
difference because all the times I'll
eat all the toppings and then it's just
smoothie left and I kind of don't love
it but at least here you get a bit of
granola at the bottom that you can kind
of mix in with the rest of the smoothie
once you're done your toppings
so big reason why I use a food processor
rather than just like a magic bullet or
something or just like a smoothie
blender basically is because it makes it
actually thicker in my opinion like it's
more like a sorbet or ice cream base
rather than like liquidy and I like it
when it's more like ice cream because I
love that consistency and I just find
that this works really well this was a
housewarming present it's by this brand
I don't know what that is yeah that's
what that's what we use
this is the finished acai bowl or
smoothie bowl it's so good you can add
honey on top if you'd like but I think
this is sweet just as it is and it's so
yummy and super filling as you could see
the bowl is massive
okay guys flash forward a little bit
later the current situation right now is
I have a little dilemma so I'm about to
make myself lunch but I have dinner
plans tonight with my friend Emma we're
going for sushi and it's currently 3
p.m. and I'm meeting her for 6 so if I
eat now I'm gonna be really full for
dinner but I know we probably won't get
our food to like 6:30 6:45 maybe even 7
so I decided to make a soup and because
the soup is like my favorite thing to
make this time of year like fall time
it's starting to get chilly where I live
so chili vegetarian chili that sounds
really good but speaking of chili I
guess this is kinda like a chili soup is
basically all vegetables really Hardy
really yummy and keep in mind maybe you
don't follow this exact because I like
things really spicy and I know a lot of
people are not into that so you can
always not put in some of the spices and
again I don't do everything precise like
I kind of just throw things in I taste
it see if it feels good feels good
tastes good but essentially these are
the product products uh-huh items I used
to make a really good hearty vegan soup
it's so yummy so you'll need 3 large
carrots I use 3 because I just find this
is the best portion one full bell pepper
you can use any kind I just have an
orange one and it does make it sweeter
usually I'll use one large onion but
these are pretty small so I'm going to
use two and then I have these two small
cloves of garlic which I actually got
from the local farm and then one thing
of vegetable broth and this is the
no-salt-added one and I use a full thing
of this what's great is that I can
actually keep the rest of the soup as
leftovers and use it a different day
then I have black beans any kind of
black beans I use a full can as for
spices other than salt and pepper
because I'll use salt and pepper but
those are like over my stove I have
paprika
this is cayenne pepper this is chili
powder
some red pepper flakes sometimes I'll
put a little bit of garlic powder but
we'll see and that is essentially all
you need to do so what I'm gonna do is
I'm going to what is this peel is that
oh that's where this is called the
peeler I'm gonna peel the carrots chop
them up chop up the bell pepper as well
as these two things get everything ready
and then I'll show you guys what to do
next
also make sure if you are using a knife
and stuff just be very very careful I
don't want any of you guys getting hurt
so yeah if you are very young make sure
you have a adult help you with this and
if not just whatever if you're like an
adult then ignore what I just said and
doing your own things
guys oh my god
onions like chopping onions affects me
so much who you know that expression
it's like there's a sad video and you
watch it in someone comments like with
someone cutting onions here like
literally me look at this oh okay maybe
actually I think I only need one cuz
that was like a full bowl of onions and
I think I'm pretty good plus I don't
want to cry anymore
so then I just put a large pot on high
and I put some oil in there you can put
anything you want olive oil canola oil
coconut oil whatever you think I just
use olive oil extra virgin olive oil
because it's what I have on hand right
now yeah just about that much I mean
it's spreading out now because it's
getting hot and the first thing I'm
gonna do is put the onions in there to
saute for around 3 minutes and when I
see them start to turn a little bit
clear / see-through then I'll add in the
garlic for like another 30 seconds to a
minute mix it all in and then I'll do
the rest
honestly this smells so good just cooked
onion I just added the garlic now I'm
gonna stir this up for a little bit
making sure it's not getting stuck to
the bottom too much you could avoid this
by using more oil but I don't think you
need to and I'll honestly like I don't
mind the charred nests of it puts over
oiling things just tends to get oily so
now I'm gonna add in my carrot and
pepper one fell out and you will
probably want to let this cook for
around five minutes just until the
veggies are a little bit more soft I'm
gonna add some salt and pepper to this
while this is cooking this is the point
where I added my spices once the veggies
have been cooked for a few minutes
before five minutes I like kind of in
they're half way mushy I like to add in
my spices and this is the time where I
don't do exact I kind of just throw
things in
yeah then like let it cook a little bit
and see how that tastes once the soup is
like simmering and I'll always add in a
little bit afterwards but yeah I just
take these ingredients and kind of just
porn like a teaspoon two teaspoons just
look look a little bit here and there to
give it some flavor
then I'm going to add in a tiny tiny
little bit of this puppet Iike paste my
grandma gave this to me it's from like a
hungarian store because she's obviously
Hungarian and just this is its chimney
again I don't know what that is in
English I think it means sweet so it's
more of a sweet one there's also a hot
one but this just adds a little bit of
sweetness and it's really good I
honestly have no idea where you could
find this it's just this brand and it's
the Chan making one so if you could see
on top here it says that yeah I just
rinse the beans though then this is what
makes it taste more like a chili so
yummy so I am just gonna stir this and
then add in the full thing abroad
so what you're gonna want to do is just
bring it to a boil and once it's at a
boil you're gonna turn it down it to
like medium low heat and let it simmer
for 20 minutes and then you kind of
taste it and stir it throughout those 20
minutes and see how it's going and then
it should be done okay so you see how
it's boiling now then I'll just bring
this thing and down to like in between
whoa that's really steamed up a low
temperature and then let this simmer now
for 20 minutes and I'll kind of taste it
probably in like 10 minutes to see how
the flavors are coming along and then
adjust accordingly if you find it too
spicy you can add a little bit of sugar
if it's not spicy enough or salty enough
add you know just based off of what you
like and it's I swear guys this is so
good it's hearty and it's healthy and
it's like yummy so it should look like
this when it's done you can either keep
it like this or my personal favorite
thing to do is blend it because I like
soups to be like thicker not creamier
like I like creamy soups too and I love
using coconut milk but I feel like maybe
not for this one this one I just use a
this thing or it's just like me you know
what I mean like it just blends it
together it makes it thick and so yummy
it's like chili basically
so now let's say if I turn everything
off the soup should look more like this
if it'll focus so yummy guys it's
actually so good oh my gosh okay so I'm
gonna taste it I have this little Bowl
oh my gosh it's hot though so I have to
be really careful oh wow oh my god
that's so good
yep and there's still some big chunks of
carrot and stuff so I like that but most
of it is pretty like thick mmm oh my
goodness
nice look at this it's so yummy if you
try this recipe you have to let me know
one how you like it and two if you did
make any changes what were they and I
might try it next time I'm gonna indulge
in this and then get ready to go for
dinner
I mean we're only gonna be eating in
like two and half hours so I should be
fine but I definitely need to eat before
I go because or else at least are being
and then I will not have eaten enough
today because as much as sushis awesome
i only vegetarian sushi and there's like
not much to it really because I get full
off of sushi very quickly cuz of the
rice so guys I'm out for dinner and I
