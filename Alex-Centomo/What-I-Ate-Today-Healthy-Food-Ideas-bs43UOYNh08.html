which I'm sure you can but I actually
dyed my hair yesterday so this is the
first video that I'm filming with my new
hair just got my ombre redone my roots
are still natural like this is my
natural color and then from here down
they just redyed it and kind of did that
like balayage thing where it's more of
like the streaking ombre than just like
the cut ombre so it's more
natural-looking and it's super blonde at
the bottoms and I really like it a lot
I've been getting so many requests from
you guys to do a what I ate today video
and I did one of these in the summer I
believe yea I'll link it down below for
you guys but if you follow me on
snapchat which you should because I love
a using snapchat obviously my story's
public and sometimes I reply to you guys
so that's always fun to a little
surprising message but I have been
showing a lot of like kind of what I eat
and stuff in my snapchat stories and you
guys are screenshotting them like crazy
and setting them to me on Twitter and
you're like oh my gosh like you should
make a video about like something that
you eat throughout the day and since I
have started eating healthier I'd say
like my lifestyle has definitely change
and I am eating like way better than I
was I just figured that I would kind of
not like vlog style but show you main
things that I eat throughout the day and
hopefully you guys enjoy it without
further ado let's get into the video
breakfast is the most important meal of
the day my opinion so I make sure to
never skip this part because I want to
be fueled for the rest of the day so
today I just like to have some Greek
yogurt with blueberries bananas and some
gluten-free granola
it was super filling and amazing
delicious oh my gosh I love adding
blueberries to everything because they
are full of antioxidants and they're
great for your nervous system and brain
development fun fact about blueberries
for y'all
ever since I started working out like
crazy I have been loving this fit T it's
just a detox cleanse but I've been using
it for the past two weeks
and I absolutely love it it's just a
blend of all natural ingredients and it
just basically keeps me super energized
for my workout and I love it I drink it
around 30 minutes before I go for my
workout and just FYI this is not a
sponsored video I actually just really
enjoy this tea
after a really intense workout I love to
make smoothies I'm sure most of you guys
that follow me on snapchat know that I'm
obsessed with smoothies today I decided
to have a green smoothie so I started
off with some chia seeds a handful of
spinach and then a bunch of frozen fruit
I like to keep it around mangoes peaches
strawberries and then half a banana cut
up and then I love hemp hearts they are
full of fibers omegas and proteins and
of course adding some coconut water 100%
pure is amazing and kind of pulls it all
together and then I just blend it in a
blender until it's completely liquefied
and then I enjoy and it is so good guys
I'm telling you oh my gosh
I'm obsessed with it and you don't even
taste the spinach it's very sweet and I
know I love it I enjoy having smoothies
after a workout because they kind of
just replace all the electrolytes you
lost when you were sweating I then had a
spontaneous lunch date with two of my
good friends so I just had some split
pea soup and this like really good bean
salad and coleslaw and egg salad and it
was awesome for dinner I just had
whatever my mom made so she had some
chicken some steamed broccoli which was
so good oh my gosh I'm obsessed with
this and then some hot sauce for the
chicken and then I kind of just cut up
some red pepper and added some hummus
because I really liked that and felt
like having it and it was delicious
flora dessert I kept it healthy and had
some of my favorite fruit in the world
which is clementines and they are
amazing at this time of year I love them
oh and Here I am just being a crazy
person like I usually yeah and let's
just take a moment to appreciate the
sexiness
I hate myself
so I hope you guys enjoy that just
simple kind of way to eat today and well
actually that was yesterday yesterday
but it's funny because I had this whole
meal planned out for the day and then it
was kind of like last minute my friends
were like comfort didn't come for lunch
Alex we really want to see you so I went
I decided to go for lunch normally I
haven't like eaten out so long so that's
a lie it out the other night I've just
been loving to eat more like of a
