be filming a what a 8 today video and of
course I love filming it on my blogging
camera so this video was so requested I
love that you guys love seeing what I
ate I find these videos really
interesting but I feel like what I eat
is so boring but I've been eating really
healthy lately so I feel like this could
help a lot of you guys also these things
could be really good for back to school
I hope you guys enjoy and let's get into
the video so what I like to do first
thing in the morning is make a big glass
of lemon water I drink a lot of water
throughout the day but I just find
adding lemon to it not only makes it
taste amazing but also keeps me really
energized because I work out first thing
in the morning usually can't eat a meal
before I work out so definitely drinking
a big glass of lemon water helps with
energy a lot and I also just really like
I don't know the taste and it makes me
hydrated and I just really like it so I
recommend you guys drinking like a whole
thing of water first thing in the
morning and then I just kind of like a
refill up this glass throughout the day
and drink a ton of water so the next
meal I love is oatmeal
I have ami almost every single morning
or porridge whatever you guys want to
call it
this is gluten free oatmeal it's brown
sugar maple with ancient grains it's
pure oats obviously it's the quick
oatmeal doesn't take a long time to make
I just like boiled some water and I
really like it I got it from this like
health store near where I live and then
I add bananas on top of it with a little
bit of cinnamon sometimes I don't think
I'm gonna go for this and then cinnamon
today cuz that's a bit sweet but this is
what it looks like yep I managed to
spill it everywhere but it just looks
like this and then you add the water in
this is hard to do when I'm foaming okay
I'll be right back guys so this is it
it's not too much porridge but I put a
lot of bananas and I put a huge a full
banana but they're the big ones so that
is what I eat so good and with of course
another thing both lemon water on the
side because I just keep refilling this
so eonni and delicious usually when I
work out in the morning I get extremely
hungry and I kind of eat like constantly
throughout the day I don't have like
three main huge meals I can't eat like
five smaller meals and they're just like
snacks and stuff so right now I'm making
a smoothie and use these strawberries
frozen mangoes another banana and then
I'm gonna put half a banana in here add
some chia seeds and hemp parts and just
some plain old water and blend that up
by the way I just use a plain old magic
bullet for this does the job
and this is the finished product it's so
good and it's like thick kind of like a
milkshake tastes amazing so if you guys
watch my blogging channel you will know
that I'm obsessed with this salad place
near my house so I am here again so I
got a kale salad that this one has lima
beans cranberries I dried cranberries
and what else is in here like
cucumber and a bunch of stuff but it's
so good and then this is a quinoa salad
which is amazing as well and then this
chickpea bean salad which is so good I'm
obsessed with this and I try something
new like every time but like this one is
like my favorite it's amazing this is
dinner you know mother sebasi house yeah
Wow so it's amazing and everything's
gluten free hey hope you guys enjoyed
