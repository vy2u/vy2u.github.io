channel I am using my vlogging camera
again today because I decided I was
gonna film it what I ate today video I
haven't done one of these in like a
month two months and I get so many
requests to do these and the last time I
put one up so many of you guys said to
do one every week which so much but I
figured like maybe once a month I could
do that for sure and I was kind of
planning and seeing how I want to film
this video and then I just realized I'm
going to New York City I'm doing a road
trip and I always I'm curious to see
what people eat when they travel
especially if you have restrictions for
a long time I was gluten intolerant
recently I was able to start
incorporating eating gluten back into my
diet very slowly and it's been fine I
haven't been getting sick so I'm really
happy about that
but then also I don't eat meat so then I
was curious like what do people eat when
they're like on when they're traveling
because a lot of times you're restricted
so I thought what perfect way to do this
video then to film it while I'm road
trippin to New York City so I'm going to
show you guys what I'm eating for
breakfast what I eat when I stop on like
not my lay overs but I guess when I'm
driving because it's like a six hour
drive so when I stop to eat lunch then
when I'm in the city what things you can
eat and stuff and yeah if you guys seem
to enjoy these videos give it a thumbs
up to let me know I'm gonna get started
the video right now so first things
first in the morning I usually like to
drink a big glass of water and sometimes
I feel lemon in it just because I find
it tastes really good and there's
something about lemon that really helps
boost your metabolism throughout the day
so it's good to have this first thing in
the morning and it just tastes really
yummy so since I am kind of on the girl
I'm gonna make myself a smoothie so I
have bananas frozen berries so like
blueberries I think these are like wild
blue blue blueberries then some frozen
mango and then I put chia seeds on top
and then I'm just gonna add water and
blend that just cuz I don't want to put
any like milk or anything anyway I don't
know I don't like that I just like water
and it usually tastes really good
my gosh guys it's actually so good YUM
I just love banana and berries I think
it tastes so good together and then I
add a little bit of mango cuz I love
like the taste of mango and it just
gives a hint so it's real good oh my
