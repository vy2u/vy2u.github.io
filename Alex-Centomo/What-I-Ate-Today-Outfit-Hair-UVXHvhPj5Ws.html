camera today which is actually so fun I
haven't filmed on my vlogging camera on
my main channel since I think the fall
like definitely like September October
time and I think I am due for another
what I ate today video it has been a
very long time since I filmed one of
these I think that's because I blog a
lot so on my vlogging channel I show
what I eat but never on this channel and
I get so many requests from you guys so
I just figured why not but what I'm
gonna do a little differently in this
video is I'm gonna show you how I'm
dressed today what I'm gonna do with my
hair so it's a little bit of like an
OOTD slash get ready with me hair video
as well as what I ate today cuz I'm
feeling in a really good mood I'm
feeling super happy and positive which
is you know I feel happy a lot but I
just feel like really energetic today so
on my face all I'm wearing is a powder
like I'm not even wearing foundation I'm
just wearing a powder on my face I did
my eyebrows I'm wearing my new mascara
that's like the fiber mascara from
covergirl the new one it's amazing I'll
have it linked down below and then on my
lips I just have a Charlotte Tilbury
lipstick color which I'll also have
linked down below because I don't
remember it off by heart now but it's
over there somewhere as for my hair I
curled it like what sorry that's Dan um
yeah so if you guys don't know I
recently died I just dropped my
extensions if you guys don't know I
recently died re dyed my hair I still
have ombre but it like it's gone we're
up now it's more of like a balayage and
then at the tips it's a little bit more
like white / silverish / purple I did
that purposely for Coachella but my hair
is still pretty much like that so I
thought I was going to put in my
extensions today these are the
extensions they are the foxy locks clip
in extensions that are already on braids
I did tone them a little bit so that
they matched my hair color like at the
bottom once they're blended and
everything they look great but I'm
actually just using two tracks today
because I'm gonna do two separate braids
in my hair I wanted to do kind of like a
really bohemian big braided hairstyle
with two braids so I think I only need
extensions for this so I just have two
of the two clip ones and I really like
these extensions cuz look they're like
super thin at the top and you can't even
see them when they're in your head like
I had two braids for Coachella and one
of them was sticking out and nobody had
any idea cuz at the end I was like oh
gosh couldn't you see that and there
what smell so I really like these I'm
gonna put them in and then show you what
I do um I also just realized how greasy
my hair is because it has been five days
since I washed it so I'm gonna be using
this stuff which is my new lifesaver I'm
obsessed is the Herbal Essences naked
dry shampoo smells amazing works amazing
you literally just you know and then you
you get the point
so as you can see I clipped them in just
in the back I Spit my hair in two I did
from like the base of my neck really
only need two and then I'm going to
French braid my hair all the way down so
one side is done that this is the top
and it goes all the way down into the
braid which is super nice and I'm just
gonna have done to film the back so if
you can see like this you so now both
hair is braided or I kind of pulled them
out in the back but I really like this
look a lot and with the extensions it
just adds like length and volume makes
the braids look super thick and amazing
so if you guys are curious about these
extensions I'll have a link listed down
below in the description for you as well
as a coupon code and if you use the code
foxy Alex you can get free lashes at
checkout which is awesome so make sure
you check them out I'll have like the
exact ones that I use and they're
awesome they come with a full set of
tracks so when you want like big
balumptuous' waves and curls great for
that as well use them for the first day
of Coachella amazing and I really like
the way these feel because they're super
thin so like you can't see them you
can't feel them it's great and I love my
hair as for my outfit I am wearing this
super oversized sweater that I got in
Maine it says Maine literally it's just
like a tourist sweater but I'm obsessed
with it I have an obsession lately with
like super big oversized sweaters
because where I live it's still kind of
cold its spring but it's like
um like eight degrees which is like I
don't know 40 in the 40s Fahrenheit so
I'm wearing this big oversized sweater
with some black leggings and asked for
shoes I am just wearing my adidas Stan
Smith's all white with the black in the
back and some socks these leggings are
from garage and I feel very comfy and
sporty and chic today loving this new
sportswear style because it's so
comfortable one of the first things I do
every single morning is drink a whole
jar of water sometimes I add lemon or
lime and ice but today I'm just drinking
regular water and this just really helps
boost your metabolism and start up your
heart and everything like that so it's
just really good to have water all day
every day but first thing in the morning
I drink a full thing of like this is
huge and I drink the whole thing
so starting off my breakfast I'm gonna
make a smoothie Bowl / a soluble but
it's not a sigh it's movie
so all you will need is some granola
this is just gluten free granola because
I can't have a regular one because I am
gluten intolerant for those of you that
don't know that then some chia seeds and
then frozen strawberries and frozen
bananas and some almond milk right here
I just use this one from silk it's just
the original almond milk I basically
don't blend this but I blend all of
these ingredients together and like
either magic bullet or just a blender
you can kind of judge the size of it for
how much you want and then on top I'm
gonna put some granola and then fresh
bananas and maybe a little bit of fresh
concedes bananas are the best when
they're spotty like this so that is what
I'm gonna do
so once I poured it into my bowl I'm
gonna take your granola and you're just
going to sprinkle that on top you can
make it pretty with like a design I kind
of sprinkle it all over it really
depends what you like but this is what I
like lots of granola you know and this
is the finished acai evil oh my god this
is massive I'm so excited to dig in you
can add some agave syrup if you want on
top but I think it's sweet enough just
like this sometimes I'll sprinkle some
more chia seeds which I might do but oh
so good oh I can't eat one more bite
that was so good we've got a boxed water
with my life
so this is the cell that I got from
Mandy's and as you can see there's like
a bunch of lettuce I got chickpeas brown
rice avocado black beans yeah there's
just a bunch of fun stuff in here so
it's really good this place if ever
you're in Westmount or downtown Montreal
check out Mandy's there's salads are
awesome you can custom make them and
yeah they're not sponsoring this video
at all I just really like it there and
I'm excited to eat this so I just
finished my salad and I'm gonna have an
apple now cuz these are some of the best
apples ever and nothing I'm still hungry
but I know if I don't have this I will
be hungry in like an hour so this is
really good it's just like a Honey Crisp
apple so for dinner my dad makes this
incredible tomato sauce he uses real
Tomatoes like big ones and cherry
tomatoes with a bunch of spices and oh
my gosh it's incredible every time
people come over look they're still a
chunk of like baby tomato right here
every time people come over they look
upset over it cuz it's a little bit
sweet too anyways some pasta with the
sauce obviously gonna have gluten-free
pasta and it's just like incredible I
wish you guys could taste and smell us
right now because you wouldn't literally
die it's so good the last thing I'm
eating today is a jugo juice and this is
a mighty kale so there's kale spinach
mango pineapple a bunch of other fruits
and veggies really good and really fresh
