place from marmalade if the whole world

hobbies and bobbies be there with you
and over the only truth every
whose bite
for money on for breakfast I got a
cheese and tomato toasty with salad the
quests on by the way is amazing and so
is the cafe light snack I am having some
fresh strawberries that I just washed
and cut up I don't know why but the
strawberries in the UK or just England I
don't know they just taste like candy

perfect snack and I just wish we had
strawberries it tastes like this back

good but this literally tastes like
