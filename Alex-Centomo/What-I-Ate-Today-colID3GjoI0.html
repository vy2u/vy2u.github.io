bit different than what I normally do
because I'm on my blogging camera right
now but I recently watched Anna Saucony
film a what a Wednesday video which are
like my by far my absolute favorite
videos ever and I get so many requests
to do what I ate today video and I did
one not too long ago but I really like
the whole vlog concept of it so I
thought today I would bring you guys
along with me and show you what I'm
eating in like a vlog form so I'm just
gonna be using my vlogging camera and
showing you what I'm eating today and I
hope you guys enjoy it so without
further ado let's get into it
so I'm starting off first with a cup of
tea in the morning this is actually a
tea talks cleanse that I've been doing
for the past I'd say two weeks I have a
morning in night one and this is just a
morning one if you would like to see a
video all about this tea then definitely
let me know because it's so good and it
has a lot of benefits and stuff too it's
actually a new one I've been trying out
that was recommended by you guys so if
you're interested in seeing a review let
me know yeah so this is right before I
have breakfast I love having this before
workouts and stuff is okay guys I
excused for the noise because I'm at a
restaurant but I just got this smoothie
it's like a banana strawberry and orange
juice like freshly squeezed orange juice
smoothie
and it looks so I'm not gonna have this
and then I also ordered some food and
Tricia Bango Bango put mango banana
orange juice yeah and then you got that
looks so good guys Montreal bagels are
the bomb it's like a smoked salmon and
cream
guys everywhere in Montreal have a seat
gator babe yeah this is my meal
I got a cheddar and bacon omelet oh my
god looks amazing with some potatoes and
my fruit is just in my smoothie and I'm
really excited to eat this cuz it looks
so good
this next meal is one of my favorite
things by far I actually found the
recipe on Pinterest so I'll leave the
link down below because I'm not too sure
over the measurements I kind of just
like guess to me obviously if you want
to be precise that's good but it's just
regular Greek yogurt this is just one
from my local like grocery store zero
percent fat regular then we just need
some lemon juice but I like to use a
like real lemon rather than just buying
lemon juice some celery then a can of
tuna this is the one that I get it just
flaked white tuna and I just get all of
the oil out of the can before I dump it
into a bowl and then cucumber a dill
pickle a pickle pickle the recipe calls
for dill pickled relish but I just like
to use the real pickle and if you don't
like pickles still put this in there
because it does add a really good flavor
I don't like pickles normally but it's
amazing in this trust me and then some
garlic just use a clove of garlic red
onion an avocado that's already right so
I take around a quarter of a cup of the
Greek yogurt I just plop it into it like
a medium sized bowl and then I take half
an avocado and I just pour that into
here and then what you're gonna do is
you're just gonna take a fork and you're
gonna mash it and just mix it together I
just use a regular fork until it's all
blended evenly so when it's all nicely
blended it should look like this I like
to keep it a little bit chunky but you
guys can use a food processor if you
want it more like pureed but I like it
like this and if I didn't mention before
this is a tuna salad without any mayo
it's very healthy and it's real
good for you the next things you want to
add in is a little bit of garlic salt or
onion powder I kind of like the garlicky
taste better then some sea salt and some
black pepper as well as your chopped up
dill pickle and garlic you're then gonna
want to take your celery your red pepper
your cucumber and your tuna and just
finely chop all of it I kind of like to
have bigger chunks but if you don't like
the feeling of that or the taste then
just you know chop it as you desired and
you're just gonna add it in to the rest
of the bowl stir it and then add a bit
of lemon juice and you're done this is
what it should look like afterwards it's
so unbelievably good guys oh my gosh and
then what I like to do is wrap it in a
gluten-free wrap and then have it like
that or you can put it on some toast or
whatever you like or just eat it out of
the bowl like that they're all really
really good and what's great about after
I squeezed in half of this lemon I just
cut up the rest of it and add it into my
glass of water so you end up using the
whole lemon and it's delicious
so I'm going to be having a snack before
dinner just because I like to eat quite
often and I'm just going to have some
almonds normally I like them when
they're not salted I actually kind of
hate when they're salted but this is all
I had in my house so I'm gonna have a
couple of these just to hold me over
until it dinner ties look at this drink
that sadie is having for dinner it's a
cucumber a virgin cucumber Spencer yeah
it's not what it is yeah and if there's
real cucumber curing and ice you want to
try it on camera notes this idea by the
way
it's really good yeah this is what I got
if you don't watch my blogging channel
you won't know this but I was literally
at this restaurant like two days ago and
I came back but this is they homemade
lemonade it's so good and yes I'm eating
out a wat and today this actually
doesn't happen this often but that's
just what's goin on today it's Friday
and it's nighttime and we're going out
for dinner so homemade lemonade with
cranberries and lemon and it's so yummy
so I got the same thing as last time
because I'm actually obsessed with it
but it's called the Roses salad and
basically inside there are carrots just
on top with some shredded beets
cucumbers feta cheese chickpeas there's
these things called banana peppers which
are spicy and they're amazing
there's just lettuce and other amazing
goodness but look how great this looks
I'm so excited
so this is Ryan's meal a burrito
huge
I mean finishing off tonight with the
tea that I explained from before so let
me know in the comments if you guys want
a more detailed video about this tea
it's amazing it's so good I said that
like a hundred times in this video oh
and if I didn't say before the
restaurant I was at is a vegan
restaurant it's vegetarian gluten free
vegan all that stuff I'm not vegan but I
do enjoy vegan food it's really good and
it's called Lola Rosa for any of you
