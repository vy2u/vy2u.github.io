that I get to upload a video today I
asked you guys in my last video if you
wanted me to post two times a week and
you guys all really really wanted me to
and then I asked which day you guys
wanted to see during the week and you
said Wednesday I think with like the top
rated day so yeah I think my schedule
for the rest of the summer is gonna be
every Wednesday and every Saturday which
I'm super excited about because I love
making videos for you guys what I think
I might do is like during the week I
might post a smaller kind of video maybe
a vlog or something like smaller since I
do work still at brandy Melville in the
store I don't have as much time but I
still want to put out some more videos
for you guys and then Saturdays are
gonna be my more edited like I've no
tutorial slash fashion videos and stuff
like that for you guys so if you guys
are excited or have any other
suggestions just leave them in the
comments below anyways getting on with
this video I'm super excited because you
guys have been wanting to see this video
for a very long time I was gonna combine
this with my workout routine video but I
think I'm gonna keep that separate
because I want to go into more detail
when it comes to nutrition and stuff in
my workout video so today anything I'm
just gonna take you along with what I
eat during the day so I'm gonna fill in
little snippets of what I'm eating and
kind of like living like the healthy
lifestyle as you could say cuz I know I
don't need super super healthy guys um I
do exercise on a regular day basis uh
and I drank plenty of water and a lot of
tea but I I know I'll have like a bag of
chips or like french fries here and
there I mean I don't you'd like the
healthiest but I do eat like somewhat
somewhat healthy I've been seeing a
couple of beauty gurus do this so I hope
you guys enjoy it
starting off with breakfast I love to
have Greek yogurt with fruit it's my
favorite thing to have in the morning so
I just need a bowl with some Greek
yogurt blueberries and strawberries and
then I just mix it all into the bowl
together so the first thing I do is take
some Greek yogurt and this is the
raspberry flavor which is my absolute
favorite I take around 3 scoops of that
and then I add in the fruit and
blueberries and strawberries are just my
favorite you can add in whatever fruit
you want and I just think that together
with the Greek yogurt it's so good and
it fills
me up for the morning and I just love it
so much I mean how good does that look
guys seriously oh I wish I was eating
this right now on to lunch I actually
had sushi for lunch today which isn't
really homemade but I mean it's sushi
guys come on it's amazing so I just had
some California rolls and some lemonade
which is actually homemade if you guys
want to see a homemade lemonade recipe
leave it in the comments below now onto
my first snack of the day I need to
snack throughout the day or else I get
starving for dinners so I just like to
have a little bit of hummus and some
Tostitos this hummus is a roasted red
pepper hummus which is really good I
just found it at my grocery store and I
like these Tostitos because they're corn
and they're just amazing they're so
yummy
on to my second snack and this is
actually by far my favorite thing to
have during the day it is dried mango
it's so good and nutritious
I just am obsessed on to dinner
I am so obsessed with salad so tonight I
decide to make a chicken salad
consisting of all these products so I'm
using baby spinach baby kale some
strawberries some cucumbers some
asparagus craisins which are really
really good in salad and some pecans and
then of course some chicken which my
boyfriend just soaked in some homemade
dressing I don't know what he did then
I'm just gonna chop up some cucumber I'm
a huge fan of cucumber and I really like
it in salads so I like to cut diagonally
just cuz I find it gives the most flavor
you can cut it however you like now it's
time to boil your asparagus so I have
just a big pot of boiling water and
we're gonna add some asparagus to it and
make sure you stir it around and then
you're gonna want to put the lid on top
of the boiling water and keep it open
just a little bit so that you can let
some of the steam come through and I'd
say you leave it around 10 minutes to
get completely steamed now it's time to
fry up some chickens so I'm just adding
some oil into a really hot pan just to
get it ready and then you're gonna want
to add your chicken one by one and leave
it around a minute per side before
entering it into the oven you want to
just Brown the chicken you don't
actually want to cook it completely
because that's what the oven is gonna do
once the chicken is completely browned
you're gonna want to add it into the
oven and I just have it set to 350
degrees Fahrenheit I'll probably leave
it around 10 minutes to let it cook next
is to just add the lettuce into the bowl
so I'm adding the baby spinach and the
baby kale and mixing it all together
lastly is to just chop up your chicken
any way you want it I just kind of like
making big chunks cuz I really like to
taste the chicken one of the meanest
salad and then you're gonna add all the
ingredients together
last step is to just add in your salad
dressing this is a really secret
concoction that my boyfriend made up I
have no idea what's in it it just tastes
like a balsamic vinaigrette but better
and then you're gonna toss it all up and
enjoy wow this salad was honestly so
amazing I really really liked it the
taste of the craisins with the
strawberries - the asparagus and the
chicken it was so good
so that was it for the video I hope you
guys enjoyed it I had a lot of fun
making it I filmed this yesterday
actually so I could show you like
everything what I ate you guys enjoyed
