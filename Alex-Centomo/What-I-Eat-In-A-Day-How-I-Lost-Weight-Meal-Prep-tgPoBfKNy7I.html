my vlog I decided to vlog today because
it's going to be a fun day and I wanted
to record this for you and for myself to
look back on because I watch your this I
know phase the other day of looking back
on old blog footage but I kind of feel
like my channel is missing a bit of that
I don't know
okay this hair like what is this a horn
basically if you guys don't know I have
a vlogging channel already and I do have
a channel with Daniel where we vlog
together but I I've been kind of going
through my main channel videos and
realizing I'm missing a lot of content
that shows just like me and who I am in
my life and so what I'm going to do is
I'm going to kind of throw out this
video today showing you what I get up to
as well as what I'm eating because I
know a lot of you guys are wondering
kind of a meal plan or whatever but I
decided that I feel it a meal plan it's
very specific towards the type of person
of what you want to get done with like
your body or your health whatever so a
meal plan might not be the best idea
because everyone's different so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to start a
series and just show you guys what I eat
on a day where I'm like home working out
kind of my basic routine now maybe that
way you guys can get some inspiration
from that and kind of make your own
meals based off what I do and just know
that obviously everyone's different it
depends what you're trying to do I'm
trying to like tone up as well as like
lose some weight so that's kind of like
what I do when I eat ok spots whenever
this is me no makeup cute right so the
first thing I do when I get up is I go
to the gym so the first thing I do I
fill up this huge thing of water there's
like a nice thing that goes in it and
that's what I bring to the gym I make
sure I drink the whole thing by the time
I get home it doesn't happen and make
sure to drink it with when I get home
again I'm not an expert I don't know
anything about anything which is kind of
just like what I've learned throughout
the years of being an athlete dense yo
ready to go workout yes you guys are
curious to see what I do at the gym
check out my workout routine video that
I put up like last month about my weight
loss
and what I get to do at the gym that
makes no sense stick a link so I know it
might not look like much time has passed
but I am back from the gym it's
currently 917 am and I'm going to have
my protein shake so this is premier
protein at the chocolate one I just got
a huge box of these at Costco I honestly
don't know much about them other than
that dancers are good so he's a lot more
educated than I am when it comes to what
goes into your body so I just listen to
him don't just like blindly listen to me
though you should look at it for
yourself yeah but you said it's good for
me inside that 1 gram of sugar in the
whole thing you barely any sugar and
that's good right yeah shares bad and it
was not bad but you don't want to over
eat sugar
it only had 160 calories in a 325
milliliters thing which is pretty good
and it's 30 grams of protein and that's
good and it has 24 vitamins and minerals
it has b12 so it's great especially for
someone doesn't Mimi yeah but like I
also take my vitamins so true so like I
have these vitamins that I take usually
with lunch because I have it with a meal
so I take two vitamins the first one is
this Centrum for woman it has like
everything that you need for a grown
growing women for growing or enrolled
boys know what you know what I mean like
is good and then b12 because I can't get
this is you've got this an animal meat
and I don't eat meat so I need to have
that replaced so I'm just going to shake
this up and then usually just drink it
out the container with a straw ooh I put
on something sticky that's gross YUM
Cheers okay guys it's currently it this
is so great hold on a second better
currently twelve twelve twelve twelve
twelve minutes past twelve lunch time
and we have our a dishwasher going so
that's why there's not noise but I am
going to be making lunch with Jen
and I'm gonna see if we can turn this
office it's kind of loud and annoying
okay thanks Dan you know we're going to
make lunch together this is one thing we
really love to do is cooking together if
you guys don't know I've always been
really not bad at cooking but just like
not that interested in it because I
always thought that it was so hard when
we were away in Europe our friends
Patton chest we're telling us that they
like to do this delivery service where
you get food sent you that's all kind of
prepackaged and has all the ingredients
that you need and there's nothing that
gets like left over so it has everything
exactly you need to make a specific type
of recipe and so I was like that is such
a smart idea and then you get to
actually cook it yourself with the right
instructions and everything so they said
it was really great we are trying out
hello fresh this is what we're going to
be making today so basically I'll show
you guys the common boxes like this and
each one is a different meal so this is
the one that we're going to be making
for lunch and I ordered the all veggie
boxes because I don't eat meat but I do
know that they have other options but
this is the roasted squash and apple
salad and it's crazy look it tells you
the prep time what is what it is and
then look the level of it because you
know me level one and then it has all of
these ingredients inside and then on the
inside it has all of the nutritional
values what's not included the tools and
then step by step instructions on how to
do it which is like super simple and
then it tells you the exact calories fat
protein carbs all of that great stuff
and then also in the same big box you
get three meals so this is the other
meal that you can make which is smoked
tofu tacos and I think going to make
this one tonight for dinner which is the
farmhouse vegetable grass hanging is
anyplace that's hang but for lunch we'll
be making this one hopefully it turns
out to look somewhat the same it's crazy
because it's different each week so
every week if you do sign up every week
you get different recipe
they're all super simple to do makes it
really fun especially for people like me
that don't really love cooking because I
always just thought it was too hard but
like I said in my weight loss video I
needed something to kind of portion
control because that was my problem with
that I would just like eat out too much
then way too much money at the grocery
store or at restaurants and then just
overeat and like not do it properly so I
think this is a really great way to do
it properly and also I just love the
fact that there's no waste with the food
because that was always a big problem
for me and I just think it's bad to do
that another great thing about
hellofresh is that they always have like
a dietician that kind of goes over all
the meals and make sure it's like really
well-balanced really fresh because they
want to send you the freshest
ingredients oh yes and then of course
it's just always delivered to your
doorstep in like a really nicely sealed
box that's like properly insulated with
ice packs and stuff which I thought was
great because there's nothing more
sending nervous to eat food but there's
no problem with that so it's actually
the first time down I are trying this
I'm really excited again do you want to
come and also it's really exciting
because I have partnered up with
hellofresh oh the promo code I'll have
it right here on the screen I also have
a link listed down below in the
description for you guys to click and
what like all the details and stuff but
basically you'll get $35 off your first
week if you just go to hello fresh comm
and then enter the promo code that I
give you like everything you'll need and
here Wow
oh my god so fresh I'm going to camp so
excited let's weigh everything out
everything is labeled it's so fresh oh
my gosh even this time so the
instructions say preheat the oven to 400
degrees Fahrenheit to roast the
butternut squash and then start prepping
when the oven comes to up to temperature
so number two is wash and dry all
produce one tablespoon of thyme leaves
we have to strip them
our oven is about 400 put it in and it
says 23 to 25 minutes so you want to put
it in for like 12 and then we'll we're
going to give it a little stir yeah
okay okay so then this it says now to
toast the pepitas which are these seeds
and on medium heat so that's what I'm
going to do dry pan
it said toast them up for three or four
minutes making sure that you're watching
them and you stir regularly coming from
the true chef masta dad's actually an
amazing cook yeah we're so cute thank
you so while Gunn is checking on that
I'm going to start with a vinaigrette
you
okay so I just tossed the arugula with
the other dressing and then finish and
serve divide the solid between plates
top with a roasted squash and Apple
sprinkle over the goat cheese
cranberries and pepitas enjoy so we'll
make it pretty like this so I placed the
salad on the plate put some Eclipse
do some craisins and some of the seeds
and then we're just waiting three
minutes so things come out and then I
have the goat cheese which I don't is it
going to be bad if I don't put the goat
cheese on that's you if you don't like
to go - you know I'm not a huge fan of
goatee so I might put sharp cheddar but
do you like goat cheese okay so you try
to goat cheese and maybe I'll have a
bite of yours for good it really does
alright on the goat cheese is going to
like milk a bit because what more goat
cheese on Fox's you know I want to try

watching Riverdale so for dinner we're
going to make this one this is the
farmhouse vegetable giraffe pane so it
comes with all of these ingredients
