much requested video for you guys I
asked you on Twitter the other day what
video you would like to see from me next
and a lot of you guys said what's in my
bag video now I did what's in my purse
or what's in my bag in the summer with
Karina and Catherine but I since then
have completely changed up my bag /
purse and what's inside of it so I
figured what better way to do it then to
show you that made no sense and I'm
rocking at the side pony what do you
guys think I don't know what I think
about it so if you haven't watched that
video I will link it down below but
basically I used to carry around a
backpack everywhere and I never owned a
purse and I just could never find a
person I liked because I'm very picky I
don't like the classic designer handbags
I just it's not my thing it's not my
style that's very much my sister's style
she loves like the Michael Kors the
Louie Vuitton
all of that stuff it's like totally her
thing for me I'm very simple I don't
like that so I actually found an amazing
purse that I finally fell in love with
and it is this one right here so this is
a crossbody vegan leather purse or bag I
know you those of you in the UK I think
a wallet is a purse for you guys so this
bag is I got this from Free People and I
think it's the perfect size and on the
sides there are these like zippers that
you could actually undo which I have
done to make the purse bigger and if you
want it smaller you can zip them up it
comes with these like two little handles
here that looks like a little
suitcase that you're like hold it around
but you can also click on the longer
strap which I actually let you because I
like to wear it as a crossbody and then
the zippers have these little tassels on
them and I just love that look so much
plus vegan leather it can't get better
than that
and this wasn't too pricy I just really
like it and it fixed so much in it like
you'd be surprised plus is black and
there's nothing better than black this
goes with literally everything it's the
perfect size for me so I'm so happy with
it you guys have a no idea how long I
have been searching for a bag that I
could finally just wear out to
everywhere so I'm just I'm really
excited about it so I guess we'll get
started with what's in it I never
actually hold it like this but this I
find looks really cute so first things
first
has this zipper in the middle there's no
pockets or anything just a simple zipper
so the first thing inside my bag is this
notebook so this is just a simple agenda
notebook I got this from I don't even
remember where I got this I think I got
this from my dad's office to be honest
or like staples or something but you can
literally find a an agenda anywhere and
I just kind of keep a pen tucked inside
here and inside of this agenda slash
notebook is just like everything that I
need to do so I have like all my
appointments in here all my meetings in
here all my video ideas and I like to
bring this around sometimes just because
if I come up with an idea or I do need
to schedule something in I will have
this handy I actually don't always keep
this around my purse I have this in
there now because I was
doing something the other day that I
needed to bring this to for but if I
don't have this with me I'll usually jot
it down on my phone in like the notes
section and then I'll add it into here
afterwards but I do ever since I started
doing something like this which is
probably September I just been super
organized and I never miss anything
because I used to do that sometimes so I
love having this plus I just like being
organized and writing it down with like
pretty pens and stuff is just better
than having it all in my phone which I
usually tend to forget about so the next
thing in my bag is my wallet or my purse
as some of you guys like to say why do
you guys call it a purse but this was a
purse I don't know whatever this is my
wallet and I got this from Free People
as well it's vegan with leather as well
but it has gold / copper detailing on it
just in the back has a little sign that
says free people in the front it just
has these little studs I love them and
then it just has the in zipper to open
up the wallet which you know it has all
my identification gift cards cash change
it's a simple wallet good decent size
fits everything it's simple this is way
better than the Juicy Couture when I had
from the summer which was falling apart
my sister owns that one go get for your
condolences because that wallet is just
falling apart the next thing I have in
my bag is a pack of juicy fruit
I always keep gum on me lately it's been
juicy fruit this gum is awesome but last
literally five seconds then you gotta
throw it out which kind of sucks but I
love the taste of this so I don't want
to have the bad breath got the nice
juicy fruit the next thing I have are my
spare car keys because why are these in
here I don't know but I have my steer
car keys then I have my sunglasses which
are actually new I do keep sunglasses on
me at all times because sometimes I'll
be driving and it'll just be really
bright even though it snows here you're
still Sun and it does get really bright
as the snow so the glasses I'm currently
wearing are this just the Lennon son
is from Raven there the 50-millimeter
ones the little bit bigger because the
super small ones just let me look weird
on my face so I have those in the case
small compact case so it fits perfectly
in my wallet or in my purse then I like
to keep this is random but a thing of
tylenol because I don't like to use this
at all times but um if ever I'm
traveling or doing something and I'm
stuck in traffic and I just have a
splitting headache this happens
sometimes randomly during the day I do
drink a lot of water and I eat fairly
healthy but I don't know what happens I
just get a splitting headache something
sometimes so it's great to have this and
just pop one in and I feel so much
better
I do try not to take them that often but
I also find that I'm kind of like the
lifesaver when there's someone that's
around me that has a headache or doesn't
feel well or has crabs and then I could
just like pull out my call and I'll be
like hey here to save the day so I
really like that inside so that's all
that's like in the main part my purse
but then there's also a little zipper
section here which I keep a few things
normally I will keep my phone in there
which is just the iPhone 5 it's the
regular one I've had this for a few
years now and on the case it's just a
free people case that I've shown you
guys before so oh let me know if you
guys want me to do an updated what's on
my phone video because I have like all
of you apps and stuff and I edit my
pictures differently so let me know my a
Oh s lip balm this is in the flavor of
mint I really like it the makes your
lips too tingly and stuff and I just
find a good to have lip balm on you
because your lips get dry and stuff then
I will also keep a little hand cream
this one is from first aid beauty it's
simple hand cream has barely any scent
to it it's just really good at
moisturizing and I also keep hand
sanitizer in my bag but it just broke
this morning like exploded everywhere so
I'll usually like use hand sanitizer and
then use this afterwards cos they'll dry
out my hands normally really love this
stuff it's great and then I will keep
also an elastic like an emergency
elastic in case I need to throw my hair
up or something or this one breaks or
whatever it's just good to have in your
purse and this one is by pura vida' I
believe it's just the simple ribbon alas
and then the last thing will be the lip
color of the day so yesterday I was
wearing this color so I still have that
in my purse I forgot to switch it but
this is just the Revlon just bitten
kissable balm stain and it's just like
the nude color I love it so whatever
lipstick I'm using I'll have that in
there I don't normally keep other makeup
just because I don't feel the need to
touch up my makeup because I find the
makeup that I use does stay on my face
all day so I don't need to do that the
other thing I keep in my bag is my
vlogging camera this is just the old
canon s120 Murrah i am in need of a new
blogging camera because this one has
kind of lasted a long time but i think
i'm going to give this to my sister but
