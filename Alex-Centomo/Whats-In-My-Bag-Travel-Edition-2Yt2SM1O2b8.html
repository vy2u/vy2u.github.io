channel I'm really sorry if you hear any
kind of weird noises there's the dude
that lives across from me is like mowing
his lawn constantly so sorry about that
I decided to do a what's in my bag today
because I really missed these videos I
have not seen someone film this and so
long and I'm always so curious to see
what are in people's but I'm really nosy
based off of my past two videos you guys
know I'm a nosy person I like to see
what are in people's bags and for me it
depends like what I'm doing sometimes my
bag is completely empty and sometimes
it's filled to the max right now it's
one of those times that it's filled to
the max because I just got back from a
trip and when I travel I do bring a
bigger bag to bring on the plane because
I just throw everything in there then I
typically empty it out when I get home I
have not done that yet and before I do I
figured I would go through it because
the weirdest things are in my bag I have
two purses that I kind of rotate one is
my everyday bag and one is like a nicer
nighttime one this one is my everyday
bag so this is my bag this is the medium
size and to go in a bag of IG washy and
it's the all-black one and it's the one
with the longer strap so typically the
way they were made the strap was a lot
smaller and you actually couldn't wear
it like around your shoulder because it
just wouldn't fit it was just more for
the look and people would just hold it
like that or hold it like this which I
thought personally was kind of stupid
because I mean I like to wear bags
around my shoulder and when I'm
traveling if this gets heavy it's just
annoying
this bag is like gone through so much
and still looks amazing and I love black
and silver it's like my favorite thing
but I do think eventually want to get
like a white gold something like that I
got this at the Javan shoe store in New
York City it is like my favorite thing
of all time I love it so much it just
was such an investment but I know this
gonna be with me till I'm a grandma oh
my gosh I wish you guys can you see like
there's so much stuff in here so the
first thing I guess we'll start off with
is my foam since the first thing I see
this is the iPhone 7 plus in rose gold
and this is a case I just literally got
when I got back from the trip it was in
the mail
I bought this off Etsy I do not know the
name of it I literally searched iPhone 7
plus marble phone case and bought one so
I it wasn't that expensive it's really
nice if you are curious to know what's
on this phone and like how I edit my
pictures and all that stuff I recently
did a video I know I get a lot of
questions with that still I feel like
people don't know what made that video
but I'll list it or link it down below
for you guys oh my gosh it's getting so
bright look okay then I have this
portable phone charger and it actually
matches this really well wow this is
from urban I think and I believe Daniel
bought this when we were in New York
City and our battery ran out of charge
so he just got this on our walk or
whatever and it can charge two iPhones
like from dead so it's really good it's
small fits into like a little side
pocket it's then it's great especially
if you can't find outlets that's the
worst or if they're all being taken it's
like next thing in my bag is my little
wallet okay question I call this a purse
but it's a bag but I call this a purse
and this a wallet but I know people in
the world call this a purse and this bag
but to me this is not a purse because a
wallet is where you put like your money
and a purses this is my wallet little
more like a card slot thing and this is
from Stila wrong I got this in London
when I was there last year in December
visiting friend
and um it just has all my cards and
stuff in here really good small compact
black and just has been through so much
and I like it because it has like the
four main slots and then in the middle
you could fit more oh my gosh it's
literally so sunny right now I'm so
sorry
okay guys dan is standing right here
because he's blocking the Sun because
he's awesome I don't think they can sear
it and then when it gets cloudy again
thank you um okay the next thing I have
no it's awkward because you're standing
right there the next thing I have are my
sunglasses and these I got off the
revolt website with their ray-bans
they're like the new aviators that are
fixable what is this again it's like a
anyways I look like this they're cool
they like the little line thing at the
bottom I don't know what shape this is
and I've been wearing them almost every
day honey like today then I have this
hat which I was wearing on the plane
yesterday because my it was kind of cold
but then I got hot so I threw it in my
bag then I have just the thing for this
in case there is an outlet somewhere um
I have also when you travel you bring
carry-on you need like a small bag for
liquid so that's what I have right now
basically just toothpaste hand sanitizer
moisturizer lotion and my little mini
perfume which is by Jo Malone this is my
favorite scent it's the wild pig and
cassis which is now discontinued I'm so
annoyed over it because it's literally
the best thing ever but I stocked up
before they discontinued this is from
the Edition Hotel when I was there in
London they collab with the lab oh and
so I always take the ones that are in
the hotel rooms because they smell
really good
they're good for traveling then I have
some receipts which I need to actually
put away I have a book so I just bought
this book at Costco and I have not even
started reading it yet but it was in the
same section as the two last books I
read so I just decide to pick it up and
it was supposed to be for my plane ride
home but I ended up falling asleep but
just sleeping the whole plane ride so
I'm gonna start reading this soon it's
called the perfect girl and it seems
like kind of a crime mystery which is my
absolute favorite if you guys have any
recommendations for any crime mystery
books that you love list them down below
because obsessed then I have these
papers which are actually um I think
they got them in the mail but they are
the maple leaf club lounge thing for Air
Canada
so because I'm Canadian I fly Air Canada
a lot and they have this membership for
like the world wide lounge things so
they have different lounges in different
airports all over the world and there's
free food really comfy chairs free Wi-Fi
all that kind of stuff so wherever we
are in the world we have these
memberships we can go in and we don't
have to like splurge on food and that
kind of stuff so I just have me and
Daniel's because our cards didn't come
in the mail before this trip but I just
came in the mail then I have this which
should I keep all my medication in for
when I travel it's literally a free
people bag that sunglasses came in I
just kept it so I have like gravel for
nausea
I have advil in case I get any headaches
I have also my pill for if I have a
panic attack which I take very rarely
but they're just like for emergency
purposes because you never know and if I
am traveling for example when I went to
Peru I needed these pills that were for
altitude sickness and that'll usually
put in there then
and I have my passport which when you
fly within Canada you don't need to
bring this you just need ID but this is
my passport Canadian and then I have oh
because there's like a little okay I
didn't explain how this purse works
there's like the big main zipper and
inside that there's a tiny zipper and
two other little pockets that you could
put like your phone or something I
typically don't really have anything in
those pockets but the one of the zipper
I do so I have some gum which is Orbitz
the green one then I have some cards
which are why are these in my wallet
whatever vib Rouge for Sephora I have
air miles and I have my seen points card
which is for Cineplex which is the movie
theater that we have here in Canada and
you get points and you can get free
movies and free food and stuff if you go
see enough movies which we do oh and
then yeah okay here this is the maple
pleat maple leaf club lounge for the
your Canada thing then I have some
headphones which it's so annoying with a
new phone because you have to always
bring around this stupid thing which is
like the little connector because the
headphones that come with the iPhone are
the ones that just have like this at the
end which is for basically the charger
plug and that obviously you can't watch
anything on the plane because it doesn't
plug into the plane so I have to bring
my old headphones with the adapter that
I could plug into my phone it's just
really annoying and like
firstworldproblems then I have lip balm
because my lips always get chapped as
well as a pen because when you fill out
customs forms or anything it's always
good to keep a pen on you this is from
the Intercontinental Hotel in New York
yep that's everything in my bag yay now
I can actually organize it and put stuff
away and make sure that my guys
clean anyways I hope you guys enjoy this
video um I just really enjoy watching me
so I figured out film it plus I have not
shown this new bag ever and I always get
so many questions on Instagram about it
so I will leave a link for it down below
just so you know it is very pricey it
was definitely a huge investment for me
um last year when I got it so keep that
in mind it's not like this is a legit
designer bag it's not a I used to always
live free people bags and then every
year have to buy a new one so this is
just the one that's going to be you live
for ever and ever and ever and ever and
a little bit if you guys enjoy this
video make sure to give it a big thumbs
up to let me know comment down below
