backpack I don't even know okay guys I
don't have a purse for anyone asking I
literally never ever wear a purse I just
carry my backpack or my wallet around

years ago so they probably don't have it
in store anymore but I do know online
they still sell backpacks that are very
similar to this one so if you're
