up guys
so I have been getting so many requests
lately to film a what I bring on my
carry-on bag or what's in my carry-on
bag travel essentials just basically how
I pack all that kind of stuff so if you
guys don't know I've been traveling a
ton in 2015 like I've gone somewhere
every single month if not twice a month
and I am going to be traveling to Greece
in like two weeks I'm going to Santorini
with my boyfriend Daniel and I'm super
excited for that because I think it's
going to be for one an awesome vlog sick
pictures an amazing experience just
getting to like explore the island of
Santorini and eat all the amazing food
and just like be in the Sun I'm so
excited for that I thought I would kick
off this little travel essentials series
with a what is in my carry-on bag since
I'm going to Santorini I am NOT just
bringing a carry-on bag sometimes when I
travel in there for four days it's like
an in-and-out trip I just bring carry-on
luggage so I'll bring like my backpack
plus a like small carry-on suitcase and
a purse but since I'm not doing that
right now I'm just going to show you
what I'm bringing on my carry-on bag if
I were to be checking a huge suitcase so
keep in mind that not everything would
be in here if I was just going somewhere
for four days so oh this is my carry-on
bag as my backpack that it's like my
trusty backpack I love this it's amazing
this is from culture Elliot it's a brand
that has like backpacks and purses and
stuff I have so many things from there
but it's just like a denim jean material
super flimsy and big so right away the
only thing you see is a main main zipper
that opens up the backpack and you have
this front zipper which is actually
really big so I'll show you what's in
the front zipper first so the first
thing I have inside here is my passport
holder I find having a passport holder
very very important because you could
just keep like travel documents and
stuff in here that you need any kind of
boarding passes even though a lot of
times I just use electronic boarding
passes on my phone my Canadian passport
which has the ugliest picture in the
world with me I'm not going to show you
guys
it is quite embarrassing the next would
be a phone charger because the amount of
times I've been traveling and like my
phone has died or something even though
I can't use my phone on the plane I
still listen to music or play games when
I'm bored so I definitely to have this
especially if you have lay overs or
whatever and you're on your phone a lot
you got to make sure you got a phone
charger if you're traveling to a
different country I would suggest
getting one of those converters so that
you could plug your phone into that and
then plug it into the wall I have to get
one of those reminding myself Alex when
you're editing this buy one of those
then the next thing I have is a pen
because learning from my mistakes the
amount of times I've traveled without a
pen and you got it fill out the customs
forms when you're on the plane and stuff
so especially if you're traveling
internationally then I have a pack of
gum this is like my traveling gun
because it's always in my travel
suitcase or my travel carry-on bag it's
the react to five gum I don't know it's
the one that has like it's black it's
weird I don't know why someone makes a
black gum but I like the taste of it and
I find gum is really important when I'm
traveling for wine not only does it
freshen your breath so that when you're
talking to someone they're not like you
know but when I take off and when I land
my ears pop a lot so I find that if I'm
drinking her from chewing gum it really
helps with that so that's another reason
why I have this then I have lip balm
because my lips get so chapped on planes
just the air circulation everything it's
just gross
and I don't like that so I bring my EOS
lip-balm and then the last thing in the
front pocket would be my phone if it's
not on me obviously you put on airplane
mode when you're on the plane this is
just the iPhone 6 I got a new phone by
the way guys so if you want to see an
updated what's on my iPhone video let me
know in the comments down below and I'll
do one for you because I have so many
new apps and stuff and I don't know
getting a new phone getting to rearrange
everything organize it it's awesome and
this case is from Free People
I got it in New York City and I loved it
so that is all for the front pocket now
for the big space I honestly keep like
everything in my carry-on bag because
there has been instances where they have
lost my luggage and I'm stuck somewhere
with nothing so I make sure to pack a
lot in here first thing and most
important this neck pillow thing is my
savior for long-haul flights if you're
on a long-haul flight and you don't have
one of these
I feel so sorry for you and if you
someone that doesn't care about being
comfortable than whatever but this thing
is the most comfortable thing because
there's nothing more uncomfortable than
being on a plane and not having anywhere
to put your head especially if you're
stuck in the middle seat and you don't
know the two people next to you and it's
not like you could just like lean on
your friend or lean on your boyfriend
and if your boyfriend our friend doesn't
like that having this is a big ultimate
Savior because first of all it's just so
squishy and cute the next thing I bring
is a pair of shorts because like I said
there has been times where they've lost
my luggage and I've been stuck in a
super hot area with my airplane outfit
which was like leggings and a sweater
and it was really unfortunate so
bringing up here shorts these are just
small shorts they fit in there and I
like roll them up really tight and then
because the same reason again I bring a
bikini because I don't want to be stuck
in Santorini I guess it depends where
you're going but I wouldn't want to be
stuck in Santorini without a bikini so
this is one of the bikinis I'm bringing
it's from El space this is the bottom
they're just like really classic cheeky
white bottoms and the top is gonna be
really hard to show on camera but it's
basically like the wraparound top so you
put it on and then you wrap it around
the front and then tie it in the back
and it really like holds your boobs in
place and I like it because it's white
and it houses a blue detail on the side
and it's like the Greece colors so I
thought that was perfect
so thanks out space for that bikini then
the next thing I bring of course is my
vlogging camera because I can't go
anywhere without my blogging camera
super important I also have like the
charger and stuff in there as well this
is a canon g7x for those of you
wondering it's the one that has like you
can flow up the screen as you're
blogging yourself so you can tell if
you're in focus or not I honestly love
this and it takes great pictures as well
so this is a really good camera if you
guys are looking into buying it a camera
sorry my dog is working really get to
buying a camera that's my DSLR this is a
really good one next I have to bring a
book because I do get very bored on
planes so on this is the Ellen DeGeneres
blue
it's super funny I love it and I'm only
like halfway through it but I think it's
hilarious it's a light read then of
course I bring my wallet because I need
you need your wallet when you're on
vacation I like this one because you
know a lot of people say to bring
smaller wallets but this is just my
all-time favorite wallet and it fits
everywhere since not a big deal just has
all my cards and everything in there I
then bring a pair of sunglasses these
are key Australia sunglasses the ones
I've shown you multiple times before
just in their case and these are super
sturdy love those the next thing I bring
I put it in this case I bought
sunglasses from Free People and I came
in this like little case but in here I
keep this is some tylenol extra strength
because it happened so many times where
people get headaches if it's not made
somebody else and this is a lifesaver
I also bring my medication because if
you guys don't know I have severe
anxiety / panic disorder and a lot of
times I don't take it on a regular basis
but when I'm traveling there are
instances where I do need that so I need
that and then of course I bring grab all
because motion sickness and just being
nauseous in generals row so that helps
and then the last thing I pack in here
are my like travel-size toothpaste floss
and toothbrush now thank you to Evelyn
Evelyn if you're watching this thank you
she got this for me when I was in LA
because you guys didn't always to bring
like my full toothbrush with me and it
would not fit in anything and it was
really annoying and I have been looking
everywhere for this and they never had
them anywhere so Evelyn was nice enough
to pick up one for me it just like opens
up like this into a toothbrush so then
you got it but you can also close it and
it's perfect for traveling so yeah
finally have this now the next thing I
keep in here is my little small liquid
container if you guys don't know which
you guys should know this but if you're
traveling you can't bring liquids on a
plane like on your carry-on that's over
a hundred milliliters so it's got to be
under so I have this little plastic
container that I got from
which is just like an automobile travel
store here in Montreal so the first
thing I keep in here is some hand
sanitizer this is my favorite one from
Bath and Body Works
it's called hey honey bun it smells like
cinnamon rolls it's amazing then I keep
some moisturizer because um some face
moisturizer because my face tends to get
very dry as well as actual hand
moisturizer and body moisturizer this is
some first aid beauty this one's from
origins and then I bring a face
sunscreen because the amount of times
like I said that I've lost my luggage
and I didn't have any sunscreen was not
a good calls this is by chasse toe and
it's a really good sunscreen for your
face doesn't break me out its oil free
its SPF like 60 or something like that
amazing and it's really different
protection and just like everyday use
you need to use a sunscreen on your face
and then there's also empty bottles too
like they're empty right now because I'm
not leaving for two weeks but this one
has a spray bottle so normally I'll have
like I'll put my perfume in here and
then this one I'll keep like an eye
cream or something you know like oh I'll
kind of fill it up and then I'll label
them what they are and then they just
need to be in a clear plastic bag so
that's that and then everything else
that I use will be in my actual carry-on
so like my body wash and my face wash
everything like that that are bigger
than 100 mil I just kind of pop them and
it's not a huge deal if I lose my
luggage for like a few days because
there's stuff at the hotel that you can
use just in case then I also bring of
course a pair of headphones because I
need to listen to music or if I'm you
know editing on the computer or
something I need headphones I don't own
like friends or beats or any kind of big
headphones just because I haven't
invested in them yet but for now I just
use the Apple iPhone that goes and
they're fine
Fabio needs to stop barking right now or
I'm gonna go crazy then the last thing
is my trusty laptop this is just a
MacBook Pro 13-inch pretty small I don't
have the air or anything but this has
been alive since 2011 it's getting quite
old
um it's not doing as great as it used to
do back in the day I bring this because
for one I don't ever want to lose this
because I need this when I'm itch
because you know guys know I work on the
internet so I need a computer usually
I'll edit on the plane or I'll download
movies and TV shows so that I can watch
them on the plane so a lot of the times
I won't like the movies that are shown
better you know on the actual plane so
I'll download like cuz right now and
watching charmed I love that show I've
never watched it before I'm on season at
the end of season 2 love it I think
ninety shows are awesome so that's what
I'm watching right now and of course
I'll have friends on here because I
always watch friends but that's
basically everything I keep a much on my
carry-on bag and then when I get to the
airport I always go to like the
duty-free and I buy snacks so I'll
always buy like real fruit candies I'll
buy some kind of like chocolate like
junk food and then I'll bring I'll buy
water bottles is obviously you can bring
a water bottle through security as long
as it's empty but might as well just buy
one whatever if you think I'm gonna say
anything please leave some comments down
below or if you guys bring anything else

awesome if I can like add to this or
