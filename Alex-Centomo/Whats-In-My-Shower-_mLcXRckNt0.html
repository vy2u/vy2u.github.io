shower right now which is a little
strange styling in here today I'm going
to be doing the what's in my shower tag
which has been a recurring trend going
around YouTube lately and I thought it's
really cool because I have to see you
know what products people use in the
shower and stuff like that so I thought
I would do that today so let's just get
right into it
starting off with I guess my body wash I
have been obsessed with this clean on me
by soap &amp;amp; Glory it's just a really nice
like body wash I have been obsessed with
this I love the scent and it's just I
think my favorite body wash in general
soap &amp;amp; Glory I'm obsessed with this
product I mean the brand I have almost
all the products that they sell the
smell is really really nice it's very
similar to the Coco Mademoiselle Chanel
perfume and mmm that's really nice so
what I like to do is I use my loofah and
I just pour like one or two pumps onto
it and then I rub it all over my body
and I usually do this after to wash my
hair but it this scent stays on your
hair I mean on your skin all day it's
crazy I will smell it at night and it
just leaves your skin nice and smooth
and soft and I love it the next thing I
like to use is from lush and you will
see that lush is kind of a recurrent
trend is it it is this um this fat bar
actually it's by lush and it's called
Buffy and what I like to do with this is
an exfoliation bar so I will rub it onto
my skin when I went I'll either use this
or a shower gel or like a body wash
whatever but this is I'm use it probably
once a week just to exfoliate get off
all that dead skin and what I like about
this is that it leaves a bit of a
residue so I like to do it at night just
because I don't like the feeling of
clothing over it but yeah so I will just
it'll the last thing I do in the shower
so I'll just rub it all over my body and
then I'll
myself dry and it keeps your skin really
really really hydrated throughout the
night and the next morning can tell my
skin is so soft okay so then I just have
my razor which is just this no Venus
breeze and you can like take off the
things I like the smell of this one I
thought this has a gift actually buy
from my boyfriend's mother so thank you
for that I really like this and then on
to Russia's Turkish Delight this is a
really really really nice body wash as
well it's kind of in a cream form so it
just looks like this
what I really like about this is it
smells a lot like roses and if you guys
like the smell of roses I would really
really recommend this product because
mmm it just it smells like a really
fresh bouquet of roses what is also
really good about this Turkish Delight
cream is I like to apply it before I
shave my legs so it's really creamy and
I just applied all over my legs before I
shave them and it really hydrates them
and stuff so I really like this product
a lot plus it smells like roses which is
always a plus
onto my shampoo this is I like to change
up my shampoo and conditioner routine
quite often so this is the one that I've
been loving you know the past couple of
months but I have been obsessed with it
and I would really recommend it to you
guys so it is the big shampoo by lush I
live in Quebec so it's gonna be in
French but it's called big in English
and it's a really really really nice
shampoo so it looks like this inside I
know it looks kind of weird but it is a
sea salt scrub shampoo and what this
does is when you massage it into your
roots and scrapes off any dead skin
cells gets rid of all that but then the
moisture in it repairs all the dead skin
so it leaves your scalp really nice and
smooth what the chef's who also does is
it really gives you hair a lot of volume
so I mean I use it this morning and I
didn't choose my hair or any
and just even a really nice lift if I
wash my hair before bed and I wake up
the next morning I swear to God my hair
is like a lion's mane it's crazy it
gives so much volume so that's what I
really like about this shampoo I would
definitely recommend it especially if
you have a dry scalp because it really
helps with that on to my conditioner I
talked about this in my February
favourites so if you want to see that I
will link it down below in the
description but it's just the BB bumble
and bumble come to Koko conditioner and
I will either use this as a mask so I
will apply it throughout my whole hair
and leave it in for 20 minutes before
rinsing it out or I just like to use it
as my everyday conditioner I don't apply
just to the ends of my hair I normally
don't like to apply conditioner any of
our roots because if I do that it ways
my hair down and then takes away all the
natural oils and so it's really
moisturizing I find for the tips of my
hair it gives I have very dry hair so
this is perfect for me because it really
hydrates the ends and it doesn't make
them look as dead as they are and they
just feel really really really soft and
smooth and I really like that and also
it smells like coconut which is one of
my favorite scents so I'm obsessed with
this if only you guys could smell this
but definitely check this out I got it
at Sephora and then the next thing that
I use is my you know clear complexion
foaming cleanser and this is for acne
prone skin because I do get breakouts
sometimes and it's with salicylic acid
and moisture-rich Oh what is this
moisture rich soy extract and it helps
give a really nice clear and clean
complexion and what I really like about
this is that it comes out as a foam so
you just you know do one convert to
pumps and then you rub it in your
fingers and massage it all in your face
but you don't use that much product
because it does come out as a foam and
it's really gentle on your skin which I
really like because I'm not so into the
really harsh acne treatments they just
you know they break me out and they give
me a rash so this is perfect
I love Aveeno so that is nice and then I
just have a couple of like soundpool
sample of shampoos my bumble and bumble
that I got in Sephora you know you get
your points and stuff so this is just
the bumble and bumble straight shampoo I
kind of like this actually if you have
straight hair I would definitely
recommend it I do not but it still works
really well I mean it does give my hair
about like mmm look her if you know what
I mean like it like what makes it look
alive and then the last thing I have in
this rack is just my soap from lush it
is called karma and what I really like
about this soap is that it's very musky
smell and has a bit of amber in it and
it smells really nice so I like to use
this just as a regular soap for all over
my body and it really cleans up my skin
and it leaves a little bit of a residue
but it's nice it's really really subtle
so you don't need to worry about using
this any time of the day and then yeah
moving on to what we have down here so
yeah what we have down here is just my
sister's like face wash I guess and this
is by Neutrogena and it's just the
oil-free acne wash I don't really know
much about this cuz it's not mine but I
guess she likes it cuz she didn't buy
too long ago and it just makes your skin
really dry like don'twe okay so do not
buy this because it makes your skin very
dry and then I just have another one of
my vino clear complexion foaming
cleansers and this one's almost done
that's why I have another one up there
and then I just have my Sutton care dry
skin shower gel this is just you know
for shaving or whatnot and then my
sister shaver which she just uses uses
the intuition I guess that's kind of
good then moving on over here I have two
bath and Bodyworks
a bubble bath this one is the vanilla
bean Noel one and then then I just have
the Twilight woods this one is almost
done I
using these um I've actually used up all
my lush bath bombs and my bubble bath so
this is the stuff I turn to and I really
like it it really gets your bath nice
and foamy and then over here I have my
soft soap body butter coconut scrub and
it's just an exfoliator I like to use
this sometimes before I shave my legs or
anything like that or apply any fake tan
it just gets rid of all that dead skin I
have my sisters macadamia oil I don't
use this but it's really good for brown
hair and it is made with Moroccan oil
and argan oil so it does really make
your hair nice and smooth so I know she
loves this stuff so if you guys are
interested in that then you should check
it out so that is all that is in my
shower I hope you guys enjoyed this

away from your scalp my dogs
