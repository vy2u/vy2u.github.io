videos for a while or if you follow me
on snapchat what you should you will
know that I recently got an iPhone 6
because my other iPhone decided to just
stop working so you know cool let's
chill you know we had a love-hate
relationship so I moved on in minutes
it's been hard but I've moved on I got
so many requests and might get ready
video to make a iPhone 6 or what's on my
iPhone 6 video I made a what's on my
iPhone video maybe a year ago and how
like I edit my Instagram pictures and
stuff but I feel like every season
changes and what's on my iPhone now
compared to then is completely different
plus I have it completely laid out
differently this is my iPhone 6 I have a
screen protector that had a bubble in it
as soon as I put it on so super
frustrating but whatever are you gonna
do then my phone case is by free people
I got it when I was in New York City and
it's just a simple phone case I got the
iPhone 6 not the iPhone 6 plus the
regular iPhone 6 the white one with gold
in the back because I really like gold
better than silver for iPhones I guess
cuz I wear a lot of silver jewelry but I
don't know I'm weird I guess we'll just
get on into what's on my iPhone but
before I get started let's see if
looking at this video to 8,000 thumbs up
again that would be awesome you guys are
so good I love when you go and thumbs up
my video and it's really cool to see
like our different challenges and like
what we can get because I started off
just asking you for three thousand ones
and now we're all the way at eight
thousand and it's just crazy to me that
that many of you go and thumbs up my
videos I'm really happy so if you
haven't yet go do it right now
and let's get into it what's up guys so
here is my iPhone with a little bubble
in the middle of course because can't
put a screen protector on properly Alex
right right this is the case it's by
Free People and I'm actually obsessed
with it it's like a smooth rubber
consistency and I actually love it so
much I love the pattern of it I love the
colors everything about it it's super
awesome and the screen protector I just
got from Apple so the first thing you
will see on my phone oh my gosh okay
this is really bright there we go
I'm assuming you guys can see this so
it's a picture of Daniel and I
oh it's gone a picture of Daniel 9 I
took this like selfie on snapchat and I
posted it when I was in LA and I just
really liked it so that's my screen
saver if you open up my phone I just
have okay I have this weird thing where
I don't like putting apps on the bottom
row my friend used to do that and I've
just always done that so I don't know I
don't know why I do that the row right
here I have messages and phone calls
because those are the things I use the
most out of everything so the first page
I have my camera I have music I have
photos internet Facebook Twitter
Instagram snapchat tumblr
this is Spotify it's music if you guys
didn't know I actually don't have a
public Spotify account maybe I'll make
one let me know if I get a lot of light
thumbs up maybe I'll make mine public
then I have YouTube of course because I
love you guys
then Dropbox Gmail The Weather Network
then I have my calendar I have a
photography album right here because I'm
always it editing pictures for Instagram
then I have settings Google Maps RBC
which is my bank and uber on the first
page second page okay these albums are
quite random I don't really use them
that much I just have extras music
productivity and games
these ones I literally never use any of
the apps I don't even know what they're
like the apps that like you can't delete
from your phone like I use passbook when
I'm traveling but that's it then on my
games I have block which is so much fun
I'm obsessed with it and so I'm obsessed
with candy crush as well the soda crush
one then I have flow sudo COO solitaire
and face walk because face off is so
funny I always laugh so hard then under
those I have Airbnb which is actually a
really cool app because you can rent
homes and stuff when you're traveling
it's really cool I know Karina is using
it in Thailand right now if they got a
sick villa then PayPal because I use
that for business purposes I have
whatsapp because I have a lot of
contacts from around the world and it's
just you know easier to contact them
with this and then snaps what you guys
all know I love using that app just to
organize my closet and everything like
that so if you go back to the first page
my facebook is actually private but I do
have a public Facebook page which I will
link down below my twitter just got so
oh my gosh you guys I'm so sorry so my
twitter is miss Alexandra c1 I wish I
had Alex sent home oh but someone else
took it so this is my Twitter if you
guys want to follow me I'm sorry that's
so dark in the background it's just
because the screen is so light then if
you go back to my homepage I have
Instagram which you guys all know my
Instagram account you can follow me if
you wish this is my feed I just hit four
hundred thousand followers which is
awesome I'm so excited about that and
then snapchat is Alex and tomo if you
guys want to follow me
I love snapping I'm so excited to
snapchat in Greece you guys if you
follow me already you would have seen
those then photography what I use to
edit my pictures is square ready vsco
cam face tuned and Pixlr these ones I
like
never use ever I just haven't deleted
them as well as these two sometimes I'll
use insta size if you follow Karina on
Instagram you'll notice that her borders
on her pictures should actually have
another picture so she uses this app to
get that effect with vsco cam it's
really fun I've explained this before
but I'll just go through it again really
quickly so here's a picture here are the
filters you can use you can like bring
them down a ton if you don't want too
much filter you can bring it up you can
instead of doing that I usually go into
this part of the settings and what I'll
do first is go into temperature and I'll
bring that down a bit because I like it
more cool toned then I'll go into
highlights and I'll bring it up I kind
of just play around until I get
something that I really like and then I
will go into face tune and face tune is
really fun because you can do pretty
awesome things with it
so this picture already has a somewhat
blurry background but if you wanted to
you can actually go into D focus and you
can actually blur the background more so
if you take iPhone pictures and you want
a blurry background you can just like
make it blurry what's also cool about
this app is you can whiten so like I'll
weigh my teeth oh wait my shirt a bit
more my hair I'll make it a bit less
yellow if the you know the filter minute
yellow can just do a bunch of stuff like
that which is fun and then Pixlr the
only thing i use with Pixlr I go into
vibrance I bring it up just a bit
then I go into contrast bring up the
brightness just a bit to get it that
like faded look and then the last thing
I'll do is I'll go into effects subtle
and then I'll go all the way to the end
and I'll bring that down to like 20 or
13 whatever and I'll do that and then
what's really cool is that you can
actually edit your pictures on Instagram
now which i think is amazing and so
smart because you can just do like final
touches I love that about Instagram so
yeah this is everything that's on my new
phone if you have any suggestions for
other apps you think I'd like let me
know in the comments down below because
I love checking on you apps and if you
like my phone is quite boring cuz I just
got a new phone and it's pretty
organized it's how I like but yeah I
would like to know more so I hope you
enjoyed that video please let me know in
the comments down below if you try out
different apps if you think I like
certain apps I'm just curious to know
what you guys think and again don't
forget to give this video a big thumbs
up it means a lot to me and subscribe
for more and I will see you all in my
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
