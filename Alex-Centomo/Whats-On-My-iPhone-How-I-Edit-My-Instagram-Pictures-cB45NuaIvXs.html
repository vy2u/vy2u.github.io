I edit my Instagram pictures and also
kind of like what's on my iPhone this
has been my most requested video so I
decided to film it for you guys and I
thought it'd be interesting because I
get a lot of questions on how I edit my
picture so yeah we'll just show you
right now so on the first page of my
iPhone I just have a camera music photo
safari Facebook Twitter Instagram
snapchat tumblr 8tracks YouTube uber
Dropbox Mayo gmail weather and then I
have my photography folder and these are
my like most used apps on a daily basis
also I have text and phone on the bottom
I like to keep a space here I don't know
why I think one of my friends used to do
that and I just started because I
thought it'd look cool as you can see my
phone's pretty boring on this side I
have new sandwich I never use I don't
even know if it is then I just have a
thing here called real apps which the
only thing I use in here is my settings
feature and the Google Maps and then I
have my utilities which the only thing I
use again is the clock to set my alarms
and stuff then I have social which I
don't use so I should probably lead that
stuff then games here I have plants vs.
zombies to Sudoku solitaire flow free I
used to be obsessed with then I have
candy crush blocks mini and run subway
surf and mega run so the only things I
really use our candy crush because I
just really like it and I use what I'll
use now subway surf sometimes and sodoku
the other ones I don't really use much
oh by the way - this picture of a wolf
if it was my background so I just
thought it was really cool and I love
wolves and then random is rotten and I
just don't use it for my Instagram I get
so many questions how I edit my pictures
so this is my Instagram you can follow
me it
Alex sent home oh it's just simple I
have all my pictures like this lately
I've been doing a lot of tumblr style
pictures oh this is Karina you can go
follow her to her thing is Karina
underscore underscore V I don't know I
just I've been really into like tumblr
lately and I think that I've been
getting inspired by a lot of the
pictures taken there so as you can see I
have like my American Horror Story
coming into picture just like the
classic tumblr picture huh I have a lot
of my brand new pictures around here oh
here's another like tumbler one I got my
mom to do this on my hair because I
couldn't do a fishtail braid from the
back so I had to ask her to do it that
was weird
and then oh and this is Catherine if you
want to follow her it's Kath underscore
Belle it's actually cat Belle but
there's an H so you want to follow her
and then that's my sister Carlos into
Elmo what's tumblr oh my god this this
actually got a lot of hype on tumblr I
got so many reblogs and stuff and I just
really liked it my mom again took this
picture it was pretty funny how these
stockings are from Urban Outfitters and
so is my sweater and I just thought it
was really cool it was my knee of like a
ballerina and I just really liked it and
then this picture here his super famous
on tumblr there's like 50000 reblogs or
whatever and it's a little frustrating
because a lot of celebrities are taking
this picture and posting it and
pretending it's them like Ashley Tisdale
post this on her official and SAAM no
official Facebook page and pretended it
was her and it's funny because since I
don't have any like watermarks or
anything anyone could just take this and
post it as them but I swear this is me
that's my living room my boyfriend took
this picture and it sucks a few notes in
my face but for proof here look I took
this picture yesterday
and it's in the same exact spot so yeah
that's that okay now how I edit my
pictures I'll just go into this
photography app so my most used apps for
Instagram editing pictures and stuff is
Pixlr Express Plus after light-square
ready vsco cam characters pic frame
facetune Snapseed and lumi the ones i
use most or probably Pixlr Express plus
and vsco cam and then square ready I'll
use after light once in a while but not
as much so normally how I start it's
always different for every picture but
like let's just see okay so go just go
into my pictures here I'll just grab
what words it where's the one I had it
did here okay so this is the picture
that I posted on my Instagram just
yesterday so the first thing I'll do is
sometimes if I want I'll like crop it
into a square first just to see how it
would fit on Instagram but see this one
I don't really like how my body is kind
of like half hidden when I put into a
square so I just won't do that the thing
I'll normally do first this will go into
here contrast and the first thing I'll
do is probably like brightness and I'll
brighten it up just a little bit not too
much usually around like 2 or 1 or 3 and
then I'll go into contrast and I'll go
up a little bit brightness I kind of
just play around with it until it's like
something that I kind of like so just
keep up that and then I'll save that
sometimes I'll go in and sharpen it a
little bit but this is just kind of like
what I do first and then sometimes I'll
go into filters and what I like about
this is that you can take filters like
let's say this one is probably my most
use for winter and then you go into here
and you can like adjust how much filter
you want
so like see that I don't like but if I
were to bring it down I kind of like
that because it kind of gives it a bit
of like color and something a bit
different so that I'll save and another
feature on Pixlr Express lately like -
haven't used in a while but they have
these like
under light effects so here you can post
that there and then you can switch size
you can put it upside down or the right
side and then again you can adjust how
much you want shown so I realize that we
use this a lot in this summer to edit
pictures but for this I think I'm just
going to keep it simple and like that so
then I'll save it so once that's saved
I'll go into vsco cam and then I'll pull
up the picture see these are all like
the previous pictures I've added before
I'll pull up the picture these are
pictures of me from when I was a kid
sometimes I say the fly won't fit but
just press the question the checkmark
and I'll be fine
then I'll go into edit and um they show
you filters at first but I actually like
to use this feature which is like the
exposure I'll make a brighter you can
kind of adjust that and then if you want
I like to use faded sometimes which
makes it like a really like faded green
you kind of look which is pretty popular
on Instagram and Tumblr I know a lot of
famous youtubers use this feature
sometimes if it's like two feet alone to
contrast and make it a bit darker or
I'll go the opposite way and make you
even more faded let's just say that and
then normally I'll keep this how it is
and save it but for the sake of this
video I'll show you how you can use the
filters so like let's say I want to make
it black and white I can choose this
there's a bunch of different options and
then you can also kind of change the
filter around and see if you like
something different um so this is like I
don't really want that so let's put that
down my most used ones are normally T
one and I think G 3 or C 1 but I rarely
use this only for like stern style
pictures like this one I really like T 1
and I think it's really nice putting
that down a little bit make it pretty
artsy and stuff and then I'll just save
that see
safety camera roll and then sometimes
alone to after light and the only things
I really use on after light I like will
adjust the clarity so if you want to be
more sharp or you can bring it down put
it high or whatever sometimes I'll use
like contrast or whatever but I mean I
already use that so I don't need to use
it for now and then further filters I
really like coral and especially for
like pictures that I have a very white
background I think it's really nice and
I just really like it and then another
cool feature about after light is that I
think it's an excellent 99 cents or
whatever but you can actually put your
picture into like a Polaroid so here
it'll kind of look like that and or you
can do it this way I know there's a
bunch of different ways you could do it
and I really like it so that's another
feature that is cool about this once
that picture is saved I will go into
square ready which makes the white
borders on photos so that you can put it
on Instagram and not have like you can
put the full picture so here I'll show
you so I'll take that one and see that's
okay like if you want to keep it with a
square that's why I mean that looks
really good but I really like it when it
shows more so that will just make create
bigger white borders but what's good
about a picture is that you can actually
move the picture around to how you want
it so like let's say I find the borders
too big I can actually just pull it in
and I'll still have white borders but
they won't be as big on the top and
bottom so that it won't look too I don't
explain it like wide or small the
picture that you can see more detail so
that up being too cropped or you can do
it the whole Kendall Kylie Jenner thing
and make it like a white border all
around and then have your picture in the
center there are some youtubers that
like to do that as well and then just
save it I will just go up here camera
rule and I usually do JPEG to four four
eight times two four four eight I don't
know why someone showed me that and I
just started doing that from
then on with other apps characters is a
really good one I get a lot of questions
on how I do my symbols so this one
allows you to have like a symbol like
this with a moon in the star it allows
you to do like those open hearts you can
do a bunch of different symbols that
with this I really really like it and
yeah sometimes I'll just like do flowers
or whatever and a bunch of different
things it's really fun pic frame is just
to make like collages or whatever but
sometimes I like to like put two
pictures side by side then you can like
mirror them and stuff but I haven't
actually used this in a long time then
phase tuned this one's cool if you want
to get rid of zits so here it will just
here try a sample photo so this person I
don't know that this is but all you have
to do is click smooth and you just kind
of smooth over the face and I mean if
you really smooth it a lot you'll kind
of look like a china doll but you can
really like get rid of any like wrinkles
harsh lines pimples it just smooths
everything out and makes it look really
pretty don't know who you are but nice
base snap see it's a really good one
because I have a lot of pictures that I
take against a white wall but because of
shadows sometimes one side the wall will
be darker than the other so here as an
example I'll just pull up a picture
really quickly okay so let's just say
this this is Kareena by the way um so to
use and then well of course this one's
not that obvious but this side is like
way brighter in person on this side so
what I like to do is then I'll just wow
it's showing so overexposed in this
video I promise you it's not like that
person you just click this little button
you add your little marks and once you
go cross the screen you can bring in one
side and then add
another so you can make them even on
both sides and then you can adjust like
how big you want it you can go this way
or you can darken it and go like that
you can move them around and stuff so I
just thought that was really really
convenient for someone who does like
using white backgrounds and then Lumi
just creates those really pretty things
in the background so like a little like
watermarks and stuff
this obviously squish my picture but you
would want to put something of square
you can like rotate in adjust the
exposure and stuff there's a bunch of
things you can do I thought it's really
pretty and then the next page honestly
like I rarely use these apps so like I
don't really think I'm gonna explain
them because some of them I just
downloaded it just see as like a trial
and then I never use them and I should
probably delete them I'll never use the
Instagram filters just because I really
like editing myself and it's always
different each time like I'll play
around with a bunch of different things
and like get what I like and then
another point actually I got to show you
guys is pic collage a lot a lot of
youtubers use this one so here this you
can just make it able to change
background so let's have like a simple
white background
and so here you could just tap on the
thing add photo and you can like create
collages you could post little pictures
you could post quotes and do a bunch of
different things switch it around make a
bunch of different things and sometimes
I'll use this it's really fun actually
to make something artsy and I'll post
this once in a while but for the most
part I'll just kind of do the ones I
showed you and then I'll post it to my
Instagram yeah that's how I edit them
normally I'll just use my camera it's a
county flyby that's about it so if you
want to follow me on instagram it's alex
and tomo sorry if this is kind of like
out of focus and bit shaky it's really
hard to film this but I hope you guys
are having an awesome day if you want
more detail or have more questions feel
