if you don't know who she is you should
because she's melanie audrey the
bracelet company that i always promote
because i love it so much she's actually
the creator behind it and she makes all
the bracelets basically I asked her to
be in one of my videos because I love
being with her just in general so
basically today I thought it'd be a good
idea to film a winter essentials video
because um might not be like this where
you are from but we're we're from it's
like a blizzard outside yeah literally a
blizzard we wish you we can show you
because it looks like an ice cube yeah
go watch my bawdy Channel and you'll see
or maybe her vlogging Channel soon soon
okay so we're gonna go I guess like one
by one kind of showing our winter
essentials things that we absolutely
need in winter time just like comfy
stuff and just yeah what we think is
perfect for the winter if you live in a
cold climate if you look hot climate I'm
jealous
okay go okay we're gonna start with some
fuzzy stuff I got for Christmas thank
you mother because I'm sure you'll be
watching this video this is actually
from pink from Victoria's Secret it's a
robe had a bear a I'm soft yeah it's
super soft and I work at home I have a
home office and the office gets really
cold especially in the winter so this
has come really in handy and I just
bundle myself up in this and
I love it you isn't long it's them I
would say about me lengths servers a lot
first thing for me would have to be
scarves I love scarves especially big
thick plots cards that you can basically
where it's blanket so I've showed this
one before but this one is just for made
well it's super thick and comfy and I
kind of need to wear a scarf when I go
outside in this weather because it's
breathing so any scarf that's like cute
and chunky is just like my thing and I
just put a bundle you up yeah I plus
when you put perfume on it just smell
really good and every time I put it on
I'm like mm-hmm
let's talk about blush yeah I guess
we're not endorsing things in any way
this is actually just for fun and to
show you what we honestly yeah exactly
need for not faltered but blush if you
want to sponsor this hey we're here so I
tried out so many different products
during the winter and unfortunately when
it comes to this very harsh winter I
have very dry skin and I tried so many
things and lush seems to be the only
thing that's working so far so I ended
up getting this really cool cleanser
it's an all-in-one cleanser so it'll
take off your makeup and anything else
you got on your face and it's got
beeswax and it's a beeswax and rose
cream cleanser just soften and
thoroughly clean the skin it smells
divine but
I don't know it's got like yeah it
smells like not it's sweet honey for two
reasons and what I love about it is
there's there's got like God that's not
fun but like little grainy yeah it's
like a little grainy so you can feel
like you're like exfoliating some and
then I've got aloe vera soothing rose
and clarifying herbs expertly blend it
to smooth balance skin so this I would
do is just like a toner or what this is
a toner so it takes off this I actually
don't use any water to clean my face
which is what really cool huh so I use
this to cleanse and then this to take
this off it's really cool and the best
part is after I use that toner the cream
I put on this cream that has nourishing
wheatgrass seaweed and vanilla and this
actually smells like a cake although
people would disagree with me but it
smells really good this literally smells
of
that's inappropriate it does not smell
like a cake but I can see how she could
think it smells like a cake that's like
it has at least in vanilla know which is
me it smells like vanilla pudding okay I
can't take that
but like kind of like but what I
actually really like about love about
lush is they don't test on animals which
if you're really an advocate for that
militias the perfect product is I love
lush sucks with the end of all honestly
if you go and you get a headache door
remote it cuz it helps everyone yeah
just go away it'll go okay so I guess
I'll go along with the skincare stuff so
I got this from Sephora the other day
it's the Kate Somerville just
moisturizer it's a daily moisturizer it
honestly it's pretty thick but doesn't
break me out and it gets rid of all my
dryness but you need to make sure that
you exfoliate because if you don't have
to believe that there's you no point of
even moisturizing your face I don't know
I find this break me out at least my
face super moisturized and fresh feeling
and it just feels like a baby's butt
okay a lot of you have seen Mia's little
balls of joy well if you didn't know I
was just tossed her gum on the floor I
did it didn't happened she's lying okay
balls of joy these things I got these in
stockings not so good you can get them
and you can get them at a pharmacy or
you can get them at Costco and a pack
for those I don't know privacy the
drugstore
I've got pharmaceutical at Kaiser so
yeah this is the Aussie of us us we
don't really know but they're really
good and perfect for harsh winters and
guys seem pretty much expendable
like my boyfriend uses this I he's
always like oh that thing looks so weird
by blood really lip balm and I'm like oh
you wanna use my lip balm now huh it's
like this one's a minty flavor so
actually kind of like tingles on your
lips at first when you put it on it
feels really good yeah this one smells
like amazing that one used to be my
favorite and then now it's this one for
the wintertime
what next for me would have to be fuzzy
socks gum on the floor socks on the
floor every on the floor my life is a
mess basically fuzzy socks these are
just like the long ones that I have cuz
all the other rights are in the wash
because I wear them all the time so
these ones are kind of a mix between the
two socks I want to show you which were
basically thigh-high socks which are
definitely a winter essential for me
because they keep your legs warm you can
wear them with cute like big sweaters
which is like my style I love it I'm
tights underneath so when it gets really
cold and these ones are just fuzzy socks
that are super long and I love wearing
them inside and all my hands like this
cuz I think it looks really cute and
plus I could do this and it just I like
it
okay so yeah that's my next winter
sexual essential Sox only edition this
stuff hey one more sorry where were
those fun these are boyfriend's oh these
ones this is from American Apparel the
long lines they're really long though so
I kind of had to pack a bunch of them at
the ankles but whatever and then these
ones are from Target and then these ones
are actually my boyfriend's brother
socks
sorry to him I have your socks after
watching this would you probably aren't
but I had your socks because I stole
them cause they're really comfortable
and if you have a boyfriend then just
take a socks and if you don't have a
boyfriend then go to your friend's house
and go to their boyfriends drawer and
take their songs I don't know I think
these are American Apparel to be honest
but I would just buy some boy socks
I love boys are who you know who has a
really good sauce is Bruce really just
like that really yes
they have like that heathery they're
probably way cheaper than urban
outfitters in Mexico
probably this one I got it's actually a
cape and I got this I know it sounds
kind of funny okay I got this at Topshop
at the bay and
Tagg it's the coolest thing it's really
cool it's a little bit more fashionable
if you want to keep warm and still look
good at the same time but yeah it's at
this smells really good yeah would you
spray on it oh my god
it's your perfume that always smells so
good welcome every time should I be in
bed like he asked the cool thing about
this cave is you can actually just like
get get up yeah that's really cute and
they have other colors too of them
they've got two colors this is obviously
the black array where the most each you
walk in basic and basic and they've got
a reddish plaid color too which is cute
last thing for me will be sweaters
immediately you guys I don't know if you
know but like I really love sweaters you
probably don't know if I can never talk
about this ever
no and I never show this on my strap but
I love sweaters so I think the first one
I want to show you is this sweater that
I've never shown before but is this one
for Free People
it's just distressed and it's really
comfy and warm it's super soft I don't
know how to explain it it's just like
it's like I don't know it's just baggy
and I love it and it looks like I got
into some kind of like fight but like
that's cool right because who doesn't
like each other getting an insight are
not cool
don't do it No so there's that one then
there's this one that's kind of like a
turtleneck sweater ish and it's from
brandy and it's just like yeah it's kind
of cropped ish
then there's this like kind of journal
like anyways the half turn away yeah
exactly exactly it kind of hides the
double chins but like not too much
because alex has several chance right
it's just any kind of sweater that looks
like a pajama top this one is from Jack
Vinick it's freakin awesome it's perfect
for like lounging in and looking cute
you could pair it with anything you can
even wear it out but I love wearing this
at home on the weekends it's perfect
feel it it's just like oh yeah baby
I just like it it's really nice exactly
great I have a couple of people to thank
for the following so I went to Toronto
and my feet were so freezing and one of
my friends apartment and I found these
really cool I didn't know at the time
but they were slippers and they are
giant robot slippers mark mark if you're
watching this thank you
those are amazing and Dad thank you for
gaming for me you can get them on a sink
geek calm and they are ingenious and the
best part is they make noise okay yes
every time you walk it's like a robot
noise so you can it you can walk really
slowly and actually act like a robot
it's pretty awesome I mean who does more
robots the first right my last winter
essential will have to be her bracelets
is actually do wear them all the time
but they're not just like winter
essential they're kind of like essential
for all
seasons okay then everywhere in the
world because her bracelets are
basically all about travel I've
explained this before in many videos but
if you didn't know every single one of
her bracelets is based off a person that
she's met and has inspired her in some
kind of way and she usually writes a
little story that goes along with the
bracelet and it's just like such a
wonderful idea and she traveled a lot so
she met a bunch of really cool people
when she travels and that's kind of what
got her like inspired to do it right I'm
really inspired by wanderlust and seeing
the world but definitely I'm inspired by
the people around me so I started I
started the company a little over a year
ago and I think no I'm up to maybe 70
people that's amazing which is cool yeah
and the cool guys just look at the
packaging of this so the first one that
she just dropped up for me is this one
which is like this is I think my
favorite I think so my favorite and I
just really love the nautical theme of
it I just I don't know even though it's
not like winter seems she has winter
stuff too
but like this I know I could wear this
like look at the colors it just goes
it's so much fun and that one is the
goal freshening flow of track the other
one is this one it's so beautiful
because I love turquoise and of course
this one has turquoise in it plus the
hogs and the brown movies cool picture
jasper picture jasper which is my
favorite ever and these are really cool
because i got some weight to them you
know they're kind of a little heavy yeah
this is all real lasting yeah can I
yeah wait you wanna show yours yeah I'm
actually wearing a stack of the euro
Globetrotter so it's actually got it's
got brown obsidian in it and some
beautiful pink coral oh so nice so I
actually love wearing them all winter oh
yeah they would remind me of tropical
exactly and warmer days that's what like
I are like wearing that's what I like
about them it's like when I wear them
especially in the colder months it just
makes me like excited for summer because
sometimes you just need that in your
life when it's like minus 30 outside and
you're depressed because the weather is
horrible it's so cold so she made one
inspired by me it's called the mermaid
what is it the mermaid it's called the
free spirit mermaid free spirit mermaid
and I've shown it so many times I'll get
it this is it it's like a basically a
wrap bracelet and it's all my favorite
colors combined into one and she did I
think you said like mermaid cause of my
mermaid hair yeah yes she reminds me of
the mermaid so basically this is it I
love it and I do wear this cretin
it goes with many outfits actually I
find like it just kind of like a little
subtle piece that some people see in
they're like wait what is that
and then they always like lift up my
sleeve and they're like oh that's really
nice where'd you get that like Melanie
