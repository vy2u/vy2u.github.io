channel I don't know why I clap every
time I do this I'm so awkward when I
started videos I finally got around to
filming my winter lookbook you could say
so before we into this video I quickly
wanted to give a little disclaimer I was
in Canada it's very very cold here but
it's very beautiful so for this video I
just decided that I obviously wanted to
show you guys my outfit and what I would
wear typically on like an everyday basis
but I wouldn't wear these outfits like
this outside obviously I'd wear my super
warm winter jacket but I have one and if
I just showed you guys the same winter
jacket in like five different outfits
you wouldn't see anything because it's
literally like the blanket that you come
over yourself and it covers your whole
outfit if you're from a cold climate you
know what kind of jacket I'm talking
about because it's the only thing that
will keep you warm in -40 weather that
being said I don't want any comments
being like was growth crazy I would
never wear that outside this is not what
I would wear outside I just filled it
outside because it's pretty and it took
me like a minute to film each outfit so
it wasn't long so I wasn't freezing to
death I mean it was cold but I get it
for the video I did it for like the
pretty scenery so if you guys see any of
those comments please just let them know
to watch this part of the video because
a lot of people just skip forward and
then they have comments and I wish I
didn't even have to make this disclaimer
but I just know this is going to happen
because every time I post on Instagram
we're wearing a sweater outside and it's
snowing I get so many comments like that
and it's like obviously this is not what
I wear what I'm actually outside doing
things that being said let's just get
into this video I hope you guys enjoy it
and yeah
you
six days and seven ends in the street
and calm
young love really meant to make me feel
this all they come realize all that we
have to realize now it'll never come
back we'll see how surprising winter is
that it has grown so cold don't you ever
say this won't be the last time we'll
see how my winters
I lost my license when I look into your
eyes I lost all my face when I were
through the life prophet has not spoken
old curtain must now fall there's a
final chapter the ending of it all the
young person winter
oh is canon arms grow so cold
don't you ever sing this won't be the
last time see how the buzz is winter Oh
we come to the comb
I'm bringing with it the heartbreak at
all Oh
