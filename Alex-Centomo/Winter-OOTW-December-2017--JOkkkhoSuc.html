channel I'm just chilling on the floor
with my big teddy bear and Boo is on his
lap right now she's so cute so a lot of
you guys have been asking me lately to
film a holiday gift guide or talk about
what I want for the holidays or what I
would recommend getting people for the
holidays and when I was younger all I
ever wanted was clothing let's like the
only thing I would ask for so I decided
to film a outfit of the week video
showing you some of my favorite outfits
to wear for the holiday season and also
give you ideas if you guys want to
purchase any of these outfits to give to
your friends or family it for this time
of year I just thought it would be a
little helpful also a huge thank you to
Urban Outfitters for partnering with me
on this video Urban Outfitters is
definitely my top store for any kind of
shopping in general but especially for
the holidays because it is kind of a
one-stop shop it has like clothing
accessories home decor personalized
things like picture frames you can get
anything to do with music I just think
it's like perfect all around for any
kind of shopping yeah hopefully this can
inspire you for any presents you need to
get for this time of year and also let
me know which outfit was your favorite
down below in the comments and while
you're down there make sure to subscribe
to my channel if you're not already and
also turn off a little foul
notifications so that you guys are
notified when my videos go live and also
give this video a thumbs up if you guys
like these types of videos if you want
me to do more for all the other seasons
and without further ado let's just get
into the video
Monday's are always a sad day so let's
turn the sadness into something positive
with a really cute pick-me-up outfit I
love this because it's warm it's cozy
but it's also really fashionable I love
these corduroy jeans there are a
three-quarter cut Jean and I know my
boots seem a little impractical but they
are so comfortable I can walk around for
hours in these it just completes the
outfit totally everything is from Urban
Outfitters and I'm upset
also I decided to throw on this leather
jacket to switch up the look so taking
off the hat the cardigan and the scarf
completely changes everything about this
look makes it more edgy if that's more
your style I thought this would be
perfect Plus this jacket is so warm
Tuesday was so snowy oh my gosh but
honestly it's so beautiful I always love
to take go out and walks when it's this
kind of weather cuz he gets so excited
this sweater is probably my new favorite
I think I'm gonna wear it to New Year's
I thought it was the perfect mix between
comfy and sparkly something that's
exactly my style for New Year's and
Urban Outfitters hit it right on the
nail with this I love it it's so soft
but gives off a really snowy sparkly
vibe and then I just wore it with
leggings and my timberlands from urban
as well this is probably the warmest
outfit out of everything just because of
the coat and the scarf the coat from
urban is actually reversible and I think
it's awesome because you can have the
Christmasy green color on one side and
on the other side it's actually black
and then obviously wearing it with my
Tim's and these jeans are so comfortable
from urban they're bdg and they're
stretchy but tight so they feel really
comfortable and then this sweater is
that Chanel material it's so soft and I
am just so cozy wearing this
I always loved Thursday because it's the
day before Friday which was the day
before the weekend and I always felt
really excited on this day so I really
like this scarf color paired with the
sweater I thought the combination was
really nice and then again wearing the
same jeans from B D G and the Tim's as
well the knit actually can be worn as a
sweater dress which was really cool I
thought it would be really cute for a
Christmas party or something it also
would be a really great gift for
somebody because this color actually
goes really well with any skin tone and
any hair color Friday is freaky Freaky
Friday get it these pens are definitely
out there for me but I love them and I
think they're perfect for the holidays I
think they'd be such a cute Christmas
gift they're so comfy and they fit so
well and I think I'm gonna be rocking
these all winter especially with a super
fuzzy mock neck sweater it is the
softest thing it feels like I'm wearing
a cloud I just love this outfit I feel
like Santa and of course I will make
sure to have everything listed down
below for you guys so you can check it
out for yourselves
Saturday's pretty casual this is a
Chanel cardigan which is the same
material as that other pink sweater and
it's so soft and I love this grandfather
hat it just reminds me of my actual Papa
and that makes me so happy as well as
the necklaces again the same mom jeans
and I'm wearing these super cute and
cozy slippers they are these softest
things and I just feel so festive and
happy and I really hope you guys enjoyed
it hold up guys let me just quickly say
something cuz I know I'm gonna get a lot
of comments about this where I live it's
very very cold and I'm aware that you
could not wear these outfits in the snow
itself you need to layer up but these
are outfits you could wear definitely
underneath you're super super warm
winter jacket if you live in a place
where it gets to below zero like where I
live it goes to like my knee it's the
minus forty five sometimes with the wind
it's so cold so obviously I'm not gonna
be showing a video of what you can wear
outside during that time because all it
is is my super warm winter jacket with
that being said just picture you wearing
it this stuff under that jacket so hope
you guys enjoyed the video again a huge
thank you to Urban Outfitters for
partnering with me for this I am so
excited about it
urban has been my HOF store for years
and years and years just because it has
everything I hope these outfits inspired
you let me know what you guys are gonna
get for the holidays or what you're
asking for the holidays I love you guys
