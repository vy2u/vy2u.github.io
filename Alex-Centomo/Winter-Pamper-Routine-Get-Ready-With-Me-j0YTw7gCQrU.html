cold winter months is sick Alex lazy
Alex dry skin Alex just mopey not in a
good mood
24/7 Alex because it's so dark outside
and gloomy and you know having that 24/7
it's a little bit in but once a week
I've been doing this like pamper routine
that's kind of I don't know it just
makes me feel a lot more relaxed and
stuff and I usually do it at night but I
actually film this during a day because
the lighting is better I'd love to like
go to my grandma's house cuz she has
this huge bathtub and just like soak in
the tub and just do all these things and
I've spoken about it a lot in my
blogging channel because I did blog miss
this year so I'll have that linked down
below if you guys are curious to see but
I always talked about my pamper routine
and so many of you guys want to see it
and I figured this is something more for
my main channel because I don't know
maybe you guys aren't just into seeing
what I do to relax so if you are then
just keep on watching and let's get into
the video because these months are so
cold my scalp actually gets very dry and
itchy all the time so I picked up this
call it's called a magic elixir and it's
from it heals and I've used it a few
times now it's actually pretty good so
what I do is I put it all over my roots
and just massage it into my head and I
let it sit there for around 20 minutes
to half an hour before I get into the
shower and before you wash your hair and
this just helps kind of like moisturize
your scalp leaving it very refreshed and
like not dry and not itchy it actually
helps a lot and usually while I wait for
that to soak in I play with my dogs or
in this case I was at my grandma's house
so my grandma's dog and my uncle's dog
and they just attacked me so much and
they're so cute this I was stuck to wash
my hair recently I've been using this
shampoo and conditioner and then for my
face I decided to exfoliate today so
this is the product that I was using to
exfoliate and I don't know I just find
that exfoliating once a week is very
important in the winter because my skin
especially gets very dry and very flaky
it's gross so if I don't exfoliate it
just tends to build up on my face
creating acne because dry skin does
cause acne and that's something I
learned recently
and yeah after my shower I feel really
refreshed I actually don't wash my body
in the shower when I do this because I'm
going to take a bath later onto my hair
now when I dry my hair I've actually
been using this new towels by the brand
called akise and it's actually made for
drying your hair so it's very
lightweight it's not like a bath towel
it actually helps dry your hair really
fast without damaging it because your
hair is very fragile when it is wet so
it doesn't pull on your hair it doesn't
drag it down it just dries it very
quickly very gently and you actually
don't need to rub your hair when you dry
it and then I just put it up in a turban
because Lord Baltimore oh and fYI I will
have a discount code for that towel so
I'll have it listed down in the
description below for you guys and then
I like to move on to a face mask so any
type of face mask that you are loving at
the moment is perfect but I like to do
this while I'm sitting in the bath and
just let it soak on my face and I love
the feeling of this charcoal one from
origins and then I start to run the bath
and I'm using two lush products today so
the first one is a bubble bar on a stick
kind of thing it's really awesome but I
had never used this before and it
created so many bubbles it was actually
crazy but so much fun my grandma's
bathtub is so awesome
and then I'm just dropping the eggnog or
yagna whatever it's called bath bomb
into the bath to give it a really nice
smell especially the smell because it
smells so good and yeah then I just like
to sit in the tub and play with the
bubbles normally I'll go on my phone but
for the purpose of this video I want to
show off the amazing bubbles that this
bolívar created because it was so much
fun once I get out of the bath and rinse
my face I use a toner this one is from
Kota Lee and there are so many benefits
towards a toner I'm not an expert but
I've just been told a million times from
so many experts like legit experts that
this is very important when doing a face
routine and then I go in with a serum
this is from Kiehl's it's really good
for anti-aging and all that kind of
stuff
I find it feels amazing - it was pricey
and so was this product which is like
the midnight oil so I do use this a lot
for my pamper routine because I just
feel very good and relaxed
after that then I take down my hair and
as you could see my hair has dried
significantly with just that towel I
didn't even have to rub my hair or
anything all the water came out and it's
you know not damaged then I like to
moisturize so this is just when I picked
up from Body Works it smells really
really good moisturizing is so important
especially during the winter months so
that's what I've been doing almost every
single day so I hope you guys enjoyed
this video if you liked this video or
found anything useful or helpful then
give this video a big thumbs up because
that makes me super happy to see that
and also let me know in the comments
what you guys do to relax or if you have
any product recommendations because I'm
going through a phase where I'm trying
out so many different products and I
just really like experimenting and
seeing how things react with my skin and
learning about my skin and learning that
you know like products have a lot of
chemicals in them aren't that great for
me anyways don't forget to subscribe
I'll have a link listed down below for
you guys and I love you all so much and
I will see you all bye scalp is feeling
real good right now real good yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
