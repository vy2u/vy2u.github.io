my channel I feel like I'm so old school
right now like old school YouTube videos
I'm sitting on my bed with a pile of
clothes
my little toothless stuffy and I'm
filming on my vlog camera today that is
just because I felt like it so why not
right I like could make a really fancy
video with my fancy camera but I just
really didn't feel like setting it up so
this camera works totally fine I have no
issues with this and with this way I
feel like we're kind of just chilling
together on my bed and I'm showing you
what I just bought
I love videos like this I just feel like
they're a lot more personal I don't know
so this is not gonna be very edible if--
back here in my hair cool this is gonna
be a try on haul I know so many of you
guys get so mad at me when I don't you
try on hauls I'm so sorry guys it's just
that sometimes I don't have much time to
film and edit so those are very time
consuming because filming your outfits
believe it or not like changing into
everything takes a long time but don't
worry this video is going to be a try on
haul so I recently went shopping
obviously you guys know the drill and I
picked up a few fun things but the other
fun thing with this video is that there
is going to be a giveaway at the end a
huge holiday giveaway worth $500 so stay
tuned to the end till the end to the end
stay tuned to see how you can enter that
giveaway and I will talk about it later
please don't skip through let me go
you guys know my obsession with sweaters
in particular great sweaters well you
know that obsession is still there it's
strong I did get a few gray sweaters I
have no regrets and I am not apologizing
for it I love gray sweater so much so
I'm gonna go through everything by Brent
I guess because what makes the most
sense let's start off with a sews
because ASOS is at the top of my pile
over here is it a sauce or a sauce I
always ask people this I literally just
posted a vlog yesterday asking you guys
if you're from the UK how do you
pronounce it because I'm pretty sure
ASOS a sauce is a UK website yeah so I
don't
I don't know how to pronounce it I got
three things from a sauce I'm just gonna
say ASOS cuz that's what I watch a lot
of American youtubers and that's how
they say it so I got three things at
ASOS but I didn't like one of the things
so I actually packaged it I'm gonna be
returning it soon so I'm not gonna
bother showing you but the two other
things I love I'm going to show you
first thing being this pair of jeans I
see these jeans literally everywhere so
my friend Kat introduced me to them she
had the black pair in new york so i got
like the black-ish gray pair but then i
saw the blue pair on her and i think
Tess has them too and my cousin
Christina I'm just like oh my god
they're so nice so they're just skinny
high-waisted jeans with rips in the
knees the rips are really distressed and
they're really big so it's actually
super flattering and I like them because
they're pretty skinny and the pockets on
the but are super-nice and these are
extremely high waisted so they go over
your bellybutton like it's crazy how
highway says they are and then the
bottoms I just rolled them up a little
bit so they're kind of like halfway down
my calf and then I wear them with those
high booties that like go up your calf I
think it's so nice the next I always say
the next thing really annoying this
thing that I got from ASOS is this
shearling jacket this is gonna be
impossible to show you just like this so
doriel instead of clip but it's a brown
oversized ish shearling jacket it's not
real it was pretty affordable it was
also on sale that's why I got it yeah I
really love this I'm known for owning
like always oversized denim oversized
bombers or like legit winter jackets I
don't and I don't own anything really
nice to wear to like a nice dinner or
something or that's fashionable so I
thought this would be perfect plus I
have been eyeing it for a while and then
it was on sale and I was like this is a
sign I then went to H&amp;amp;M and I got three
I know that's a why I got two items two
sweaters but one of them is in the wash
right now so I'm not gonna bother
showing you and then the second thing I
got is one of my new favorite things ah
an oversized turtleneck grey knit with
that like what material is this can you
see this it's like this fuzzy kind of
honestly have no idea how to explain
that but this is very oversized like it
covers your butt so it's perfect to wear
with leggings and boonies they have
soldiers like this on acne studio so you
guys know acne it's a designer brand
that's very expensive and I'm just like
obsessed with their sweaters but
obviously I'm not gonna be spending like
$500 for sweater so can afford me that
H&amp;amp;M had very very similar looking
sweaters and they have the same material
so why not right then I did some damage
on Windsor this lighting what I if
you're getting blinded I'm sorry I'm I
don't even know what to do like Windsor
is that type of store that is just so
perfect for any kind of thing you need
to complete an outfit mind you they have
really good basics as well with really
good dresses I typically don't really
wear dresses but I love going to them
for any kind of accessory or like piece
to complete an outfit so for example
this tank top thank you thank you Alex
it's a black tank top it's loose I think
this would be so pretty tucked into
those blue jeans with a super oversized
gray cardigan this is so pretty and
classy with it looks almost like a
bralette but it's not this is another
similar one I got except for this one's
not as loose it's a bit more
form-fitting
it's that crushed velvet look and this
is like a rose a rosy pink color I think
it's super pretty with the lace
detailing and again I think this would
be really pretty with anything high
waisted either tucked in or pulled out
with a cardigan so I saw this bad boy on
Windsor and it was gray and it was a
sweater so why not it this is off the
shoulders though it's only on the
shoulders for this reason because it's
on a hanger but I really liked this
crochet knit yeah see that how nice is
that and then the ends of the sleeves
kind of go in a bit and this is really
flattering with a bunch of different
delicate necklaces
really tight tight black jeans and
booties that are a little bit have a
little heel but not too much I think
that kind of outfit is perfect together
and if you had your hair in a super
messy bun or out in like a low really
messy pony so you can really show off
like your shoulders with this I think
it's so pretty and classy and it's
really soft it's not too long and it's
not cropped I don't know how to explain
that it's like a normal size whatever it
is pay laughs gray sweater I promise
this next purchase is from American
Eagle so I got three things and again
one of them is in the wash right now
because I literally were yesterday but
this sweater is one of them the one I'm
wearing right now it's a white fleece
sweater that's probably why I'm sober
exposes because of this sweater my
apologies but I just I love it it's
literal fleece you see this it is eight
will link it wrapped around your body as
a sweater and you can unzip it and then
this one is really pretty as well
because you can wear it off the shoulder
I wore this in a picture with a scarf
and I thought it was really pretty
so this full knit is really long so
again with leggings this would be cute
this would even be cute with a scarf
some leggings and just like plain
sneakers any kind of sneakers white
preferably oh my god I completely forgot
to show you something else from Windsor
I got fuzzy dogs how cute and I have
been holding off opening these so I
could show them in the video just
because I thought the packaging was so
cute but I've been dying to wear these
so I got the topi pink colors so there's
this really nice dusty rose and a really
nice like muted peach and I just thought
this would be so perfect as a stocking
stuffer for Christmas I think that it
would be such a good gift fuzzy socks
will never make anyone disappointed
anything fuzzy and soft will make me
happy then I went shopping on revolve
obviously you guys know I love revolve I
showed a bunch of this in my haul on my
vlogging channel when I did get the
package in the first one being this
romper this I was thinking would be
super nice like if I was in Europe and I
had some like tights underneath with
some heeled booties and a leather jacket
and then I was going out for a nice
dinner
I thought that would be really pretty I
am so bright right now then I think I
decided to wear this for Christmas
dinner I have a button like that and
then I have it tucked in to high-waisted
black jeans with booties and a bunch of
necklaces like dainty chokers I think
that would be so pretty then the next
thing I got was this faux fur jacket
this is by the brand lovers and friends
I like it because it has collapse I got
it in the size large so it could be
super oversized I think this is so nice
on a night out when you have a really
cute slip dress under that's like either
silk or velvet and then you have this on
top with like thigh-high booties I love
that look I wore it for my engagement
photos not this jacket but another faux
fur jacket I have and the last thing I
got is another faux fur kind of cardigan
but it's not really fur it's like frills
or something like I don't know if you
could see the material yeah it's not fur
but it's a cardigan and it's super super
soft and comfy and just from Tularosa
again and I just it's long I just think
this cardigan is so nice I love this
color so for the giveaway you will be
