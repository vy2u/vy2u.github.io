my channel if you can't tell I have a
really bad cold right now so that's why
my voice sounds like this I'm all stuffy
and sucks I haven't done an output of
the week video and so long and they're
one of my favorite videos to film I
realized because there's so much fun I
always just like play music and dance
along like my favorite songs at the
moment and so my own so what I decided
to do this time is to use the song I
like the best for that outfit like kind
of basically choose my five favorite
songs so I've been listening to at the
moment and kind of put them towards each
outfit now with YouTube obviously I
can't use a song for more than like 30
seconds so unfortunately each outfit is
under that time but I really wanted to
like give you taste of like the kind of
used to come into right now and I love
old-school rock and roll I love oldies
I just I'm end up behind right now so if
you want me to make a Spotify playlist
or something either wanted to do one for
a while now but let me know if you guys
are interested oh my hair is still flat

a beautiful spring so I'm just showing
you my winter to spring outfits for when
the weather is not sowing outside so for
