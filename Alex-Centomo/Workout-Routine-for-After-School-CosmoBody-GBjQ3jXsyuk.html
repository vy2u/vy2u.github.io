with a really exciting video I get so
many questions on my Instagram and my
YouTube to do another workout routine I
know I did one not too long ago but that
was in the summertime and I know about
with the school mines when you're
working hard and you have assignments
and tests and exams it's really hard to
stay motivated and do a workout routine
on a regular day basis and you know kind
of keep up a healthy lifestyle
so I actually came across something that
really works for me and I figured I
would share it with you guys because I
know that you guys really want
motivation and you guys want to get into
the healthier lifestyle of things and I
just think that since this worked really
well for me that it would work really
well for you so I'm sure most of you
guys are familiar with Cosmopolitan
magazine if not then there are a really
famous amazing magazine that you will
see in any drugstore any newsstand so
cause well actually has an online sector
for fitness and it's called Cosmo body
and the first thing that stood out to me
when I clicked on the link who's that
how motivating it seemed I love
Cosmopolitan magazine and I love working
out and the two combined which is like
an awesome thing for me so there's a
section called challenges and I think
they have around nine challenges right
now anything that has to do the
challenge I'm up for especially what it
has to do with Fitness I love it I just
find it keeps me motivated
and it's not that like you're
challenging other people it's more like
a challenge to yourself which I find
really important because you do want to
challenge yourself so there is a section
in the challenges called the college
girls guide to hotness and this one was
just it struck me right away so I was
like college okay well I mean working
out when you're in school is super
important finding ways to stay motivated
in school is super super important so as
soon as I clicked on the link I was like
okay it kind of gives you a brief
description of what the challenge is
about who the host is I just thought
that it would be perfect for you guys
because most of you are in school and
you're finding it really hard to kind of
you know get motivated and keep on a
regular routine of working
I tried out the challenge and I thought
it was awesome not only do I think it
was awesome but I actually died it was
really good it was a good workout but it
wasn't like too overboard for someone
that she's just starting out I think
would be great because the host does
give you like alternate options and
stuff like that so it's really easy to
you know kind of go at your own pace in
your level but it's also really
motivating for someone that like you
know wants to keep up the cardio and
stuff and I actually did this challenge
with my sister because I want I didn't
want to do it alone I kind of want to do
it with someone and we had so much fun
what's great about this challenge is
that you don't need equipment and that's
one of the things I get from you guys
the most is I don't own dumbbells I
don't own an exercise rope I don't know
a treadmill oh I can't I'm not a member
at a gym so what do i do how do I
workout and especially for you guys that
are in a dorm room this workout would be
amazing for you just because you don't
need anything so the host of this
challenge is adam rosante and he is just
really amazing because he's so good at
keeping you pumped up and keeping you on
the ball and not wanting to you know
quit
he just keeps motivating it which is
great kind of makes you push through
like the tough times is I like to say
hey i'm adam rosante coming to you from
Oskar University in New York with our
campus challenge P oh oh the UH Z Y hi
buddy say sayonara to the Freshman
Fifteen these targeted workouts will
read your metabolism and keep you
feeling stellar we're giving you even
more energy because we know your
schedule demands it oh those booties
feelings come on come on that's it
um so what I do is I actually stream the
videos on my computer you guys can use
whatever device you want can use your
iPad your iPhone it's great for that
kind of stuff I just let's use my laptop
cuz the screen is biggest there's a
workout for five days so every day
something different so day one is
actually called do it in your dorm room
and I thought this was so awesome
because you can do it in your bedroom as
well like I just did my bed
and it was it worked for me fine so all
you need is a chair like that's
literally all you need is a chair it's
just crazy that you can do all these
steps and all these things like taking a
break from your studies so like if
you're studying at your desk and you're
just like oh I need a break to kind of
clear my head I know for me it happened
a lot when I was studying for like
midterms or finals I'd be studying on
stops the point where like I wasn't
really retaining the information anymore
just because I had been like on repeat
so it's really good to take a little
like half hour break between your
studies think about something else get
focus on something else that way when
you get back to it it's like fresh in
your mind and you can go from there so I
find doing something like a workout was
really good it gets your heart rate up
it gets your blood flowing and it just
it makes you feel a lot better and I
just think that you know a healthy heart
leads to a healthy brain needs to help
you soul it's true it really is true
you'll feel so much better inside
knowing that you actually got your
workout done for the day and you did in
your bedroom is amazing so day two the
challenge is called the Bleacher workout
and I thought this was really cool
because every school has bleachers and
if your school doesn't have bleachers
I'm sure there is a part or similar near
your dorm room your house wherever
you're staying that there are bleachers
and even if you don't have reaches near
you you can use a bench
so day three is called score cheerleader
abs and this one right away kind of
reminded me like of the exercises I did
back when I was swimming being a summer
you need to have a really strong core
and these exercises are great for
scoring those great amazing ABS I was
great about these workouts is that
you're working something different
almost every single day but it all kind
of ties in towards the core and it just
makes you feel amazing but in week day
four is called get hot for homecoming
and this one is really fun because you
can do it with a friend you can do it on
your own
the last one is called small spirits
sweats ash and this one was really fun
and what's great about like doing it
with him is that you feel like you're
doing it with a bunch of people because
he has all of his friends there and
they're all doing it together and like I
said before it's just very motivating so
