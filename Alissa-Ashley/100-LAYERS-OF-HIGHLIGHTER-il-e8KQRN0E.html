so today's video is going to be a little
bit different than the other ones on my
channel it's going to be a bullshit-ass
video because I'm gonna do something
that's really really silly but it's been
a trend
ever since simply nail logical okay
Christine aka the queen of the Hollow
sexuals I'm a hollow sexual if you watch
this Christine I love you she started
polish Mountain so everyone has been
doing like 100 layers of foundation 100
coats mascara 100 layers look lipstick
well hundred a hundred hunter
so I decided because I haven't seen it
done and if it gets done before I happen
to post this cuz people have been
posting like crazy I'm not a biter okay
I just decided you know I left glow so
I'm gonna do a hundred coats or whatever
you call it
layers of highlighter and this video
should put me to shame because I was
collecting on my highlighters and I
didn't realize how many I owned and I
feel like damn bees like oh I don't
he'll of highlighters so I'm going to
take on the challenge of applying a
hundred layers of highlighter to my face
it probably won't look that great but
it's gonna be fun let me remind you guys
that everyone doing these videos it's
just for fun okay you have to be a
douche-lord
it'd be like oh this is stupid it's like
just just love you life you know my just
hmm you know I'm saying wait did be cool
be cool so if you want to see me apply
100 layers of highlighting to my face
they just keep on watching
okay so I have about 90 of them in this
thingy right here I have to find 10 more
so but I'm sure that that will be for a
while now so let me go ahead and get
started to make this a little more
interesting I'm applying cream
highlighters first and then paddle has
on top because it's still with a
highlighted category evils in that
powder so let's get started
Jesus I'm really not ready for this you
guys oh my god okay so they're just
sitting on my lap right now so let's
take okay let's get started
geez how does already look crazy
whose side of your highlight and for all
of my powder highlights I'm using my
more feet be eight brush I love this fan
brush you guys okay
oh hey literally feels like my cheeks
are gonna like break I cannot wait to
like zoom it to show you guys how oh my
god okay
oh my god call you my cellphone they
never knew me call me on my cell phone
they never knew me call me tomorrow
then I when you call me on my cell
then I when you need love call me on my
cell phone my first kiss back thank you
here's the bag that I would put another
highlighters intubation and kept count
oh my god this is so heavy
Jesus 100 coats or layers of highlighter
did and my ultra just said why are you
cracking let's look at it oh this looks
it looks it put on the ice lilies it is
a little bit bad from afar from for got
a little closer and just the freaking
lighting a little bit
the supermom okay so here it is up close
I'm trying like Li no we're not falling
but you can see the cracking good see
the freaking cracking gonna texture
looks terrible
well it's tale from this side mm-hmm I
smile it feels like all Titans oh it
feels so weird so that is the finished
video again it was just for fun and I
kind of want to see how it would look I
kind of predict it'll look a hot mess I
was hoping that will look a little bit
like more fierce but it just feels like
a bunch of stuff in my face you got you
seen a person but just fun to do just
fun to like not stress over video and I
was stressing lately I'm just can free
I'm even though there's a lot of glitter
everywhere a lot of stuff my computer
