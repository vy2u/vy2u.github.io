in my last video I asked you guys if you
would like to see a routine for everyday
you know for school work or wherever
you're going that's a little bit more
time friendly so here you have it I hope
you guys enjoy it if you do please
subscribe and we're gonna jump right
into the tutorial the first thing you
want to do is apply your foundation you
can use a BB cream if you prefer but I
cannot find mine so I'm going to use the
most natural foundation that I have
which is my cover X it's the natural
finish foundation and I'm going to first
apply this my hands and kind of you know
blend it in as much as possible and then
I'm going to finish my blending with my
Beauty Blender it just gives a really
really nice natural look
now to conceal I'm going to use a shade
that is only one shade lighter than my
natural skin tone and I'm doing this
because typically I do a shade that is
about two to three shades lighter but
since we're going for a more natural
kind of look I'm only going to go one
shade lighter just to you know brighten
up my under-eye to make me look more
awake but nothing too full glam and I
chose to use my la girl one because it
has a brush on it so it makes the
application much easier and now I'm just
going to work on setting everything in
place I'm going to set what a light
loose translucent powder I find this is
the easiest because with translucent
powders you know you just don't have to
take too much time on it because it just
blends right into your skin is
translucent so I'm going to use the same
powder for under my eye and my entire
face
and next I'm going to define I'm going
to use the three method for a more
seamless contour as you can see on these
side of my face I'm going in a three
light motion and this just makes the
contour look more seamless and just more
natural it doesn't look too you know
uniform it looks very you know just
effortless and that's why I want to go
for because it just looks more natural
and then this step is optional but I am
going to add some blush because I feel
like it adds you know a nice fresh you
know more awake and vibrant look you
know you don't want your face to be
completely muted you want to have some
color and now on to brows I'm going to
lightly conceal my brow arch and I'm
doing this because I do want you know a
little bit of definition but I'm not
going to go for that you know crazy you
know brow bone highlight just very very
simple and then I'm going to fill in my
brows with brow powder only I feel like
brow powder alone looks very very
natural so I'm going to use that and I'm
going to follow my brows natural shape
next I'm going to just define my lashes
by applying a light coat of brown
mascara just to you know dog up a bit I
decided to go with brown as opposed to
black because I feel like sometimes with
black it makes me want to you know just
add more makeup because black is so bold
whereas Brown is a little bit more
neutral and subtle but it still dresses
up the lashes nicely so you don't look
you know so zombified and then this step
is you know optional but I just love eye
light so I'm gonna apply a highlight and
as opposed to using one with a lot of
shimmer I'm going to grab one that has
more Sheen because she needs hype
highlights with minimal shimmer tend to
look more natural and for the last step
of this look I'm going to apply some
gloss I prefer pigmented glosses because
they add color and they're not so high
maintenance like lipsticks and liquid
lipsticks are they're just very simple
and you can reapply them throughout the
day and they just you know they're easy
and you want easy and then after that
this is the finished look I really hope

makeup application quicker other than
that thank you so much for watching be
