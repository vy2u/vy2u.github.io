by the title of this video you know this
is going to be a video of me comparing
my beloved maid Lane shine free and
loose powder and then we recomm paired
to the Chanel calendar libras any
natural or natural finishing process
you're going to compare the two because
this powder is $5 and this powder is my
$50 so as you can see the price point is
powders are pretty coming there you know
is that's the gap so we're going to put
both them on one side of each face and
we are going to see how they keep up
throughout the day okay so let's go
ahead and put on our face and just to
make sure each sides match up so that
each powder gets a fair shot where I
take the Milani prime light primer slap
that onto our face for foundation taking
my NYX total control drops and pay
between 15 and 16 mix and we'll go ahead
and take this morphe g 8 brush to blend
it out I actually just discovered how
freaking good this brush is for blending
foundation literally like a couple days
ago it is so nice you just kind of
smooth it against your skin because it
has a kind of a good angle to it it's
really nice
alright have to wait to wear this will
do and as we take a Tarte
sponge and usually if I applied too much
foundation I smell it the sponge and
just Pat away the excess a damp sponge
and then for concealer I'm gonna go
ahead and take how do I use this one and
then how I use that one I'm gonna I'm
gonna take my L'Oreal True Match super
blendable concealer
all righty now how far our powders is
okay so we have our $5 powder and this
is a shine free loose powder by
Maybelline and I discovered this after
now when I discover it maybe over a year
ago and I just sometimes go to Walmart
and I'm okay we'll come on fire too big
okay I buy a base for a candle and I saw
these alike hmm now this may really work
so I bought it and I've been in love
ever since
imagine I got the freaking label I
ripped the freaking label but I'll just
have a pop-up because I'm in shambles at
this point I learned with the label this
is okay screw labels there's no fancy
packaging it's very simple and honestly
I mean the only I don't love about it is
that the cap on it it's not the most
obscure cap so it can come off very
easily it's no screw you just pop it
open but I mean it's fine and then it
comes with a little puff as well the pup
isn't super soft so I may even different
puffs or both of the powders but I want
to just be even for this puff yeah I
don't know license kind of puppet come
in powders they just are not my style
and then we have the chanel natural
finish loose power loose loose powder
and this is translucent three they have
one two and three and the three is the
deepest shade obviously it's not really
it has a tint to it as you can see as a
tint to it focus on the palate it has a
tint but it's not it's still translucent
so she told me that it will not give me
a hint of dark in me or even back so I'm
hoping for the best
this will comes with a puff as well but
this stuff is much softer I still do not
like this kind of puff so I wouldn't use
it anyway but this is much softer than
the Maybelline one and let's do a
comparison in terms of how much product
you get for this one you get any grams
of products and this one you get 19
point eight grams of product so you get
more product the Chanel one so spite of
the last you launder unless you see how
it works and let's see what the claims
are for this one since you can have
anything
translucent satin finish they don't have
anything else so let's go in our piece
now okay so I'm going to go ahead and
take the maple and shine free powder
because I've used it before I've never
used the Chanel powder in my life our
new are no actually got it maybe a
couple months ago I'm not usually very
better I didn't feel like it but I just
think in my channel of course I will of
course I'll spin my point for you guys
hmm okay so I've dumped out my shine
three loose powder we're gonna take the
tart cookie blending sponge this is what
I would use for my powder take the
Maybelline and the Mabel's Devon decide
lens do it I just tap inside the powder
off excess and just pack pack pack and
of course when I pack on the restaurant
face as well just with under eyes
buffaloid this alrighty so the
Maybelline site is on go ahead open the
Chanel powder and we're going to dump
some into the cap and this one it seems
a little more fine then the maybelline
prior so let's just see how that plays
out it's definitely more finely milled
the Maybelline power not f6 yeah
definitely not sick this one does have a
perfumey fragrance to it and I really
love perfume fragrances but we'll see if
it goes away once it's all powdered on
then buff that away okay so my first
impression on this powder is that it's
pretty freakin smooth and rich they go
ahead and add some warmth to our skin
with the Black Radiance contour palette
and this is white to medium just some
more fee for and I'm just a go ahead and
warm up my cheek area and then a little
bit of blush all right even I go ahead
and do my brows and everything and I be
right back
so right now it is currently 932 oh
there you go 9:32 a.m. so I'm gonna go
ahead and just run my errands do my do
my day and I'm going to come back later
and we can see how it lasted so go ahead
and just go do my thing and I'll be
right back with you guys
alrighty so it is now 4:17 so I found
out like what I was tend to like 9:30
Dee's basically damn near 8 hours and
here is what we are looking like right
now
after I wise both sides were good to me
both sides
stay pretty flawless pretty nice the
rest of the face looks pretty nice as
well but to me the dead giveaway for me
personally with powders is the nose area
because that's like my problem area just
kind of like this area right here and to
me you can definitely see on both sides
that the Chanel powder got more oily you
can see the oil I don't want to touch
you look like ruin the makeup but the
only nut oily the Chanel I got more oily
than the Maybelline sign the maybelline
side it didn't stay super matte like I
can see it in person where it's
beginning to get a little bit she me but
I mean very huge difference between this
all going on and this she is going on so
I think we have a winner guys I think we
have it now honestly speaking with my
nose I kind of expect to get oily anyway
so when it comes to my makeup I don't
really get shocked over my milligan oily
usually whenever I can tell applause
seems like terrible is when the rest of
my face starts getting oily kind of like
do how you get oily and you dry and I
think that here let me go ahead and all
I'll have to do is take a little bit of
it and just tap it I mean and there we
go just by the nose so of course do I
love having to you know retouch on my
makeup no but I'm realistic I know that
my nose gets oily no matter what so I
kind of expected so I online going in
and touching it up if I have to but that
is it for this video if you guys like
these kind of videos please make sure to
give it a thumbs up and let me know what
other products you want me to compare so
I can do it next week because I think
this is kind of fun so maybe we can do
like a weekly thing or we try out
product versus products and you can
decide the winner and yeah I can let you
know so you save your money and get the
team or product or should you splurge a
little bit and get the fancy schmancy
so thank you guys so much for watching
the let me know your thoughts and I will
see you guys in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
