for today's video as you can see i'm
barefaced i know that my last couple
videos i've been starting out with a
makeup full face of makeup and then to
do an eye shadow but today's video is
going to be different i am going to be
trying out a bunch of new face products
or new to me because i'm sure they'd
better market for a while now but i'm
trying out new products more
specifically high-end super duper
high-end products because i want to see
if these products are worth the money
and yeah we're gonna try the master
basis you guys want to see me do that
and just keep on watching ok so the
first image is take this sicily double
come to ur instant long-term yeah
whatever this is this is freaking super
expensive victims name this $200 primer
because that's what it is but a lot of
people talk about it and say that it is
amazing so we're going to see if it is
indeed amazing today go and just pump
them out I'm gonna be really really yeah
make sure my um no too much because it's
almost $200 I've never spent that much
on any product of my life
or makeup product ok feels pretty nice
and sticky which is usually good for a
primer now for foundation I am going to
use the Tom Ford waterproof foundation
or the foundation and concealer and I
don't know it just sounded pretty cool
it's waterproof allegedly so I want to
see how this last what the day I'm gonna
go ahead and just pump outside into my
hand and I'm wondering which is the best
way to apply it I'll probably use a
blending sponge to prevent my style
one thing I was excited about is that it
seems to be a really nice match to my
freaking skin I find that with a lot of
high-end foundation and just high in
proxxon general I can never find my
exact shade of actually get it's like si
la tur Double Wear but like a is it
different it's a new ones making more
lightweight I guess I'm going to get
that but I can buy two of them because
they don't have my freaking shade it's
so annoying like I always have to make
shades because these brands and do this
thing oh that's pretty
where they just kind of do light light
light light boom
here you go here the dark shade for you
guys guys will complain doesn't mix you
know like the deepest shade with one of
the other light shades like get it
together get it together and I'm using
this as your Vaughn Chi
Davonte sponge because I want to keep it
really nice and fancy and bougie this
was $20 same prices Beauty Blender so
though I mean I guess that's not too up
there it really just depends on how life
is fun fun sponge blend doll but so far
it's doing a pretty nice job so so far
so good for Casteel I'm taking the nudie
or concealer this is the said Dior skin
forever undercover concealer and this is
the shade 0:40 where I go ahead and use
this to highlight
yeah this sponge definitely has my
approval because sometimes it's so hard
getting into the wood he got this little
super inner corner but this one got into
that corner no problem super easy to set
my highlighted area I'm taking this YSL
to slay de clock and I actually got this
because I saw Jackie ina missing it in a
video and I'm literally like ran to
Nordstrom 30 minutes for a closing
comment I need the power 10 if you type
enough powder and I checked I was like
because I tried the other one if I had
bought two of them so super expensive
day-to-day because I bought the number 4
first because they did not have number 3
and the number 4 is more like a setting
powder for the rest of my face so I went
and bought number 3 so I can set the
under eye so I've tried number 4 or
we're trying number 3 because this one
probably more Universal and ideal for
baking so that is what we're using for
today now I'm gonna take the number 4
shake them out and we're going to use
number 4 to set the rest of our face and
now I'm going to go ahead and just dust
all this off and see what we're looking
like ok
not gonna lie we look flawless but we I
mean me I mean it looks pretty good I
was a little nice matte 5 Beauty chemist
flawless
I knew Jackie wouldn't stand me wrong
with these powders this looks great now
go ahead and add some color because I
just look like a blank a blankety-blank
blink as I was like I would like to try
this Marc Jacobs fantastic and we're
just going to see cuz I mean it doesn't
really look like it will be the con
thing to show them my skin tone but I
just want to try it to Z so see ok did
not show up so moving in last-minute hmm
we're going to use my Chanel powder this
is not new to me but this is like the
best high-end bronzes I've ever tried
haven't tried mini so like I mean I'm
not saying it's the best on the market
but it works out for me because it's
just so warm and it's a more feet in
five to seven okay no okay no my cat
literally just came in here and he has
my bra in his mouth he just he'd like my
bra he just brings it wherever like he's
literally got it from our room and Brian
here and never bless we're gonna take
our NARS and this is the NARS little
blush and torrid shake it well I think
just to contest it on its own I'm not
going to put a powder blush on top of it
I'm thinking about this and yeah we look
like and then frost highlight we're
going to take the Lancome dual finish
highlighter this is radiant rose gold
number three I don't know why they
include little sponge no one's I use
that apply the highlight that they do a
concerned and let's go ahead and just
pop this out let's see you'll first want
to use to apply this I'm gonna take this
little bdellium tools brush I've been
using Laelius of seven eight seven and
we're just going to apply this and see
how it looks
i'ma go ahead and spray this tacha
doobie skin mist all righty I was going
to go ahead and pause some lashes after
doing my brows and just call it a day
but since I'm sitting here and since
we're using products are super expensive
I thought why not go ahead and give you
guys my thoughts on the Natasha Jonas
sunset palette and do a little quick
eyeshadow look while I talk about it so
let's go ahead and do that because I
said $140 on this palette yes I know
so ridiculous can I go ahead and just do
a little minimal look while talking
about it the thing or the main thing I
want some of the palette is that it is
possibly the most overpriced pile that
I've ever bought in my entire life
and it's hardly worth it applying this
orange right now it's me the
pigmentation on it yeah it's showing up
but I have Palace especially that one I
used I was at Wednesday right for a pro
warm palette that one the quality of
that palette is better the quality of
this palette and this was $140 after-tax
that's like double the price of the
Sephora one and you get more icons for
one and even the Jacklyn and morphe
understand morphe hills the Jackson
Hillary palette you get more freakin
colors and they're more pigmented in
this crap I'm not gonna cuss but yes
look it it's barely pigmented go ahead
and use a yellow barely pigment to
yellow applying another shade as you can
see it's barely showing up long story
short this palette with a huge effing
disappointment and I would highly
recommend you put your money towards
either the Jackson Hale more be balanced
or the Sephora Pro palette if you want
to be a little more on the pricey side
because the Jackson one is the likely
expensive then you have this 401 and
then you have this this doodoo it's not
a worth it like so let me get rid of
this fallout go ahead just put a shimmer
on the lid show you guys to the shimmer
look
right now I'm getting cause a burning
sensation where I applied the shimmer
shadow and that usually only happens
with pallets that are extremely
extremely cheap like yeah so I'm sure a
lot people bought it because of the high
parotid because it looks so beautiful
and they probably were just as
disappointed as I am because they're
just so many other tops on the market
that are way more affordable that do
better I just want to go ahead and clue
this because save your money please
don't buy the fuzzums it's soul oh
whatever
let's go ahead and just vamp on a lip
color for lips I use Mac's quick lip
liner and NARS géza lip gloss and this
is amazing high-end lip gloss so now I
can go ahead and just go about my day it
is 11:30 so what the today is something
it needs a degree okay so it is going to
be hard to tell today so it'll be really
interesting to see how all this keeps up
in that heat I was not expecting 80 what
the heck so yeah we're gonna go ahead go
our date and I will come back and let
you guys know how everything kept up
alrighty so here we are it is now what
time is it
it is now 913 I have a little dog after
a freaking wall favorite couple on
Twitter is smokey so I just wanted to be
happy but is now 913 so I think we've
gotten enough hours I'm so tired
I want a little bit but here we have our
face okay let me just do a breakdown of
all the things I used and what I know
I'll probably use again okay so the 50
primer we are definitely using this
again because I think my makeup for it
to be on for so long for it to be over
freaking 90 degrees outside
damn near today it lasted really good
just look at everything according to a
some oil around my nose but different
times where it's an extreme oil so this
isn't even as bad as it can get or as I
seem again I should say so everything
looks so good
the foundation is gorgeous I honestly
expected to have more of a
matte finish and just super dramatic I
don't know why I thought that maybe the
names kind of amazed okay maybe Wendy
super matte but it was not at all and I
mean in a good way it kind of has more
of a skin like finish to it where it's
not super dewy and oily but it's not
through matte either so look at that
look at that I'm looking my new fighters
I'm hoping you guys to see what I see it
looks really good it was a great color
Mac in my opinion it looks beautiful on
snapchat and I liked it because I mean
like I mentioned there's so many
high-end brands where I have to mix two
shades to get my shade it's the most
frustrating thing ever if so irritating
sound glad that I was able to just do
one and then we have the powders now the
power number four I'm definitely going
to be using this as my face powder I do
however feel like I want to always be
able to use my Sephora my Christmas and
I actually have a different video plan
where I explain why this powder is so
crucial in my routine and what I noticed
whenever I do not use it I won't talk
about too much yet because I kind kind
of pissed me a tail as well
the support- moves really like amazing
I'm explaining up the video but the
number three powder how to explain it
mountain honey come here for me it
didn't look as flawless as I'm used to
is looking so I just kind of preferred
that but throughout the day it got
better so I guess that is going to make
a difference and then for the Chanel
bronzer that's on my favorite bronzer so
that's that's is good and in the liquid
blush it actually lasted pretty nice
about the date I've heard that blush is
usually the first thing to know
hey blush is usually the first thing to
vanish from your makeup is the first
thing to time disappear and to me I'm
Yama what do you guys think the bless is
still there it looks pretty healthy it
doesn't look shocky and it kind of like
smoothes into my skin or whatever we're
in public for a colleague's disappeared
but you know I mean like I think you to
my skin it looks like a healthy kind of
rosy cheek so I like that about that and
overall I mean I think my face was great
for me to be wearing it for this long
and just for this weather
take on school right go ahead I also
want to quickly show you guys this other
powder that I try it out and I kind of
want to finish off the video with this
powder because high-end - and I used it
a lot in LA and it definitely kept my
makeup looking you know I use it and
freshen up and whenever I get this
little oil this is what I use in LA it's
a Charlotte Tilbury
airbrush flawless finish I got the shade
number two and all you do you know like
whenever you coggan oily you just Pat it
on as you can see just like flying that
powder now this whole area does not have
any sort of oil going on at all and it
looks pretty good other than that
that is it for the video I hope you guys
liked it I hope that means spending on
my money and trying all these things it
was you know like we're good and hope
you guys enjoyed this kind of video if
you guys do want to see any other video
of this nature maybe a low-end version
and drug servers and then please let me
know and I will do so and if you guys
just kind of have any other feedback or
any other video ideas you guys have and

than that thank you guys so much for
