today's tutorial is going to be a look
using the Anasazi of modern Renaissance
Palace I asked you guys on snapchat
which palette you want to see me do a
look on and you guys said this one so
here it is I decide to do something very
matte favorite a simple no shimmer like
that's a shock to me I always put
shimmer on my lid mine isn't really nice
in matte kind of smoked it out on the
outer corners and I just kind of blown
with the flow here palette has so many
gorgeous matte shades so I just really
really want to use my favorites out of
the pan so I made sure to do that and
yet look is pretty simple very easy to
follow so hope you guys enjoy it other
than that nothing else much to say so
I'll talk to you guys soon be sure to
subscribe comment like good stuff
support if you feel like it and let's
just get into the tutorial okay so I did
my brows off-camera so I'm go ahead and
clean them up because it's a part of my
priming process now I'm going to take my
Urban Decay primer potion and just prime
my eye place that all on my lid I've got
to take this zoeva 142 concealer brush
just to buff that into my eye you get it
nice in prying gonna go ahead and put a
light layer of translucent powder on top
of that I always set my primers now the
first shade of my taking the palette is
called realgar helping out in that right
now butchering it but it's a really nice
burnt orange shade and I'm just going to
place this really really nicely onto my
crease area I'm also going to take you
down to my lid as well
and this is a zoeva to 2/7 off to finer
brush I'm going to switch over to a more
feet in b25 it is blank and I'm just
going to soften it up I'm also going to
take furniture or injustice on the outer
edges just to kind of get it more nice
and diffused out into the brow bone area
I want to be nice and blended I'm go
back in with rigor and just make sure
everything is nice into tint because I
do want this color to really pop not
going to take my kiss New York roaster
coffee lid pencil and just pop that into
my waterline and then with a zoeva to
3/4 brush we'll take a love-letter which
is a really nice pinky cranberry shade
in the palette and I'm just going to
start smoking out my waterline I'm going
to kind of bring this up into the outer
corner and almost create a wing with the
eye shadow let's start frying the outer
edge is a completely wing by bringing it
into the inner parts of the lid area and
you see what I'm doing I'm creating a
wing with the eye shadow and take that
more people rush and just soften it out
take it again
and I'm going to take this felt tip
liner by Fiona Stiles I'm going to
create an actual wing on top of that
shadow wing
now I'm going to take a little bit of
new arm which is on Stassi a single
eyeshadow and I'm just going to kind of
smoke out that wing by adding a little
bit of black shadow any black shadow
would do but I'm staying one brand for
the eyes so that's I'm using I'm estas
yet and I'm going to kind of smoke it
out just a little bit and I'm going to
take love-letter and just place it kind
of in the crease I just want the
love-letter and the rigor to mix
together to make a nice kind of burnt on
shuttle look and then for last I'm
taking Lena lashes in the style Naomi
and then while that's drying I'm gonna
apply some bottom lash mascara
now to go ahead work on the rest of my
face I'm going to bronze up with my two
face dark chocolate Soleil bronzer and
it's the morphe four brush gonna lazily
contour my nose because I really don't
have time for blush I'm taking mega
weeks puppy love it's a really soft pink
blush and at first initially I thought
I'd be too like me cuz it looks really
light but so soft it's so so nice good
job good job makeup geek you guys know I
love you so it's really nice I'm going
to take the newest glow kit Sun dipped
obviously and I'm gonna take summer and
moonstone I'm just gonna mix them
together and highlight
and then for lip color I'm I take my
kits New York roast coffee lip pencil I
was so bad using it now I've become just
like oh my god if I'm sick of me using
it it's just the best it's the best
i'lli'll it is dry I'm going to take
honest ah CEA's ash tilaka lipstick
and Alma forgot to hide them under the
flat fold so I'm taking which shades
this term align in the Sunday palette
and go ahead and set my face so here's
the finished look I really like how it
turned out I love you guys liked it as

see me do my whole face routine but I'm
