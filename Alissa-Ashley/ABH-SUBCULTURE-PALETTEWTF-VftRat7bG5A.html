today's video is going to be another
review I don't know I like doing reviews
more than I like doing just makeup
tutorials
I don't know I feel like it's better
because I'm essentially helping you guys
decide whether or not you want with your
money or not funding is more helpful
anyways today's video is going to be a
review on the new honest obvious
subculture pellet and yeah all of you
are excited about it
they wanna see if it's worth this so
I'll be reviewing it for you guys and
give you guys my honest thoughts like
always so if you guys want to seat your
you and a little demo because yeah I
want to create a really nice look not
sure what
so don't still expect a lot but I'm
going to try so if you guys want to see
it - just keep on watching ok so I went
ahead and took the palette out of the
box and it's so soft it's souza like you
just want to rub on it like a baby old
don't wanna be me that's weird but you
know I mean it's a lob and here's what
it looks like it did comfortable plastic
covering standard has a little mirror in
it let's go ahead and peel that off
pretty nice mirror you want use the
mirror to do it it's a pretty nice
mirror you guys know those towels I
kinda have a little cheap little mirrors
that you go like you okay we'll see look
blurry this is a nice mirror and here is
some talib so you guys have already seen
that already chance while you're
probably on the video coz you okay we
saw the parents we won all the palette
works so I'm gonna go ahead and just
yeah we jump into it and one thing I do
want to note is that this palette seems
like I don't know I like it because of
the fact that it's more mass than there
are shimmers hallelujah I cannot stand a
palette with a bunch of shimmers I think
I mentioned that in the Karrueche in
color pop video that it had a little bit
more shimmer that I prefer and I love
love love matte shades so this is my
mainly mask so I'm extremely excited
about that it has a shade fudge which
has appeared in a couple of amavasya
like palettes I want to say it was a
modern response it was another one it's
been a couple
I know that for sure it has a single of
it too so find this in here I like fudge
so I'm not mad about that I'm not mad
that keep using it and then let's see
clients like looking at assessing it
before I get it on nice and dirty I'm
going to use it for sure because it's a
nice pretty yellow I'm going to use a
shade edge for sure because it's like a
nice pretty mellow yellow this is a
mellow yellow for the week and MJ called
a new way we're just going to go ahead
and use it I am looking at it to kind of
get a feel for what I want to do and I
think I know I want to do let's go ahead
and just get started I'm gonna go ahead
and prime my eyes and my Smashbox
24-hour photo finish primer and freaking
stuff because yeah I need to get the cat
for the drive out is so devastating my
favorite primer although I'd use this
primer i okay so for the first shadow I
think I'm a dick into and let's go ahead
and do edge because my yellow is they
war p.m. five three three go ahead and
supply to see see what that does
the
okay so it seems to me more of a muted
mustard-yellow I was expecting it to be
a little bit more but it's okay that
it's not I don't know to me I love you
guys those by my reviews I tried my best
to not sit there and be all like oh
oh my god this is terrible I try to see
the vision so like maybe they didn't
want it to be like a super bright yellow
maybe they want them muted mustard
yellow and I think that this kind of
tone will look really pretty in the fall
time so yeah I don't I'm never super
negative are others I try not to be
because I just try to understand that
you know maybe this is what they want it
so this is very muted the only thing I
would say though is that it's blending a
little bit weird in terms with light
it's not super smooth you guys I can't
see it but I'm really like I can see it
it's like it gets dark right here and
then the yellow kind of picks up light
right here and then dark right here so
it's not a smooth blend but maybe once
we go over it it will get rid of it but
yeah that wasn't the smoothest blend of
the yellow that I tried before I have to
be honest with that okay that's cool
next I'll let me go ahead and blow this
off I'm going to take the shade new ways
and we're going to just pop that on and
see what it does
whoa whoa that looks more yellow than
the yellow so oh and then when you blend
it down I don't know if I'm really
liking this that much it seems like the
colors they apply bright and then once
you blend them out they go dark and it's
like I don't know that's kind of a CD in
a way because it's not Oh No
as you can see while the planets go on
light and then the more I blend it out
it goes car dark and it's just blending
a little bit funky I don't know it's
really weird to explain what I'm
experiencing but although the essence II
just kind of see a line right there
because it picked up more dark right
there and then around it it went light
it's so it's so hard to explain it but I
yeah I'm not that overjoyed by that but
I mean it looks okay I guess
yeah I'm not quite sure I'm not quite
sure I feel about it just yet okay so
I've blended two colors any cons looks
like there's nothing on my eye a little
bit I know I was going too weird
let me go ahead and switch to a
different brush a more kind of like pact
brush to see if it applies differently I
don't know let's go ahead and see maybe
it's a brush I'm using I'm trying to
give it a chance right now but it's
going to look burning a little bit weird
yes C applies light and then once you
blend it out it just kind of is the same
color but I don't really like shadows I
do that because they always been looking
really funky I don't know what's really
weird this is very weird I don't know
it's a little weird I'm gonna go ahead
and take a shake plush and let's hope
that this doesn't give me what the other
two shades are doing you go ahead and
use a different brush this is the morphe
in 573
I'm really not doing this I mean I'm
kind of shocked I don't know something
is blending weird I don't know if
because this primer you guys can use
this primer all the time it never does
anything like it's the best primer that
I have right now and everything's
blending really weird I'm hope you guys
can see you guys see that it's like it's
picking up dark right here and then
everywhere else is picking up
differently so it's creating a not even
blend this is really really strange I
mean it looks fine so far but I can see
it in person and it just looks a little
funky that looks really funky like it's
dark right here and then right in this
part the shadow pigment is not picking
up Brian this part I don't like this I
think i'ma go ahead and start over
because yeah this is a blending whoa
this is not this is kind of
disappointing so they go ahead and just
try it again
maybe the climb differently to see if
that helped but yes this nope we're
starting over
okay go ahead and try this one more time
I took some heart shape tape and I put
it on my eyes going to put a little bit
more and I guess we're going to do the
shape tape prime way because I guess
rhymer
isn't a good match pres apparently I'm
not sure but I mean it usually yeah I
don't know it has to be the palate cuz
that primary guide uses Smashbox it
literally makes every single a child
look amazing
and that's why I've been buying it over
and over again because the really good
primer so I'm really confused as to why
the shells and blending so funky when it
such a good primer I don't get that
maybe if I kind of blink out my eyes for
more okay so the eyes are prime go ahead
and try this one more time and let's see
I'm going to go ahead and use the same
exact colors that I instructed brush I'm
using the same exact colors but I'm
gonna try and this process of morphe in
five seven three and let's just see we
get different result
these different breasts
it's still doing the same thing it's
still creating that funky line I really
don't know what the hell I want cuz I
mean I'm getting annoyed right now like
what on earth is going on with this damn
valid this is blending like like
Isis but don't know what I'm doing wrong
and you know like just on my first time
doing eyebrows so you would think that
you know I know how to blend but you
guys see that you guys see the clear
division between it's like light right
here in the dark I don't understand that
let me go over with the NuWave shade I
want to fix this but it keeps doing the
same funky ass thing I'm getting so
irritated I'm getting really mad like
I'm like what the hell god do you guys
see what I'm talking about it's like a
clear in line
I literally prime my eye perfectly and
it's still doing that I really don't
know what the hell's going on like
getting so annoyed because I hate when
things do not work out but this palette
is pissing me off like what the
come on
I'm not - just call it a day and not
even use this because I should not have
to blend away that line I don't
understand right now like maybe you're
going skip those colors so new ways and
edge the yellow and the white orange
cancel um let's use some people to use
gum that year dated um
let's use all-star let's see if that
gives us some freakin love because I'm
getting mad like I'm just like what on
earth is going on let's see if this is
any good at least that's showing up
this is not blending good like I'm
really like I'm trying to hearing thing
okay is it me or another palette is it
too powdery I don't know but this is not
blending good like it's creating a line
right here like what in the one like
what the hell let's go ahead and try it
one more time and if it's blending funky
I'm not going my time like I'm trying to
review for you guys but it is Lin funky
one more time I'm cancelled I'm really
starting it on crazy because you know
like I don't think anyone else has this
problem unless they did and he didn't
say to the video because our moaning I
think okay maybe I'm just me wrong let's
go ahead apply I mean I want to do like
do I primal okay let's not use the
Smashbox primer then let's go ahead and
you shape tape just a blank out our eyes
I mean I really don't know what I'm
doing wrong this is the same way I
always prime my eyes and it never gives
me a problem I don't know I really don't
know I'm like I'm really confused right
now I'm really really love for it to
work you know and I don't want it to be
all mad at me like oh you did something
wrong ah you know like I don't want to
let anyone down but I don't know who
what is happening I really don't okay so
we did some shade tape and now go ahead
and powder it down just a little bit
because maybe because the eyeshadows are
like more on the powdery side maybe it
has that a powder base I genuinely do
not know let's go ahead and clap hotter
down a little bit with some translucent
powder okay so let's try this again this
is a more feet are 35 I really don't
even want to use that yellow anymore I
don't want to use the new wave anymore
because if they're both not working out
so let's take this shape right here it's
called Roxy on the end Club Roxy I'm
starting this shelves with powder you
can even me doing this you guys I'm
literally doing this it's creating a
whole pile I shadow right here like it's
literally just digging the eyes to eyes
oh my god I can create a whole in the
IRL with this it's really digging it out
so if I were to dump out my cans here
let me done with my hand show you guys
it's so powdery that it literally
dump so much I shot on my hand so yeah
what the hell like I'm like sitting here
like getting like what the hell anyway
it's glad I try to play that and let's
just hope it about honestly I'm getting
a lot of Fallout but I don't know I'm
beginning to think after all these views
fall out of standard this eyebrow is
really super powdery like you guys can
see how much powder is being collected
on the actual palette itself it's just
going to be just falling out of the pan
I'm gonna take hold of it right down to
show you guys because I'm just so mad
right now
insert photo that's how much powder is
just picking up and kicking back as I
use it I pick it up as I use it and you
know while a lot of palettes do that
I've never going to do it that much like
I've never say do that much so I'm
really yeah I'm becoming disappointed I
mean this one applied better but it
shouldn't take three times to get it
right like what if you're on the rush or
on the go and you want to create a
little bit of palette and that happens
that he had to keep wiping it off it's
gonna get annoying I'm just you don't go
to the pointed now let's go ahead and
take the shape all-star and let's put it
on top of here you so much fallout are
you serious
you guys I like what the hell am I doing
wrong
look at that like look it's not picking
up like it's not it's not I will not
explain it here well maybe I should get
an example iPod to show you what I show
should be doing hold on
I'm going to take a shadow from the
Sephora Pro palette and show you guys
what the aisle should be doing okay here
I applied a Sephora Pro shadow and see
how it's like nice and smooth and
slimming on top of it no problem and see
how you get in here and see how there's
a line right there even though where the
hell that line come from it's not
blending smoothly it's not blend
smoothly I don't know what the hell to
do like I don't know what to do I really
don't I really go oh come on come on I'm
serious and now this fallout will not go
away all you pay me right now I really
hate this file I'm so sorry I'm really
so sorry I feel so bad for not working
out I hate it like I can't do this
oh I've never had a palette that was so
irritating and so powdery and got
everywhere in the fallout you know when
it move on your eye I've never yeah I'm
sorry you guys but maybe
yeah I'm not I'm not about to lose my
mind trying to do a look I'm really not
this palette is irritating your pal it's
not blending right it's blending really
funky certain pigments are picking it up
in certain areas of the i/o it's not
blending smoothly I don't know if I know
when I got a faulty palate so I'm sorry
it's my review and comparison of the
review is bad maybe they want to piss on
the sake off but this palette for me
sucks it's super powdery and it has
hella fallout I just I'm not yeah I'm so
sorry
I'm so sorry I feel so bad that this did
not work out but I'm not going to hear
in Jonathas nut and
why my eyes over and over again because
that's that irritate my eyes and you
take my soul
so my verdict for the palate is that no
I'm not doing it I'm so irritated so
irritated because I really wanted to
work but my very first palate is that I
do not like it
maybe I got bad one because other people
seem to like it
or maybe maybe they're not being
truthful I don't know but I'm not like
it is to know for me I'm so sorry to not
work out I don't know what to do now
I've never acted like in a review like
this Wow Wow
then you guys for watching and I mean I
guess I'll see you guys soon
I have an edible to do I'll see you guys
soon I'm I'm so sorry I didn't work out
I'll see you guys soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
