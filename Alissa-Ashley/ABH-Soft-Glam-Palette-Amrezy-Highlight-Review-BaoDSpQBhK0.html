first days video we have a review and
this is on the new a BH soft glam
palette and I'm also gonna use the new
Omri Zee highlighter but mainly the
palette and a lot of you guys were
wanting this review for me and I think
that a lot wanted it because of my
subculture review and honestly like I'm
not one of those people that like I
don't know I'm not messy in the sense
that I'm not much to sit there and like
make this review dramatic and oh my gosh
like if she didn't like trash this
palette like I'm just gonna use the
palette and hope it works out like
that's literally like what I'm here to
do a lot of people thought that I
intentionally made the subculture pilot
not work out for me and it's like why
would I do that who has time for that
and grant it honestly speaking like the
way that the a BH team kind of handled
the subculture
Palli review especially like kind of
like with me I was not a fan of it I
didn't agree with it I didn't agree with
them like you know saying that basically
you need instructions to use a palette I
didn't agree with the fact that I kind
of got a little shade in my opinion
about the palette but other people their
reviews even though they're bad like
mine kind of got blessings and said oh
yeah we love your feedback I didn't like
a lot of stuff but honestly I'm here to
review products for you guys so that you
guys can determine based on my review if
you want to spend and get the product or
not or if you want to save your money
that's I'm here for so aside from just
all that industry honestly I'm just
here to review some makeup so if you
guys want to see my review on it then
just keep on watching I hope you guys
enjoy so as you guys can see I already
have my base makeup on because I'm
reviewing another product and I don't
know which videos might go up first but
whatever I review another product so the
base is done so let's go ahead and open
up the palette here is what it looks
like and I actually really like the
color of it I'm really a huge fan of
yellows I'm sure you guys know I'm
always wearing yellow so I like this I
like this a lot actually and then just
like subculture and modern Renaissance
has that soft feeling to it I don't not
know the material but I like the
material
I let's see let's go and open it up pass
a little plastic and here it's what the
palette looks like let me go ahead and
show you guys I have not touched it
here's what it looks like it does come
with a brush but I never used the
brushes in the palette only because they
just are never very that satisfying and
they don't really work very well for me
because I just yeah I cannot blend with
this so and I think this is the same
brush as all their palettes and I've
tried before so I'm gonna waste my time
because I'm using the brushes that I
know work for me and let's just go ahead
and look at the palette I'll just allow
the details to pop up on the screen
about the palette I do not know what
look I want to create but I'm obviously
it's gonna be a soft glam look and just
the first impression on this palette I
definitely think that it's definitely
more inviting in subculture and I know
the account with one Prizm I think it's
more inviting to the eyes because the
colors are very like just toned down and
soft and everyday wearable and I feel
like it's so cool to have a palette that
you can use every single day so I
definitely think that when I first saw
the palette I was like oh I'm like this
would be a really good everyday palette
because it just has all the codes in
there for an everyday look and they're
very soft on the eyes and not too
intimidating because I know that like I
don't know sometimes when you see a
palette and you see like some bold
colors you're just like okay am I gonna
use those and you kind of like panic
you're okay I'm not going to use those
and I'm not gonna buy it but I
definitely feel like looking at this
palette there's about one two three four
five six seven eight nine ten eleven
twelve twelve shades in here that I
would realistically use more than once
so that is a good sign so let's go ahead
and just stop talking and prime the eyes
and get into applying the shadows also
do not quote me but I'm pretty sure that
I saw novena tweet that this is the same
formula as modern renaissance so if it
is we will not have any problems because
I like muttering songs let's go ahead
and just prime the eyes this is my color
pop concealer and this is a morphe e 20
and I'm ago I haven't taken my favorite
blending brush at the moment I'm sure
you guys I've been seeing me use this a
lot this is from it's my ray Ray's
collab with BH Cosmetics I love this
brush I've been like using it like every
single freaking look let me go ahead and
peel off the plastic on this mirror so
we're gonna use just the mirror in the
palette and then I think oh I do not set
my lids by the way I think I'm gonna
start with orange soda is she we're just
gonna tap this on and as you can see
it's not really showing up which is not
a bad thing because I mean I'm not blind
I can look at that color and I can tell
it's not really gonna like make a huge
difference but that's exactly what I
want I want this to be the base color so
yes I am applying it it's very subtle in
makeup if you have a lighter complexion
or even a dark complexion but for me
this is a definitely a very yeah it's
very simple just base color and then
right off the bat I will show you guys
this it's not doing that remember that
crazy when you dipped it just kind of
became a disaster it's not doing that
it's not doing that so that is a good
thing it is getting a little bit messy
but that's just like a normal palette
like you dip and it gets a little bit
like I'm not saying that no palette
should have like no dust it gets a
little bit but definitely what's up
culture it was very very a lot so we're
not getting that now I'm gonna go ahead
and take Sienna
let's take Sienna okay I definitely did
not mean to go in that pigment it cuz I
was gonna try to make this look soft but
that's okay okay I'm taking a little bit
more orange soda just to tone it down
and blend it out with
you're okay now we're going to take out
other eye too
and then mmm and then I guess I'm gonna
apply rustic then I want to take one
more matte just for the sake of it for
the heck of it Hamitic mulberry
I've been right there I don't know what
I did
okay and then I'm gonna take gonna get
my other brush I'm gonna take come on
take one shimmer I might take rose pink
because it's very like saddening and I
don't want anything like too dramatic in
terms of shimmer let me get my mixing
medium I can I find my mixing medium so
I just took some morphe setting spray
and just wet my brush that is a very
pretty color and then I go ahead and put
a little bit of Sienna on the bottom
part of the eyes
and a little bit of mulberry on the
outer corner and I will go ahead and
just throw on some mascara and now let's
go ahead and applied this I'm reesy
highlighter before we share our final
thoughts on the palette this is what it
looks like it's opening it up very nice
and pretty I love love love the
presentation of it a lot like when I
first saw it I was like ooh that looks
really cool
Ripple's looks really pretty a unique
let's go ahead and take this brush it's
from its my Raees collab a bead
cosmetics I really like the brushes a
lot so I'm gonna wipe it off first
because I could tell I have highlight on
it now let's go ahead and dip into this
highlight I'm just gonna go hey let's
see oh I got it uneven let's do that
again
oh wow ooh that's really pretty you can
see that well you guys see how it's not
like sitting on my face it's given a
comic or reflective situation and then
when I turn to the side obviously I have
to set it but I'm not getting like super
like a shiness oh no I feel like
sometimes when highlighters are too
white or they're too thick they sit on
your face in a very unattractive way and
it's not good but this one isn't doing
that to me so I'm very happy about that
and then for lips I'm going to take a
little bit of this NARS Velvet lip glide
and this is bound just a bounder bound
it bound I think and then just a little
bit of lip oil on top to give it some
more Sheen okay so time for thoughts
let's just go ahead and get the
highlighter out of the way so we can
talk more about the palette in terms of
this highlighter it is really nice and
pretty I do prefer highlights with a
little bit more gold in it because I
feel like it's it's on my skin better
because I'm more warm so like I don't
know it just looks better when it has a
little touch of gold but I definitely do
see myself layering this highlight on
top of other highlights just to kind of
mix in some gold like I'll use the
Maybelline master chrome and then pop
this on because it's really nice and
pretty so I mean yeah I have no
complaints about it really for the
palette let's pick it up I'll go ahead
and just show you guys what it looks
like on the first use so I definitely
and I didn't blow it off I definitely
think that in terms of the comparison to
how when I use subculture I definitely
this looks much better because I'll have
to do is just it looks fine so I'm glad
about that I think that I definitely
have more luck with this palette then I
did the last one I reviewed from ABH so
I'm happy about that because I did fires
my own money so I can definitely see
myself using this
pallette honestly like I like it I like
it a lot so yeah I mean I'm trying to
give anything else I have to say about
it
I kind of don't yeah I think it's fine I
think my favorite shadow though is rose
pink because that was greedy like I
almost wonder if I could use as a
highlight but I don't want to look crazy
but let me see yeah no I probably can't
but if you have a deeper complexion try
that out because I feel like it's like a
rosy golden color and I think that
that's so pretty
like that's really really pretty but
aside from that I don't really have
anything else to say about the palette I
don't really have any negatives um yeah
I don't really have any negatives I do
not I think that it served me well and I
am insanely impressed in the quality of
this compared to the last palette I
reviewed obviously so bright the back
I'm just already like cool because I
would have been so sad if it was repeat
I would have been so devastated but I
knew that it wouldn't be because I
definitely think that Anasazi has brand
is one of the brands that cares to like
listen even though they didn't take it
well when the reviews are rolling in the
bad reviews of subculture
I think they listen and they try to
improve it I cannot say that about a lot
of brands so I can respect them for that
so yeah that is it for this video hope
you guys enjoyed the review on the two
new Anastacio
products a lot of you guys wanted me to
get the contour shades but I just want
to keep it really simple they want to
buy too much and also I didn't know what
shade to get so I kind of just left that
alone but if you guys want to see me use
it I can try to pick it up hopefully
when it's in Sephora so I'm actually
able to see the shades I don't know if
it's in there yet but I can try that but
let me know what other things you guys
want me to review here on my channel and
I'll go purchase it and get it done but
other than that thank you guys so much
for watching and I'll see you guys in my
next video peace out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
