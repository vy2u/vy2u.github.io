have just got done filming this makeup
look for you guys and then I will on the
Twitter and Twitter wants and anti ha
I'll wrap our microphones too close to
me okay let's see if that works better
so I yeah I'm on Twitter and a lot will
one in anti hall and I don't know start
this so I'm not sure I claim best artist
I guess an anti hall is basically a haul
video of things that you're not going to
buy and a lot of you have been doing it
and basically this just like our way of
telling you like hey we're not going to
buy this so um yeah I'm going to do that
day I have my notes because I did write
down a bunch of things I don't grab
buying it's not a lot of stuff but I'll
explain why I don't want to buy each
thing that's on the anti at all
I'm out of breath you're healthier
what's up okay so we go ahead and get
series and by the way this is not a disk
to any of these companies I'm just I'm
not a malicious person so like I just
yeah I'm not like oh yeah like no
sabotage that's men who I am just like
to add that disclaimer I know some
companies like to take up PR lists if
you say anything bad about them so if
you do that to me the next is your law
school I'm a walking chick but what
assess me if you're lost I'm amazing
okay but let's get started okay whatever
alright the first thing um don't really
write that on the first of all the first
the first thing on my list is the hooter
Beauty I mean honestly I don't want to
buy anything movie I mean literally on
my list regards lapkus is huda beauty
anything because I don't know it's hard
to explain my stand on that or my stance
on that and maybe it's changed remember
um this is a while ago actually so maybe
it has changed but a while ago I noticed
a trend kind of on her page and that
trend was that it seemed to me that she
didn't necessarily post any
women of color makeup artist and own
time she would post them is when
basically the video was like a joke or
like just an embarrassing video or video
where it wasn't seen nothing but hate
calm so just kind of one of those videos
guys it wasn't like a basically she was
opposed to equality like it's so hard to
explain and I mean me and a couple other
people would notice it and I just it
rubbed me the wrong way after that
become okay like why can't you post like
respectable artists and I don't know
like if it's rubbing the wrong way and I
kind of noticed I didn't really like
that I mean maybe it's changed by the
time that's what I notice about her feet
is okay like whenever she posed I mean
that's a lot of pages that used to that
honestly they would only post like
basically black artists whenever it was
like a joke or jokes videos like never
serious artistry and irritated makes us
like dude like we're passe like we be
even tougher so at the time I kind of
just like okay she's canceled in my mind
in the group and you know I had a few
people tell me that they want to review
that palette just come with a
highlighter palette but you would not do
that for me because I don't want to give
her money so I mean I just
oh no surprise there would be some
interesting to me like just to be
completely honest even if she I mean
yeah even if what I was explained wasn't
a certain chance her prawns don't just
seem really interesting to me so no for
me out elbows it's a no for me next
product that I talk about that would not
be line is the tarts unicorn collection
and I'm sure like a fun tool so they're
not gonna buy it and honestly the reason
I'm gonna buy is because I mean it just
doesn't really seem appealing to me I
mean I get that unicorns are like in
right now I mean my background kind of
like unicorn vibe but age doesn't really
seem that pleasing to me it doesn't seem
like a me that I need personally like oh
wow I really want to brag on and get
that I'm not feeling that from that and
on some speaking if you noticed on me on
my channel the only thing tart that I
use is their shape a concealer and
they're blending sponge because I found
in the past that usually their
eyeshadows turn up great on my skin tone
and I don't like old and gray you know
like I want to look honorable so a lot
of their stuff turns gray on me
personally the only things that work for
me is the chasing concealer or take
shape shape to it whatever it's called
and the little quickie blending sponge I
love those products but everything else
that I have tried and tart I'm just not
really like oh my god you know like I
mean I've tried some lip products and
those okay that's a little lip gloss
I've tried that and that was pretty but
in terms of just like other stuff Torche
is not everything one of those brands
that I go to Sephora or okay and I'm
like oh let me go to the tart stand
kiosk you know like I'm snot like you
know like I'm giving you my heart card
you know like so I probably will say
with matte collection because I'd rather
see my money so yeah that's a no for me
see you next on my list we have the
Urban Decay Basquiat collection and yeah
I don't blend yeah yeah no that's a no
for me and I mean okay it's not that
deep I guess it's not a deep but to me
oh wait let me just go ahead and confirm
because maybe maybe things have changed
maybe that was just one campaign shot so
let's look at it which is confirmed yeah
nothing's changed to me honestly
speaking when I see the Basquiat
campaign I've seen tone-deaf and I'm
just like honestly for that specific
campaign I just personally wish that
they would have gotten like a black
model and I mean that is my personal
opinion on it and I mean escort guy
wanted like two political or two you
know like deep into it but to me I'm
like come on fucking bastia you know
like come on man like it just irritated
me and it's like you know like I'm a
huge Basquiat BAM like I've watched
documentaries you know like are we have
a t-shirt you know like I love Basquiat
but to me when I put my campaign I'm
like are you for real right now like I
like summer vacay stuff of that
collection I'm staying away from because
to me it's just like really I would have
you know I would have loved to see a
different campaign for that and I mean
he'll if you go to the comments on that
frickin post of the
yeah yeah everyone is pretty like
they're like disrespectful disgrace no a
lot of people thought that would have
been a perfect opportunity for them to
just add a little bit more
representation and you know just kind of
cast a black model for the Basquiat
shoes and you know I would have loved
that as well and that's my reasoning
behind not wanting it and honestly it
doesn't really look that pleasing to me
like the colors you know like it doesn't
really something that I would buy or
want so I'm going to go and stay away
from it and yeah especially myself on
that I just ended because of campaigns a
little bit differently so just that
whole kind of campaign alone I'm like
okay like I'm going to pass on this
collection and it just doesn't really
look that appealing to me a lot of
things I'm mentioning it's like they
have other reasons behind why I do not
want to get it and that's why I'm
explaining but also the product itself
just does not look interesting to me so
I don't want you guys think that oh you
know basically elicit is what doesn't
wanna buy these for your feelings like
no it's my feelings plus it doesn't look
good to me because I mean there's some
products right I mean I have feelings
but I'm like you look really good you
know legs I'm gonna get you and I get it
but I mean if it's the two combined then
I'm like okay like there's no doubt
about I'm not going to give this product
moving on the next thing that I am NOT
going to get is the Kylie and Kim
collaborations a little Kim's news
basically I'm going to get that I mean
this is really simple
they look fucking boring like that
collections look so boring I was like
are you kidding me I mean what is it
like for news I stopped making it did so
much better could just so much more I
know Kim loved the news but like no pun
intended I just think that was just so
dry it looks dry as hell and honestly I
don't think that they will look good on
my skin tone at all I think that that's
more meant for like a lighter complexion
for sure unless you get into pear with a
brown lip liner but it's like who wants
to go through all that I liked my news
to be for me that look good and to me
those news you don't look like they look
good on me into the boring collection
and honestly I kind of stopped buying
Kylie's products told that it was the
holiday collection because they just
kind of that boring because are boring
to me like well when I went to go look
at the site it's like the collection
didn't sell out so I think that their
height is kind of dying down anyway just
people realizing there are other
products out there that are more
affordable that are for more respected
brands that kind of care low anymore and
don't always have F up and they would
rather buy that and I kind of feel the
same way where it's like Kylie her brand
is always having mistakes from the want
the people not having freakin full
lipsticks or empty you know like there's
always some little errors so maybe I
mean she'll get it together in the
future but I just don't like buying it
or stuff I didn't buy the highlights
didn't buy the Valentine's Day stuff I'm
just not interested in this collection
in particular I was like no Liz boring
moving on though for me dogs and then
the last thing I have on my list is the
Too Faced and candy Johnson collab and
and my candy she's super cool I met her
in person she's super awesome but I
think that we can all take a look at
this palette and say wow we've seen that
before from Too Faced Lee's 20 times
already and that is me be honest and I
want to face PR list you know like so I
mean I don't know of me saying is they
give me boot it off but I think that the
palette just looks like something that
we've seen before him in like it's a
joke honestly like at a different color
or you know make it more vibrant because
to me candy just seems more vibrant make
it more fitting to her I just from the
palette looks absolutely boring
it looks like recycled shapes at Too
Faced always uses and I know that
two-face has their own little vibe every
brand has their vibe and they kind of go
with the same kind of flow but at the
same time if I switch it up because the
palette looks really boring and looks
and looks like every other toothpaste
toothpaste base and looks like every
other Too Faced palette that we've seen
before so I'm prom save my points and
he'll that's not out yet
that's a meal literally out in September
but they decide to relaunch and that
relaunch it announced it whatever the
words look for announce it now but yeah
I do not plan behind that in September
because it just looks like what we've
seen before and
rather save my money so that is it for
this little video if you guys want this
often where ever there's like new
launches let me know I mean a little bit
nervous posters because I hope if you
will aren't like mad at me for not
wanting to get stuff like these are my
opinions and it was actually kind of
cool talking about my opinions because I
never do that on my channel I'm never
very vocal whenever I ask awesome stuff
I kind of keep to myself a little bit
surprised because I hate debating like
I'm sitting too tired too tired to
debate and you know I just don't even
feel like it so I know that you know
like yes I just try to be drama-free
drama-free
but I hope you guys liked this kind of
video if you did be sure to give it a
thumbs up and I will see you guys the
next video which is probably this makeup
looks because I really like how it
turned out and I want to upload it so
I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
