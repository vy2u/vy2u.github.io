you are new welcome today's video is
going to be on this eye makeup look that
you see right here and I'm excited to be
working with Revlon on this video and
I'll be using their new colors stay
exact by liquid liner to create this
look now if you've been subscribed for a
while I'm sure you guys we call a video
that I made a couple of months back and
I reviewed a product that is really
similar to the exact fi liquid liner
however if you want to purchase it back
then and you're like okay like I don't
really want to dish out this much money
this liner is a great alternative and
it's actually a fraction of the cost and
it comes in different shades so that's
pretty cool as well and here the shades
for you guys
you have intense black which is the one
I use on my eyes today you have
sparkling black which is similar to
black but with the hint of pink shimmer
you have mulberry which is also what I
use today and lastly you have mermaid
blue which is not your standard teal
those are the shades that the liner's
come in and I'm quite excited to show
you guys this look that I got right here
because I really like how it turned out
so if you guys want to see this look
then just keep on watching and I hope
you guys enjoy it okay so as you can see
I already have one eye done
that one's a go and the other one is a
new well okay it's not really a no but
we got to get to it to complete the look
first I'm gonna take the Revlon
Colorstay cream eyeshadow and this is
number seven 20 and I'm gonna go cymbal
with the shadow today because I want the
focus to be the liner so I'm taking the
shades 7 20 and then I'm gonna pack on a
little bit of 7:15 because it has a
slight shimmer to it and I thought that
would go great with the look and then
I'm gonna pop 705 in the inner corner
just for a pop now to the liner the star
of the show and here is it close up it
is a roller wheel liner and I kind of
live for these they're really really
cool so and as you can see it's all nice
and sharp
and then look at this you guys it
literally does not budge it does not
budge it stays put so it's really cool
let's go ahead and apply it now taking
the color stay exact if I liquid liner
and this is intense black I'm just going
to work on my wing I like to start on
the actual
part itself because since my eyes are
hooded that part is the most challenging
for me so I like to knock it out so I
can feel confident for the rest of the
wing so as you can see I'm just taking
the aligner and I'm just gliding it
across I'm not angling it because you
want to have it directly on the eyes you
can get the sharpest line possible you
do not want to angle it because you may
get too much and you also want to avoid
applying too much pressure because it's
not needed you just want to glide across
your eye and create your little
beautiful wing because the applicator
allows for a very easy application with
practice and with time and then on top
of that I'm gonna take exacta Phi in the
shade mulberry and I'm just going to
apply it it's a very nice maroon with
slight shimmer and I just think it's
perfect for the fall season and that's
why I went very light on the eye shadow
because I really wanted to pop so I'm
just gonna apply it until I'm satisfied
with it and we're gonna have a pop and
we yes then going back in with mulberry
and I'm gonna apply this to the inner
part of the eye just to tie it in with
the top part of the eye and then I'm
also gonna take intense black and exacta
Phi and I'm going to put this on the
outer part of the eye and I found that
this little method really opened on my
eyes a lot and now to finish off the eye
look I'm gonna take Revlon's mega
multiplier mascara in the shade blackest
black and I am just coating my top
lashes with this mascara and I'm also
going to put a little bit on the bottom
not too much but just a little bit and
then here is how the eye looks and this
is optional but I went ahead and applied
some falsies and I applied more mascara
because it blends really well with the
falsies and then here we have my final
eye look as you can see the mulberry
eyeliner looks beautiful and I loved it
so yeah here's the eye and then we're
gonna finish off with some lips this is
Revlon Super Lustrous lipstick in the
shade in pearl
now on top of that I'm gonna take
forever Long's kiss plumping lip cream
in the shade barely blush just to add
more of a pop because you guys know I
love my little pout and then that's the
finished look I hope you guys loved how
this look turned out be sure to check
the description box for all details on
everything I use and if you happen to
grab one of the Revlon Colorstay exact
apply liquid liners and try it out
know your thoughts and show me your
looks but other than that thank you guys
so much for watching and I'll see you
guys soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
