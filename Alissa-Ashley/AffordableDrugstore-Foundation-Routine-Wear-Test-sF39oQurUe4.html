today's video is going to be on a
foundation routine that is both
drugstore / portable and I decided to do
it a little bit different this video
because I feel like in my other previous
drugstore / affordable routines they
were slain full but you guys didn't
really get to see how it wore throughout
the day the final results after about
six eight hours you guys need to see
that and I feel like when it comes to
affordable and drugstore makeup looks
that's the main question asked how long
did last how long do wear because
typically speaking sometimes higher in
makeup lasts longer
so a lot people want to know okay how
did it last so I decided to block
throughout my day as I was out in this
hot-ass weather and just show you guys
how it was wearing and then after I'm
done I'm going to come back and let you
guys see at the end how it held up so if
you want to see my routine then just
keep on watching I actually did this
routine for the last like six days just
trying out new items and really trying
to perfect it to make sure that I got a
routine that lasted pretty decently so
I'm pretty happy with how it turned out
so yeah without further ado let's just
jump into this video okay so let's get
started
ignore the hair I decided to not put
anything in it for now I'm just
conditioning it while I do my makeup
instead of splitting it down they can
make a fall to my hairline all that
stuff the first thing we do is take my
Ruby kisses primers the never touch up
face primer and this is the blemish
sweep and I'm just gonna place this and
the areas where I normally get oily just
for extra assurance I feel like when it
comes to my makeup and this is just with
any routine high-end low-end
I always end up getting oily on my nose
I can prime it but it always ends up
getting oily no matter what and I've
kind of gotten used to it because it
just produces more oil than anything
else in my face but I just tried to
minimize it I used to not prime
whatsoever and I'll just be a mess but
now I prime so it's not as bad the next
thing I'm going to do is take these NYX
mineral stick foundations
these are the shades 9 and 10 and I am
loving these they're only $10 and I
think that's amazing so I'm just going
to go ahead and just apply a couple of
little wherever you call those streaks
to my face I mix them because one them
is too light or the other ones too dark
so I feel like mix them together D is my
perfect shade so that was number nine is
number 10 I'm going to go ahead and
blend out this foundation with the
morphe 31 brush I'm just moving it
around if you want a more sheer finished
furry foundation use a Beauty Blender
but if you want more of a better
coverage use like a nice buffer brush
like this brush right here
I met with their Manor on my nose okay
so now to move on to my highlighting I'm
going to take the L'Oreal True Match
concealer and the Maybelline instant age
rewind and I'm going to take the age
rewind first this is a shade medium and
I'm just going to sponge underneath my
eye up three little dots and it's pretty
full coverage so don't go too crazy like
I am right now and I'm paying the
L'Oreal True Match I'm gonna do the same
thing just place it right on top and I
go ahead and blend this in with my Real
Techniques sponge I'm blending out your
concealers you want to make sure that
your sponge is nice and damp not too
damp nothing too crazy because if it's
too damp also do is just pick up that
product but damp enough now for my
under-eye I'm just gonna take my finger
and just kind of blend it out a little
bit all right in my eye first next I'm
gonna go ahead and apply my Ruby kisses
three-face create and I'm an appliance
with the Ruby kisses foundation brush
and the brushes are pretty new and as
you can see mine is kind of dirty
because I've been using it to apply this
3d face create a kind of like they work
well together and I'm just kind of going
in between both of the shades and
getting an even amount of product on
both ends of the brush and I'm just go
ahead and just carve out those
cheekbones I feel like this is the best
drugstore affordable cream contour
product I've ever used ever I feel like
it's actually better than some of my
high-end stuff I feel like it's extreme
comparable to the Make Up For Ever Ultra
HD foundation stick but better because
that one is a little bit too amoliant
for me this one is nice and it's creamy
but it's not slippery that make any
sense I hope that make sense so I really
do like this stuff and then before
blending out the contour my cheeks I'm
gonna go ahead and just blend in this
concealer
now it's time to set my highlighted
areas and for this i'll be using the
maybelline shine free powder and this in
the shade medium and I'm also going to
mix in some of my Sasha Buttercup powder
the reason I decide to mix them is
because my highlight is pretty bright
and I feel like mixing in the Sasha
which has a lot of yellow in it is going
to tone it down so they go ahead and
just blend out any possible creasing
first and switch over to another Real
Techniques sponge and then just pounce
that powder into the highlighted area
and then like always I'm just going to
sweep away that first layer of powder
and I'm gonna apply a second layer just
to bake a little bit
and then I'm still going to use the same
powder but it's mainly just the shine
free powder and not so much
Sasha Buttercup and I'm going to take
this morphe one brush and what I like to
do is well I have my powder and my cap
here to want to spill it I'm just going
to pack the powder onto my face and then
I buff it away and this gives me a very
very nice airbrushed finish this just
how I like to do it I know it may seem
cakey but it's really not you're
actually buffing away a lot of the power
that you just applied but you're just
making sure you get a really nice layer
onto your skin to get a nice airbrushed
finish next I'm gonna take my black
radiance soft focus finishing powder and
this in the shade milk chocolate finish
and this is a Ruby kisses large powder
brush and I'm just going to sweep it
across the product dust off the excess
and then just chisel my cheekbones and
I'm moving my brush upwards I don't want
to drag it down too low because then
it's going to look really really harsh
and then you just want to blend it away
once you have most that product off your
brush
and then for my nose I'm going to take
this morphe 49 brush do the same thing
dust it off even more and I'm going to
sweep across my nose and then for blush
I'm gonna go ahead and take this makeup
geek summer fling blush and then for my
highlight of course I'm gonna take my
Ruby kisses all over glow bronzing
powder and this is in light glow and I'm
gonna go ahead and just set my face in
place with this Ruby kisses never touch
up setting spray and just find something
to fan myself to help speed up this
drying process and I go ahead and just
done some brows lashes and look oh and
I'll be right back okay so I makeup is
done it is now 2:45 so we're just gonna
see how I lash of the day I wish I don't
have this damn welt but it's my freakin
Fox I didn't list of instruction so it's
whatever I'm sure it won't really make a
difference in the wear of anything so
we're just to see how it goes I'm not
gonna touch it up whatsoever I really
just want to see how it lasts so talk to
you outside all righty so it is when I
was it for 17c so what it would close
how's it coming
they did your Nashville way who was I
with when the cupcake interface of a
pancake
things are nil it was you right yeah is
a pancake
yeah okay so it's been about
oh it's for 18 where am i we're able to
think oh my god and the foundation is
wearing pretty well okay it's going to
change because this campus real cool and
it brightens whenever in dark areas but
it's been lasting pretty well make sure
you get some shots let's go back outside
we're just before do we do all right
good lighting so far no oiling oiling it
looks at the weird word so far
everything looks the same just say
exactly what you like airbrush yes okay

their behalf of my blue bed I'll be home
soon so I guess I'll be checking in from
my Canada not my little blog myself
I'll see you guys then okay so I'm back
home now it is now 6:45 so it's been
about four hours and this is how
everything is looking so far and damn
wealth is still there so frustrating but
I feel like the face itself is really
really really holding up as you can see
in my little vlog someone gave me a
compliment they were like wow looks
beautiful and I made her like saying I
care because I want you guys to see that
it really looks good especially to be so
affordable so I feel like four hours is
still a short amount of time so I'm
going to keep it on for a little bit
longer I don't really have anywhere else
to go so I'm just gonna be chilling in
my house yeah I guess I'll check with
you guys in about a couple hours now
9:20 to show you guys my screen it's
9:22 right now and I was going to try to
keep this on until fear please the
makeup overall looks pretty damn good to
me I'm like so irritated with my little
welts I wish I would have used the
device that I'm using and actually read
the instruction so that didn't but
that's my fault but other than that the
makeup looks absolutely amazing in my
opinion especially compared to the other
few days that I was trying and
experimenting with different products
and yeah I was a grease monkey at this
point I'm the day but right now I feel
like the only area that's a little bit
dewy your greasy is around my nose area
but everything else is fine it looks
basically how it looked when I first put
it on and I was out of the Sun the whole
days so I'm really impressed with this
routine and I hope you guys liked the
overall video and if you do decide to
try out any of the products I use please
let me know how they work out for you
and if you want to see me try out any
other products in like vlogs of the day
and all that stuff let me know because
it was pretty fun so yes hope you guys

give it a thumbs up and I'll see you
