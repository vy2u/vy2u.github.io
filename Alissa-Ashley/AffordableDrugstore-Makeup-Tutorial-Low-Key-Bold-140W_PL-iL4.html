today's tutorial is going to be on this
look that you see right here and I'm
really excited about this tutorial
because it is an all affordable makeup
tutorial and I feel like I haven't did
one of these in a couple of tutorials so
I'm really excited because I know that
sometimes I use some pretty pricey
things but I am here to let you know
that you don't got to spin it a lot of
coins to slay so I try to do for you
guys and I honestly just sat down I
didn't really have a plan I just got on
with the flow and it was a little bit
scary because usually I haven't planned
but I really like how it turned out so I
hope you guys like it as well if you do
be sure to give it a thumbs up and let
me know what else you would like to see
you guys want to see some fun and
colorful summer tutorials at a drugstore
let me know other than that there's
something being here and thank you so
much for watching and I'll see you guys
soon and let's just get into this
tutorial okay so let's go ahead and get
started the first thing we do is take my
Maybelline fit me foundation this is
dewy + smooth it is in the shade 330 I
think this is like my perfect match I
used to have to mix with the matte
foundation but I found the matte
foundation oxidized on me a little bit
of the matte + poor matte poreless but
this one works perfectly by itself I'm
pleased by it so and I'm going to blend
this in with a real techniques sponge
next I'm gonna take my L'Oreal True
Match concealer I'm just applying this
wherever our highlight you guys know the
drill
man I should have tried that dammit god
damn you guys I bought the freaking
Revlon conceal if I have made a try yet
hold on let me grab it put this on -
because I really want to try it okay
interesting color it's more on the olive
tone side and this is going to shade
fahncy okay I really want to try it I
bought it like freakin forever ago and I
have Nabal to try it so let's just see
how they mix together okay so now to set
my face and let me just say this
Maybelline shine free powder last hella
long because I've gone through about two
to three Laura Mercier powders but this
at five for at least two months and it
still got some juice in it so I'm going
to be using that today and I'm going to
take a little bit of the medium shade
and for me and I just ones a lot I
contoured that's really weird made a
couple too much highlight on dangly Nora
and then I'm gonna take the light shade
and a light actually looks like a really
light banana shade and I'm gonna mix
them together I don't want to just go in
with the light because it's my first
time really using it so I just don't
over to expect so I'm just kind of
shaking it together and I'm going to use
that to set my under eye
I'd dust it away hey pretty nice I like
mix them together okay cool and go ahead
do the other eye
and I'm going to take the medium powder
by itself I'm saying more feet to brush
and just set my face I'd like to just
kind of get the powder nice and on there
first
I know it looks crazy but it's hell
effective I look flawless okay and then
I just dust it away I have to have all
that powder on I liked over powdering
and then dusting off the excess because
I feel like it gives me a nice
airbrushed finish if I don't put enough
powder I feel like I just don't look
great I don't know it's really hard to
explain if you wanted like a more
in-depth tutorial let me know and I'll
just kind of act my brain to help me out
of it and explain to you guys but I
think it's pretty easy to understand now
go ahead and just bronze up my skin I'm
taking the black radiance press powder
and this is cafe and I take a morphe III
brush I'm trying to use affordable
brushes as well in case you have noticed
and then of course I have taken my
morphe m-52 for brush my nose contour
that's a must
for blush I'm taking my morphe blush
palette this is a nine in and let me go
ahead and take a lighter color I did
last time last time I did the most out
the coolant crap was so pigmented and I
was under estimating it so you only take
a light shade and then yeah okay I'll
work okay so I went ahead and brought
you guys in the Lowe's more honestly I
don't even know it look I'm gonna do
we're gonna go flow here I'm gonna take
the Knicks the Knicks came and frame
tinted brow pomade and this in the shade
chocolate and I'm gonna go ahead and
just fill in my brows I think it's like
my second time using this product so I
forgot how I felt about it I guess we're
going to find out today
let me go ahead and just conceal and
then for my base today I'm going to take
the NYX eyeshadow base and this is
number three I take a more ve 27 brush
just to apply it
it's a little bit more sticky than the
prior coaching so I have to kind of
blend it in my finger I'm a set in place
per usual okay so now for the eye shadow
and I was being completely serious when
I said I don't have a plan uh so I'm
trying to go to blow here I'm gonna take
a morphe oh geez they're all stressed
out I think this is a more be 3:30 brush
it's really fluffy and I'm going to take
the morphe 35o palette gonna take this
shade right here and just place it into
my eye the star up kind of soft is I
really don't know what's going
whatsoever
and then I'm going to take this morphine
oh Jesus
I've had all these brushes for so long
they're all scratched up I know for sure
this is a b8ed ad
I'm going with the deeper shade and just
continue to build this up I really don't
know what is it come out like we're
gonna figure it out now to go in with a
more feet in 507 and I'm gonna go ahead
and take a deep brown keep deep it up
next I'm taking me more feet 35f I'm
going to take some Mack mixing medium
liner and I just pop I actually use
about two to three colors just kind of
create the color that you see on the
right side I just want something more
coppery I put a gold down first and the
gold was gorgeous but it wasn't really
what I was aiming for and then I put a
brown down Brandon
and I will go ahead and create a nice
little wing with the NYX matte liquid
liner
relax I'm taking these ardell lashes by
Dropbox I don't know where they are but
they're really thin and lightweight and
I'm putting these on because I'm a put
on the second pair but I kind of want to
like see where I'm kind of heading with
this look
then I take 35 F and a morphine 19 brush
and I'm just gonna highlight my brow
bone your my little inner corner
highlight
and that's going to pop brown eye shadow
in the inner corner on the last line I'm
going to take the e19 brush to do that
and I'm going to pop a little bit of
shimmer in the inner corner
and I'm going to take this la girl gel
glide glide gel liner is the black when
I'm just gonna placed in the waterline
for highlight I'm taking room because
it's all over
Bronco all over Chlo bronzing powder and
this is a light glow I'm gonna take my
morphe import 3/8 brush it's my first
time using it so I kinda just want to
see how it looks
that's a very subtle highlight
I'm good with very so you guys know me
well yeah actually actually like how
subtle it is mmm it doesn't look crazy I
feel like with some just raw
highlighters once you look this way you
can kind of see it kind of sitting on
your face it's not doing that whatsoever
that is that's crazy it's great I think
it's on your favorite mm-hmm and then
from lip color I know that if I use a
nude you guys want to kill me so I'm
going to take this NYX liquid suede and
this is club hopper and I apply this on
my lips and the last thing I do is go
ahead and set it in place and I'm gonna
take the L'Oreal infallible okay so
here's the finished look and can I just
say I am hella feeling this look you
guys I really am and the reason why I'm
just like so juiced is because as I was
doing this I was just like mmm I don't
know I was in the end up and I just my
mojo has been off ladies I'm psyched
this thing will go over too well but I
like it I really like it
everything is working out so I hope you
guys like this look I hope I'm not just
filling myself for no reason other than
that thank you so much for watching and
yeah it's about to get really slow most
I'm about to do the most let's go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
