today's look is going to be a 100%
drugstore makeup look and I'm really
excited about it because I know you guys
have been wanting more affordable looks
because I use some expensive products I
understand how that could be a little
bit frustrating because it's not really
realistic all the time so I decided to
use all drugs from a kit for you guys
the eye look was inspired by look I did
about four weeks ago but that look was
much more intense and though you guys
loved it and I loved it too I feel like
I've seen tutorials on the look already
after posting it so I didn't want to be
repetitive or that kind of thing it's
already out in the universe so I decide
to make mine a little more daytime
wearable as opposed to super dramatic
and I really like how came out I loved
it I absolutely loved it so if you guys
liked it as well also I did try some new
products based on you guys's
recommendations and some of them were
fails
others worked up great so we will just
see that in the tutorial other than that
that is it for my intro hope you guys
like the video if you do be sure to
subscribe and give this video a thumbs
up and let's get tutorial okay so the
first thing to do is go ahead and pry my
skin i'm using the loreal paris magic
perfecting base I picked this up last
night
so I've never used before it got mixed
reviews but it had a four point one to
four point four stars so then it's
pretty good it's okay so I'm gonna go
ahead and just dig my nail it in I feel
like they give you a very small amount
but maybe it just spreads so we're going
to see also forgive me if you can hear
that out there if we can cut the
graph Saburo which I do
just leave the grass on kept its way
okay you all right
this is pretty good a little bit more on
I really don't like silicone II type
filling primers but this one doesn't
feel too so cold so we're just going to
see how it affects my makeup
for foundation I'm using the Revlon
Colorstay foundation actually doesn't
Instagram what is your favorite
drugstore foundation I won't turn me
gray and a lot of people said Revlon
I've never tried it before I'm in the
shade 400 caramel at least what I think
so we're just going on heaven I put on
my face I'm hoping it matches and we're
taking my Jew vyas place flat buffer
brush to blend it out okay so the
coverage feels very nice I feel like it
may be a little bit too dark
hmm oh boy yeah that's really dark um
you see I could fix this for what it's
worth
oh my god crazy for what it's worth it
feels very well and covered very well
and I might have to just go and buy a
bottle that's like one shade lighter to
mix it up together and I'll let you guys
know how that works
I'm going to take another foundation
that's the lightest one I own and try to
blend that in to fix this situation I
don't want to take oh I don't want to
take the Revlon off because I want to
see what it feels like if it breaks me
out so I gotta mix another foundation
you guys see how crazy I look so I hope
you guys forgive me let's just fix this
okay so I hope I fix it enough but we're
gonna panic and feel and everything to
see how it all comes together I'm take
the L'Oreal True Match super blendable
concealer and this isn't new to me I've
used it quite a few times and I really
love it like this the best drugstore
concealer that I personally used as well
as the Maybelline age rewind concealer
but this one's bombed too
I'll go ahead and blend out the Real
Techniques sponge and do koncham I take
my Ruby kisses 3d face creator in level
15 and this is even drugstore this is
like Beauty Supplies daughter and I love
love love this product actually how to
use in a while because the freaking cat
broke off of it
and you know just mess after that all my
other makeup got on it
and this is a dubious place contour
brush
then we'll send my face with my
Maybelline shine-free powder let me go
ahead and set the rest of my face with
that powder as well first thing we do is
do my brows I'm taking the NYX tame and
frank tinted brow pomade this in the
shade chocolate now I did this bra over
here and I just found that for it to be
named chocolate it's pretty cool tone
you got to see in a second to go ahead
and fill morale in and then go ahead and
take the NYX micro brow pencil and this
is chocolate as well I always get
chocolate products I feel like those are
the best ones
and this is so cool Tana went ahead took
a warm eyeshadow on top of it just to
make a little bit darker and a little
more warm tone to conceal and highlight
them take the Loreal so we're blendable
concealer I use it on my eye and I'm
going to take my nizzle leave a two to
six smudger brush just to blend it out
you
go ahead and set that my maybelline
shine free powder okay so for IOSH i'm
going to take the nyx ultimate shadow
palette this is not sponsored by NYX by
the way I just like their products with
a pretty affordable and they're good for
what they're worth
and this is number three I'm going to
take this shade right here it's a nice
orange shade dust that off and then I'm
just going to place that in my crease
area
I'm going to take this light shade right
here
just to kind of soften everything up a
bit I'm going to take this Maroney shade
in the palette I take the same softener
shade in that one shade I use first just
to really really soften that color out
I'm also going to place that moon shade
on my lid as well next I will take the
NYX glitter primer and a lot of you guys
are asking me if it's similar to the Mac
mixing medium liner it is in the sense
that it will keep your shadows on your
lid without transferring but it's a
different consistency it's a little bit
thicker so I feel like it changes the
texture of the pigments a little bit too
much for my liking but it does its job
for what it's worth and it's a pretty
affordable dupe and I'm gonna take this
cranberry type shade over here it's nice
and cheery and place that right on top
I'll go ahead and take that same maroon
shade and place it underneath and I'm
going to take that orange e transition
shade and just kind of soften up a bit
nothing too extreme go ahead and apply
some lashes these ardell lashes in the
number 113 I did cut them and if you
want to see my last video I have that
link down below so you can learn about
cutting your lashes and making them work
out for your eye shape while I'm drawing
them I take my L'Oreal voluminous o
curved brush I'm just like wise this
this other language curve and brush
mascara and I'm pretty pissed off
because I just got the black brown shade
I want to get black but it's whatever I
complain
now to add some warmth to my face
finally I'm going to take the L'Oreal
True Match super blendable powder and
this in the shade
c6 and I love this powder
they go ahead smash the nose let's help
that up too too much because it's power
so break it like pigmented so whenever I
try to contour my nose with it it just
looks like a absolute disaster for blush
I'm taking the Maybelline master contour
kit and it looks kind of shimmery first
time using it looks kind of shimmery I
don't know how I'm gonna feel about it
exactly it'll do
and then for highlight I'm also going to
take this little kit and let's see how
this works and this is I think this is
the darker one by the way again number
two cuz it's not number one I can't
mhmmm that would not work out
for lips and then you go surprise sick
of Cimiez my roasted coffee lip pencil
so I'm not gonna use that I'm gonna take
the Milani covet liquid lipstick it's
the more matte liquid lipstick or lip
cream everyone call it go ahead
hi that I shouldn't try talking my
blinders
and I'm going to take their shade
adorable they finally had in stock last
night at Walmart so I instagrammed one
Platinum Center
and if Iceland was missing so I add in
my little inner corner highlight I used
the same NYX palette I use this little
shade up here which is actually very pop
it and really really nice and bright and
then lastly I'm going to take the
L'Oreal infallible Pro spray and set
this is new to me and someone on
snapchat they told me be sure to check
it or you get like white spots
everyone's like okay some shake my life
I don't want that
go ahead so here's the finished look I
really hope you guys like how it turned
out
I'm loving it I feel like everything
kind of matches well together in fact
this all drugstore
that's bomb so be sure to follow my
Instagram because I will be giving you
guys an update on how it wore throughout
the date because like always drugs or
makeup you never know if it's gonna last
how's that last a comparison to high-end
makeup so I will be sure to update you
guys on that other than that thank you
so much for watching the slow moves it
won't be a part I think that that's
everyone's a part I wonder if anyone
hates them I'm really can't hate them
you've got to go watch them right now
I'll see you guys soon
