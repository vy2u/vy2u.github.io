so today's video is going to be me
trying out a new method as you can see I
already have one eyelash on because I
was practicing okay so let me just okay
let me just do the intro and then little
stop poking crazy war mash on but there
was a video circulating on Instagram I'm
sure you guys saw it a lot of people DM
me telling me Alyssa try out this method
and at first I kept getting comments
saying oh you should do it where you put
the lash under your eye I was like like
what are you guys doing like well what's
going on and I saw the video I was like
oh I get it now at first I was like what
the hell they told me to do it sounds
dangerous
but I watched the video over and over
again and I sighs tried myself and kind
of just give my verdict on whether I
think it's worth the hassle and all that
good stuff so if you want to see me try
this out and it's gonna be a little bit
difficult not gonna lie to you it'll be
difficult to try to yeah zubi zubi
difficult cuz it's really hard to do it
so if you want to see me try this out
and give you my ruling on how I feel
about it then just keep on watching okay
so I went ahead and brought you guys in
closer obviously because we're doing
some ice stuff and I want you to see it
the so for this experiment I'm going to
be using the Lily lashes in the style
opulence and I'm choosing these because
the hairs of it and I'm glad to show you
guys real quick the hairs of it are very
very tiny so I just I don't know I had a
feeling that this will look the best and
not um all crazy and it'll be easy
because the lash band is very thin so
what I'm going to do is I'm going to cut
it in about okay first I'm gonna take it
on my eye with my lash tweezers and
we'll go ahead and just kind of see
where oh god I'm gonna drop it first I
will go ahead and see where my eye
curves because we're pricing on the
other eye I found that it's easier to
divide it by the curve of your eye
because yeah it's hard to get it under
there it's really freakin hard so I'm
going to cut it about right here just I
can have some for the inner part and a
little bit of that mane
my eye so go ahead and cut these in half
it's easier because I noticed that in
the video she also did two part of Lee
and also I tried to do it as a whole
strip and yeah no don't do that because
it's really difficult so I'm go ahead
and cut off half of the lash talk about
this much left
look you guys didn't see it have about
that much lash okay the first things
first we'll go ahead and apply some
mascara this is a pure fully charged
mascara get my lashes nice and black and
I'm also going to make sure to not clump
up that mascara I don't want to thick of
a coat of mascara because then it's just
going to be harder to blend and these
lashes seem to match the thickness of my
lash hairs when applying mascara which
is why these are the best fit so she
used a lash curler but my lashes are
pretty curled ups I don't think I need
one if your lashes are more straight
down then definitely use one because if
they really tricky getting under there
okay be tricky okay so I camera if I
mention or not but with this method it's
important to have both hands on deck and
I learned that thanks I learned that by
doing this I it's extremely difficult to
only use one hand because you want to
use one of your hands to lift the eye
and the other ones apply lash I'll go
ahead and take the lash the longer part
that I cut off I'm going to take my
House of lashes lash glue I'm go ahead
and apply a very thin layer of glue and
I'll wait about 30 seconds to a minute
for it to get tacky you want to make
sure it's tacky because if you're
applying it when it's very liquidy it's
just going to slip around and make in
your eye and it may sting and burn you
do not want that so just wait to be
patient for it to get tacky okay so once
your glue is nice and tacky this could
be tricky you want to go ahead and okay
it's really hard cut comparing to my
mirror I'm going to go ahead and lift up
your eye whoo and place the lash right
on the very ends of your last year
there oh wow this is really tricky
ah
this is really really tricky okay so you
gotta be patient with this method okay
so the lash is under there you grab my
mirror
whoa push the lash upwards okay we're
getting somewhere
Oh keep pushing it upwards so does not
drip down look just make sure it's
secure okay looking good so far we use
this to get it a little bit just make
sure that's nice is a cure
okay so far so good let's go ahead and
apply the other piece and see how this
goes but like the other piece is a
little bit easier to apply because it's
smaller so I didn't have that much more
problems with this one so go ahead apply
some more lash glue live a little bit I
have to look downwards because I need to
use this mirror but normally you would
lift your eye with your other hand like
I mentioned earlier okay much better now
I'll go ahead and just squeeze them all
together it's going to be one big lash
okay so here is the final results this
one's a little bit thicker than this one
but it's whatever I'm gonna care oh but
I think it looks pretty good especially
seeing as though I struggled like crazy
Lanois and it was grazie but what do you
guys think you guys think that this
looks good go ahead and get it close a
closer up shot she gets to see what
looks like
okay so overall just like my thoughts on
this is it's an experience okay the
experience say the least
I think that this looks pretty good I
like the fact that you cannot see a lash
band on top which is why I think people
are trying out this method because lash
bands I mean they're just not the cutest
thing you know they're just not cute so
to me my final verdict as in am I gonna
start doing this method over a district
last application method I am NOT because
I don't think that I want to have to
experience almost Pokemon out every snow
day so maybe this is something I would
do if I'm going for a really natural
look and I - I throw on some lashes and
just lashes I'm not gonna do eyeshadow
and that technique is nope
no after blending I'm not going to do it
but overall this technique is pretty
nice they look really nice so if you
want to go ahead and give a try go ahead
do at your own risk
other than that hope you guys liked me
experimenting with this if there are any
other Instagram videos you may have saw
that you're like oh my god I want us to
try this let me know and I will make
sure to do it because it's actually
pretty fun other than that I think it's
not for watching and I will see you guys
soon and let me know all your thoughts
