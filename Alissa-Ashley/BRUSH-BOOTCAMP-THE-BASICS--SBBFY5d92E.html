and welcome to bridge boot camp I wish
I've got the shirt more highs you can
actually see it's so annoying it was
kind of expensive but I still feel cool
just weren't good represent today the
video is going to be the one that I said
that I'll be beginning on August 5th and
it is brushed boot camp and basically
I'll be just going through well one if
you are a body brushes that's great I
mentioned in the last video that I had
15 staple morphe brushes and I also
mentioned that it's great for you guys
to know what brushes I'm using but it's
even more important to understand how to
use them and why I use them and where I
place them and all that stuff so this
video is going to be a deeper
introduction it's going to be similar to
the last one where I break down each
brush and what I use them for but you
guys don't get a little demo and all
that good stuff so it's gonna be a
little bit more in-depth and I just want
to make sure to do this because I didn't
go as in-depth in the last video when
breaking down each brush so if you're
wondering like okay like didn't you just
do this no this one is a little more
detailed and I just thought it was
important to include that so you guys
know then after we break down those
brushes I'm going to talk about I chose
a little bit because it's also important
to understand i shadow sand-witch
brushes work best for which i shadow
finish and then we're going to move into
a little basic demo i decide to keep
today's demo very very basic because i
do not want to start you guys off with
something too intense and i just want
you guys to be able to easily follow
along so that you guys kind of get
familiar with your brushes so if you
want to see all that I just explained
then just keep on watching and I hope
you guys enjoy okay so when talking
about brushes I feel like it's important
to know that there are different types
of brushes and they all do different
types of things and I'm not talking
about the shape of the brushes though
that's important as well I'm actually
talking about the hair on the actual
brush the two most popular style of
brushes are synthetic hair brushes and
natural hair brushes and I have a pretty
nice mixture of both of those I'll be
showing you guys today I mainly have
natch
hairbrushes containing goat hair and
sable and then I also have a couple of
synthetic hair brushes and I feel like
it's important to have a mixture of both
in your kit because yeah they do a bunch
of different things and I'm going to
show you guys in my demo later why using
a certain brush that's natural hair
won't perform the same way that a
synthetic haired brush will depending on
the product that you're using I'm
talking on my hands like like a little
crab but okay so let's go ahead and just
break this down here are the 15 brushes
that I told you guys to purchase in
order to participate in this little
bootcamp or just follow along with
whatever you have as you can see we have
a lineup of goat hair brushes sable and
synthetic so let's go ahead and just
break them down into categories and I'm
just going to explain which brush does
what and what it's best for the first
brush is the morphe m4 112 and this is
one of my favorite blending brushes I
love this brush because it has a pointed
tip so that allows me to get into my
crease a little bit more with more
control as you guys will see later on I
do have another blending brush but that
was more fanned out so I don't have as
much control so this brush is ideal for
applying shadows that I want to have a
little bit more control over so that it
does not go crazy and go all over my
crease and I end up with a raccoon I do
not want that and this is the brush that
I would use in order to blend out things
with more control the next brush is the
m22 2 and this is also a great brush
because it allows you to have more
precision when applying and depositing
eyeshadows the reason why I say deposit
is because I like to use this brush to
pick up the shadow and place it on my
eye and then go in with either the
morphe in for 1/2 or another brush I'll
be discussing later to soften it out I
just feel like it gives me a little bit
more control when it comes to building
up the intensity of my eye shadow which
is why this is a must-have the next is
the morphe 330 and as you can see it
looks quite similar to the m4 112
however the hairs are longer so you're
not going to have
as much control but at the same time
that can work in your advantage because
when applying transition shades or just
lighter softer shades it's going to
deposit nice and softly and it's not
going to be as intense the next is the
m-16 nine and as you can see it looks
basically identical to the m22 two
however the brush hairs are a tad bit
softer so it's going to pick up these
shadows a little bit more on the softer
side as you guys will see later on the
next one is the m157 and I love using
this one to deposit pigments or shadows
or any sort of shimmer onto the lid
using my either NYX mixing medium or Mac
mixing medium I'll be using the NYX one
for this segment because it's a little
bit more affordable and I want you guys
to get affordable items and it's the
bomb but I love this for cream products
and pigments there it's just perfect
like it's just nice and flat I'm sure
you guys can see it and it also has
another into it and we won't be using
this one as much this end is nice for
just kind of getting little flicks of
pigment or glitter off of your crease
area if you do get any transfer but the
NYX mixing medium the Mac mixing medium
it got a cover so we won't really need
this end of the brush but you will need
this in for sure and pretty much every
single eyeshadow look the next is the in
506 and I love this one because it's
nice and slender and skinny and it also
is a little bit more stiff than the
other blending brushes that I've showed
I know it may look a little bit similar
to those ones but it is completely
different this one picks up deep eye
shadows very very well and since it's so
skinny it gets into the crease area like
a dream and you guys will see that later
on because I did use this it's just
perfect it fits right in here with no
problems whatsoever this is definitely a
hooded eye staple the next is the m157
and I have about five of these because I
just love this brush so much it can be
used for so many different things it
could be used for a flat befouled
highlight underneath here blending out a
shadows cleaning up the crease area
kneading up the please Cleese crease
area it's just a perfect multitasker and
I like
and it's so tiny because it really
really gets in there without disturbing
any of the rest of your work the next is
the M 408 and this one is perfect for
getting into the water line and you can
also use this in the crease area as well
as you guys will see in later videos so
this is definitely a brush that also has
multi uses and that is it for the sable
hair brushes as you can see with the
sable hair brushes they tend to be
either black or deep brown and I'm not
sure if that makes a difference in
eyeshadow blending but I do know that
these ones they stay clean a little bit
longer than the gold hairs because it go
here is white so I do appreciate that
but yes those are all for the sable hair
now let's move into these synthetics now
this has got to be one of my favorite
brushes out of all the brushes I own it
is the e 27 and this brush is perfect
for blending out primers onto the eye in
my demo later on you will see that I
blend out my eye primer with another
brush a goat hair brush and it looked a
disaster and did not go on as smoothly
as when applying it with the e 27 I love
a synthetic hair brushes for blending
out any sort of cream products as you
guys will see and the smoky eye video
they are just perfect and I'll show you
guys a lot of side-by-side comparisons
as to why they work better then go hair
or saber hair brushes when applying the
creams and liquids and all that good
stuff I then have the e 19 and this is
perfect for carving this is just a nice
little brush it gets right onto the lid
it's actually almost the same size as my
lid so I could easily carve out my
crease I can carve out my little brow
bone I can apply my brow bone highlight
my flat B fold so this won't be using
every single look this one is the e36 it
is similar to the e 19 in the sense that
it's nice and tiny as well and it's
synthetic hair but I love this brush for
blending out underneath the eye this is
perfect because it's nice and soft it's
also round and it's small so it's going
to really allow you to have more
precision so you don't end up looking
like a raccoon and then I have the e 17
which is the baby version of
27 it is nice and tiny and this is what
we will use in the smoky eye video that
will probably go up next week depending
on what you guys want to see next i'ma
asks you guys down below and this you're
just perfect for blending out creams
onto the lid you get a little bit more
precision with this one then you do the
e 27 obviously because it's a little bit
more small it's not so fanned out and
that is my last synthetic haired brush
you don't need many but you have the
right ones
you'll be a-ok and now let's move into
the last little section which is the
goat hair brushes the first one is the M
514 and I love this one because it's
nice and narrow but at the same time it
has that same fluffy property that
allows you to blend out I showed a very
nicely onto your crease area and I like
the fact that it's so skinny because
it's going to get into the crease
without just creating a disaster on your
eyeball especially because our eyes are
so small you want to make sure to have a
nice thin blending brush as well as your
more fluffier one which I'm going into
in a second see next is the m-43 one
which is a nice pencil brush and this
one has multi uses as well you can
really really get into the crease area
with this brush you get under here you
can basically get everywhere with the
pencil brush it's just important to have
one like I mentioned in my introduction
to my brush bootcamp it's just important
to have one you guys will see how it
plays a big role in all of our eye
shadow looks that we do and the last one
is the m4 for one this is one of my
favorite brushes for blending out my
transition shades as well as my blank
eyeshadows which is basically an ayah
that you apply if you feel like your
eyeshadows getting a little bit too
crazy and you want to soften it up this
is perfect because it's nice and fanned
out and fluffy so if I pick up any
shadow onto this brush it's not going to
be too intense it's just going to apply
it very softly so this is definitely one
that you must have because it's very
very important and you will see that in
the videos I've been saying that
everything you will see is important but
it's important so you'll see now let's
talk about some movements and it's on
the flick of the wrist
and there's a couple different movements
and I just want to include this because
sometimes you'll think that you're going
in the right direction and it's like you
could just make one bad move or you
could be doing the improper movement
depending on the eyeshadow or the brush
that you're using and they can all go to
shambles okay so let's first talk about
the most popular motion which is the
windshield wiper motion this is the most
popular motion because that's usually
the one that people use when it comes to
depositing shadows into the crease I use
one a lot especially when applying my
softer shadows that I wanted to pause it
all over the crease area and it just
gives me a nice even blend onto the
crease area when doing that motion
you're just depositing everything nice
and evenly and that's typically for when
you want to deposit it basically
everywhere you can also sweep on the
outer corner in a corner it really just
all depends on what you're applying but
you guys will see the different ways
that you can windchill wipe in our
videos and then you have the circular
motion and this is great when applying a
shadows on the outer V of the eye
because you're just kind of controlling
it if you do the windshield wiper and
you have a deep shadow right here it's
going to travel
let's go travel away and fly away
circular is perfect when applying
shadows on the outer V so you don't go
crazy and it can also be used on the
entire eye it all depends on what you're
doing but the circular motion is great
when you want a more precise blend and
when you want to apply a shadow on a
specific area and you want to be very
very controlled next you have the
patting motion and this obviously is
great for pigments because you don't
want to sit there and take a pigment and
just move it around because then you're
going to get a bunch of fallout it's not
going to be as opaque and it's just a
bee disaster
so when applying pigments make sure to
do the patting motion think PP patting
pigment and you'll you'll you'll get it
you'll get it and then you have the
sweep or the carve and you can just go
in a straight line
whenever I'm cleaning up my lid area or
my brow I like to try to go in suite
motions so that I'm not messing up so I
kind of like to just slowly carve and
slowly sweep across my eye
so I get a nice even application and I
didn't do a little idea for this but
it's also important to understand
buffing and controlled buffing now we
will learn more about this in the smoky
eye demo coming next week again if you
guys want to see that I want to see it
so I may do next week but it's also
important to understand buffing
especially when it comes to cream
products because your buff can make or
break your eye shadow look and I'll talk
about more of that in the smoky eye demo
ok so now we understand the brushes we
understand the motion of the brushes so
let's go ahead and just talk about I
chose a little bit and then we can
finally move into our demo when
discussing eyeshadows there are two
finishes that are the most popular so
we'll be talking about those today and
we're going to talk about in the very
very briefly and they are matte and
shimmer eyeshadows that is the reason
why I told you guys to get the 35o
because it contains both of them so I'll
be able to play around both of them and
show you guys how they work so let's go
ahead and take a quick look at these
shimmer here is when my favorite
shimmers in the morphe 35o and as you
can see it's just beautiful in my
personal favorite brushes to apply any
shimmer or when working with shimmers
are either synthetic hair brushes or the
morphe m157 which i'll be using for the
duration of this class I don't think
that shimmers and natural hair brushes
like the fluffy ones work well together
whatsoever when applying your shimmers
try to use a flat brush so you can have
more control over where that shimmer is
going and for the Mac eyeshadows I love
using natural hair brushes now I can use
a synthetic hair brush for the matte
eyeshadows however it's not going to
pick up as intensely and it's just not
going to blend the same and I'll show
you guys an example of that in a later
video because I'll be discussing that
further but it's just not going to blend
the same as a natural haired brush would
and I love using my sable brushes
specifically for the matte eye shells
especially if I want to pick them up and
really get that intensity going on I
love using the same ahead brushes for
that okay so now that we've discussed
all that let's move into our demo okay
so the first thing you want to do is go
ahead and
clean up your brow this just what I like
to do I like to use the mac studio
finish concealer and as you can see the
19 brush is perfect here's an example of
using a bad brush for this this brush is
not going on as smooth it is streaky it
is it's give me a hard time so ie 19
brush is perfect or any synthetic haired
brush is perfect when applying your
cream shadows especially on the brow
because you want to look nice and neat
you don't want to like that next I'm
going to go ahead and prime as you can
see I'm dotting it on to the center part
of the eye and the reason being is that
once I blend it out I have more control
over how much goes over the entire eye
so just putting the primer on the center
and then working its way out to the
other half of the eye will give you the
perfect and the most smooth application
and as you can see on the bottom corner
I'm applying it with a natural red brush
and it looks very streaky
so again synthetic hair brushes are best
for this and I'm going to go ahead and
apply a thin layer of powder just to
kind of seal that primer in place now
I'm going to go ahead and apply my
transition shade this shade is pretty
important because it's really going to
set the tone for the rest of your
eyeshadow and it's going to ensure that
everything is nice and smooth then I'm
going to go ahead and apply my build-up
shade and this the shape I like to apply
before applying my deepest shade because
it just creates a nice gradient in the
eyeshadow and we don't get any sort of
raccoon looking eye and as you can see
I'm just packing on that color and then
I'm just going to smooth it out with my
blending brush that I use to apply my
transition shade just to make sure
everything is nice and blended
the next thing I'm going to do is deepen
it and as I mentioned earlier the in 506
is perfect for this because as you can
see it is getting really really nice and
deep into that crease and since the
brush is a little bit more compact it's
picking up the eyeshadow with more
intensity which is what I want I didn't
want that with my built up shape because
I don't know how do you want to go so I
have them working
all using this brush because I'm just
allowing it to just build up it's just
working out beautifully and then of
course you want to soften that up like
always you always want to soften in
between your shades next I'm gonna go
ahead and just carve out my crease area
and I'm gonna use my concealer for this
in my e19 brush as you can see the only
time that I allow the brush to just move
in like padding motions is nowhere near
the line where the crease is I do not
want to do that because then I risk
messing up when I get to that crease
line
I only glide it against it just so
that's nice and neat now I may go ahead
and just set this in place I'm going to
use my m157
and this is also great for just packing
any shadow on the lid it does not have
to be a shimmer it can be a matte as
well I'm also going to use this brush to
apply my shimmer and as you can see I
just coat the brush with my mixing
medium and I just apply it all over my
lid while doing this you do not want to
look up because if you do it will
transfer over to your crease and it will
just be a disaster so I'm just picking
up the shadow and I'm getting it nice
and coated onto the brush and I'm just
going to work that into where I applied
the mixing medium and as you can see
it's just going on very very nice and
opaque and that's what the mixing medium
does it just makes your shadows 10 times
more vibrant and it also ensures that it
stays in place for the entire day
transfer free hooded eye friendly and
now I'm going to go ahead and just
neaten using my nice and tiny m32 six
this step is not really always required
but I want to show you guys this just in
case you may have blinked or anything
and you have any mistakes on your crease
area just need it up with the m32 six
next I'm gonna go ahead and take some
Sephora gel liner and gels my favorite
because it just stays in place more and
it has those waterproof properties and
I'm going to take the e36 to just blend
this out in the
thirty-six is perfect for this sensitive
eye area because it's nice and soft so
it's definitely my favorite and then I'm
going to set it in place with the pencil
brush because the pencil brush is more
pointy and it gives me more control over
where that eyeshadow is going to go and
then I'm going to take my e19 again and
I'm just going to highlight my flat B
fold this is optional if you have flat B
folds and then I'm going to deepen the
outer V with the m-16 9 I like to do
this after applying the pigments so that
everything is nice and on there and I
just really have a nice visual on what I
need to deepen and as you can see I'm
using my little circular motions on the
outer V like I mentioned earlier and
then the last step is just to highlight
the inner corner and I'm going to take
some mixing medium and my e19 brush and
just make it nice and pretty and then
this is the final eye and this is what
you should have you guys know I would
normally apply some lashes but this is
just for demo purposes so you guys can
get a visual on what you want to create
so that was the first segment of brush
bootcamp I really really hope you guys
liked how everything turned out
I know that it can get boring because
it's just a budget teaching it's a bunch
of terms being thrown at you I
