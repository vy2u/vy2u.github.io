today's video is going to be on this
little affordable back to school makeup
look and it can be worn other than just
back to school I just wanted to create
something nice and simple and I give you
guys a lot of cool tips along the way so
you guys could just follow along on that
also this video is in collaboration with
Jasmine jasmine Brown here on YouTube
and we decided to just do it
back-to-school collab she did some hair
looks for you guys with her gorgeous
hair so huge I wish I had some times and
I did this simple makeup look right here
so be sure to check out her video I
linked down below if you want to have
some cute little hairstyles to wear back
to school also Before we jump into the
makeup I do want to share with you guys
an app that I've been using and before
you just scatter away because I totally
get it
some people cannot stand sponsorships
this app is pretty generous and they
will be granting someone's wish up to
$100 if you follow me on the app and the
reason why I say grant a wish is because
the app is called wisher and this app
was simply created to spread giving and
generosity in love and happiness to just
all the positive violence you can think
of because with this app you create a
profile here's mine and you just upload
everything that you can want whether it
be a camera a couch this cool desk with
awesome legs that look like aids which
is what I want it you can upload
anything from classes to anything and
you just invite your friends and family
onto the app and they're able to see
what you want and they can grant your
wish for you so they can just go ahead
and get what you want and that's your
wish granted which is why they're
granting someone who follows me their
wish of $200 and I also want to grant a
couple of you guys wishes so be sure to
follow me because I just think that's a
really really nice way to give and I
want to give to you guys I definitely
want to grant some of you guys wishes
this wasn't a part of the sponsorship or
agreement I want to do it because you
guys give so much to me
simply by watching me so be sure to
follow me
on the app and let's just get into the
makeup hope you guys like the look if
you do be sure to give a thumbs up and
let's just get into all do okay so the
first game I do is take my black
radiance true complexion shine control
primer I'm taking this because it really
actually does control shine and I doubt
that England wants to get off oily
throughout the day when at school you
want to stay nice and just flawless so
I'm going to apply this all over my face
the next thing we do is go ahead and
apply my foundation I'm taking the NYX
mineral stick foundations in the shades
9 and 10 if you can find your perfect
shade that's awesome but I like to mix
them because 9 a little bit too light
and tan is a lil bit too dark so I just
mix them both to give my ideal shape
take them are 9
you
and I'm going to buff it into my skin
using this morphe 54 I'm taking this one
because you can see it's pretty damn
mood so it's going to cover it more
areas so it's going to cut down that
blending time
see it's just covering all of my face
very very quickly bam bam
give me an even blend this for a little
more and then I can see my bam bam okay
go to the other side next for concealer
I'm taking my la girl Pro concealer it's
missing the top and it's in the shade
cool tan I'm taking coal tan because
it's not extremely overwhelmingly like
super glam highlight for my highlight
shade I used to take pure beige I'm
going to cool it down a little bit with
cool tan so I'm not looking all super
glam at school I was like go ahead and
take this come on squeeze out for me I'm
going to blend this out my Beauty
Blender
we see
I'm gonna go ahead and just set my under
eyes in place with this Iman luxury
pressed powder in the shade clay medium
with my Beauty Blender
in there for the rest of my face I'm
going to take this Maybelline shine-free
powder I cannot put oh there it is
listed right here the whole time I was
looking for it but I found the cap so
that's yeah my makeups and shambles but
this is my Maybelline shine free powder
in the shade medium and this is a morphe
eat three brush I'm going to lightly set
the rest of my face next using that same
brush I'm trying to use minimal brushes
I'm gonna take my black radiance pressed
powder in this in shade bronze glow very
soft very subtle and then go ahead and
warm up complexion needs a three mythic
that's easiest and then for my nose
because realistically speaking sometimes
nose contouring can make us fill up more
confident because it's more divine I'm
just gonna take that powder yeah dick to
the powder very lightly dust off the
excess that I'll go to crazy I'm so
sweep it across my nose I've showed you
guys this before it's a really nice easy
lazy way nose contour just adds a little
bit definition so we could feel a little
bit better found it's not too blank for
brows first time I go ahead and just
outline them because that's a little
trick I to use if I want to cut down my
brow time I'm going to take my morphe 43
and just some concealer my favorite cuts
it with my brows and I'm gonna go ahead
and clean them up first outline
and then after outlining I'm gonna take
my Knicks tame and frame brow pomade
this is a shade chocolate I'm just go
ahead and just fill in my brows and
that's the East Bay about outlining the
first is that you just fill them in it's
very very very easy and I'm so go ahead
and take a morphe e27 and just blend
that concealer I'm gonna go ahead and
take that la girl Pro concealer and just
place that all over my lids go ahead and
blend that out I'm gonna set that in
place with my Maybelline shine free
powder I'm going to take that same black
radiance bronze little powder and that
same morphe 27 and just flush that all
over my crease area
I'm not going to take this wet and wild
palette and this is in the shade or the
the name is coming in latte as a studio
eyeshadow palette I'm taking this shade
right here and this shade right here and
I'm going to take this on a more feet
five in by thirteen brush and just place
this in the crease area
I'm taking this more feet are forty one
brush in those same shades and just
place it on the outer corner I'm taking
this NYX jumbo eye pencil in this in the
shade cashmere I don't want to take milk
because milk is just plain white and I
feel like that just may look a little
bit crazy but cashmere is a nice kind of
Goldy shade it's still going to brain
but not just look crazy right it's that
it's gonna be nice and simple also go
ahead and just place this on my lid as
well
I'm taking this light coming champagne a
pink shade in the palette the place that
right on top and of course we have to
have our winged liner I just like
everyone loves sweet liner and I love it
too now so I'm going to take this Milani
escape put macked 17-hour where winged
liner liquid liner
dude it's create a winged liner
and therefore laughs I'm taking my
L'Oreal telescopic carbon black mascara
for blush I'm going to take this in my
see love addicts by Oh Timmy it's a
photo move annex lip and cheek tint and
this is in the shade
cheeky strawberry place it on my cheek
looks like blood I'm go ahead and use my
fingers just to kind of DAB it in and on
top of that I'm gonna take this BH
Cosmetics wild and alluring baked
eyeshadow on highlighter palette I'm
taking this really nice illuminating
it's brand new okay I'm taking this o
illuminating blush be nice and pinky
until I can just dab it on top and
there's some more fiji 35 brush and then
for my highlight I'm going to take the
highlight shade in the palette and this
is a morphe r-12 fan brush
if your lips I'm going to take my lip
and cheek tint the keiki strawberry I'm
gonna take these Milani amore matte
liquid lipsticks and I'm use this combo
before because it's definitely one of my
favorites I'm going to take these shades
to covet and adorable so work them take
covet now slather adorable on top
okay so now I'm gonna try to do cool
freckles uh if it looks stupid you guys
have crimes you don't laugh at me okey
I'm gonna do I'm gonna take this angle
spot is actually a paint brush let's
really nice and thin I'm going to take
this black radiance pressed powder first
cuz I just I'm scared so I just need to
get a powder to outline I'm going to try
to create some dimensions I'm taking
this more feet tain gel eyeliner it's
brown and I'm going to go ahead and just
start adding more than that
Fatma does a very light layer and my
mainly powder and hop okay so I just
went to my sister's room and I was like
how do they look so according to her
looks pretty good though
Hey guess I'll run with it the last step
would be to just set my face in place
with my NYX dewy skin finish or do we
finish it's a second spray its dewy so
