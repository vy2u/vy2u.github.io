this video I have another Halloween
makeup tutorial for you yes I am hitting
you back to back let the Halloween
stories first to start with Pennywise
and now as you can see it has shifted to
a whole nother direction and this video
is going to be on this Bratz doll
inspired makeup look and as you can tell
like whenever I say it like because I've
tried to film this intro a couple times
the noise is distracting me I get so
happy and excited because I have always
loved Bratz dolls growing up I love them
so much because I mean if you look at
that stuff I mean it kind of looks like
me you guys big lips it made me feel
happy about my lips kind of growing up
because I saw a doll and I had that kind
of representation to look at like okay
you know like I love my Bratz dolls
they're popular they have these really
nice the left to his lips
I do too so make a little bit better
about it so I don't know like I'm just
always loved Bratz dog I love just a
whole vibe it's I mean Barbie can never
okay no fans let me but I've always
loved Bratz dolls so I'm so excited to
bring to you guys this tutorial and
here's my inspiration afford this Bratz
doll makeup look and yeah I just I want
to get into it right now I want to get
started I will say the process of
becoming the dogless it was ugly and I
almost stopped because like what the
hell but we have this so there is a
light in the tunnel so if you guys want
to see this look and just keep on
watching also do not forget to subscribe
I never tell you guys to because I want
you guys to do it with ease subscribe to
my channel why not let's go ahead and
get started and I hope you guys enjoy
the video and see me turn - okay look
this Tarte hey guys it's normal meat I
went ahead and put a little hair tie on
okay a t-shirt because I do not want to
get a lot of makeup in my hair and I'm
going to start out with the makeup bye
down my brows as you can see there's a
piece of brow missing on the tail and
that's because I accidentally freaking
shaved off all while doing all these
Halloween tutorials so yeah me the brow
that I took forever to go back it it's
gone all right P anyways I went ahead
and added some primer because we're
gonna be putting on a lot of makeup
today and now I'm taking this Make Up
For Ever Ultra HD foundation stick and I
am just pushing that product into my
brow because I found that this method
kind of made the brow more invisible
than other things I tried off-camera
like a liquid foundation a cream worked
best over the brow so I am just packing
that on I mixed two colors and the
reason why you saw me frown earlier is
because I think I realized that I got
the wrong shade and look at me being
dumb and still putting on my face it is
way too light and as you can see I'm
like what the hell so I had to take my
fancy foundation to kind of save the day
and make me not look like a freaking
ghost I'm not a ghost
I'm Bratz okay so I have to get that in
there and then now I'm taking this
banana powder and I'm just going to set
the living crap out of my face I want to
look very matte and very flat and yeah
well to the doll nice and flat and as
you guys can tell I did not do any
highlighting will conceal or anything my
face is literally flat and I feel like
it looks so ugly but it is what a doll
looks like when I looked at the doll she
didn't have any highlight so I tried to
get this as accurate as I could so we
just gotta go with the flow even if we
look at a flat alien because that's what
I feel like I look like okay so after
this we're gonna move on to the brows
and this is everyone's favorite part
you're not being sarcastic because yeah
literally like people were like oh my
god those brows look weird I'm a doll
fool like of course you're looking a
little strange but as you guys can see I
am marking out where I'm going to draw
the brows and if you look at a Bratz
their brows are really spaced apart so I
had to do that as well so I just kind of
followed a natural angle but not natural
it's so hard to explain but you guys saw
what I did I kind of just made my
markings and now I am just drawing a
really
Brown line because that's what their
brows look like and I'm not going to go
to detail because I will go over them
later on but I just want to get a little
lay out so I can focus on the eyeshadow
and for the eyeshadow I'll give you guys
a tip because I started out with doing
the liner first and I should have did
this shadow first because I ended up
having to go over my lines anyway so
that's just a tip for you you can use
the liner as a guideline because it was
helpful in that matter but I got shadow
on top of it so I had to go over the
liner so if you want to avoid doing that
you should do the shadow part first and
you will see what I mean when I start
the shadow part
after I do the wing I start to draw the
little the fake crease that she has it's
basically like the creases we have but
just more defined because it's tall like
and this is when I realized that I
should have did that after the fact
because I took the milk makeup pencil
and it went all over it and I took this
pencil to lay down my pink shadow so
yeah as you can see it literally got on
the wing it got on the line so if you do
recreate this definitely just do the
shadow part first
and then the other stuff afterwards I
didn't know this because of my first my
first go but definitely do the shadow
first
now for the purple shadow i used a kind
of shimmery shadow because if you look
at the eyes on the doll
they're not super matte but they're not
super glittery either so a shimmer brand
the middle will suffice and I am just
packing on this shadow with a really
small pencil brush just to get it nice
and controlled and to make sure I don't
over blend my over blend
I mean blend good because you don't
really want to blend goo with this you
want to be kind of sharp and then I wet
my brush a little bit and I took a
little liner brush and I just kind of
carved out the shadow ever so lightly
not too intense because that is what the
doll's eyes look like and I want it to
be as accurate as possible so I'm just
carving it out really really lightly and
yeah I'm just trying to stay control
it's so hard for me to not blend good I
was like the list so where's this going
at literally wants to wash it off but I
was like Alyssa you're a dog your brats
your Bratz doll anyways next I'm taking
a light shimmer purple shade and I am
packing this on underneath the brow you
want to take your time you do not want
to do too much sweeping over it you just
want to pat pat pat pat pat because you
have to remember there's glue under
there so you do not want to interrupt it
you want to take your time with this
part trust me
otherwise you may have a mess on your
hands and I do not want us to be a mess
I want us to be a brat okay
so just take your time with this part
after this I went back into the brows
like I mentioned earlier I was going to
add a little bit on to them I just want
to make sure that I got the eyeshadow
down so I'm just kinda longing them I do
not want to be too long because we got
to look spaced apart but just making
them a little bit better
next I'm taking this NYX jumbo pencil in
milk and I am writing out the waterline
like a doll like a dual because this is
what it looks like so do not skip this
step otherwise it won't look as
doll-like and then after that I'm taking
a black liquid liner and I am going to
create that little line underneath the
doll's eyes as well as my little fake
lashes underneath I could have did
bottom lower lashes but
I just felt like I got a super doll
effect by doing the little three little
you know the little doll lashes a little
three little lashes that's what they got
so that is what I did and then for the
top lashes I got these really really
cheap lashes from the beauty supply
store and you want these to not be
fluffy or wispy you know none of that
good stuff that's soldier stuff you want
it to be plasticky and just like this
just very very straightforward and then
next I'm gonna go ahead and just contour
the crap out of my jaw line and I'm
going to add some bronzer the same
bronzer that I used on my chin to my
cheeks and I'm kind of rounding it out
because a Bratz dolls face it seems to
kind of have a roundness about it so I
wanted to convey that you know and then
I'm also going to apply this bronzer to
my nose but I'm only going to apply it
to the tip of my nose because if you
look at the Bratz nose it's so tiny and
so cute so I didn't want to eat long
gave my nose by adding you know the
contour to the sides too much I mainly
want to focus all that bronzy goodness
on the tip of my nose for my lips
okay you guys probably be like what the
heck Alyssa what happened to your Clips
as you can see there's stuff on my lips
and there's evidence of what I tried to
do which was underline my lips to create
a Brad shape and then I realized Alyssa
you have these big voluptuous Bratz lips
so why the heck are you underlining them
so I end up going over everything with
his pink lipstick anyway and the only
parts of my lips that were kept
underlined or the outer parts right on
the corners because I wanted my bottom
lip to have an extreme pout so I felt
like rounding it out like I'm doing now
it gave me that pout but yeah lining my
lips with the pink liner it was kind of
a waste of time because I end up doing
it all over again
so to resume I've applied that pink
lipstick I'll list every color down
below and then now I'm going over it
with this coloured raine lipstick
because it's a purple kind of shimmery
unicorn type color and it was just it
was so Bratz so so perfect and now I'm
taking this Kat Von D lipstick that I
held up in the beginning when I started
my lips and I am going to use this to
outline the lips like I did originally
it went over
I know it's complicated but I hope that
made sense and now to finish off you
look I'm gonna go ahead and add my
little mole because I mean you just have
to have the mole duh and then I might go
ahead and just powder puff my face a
little bit because I was getting a
little bit shiny so if you do happen to
go out with this look maybe bring a
puffs you can stay nice and flat next
I'm gonna go ahead and add on my jacket
I'll have every store that I got my
accessories from listed down below gonna
pop on my earrings and yeah I was just
so excited to get everything and put it
all together we are going to pop on my
wig and unfortunately I do not have a
pony tail wig nor do I know how to make
a pony tail out of a wig I'm not my
sister I'm not that hair savvy so I just
loved it as is and kind of clipped it
back I added some sunnies because that's
what she had on and her look I'm gonna
go ahead and add some blush you cannot
forget your blush because I mean dolls
just have that really nice blush look
which is why I decided to use a cream
blush because it's gonna be subtle but
still there and when looking at the
reference photo that's kind of what the
vibe I got some a go ahead and pack that
on and then lastly I'm going to add a
little shine to the lips I did not want
to use a gloss because it's not going to
realistically last about the day but a
little shiny kind of duochrome shadow
will suffice and then that is it for
this Bratz look I hope you guys liked
how it turned out on Twitter you guys
like it through hope YouTube liked as
well if you guys happen to recreate it
please go ahead and tag me so I can
retweet and see it but other than that
thank you guys so much for watching and
I will see you guys in my next upload
