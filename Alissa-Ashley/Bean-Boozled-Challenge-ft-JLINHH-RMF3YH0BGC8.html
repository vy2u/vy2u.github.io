blue or toothpaste listen did you get to
pay their dues face and it looked
tolerable it's just like two faces if
you don't I mean if you're cool with
brushing your teeth in it's cool okay
lime or lawn clippings
I got a lung clippings lots of things I

that one
okay tutti frutti or stinky socks at
today I got stinky socks and matific
fruitcake um okay stinky sauce was the
worst flavor for me out of all the
flavors it tastes like so many like old
ass sweat I don't know how to explain
it's hella nasty licorice or skunk spray
we got a cream just resting and it was
horrible
obviously not as bad as stinky socks but
the skunk spray leaves the taste in your
mouth
horrible coconut or baby wipes I got
baby wipes and it tastes just like baby
wipes it's tolerable but still super
nasty juicy pear or booger booger is
disgusting
we got booger and that was disgusting
and I was expecting to dissapear cuz my
favorite ones I'm sad caramel corn or
moldy cheese
we got moldy cheese disgusting yellow
cheese it was horrible and at least at
least a horrible smell like when you
spit it out on your plate and smell it
you can smell it
so is sodas barf which is next peach or
Mars we both got barf and it was
disgusting
it's as if you threw up all the white
ones yeah besides if you throw up on
your plate and just ate your barf it's
horrible okay chocolate pudding or
canned dog food we both got chocolate
pudding to think on good thing and then
