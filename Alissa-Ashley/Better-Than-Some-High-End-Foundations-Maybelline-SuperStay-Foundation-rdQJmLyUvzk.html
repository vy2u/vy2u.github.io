for today's video it's really random but
I was out riding last night because I
need to get some trash bags and then
naturally I was a makeup so I went to
the makeup section and I was just
checking out the stuff you know and I
came across the new maybelline superstay
full coverage foundation I came across
these and I was like what's that so I
grabbed two shades I grabbed the shades
3:55 coconut and a330 for warm Sun and I
want to try it out for you guys on
camera I had it on earlier because I
filmed another video and I was like oh
my gosh so I have to do a wear test with
it because it just looked stunning I
could tell you that right now so if you
guys want to see a demo and see how it
lasts about the day then just keep on
watching and hope you guys enjoy it
okay so for the shades and here's one
thing I will say I don't know if there's
more shades in between I could
definitely look it up and confirm for
you guys on the screen if there is but
at the drugstore
it went from 334 to 355 and to me that's
a huge jump and I feel like if I do have
a shake it's gonna be right in the
middle because 334 it's just like a
little bit too light for my preference
but 355 is too dark so that's always the
case for my life I'm gonna go ahead and
pump out about 2 pumps of 334 this one
looks like and it looks like you'll
match but I mean I just like it's too
light and maybe it's cuz I like to look
a little more tan but you guys can see
that I mean you guys will see what I
mean I am breaking out as you can see
it's okay
and I'm gonna go ahead and take a morphe
34 there's two one is in
see I mean it's just a little too light
it's too light for me
see how well it covered my little
blemish yes all that right literally
just disappeared so the coverage on this
is bomb okay so here's what we're
looking like and as you can see yeah it
is too light for me so that is where
3:55 comes in the mix pump out one hump
of 355 and I'm gonna apply this to the
perimeter of my face imma go ahead and
blend it up see how it matches so much
better so much better and I'm actually
355 coconut in the powder to fit me
powder it's always like when you wanted
not that in the foundation it's just a
little bit too dark it'll buy you my
summer color but right now it is too
dark but it matches perfectly when I
blended in with other foundation so it's
okay I think honestly like with how nice
this finishes I don't even care that
have to mix two because man when I put
it on earlier I was like oh my goodness
I have to show them this okay so here's
what we're looking like and as you can
see it just it looks so good it looks so
good it's like it's matte but not super
matte it's almost kind of like I don't
know what kind of vibe it's giving me
but it looks really like nice skin like
I yeah this may be a winner
I am hoping it's a winner because yeah
it impressed me the second I put it on
because like I mentioned in my Tarte
video with the shaped a foundations they
were okay but they didn't like wow like
oh my gosh need this in my life this I'm
like hmm especially for the price point
I'm like we may yeah this may be bomb so
I'm gonna go ahead and do the rest of my
face over on my concealer and my setting
powders and we're gonna get today
started I guess gonna show you guys I'm
gonna
I'm going to take my colour-pop no
filter concealer
and then I'm like always I wouldn't take
my makeup revolution banana power to set
it in place and I'm gonna go ahead and
take my morphe 58 just to blend it away
I'm actually not gonna take my Sephora
mikerickson powder today because I kind
of want to keep this very affordable and
not high and even though the Micra truth
isn't high in but it's $22 and I feel
like it's a little high so I want to
keep this really nice and drugstore so
I'm just gonna take some banana powder
just to lightly sit this part of my face
even though as you guys can see the
foundation to riot down so I didn't
really need to set it but I'm still
gonna add a little bit hotter I'm gonna
contour a little bit with this elf
finishing powder and this is dark deep
Anette from kiko milano
i'm going to take this arctic holiday
baked blush this is dreaming coral I'm
gonna go ahead and spritz my face with a
morphe setting mist okay so now my base
is done so I'm gonna go ahead and finish
the rest of my face off-camera and be
right back it is currently 1:45 so I'm
gonna try to keep this on my face for
the next eight to ten hours eight to ten
hours should be a long enough time to
see the wear on this bad boy what I mean
I look so radiant I look so like my
color looks great
let me go ahead and just do my brows and
all that good stuff and be right back
alright so here is my face for the day I
just decided to come upon some quick
shadow I'm gonna go ahead and wear this
foundation for the rest of the day and
the night and then I'll be right back
with you guys to show you guys how I
held up I am so tired I feel like I've
been like filming and filming and
uploading and I'm very tired but here's
what we're looking like it is currently
10:30 so I think we've had enough time
to try out this foundation so let's do a
breakdown who actually breakdown number
one this shadow from butter LONDON the
glaze and I gloss I kind of hate it
because while it looked really pretty
when I put it on earlier it's so patchy
and I got some glitter all under my eye
can you guys see that all over here so I
don't like it but in terms of the
foundation let's go ahead and get closer
again so as you can see we have some oil
around our nose
fit and we have a little bit of creasing
but honestly I've had worse
so I mean in terms of like the little
creasing I don't think it's that bad and
in terms of the oil around my nose I've
seen it be worse like I've seen it like
all over saw me honestly I mean for how
long I've had it on I think that was
like what like nine or so hours or I'm
so tired I'll figure out when I added
the video I don't think it looks that
bad cuz I mean with this it's nothing to
just powder it really quickly with your
little to go powder
I mentioned the Finn T beauty of is a
matte blotting powder is really good
just nothing to touch up the nose but I
don't know I don't think it looks too
terrible if anything I think I look kind
of radiant which I like because
sometimes when I wear certain
foundations I do tend to get a little
bit dry towards the end of the day I'm
not too mad at it and maybe it's because
like I'm very realistic I'm not sure you
guys can tell I tried my best to give
every product the benefit of the doubt
sometimes I don't because you know I'm
like okay this is terrible I know it but
what foundations you have to be
realistic
naturally your skins that produce oils
it's just natural especially if you get
oil oily around certain areas that's
just bound to happen but I can
definitely say that I've seen myself
look more oily with other foundations
and I've definitely seen myself just
look nasty and to me I don't look as bad
as I've seen myself look when I've
warned other foundations and that's what
I compare it to and especially given the
price point of this on nation I'm not
that mad at it I think that I kind of
like it a lot let's go ahead and get
closer again see how like my skin it's
like radiant yeah this is oily right
here but I'm happy because it didn't
come off of my nose so that's a good
thing oh well let me know you guys's
thoughts in the comment section down
below so far like even on Twitter
everyone loves this foundation and I
think that everyone's onto something
I think it's a really nice one compared
to like others that I've tried so I'm
not too mad about it so that's it's for
this little review and wear test I hope
you guys liked it cuz I mean I'm so
freakin tired I want to go to bed but
thank you guys so much for watching if
you guys liked it be sure to give it a
thumbs up and I will see you guys in my
next video peace out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
