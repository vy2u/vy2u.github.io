today's tutorial I'll be showing you how
to achieve this very black smokey eye
honestly this has got to my favorite
smokey eye ever because I really just
kind of stepped on my comfort zone and
just went for it and it's so dark and
hmm I love this so I hope you guys enjoy
it as well and I didn't do my foundation
concealer and powder and stuff on camera
because I want to you know have more
time for the smokey eye and you guys see
me deliver teen all the time I do have a
finish up my contour and highlight all
that stuff my lip but the main focus is
the eyes so I hope you guys enjoyed the
tutorial and yeah let's just get right
into it I don't want to talk too much
cuz I already talked enough so let's go
okay so the first thing I do is just
take my mac studio finish concealer
because I use as my primer and I place
that all over my lid just gonna really
make sure that's nice and on there go
sexy the other eye is a camera thumbs up
blend that out my finger just make sure
it's nice and smooth and even and then
we have step it in place with some loose
translucent powder
this one as a laura mercier okay so we
can't just jump into the sexy smoky we
have to gradually build it I'm going to
take the melt cosmetics blur I think
this is the dark matter stack on my
morphe m51 9 brush and begin and placing
that in my crease area and I'm actually
going to switch over to my zoeva 2 to a
love crease because a little more fluffy
and I actually want that color more all
over the lid and it's very important to
kind of build your color when you're
doing such a smoky eye you never want to
start your darkest color first because
then you don't look crazy you look crazy
and now I'm gonna take what is this
unseen also my melt cosmetics and I'm
just gonna place that right on top of
that I'm being very cautious when it
comes to you know my building you know I
want to just make sure that it's gradual
as hell place that all over and just
really bring it in there okay
so that is our transition shade and
that's just a shade that's gonna make us
avoid raccoon eyes and create some
sexiness not some raccoon enos you don't
want that now I'm gonna take that first
brush that I originally took the morphe
m51 9 and honest osseous fudge eyeshadow
and just place that right on top of that
as you can see I started out with a very
light brown then a darker brown and now
even darker Brown I really really want
to build this up you know just to be on
the safer side now we're going to start
with the smokiness I'm going to take the
juvies place J 1 to 7 precision brush
and my motives cosmetics little black
dress liner I'm just taking the liner
pot and just really getting that brush
in there I want to make sure I get a
nice coat because I want you just one
coat blend it and feed that I don't want
to build it because then that's how it
gets all dry and bad
and I'm just gonna place that right on
top hope I didn't get enough I didn't it
guy okay there we go now it's warm okay
this is gonna be intense all right there
we go then we go I'm gonna bring it very
you know lightly on to the crease area
as you see it's on the lid but it's a
little bit on the crease as well and I'm
gonna take my Sigma buff and blend brush
and just really start working on
blending that out so I'm going so fast
with this you guys as you can see it's
like you know it's hard I'm here you
know you got a really blend before it
really sets in place otherwise it's
gonna look very unblended now I'm going
to take dark matter which is a really
nice black from the dark matter stack
from melt cosmetics and go over that
black just like that you kind of want to
set it in place so it doesn't get
everywhere
now obviously you don't want to leave
your are like this unless that's the
look you're going for for Halloween but
sometimes so I'm gonna take unseen and
just really smooth that out you know you
really want to soften it out and take
your time with this because you want it
to be you know nice and smooth and not
all patchy and bad looking
if you feel like you're losing any kind
of black you know intensity as you can
see it kind of went away take more black
eyeshadow and place it on top but you
just want to make sure you get that and
seen in there so it doesn't look all
crazy this again and I'm I'm literally
like I'm placing it over here because
since I have putted eyes if I were to
just place over here it won't be as
intense you know I'm saying so I have to
really place it all over my eye you know
really get over that hood otherwise it's
not gonna be good that rhyme I'm a
rapper now and if you feel like you
brought in a little bit too over there
just take a blank brush and solve it up
a bit as you can see it's fine now just
keep working on building Tom's satisfied
with the blend of this eyeshadow now for
the under eye I'm going to take my
little black dress liner in myzel Ava 2
to 6 mud your brush and get that liner
nice on the brush make sure it's nice
and creamy I'm going to place it
directly in my waterline and a little
underneath it
I'm going to take my zoeva pencil brush
it's a 230 Lux pencil and just smudge it
out take some unseen just to soften it
look the ball yes four lashes I'm going
to take Lily lash in style Miami and you
guys these lashes are so gorgeous
I actually got sent all of the Lily
lashes from the mink and luxury
collection and I have been living for
them so they will likely be the only
lash you see me using my tutorials
because they're just so pretty and I'm
so pop that right on top okay so the
final step would be to you know I wasn't
just to leave it like this you guys
wasn't gonna just leave it all black and
looking someone I'm blend it so I'm
going to take makeup thief Coco bear
which is a nice warm kind of reddish
brown shade I'm just place that right on
top of that black right there on that
edge I'm not going to take away any
black bats you know already nice and
intense I'm just going to put it right
on that edge so that doesn't look all
crazy on blended and whatnot and it's
gonna warp the ayat' bit too
I took a zoeva 231 crease brush to do
that now I'm going to go in with my
zoeva 2 to 8 and just socked in it
softened soften it and the last of all
step is going to be to apply some bottom
lash mascara
you say we had it on that's it with DRA
me crazy cuz outside I know I'm living
for this most young to finish off the
rest of the face come with incomplete I
may take my to face dark chocolate so
leg bronze up and my morphe III brush
I'm just really get into those
cheekbones I'm kind of like I look so
fierce that kind of like wanna go out
just to scare people I don't really have
like a destination ever so like oh no I
was still going under take more of that
bronzer lets you face in a more feet in
five seventeen brush to kind of do a
little bit of nose contouring very light
I don't want to be too intent to go I
want the folks be the eyes next two
minutes hate max he just blush in that
same morphe brush just add some blush
okay so first I'm gonna take benefits
Sun be hosted Jaime take Sunbeam as a
placement on the high point of my cheek
all right I'm going to try blend it out
I'm gonna blend it out the beauty
blender - and I've only used this as a
base you know so I kind of want to be
not wet but you know a little bit you
call it not dry I went to the laura
mercier face illuminator just place that
right on top okay for lip color I feel
like a super muted type of new colors
look really gorgeous I'm going to take
my kiss New York rose to call me little
super circles in speak my mind cuz it's
