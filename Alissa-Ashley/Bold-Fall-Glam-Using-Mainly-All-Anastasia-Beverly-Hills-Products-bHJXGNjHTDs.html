today's video is going to be on this
look that you see right here using
mainly on Nastasia Beverly Hills
products I cannot say it was all honest
hacia but like about 95 percent was
honest hacia product because I just yeah
I want to show on senses love also I
know that Fridays are normally brush
bootcamp days but after last week I
couldn't I couldn't tell what you guys
want it so to make it easier I'm just
gonna go ahead and put a poll up for
this videos be sure to let me know with
the poll do you want I rush bootcamp or
face brush bootcamp to begin let me know
so I can know for next week and yes that
is it this look was kind of a struggle
to film I almost stopped Midway because
my eyeshadows okay what's going on hmm
who's going on I just kept going so yeah
you want to see I created this look then
just keep on watching be sure to give me
some love or some critiques if you have
and I'm going to care just do you just
enjoy it hope you enjoyed it and let's
just get into the look okay so with the
new anastacio stick foundation I've
heard from the most part that it was
made for oily skin however I have dry
skin and I felt absolutely flawless
wearing it what just for some extra
hydration measures I'm going to take the
Laura Mercier hydrating foundation
primer because I've been using this
lately it is the bomb so go ahead play
this first
also I've also heard that it is better
to apply it and blend it out the brush
in the beauty blender but for the sake
of doing a demo I'm going to do one side
of my beauty blender other side of the
brush so you guys can be the judge of
that so for my shade in a summertime I'm
more tan I would definitely be just cool
golden however I find that mixing amber
right now my skin tone is right now is
ideal because amber is a little more
light it's similar to how my NYX
foundation has to be exchanged 9:00 to
10:00 at to make sense on baby news
basically let me go ahead and apply
amber and I know that Amber looks like
it would be my perfect shade but as I
blend it out it will look a little bit
too light it's really tricky my skin's
very too tricky so I like to apply a
little bit of cool roll in as well so
cool golden is more yellow tone which is
what I am and I feel like amber has a
little bit more painted tones so mix
them together get my deal shade so apply
a lot I'm just I'm a full tub fiends
okay so let's go ahead and blend out
this side of the Beauty Blender okay so
it's blending but it's just not blending
as fast
definitely not as fast unless you kind
of move it around a little bit so it's
definitely tricky blending with a Beauty
Blender but it just takes a little more
time it's doable but just take some time
we get together she says let's make this
open okay so here is this side blend it
out with a Beauty Blender and I use a
new Beauty Blender because I want to see
how much product was picked up on the
sponge just to see if it was absorbing
more than it was actually applying it
and I mean for the most part it doesn't
look like it did too much absorbing it
take too much of the product away agent
blended it was a little bit difficult to
blend yes just a little bit let's go
ahead and just split up this side with
the brush to see the difference to blend
out this side of my face I'm gonna take
this morphe e6 let's go ahead and see
how it blends okay yeah so it definitely
blends faster just Rock the bat I can
tell if they look faster so as you can
see that was definitely much quicker
than using a Beauty Blender go ahead and
use this for this side as well just make
sure things nice and even it was
definitely much quicker in the Beauty
Blender both sides look even it didn't
seem like either one of them kind of
determined the coverage of the
foundation it both looks pretty nice the
foundation itself
it feels very skin-like in my opinion
and it just looks so flawless and just
it just so it's so flawless like when I
was using snapchat anyone needs a field
so it's not flawless it looked so now
let's go ahead and apply a concealer and
move along a little bit and finish the
whole face from this video we're gonna
keep it as honest hacia as possible so
I'm going to take this concealer in the
shade 2.5 I used to love this concealer
it was like my Holy Grail and I ran out
to buy some more
and then for my contour I'm going to
take this foundation stick and this one
is in the shade walnut now I'll go ahead
and blend this out with the more pe6
and to set my under eye as well as my
highlighted areas I'm going to take my
lower Mercedes powder
in different of rest of my face I'm
taking this Sephora micro smooth powder
and it's in the shade 40 and this is
some more if you eat too okay so I'm
gonna hand brought you guys in closer
because it was requested that whenever I
do eyeshadow I come in closer so I'm
going to do that for you guys for my
brows I obviously have to use my honest
hace a chocolate dip brow so I go ahead
and take the anasazi number 12 brush and
fill in my brows
and then when I get to this little part
right here I'm going to take the brow
Wiz in the shade chocolate and go ahead
and fill it in
you
now they go ahead and take my Auto sauce
a clear brow gel just to set it in place
to prime my i'm going to take my morphe
r35 and this is the Anasazi and
waterproof cream color and the shade
honey and it's absolutely amazing i got
it recently because it just kind of
looked like an eye primer even though
it's a cream color and i don't really
know what else i'll people used it for
but it's really good as an eye base so i
go ahead and use this as a primer it
almost reminds me of Mac soft ochre but
a little bit more creamy for eyeshadow
I'm going to take the Anasazi single
eyeshadow in red earth and I'm taking my
morphe in for 112 just to blend this out
into my crease oh let me go ahead and
just apply a little bit of powder on use
my eye to catch any fallout
in that net dip into the modern a
Renaissance palette I'm taking blue one
fresco and I place this right on top
next I'm going to take love letter which
is our main shade and places right on
top
and I'm going to take my morphe in 3:30
just soften that out because get a
little bit of control and then resume to
applying love-letter
I'm then going to go ahead and take my
Mac mixing medium liner and I'm going to
place these shade antique bronze on my
lid and that's from the modern
renaissance palette as well
and then I go in with my Kat Von D
tattoo liner and shade trooper and just
create a wink let me go ahead and just
place a little bit of brown liner in my
waterline now I'm taking this morphe
import way just to blend it out on top
of that I'm taking Anastacio noir single
eyeshadow just to really intensify it
and then underneath that I'm going to
take a love letter just to come add some
piggy tints underneath
an different lashes I'm taking Lu lashes
in style by a me
now for my contour I'm super annoyed
because I cannot find my contour kit
anywhere so I'm just like go ahead and
just use the powder that I've been using
lately because I cannot find it and it's
really depressing and I thought about
just stopping everything going to the
ball but that's just doing a lot of work
so it's okay so I'm go ahead and take
this morphe e3 just up on my contour
switching over to my m5 - for for my
nose and number blush I'm taking NARS
seduction just to keep up with this like
plumbing theme and it's some morphe 3
for my highlight I'm taking my morphe 33
and the honest offset illuminator and so
Hollywood use this
and if I flip card I'm going to take
trust issues
now I'm going to mix in sepia so here's
the finished look I hope you guys like
it because for whatever reason yeah I
don't know why it's in such a struggle
fill my eyeshadow was just like mess
with me it's like I almost stopped
almost stopped Midway I was like forget
this look but it's Bom
