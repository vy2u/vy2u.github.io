want to make sure everything's nice and
soft I'm going to take my Azul Ava two
three four left smokey shader brush just
to pack that color onto my lid I'm gonna
go ahead and take my L'Oreal True Match
concealer and just clean up my under eye

out eye shadow I'm just really feeling
that look lately so enjoy my Beauty
Blender I'm go ahead and set that in
place with my kett cosmetics colorless
powder and I mix it with my Laura
Mercier I'm gonna go ahead and just set
the rest of my face with that powder as

catch any fallout and I'm going to take
concrete jungle again and just place
that against my glasses that lashline
waterline area I'm go ahead and apply a
thin coat of mascara this is benefits
