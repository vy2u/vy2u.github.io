today's video is going to be a how-to
bold smoked winged liner look with
chocolate cherry lips it is a very sexy
look in my opinion and this winged liner
is pretty suitable for hooded eyes as
you can see it really looks nice and
flattering and the wing is still fleeky
so if you want to see how I achieve this
look then just keep on watching it will
be a talk through video so you guys can
really get a lot of information please
subscribe and let's jump right into it
okay so the first thing I'm going to do
you can see a little marking there cuz I
almost started without prying my hide
I'm gonna take Mac soft ochre because I
can't find my shiny primer and there's
the only thing that's close to me and
I'm just going to pry my eye let me try
to take a finger that's not so horrible
since it is close up and my nails are
jacked right now and then I'm going to
take some more Mercier translucent
powder and just set that primer in place
now I'm going to take the zoeva
cosmetics 317 wing liner brush this is
my favorite liner brush use my brows as
well I'm gonna take my naked smoky
palette I'm going to take the shape
password and I'm taking this because
it's a light kind of grayish color and I
want to use it as a guideline before I
go immediately into the Inglot number 77
gel liner because yeah once you put it
on it stays on so I'm just gonna follow
right on the outer part of my eye
if you watch my basic how-to winged
liner my apprehended eyes you know that
I like to shut in the eye I look
straight forward I make my little
marking on where I wings gonna go and
I'm going to just begin connecting it
just like that as you can see I'm not
going too far up but you'll see why as I
do this and you'll see why that oh come
on folks on me where you doing you will
see why I have a little gray flick right
there so I'm gonna keep that little
marking right there I'm just work on
creating my wing using the eye shadow
first before I go in with this gel liner
make sure they match
alright I'm confident that that is
identical match this eyes and now I'm
going to work on building the wing with
the Inglot number 77 gel liner I am very
very nervous but I am hopeful so let's
hope this goes well you grab my mirror
i'ma start working on the liner
I'm going to line it first before
filling it in just to be sure
all right so we're getting we're getting
we're getting there
go ahead and look straight forward so I
know what I'm doing
those look pretty even so now we're
going to smoke it out I'm going to take
this elf concealer brush that's really
tiny and I'm going to take password and
I'm going to go along going I'm just
going along the actual wing well it's
still a little bit wet this is where
that little dot is gonna come into play
because gonna act as my kind of guard to
know where to stop
okay so now that I have some that great
eyeshadow on it I'm going to take the
makeup addiction cosmetics small pencil
brush and just work on smoking it out
now I'm taking a clean morphe brushes
the in 5-1-1
any fluffy brush just to kind of soften
it up a bit and I'm gonna take some soft
ochre on this paint brush I have and
just clean up that inner part because
you can see it got a little bit
eyeshadow in it okay so if you're
wondering why I made those little you
know I kind of place that eyeshadow in
here is because when I look like this
you can barely tell it in there it just
looks like a nice kind of smoked out
wait usually people that don't have put
it on they'll just go directly along the
wing since I do I felt like you two
really lost a lot of that wing if you
would just went directly there but I
place in here and adds some sort of
smokiness in that little part so you
still have the shape of the wing see
what I mean see how that works out and
work on this outer part underneath my
eye
I'm just going to connect it okay so now
I'm going to take a black gel pencil and
place that on the outer corners if
you're wondering why I didn't do it yet
is because my eyes have been very very
sensitive lately so I was so scared to
put it in this part and then try to do
this on camera and that was just water
and being a fool but at least we got the
top part down which is what I really
really want you guys to learn so yeah so
now I'm just gonna risk it all and place
some gel liner in my outer inner
waterline now I'm just going to smoke it
out with more password can I apply some
mascara
to finish off this look imma go ahead
and highlight my face I feel like with a
bold wing you just have to glow on video
all the time all the time I'm gonna take
benefits Watts up highlight just as my
base you grab my mirror I'm a click I
know I'm doing without a mirror gonna
set that in place on a Stassi is so
Hollywood going to contour with benefits
hoola bronzer
put those back over there going to blush
up with NARS liberté pretty for lips I
wasn't quite sure what to do so I'm just
going to create a color I'm going to
start off with color range cherry
blossom I do have a code if you want to
use it and this is this is too bright
for my liking for this look I'm going to
deepen it up with Jeffery stars
dominatrix
so after lips are done drying you are
finished which I look you are sexy is
where a bold I'm so happy that you know
just win with this I was very inspired
by Jill's makeup and Sandra de luxe they
both do just fierce ass wings I'm spike
I want my wings to slay harder like that
so let me try it out we try not on my
eyes in my eyes shape because they
definitely have more lid space to work
with okay let me see how I can tweak it
ups a little good on me so I hope this
helped any fellow hoodie out there who
wants to try a bold winged liner or
anyone else who wants to recreate this
look thank you so much for watching if
you guys do like talk-through videos
like this let me know because actually
enjoyed it and I wasn't as nervous I
thought I'll be so other than that thank
you guys so much for watching and I'll
see you guys soon
