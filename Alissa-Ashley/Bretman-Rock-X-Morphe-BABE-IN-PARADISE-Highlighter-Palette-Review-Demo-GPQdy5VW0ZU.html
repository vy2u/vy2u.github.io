for today's video I am going to just be
doing a little antics probably in a
really short video ok I got the new
morphe and britman bathing paradise
highlighter palette and fan brush and
I'm gonna go ahead and just put it on
for you guys I actually got it a couple
weeks ago and I was like waiting and
then I forgot and then I was okay I want
to play a video and I want some leaves
in the background so could be cute to
match it so I'm just really extra for no
reason but I'm so proud and excited for
him to be having this collaboration and
you guys know I love morphe as well so
I'm just excited to show you guys how it
looks on me I've actually not used it I
touch with my fingers but obvious is
different than using it so it's my first
time using it so if you guys want to see
me use it then just keep on watching and
I hope you guys enjoy it so here's what
the packaging looks like as I'm sure you
guys just saw when I put it up and then
like mention it also has a fan brush and
mine got a little bit because I had it
in a really bad place so it got a little
messed I'm so sad but we're still gonna
use it it's really cute and here is the
palette whoo so pretty it says in the
inside Aloha Mahalo for supporting your
fav babe in Paradise growing up on the
islands gave me a diverse perspective on
life that I want to share with you hope
this palette captures the essence of
paradise beauty bye bitch
so those what it says on the inside and
then here's the palette itself like I
mentioned I move my finger around if
that's why doesn't look like new and
pretty but I'm just go ahead and show
you guys I know that my lights are super
bright okay so let's go ahead and get
some swatches I'm gonna go ahead and
swatch like all my cat scratch me I just
realized it I must watch all of them
right here because obviously I can't put
them all on my face so let's go ahead
and do that alrighty so here is the big
girl my brows I write baby girl here is
bit a girl and I would describe it as
like a whitish pinky highlight it
definitely has some pink reflex inside
of it that's really pretty
I'm not reading the names because i
swatched them a little bit on my fingers
when i post on my story couple weeks ago
but i even see the names
this one is vacation so here is vacation
i'll probably use that one because it
looks really really pretty and then next
we have mozzie oh dang i made to mix
them both let me see
I'm kind of like shearing it out of my
hand so you guys can see the texture
look how much like more shiny that is I
have a golden knuckle that one's pretty
I may have to use that one our mixture
of the two because I love golden this
one's get laid but the latest felt like
a lay I love love love the finish of
them because I love highlights that are
kind of like more on the shiny side I'm
almost drop the brush more on the shiny
side versus like a shimmer
I prefer shame because it looks really
pretty in the light then we have Chi
whoo this one very pretty and then last
you have shady bitch save the best for
last so this is shady bitch and I mean
obviously I think this one will look
really really nice on deeper complexions
cuz like a bronze highlight okay so now
let's go ahead and apply some highlights
and let's see I think oh I want to layer
two to try out too but I'm trying to
site if I should layer this one first I
mean the lighter on top you gotta make
sense huh that makes sense okay so I'm
gonna take ma who I take the brush get
some on the brush let's go ahead
like this why
hmm oh that's beautiful
our Nils right she was like cool it's
fire oh my god no tell me you think I
want your home don't tell me just like
it's fire I like it
it's Cece wants him to decide that's a
test I do with highlights to see if
they're legit it's not hella sitting on
my face I hate when highlights sit on my
face cuz that just means it's gonna look
like texture II and just like not
attractive and not cool but this one is
like sinking in before I even spray my
face look at a cute boo mm-hmm that's
more and then I'm gonna apply vacation I
honestly don't even need it because this
is so blinding but we're gonna do it
anyway and I'm going to the morphe and
britman event tonight to celebrate this
highlight palette so um be blinding
granted I may have went a little bit OD
but that's okay you can go OD sometimes
in life on highlight it is okay um let
me go ahead and get different brush do
my nose I don't like doing a fan on my
nose let's do the news I'm gonna take
almost took the wrong one my food for
the nose and it's the morphe m14 nine
ready and then because I want to figure
out a way to apply it some more I'm
gonna apply it right here take some
vacation take some on the brow bone
20 can wear out Sackett a because I want
to play more but I can't think of
anything I'm not wearing this shirt
tonight so I can't put on my shoulders
because they're never recovered
I'm gonna take a little bit of Chi who
and plot my lips and then really go
ahead and spray okay so here is what
we're looking like we're nice and glowy
and honestly speaking I think that like
my opinion is obvious I think that the
formula of the highlight is very nice
because it's not too thick and even like
I'm not sure if you guys notice but like
even when I rub my hand in it see how
it's not super duper powdery at all it's
just really nice and buttery I feel like
those highlights are usually the best
because that means that they're not
gonna really sit there and uh when you
call it what's the work what's the word
they're not gonna enhance texture
because they're so smooth and they look
really really gone to skin and nighttime
at daytime I feel like some highlights
are great for the night time when the
daytime look a little wonky this is so
beautiful
I'm gonna take photos tonight and I just
I like it and I'm happy and I am
supportive so you better go cop it okay
but that is it for this little video
hope you guys enjoyed it I know it
wasn't like super duper or like whatever
like I don't know I feel like whenever I
just we were you like one product that's
really short I feel bad but hey I mean
the backdrop is cute so you got to feast
your eyes on that but other than that
thank you guys so much for watching at
this little video and I'll see you guys
in my next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
