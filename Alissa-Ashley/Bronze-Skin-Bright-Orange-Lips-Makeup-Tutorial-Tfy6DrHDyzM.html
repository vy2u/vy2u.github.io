back to my channel so today's video is
just going to be me doing my makeup it
goes on to a cute makeup look so that's
obvious to you and try to be really
summery spring inspired so let's just
get started and see what I create I'm
going to start out by taking this
Melanie Mills psalm 2 deluxe it's a
peach deluxe body radiance and I used to
prime I didn't love this I use it on
Finnell yesterday and it literally makes
your skin look amazing like I was like
wow wow so I'm gonna go ahead and use as
a primer I made it put too much for us
okay but I'm quite sure what I want to
do today but I want more like do
something you have to wait too much
that's what Samantha's Mac in here okay
cool
leave my mirror you I'm doing with a
nice little tiki timsy tinman look but I
know it looks crazy right now but it
makes your makeup look at airbrush but I
kid you not I just below yesterday and
my skin looked unbelievable literally
life and death like without any editing
or a they look unbelievable like
alrighty we're nice and good and now I'm
going to take that's it I'm gonna now
I'm going to take the Make Up For Ever
Ultra HD foundation stick and okay if
you guys were to want to know what my
favorite foundation is this is
definitely going to be it because it's
my second time buying two colors and
okay with all our foundations honestly I
end up having to buy two shades of each
and it's so annoying because that's more
money but these are so worth it I don't
care my two shades to make some give my
custom shade because they're so amazing
I literally actually just finished up my
last ones they were like literally
I'll look scraping the biggest my face
because of how good they are I love it
so I'm making so much it gives a really
nice coverage but it still leaves you
nice and radiant it's just beautiful
like how can you not like I mean I'm
sure something don't like each other but
I love it I gave myself a fake tan last
night
which I didn't want off what I mean and
yes I guess I'll say can't I find to use
more of this dark shade in the light
shade so I used to chase why 5:05 and
why for four or five so if I just put a
little bit of why for four or five in
the center of my face but um so tell me
pricing and attend to my face but uh
keep the rest the darker shade because I
am more tan and I will yesterday so I
got a you know stick to the pan where is
my morphe bruise I needed I can't seem
to locate the brush I want to use it for
in this alley the morphe armpit the g8
or whatever it is bottom easy six still
pretty but I just melt that darn brush
but it's okay try not to mess up my hair
I've been trying like a new kind of hair
laying technique so I do it like
overnight so I can just wake up in the
morning and it's so pretty convenient
why would I've been doing this all my
life you know so if you guys want to
toriel on my laid hair to let me know
because yes i think i figuring out a
little recipe to make it lay really nice
okay and they were my foundation let's
drop stuff with my foundations I'd like
to just take us fun sometimes and just
tag in a little bit more and this kind
of removes any excess foundation so it's
not just lingering on my face for
concealer I have been loving the NARS
radiant creamy concealer in caramel and
use that use biscuit but caramel seems
to be a really nice shade especially
with this tan going on because sometimes
I forget to change my concealer shade
when I do my pan so is it looking way
too bright a caramel seems to be the
perfect shape so when I have a can I
still get a highlight but it's more
subtle so it is a little more gorgeous
I don't know I feel like whenever I have
a tan I don't like going for that whole
crazy over highlighted look a kind of
like your tone down the focus is more on
the can glow leanness of my skin you
know so I come down with it
so see how it's highlighting me without
looking crazy
yeah Carlos is a great shape and I have
my tan 3 and it was good it was better
than Vicki if I was in denial honestly
never I contour a little bit with the on
socket 6 foundation in the shade walnut
so cut right there probably like cat
scratch on sleep or something
they're crazy ones owl my foundation
brush too
all righty now I'm trying to make sure
it doesn't freeze up and I'm going to
take my cover X perfect setting powder
and just going to go into the eyes and
basically everywhere else to how most
people want to know why I blow on the
sponge before I go under my eyes
well that's because sometimes you know
your sponge isn't picking up the power
evenly so sometimes if I just get one
area with a bunch of powder that isn't
being my cakey spot if I have to get
that during the day and just taking up
really unpleasantly under my eye I like
to blow on it to make sure it's a really
nice smooth application what I'm getting
now CL is really smooth yeah low blow
for your life I'm also using it for the
rest of my stage - and the areas where I
want to say more mattified as you can
see in con just blending it in cuz
usually I'd kind of pack it on and I
take a brush and definitely the excess I
cannot pack it in and blend in with this
sponge because I know it'll last longer
and you want to make sure you're doing
this with a very almost like dry damp
sponge not too dry but not too wet
either because if it's too wet Guga
cakey and I'm going to take my Sephora
Michelson powder so we taking this in
the shade tan I'm taking the morphe e58
which I really love
especially for studying the bases as
that angle to it and it's still fluffy
so it just works out really good and I'm
just going to take that my Christmas and
go over everything sometimes I find that
like my highlight is kind of like
looking not seamless but take the Micra
smooth and go along this edge to kind of
blend them together see that it like how
this side looks a little more blending
where this side you kind of see how the
highlight is separate from there for my
face kind of take some microphones and
go along the edge and they really help
already now I'm on my spit and do these
brows I'm actually go ahead and do my
brows off no you can almost no
they're going to marketing you guys
would be like why do you all right no
they're come on fire so I guess I was
all thanks and do a browse on keep it
referred I've been taking my son not
before I'm loosing for my truth is the
BH Cosmetics to do pro waterproof brow
pomade this in the shade Auburn
I like this shade because it's not yeah
it's sometimes Auburn's
look super reddish and warm it's not
like that it's more cool tone so it
works out for the blonde the do blonde
hair so I'm go ahead and do that and
this is a dose of colors winged liner
brush
and then taking some tart shape tape or
go ahead and clean up my brows
I look at their be very very very very
very very simple I'm gonna take XSLT got
palette I'll give a few dose of colors
baked brown palette and this palette is
like everything you need in your life
I used it well in fact when I went to
that benefit trip and I like holy crap
like it's so pigmented I'm take this
shade right here and take my morphe MV
23 use that first then taking food dish
a right next to it and to get a little
bit of this shade right here focus on
outer corner
taking missed doses colors X's the
morphe brush there's both gold and white
this is a morphe brush I'm going to pop
call on outer part of the eye pain the
lightest shade in the palette just kind
of pop up the inner corner a little bit
and then to add a little bit of pink
eNOS to this I'm taking the makeup geek
to to Cannes Sun Tuscan Sun on our canal
trip which their light beam can be
flushing over the eye now I'll go ahead
and take this Becca is their new to me
but I've used a couple times they're
multitasking perfecting powder I'll get
the name right eventually like I'll be
able to like say without looking at it
but this is going to shave warm honey
and I'm going to take this before and
number 98 it's a highlighting brush but
I love to use it to chisel out my
cheekbones so I'm gonna go ahead and
take this powder as extremely pigmented
I've got to be a little bit gentle with
it I'll use that Cara my cheekbones
and then I'm going to you a switch over
to this Chanel bronzer and I got this
when I got that Chanel powder bag did a
little comparison for and this is like
one of my favorites now it's so
beautiful and I'm going to sweep this a
little bit over the contour just for
more warmth next thing this cream color
by Mac is their rich coral take my
fingers and I'm going to use as my blush
then taking me Fiat London dewy sticks
I'm going to go ahead and use it as my
highlighter base love this stuff for my
highlight I'm taking my fancy-schmancy
Dior highlight this is e your skin nude
and number three so Luminizer so pretty
and taking the Sephora highlight brush
which is what it's intended for
lightly Pat that on I love this
highlight because it's so it's so hard
to describe but it's definitely worth
the money i actually bought another one
I'm not even done with this one yet
because it's so smooth I love this
smooth highlight and then I let go of my
brows a little bit except eyes are
getting a little bit lost in my face so
I'm taking some powders from this don't
know which how does the FM kind of mix
and match to get a nice little little
deepening of my brows
now if you want a little more of a blush
so I'm going to take this Mac hushed
tone and I'm choosing this one because
it reminds a little bit of California
where it has that kind of highlight
effect to it so it doesn't look super
intense it's very shiny so I want to use
that am I go ahead and give myself a
little spritz with this glow Gator mist
I wander Beauty and I'm going to spritz
with the Urban Decay all nighter setting
spray sometimes I like multi frame and
the reason why is because the glow Gator
mist is going to kind of bring up the
globe and the all-nighters going to set
the makeup a little bit more so I kind
of get both working in action so I don't
look too mad I don't
- Chloe eat it so I've been doing that
lately it's working really great so that
is what I did so go ahead and dry this
off and they weren't popping on the
color and then we're ready look how nice
and tan and again I listen to take two
shapes and code rain I do have a colored
raincoat you guys want to use it I'm
taking to a brick house and one of this
daddy's girl
mix them ons which my lid color instead
of using the spiked punch I took the
letter grey instead and then I popped
then girls finto because I wanted more
bright and yeah here we have the
finished look and drinks every T is
parisa jeez I hope you guys like have to
go turn out if you did be sure to give a
thumbs up and won't realize that if you
did be sure to give a thumbs up and if
