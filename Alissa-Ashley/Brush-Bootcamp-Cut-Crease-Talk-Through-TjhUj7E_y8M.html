today's video is fresh boot camp and
this video I teach you how to achieve
this cut crease that you see right here
this video was originally supposed to be
from last week but I missed it because I
was just very very busy and I tried to
film it and it just it was in shambles
yeah like my eyes were just like no
Alyssa you cannot do it I tried it just
was not coming out good and even when
filming this I was running into a little
bit of difficulties by the sides just
keep pushing and show you guys any
mistakes I may have made just so it's
more relatable so if you want to see how
to achieve this Cooke crease then just
keep on watching also I'm gonna try to
figure out how to get a video up next
Friday and the reason why it may be a
challenge is because next Friday is my
move-in date so I'm gonna try to figure
out for you guys if I can't I'm sorry
I'm just updating you guys you know so
you don't kill me oh yeah yeah other
than let's just get to the video hope
you guys enjoyed and let me know in the
comment section down below what you want
next brush bootcamp topic to be yeah bye
I'm awkward okay okay so the first time
I do like always is just clean on my
brow I'm taking the mac studio finish
concealer at NC 42 and my morphe e 19
and I'm going to clean up my brow let's
include is in each video evils the same
just to show you guys always the same
process
I'm gonna go ahead and take my Urban
Decay primer potion of the shade Eden
davin the center I'm gonna take my
morphe e27 to blend this out we go ahead
and set in place with loose powder and I
was moving to the eyeshadow for I shall
today I'll be using my melt cosmetics
rust stack because I've been obsessing
over it lately
but I didn't want to you guys to go get
it because I understand that it's a
little bit more on the pricey side so I
didn't want you guys fill all of this so
I will still be making the morphe 35o
pop up right here because they have
similar shades I just want to use my
male rustic because I just needed switch
up a bit so first I'm gonna take the
shade antique and this is the shade in
the 35o palette you can use to achieve
the exact same look trust me and I'm
going to take this morphe in for one two
I'm taking this one because it's nice
and fluffy but not too big and I want to
use this just begin my crease cutting
I'm just gonna apply this all over my
lid first just like that favorite softly
and they wanted to do is just kind of go
in with the shadow and then kind of make
curve outwards whenever I do my cut
creases I find that it looks more
attractive on my eye shape because
they're hooded to wing it outwards so
that my eye is lifted and not being
closed off too much so I just like to
take the shadow and wing it out a little
bit
I recommend winging it out once you
start to run out of shadow on your brush
you're not getting too much shadow on
the outer corner and if you do just
sweep it in words and not outwards
because then you're shuttin up all the
way up here I'm going to fly that shadow
next I'm going to take the shade rubbish
in the rough stack and this is optional
you don't have to do this but rubbish is
a little bit more of a yellowy mustard
color which is what I want for today so
I'm just applying it on top again it's
totally optional to apply a second
the background color but I want to do it
just because I love this shade as you
can see it's not really making any
darker it's just adding a different tint
to the eyeshadow and then after applying
that I'm going to take my morphe m4 41
just to soften up the outer part of the
eye shadow I apply it because I think
that it would just looking a little bit
too a blend it's like to take this brush
just to soften everything up a bit in
between eyeshadow applications see looks
better looks better and now I'm going to
begin to deepen this up so I'm going to
switch it to the m16 9 because it is
smaller I do not want to use the other
brush I use because it may be too fluffy
it I don't know how deep I want this to
go so I'm going to take the shade rest
and again the morphe 35o shadows that
you can use are popping up right there
and I'm just going to place this all in
the crease area first I'm going to end
up taking this shadow up but it's always
good to just start in the crease and
build your way up as opposed to starting
up and then going down because then
you'll just need to look a disaster and
then I noticed that sometimes it's a
little tricky getting this little outer
corner to be as pigmented as the rest of
the eye so whenever I get to the outer
corner I just kind of brush inwards to
get that pigmentation for the most part
and I want to have all that shadow kind
of off the brush I then sweep upwards to
go back and forth until it's blended
now I'm going to take my m4 112 and just
soften that out because it was looking a
little bit rough and I'm gonna take that
same shadow in the same m16 9 and
continue to apply it until I'm satisfied
with how intense it is so as you can see
I fight a lot in the center and I'm
gonna go in with m4 1/2 and just kind of
move it back and forth to just
distribute it onto the eye as opposed to
just placing it all over and that is
getting a more even application and it
allows me to have more control so I'm
not just getting it all over and is
crazy so that's a good tip for you if
you are creating any I shall look
actually just kind of put the shadow
just put the shadow in the center first
and then kind of sweep it inwards and
outwards and then for this little corner
right here I'm just gonna put some
shadow inwards because this area right
here again is a little tricky to make
even so I like to push it in words and
I'm taking in for 1/2 which is just
soften it out next I'm going to go in
with my m4 3-1 and I'm going to take the
shade rot which is a nice deep brown and
I'm going to place this shadow closest
to the crease line I'm not gonna carry
this up too much because I don't want to
be oh Emily dark I just want this to be
on the crease line
and I just soften it out I'm gonna take
my in for 112 okay so now we have to
start carving our crease which is the
fun part
I'm gonna take my morphe e 19 which is a
really nice small brush that you see
right here and I'm going to take my mac
studio finish concealer and I'm just
going to coat the brush pretty pretty
evenly on both sides because that just
makes the application easier and it
makes the brush all nice and flat I'm
going to start in the little inner
corner and I'm going to go along my
natural crease first before kind of
extending it and make it a little bigger
take an a concealer and then I get to
the outer corner I like to kind of push
it inwards
I feel like the outer part of the eye it
just gets a little bit too it moves
around too much so I just like to kind
of push it inward and this right here
that's fine a little mess up normally
I'm freaked out but I'm actually
extending my crease so that is perfectly
fine
okay so as you can see when I open it
transfer to that area and that's
actually how high I'm going to carry it
and I'm just going to go ahead and just
kind of work off with that mistake I'm
not really making any bigger or
extending the crease cut in this little
inner corner it's mainly going to be
happening right in the center of the lid
and then when I get to the outer corner
I'm gonna push it inwards
okay so once that's on I'm going to take
my morphe m157
and I'm just going to kind of remove
some of that concealer you don't want a
super thick layer of concealer because
that's really really heavy for the eyes
so I'm kind of just kind of patting on
it to remove some of the excess because
we've already got a nice and carved so
we don't need a lot of concealer I
didn't take a lot of concealer to begin
with but still it's nice to kind of do
this just to flatten it out a bit and
then use that same brush I'm going to
take a little bit of colorless powder
and just kind of set it in place just a
little bit because it is nice and creamy
but we do not want to be nice if you
want to be matte and I'm going to take
the shape classic from the rough stack
and just pack it on top just to give out
a yellow tint to it so it all goes
together
and as you can see packing bad lighter
shadow on top kinda messed up our
neatness on the crease line so I'm going
to take the morphe in three to six which
is a really nice tiny brush I'm gonna
take the shades rot and rust and just
glide them along that line it helps to
lift your eyes so it's nice and tight
and not all saggy because then you may
get it onto your crease and you do not
want that I mean your lid you know what
I'm in now I'm gonna go ahead and take a
little bit of a break from the crease
because I may have to go in may not to
do any touch-ups but I don't like to
spend too much time on that crease
because my eyes are a little bit more on
the dry side so I feel like if I just
keep blending and keep working for a
long amount of time it may just end up
being a disaster because my eye is too
dry so I'll go ahead and take a break
from that and create a winged liner I'm
going to use the Tarte claypot Amazonian
clay waterproof liner and this in the
shade mint I want to use this just to
switch it up a bit and this is the liner
brush that came with it
okay so for finishing touches I'm going
to take the shade antique and rubbish
because those are my like transition
shades and I'm going to take the morphe
m4 ones well and just soften up that top
area and then if you notice the crease
is a little bit darker on the crease
line and it doesn't ombre enough I take
a shade rut first this is my morphe m43
one pencil brush and I'm just going to
place that along the lines of that line
I'm not going to go too close because I
don't want to ruin my lid I'm just going
along the crease line a very gently
and I'm going to take the shade rest and
go right on top and then go back in my
m4 1:12 and just soften them both at it
sup I notice legs terrible oh but um I
just was that my outro clip isn't
working and I cannot just not say
goodbye to you guys
