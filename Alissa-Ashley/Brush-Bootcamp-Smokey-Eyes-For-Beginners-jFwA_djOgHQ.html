today's video is going to be another
brush bootcamp this is segment two and
this segment is going to be on smokey
eyes and at first it was going to be cut
crease but then I did a crease other day
so now I'm okay I can't do to cut
creases in one week so that will be next
week and for this bootcamp it isn't
going to be as super detailed in depth
with you know cool brush close-ups it's
that I mean like that like the first
brush boot camp because that was the
basics and if you haven't checked that
one out be sure to do so because I
covered every single brush that I'll be
using for this entire series and that
one is just way way way more details
this one is going to focus on how to use
the brushes that I mentioned to create
these smokey eyes so you can follow
along at home because I was the whole
purpose of this boot camp is that I want
you guys just learn from home and just
follow along with me and I'm gonna give
you guys all the tips that I can
possibly have inside of me to make
creating a smoky eye as easy as possible
and for this video I decided to do three
I started off with the very daytime
wearable smokey eye and then it got a
little bit brown and then we built into
this really big blown out well it's
intense that's the word I'm looking for
intense black smokey eye the reason I
decided to do three is because I know
that not everyone wants to wear this so
but people do want to wear this if
people do want to wear a more softer one
so I decided to give you guys some
options so I hope you guys like it so
yeah if you want to see how I create
each three of my smokey eyes as well as
tips to make it easier and all that good
stuff then just keep on watching
by the way I do sound like this because
I am getting sick I feel like I'm
overworking myself by filming every
single day it's just yeah I don't like
to have a lot going on I'm just it's
very stressful month but I feel like
it's all gonna be worth it sorry worth
it as long as you guys are happy I know
I missed mystery makeup Monday that will
be coming Monday I'm so sorry like I was
shocked that so many people would like
we're looking forward to it I felt so
bad but favorite stressful month very
intense month but I'm so excited for
acceptin
and I hope that you guys are excited for
what's to come
so if you want to see all the smokiness
and hear me shut up then just keep on
watching ok so let's get started the
first thing I'm going to do like always
is prime the eye using my Urban Decay
primer potion and this in the shade Eden
and I'm going to blend this out with the
morphe e27 which is synthetic and I
explained why I like using synthetic
brushes to blend out cream products in
my first brush bootcamp so be sure to
check it out and then like always I'm
going to set it in place with a loose
powder so I have a nice smooth very soft
base next I'm going to apply my first
eyeshadow which is always a transition
shade this is always the first step for
me in terms of eyeshadow and this is the
morphe m3 30 a nice fluffy brush then of
course have to pack some powder on to
catch any fallout and I'm going to
continue to build that shade until I am
satisfied with it I use a lighter shade
first and then I gradually built into a
nice soft brown shade just to build up
that dimension and all that good stuff
it's important especially in a smokey
eye to apply your softer shadows first
before going in with your deeper shades
so that that shadow can kind of chill
and chillax behind the deeper shade so
it's just not one-dimensional and as you
can see I am going in with my deeper
brown shade just to build up the
intensity and to do this I switched over
to the m16 9 and I did that because the
m16 9 is smaller and I have more control
over my deep shade and then I'm
switching back into the m3 30 just to
soften it up and as you can see I'm
using that in 332 apply some more Brown
as well just because I know now where I
want that Brown to be that switch back
over to M 169 just to add more Brown to
the outer corner and I wanted more
control in the M 169 is smaller than M
30 I know it's a lot I know it's a lot
what I'm essentially doing is taking the
brown on the m1 69 and then softening it
with the M 330 just so I don't end up
with raccoon eyes just to build it up
you want to build up you don't want to
have to take
way too much and then I'm going to go
ahead and pack on a light brown shade
onto my lid with the m157 just so that
area isn't completely naked now I'm
going to take the e36 and I'm just going
to apply that brown eyeshadow mainly to
the outer corner because I want most of
the intensity to be there and as you can
see I'm taking the e36 just to pack on
even more Brown and I'm going to take my
m16 9 to soften it up and then here you
have it and as you can see it's very
very daytime wearable and I wanted to
show you guys a daytime wearable smokey
eye because I know that the black and
tint one isn't the most ideal so now
let's move on to the next smokey eye
which is a nice brown smokey eye for the
brown I started fresh on the lid I
cleaned it up primed it per usual and
I'm taking the M 330 and applying a nice
soft brown eyeshadow next I'm going to
take the m22 2 and pack on a cream gel
liner this is from morphe and it's in
the shade tain and I'm just packing this
onto the lid first and as you can see
I'm doing in sections and also when I
get to the outer edge I'm pulling it
inwards as opposed to out words because
this is going to make blending it a
little bit easier I'm going to continue
to blend this onto my crease area and
the way of knowing how high it is and
it's the perfect height is that if you
look up and you cannot see it that means
you may need to apply a little bit more
and then once it's visible then you can
go ahead and start blending it out I'm
taking this morphe 17 and this is
synthetic and synthetic hair brushes are
perfect for blending out creams which is
why I chose this one and again as you
can see when I get to the outer edge I'm
pushing it inwards so that I don't end
up with a mess and then I'm going to
blend it out a little bit with my finger
because it's nice and warm it's really
going to move that cream around
perfectly now I'm going to go ahead and
apply a brown eyeshadow right on top I'm
just packing it on and then slowly
sweeping it across I don't want to just
go in and sweep it because then it may
disturb the cream I just want to pack it
on very very lightly until it's nicely
on there with the M 330 and then I'm
going to take the M 169
pack on the brown shadow onto the lid
and this brown is a little bit deeper
because this is going to be the
smokiness to the eye and as you can see
I'm just applying it where I want it to
be and then I'm going to blend it out
with the M 330 and I like to do this
because well it's the same process as
the first I actually we're just a little
bit more Brown involved so I'm going to
take my m16 9 to pack on and then my m3
30 to make sure it's nice and soft and
sometimes to take my transition shade
just to make sure everything is going to
be nice and blended and I'm gonna go
ahead and apply a little bit more Brown
to the bottom part of the eye with these
same be 36 and then the I will be done
now the black is actually pretty easy
really easy in fact I'm just gonna pack
on some black eyeshadow right on top of
the brown because the brown is going to
be our peekaboo shade the shade that
sits on the back and we already have it
on so all you have to do is pack on the
black and to apply this black I'm taking
the m22 too because it's nice and snug
and it just fits really nicely into my
eye and then once I move into applying
this black eyeshadow more into the
crease I'm going to switch over to the
m16 9 it's just a little bit more fluffy
and I want something nice and fluffy for
the crease because I've noticed that
sometimes if I use a brush that isn't
fluffy enough it tends to kind of move
the eyeshadow all around and with the
eyeshadow it could possibly move the
primer so my eye shot doesn't really
look as nice and smooth as it should be
looking because I'm the teacher the
teachers eye shadow has to look good and
then to soften out the edges between the
black eye shadow and the brown I'm going
to take the Emma 514 I'm not going to
take the 330 because a 330 is pretty
fluffy
I want the in 514 because it's nice and
tiny and it's got really blend those
edges together it's look perfect next
for underneath the eye I'm going to take
the M 408 because it's nice and flat and
I'm just using this brush really just to
pack the black eyeshadow on top I'm not
doing too much blending just yet because
for blending I'm going to take my e36
I'm taking the e36 because it's
synthetic so it's much softer or such a
delicate area and I'm gonna go ahead and
sweep away any excess fallout and I'm
going to take the M 3 to 6 just apply
some gel liner to my waterline I'm
taking it in 3 to 6 because it's nice
and small and I just don't run the risk
of messing up the way I would have done
with M 408 because the in 408 is a
little bit bigger and then I go ahead
and just set that in place with some
black eyeshadow and then soften it out
with my e36 and some brown eyeshadow
just so it's not too black and then here
is this side done and this is our last
demo
so that is it for this little smoky eye
segment I really hope you guys enjoyed
it and took from it what you could and
there will be plenty more smokey eye
tutorial coming which is why I didn't
want to spoil it all for this video I
tried to like yeah I have like a lot of
ideas and they don't follow through
because I'm just okay maybe I should
save some of the fire for other videos
so I tried to keep it really minimal for
this one and I just want to go simply be
able to follow along you can do any of
the smokey eyes I showed with any other
colors which I will be doing in the fall
and the winter time what do I do I do it
