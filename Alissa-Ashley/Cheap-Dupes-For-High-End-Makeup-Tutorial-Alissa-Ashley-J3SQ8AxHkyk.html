today's video is going to be an
affordable dupes for high-end make
tutorial that is a long title and it
took me how long I remember it but I've
been seeing a lot of youtubers do this
and I'll link some my favorite down
below because like did that girl but
I've been seeing a lot of youtubers do
it feels like I want to try it out and
honestly it's like I'm just chilling at
home its heck ugly outside so I'm just
like you know why not play around on my
face and do something I hope you guys
enjoy this video and yeah let's get to
it
or wherever we're going look let's go
there okay so this could get high inside
and this is gonna be my like affordable
dupe side because I just played this in
my slave sign so I gotta respect it the
first thing I do is just illuminate my
skin I'm going to use the L'Oreal True
Match Lumi and I use that on the
affordable dupe side let's just put this
all over my face
gonna be illuminated whatever why my
free hand in the is if I don't need
a mirror hold on let's see I'm doing it
oh that smell pro like and this doesn't
give a nice glow to my skin you know
look oh nice and glowy and then for the
high-end side I'm gonna take this Kevyn
Aucoin
the celestial liquid lighting and it's
also an illuminator honestly I got
disgust on Jaclyn hill using it and
Rihanna's I'm just like why I buy this
it's so expensive but it's pretty it's
pretty much it you know I like his stuff
blow me but it all met mighty so as you
can see I employed
that's just a pimple I thought I didn't
blend it but it was just a freaking
imperfection
okay as you can see I'm nice and
illuminated on both sides so we're good
to go okay so for my affordable side I'm
going to take my Maybelline fit me
foundation this is dewy plus smooth in
the shade with my shade 3:30 I'm going
to take my Real Techniques sponge just
to blend that out I'm going to try to
use you know affordable Apple
applicators brushes and all that stuff
for the other side we'll take my YSL a
tint to chicon foundation and these
shade B 70 we just pump that boom I took
too much a key thing I went in my
freaking full face I'm messing up this
is hella expensive mm-hmm and I'm gonna
blend it out with a Beauty Blender wow
the smell of it must have really grew on
me because the only thing I really
didn't like about this foundation is
because super freaking like perfumey
like when I first got it I was like
about to die like I literally had the
worst headache when I first got it okay
okay so we're dis we call it correcting
i'ma take the la girl Pro conceal orange
corrector on my dukes I just place that
right under my eye I'm gonna blend it
out the only I don't like about the Real
Techniques is that it doesn't really get
all the way in the inner corner it's
only thing that's frustrating about it
but for the most part I really do like
this fun cuz really nice and soft so
just go in there then for the high-end
side I might take the Becca backlight
that's in the shade peach its backlight
targeted color corrector take my finger
my long guys nail could fit in the
actual thing so place that I need my eye
and I mentioned I think I mentioned I
don't even know how I feel a hundred
percent about this product I feel like
it kind of just adds an extra layer so I
end up creasing when I wear it but I
mean I think it does the job now on to
my concealer for the affordable side I'm
going to take the L'Oreal True Match
concealer this is the super blendable
concealer in the shade neutral
in four five like 4-5 I'm going to place
that writing my eye and for any high-end
sign I'm going to take my NARS radiant
creamy concealer in the shade biscuit
and then so I'll work on blending those
out
to set the two I'm going to take my
Maybelline New York shine free loose
powder in the shade medium for my
drugstore side I love this power so much
and it comes in a light one as well okay
so why that's chilling I'm going to take
my Laura Mercier translucent loose
setting powder for my high-end side and
I go ahead and set that side and I've
mentioned before but I feel like I have
a love-hate relationship with the Laura
Mercier I feel like it works best when
mixed with other powders I don't love it
as much on its own I just feel like
hands are looking a little bit chalky on
me just my skin tone and yeah it just
gives me some problems but I'm hoping
that is any problems today from sake of
the video go ahead and bust bust where's
my mind at it go ahead and dust off both
sides of my face and I'm gonna actually
use those powers to set the rest of my
face because you know they're setting
products so you can use them pretty much
everywhere so I'm gonna take my
Maybelline on this side
until I learn mercy on the other side
I'm about to come to you guys for my
dupes I might take the Black Radiance
pressed powder and this in the shake
half a I think it's really nice you know
contour shade I'm taking my morphe III
brush and just chose on my cheeks I took
too much it's great so okay but we're
gonna play it off right I'm just gonna
blend in
alright and then for the high inside I'm
going to take mine ours was this cause I
believe it's called blush it's in the
shade I'm not proud to name it'll pop up
alright and I'm gonna just lightly tap
into it this crap is very very very
pigmented so I just want to be very
careful with it
see I just it off all the excess and
it's still super duper dark so usually
very careful with these NARS products
because yeah they use the good stuff in
that lab so now for blush for my cheap
side I'm gonna take my NYX blush this is
a shade double dare and you want to tap
in this very lightly because this is
very very pigmented it's actually more
pigmented pigment the pigmented then my
height in blush I'm going to take this
very very lightly like super like I'm
actually scared lightly alright them is
enough and then for my high inside imma
take NARS Liberte
now I don't want to highlight after this
actually like to you know go into my
other stuff I like to highlight last you
know just to kind of give that Oh effect
so onto the brows I'm taking my color
pop bangin brunette brow I guess it's a
palm eight-count to the palm eight
because it does have a pomade texture
and then to finish off my little what do
you call it area whatever it's called
I'm going to take my NYX micro brow
pencil in the shade chocolate alrighty
so the pencils I need a little bit dry
but I can work with it so it's okay and
I'm going to move on to the high inside
before I go ahead and you know can see
you little Prime and all that stuff for
the high-end Simon take honest osseous
differ on the shape chocolate let's go
ahead and fill in the other brow just
dip brows dry as hell
hmm it'll work
and then to finish off this tale or
whatever you called it
I'm gonna take my mark take its Braun
while defining brow pencil and this in
the shade dark brown have about four or
five of these pencils I really do like
these pencils a whole lot
now for brow cleanup on the affordable
side I'm going to take some la girl Pro
concealer and shade pure beige and I'm
going to take my royal and langnickel
concealer brush and you clean out my
brow and prime that I
I'm going to set that and place my
meeting lead powder now for this time
and take my mac studio finish concealer
in the shade see 42 same brush same
thing
I'm gonna take my morphe 35o palette I'm
going to take the orange shade in the
palette and just go in my crease and
then from my high inside imma take NARS
Persia which is also in orange eyeshadow
go ahead and place those same exact
eyeshadows on the bottom part of my eye
this one actually came out of darker
because my brush was dirty but it's okay
just a little bit of brown eyeshadow so
it's no biggie
ten minutes later it took so long for me
to find a dupe of some sort but my men
take the L'Oreal infallible and brush
eyeshadow and like always I'm taking my
Mac mixing medium liner I don't care
what look I do I have to use it because
I put it eyes good place it on top and
then for the high inside take more Mac
mixing AM liner and then the eye shadow
choice is makeup geeks grandstand and
makeup geek is a relatively affordable
brand but you know it counts enough it's
gonna have to do you guys it's gonna
have to do then we go ahead and just
click those same shadows write it in a
corner like I always do feel like this
will definitely need some winged liner
so for my high-end side I'm gonna take
my Kat Von D trooper liner
and then for the Affordable siding we'll
take the NYX matte liquid liner and
here's an exact do print like that but
this liner is amazing it's my favorite
affordable liner now for mascara for my
dupe side imitate the Maybelline lash
sensational sensational put a little
mascara on and then for a my high-end
I'm gonna take benefits roller lash in
here I'll just show you guys why I took
both these two if I can get it open
okay as you can see both of them have a
curve to it okay so now it's a
highlighting I'm going to take my
Physicians Formula Vegas strip I've uses
before I really do love this highlight
go ahead and just really get in there
and then for this side I'm going to take
my body Brown a bronzed glow very glowy
and very gold now obviously I love
bronze glow
it's definitely smooth and the Vegas
strip it has a little more of a golden
tone to it and it just settles into the
skin better but both of them do a good
job for lip color I'm gonna do half and
half and for the affordable side I'm
going to take color pops stingray it's
the collaboration they did with it's my
rare day
and for my high-end side I'm going to
take line crimes teddy bear look at that
you guys look how freakin similar they
are now the last thing to do is just set
my face in place for my high-end side
I'm gonna take my skin Danai via
finishing spray obviously because you
know is the Navy's a little bit on the
pricier side and then for my cheap side
I mean let's get it started this is a
new one I'm gonna take my la girl pro
setting spray okay so here is the final
result I think I did a really good job I
think I you know definitely match them
let me just stop talking so you guys can
be the judge of it
