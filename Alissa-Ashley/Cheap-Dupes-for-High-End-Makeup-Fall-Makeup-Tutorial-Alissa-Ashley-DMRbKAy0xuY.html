in the midst of doing Halloween videos I
still want to be able to offer other
tutorials because I know that not
everyone's into Halloween so today's
video is going to be a cheap dupes for
high-end makeup tutorial and this is a
collab varietal inner here on youtube if
you have not seen her channel already
you are missing out because she does a
lot of amazing videos and she's honestly
always doing good videos to save some
money so be sure to check out her
channel and check out our video once you
are done with mine if you are not
familiar with cheap dupes for high in
makeup videos I've done one and I'll
link that down below but basically this
side is all affordable makeup and this
side is all high-end makeup so I'm just
offering you some dupes so that is how
this is gonna go down so if you want to
see how I get down with all this and
make this work so I can have it look
damn near the same it looks the same you
can't tell you cannot tell I did I did
that they just keep on watching and I
hope you guys enjoy okay so this side is
gonna be mine what I want this side to
be this I'll be my dupe side this size
would be the high-end side so for my
jump side for foundation I'm going to go
ahead and take the NYX mineral stick
foundation wait this makes this do the
lion side first okay for my hind side
I'm gonna take my hacia stick foundation
even though you guys already know when
my dupe side is gonna be but it's okay
and this in the shade amber go ahead and
play that to my eye inside and I love
this foundation I can't decide if amber
alone is my shade or if I mix of a cool
golden it makes more of my shade I don't
know yet but for the sake of mixing I'm
so head and just apply equal golden as
well just a little bit though cuz you
can see a little bit dark and then to
blend that in I'm going to take my
morphe e30 one
and then for my Dukes side I'm going to
take my NYX mineral stick foundations in
this is a shame
nine and ten so deep honey and caramel
take a little bit of deep honey
now they'll go ahead and blend it out
the same brush for brushes I'm going to
use the same on both sides because I
only use like morphe brushes so and
they're pretty affordable so does you
same long and a lot of you were asking
me to compare these two foundations and
honestly I'm as you can see I'm blending
it in and it almost looks like the same
I definitely think the next one is a
great dupe the next one is amazing I
mentioned it and quite a few my videos
actually as you can see it's just
blending in so nicely you came to tell
which side is which you wouldn't know if
I didn't tell you so that is a great
sign moving on to concealer for my high
inside I could take my NARS I keep
wanting to the dupe side first so I
think it's cool if I do the high inside
first I'm going to take my NARS break we
can see or in the shade biscuit kind of
running low
it looks looking applying a lot I know
but I'm just writing blow okay and I am
applying a lot that's why I looks like
it and it's my dupe side I'm taking the
L'Oreal True Match concealer it's a
super blendable concealer and this is a
shade in 4-5 this is strikingly similar
to the NARS radiant creamy concealer and
if anything is actually a little bit
more hydrating than the NARS one as you
can see the colors are just almost just
identical so it's perfect
I'm gonna hide on my forehead okay yummy
to do that
go ahead and just blend this out and I
guess for the sake of keeping it really
lowly on this side I'm gonna go ahead
and just use this oh wait no hold on
okay so for my high-end side I'll go
ahead and use my Beauty Blender and then
for my dip side I'm trying out this new
Real Techniques sponge at Anam it's
definitely not shaped like a BD blender
let's pink so we're just gonna see how
it works
cases a little bit tricky to get in a
corner but I mean it looks pretty
flawless to me yeah that's pretty good
that's pretty damn good I'm pretty
satisfied I mean it is something that I
want to use every Sunday probably not
have to squeeze it but it's okay for it
to be such a interesting kind of sponge
after my high-end side I'm obviously
gonna take my ler mer powder if you
watched one of my other videos you give
my little insider I actually pronounced
it like Larimer and have issues with its
Laura Mercier loose powder and I go
ahead and use that set this side and
then normally I'll take my Maybelline
shine-free powder that's my favorite
drugstore powder I'm going to try out
this covergirl loose powder it's the
professional it's in the shade 110 light
I'm really nervous because it's really a
hit-or-miss for extra powder so let's
just see okay let's go ahead and do this
okay um okay go ahead and wipe it off
and see the result huh Oh little bit
Oh looks fine wait you asked more time
oh there's some more PE - that actually
looks really nice I'm very excited right
now I thought that was not to work out
for my I inside I'm going to go ahead
and set the rest of my face with my
Sephora micro smooth powder I don't
think that this could I don't know to me
it's pretty affordable especially you
know it's a it's a for Brynn it's not
super high-end but we're just gonna save
the high inside because son filmmaking
is high and that's okay
and if my dupe site I'm going to take
this NYX no filter hashtag no filter
finishing powder and it's in the shade
golden it may be a little more yellow
I'm go drop it maybe a little bit more
yellow than the Sephora side I think oh
no actually it's fine oh I love to be a
little more yellow but I guess it's the
same so that's awesome both powders are
SuperDuper smooth and they're not super
thick as you can see you guys probably
aren't even seeing the powder actually
go on you're just seeing the face slowly
become a little bit mattify and that's
just how smooth the powder is moving it
to browse for my high-end site I'm going
to use my Anasazi a dip brow in the
shaped chocolate just to fill in my
brows and I'm gonna be using are maybe
holding this NARS mirror but I'm only
using this mirror because my other ones
too big and it may block me out but I
just want to let you guys know that much
heat nor anything I just need this
because this has a smaller mirror
I never God's will come out terrible I
never do this brow on camera because I'm
a lefty so I've to reach over and she's
really uncomfortable so just bear with
me okay
and then I go ahead and just conceal
that my NARS radiant creamy concealer
and then for my dupe route I'm taking
this BH Cosmetics Studio Pro waterproof
brow pomade and it's in the shade
brunette I think that this is going to
match I'm hoping it does and if it
doesn't we will make it work and I'm
pretty sure will
okay so it's a tiny bit more cool toned
than the Anastacio one so I'm going to
take this sheet what is this this is
Auburn because Auburn's tend to be more
warm and I'm going to try to just flush
it on top just a little bit just to warm
it up and then to conceal this side I'm
taking my L'Oreal True Match and we go
ahead and do the same thing as the other
side little just stream it to prime my
high inside and we'll take my favorite
too at the moment which is the Anasazi
of waterproof cream color and the shade
honey I've been using this in the last
couple tutorials and if you haven't got
already you should it's just pretty good
I have been loving on it real hard I did
not sound right go ahead and just
lightly set it with a little bit of
power like I always do and that's my
deep side I'm taking this NYX eyeshadow
base and this the one that looks like
your skin tones and number three a
little bit more creamy than honest hacia
one that's for sure I'm going to set up
with a little more powder okay so for my
high-end shade the first shadow or
technique palette I'm going into is the
Anasazi of Modern Renaissance palette
and I'm taking the shade real guard come
through voice crack it up and I'm going
to take this morphe in for 1:12 go ahead
and place this in my crease I've no idea
what kind of look I'm doing it's
probably going to be basic I know it is
so just expect something basic like 1
soften that out this is a blank brush
this is a more feet in 5 3 2
and if my dupe site I'm taking this BH
Cosmetics modern neutrals 28 colored
eyeshadow palette I'm taking this shade
right here you get that letter focus
taking this shade right here because
when I did the fingers wash it looked
just like the real cars let's see mmm
actually look he kind of prettier Wow
mm-hmm
burnt orange that's really beautiful
mmm go ahead and take this lighter
orange just softer that out of it the
pigmentation in this freakin palette is
on point I'm actually just kind of I'm
still quiet because I'm just like like I
wouldn't expect him to be this pigmented
so now it's okay like I gotta come
through right now so since this side end
up being so orange I'm gonna go in with
NARS Persia and to just kind of go on
top of realgar and try to make it a
little more warm so I can match up with
this eye I'm going to take this NYX
full-throttle
eyes shadow palette this is in the shade
color right it I've used it before I'm
taking that cranberry shade and take a
little a little touch of it just a
little bit just to warm up this side
because I'm trying to match as much as
possible okay yeah okay now they look
like awesome I'm gonna go ahead and add
a little bit of brown taking this shade
right here just place that close to the
crease just to deepen it up a little bit
and on this side I'm a taking Modern
Renaissance palette and this in the
shade Cyprus amber going apply that
now go ahead and create a wing on this
side I'm taking the two-faced sketch
marker and this is black
and then my Duke I am taking this nyx
the curve first time trying it actually
some pretty exciting I've always wanted
from high-end side and go ahead and take
benefits they're real I wouldn't be
using roller lash because I have a deep
roller lash but I cannot find my room a
so I'm just go ahead and use they're
real good for my deep side I'm going to
take the Maybelline lash Shin
sensational and it has the same little
word as royal lash it's like rounded so
that's I want these roller lash if you
don't find it that's okay as long as you
guys know for my high-end side for
lashes I'm taking these new bounce some
lashes in the style Serengeti and then
my dupe side I'm taking these I'll or
London and this is the luxe meek effect
lashes
okay so as you can see the lash band on
these Serengeti is pretty thick so um
let me just go ahead and take these off
I actually like the deep side better so
I'm gonna go ahead and just put the dupe
lash on this side as well because it's
the better so I'm going to put them both
on because I just want the eyes to match
and this side is so much more
comfortable and lightweight and I'm just
I'm here for it so I don't even really
want to like promote this specific pair
of lashes from doing some because it's
really thick I think you guys can tell
nice took a look at the eyes and I want
a little more intensity on that outer
corner so I'll take the info 112 and
back into my BH palette I'm take the
black eyeshadow and just deepen up the
outer corner and on this side I'm taking
my honest opcional Warren single
eyeshadow and since I know that it's
more pigment than the BH I'm still apply
a little more lightly and then for under
the eye I do want to be very nice and
smoky so for my high-end side I'm taking
this you a slim cream eyeliner this is
matte black oh that's creamy that's
beautiful gonna go ahead and blend this
out a little bit my morphe import 41
pencil brush and it's my dupe site I
would normally rock with my la girl Gel
glide pencil because as the blackest
black the black is black affordable niya
that I know up or the NYX one they have
a really good one but I don't have
either one of those right now
so I'm going to take this absolute New
York waterproof gel eyeliner and this is
in a shade twinkle black
okay so I didn't peep it but I mean I
think that I should have been smart
enough to know by the name that I had a
little bit of shimmer but it's not
showing through too much that's fine for
me because I need to be very mattified
now let's go ahead and move into the
rest of the face I'm going to take my
NARS Gina contour blush for my high
inside and this is a more fleet what is
this a 58
and then for my deep side I'm taking the
hashtag no filter finishing power and
it's in the shade mahogany by NYX
switching over to my infamous m-52 for
my high-end side take the NARS powder
and for my low and I'm Technic powder
okay so for blush it was kind of
difficult finding one because like I
have high-end blush but we're not cool
with Marc Jacobs renew boo I might go
ahead and just use this magazine blush
even though make a peak is extremely
affordable for some it may not be so I'm
go ahead and just use yeah I may use
mega see for this side so if this is
puppy law and this is my morphe e58 and
puppy love is just a nice pretty pink
and then for my dupe side I'm taking
this morphe palette and what makes it a
dupe is that you're getting I mean it's
technically speaking more pricey than
the one single mega peak blush by the
same time you get nine of them so it's a
better bang for your buck I guess you
can say so I'm taking this one in this
little corner right here for my high-end
highlight I'm taking my oh my god it's
broken my Laura Geller Gilda honey and
this is a morphe 61 brush do I just
highlight half of my Cupid's bow I just
highlight half of my nose how do I do
this
have I just how about I highlight this
little tip of my nose and then the dupe
highlight and get that part of the nose
and if my dupe side I'm taking my la
girl strobe light showing powder and
this is 80 watt actually better than
gilded honey Oh
in different lip color I hate to be
basically when do brown lips but that's
just what I'm feeling
okay so for my high-end side I'm taking
code rains whatever and honestly to me
they're one of the more affordable
liquid lipsticks because they're just
they're cheaper than other ones on the
market and the standard price but it's
still technically high in so let's go
ahead and just pop this bad boy on and
on ad oops I'm taking this Milani amore
matte lip cream and a shake of it so
here's the finished look I would have
put on a tote bag for smearing stuff on
earrings I February so yeah hmm I need
some plants because I am so proud of
this I'm so proud of this like this is
