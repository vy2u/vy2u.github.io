necklaces hey guys welcome back to my
channel so for today's video to be
brutally honest with you guys I had no
idea what the heck I was going to film
because obviously I've been gone for a
little bit you know becoming in my a and
that's something that we'll talk about
later but like I was like okay what
video are gonna give them when you come
back like what are you gonna do Alyssa
and I really could not think of anything
and then I was just thinking and I was
like hmm
I don't know I just kind of want to do
something very lightweight and just not
a review that's intense and just not an
impressions and just all this like just
and I feel like everything now just like
just reviews and just on what
seriousness and I just kind of wanted to
do something a little bit different but
still kind of just me and I thought
it'll be fun to ask you guys and to show
you guys what part of your makeup or
what part of my makeup I need to feel
the most me and I want you guys to also
answer that on below what part of your
makeup routine are just your base or
whatever when you're about to go out of
the house what do you need to feel your
best and to feel your most confident and
I just want to ask that because I mean
it's just such a simple question and
also I just want to know what you guys
feel the most label in whether it be
your highlight your blush your contour I
know some people can't leave the house
other contour on anything I just want to
know because I mean I just I wanna have
some fun so I want to know what you guys
cannot leave the house without and I'm
gonna show you guys what I cannot leave
the house about and we're just got some
fun where I take some photos and it's
just gonna be cool and chill vibe so I
think it's perfect for this Monday so if
you guys want to see me do what I just
explained then just keep on watching and
I hope you guys enjoy it
what's missing can you tell can you put
it out hmm
can you bet you can't but you can my
brows they've been through a lot you
know I see so because I started getting
to makeup when I was about 14 I mean I
had interested in because I used to sit
there and watch my mom do her makeup but
I started doing my own little stuff at
14 I was
ninth grade and yeah I when I first
start doing it my brows they looked a
disaster I'm gonna try to find a photo
I'm just trying to find photos on my
brows and I used to do them but when I
first started they were a disaster
because I used to sit there and I used
to watch my mom do her brows and she had
a little razor thin little yellow when
you get them the views my story you know
I'm talking about and she would shave
them all off basically and just have a
little line of brows like everyone used
to think my mom was mean because her
brows were just so like just like she
looked me because my brows sorry mom you
watching this but she looked mean cuz
the brows but I mean it was the only
like person I saw who did their makeup
so that's why I learned from so I tweeze
them all off and I had the skinniest
little brow ever like I had yes actually
let's go ahead and demonstrate what I
used to do that's what I used to do to
my brows and I'm gonna insert a photo so
you guys can see how you steam eyebrows
probably the exact same but I used to
beat on some crazy stuff you know what I
mean and honestly brows such a trial and
error thing but I used to really take
them very seriously and I used to just
love to my brows that's my favorite
thing and also I feel like after I
realized ylist you shaved up all your
brow I became extremely insecure about
the fact that I had no brows hell I
still feel like I have no brows even
though I have so much more hair than I
used to have my brows in fact it used to
be so bad that I literally when I was
dating on this guy I was so insecure
when I would go to his house whatever
and like sleep over and everything that
I would bring a brow pencil and before
he would wake up in the morning I would
wake up so early and I would go pee in
the bathroom and I would just put back
on my bras because I knew that when I
fell asleep I smeared them off I used to
do my brows before bed because I did not
want to go to sleep without brows and
when I wake up in the morning you
realized oh my god my brows are gone I
would go and put them back on I'm sure
he knew okay like brows are fake but I
just didn't want him to see my real
brows and I heard one time one time I
did not have a brow pencil and I was
just like I was literally free
I was like what the hell am I gonna do I
don't know what I was gonna do and I
ended up taking a black pencil and I
just I made it work I looked terrible my
hair was light brown but I did a black
pencil because I did not want him to see
my brows if you would ask me
elissa what's one thing that you have to
have before you leave the house I would
say brows because I cannot leave the
house without brows so let me go ahead
and take this off I'll say wash it off
I'm like I'm not going to ruin my bus to
my beat and what I want to do before I
do my brows is I actually set up my
camera stuff over there so we're gonna
go ahead and hop over there and I want
to take a few photos without any brows
on because that's just gonna be a big
step for me because I always have to
have brows and even it's like right now
I feel so not complete and I feel so
like ah I need my brows so I thought
it'd be fun to just kind of take you
guys into my photography world over
there just to introduce it to my channel
and we're gonna go ahead and take some
snaps or not snaps because snapchat is
canceled because they updated or it
tasted photos without any brows on so
let's go ahead and hop over there and
let's see how we revive it over there
okay so oh right oh there you go
so here's we're working with I have this
light right here and this big thing I'll
let everything pop on the screen for you
guys and then here's my camera say hello
to that I have a monitor right here
which normally shows me the photos but I
am using it for my video so I can see
you I'm doing and then back here it's
kind of a mess in here honestly I have
two lights that are gonna flash on to my
backdrop so that we get some good
backdrop backdrop to it so that is our
set for today okay
ready to go if you hear like an air so I
think it's because it's a built-in fan
and the light that's keeping it cool
because these lights get hella hot like
right now hot I was freezing right now
ha I want on the AC but then you guys
hear a lot of noise and the sound that's
pregnant that good right now so I won't
put you guys through too much but to
take these clothes I'm using this is a
little odd what you can call it it's a
watchful call it this is for a shutter
release because I cannot press the
button on my camera because obviously I
do who are making it so I have something
connected to the camera and then I have
this in my hand to take the photos I
have all that link down below so you
guys can check that out but this is how
I take my photos on my own and then I
also have another button but this one's
pretty cool so me standing position so
see how whenever I press the button all
my lights power off it's all powered by
the thing that's on top of the camera
and that basically connects to all the
lights because on zebra and that's just
how this stuff goes if you guys want
more of a detailed sort of situation let
me know and I'll break it all down but
that's how all the rain of fire ops I'm
having one two three lights going at
once
usually at four I mean I need more for
today I just need this one
alrighty I think we got our photos let's
go ahead and go back to the video
section and let's check them out we're
back over here I swear it's like
bouncing back and forth with all just
this electronics it shocked me so much
I'm like but I went ahead and I
downloaded the photos onto my phone with
some good old Wi-Fi in the camera so now
let's go ahead and check them out
oh wow I feel so incomplete within my
brows my base is flawless but I feel so
incomplete I don't like it
more my look the more normal it feels so
maybe like I can char myself to not do
my brows on one of these days but we
know that I need my brows so let's go
ahead and do them and let's just talk a
little bit more and let's just do a
rouse so my favorite brow brush at the
moment is the Mac 263 I'm actually gonna
buy another one today let me remind
myself to do that actually in my notes
I'm gonna go ahead and just kind of like
wipe it off because I use a lot of brow
wax based brow products and my brush
gets kind of stiff and I do not want
that and in the current product that I'm
obsessed with my brows is the NARS brow
my backdropped is felt okay
it's the NARS brow defining cream and
this is tanami and I love love love of
color and I also love the texture of
this product because it kind of saves me
on having to use much brow gel because
it's so waxy that it holds it in place
for you so I'm gonna go ahead and just
dip into that and we're gonna go ahead
and do our brows so I like to just go
ahead and make little brow strokes like
so until I build into a really nice
naturally thick brow
and then I'm gonna go ahead and take eco
brow and this in the shade Rita and the
reason I'm taking this is cuz this gonna
add a little bit more of a depth because
this is a warm toned brow product but
this is a little bit of a more cooled
down it's not great which is why I love
it so much but it is definitely on the
cooler side and it just kind of goes
really well to my hair but I do like
some warm tone in the mixture let me go
ahead and just show you guys on my hand
what I mean I'm pretty sure you're able
to kind of tell the tone on my hand so
this is very warm see that kind of
reddish that's really really warm and
then let me go ahead and swatch the NARS
one so you guys can see what I mean so
see how the NARS the NARS is kind of
warm too but you can still see that cool
tone you see that see I'm just gonna
like poke this through
and i'ma go ahead and take some brow gel
this is the brow gal by Tanja crooks and
this is just their clear brow gel okay
so here is one brow done and honestly
the shape of the brow always changes but
lately I've been really liking a more
thick brow only because I feel like it
just makes my face look more young and
I'm sure you guys I've heard that before
we're like thicker brows kind of get
associated with youth whereas a thinner
brow is just more bold and like sexy
women like but I've been really liking
the more thick brows that is what I do
so let's go ahead and just do the other
brow and then we're gonna see our little
transformation because I feel like brows
they really do frame the base and they
just pull everything together okay so
here are my brows done it instantly I
just feel so much more confident and I
just I just feel like myself and I feel
cute and I feel great so now we're to go
ahead and go back over there
we're gonna take some photos with our
brows on and then we're gonna come back
over here we're just a bounce back and
forth I'm so hot we're better
we have brows
brennick you got the photos up Quint
bounce back over there alright let's go
ahead and have a look at the photos Wow
for one these bras came out amazing am i
right oh it does look so much more
complete and I just look so much more
happy let's go ahead and just come and
get like a little side-by-side
comparison to see what those brows did
for us yeah that is what it did amazing
overall I definitely can say that my
brows give me so much more confidence
and honestly the I guess message of this
video or for one I want you guys to
answer the question what's one part of
your makeup that you must have whether
it be browsed some people like lashes
lip gloss blush
what's one step in your makeup that you
cannot not go without for the day what's
one thing that you need comment down
below because it's just fun it's just
fun to talk about these kind of things
and honestly like when people say oh
yeah like you know you need makeup to
fill this you need make-up to fill that
honestly to me one I'm gonna say screw
you because your comment is deriving
from such a negative little hater place
but also there's nothing wrong with
wanting to use makeup tools to enhance
our features and to feel more confident
there's nothing wrong with that so I'm
so down for it because honestly speaking
if I didn't have a brow pencil or a brow
products I would not know what to do
because I love having my brows even like
to wash them often in the day that is
okay I feel great now and I feel happy
so I just want to know what part of your
makeup routine makes you feel the most
happiest and what part of your face you
have to have before you leave the house
because just fun so that is it for this
little video hope you guys liked me
adding the little photography over there
hope you guys liked that if you guys
want me to kind of add in more
photography stuff whether it be you know
like the perfect face for flash
photography all that stuff let me know
I'm just excited too
to introduce it and slowly bring it into
my channel this is what this video kind
of was for me so let me know your
thoughts but other than that thank you
guys so much for watching and I'll see
you guys on Wednesday peace out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
