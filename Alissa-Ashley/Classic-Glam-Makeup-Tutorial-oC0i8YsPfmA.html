makeup look that you see right here I
have just been dying to use some sort of
red I just I just want to do red and I
decided to pair it with this nice brown
kind of golden eye at first I was into
the classic black winged bias but like
that's expected so I want to do
something nice and smoky I've just been
feeling smoking it's feel very smoky

about that as well other than that
thank you so much for watching and let's
get to the video okay so the first thing
we do is go ahead and spray my face with
my Scandinavia make a primer spray then
I'm gonna take my Laura Mercier
foundation primer in the shade of the
shade radiance bronze see I'm not
for foundation I'm gonna take my curve X
natural finish foundation the shade in
70 and I'm sure you guys are so used to
me using this foundation it's actually
amazing and I'm so happy because after

feel terrible sorry I hope she likes it
for concealer I'll be taking my NARS

biscuit place that under my eye if you
just gotta Mia wrap this circle so that
I stand while you sit in speak my mind
because there's so much Sun to set my
concealer I'm gonna take my Laura
Mercier translucent powders I'm gonna go
ahead and make sure there's no creasing
under there before I said it
because then I'll just Issei the Cree
thing I'm not want to that
as you can see I'm switching to a
different sponge because this one is a
little bit more dry because if it's too
wet it's going to really pick up the
powdery thickly it's going to give you
really cakey under eyes now that had the
same power to set the rest of my face
and it seems like I'm applying a lot of
powder but that's because I am and I'm
doing this because once I start to bump
it into my skin I'm not gonna get any
streaks okay so I went ahead and got
closer I my taking my mac studio finish
concealer and my concealer brush roll a
nickel go ahead and use this to prime my
eye you guys should be so used to this
because this is all I use and I go ahead

makeup Peaks americano and place that in
the middle of my crease and I gotta
bring this up I'm just placing the right
in the center far in my crease area and
I'm taking a morphe m51 eight brush to
do this
for my lid I'm going to take a royal and
langnickel large concealer brush it's a
Mac mixing medium liner and just place
that all over a really really thin layer
and I'm going to take this eyeshadow
color drain just place it all on top I'm
mixing two eyeshadows together to give
me a nice kind of brownish coppery shade
and on top of that I'm going to take a
really really fine gold glitter by
Makeup Forever next we'll take makeup
geeks eyeliner pencil and this in the
shade espresso and the plaudits all in
my waterline then we use a zoeva luxe
pencil brush just to really really
smudge that out let me take local bear

go ahead and pop off some lashes this
step is optional but I just love lashes
whenever I do a nice pigment on my lid

warm my face I just want to contour
