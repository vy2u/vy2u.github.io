like this mountain okay
okay look at the camera look at me can
you look at me can you look at me can
you hmm
oh god that's my liquid lipstick hey
guys Oh max my channel so today's video
is gonna be a cruelty-free
makeup tutorial I decided to do this
because I don't want to go for a while
and why is my cord moving stop it
I didn't want to do this for a while and
I kinda just want to do a makeup
tutorial that had more of a purpose and
not just a slave a look so I'm really
trying to work on doing that lately so I
decided to do a cruelty free makeup
tutorial I went ahead and searched
online to see which brands were cruelty
free and I use them in this video so
hope you guys enjoy it and yeah that's
basically it be sure to subscribe and be
sure to turn on the notifications I know
you guys don't want to hear me have to
tell you but I have to now because
YouTube is just shambles
okay that's an example but other than
that let's just go ahead and jump into
this tutorial I hope you guys enjoy it
patient I'm taking my coverfx natural
finish oil-free foundation and you guys
I was so freaking mad because the whole
time I thought I was the shade in
seventy and I went to the store and I
was like food hmm so I went ahead now
just trying got three shades and I'm
actually like a g80
and if my brush I'm taking this Kat Von
D's that glitter on it oh my god for my
breath and taking my Kat Von D number
ten brush I go ahead and just apply this
to my skin see it matches me exactly
down to the tone and everything
next time I go ahead take my tart shape
take concealer it was actually pretty
cool you know researching which brands
are cruelty free because a lot of them
are brands that are already used but
some of them my friends that I use and
they yeah they're they're bad they're on
the naughty list so I definitely want to
go ahead and just kind of like you know
do my research and see what brands are
offering things that are cruelty free
because I didn't think it was gonna be
this easy to find things that are
cruelty free from brands that are
already loved so that makes sense
basically I'm excited now to go ahead
and set my under eye with my cat
colorless powder as you can see I went
ahead and set one side because I kind of
just want to get a visual because I have
it uses power a long time and as you can
see it kind of just washed out my color
a bit so I'm show you guys how to fix
that if you ever have that problem I
usually like the pressed powder over the
loose powder but I don't have it because
I hit pan on it and it's gone so I do
use a loose powder it's still very
flawless powder and it does not crease
whatsoever and looks nice and flawless
by the same time as you can see it looks
a little wash you know I mean so I'm
gonna show you guys how to correct that
problem if you do have it and I'm gonna
go ahead and side the rest of my face
with my NYX hashtag no filter and this
is the shade golden all its gonna mix in
a little bit of the cat powder because
usually I'll do my Laura Mercier but not
today
and then to minimize that kind of wash
look you see out of my eyes and go ahead
and just take that powder the hashtag no
filter
and just place that right on top of it
so I'll still get my highlights but
it'll just be better looking okay so one
I done I did this kind of like fall up
because I got inspired by look I do like
last year when I look for actually cool
and I'm boring but anyway I do this so
I'll go ahead and do this one on camera
now I normally have my little cool zoom
ins but my self is under construction
right now so I'm not gonna zoom in by
promise it's like such an easy look to
follow so let's go ahead and get started
on the eye for my brow I'm taking my BH
Cosmetics Studio Pro proud pomade and
it's in the shade Auburn and BH
Cosmetics obviously is closely free
otherwise they would not be in this
video I will go ahead and just fill in
my brows
and into cleaning up as well as prime my
eye I'm taking my tart shape tape
concealer and this is a dose of colors
concealer brush let me go ahead and
blending it out with this shader brush
also by those with colors any brush you
see this one's so dirty I got dirty
that's white it has a little kind of
like the rolls gold little handle that's
a dose of colors brush then go ahead and
lightly set it with my colorless powder
and then taking this brush by BH
Cosmetics it's their oh this is v6 go
ahead and take the studio pro the same
values my brows I'm taking that in my
face for eyeshadow I'm taking this what
is this oh no wrong shadow I have two
that I'm using today from Mel cosmetics
this one is probably the rust stack and
it's a shave rust and this is a zoeva
t-28 brush I'm just taking this brush
and go ahead and just set all that
studio pro in place
and I'm taking the shade was this unseen
from the first rest not restack just the
melt stack it's not rest I forgot what's
call it dark matter and I'm gonna use
that just to soften it out taking that
dose of clothes concealer brush and I
wiped it off and I'm using the studio
pro right underneath my eye and I'm
basically just repeating the same steps

on top I'm also gonna take the shade
superstar also by code rain and I'll pop
that a little bit on the lower part and
I'm also putting my flappy folds now
creating the wing is actually pretty
simple and take this color drain
electric green I'll pop a little bit on
the back of my hand and I'm gonna take
this liner brush by those of colors and
I'm just gonna dip into the back of my
hand and I'm just gonna create the wing
it's almost like creating a wing that's
black with cream liner but you're using
liquid lipstick and it's orange
I'm gonna go ahead and apply a little
bit mascara this from julep it is their
length matters and if the lashes I'm
taking these House of lashes I know

palette with my contour powders as well
and if my highlighter I'm taking this

dose of colors fan brush I think this is
not applying it like as intense as I
want to though hold on this is their
setting powder brush
and then for lacan I'm taking my dose of
colors chocolate wasted I want to put a
little bit of color reins spiced spiked
punch in the center so that is it for
this makeup look and I love how it
