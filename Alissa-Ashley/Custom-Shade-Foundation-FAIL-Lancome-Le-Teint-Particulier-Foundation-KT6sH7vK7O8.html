for today's video we'll be trying out
the Lancome custom foundation it is
called
latents particular year they have fine
pronounce it and I actually got this
made for me a couple days ago and I went
all the way to freaking San Jose and
that's like an hour away from me traffic
was horrendous on the way back home but
I decided to go ahead and try it out
because I've been seeing videos honest I
want to try for myself and what it is
it's a custom little makeup foundation a
little service and what they do is to
sit you down they ask you what your skin
type is mine is dry they want to know
what kind of foundation you like full
coverage sheer coverage medium coverage
and then they go ahead and take the full
device and they just beat your face in
different areas to see what your shade
is they decide your shade to determine
your shade based on that little match
and they use for the device after they
make your shade that go ahead and test
it on your skin and you can modify it if
you are not satisfied you can joke a lot
darker
I want a lighter for me personally
accident have it starting a little bit
because I I want a little more tan and
yeah overall the service was pretty cool
and I enjoyed it it was really cool just
into the custom-made for me but now I
want to go ahead and try it at home
because as you store obviously it's
different lighting so it may it look
good in that lighting but I want to see
it and my lighting and also they use
their Lancome brush and I do not own
that brush I do not have the plans on
purchasing of that brush so I want to
try it with the tools that I would use
at home to see if it works the same and
if it's really indeed H too much because
I have not tried it since I got it at
the store so so here's the Fox once you
get it in my lights are way too bright
but this one looks like and then you
open it up my middle you open it up and
here is your foundation and mine says it
was customized exclusively for ELISA and
it has a complexion idea
action number so that way you're able to
get a replenishment if you decide that
you want another foundation made for you
and you don't have to go to the whole
process again they get to look up your
ID and they can make it on the spot at
their locations that they have the
service provided because there's not
many many locations as to drive all the
way out about the quasi one to me
so they're not gonna be everywhere maybe
I'll add more we will see but here it
looks like you get 0.7 fluid ounces of
product and it overall costs me about
eighty seven eighty eight dollars in
that range after tax
so basically $90 for the foundation so
we're going to go ahead and try it out
let us see how it works and okay maybe I
should Klein first I'm gonna go ahead
and prime first because it's what I
would normally do I'm go ahead and take
my Milani prime light primer and while
that's soaking up I want to go ahead and
compare it to a foundation that I
already own that is a pretty accurate
shade match for me this is the stellar
foundation this is number s twenty go
ahead and swap that on my hand swap go
ahead swap that on my hand
so here's the stellar foundation really
nice match really beautiful foundation
and here is the Lancome one right next
to it and go and pump it out okay so
according to Lancome that is my perfect
foundation so either it is not accurate
or I am doing something wrong with the
foundations that I currently own so
let's go ahead and write out a go-ahead
pump about two pumps
oh the pumps gonna mess it up about two
pumps onto the back of my hand
and I want to blend out one side with
the Beauty Blender and the other side or
a tart blender the quickie sponge and
the other side of the brush just to see
the difference in comparison so go ahead
just dots
quick piece of lip line nose and
soldering ah go ahead and dot the
foundation onto my face I'm gonna go
ahead and blend this side with the Tarte
sponge Leslie Iwerks
mm-hmm so it's definitely not blending
as easy as other foundation pad if you
look right here as you can see each time
pounds up it's kind of getting blotchy
so maybe the foundation isn't the best
of the sponge just my little conclusion
already because it's not gonna blending
that well oh gosh
okay she whew all right so here is with
a sponge and um ya need to blend down
the neck a little bit because it's give
me a little gray cast under here and I
might use this more pg8 because I
discover that method on this side okay
who definitely been spins blends better
with a brush for sure this little patch
right here is just not really blending
is give me a lot of brushstroke and it's
going to take your sponge mmm I don't
see like with some area it just wants to
pick up the foundation maybe it's the
consistency of it but it seems like some
areas a little more tricky to blend
which is a little annoying but yeah
there we have it okay so I went ahead
and took some photos on my little selfie
camera and took some lip splash and
without flash okay so here we have it
without the flash and without the flash
it actually looks like a pretty decent
match and then we have it with the flash
and with the glass it looks like it is
way too freakin light for me it looks a
little mask I'm like what's going on the
width of the flash it looks kind of
Craig gray it looks a little bit too
light and what's interesting is that I
have them adjust it to be a little bit
darker so that's kind of made me wonder
okay like how much lighter was it when
it was my initial kind of matte to me I
don't know it's a little concerning but
it looks a little bit too light up the
flash on so I'm not really feeling that
now realistically speaking can I Vanessa
and they
origami absolutely because I know what
I'm doing and I'm a financier but at the
same time do I feel like I'm happy about
having to finesse a foundation I've
spent $90 on that's supposed to be my
perfect match
absolutely not I think that's really
annoying because it's like dude you were
$90 okay so my final verdict on this
foundation is that yes I personally
probably would not recommend spending
$90 on something that's not going to be
100% accurate I don't know that's a
little bit disappointing especially
seeing as though the price point is
pretty up there for our foundation and I
was expecting to kind of match me dead
on my skin still clicks in but it gave
me a decent covers it seems to be a
little bit tricky blending in this area
right here which I'm not really quite
understanding because it's the area I
want to cover the most because I get
dark around here so in terms of blending
it's just a little bit tricky blending
it kind of looks a little bit patchy to
blend and it was a little frustrating
because you just kind of blend and buff
and buff and buff and it's kind of scary
because by the time you're done buffing
is getting rid of most of the comic
coverage you know I mean so overall I'm
not a huge store biggest fan of this
foundation I definitely have foundations
that are more affordable that match me
better and that feel better easier to
blend and just overall just you know
better foundations so I definitely won't
be repurchasing this if you do want to
try it out just for the sake of getting
something custom we made for you then I
definitely say go for it because it was
a fun experience and the ladies that
helped me were really nice too but at
the same time it's like it was $90 and I
just would not I can't see myself
spending $90 on foundation that is maybe
July for me again so that is my final
little verdict if you guys like these
kind of videos where I basically go
ahead and send my money for you guys try
out products once you guys know before a
bit let me know because I'm down for it
and yeah that is it for this video
