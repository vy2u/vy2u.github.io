today's video is going to be a drug
store favorites video and yeah at first
I was initially or originally going to
just sit down and talk about other
products and I realized one that was
probably pretty boring because that's
just me talking and - I have a
stuttering problem so it gets really
hard for me to just talks in camera as
opposed to just doing stuff doing things
makes it easier so I'm going to go ahead
and just talk about my products as well
as put on my face so you guys can see it
all come together and you know see why
these are my drugstore favorites so if
you want to see that and just keep on
watching because yes you guys wants it
so yeah okay so first I'm going to prime
and this is a Milani prime light primer
and the reason why this is a favorite of
mine is a new favorite but it's
definitely one that inspired is because
I like the fact that it has this weird
sort of vibe to India mess on my hand
okay you see it and then when you rub it
in it has a nice illuminating factor to
it but it also it's not shiny you know
each I mean like it's not it's not oily
so it gives you that nice illumination
without being super shiny because
sometimes when you have a super oily
primer you're making into little greasy
because obviously you know like your
bribing looks on the hair oily so this
gives me that nice illumination without
giving me away so I really appreciate
that this nice mixture okay so for
foundation I had two drugstore favorites
so but I'm going to use this one
obviously because this one's a little
more new more popular right now and if
you've been dying to try it now I mean
maybe you will decide to you because
it's your fame saved and this is the NYX
total control foundation I'm sure you
saw that coming and this is just a great
foundation because it has really nice
velvety I'm going to put it on a nice
velvety finish and then let me go ahead
and blend this out
it starts dropping on too much freaking
eyeball and this is a morphe e6 brush i
like this one because as someone with
dry skin sometimes foundations like
these do any mix or medicine but this
one does and it does because the finish
of it is velvety and it looks like skin
as you can see it's not all powdery
because some drop on nations do kind of
have a powder like affect this one
doesn't do that so it works out
beautifully now for concealer this is
definitely my top drugstore concealer I
have bought this at least 10 times no
Federation and this is the L'Oreal True
Match concealer and it's in the shade in
4-5 and it reminds me a lot of some of
my high-end concealers but honestly it's
kind of better than some of my high in
Casillas because it covers extremely
well and it's also not super drying
because something feels to be a little
bit dry a little bit - you know like
arrow it's hard to explain but this one
has a really nice hydrating factor to it
and under I love it
I blend out with this Real Techniques
sponge because this is my drugstore
sponge of choice and then for cream
contouring I don't always cream contour
by day what I could describe because
it's my role is dog from the drugstore
actually the beauty supply store
beautify store every Beauty on
international in the 80s you proq with
this is the Ruby - 3 phase trader is low
14 and our nails put me onto this
product I know she'll kill me why did
not give her the cred but this is
amazing it comes with two shades so I
can mix the two and then a bunch of
shades to choose from and I just apply
it to my cheek and the reason I like
this one is okay
so you want to turn to the side see how
it's not shiny I don't like my cream
cons going to be too shiny and just too
oily and slippery it's a girl
it just I don't like that I just don't
really prefer blending that it's too
much of a hassle of getting everywhere
so it's so slippery but this one isn't
it's a semi matte finish so it just
looks really really good for clean
because it's not too loud on my face
that make sense at all
I'm gonna take this morphe brush that
came into a rose gold collection I have
and just consult it in now I'm gonna
work on setting the face and this is my
Maybelline shine free powder that I talk
about all the freaking time I don't know
if you're going to talk about this
powder a lot like it's really really
really really so amazing I'm taking the
shade light for under my eyes it reminds
me a lot of the lower Messier powder
learn more powder I'm gonna go ahead and
take this huge Real Techniques sponge my
first time trying this one but I love
the tiny one
so like I'm go ahead throw this in so I
want to try it I'm gonna pack this
powder onto my face then they take the
Maybelline fit me powder this is number
355 coconut and this is my favorite
drugstore powder in terms of what I'm
doing right now because you guys always
seem like me
you guys always see me use my Sephora
microcement powder and I'm basically
doing the same thing that I do with my
microphone powder but with this powder
it is it this is what your up ster
option and now that this is all on my
face sometimes I do like to take a spray
just to kind of you know tone down the
mattifying look of the makeup because I
just did a lot of powdering and I do not
want to look super powdery I want looks
nice and flawless
so I'm going to take the pixie glow miss
this one looks like I'm so spray all of
my face go ahead let that settle into my
skin and I'm going to move on now for
brows if there was one product or this
any products that I would have to use
those an affordable slash drugstore
product for the brow it would definitely
be be BH Cosmetics Studio Pro brow
pomade and these remind me a lot of the
UH Nastasia dip brow but to leave these
ones don't dry out s-class just some
personal experience and I like the shade
Auburn a lot because not too intense but
it gets the job done
see it looks nice in 3d and then to
clean on my brow as well as apply my eye
I'm going to take the NYX eyeshadow base
and this is number three the reason why
I like it is because it's in my skin
tone shade it's not super white and I
don't really like super white primer so
like I'm doing the crazy look because
sometimes it can be a little bit too
intense so this one it gives me a nice
bright base about being too great so
it's good and then for eyeshadow if I
had to choose like one palette or one
shadow whatever that was affordable that
I know love forever and ever and ever
and ever it will definitely be morphe
35o and the reason why is because I mean
it's just it screams me because of all
the colors all nice and warm and create
mini looks with it so I was create
something really nice and simple next or
this looks going to the other eye
emember mascara my favorite mascara this
drugstore is the Maybelline lash
sensational mascara always Asian
jason'll now go ahead and add a wing
because if you want to excuse my
favorite drugstore winged liner product
and this is a Physicians Formula
i boosted two-in-one lash boosting
eyeliner WebSphere that's long name and
then for lashes these are my all-time
favorite drugstore laches I put a lot of
onto these they're amazing these the
salon perfect number 6:15 and you can
see only have one more left but I have
like hiccup acts I'm night and sweating
it but these are amazing I should cut
off one little here as you can see it's
kind of like a little section but to
calm one section and if it's perfectly
on my eye and basis yes they open them
up a lot while that's drying I'm going
to go ahead and bronze up our skin and
this is the Black Radiance true
complexion contour palette and I just
really like this palette a lot because
like to mix the contour and sculpt
shades it gives me a really nice warmth
to my skin and I really appreciate that
because I looking nice and healthy and
warm and you know that did this so this
is definitely my favorite and in a
forest blush this is an old-time
favorite it's the NYX HD blush in the
shade double dare and I like double
there specifically because it's nice and
orange is extremely pigmented
I just want to happen at one time and
even that is a lot not just really reach
out to excess otherwise they'll be
insane but that's why I like it because
it's amazing it's very pigmented be
careful and it will highlight my
favorite affordable highlighter to date
as of now and planning forever - I got
two of them so I'm like okay I have
enough to last me this is the Wet n Wild
mega
highlighter and this is precious petal
and I love this because sometimes with
certain highlighters I have to put base
in order to get that pop but this one is
literally so smooth and buttery that you
do not need anything it's just pure
highlight so I really like it
see that no base and it already goes up
that nice Lane
so I really like this highlight and then
for lipsticks I was going to choose lick
lipstick but I decided to go ahead and
choose this lipstick instead because it
reminds me of a liquid lipstick but it's
not a liquid lipstick it's so hard to
explain but this is the NYX full
throttle lipstick and it goes on here
look here just watch watch this magic it
goes on kind of like liquidy you know
okay what's happening if you're
pigmented and they drive down in today's
clip so it's a trip man it's true just
do it I'm gonna go ahead and do my hair
and all that good stuff that we had back
so here you have the finished look and
I'm the honestly this was a meant to be
like a book or tutorial I simply just
want to show my favorite drugstore
portable products in action because to
me that just makes the most sense so you
guys I mean like how the video turned
out is the look turn out if you did be
sure to give a thumbs up if you guys
want to see me do a high-end version of
this kind of video to let me know and I
will do it for other best then you guys
so much for watching and I'll see you
guys in my next step blue</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
