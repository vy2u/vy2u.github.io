the rebirth of mister me on Monday and
what I did was well I got these L'Oreal
colorist does situations and misses
always carbonate situation these are

thought it was really cool if I put them
on a little bag and I pick one out and I
use on my hair and I created a makeup
look around that color I that might be
really fun so that is what we're doing
today it's still mystery factor there's
no wheel I don't have that wheel anymore

to keep its box it's cute
I'm nervous because look I get a color
that's like mmm come on to spray my hair

the browser but I want to just get them
done the base done first and now I'm
gonna go ahead and do the eye shadow for

colors ice cream palette I think and I'm
gonna take the shake cone because it

color
and then taking the new morphe dared to
create this is the winery's did a video

Mac make some medium eyeliner gonna put
some on the back of my hand okay yeah I
take this little concealer brush first

be neat by any means I kind of wanted to
travel a lot into the whole the whole
eye basically is what we're trying to
aim for go ahead take sequin and pop it
on can use that little brush to get to
the inner corner of it I'm gonna go back
into the dose of colors palette and just
soften out that glitter go around a bit
