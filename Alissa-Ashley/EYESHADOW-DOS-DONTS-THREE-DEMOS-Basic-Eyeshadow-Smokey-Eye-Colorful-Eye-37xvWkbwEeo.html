hey you guys elect to my channel today's
video is going to be an eyeshadow do's
and don'ts video and I'm really excited
to films for you guys because you guys
love my hooded eyes didn't don't and my
highlight contour do's and don'ts so now
I'm gonna do I shall do the don'ts and I
have a lot of these notes planned but I
feel like I shadow is something that
everyone wants to know okay like what I
do what are not do it I just felt like
it'll be great to put this up right now
and yes my eye is watering right now my
nails I've two nails broken off whatever
my eyes water right now because all that
I just put it through but I hope that
you guys enjoyed the video I decided to
make this a three part video one eye is
going to be the basic you know like
standard eye shadow look these second
ones going to be a colorful look and the
third one is going to be a black smokey
eye I just felt like these eye shadow
looks tend to be the most requested of
me to teach and also people want to do
them so I decided to do three and size
to three because I just really want to
switch out of it because there's so many
eyeshadows and dogs videos already on
here to locate let me up something new
so hope you guys enjoy it I would not
talk any more because it may be a little
bit long but if you do enjoy it please
make sure to subscribe and thank you so
much for watching and I will see you
guys soon and yeah that's my intro let's
get to the video okay so my first do is
all dependent on whether or not you do
your face makeup first but since I do I
always make sure to apply powder to
catch the fall out because you do not
want that now the second do it's really
important is to prime your eye I like to
prime mine with concealer and powder
that's just a preference because it
works out for me but whatever you do
just make sure you prime it because it's
super duper important if you neglect
priming your eye it will be completely
patchy and I have oily lids so the
eyeshadow would just be a disaster
whether or not you have oily or dry lips
is just super important to prime for
another do you want to make sure to
apply your transition shade first before
moving into your darker shades this will
just create a nice soft transition and
it will not look crazy and another do is
you switch to a smaller
more condensed brush when applying
darker shades just for more control and
for more precision so that you don't end
up with raccoon eyes so you ever
creating a nice basic eye shadow looks
I'm just telling you guys the steps to
create this a don't is to neglect adding
a base for your pigment and also using a
fluffy brush for your pigments because
it will get everywhere and it will be a
disaster you want to make sure to apply
a base I love mac mixing medium liner
and as you can see the pigment is going
on smooth it will not transfer and it
also is more pigmented now we're going
to speed this wing because I do have a
winged liner video coming soon and the
focus isn't the wing but I'm creating a
wing to show you guys that after you're
done creating your wing it is pretty
important to set it in place with a
black eye shadow this will just help it
stay in place and not transfer on to
your waterline because if you don't do
this this is what will happen and this
is happened to me a lot I didn't know I
was doing it is just not very attractive
the next do is pretty obvious but you
just want to make sure to angle yourself
and lift your eye when applying your
mascara to avoid getting mascara all of
your work I've done this plenty of times
before as you can see if you just stay
at a flat angle you are just more likely
to ruin your work with mascara and you
don't want that
the next don't is to apply your liner
too low because when you try to smoke it
out it will end up being too low you
never want to apply the liner to where
you want the line to end if that makes
any sense at all you want to apply a
little bit above where you plan on
smoking it out so that when you do smoke
it out you get your desired smokiness
and not raccoon eyes now I'll go ahead
and quickly apply the pigment on the
inner corner again using my Mac makes a
medium liner just so can stay in place
and the next do is just to make sure to
set that liner in place whether or not
using a waterproof liner or anything you
still want to make sure to set it in
place just for extra assurance
now here are the two finish eyes as you
can see on the don't side there's a lot
of shimmer underneath the eye where it's
not supposed to be because of all the
pigment fall out so yeah just follow my
steps and your eye shadow game will
improve now so on to these second eye
for this colorful eye I will not be
going extremely in-depth however I want
to give you guys a few tips but I do
plan doing a colorful look soon which is
why the first do is to apply your middle
shuttle first this is just a preference
thing but I feel like the middle shadow
acts as a guide for your other shadows
you do not want to start without a base
especially when using brighter shadows
and you also don't want to start with
the deepest shade as you can see by not
starting out the base it looks a little
bit chalky especially in person and also
you want to make sure to clean your
brushes in between shades because by not
doing so you just won't get a smooth
transition and my blend game strong so
it's hard for it to look bad but trust
me it looks bad and by starting with
that blue shade it carried on to the
whole ombre and it created almost like a
little line underneath all that shadow
for you do you just want to take your
time and I like to use a small fluffier
brush with a very light hand and
gradually create my ombre just going
step by step I took some blue and I'm
going to take some green just to kind of
go on top and I lost a little bit of
intensity so I wanted that back and then
I'm going to switch to a clean shader
brush to apply my inner corner color for
more precision as well as more I want to
be more bright because I can't get that
effect with a fluffy brush and now here
are both of the eyes as you can see the
do side just looks much more neat and
soft even though the colors are so
bright it just looks much better now as
well into the last eye which is a smoky
eye I have a smokey eye tutorial on my
channel and it's much more bold and it
will be linked below but I want to do
this because use some of the steps that
I took personally when teaching myself
how to do a smoky eye it's all
preference thing but I hope you guys
take something from it the first thing
you want to do is begin with a
transition shade preferably a light
brown
this is crucial and creating a smoky eye
you never want to start with the black
first you never want to do that and then
it's also important to have a blank
fluffy brush on hand just to use between
eyeshadows just to soften up and as
you're building your colors it's
important to go back in with that fluffy
brush just to make sure everything is
nice and soft you don't want to use a
brush that is too big and you don't want
to start with the cream base
I feel like starting with the cream base
since it does dry down just makes
applying shadows on top of it's so hard
as you can see I'm trying it is an
absolute fail now you do want to use a
smaller brush when applying your cream
base and I also find that synthetic hair
brushes work feat best now I slowed it
down a bit because I want you guys to
see that as I get to the outer corner
I'm pushing the brush inwards you do not
want to continue to drag it out you want
to have nice control over that black so
pushing it inwards helps it also helps
to lift your eye to make blending easier
especially if you have hooded or droopy
lids because yeah sometimes that kills
our vibe and next I'm going to take a
brown eyeshadow to soften the edges of
the black face I'm not gonna take a
black first and take a brown first I
feel like you can just build up into
that intensity as opposed to having to
take it away and now I'm going to set
the black base with a black eyeshadow
this important not only does it make it
more opaque and intense but it also sets
it in place so it does not move around
throughout the day and I'm going to take
my blank fluffy flush and soften
everything out and now for the waterline
I'm going to apply a gel liner pencil I
prefer gel because it's more
long-lasting and it blends pretty easily
as long as you work fast I'm also going
to take a small brush just to make sure
I have more precision and more control
over where that color is going and I'm
going to use the brown eyeshadow just
smoking out and then following the brown
I'm going to use the black I always like
to use the brown first and then the
black on top just to make sure I'm
getting a nice soft smokey eye and
nothing too intense and then
lastly I'm going to connect the water
line to the outer lid so that there are
no gaps because that does not look the
best sometimes and now what you don't
want to do is apply the black liner to
low because it'll get a raccoon effect
and then she's gonna look really really
crazy and you also do not want to forget
to set it because if you forget to set
it and it's going to look very patchy
and just not as smooth as when you set
it and here is the dua and as you can
see it looks much more flattering and
now we are done so that is it for this
video I really really hope you guys
