for today's video I'm gonna show you
guys how to achieve this really nice
sultry eye makeup look for hooded eyes I
give you guys some tips and tricks like
I always do to pull off this eye look
because if you have hooded eyes you guys
know that sometimes eyelids could be
challenging so I'll show you guys how to
get this look this video is sponsored by
NYX professional makeup I'll be using
some of their products that are part of
the love you so muchi collection and the
love you so muchi collection has two
eyeshadow palettes and the formula of
the eyeshadows are so freaking cool
they're like spongy it's SuperDuper cool
they have to highlight palettes and then
they have the really cool really
interesting powder puff lippies that
i'll be swatching all for you guys later
on in the video
and with these lippies it's just the
most interesting formula ever because
they're not a liquid lipstick they're
not just a lipstick they feel so airy on
the lips I'm wearing one now and I don't
know it's just the most interesting lip
product I've tried so far like it's like
a powder but a cream at the same time
it's really interesting and you guys to
see all the colors later on in the video
because I show you guys how this I look
Paris with every single one so if you
guys want to see that then just keep on
watching and I hope you guys enjoy it
okay so as you guys can see I already
have one eye done the first thing that
I'm going to do is prime my eye gonna
take a little bit of eye primer and just
apply it to my whole eye next I'm gonna
go ahead and take a fluffy brush and a
light tan shadow and I'm going to use
this as my transition shade
with this shadow I'm actually going to
wing it out a bit because I feel like
this adds to the soul tree effect I'm
gonna take a shade deeper not too deep
and I'm gonna apply this right on top or
doing this to add some dimension because
if I just do one flat shadow and then
move on to this shimmer and then move on
to this the eye look is just gonna look
not so complete it's also gonna look
flat so you want to add some dimension
when doing a look like this and then for
our last match shadow for the top part
we're going to take a shade even deeper
but again not too deep we do not want
this to be SuperDuper deep or just
creating some nice I guess floette
Shrieve I don't know I described it but
this parts gonna be the focus but we
still want this part to have some
attention too so we're just kind of
building up the intensity in the crease
area without making it too intense and
then I'm gonna go ahead and use my
finger to con just fluff this up because
I have that a little bit too much if you
ever do that just use your finger to
lightly kind of blend it now for our
lovely shimmer I'm gonna take the love
you so muchi palette and we're gonna use
two shimmers in this palette and now I'm
going to take the nyx multitasker mixing
medium if you have hooded eyes a mixing
medium is crucial because otherwise
you'll get a lot of transferring and you
do not want that let's go ahead and open
it up I got a YouTube ami putting a
little bit on the back of my hand I'm
gonna take a flat brush just grab some
of that mixing medium and before I do
this one go ahead and show you guys the
colors we're gonna use today from the
palette I'm going to take this shade
right here first and then this shape to
go on top to add some dimension I want
to show you guys this first because once
I put this on my eye I do not want to
look up otherwise it will get all over
the place so that's one thing I do want
to give you guys like as guidance
because I know sometimes people they see
the products I use and they go and they
use them I okay like why is it not
working the way ELISA showed me so this
is telling you do not open your eyes if
you put this mixing medium on the eye
until you put your product and let it
dry down so
I'm gonna do now you also want to make
sure to put a very thin layer because if
it's too thick and will crack and then
since the mochi eyeshadow is so soft I'm
actually gonna apply with my finger and
then taking my finger again I took a
little bit more mixed-media I'm gonna
tap on to the eye and I'm going to apply
our other shade which has a little more
sparkle to it for my next step I'm I go
ahead and create a winged liner I did a
really medium-sized wing I would call it
it's not too big not too small it's also
kind of flowing in a more curvy fashion
versus like straight and the reason I
chose that sort of curve is because it
goes really nice in my eyes shut up if
my eye shadows kind of winged out as
well so I really want that kind of curvy
wing and set up a straight wing because
it's just gonna flow really nicely with
this eye look next I'm gonna go ahead
and apply some lashes or I definitely
prefer a lash more fluff and volume
because it just kind of pulls it
together I feel like at the lashes are
almost too thin it may look just not as
like sultry and also with any lash they
do happen to put on I highly recommend
cutting it because as you guys can see
my lash is more so focused on the outer
part that I would just really
emphasizing that outer part of the eye
and that's kind of what I want I want to
be very like outer eye focus outer
corner focused so with any lash with
this look
I would definitely cut it so that it's
more focus on that apart I
now for the bottom part of the eye I'm
going to apply a little bit more eye
primer and I'm going to go ahead and
apply a black eyeshadow and as you can
see in this eye it has some sparkles so
I actually took this shade in the love
you so muchi palette and I'm gonna take
some mixing medium put on top of here
and then put that shadow on so here is
the finished eye look really nice and
sultry and this eye look can actually
pair well with a lot of lip shades so to
demonstrate that I'm going to show you
guys how it looks with each of the new
NYX professional makeup powder puffs
lippies just so you guys the whole
effect
okay so here you guys have the finished
look and as you guys can see I do not
add highlight to where I know I'm Li
highlight I only did my nose and my keep
it slow only because I really want the
focus to be the eyes and that's why I
decided to go with a more toned down lip
of the powderpuff lippies so yeah here
you guys have the finished look I hope
you guys found this video to be helpful
if you did make sure to give it a big
thumbs up and I will see you guys in my
next video peace out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
