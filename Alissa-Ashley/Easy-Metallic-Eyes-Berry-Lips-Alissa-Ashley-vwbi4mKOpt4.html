today's video is going to be a makeup
tutorial on this look that you see right
here I created a nice metallic e purple
eye and I paired with a nice mattify lip
and the reason why I chose to do a
metallic eye is because my talents are
trending right now it's four and so four
is actually sponsoring this video isn't
it awesome you guys that's freakin
awesome you guys know I love Sephora but
it is trending right now at Sephora
metallic eyes metallic lip so I decided
to do a metallic eye and I just love how
it turned out I'm so here for Purple's I
love Purple's so if you guys are here
purple as well and if you guys want to
see how to create this nice metallic
look then just keep on watching and I
hope you guys enjoy it okay so starting
with the eyes first I'm taking the Urban
Decay primer potion in this is a shade
the original and I'm gonna go ahead and
just pack this on to my lid increase
area just basically all over my eye just
to really smooth it out and then for my
base I'm going to go ahead and take this
soft brown dip brow Nastasia and I'm
just taking a cream base because I find
that whenever I'm working with any sort
of color like purple it's really
important to have a base because
otherwise my shell just does not come
out the way I why and I know this
because I tried this like about three
different times without a base and as
you can see now I'm just packing on my
purple eyeshadow and for the crease area
I didn't want it to be too fancy but at
the same time I did not want to leave it
blank
because I did not put any shadow on the
lower part of my eye so I wanted all the
intensity to go to the top part so yeah
next for the star of the show I'm taking
the touch insole medalist liquid foil
and glitter shadow duo and this is
amazing and what you do first is you
take the liquid side and it's going to
be
base for your glitter and it does have
an applicator on the actual product but
I like to use a brush just so that I can
really get into my little hoodie because
it's so tiny and I'm just go ahead and
evenly apply it and a while it's still a
little bit wet I'm taking the glitter
part and it creates this really gorgeous
metal metallic look and if you do not
want to do a two-step you can also use
the Kat Von D metal crush eyeshadows
because those also give a nice metallic
look to the eyes as well and these are
basically the eyes done for now and
we're gonna move into the face next the
first thing we do is go ahead and remove
all that glitter fallout with a makeup
wipe and because I'm essentially
removing my moisturiser I'm taking the
it cosmetics bye bye under-eye cream
just to remoisturize that under-eye area
look at my hand just to remove eyes the
under eye area so it's nice and ready
for all my makeup because otherwise
it'll be all dry now I go ahead and move
on to foundation I'm taking the
Anastacio stick foundation and I mixing
the shades amber and cool golden to
getting my perfect shade Sims that go
ahead and blend that in and the next I'm
taking my NARS radiant creamy concealer
a cult favorite of mine and I'm just
like go ahead and use this to highlight
and conceal you guys already know the
drill and I'm also using this to sharpen
out the outer part of my eye shadow
because that's a look that I want to go
for it for today and then go ahead and
just set everything in place using my
Laura Mercier loose powder you guys
already know this because I use the same
products all the time because they're
just amazing and I'm gonna go ahead and
take my Sephora micro smooth powder you
guys know that I am just in love with
this powder because it's just so
beautiful and while we're talking about
Sephora they also have an app and I'm
sure you guys knew that but inside the
app they have something called a virtual
artist where they offer step-by-step
tutorials helping you achieve makeup
looks and just guiding you along
step-by-step and you can see everything
be applied to your face so it's pretty
cool and I'm just go ahead and scoped
out my cheekbones with my Kat Von D
shade + light and you guys normally
we use my NARS contour blush but I want
to go with the more cool tone contour
because of how cool toned this look is
so I kind of like everything to be very
harmonious so I wanted something very
cool toned for today and now moving back
into the eyes I want them to have more
of a pop so I'm taking the Kat Von D
metal crush eyeshadow and this in the
shade thunderstruck and I'm just adding
some metal or metal vibes to the eye
look and I really like to brighten my
little flappy fold area you guys already
know this because yeah my flappy folds
and you love to imma go ahead and add
some blush to my cheeks I decided to go
with a nice rosy pink blush just to add
a little bit of warmth without being too
overwhelming now I'm gonna go ahead and
do my highlight fizzle and this is my
little technique that I use when I first
apply the cover FX custom enhancer drops
and then my powder highlight right on
top and just I get my ultimate glow and
I'm supplying that to my highlighting
areas my nose my Cupid's bow and all
that good stuff and then last time I go
ahead and apply my lip color I know that
in one of my recent tutorials I did a
nice plum e purple lip and it's obvious
that I just like plenty purples and I
also like kind of adding a pout in the
center when I do some of these colors
because it just makes it look so pretty
in just a lil buddy and yet this is the
finished look so here is the finished
look close all that although that here's
the finished look I hope you guys like
how it turned out and if you did give a
thumbs up you know you want some of this
video
you know you do and if you happen to
recreate the look be sure to tag me on
instagram you know the deal
and if you happen to just create a
metallic look because it's trending
right now and go ahead and tag me that
too I like seeing work but other than
that hope you guys enjoyed it again if
you want to see anything else let me
know in the comments section down below
