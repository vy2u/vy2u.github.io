today I'm gonna show you guys how to get
this really nice look for the holidays
using the flirt cosmetics major
metallics palette to achieve this look
popped off of the red lips if you guys
want to see how I got this look then
just keep on watching as you can see I
have one eye done and the first thing
I'm gonna do is apply a brown base I
like to do this whenever I'm gonna do
certain eyeshadow looks because it just
enhances the eyeshadow if that makes any
sense so I'm just applying a really
light layer nothing too extreme because
I'm not going smoky I'm just going a
little bit subtle and then I'm gonna
apply a nice kind of orange shade on top
of that just to be my transition color
so I'm just sweeping this across my lid
and just dispersing it evenly and then
I'm also gonna go underneath the eyes
and I'm gonna apply this underneath the
eyes like I said and I'm not gonna do
anything too extreme just very nice and
subtle now for the star of the show like
I mentioned the beginning I'm gonna take
the major metallics eyeshadow palette
and here are some swatches for you guys
these eyeshadows are extremely buttery
they're so creamy and they're very
pigmented this will one little sweep so
I'm gonna go ahead and take that bronzer
shade on the top right of the palette
you guys know I love bronze shadows like
no I'm not gonna do any other colors I
like bronze especially for holiday and
I'm gonna apply that to the lid I like
this shade a lot and I also like the
quality of these eyeshadows they remind
me a lot of kind of like not necessarily
a cushion but they're very soft and when
you press down them you can just feel
they're really nice and hydrating which
I like and they apply really nicely and
I'm so sorry I'm like talking about the
eyeshadows but you guys can see which
colors I'm pointing to to create this
gradient on my eye because I want to
have a nice greedy and I want to add in
another color so we did burgundy and I'm
gonna take a nice maroon shade and I'm
just gonna pack that on the corner of my
eyes just to make those parts pop off it
and then I'm gonna go ahead and top on a
winged liner always say I'm just gonna
like do it and you guys are going seem
so easy but that's cuz I'm good and you
can be too if you watch my videos next
I'm gonna go ahead and apply some mask
and I'm just gonna apply a thin later
because I will be putting on lashes
later and then I go back into the
palette and take that nice champagne
nice shimmery shade and I'm gonna pop
that in my flappy fold which some people
hate it when I call a flabby fold but
that's my term it's cool that's we call
it over here in illicit town why am I
saying all this let me shut up and apply
this beautiful eyeshadow and I'm gonna
go ahead and pop on my bottom lash
mascara and then I'm gonna put on my
lashes because they are a necessity to
me and they just make my eyes look nice
and buttery
especially for a look like this
especially when I have winged liner
because when I have wings it can
overpower my eye so I want to add
balance by adding a lash now to go ahead
and contour this face I will little Dion
contour not gonna lie to you we have our
days where you put a little bit too much
on but I mean it still worked out and I
buffed it out with a brush and my
bronzing powder to soften it up it was
still very very very contoured but still
I'm gonna go ahead and add some blush a
really nice soft layer of blush because
okay listen you can't have OD contour
and OD blush
you gotta balance it out and then I'm
gonna use that champagne shade to
highlight my nose and my Cupid's bow and
it looked really nice and like I
mentioned earlier the shadows are really
creamy so it worked out perfectly it
wasn't too powdery think that now for
lips I'm gonna line them with a brown
liquid lipstick because that's just my
liner of choice not an actual liner and
I'm gonna mix that in with this
beautiful red you guys already know what
red it is it's the Finn T Beauty stun
Olympe and I'm just going to mix that in
and it created a really gorgeous holiday
red
to finish off the look I'm gonna add a
little bit of highlight because I don't
want to be blinding I'm using a pinky
tone highlight because it looks more
subtle on my skin but still very
gorgeous and then I'm going to spray my
face and set it in place I'm gonna bathe
this why call I call it shower time
because I spray so much but after my
shower we have the finished look hope
you guys like how this look turned out
if you happen to recreate it because
it's very simple be sure to tag me I
would love to see it because it makes me
very happy that you guys are enjoying my
videos enough to recreate my looks and
do my recommendations and all that stuff
I can't talk but other than that thank
you guys so much for watching and I'll
see you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
