is going to be on this makeup look that
you see right here and I decided to do
something that was very everyday
wearable kind of fall kind of baddie
vibes going on I don't know why I'm
going to title this but it's just very
simple glam but what's most exciting to
me about the look is that it is under
$100 I decided to create a little budget
for myself and stay under $100 because I
know that sometimes my looks are quite
expensive my looks are quite expensive I
calculated I'm just like wow Alyssa how
you even like sweating all this it's all
your face so I decided to stay under 100
bucks for people out there who just kind
of want to pleasure themselves and you
know like you know so you know so that's
why I decided to do so if you guys want
to see how I achieve this look then just
keep on watching and I hope you guys
enjoy okay so first I'm gonna start out
by priming I'm taking the Black Radiance
true complexion shine control primer and
honestly priming is kind of optional
some days I don't sometimes I do but for
the sake of including an affordable
primer that I like I'm using this one it
really mattifies where you put it put my
forehead I'm mainly on my nose for
foundation I'm taking the new la girl
foundation this is the pro coverage HD
long-wear illuminating foundation and
it's in the shade bronze now go ahead
and pump a few pumps of that onto my
morphe e6 go ahead just buff that into
my skin
now we'll go ahead in highlight and
contour it when it comes to trying to
budget myself I try to find products
that have either a duo or trio which
I'll use earlier for this is a duo and
this is the NYX sculpting highlight duo
so it has a highlight and contour in one
so go ahead and use the highlight side
to highlight and conceal oops
I'm running low go ahead and blend that
out
and then go ahead and use the opposite
in to add some color to my face and
contour
i'ma go ahead and send my highlighted
areas in place with my maybelline shine
free loose powder in the shade medium
you
I'm also mused that power to set the
rest of my face as well
now I'm moving away from the face and
step into the eyes well click them take
this Studio Pro once it go through
Studio Pro waterproof brow pomade by BH
Cosmetics and this is a shade Auburn and
it's the bomb
and then to clean them up I'm gonna go
ahead and take that highlight contour
duo now go ahead and scrape on the back
of my hand and just use this as my
under-eye not under i under brow my
thing okay basically I'm just really
trying to make sure that I'm using the
products that I have for multiple
purposes as opposed to switch to a
different concealer that's what I'm
trying to say but couldn't say it
whatever okay let me just do this
I'm also going to take this all the way
down and use my eye base
I'm going to set my base in place one
Abel enshrine free powder for the item
take this Revlon Colorstay not just
nudes I'm taking this shade right here
just this one right here and place this
all in my crease area
and I'm gonna take the Maybelline Color
tattoo and bat to the bronze and go
ahead and place it on my lid
then we'll go ahead and create a pretty
decent-sized wing with the Physicians
Formula I booster and it kind of reminds
me of the Kat Von D trooper alignment
always used so I'm going to liking it
doing back into my Revlon palette I'm
gonna go ahead and just place the brown
that I used on the top right on the
bottom
I'm go ahead and apply coat of mascara
to the top and bottom lashes using the
Maybelline lash lash sensational mascara
and if your lashes I'm going to go ahead
and take the ardell demi wispies they do
have the singular packs I'm gonna go
ahead and list that price because
obviously not everyone's gonna buy a
whole frickin thing of lashes and I
think they revamped these because I
don't know they're more wispy so I'm
really feeling them so I'll go ahead and
apply that to my lash and to finish off
the face I'm go ahead and take this
Rimmel London what's the actual name for
it it's called golden bronze it's their
highlight sculpting kit thingy I'll go
ahead and use the contour shade first
this is a morphe 4 brush looks pretty
pigmented so I'll go ahead and be
careful with it mmm hi this shade this
is really beautiful like it's really
rare for me to find a really nice
contour bronze like the perfect mixture
of cool tone a warm tone and Holy Hill
isn't like beautiful I'm being too
excited
I'm go ahead and take that same blush in
that little kit as well
let me go ahead and take the highlight
in that little kid as well
this time definitely more than Natural
Science you got to build it like pack it
on a little bit and it's some morphe why
14 they just came out with this
collection you use my code if you want
to save some coin
let me go ahead and just highlight my
flappy fold using the light shimmery
pink shade in the Revlon palette
and if a likkle I think it's clear that
I could not figure out what lip color by
decide to go with Lena lashes liquid
lipstick in the shade
just because it goes to the kind of like
Colton look
so here's the finished look and yeah I'm
pretty priests label pretty subtle slate
but it's still working so if you happen
to recreate it be sure to tag me and if
you liked it be sure to give a thumbs up
I always get so excited at in the videos
I'm just like I like this look like you
better like you just filmed it but I am
I like it I like it a lot I want to take
some pictures be basic so if you guys
watch and you wanted to see anything
that's a little bit more dramatic are
just more um whatever the word is if you
want to see something just more more but
still budget it under $100 let me know
and I will do it but other than that
thank you so much for watching let me
get out of here cuz I'm being so goofy
right now and yeah I'll see you guys
soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
