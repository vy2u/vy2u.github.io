first things first I have missed you
guys I have not uploaded in two weeks
and you guys know that I try to upload
as much as I can however I was very very
sick you follow me on Instagram and
snapchat you know that yeah it's been a
friggin struggle I believe that I had a
sinus infection of some sort at a cold
had a sore throat pinkeye it's just been
absolutely horrible it's just yeah it
hasn't been a fun vacation ah to say the
least but I am so glad you feeling for
you guys again and I'm just yeah
happen again the flow of filming also
I'm sure you guys know something
different I did cut off all of my hair
if you follow me on my other meetings
you know that because I was posting a
lot of selfies cuz I'm just you know
really trying to get used to it
a lot of you got to ask me you know why
I cut my hair on my Instagram and
honestly I just I don't really have an
attachment to my hair per se I don't
really feel like it's needed to keep it
I guess you can say I don't know it's a
weird thing like I just I feel good with
it and without it so I just got bored
now it's okay I'm just gonna shave it
off and it's gonna grow back you know
like that's the way I see it I haven't
seen like that for about six years now
since I was 15 years old I did my first
bus cut so I yeah that is why you know
there's no deeper meaning to it I just
felt like that's what I want to do and
I'm happy I did because getting hot and
it's gonna be so easy for me and I'm
lazy so it works out perfectly but I
don't want to talk too much this look
today is gonna be a very nice kind of
warmish brownish whatever you want to
call it type of look so yeah that's all
I don't want to talk too much
because I don't know how long the
tutorial is going to be but make sure to
comment down below what you guys like to
see next also if you are going to prom
this year comment down your dress color
because I'm gonna do a lot of prom
tutorials for this month and next month
and I want to make sure it gets much
colors as possible other than that thank
you so much for being here and I hope
you guys enjoy the tutorial
alright so the first thing I do is just
take my skin and havea primer spray and
like I mentioned on snapchat if you
follow me I do love this primer a lot
I feel like it's just so hydrating and
just easier than actually applying an
actual primer and it actually lasts
longer than some of my other primers I
own so yeah I like it now I'm going to
take this Tarte water foundation and
this is very new to me I know it looks a
little bit orange but they don't really
have an extremely wide shade selection
yet but I do like the formula and the
coverage is amazing so I've been really
loving this foundation I'll kind of you
know put that in a favorites video and
kind of explain more about it when I can
now I'm going to take my Ruby kisses 3d
face creator in level 15 by the way I
decide to add these little atoms just
kind of show you guys what I like about
the product and in some little add-ons
on the bottom I will say things I don't
like about products I use you guys will
see for example this one the back
concealer I do like it because it's full
coverage it's creamy but it's thick and
can be drying it took me a long time to
find a powder that didn't make me look a
crocodile with this concealer but other
than that I do love it I just want to be
honest about it and say that this
is thicker than a snicker so yes only
thing I don't like about it but a powder
that did work with it was the Maybelline
setting powder this powder I think was
like only five bucks at Walmart it I
really really freaking liked it like
this is like my second time using it I
was like oh okay because I tend to buy
things and I just kind of don't use it
but I actually like this a lot and now
I'm taking some banana powder just to
bake with and I kind of want you know
some yellow color in my skin because I
am yellow toned and I'm just going to
set the rest of my face with some more
Mercier powder
now on to the eyes I'm taking my Julius
place nubian palette and if you have the
morphe 35o you can also create this look
with that palette as well because i was
looking at both of them and they have a
lot of similarities but I like nubian
palette because it's called Nubian so I
decided to use that one and I only used
about three shades in the actual palette
this looks very very simple I feel like
this is probably one of my go-to
everyday looks I know you know it's like
glitter and whatnot but it's a really
pretty everyday look for me so yeah I'm
just going to take my Mac mixing medium
liner and pack all my shimmery pigment I
do not place any shimmer pigment on my
lid without my mixing medium liner and
I'm gonna pack on this glitter right on
top I do love this glare because it's
very very thin and tiny so it's not too
chunky and it lasts long throughout the
day without crackling off and now I'm
going to take these same shadows that I
use on top on the bottom I feel like
this is like my favorite way to do eye
shadow just take the same shadows and
place them on the bottom it's very very
basic eye shadow technique in my opinion
and it just looks very flattering I like
doing this it's like my favorite if you
haven't noticed now I'm going to take
some mascara
this one's from Maybelline it's their
newest one I really like it and I'm
going to take these Lillie lashes I
don't know the name at the top of my
tongue but I do love her lashes a lot
now to finish the rest of the face I'm
going to take the Too Faced dog
chocolate Soleil bronzer and this is
just balm you guys know I use this a lot
I use this in pretty much every single
video because it's so warm
it's the perfect tone for me and I'm
going to take makeup geeks summer fling
a blush I decided to go with something
more peachy because I feel like it's
more flattering with gold and bronze
tones that I have in my eyes and I just
love this blush and I'm going to be
highlighting with anastacio so Hollywood
illuminator I didn't get my other cheek
on Kara because I was out of focus but
you guys have seen me highlight plenty
times before today very basic and I'm
just
overdoing it as usual and then lastly
for the lips I took my Ruby kisses no
kiss New York roast a coffee why did I
make you a long time roasted coffee
lipliner and I took a dose of colors
cork I have been loving this combo you
guys love the combo you guys are x-men
Instagram here it is this is such a
beautiful shade to me and then I'm going
to just set my face in place with the
Scandinavia finishing spray and then
that will be my finished look I really
hope you guys like it I hope you guys
think it's awesome and please make sure
