welcome to my first video of the new
year I wanted to upload on the first but
I got sick so couldn't really do that
and I'm honestly still sick if you can
hear my voice a little bit which is why
this video is gonna be a voiceover
because if I have to sit here and talk
the whole time I film this I would just
be like so like just you know what
you're sickening is kind of like anywho
this is a fullface it's an everyday
makeup look and it is under $100 I gave
myself the budget up $100 and this is
what I got so if you guys want to see
that then just keep on watching and I do
hope you guys enjoy it and if you are
not subscribed already be sure to do
that because I'm pretty cool and yeah
I'm trying to get to my subscribers
we're not there yet worried get there
soon but let's go ahead and get into the
video and hope you guys enjoy it okay so
the first thing we do is pry my skin
using this elf beautifully bare luminous
matte primer I like this because it's a
nice balance between Matt and luminous
so it should say give me a really nice
balanced base and another option is the
black radiance true complexion shine
control primer if you are staying in the
100 dollar budget I love that one a lot
as well now for a foundation I decide to
use the NYX total control drop
foundation and I love this one a lot
because not only is it affordable but it
comes in a lot of shades and it's also
very buildable so I feel like this
foundation can cater so many different
people not just with the shades but also
with your preference so do you want a
lighter coverage or a more full coverage
it's just perfect
now for concealer my beloved color pop
no feel it's a concealer this is six
dollars and it's amazing but if you
cannot shop online for whatever reason
here are two other options for you that
are both great and within our budget and
to blend this out I'm taking this sponge
by elf it reminds me a lot of the Tarte
quickie blending sponge based on its
shape it's a little bit softer and this
comes in a pack so it comes with another
silicone sponge and it's $10 for both of
them but I preferred this one over that
one because I'm just a sponge kind of
gal I do not like silicone sponge isn't
it
and then to set my entire face in place
I'm going to take the makeup revolution
banana powder you guys see me use this
often for my under eye area as well as
my forehead but this can also work for
setting the entire face and I love this
powder if you are either lighter than me
or darker than me they do have two other
shade options available they have the
shades ghost terracotta and banana which
I'm using now and another option for a
banana powder is the elf Beauty shield
setting powder in the shade golden that
one is the bomb calm as well if you get
your hands on that now for eyebrows I'm
gonna take the NYX micro brow pencil and
I do want to find other brow products
that are affordable I feel like those
are the hardest to find but this is a
great pencil but if you guys have other
options let me know because I do want to
try that out just to expand and to be
able to offer more products for brows on
my channel because brows are definitely
a challenge but I'm gonna use this to
fill in my brows and then on top of that
I'm taking the elf cream eyeliner in the
shade coffee and this one is not for
brows but I do like it for the brows
because the way it dries down it really
really sets the brows in place so I like
that staying power about it a lot and it
adds a nice warmth to my brows as well
and then to clean up my brows I'm going
to use my color pop concealer if your
concealer has a nice applicator that is
nice and flexible like this one you can
use that to clean up your brows instead
of using a brush then you can blend it
down to act as a primer we're being very
resourceful by doing this because not
only is it quicker but I mean it's
resourceful and make sure to remove the
excess when you do this as I included
that clip to let you guys know don't
just dip and do it you want to remove a
lot of that product so you do not get a
thick sloppy line now for eyeshadow
eyeshadow is always an optional thing
for everyday I want to create this eye
look using the NYX lid lingerie and I
like this palette because it offers a
nice variety of different shades and
they're perfect for everyday wear for me
I like to do matte I look so I'm doing
everyday just because I find that at the
end of the day they look a little bit
better than if I do like a shimmer on
the lid it just looks a little bit nice
and cleaner and softer and it's just
for everyday and then we're gonna do a
wing using the elf intense h2o proof
eyeliner pin winged liner is optional
for everyday I think it really depends
on how much time you have but I
definitely recommend using a pen sort of
winged liner product instead of a cream
or like a liquid because you're less
likely to mess up especially if you're
on the go for like this nice little
everyday look for work it's just gonna
be much easier for you and then this
product is one of my favorites is the
elf active mascara and brow duo when it
comes to being on a budget
I feel like duo products are your best
friend because you get a product that
literally serves two purposes for your
makeup and I mean who doesn't love that
and I like this brow gel a lot and I
also like this mascara a lot so it's
just a win-win and this mascara is
waterproof so it will last throughout
the day and it will not smudge I've used
it plain times before it has never
failed me so I highly recommend this
product a lots of my favorites and now
for another duo we have the elf aqua
Beauty blush and bronzer duo this is in
the shape bronze peach and I'm gonna use
this to contour and blush and this is
one of my favorite products as well as
well as this brush because it's also
affordable but I just love this duo a
lot because it gives such a nice natural
finish and then I'm gonna go back into
the eye and we're just wrapping up the
eye by finishing off the bottom I will
apply mascara later I like to do that
last for the bottom part of the eye now
for highlighter I'm taking elf and Hart
defense so it's coffee and cream
highlighter and this is one of the best
drugstore highlighters we've ever used
it is so beautiful but it sold out so
another drugstore favorite is the wet
and wild of precious petals and this one
is only $4.99
so get your handle on that one if you
cannot and if you do not have your hands
on this one already cuz they're both
amazing I just I love this one I love it
a lot now for lips I'm taking my kiss
New York roasted coffee lip pencil that
I got from the beauty supply store and
I'm using this as a base for my lip
color because this will help it last
longer throughout the day and it's also
pretty and then for lipstick I'm taking
the NYX lip tease full color lip oil in
the shape beyond basic and I like this
because it's extremely comfortable on
the lips
and it'll be easy to touch up throughout
the day because it's not a liquid
lipstick because I'm sure we all know
sometimes liquid lipsticks are just a
pain in the butt
like I hate reapplying them whenever I'm
done eating my food I'm just like I
don't feel like doing this anyways now
I'm gonna go ahead and apply my bottom
lash mascara and then I want to add a
little bit more to the eyes I'm gonna
highlight my brow bone to give a more
like a weak look to my eyes and just
brighten and I'm also gonna apply some
to the inner corner of the eye and then
that'll be the final step to this
beautiful look and I'm gonna go ahead
and throw my sweater and be right with
you guys okay so here you have the
finished look I think that it looks
great and I think that yeah I mean it
looks pretty good I think that you can't
really tell that I was budgeting I mean
and that's like really the whole point
because I know that like no one ever
likes the budget or at least I don't
like to budget and I need to kind of
like bring myself back to like reality
in the sense that I need to be
understanding to the fact that not
everyone splurges on makeup the way I do
and a lot of my videos like include
really expensive makeup and of course
I'm still gonna like use that makeup
because some people do like to splurge
but others don't
others don't really have the ability to
splurge because they do have to budget I
want to be able to just offer you guys
really affordable products and products
that I stand by that I've used before
and I love and they work really well for
such an affordable price point I'm just
trying to help the best way I can I hope
you guys appreciate it and like it and
enjoy it and find it helpful cuz that's
the whole goal that's won't talk anymore
but I hope you guys like the video and
I'll see you guys in my next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
