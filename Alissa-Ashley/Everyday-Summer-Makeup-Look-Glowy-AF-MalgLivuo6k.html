I decide to film this really nice
everyday wearable glowy summer look and
I kind of want to do this because I
lately discover it the most amazing
glowing skin prawns ever so I really
wanted a reason to use it so I kind of
just want the flow and created this look
which I'm really feeling I think I feel
everything I feel everything that I put
up but I think that's the way it should
be but whatever I'm really doing this a
lot okay so I hope you guys like it as
well it's really simple but its label so
that's what counts
so if you guys want to see how I
achieved this look then just keep on
watching okay so the first step and I
think that everyone knows this you don't
know now you know is skincare you want
to make sure that your skin is nice and
prepped or just clean and all that good
stuff
let me just me doing what to do okay I'm
going to take my Tarte rein force of the
sea cleanser and I'm going to take my
baby play ultimate skin spa system go
into a couple pumps and I'm going to
exfoliate
okay so the reason why I exfoliating is
important is because you're gonna remove
all dead skin cells or just any look off
of your skin and you want to start with
a really nice clean base especially when
it comes to glow because I feel like
with Glo you're really really kind of
enhancing your pores so you want to make
sure to prep your skin so let me go
ahead and just wash this off not bad but
next time I go ahead and just add my
moisturizer and it's pretty empty but
I'm not to make it work a tiny little
get some more later
but this is my favorite because it's
really lightweight it's nothing too
thick but at the same time it's enough
to make my dry skin happy all day and
then we go ahead and just spray my face
with my skin to Navy eye makeup primer
and I'm doing a spray as opposed to a
cream because I feel like if I do a
cream it may end up looking too heavy so
I want to make it look as lightweight as
possible so I'm kind of just okay nozzle
it's all messed up so I'm kind of just
going lightweight with my moisturizer my
primer so that I won't mess up why I do
my foundation it'll mix it okay so now
let's move into foundation my foundation
of choice is the cover FX natural finish
oil-free foundation and I just feel like
this gives me a really really natural
finish and yeah I don't want to use
anything that's super liquidy or super
thick either and I feel like this kind
just meets in the middle because I'm
choosing this and I'm going to take my
cover FX custom in here for drops and
this is in the shade candle light and
you use two of the drops today but this
is going to be the one that I mix with
my foundation and it looks like this you
guys um
oh it's like liquid gold gold and I'm
just going to take about a drop let's
see I want you to see it about one okay
maybe two drops I'm gonna try not to OD
today and I'm going to mix it together
with my Beauty Blender and it's applied
to my face
now I'm gonna go ahead and just conceal
I'm not taking Too Faced Born This Way
concealers and I have been loving them
if you can't tell already because I've
been using them like every single
tutorial and I'm going to take the
shades tan and medium I like to mix them
because medium by itself is too light
and tan by itself it's just not it
doesn't satisfy me because I'd like to
be really highlighted so I'm gonna take
a little bit of tan first and normally
I'll mix them together like rock the bat
but I kind of just want to see how much
I need to highlight and I'm going to
explain why you don't want to be too
highlighted in just a second but let me
go ahead and win this out first okay so
I'm accident keep it like this for now
and I usually apply a little bit more
concealer but you gotta see it just a
second the next step is going to be to
apply my highlight if this was using on
snapchat that one time here's the
footage and I'm going to take the custom
enhancer drops and this is sunlight and
sunlight baby is nice it's okay don't
drop it it's really really beautiful I'm
going to take on the back of my hand
take about hmm I took about this much
not that much fun I'm going to use it
off but just in case I'm going to take
the edge of my Beauty Blender and dip it
into the sunlight and I'm just going to
place it on the area why normally
highlight and if you have too much on
the Beauty Blender just kind of dab it
on your wrist and then go back in with
blending it out
I'm going let me go ahead and do the
same thing to the other side
now I'm gonna go ahead and work on
setting my under eye I mean the first
make sure there's no creasing under
there and I went ahead and switched to a
different Beauty Blender because I don't
want to have shimmer I need my eyes that
is not only good go ahead and just blend
out any possible creasing I'm going to
quickly take my Laura Mercier powder and
just get right underneath the eye and
this is a morphe g35 brush as you can
see i avoided setting this highlight
because i don't want to get rid of it i
want to be really dominant in this look
so i do not want to put any powder on
that now let me go ahead and do the eye
and take your time with this because if
you don't your under eye will end up
looking patchy you want to be very soft
on a very lightweight hand and just get
that powder underneath there and then
just sweep away the excess gonna go
ahead and set my forehead and I'm going
to take my Maybelline shine free powder
and this in the shade medium and I'm
going to take this it cosmetics heavenly
look Swan Bob powder brush I'm taking
this because it's a little bit more on
the fluffy side so it's not gonna take
up that powder too much
now I'm going to take my Black Radiance
powder and this in the shade cafe I'm
going to take this morphe brush any
fluffy angled brush will do I'm going to
go ahead and chisel out my cheekbones
I'm kind of placing the product on for
now and then once I set that nut cream
but like liquid highlight then I can go
in and move a little bit more but I
can't right now otherwise I will end up
looks like a patchy mess so you will see
you and then they take the makeup Inc XL
XL blush just place that right on top
and then with the morphe g37 brush I'm
going to take the Ruby kisses all over
glow and this is light glow and just set
that liquid highlight in place
you
kind of quickly go ahead and nose
contour my morphe m-52 for brush and the
next thing you want to do is just go
ahead and fill in your brows I'm going
to first brush them upwards they already
are up now I'm going to take my studio
finish concealer and just outline the
shape that I'm going to create and I'm
going to take my NYX tainment frame brow
pomade I'm going to take this same brush
it's from makeup addiction it's an
angled brow brush and I'm just going to
fill in my brows now go ahead and just
set it in place with honest osseous
clear brow gel
now instead using my Urban Decay primer
potion because I love it but it's a
little bit more light and I feel
obligated to do a lot of shadow when I
use it I'm actually going to take my NYX
eyeshadow base and this is number three
and this is a skin tone one I'm gonna
just take my GBAS place smudger brush
and just place this on my lid I did
blend out my concealer I thought it was
filming but it wasn't so my pet I just
blended out my concealer and the eye I
was got placed this all over my lid and
I'm gonna take my Maybelline shine-free
powder and just set it in place now I go
ahead and just highlight my brow bone

flappy fold I called it like inner
corner like in the last two videos you

say okay bye then on a zoeva
two to four brush I'm going to take mega
Peaks creme you lay eyes shadow and I'm
also going to take a smidge of cocoa
bear I want to take too much because I'm
not trying to create an intense look I
want to get enough to really define my
crease area then we go ahead and apply
cocoa bear to the outer corner and then
I'm going to take this pigment by
janessa my rigs and it's called in light
if that's not a pigments or of
attraction which is more of a highlight
I'm going to take this Inglot brush to
apply my mixing medium liner and all
that good stuff and apply the pigment or
apply it to my eye
I'm also going to plunge in the inner
corner
and then to further break my eyes I'm
going to take the Sephora brow enhancer

my waterline now I'm going to go ahead
and just elongate the eye I'm going to
take these you a kitten liner for lashes
