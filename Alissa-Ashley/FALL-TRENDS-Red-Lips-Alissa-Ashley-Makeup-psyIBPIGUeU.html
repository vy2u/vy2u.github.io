today's look is going to be on the fall
trend of red lips however this isn't
your typical red lip and soft eye
tutorial this is just my take on it and
how I would walk a red lip so if you
want to see how I got this nice sultry
sexy look then just keep on watching I'm
going to start with the face for the
sake of my returning subscribers I don't
want to bore them too much so I'm gonna
kind of speed through this one and just
kind of go along its gonna take about a
minute and 30 seconds so I can jump to
the eye which is my favorite part of the
video but as you can see I went ahead
and prime my skin apply my foundation
and now I'm gonna go in with concealer
this one is from NARS and it's the
radiant creamy concealer and I normally
go in with my honest hace concealer but
I decided to just go ahead with the NARS
one instead I do plan on doing a video
for dry skin and tips for dry skin when
it comes to makeup so I'll just be on
the lookout for that just want to let
you guys know put that in the universe
and I'm just gonna take the age rewind
concealer which I used in my beauty on a
budget video and yeah this is definitely
gonna become a part of my routine
because I like the highlighted effect it
gives to my under eye and my forehead as
well now I'm going to contour with the
3d face creator that I also used in my
beauty on a budget video because like I
mentioned in the video it is much better
than some of the high-end contour
products on the market so yes I'm gonna
go ahead and just blend that in
and now I'm just gonna work on setting
my highlighted areas with my sauce ship
butter cup powder and my Laura Mercier
powder mixed I did mention in my
Highline contra video that I've begun to
mix the powders because the salsa is too
yellow because my skin has gotten too
pale because of the weather changes just
in case you're wondering and now I'm
going to set the rest of my face with
the fit me powder by Maybelline and yeah
I'm just gonna apply that all over and
then I'm going to bronze my face using
the Too Faced dark chocolate Soleil
bronzer and afterwards I'm going to step
away from my face while it is baking and
move into the eyes the first thing I'm
gonna do is just show you guys how I've
been filling in my brows lately and I've
been using the browsing by Benefit
Cosmetics I know I just did an update
abroad to toriel and I should have
waited until I got this product because
it is amazing it's absolutely amazing
you guys have been complimenting my
brows a little out lately and this is
exactly why so I'm just go ahead and
fill in my brows per usual and they were
gonna jump into the eye
the first thing I'm going to be doing is
priming my I using this primer from
shiny cosmetics it looks a little bit
great but that's because I had a little
bit of shadow on my brush
now I'm taking Mirage by makeup geek
cosmetics all shadows use will be makeup
geek and I'm just going to apply that on
my brow bone and then for my transition
shade I'll be taking sorbet which is a
very soft pink shade and I kind of want
to go a little bit cool tone for this
look and I feel like the codes I use a
pretty cool toned
now I'm taking curfew which is a nice
purple shade and then on top of curfew
I'll be taking Motown which is just a
deeper purple shade and after that I'm
going to work on just kind of blending
it out and creating depth by applying
sorbet on top just to smooth it out and
then reapplying the colors and then
blending them out and this should just
been my technique for all of my videos
now I'm just going to clean up my lid
and create a base and I'm going to be
using that same primer as you can see it
looks it's true color right now because
I'm using a brush that doesn't have
shadow on it and then I'm going to pack
sort babe right on top and then on
sorbet I'm going to apply my Mac mixing
medium liner and then I want to apply
reflex teal on top of that which is a
really really gorgeous pigment from Mac
and then I'm going to work on my winged
liner I'm going to be using a gel liner
as my base and then I'm going to switch
over to a liquid liner just to make it
nice and neat I don't really like using
a lot of gel on glitter because it just
turns out really really messy which is
why I switched to liquid and then after
matte liquid and then after I apply my
wing I'm going to apply my lashes these
ones are from the lower lashes then
they're called winging
now I'm just gonna pop in NYX jumbo
pencil in milk and my waterline and then
I'm going to take Motown and just place
that right underneath it is to add some
smokiness and to kind of up the
smokiness I'm going to take a black
eyeshadow and place it right on the
outer corner of the eye and just really
make sure it's nice and blended now I'm
going to take that same shiny primer and
then I'm going to take Mac reflex teal
right on top and then just dust away the
excess which is why baking is so awesome
because it gets rid of all that glitter
fall out and then I'm going to go ahead
and take sorbet just to soften it up
just a bit and then finish off the eyes
with their real mascara by benefit now
I'm gonna go ahead and just finish off
the rest of my face I'm going to take
summer fling blush by makeup geek first
and just pop that on my cheeks and then
to highlight I'm going to take so
Hollywood and star light mix together
and it created this nice
out-of-the-world highlight by the way
thank you to those who aren't gonna call
it the fact that you can see the lace on
my wig and thank you for those who
understand that the only reason you can
see it it's got to pull the hair back to
get the makeup on okay but I fix it at
the end and now to finish off the lips
or the look and do the lips I'm going to
take cherry blossom by coloured raine
and I'm gonna line my lips with that and
then I'm going to pop candy apple by
Anastacio in the center and I'm gonna
spray my face and then we have the
finished look I absolutely loved this
look I don't know what it was about it
but I just I fell in love with it now so
devastated I didn't get to go out with
it but if you recreate this look please
tag me on Instagram and all that stuff I
hope you guys liked it please let me
know what else you guys would like to
see and I will see you guys soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
