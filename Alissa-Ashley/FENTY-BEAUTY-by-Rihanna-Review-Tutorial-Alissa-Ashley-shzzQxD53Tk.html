actually already tried these products
yesterday I tried them on Saturday
because I wanted to really wear them I
want to see what worked best with them a
sponge brush what products all that
stuff I like to just sit down take my
time so I went ahead and did that so
this isn't a first impression this is
more so me showing you guys me John
makeup and just giving you guys my input
and just tips in my review on each
product because I did use them all
yesterday I conducted my wear tests on
the foundation to go ahead and show you
guys the photos right now this is before
like right after like I've done my
makeup and this is after a full day I
applied it in the morning so I can do a
full day and I want to say I took it off
of like 12:00 or 1:00 in the morning so
it lasted pretty well I just want to go
ahead and clue that in my video because
I know that some people really then do
wear a test but obviously this is a new
foundation you guys want to see how it
wears so here is how it wore via photo
comparison and yeah you guys won't hear
the rest of my thoughts throughout the
video so let's just go ahead and jump
into it and I hope you guys enjoy and
before we jump to the toriel we're gonna
go ahead and show you guys all the
products and give you guys the price
breakdown so
let's just go ahead and jump to the
video and I hope you guys enjoy it okay
so before jumping in I want to show you
guys the products I own about 95 percent
of the line here is a precision makeup
sponge and as you can see all the
details on the products are popping up
on the screen I went ahead and show you
guys the price as well as a brief
description these are things that were
said on the Sephora app based on the
product description so I am just showing
you guys what they claimed to do and
what they are just to show you guys the
product and yeah as you can see the
foundation brush is a little bit dirty
because I do use it later on in the
video here we have the blotting paper
this is 16 bucks and then we have the
pro filter instant retouch primer and do
not worry I'll be showing all of my
thoughts on the products later on in the
video I just simply want to show you
guys the products so yeah let me go
ahead and stop talking for a brief
moment and just let you guys just get
all the details that you can okay I'm
back just to talk for a little bit these
will be match sticks they come in 10
shimmers and 20 mattes I do not have
them all however here are the match
stick trios that they offer in light
medium tan and deep and then here are
the 5 shimmers that I have I am missing
a few but these are the ones that I
purchased at Sephora and then you have
the kilowatt freestyle highlighter
there's six different ones and they're
described as a cream to powder hybrid
highlighter here are all the duo's right
here as you can see swatched and then
here are the singles and this is trophy
wife which everyone loves and metal moon
and then lastly we have a universal lip
gloss and this is Finn teak glow and
that is it for my little swatching let's
get into the tutorial and I hope you
guys enjoy it okay so the first thing we
do is go ahead and apply the primer
we'll go ahead and just massage it into
my skin my first impression while
applying it yesterday is that it's not
one of those
silicon e primers and it's also not a
sticky primer it's kind of like a it's
more on the moisturizing side I would
say so I like that factor I do like
sticky primers a lot which is why I like
my very bougie Sisley primer but this
one's cool as well as long as it's not
silicone E and makes me throw out dry
next for foundation I feel like the
foundation in the line is what everyone
was the most excited about and I'm gonna
go ahead and let my thoughts pop on the
screen because I did try it yesterday
and I'm go ahead and show you guys some
photos as well actually I probably show
you in the beginning knowing how I edit
I'm gonna go ahead and apply the
foundation I'm gonna mix the shapes 370
and 410 and 370 it matches my skin
identical it's like right on point but
I'm a little more tan right now but I'll
go ahead and make some support in just
to give me a nice little tan so I get
two pumps of 370 and one pump of Horten
gonna apply that
and I'm gonna go ahead and use the
blending sponge that also came as a part
of the line it on AB lid out my
foundation now when applying the
foundation yesterday because like I
explained I want to test on the products
first I found that I did like it more
when blending out the sponge versus a
brush it just it looks more like skin I
mean I just like sponges so let me just
go ahead and conclude I was like sponges
for a foundation I just love the finish
of it and I mean not to say that it
didn't blend out well with the brush
I'll go ahead and show you guys on this
side I just fur a sponge and then taking
the foundation brush that came in the
line but go ahead and just blend out
this side and as you can see it blends
just fine I just like my sponges it
reminds me a lot of the Kat Von D
foundation brush where it's like flat
like this so you just kind of apply it
like that so it's really nice I like
this one
okay now in terms of the match sticks
I personally I'm not really necessarily
a huge fan of using anything other than
concealer under my eye I know some
people like to use the sticks for under
the eye as well as the contour but
personally when using them yesterday I
did prefer the contour ones more than I
did the under eye ones I think that I
just yeah I'm a concealer kind of person
so I'm gonna go ahead and use my
concealer and realistically speaking
because I do want to be realistic I
would use concealer every single day and
I want to really show you guys how it
looks in my foundation because
ultimately if you bought the foundation
you probably already have a concealer
that you liked so you may not have
purchased a matchstick so we're just
gonna see how it flows with the
concealer that makes sense
or concealer I'm taking my NARS radiant
creamy concealer I would love my
favorites
and then I'm gonna go ahead and use
these fun just to blend that out
with the forehead I'm gonna use the
rhombus side of the sponge and then from
under I am going to flip to the flat
side just to really get inside the inner
crevice because when I was trying to
yesterday I was like why can I get in
here this causes using the round side
you have to go to the flat side there do
another eye area now I'm gonna go ahead
and take my makeup revolution banana
powder like always and use a flat side
to bake it or just apply it I'm not
gonna bake but you know what I mean
it has a baking kind of notion I'm gonna
go ahead and apply my souffle two
o'clock powder just a little light layer
because this is a soft matte foundation
so it's alright kind of like as you guys
can see it wasn't super shiny it kind of
dried on its own a little bit so we
don't need that much powder necessarily
this just a part of my routine so I
gotta include it and then like always
got to take my spore microts mood in my
a 58 by more feet and just buff a light
layer onto everything that's how you
roll and I'm gonna go ahead and do my
brows off camera because the line
doesn't have brow products currently I
hope they do make some ventually and
I'll be right back next I'm gonna go
ahead and do my eyes and I want to a fun
look with the matchsticks because I just
want to play around with it so I'm gonna
go ahead and cry my eyes first let me go
ahead and apply a purple eyeshadow to
the crease area first
I'm gonna go ahead and apply more
lavender shade to kind of get the
purpley blue kind of hate going on my
eyes to match the matchstick I'm going
to use and then taking a small concealer
brush I'm going to take the matchsticks
and confetti and I go ahead and apply it
to my lid let me go ahead and apply
couple to my waterline as well just to
finish off the eye shadow I've gone
ahead and applied some mascara and then
I go ahead and just pop on the slash to
complete the eye look now I'm gonna go
ahead and contour and I use another
matchsticks for that and I'm going to
show you guys what worked best for me
when applying it because originally when
I was playing around with it I did
foundation concealer then matchsticks
and then powder but I mean for one some
of you I covered up and also I just
found that the method I'm going to do
now it just looked more natural and
pretty so I'm going to show you guys
what I did
I took the matchsticks I'm going to use
the shake truffle this is my contour
shade roll it up a little bit and I'm
going to take this little blending brush
from ELF and I'm gonna go ahead and
sweep it across the matchsticks just
like that
now I'm going to go ahead and apply it
right onto my cheek as you can see it's
applying really nice and soft just buff
it on remained on my forehead I just
found that it looked really good because
these remind me of like a like a powdery
stick it's creamy but it kind of
finishes nice and powdery so it's not
gonna look shiny so I just found that
applying it on top of everything and the
motion that I did it just worked out
perfectly it feels a little more creamy
it would not work out but since it's
kind of a creamy powder it worked out
perfectly
and then now that I have that ottoman
take my morphe PDA and just sweep over
it a little bit see how it's softened it
but still contour I'm such a great
teacher look at me now go ahead and wipe
my brush with a napkin just sweep it
back and forth and I'm gonna take the
matchsticks and chili mango and I roll
it up a little bit and take the same
brush and sweep it across just get it
nice on to the brush and I'm taking the
brush I'm just a packet where I blush
and as you can see chili mango has a
little gold shimmer so if you turn
different angles and may not look like a
blush so I'm gonna go ahead and apply
every dick just to add more of a blush
II kind of miss to my cheeks because we
dick is more pigmented in terms of color
they're both really nice a chili mango
I find is more so similar to benefits
California where it has that shimmer on
the cheek so you may not see the blush
you made you see a nice like ball of
shimmer which looks gorgeous I just want
more to blush you look today a little
bit it on top now for highlighting go
ahead and take the match sticks and
star-struck first and I'm gonna apply it
to be right here on the brush not so
much this part because that B be a
little bit crazy
I'm upon the edge of the brush and apply
it to my cheek C and then to highlight
on top of that I'm gonna take one of the
kilowatt freestyle highlighters and this
is trophy wife I'm gonna take the brush
it's the highlighter brush I'm gonna
show you guys the best way to apply it
because I'm sure you guys know that
trophy wife is more about glittery
highlight so if you were just sweeping
it and do this it may end up all over
your face when I was playing around with
it I found that when I kind just apply
like a normal highlight just flipped
across it did kind of get glitter on my
face and I was okay there's gotta be a
way to work this so I figured out the
best way to apply it so I'm gonna go
ahead and take the brush and take your
highlight dip it into the brush just
like that on one of the edges of the
brush and I'm going ahead and just pack
it on just like that
and then once I'm done doing that I'm
like tap off the excess and sweep it
across so as you can see and apply and
you don't see a bunch of glitter
everywhere so that's the trick you just
do this
do this and then sweep it because it is
really intense it does have glare I know
some people hate that but there is a way
to use it properly then go ahead and do
the other side just watch the other side
of the brush pack it on desktop and
sweep
and then from the cute spot in the nose
I'm gonna go ahead and take this duo and
I'm gonna take the lessons inside and
just use my pinky to apply it to the tip
of my nose and the bridge I'm also gonna
ply a little bit of that over the trophy
wife just because I want to mix in a
little bit of the whiteness of it and
max the purple better and then lastly
for the lips I'm gonna go ahead and take
the matchsticks and confetti first and
I'm just going to apply a little bit of
that in the inner part of my lip and I'm
going to take gloss balm and this is 50
glue and when I apply back to all of my
lips
and then Angela's pop to the look I'm
gonna act like it's ready to my brow
bone and inner corner because I can't
help myself okay so here you have the
finished look and yeah my overall
thoughts on affinity beauty so far is
that I like it I would definitely say my
favorite things if I were to like two
things are the foundation and the
highlighters these highlighters are
beauti beautiful so as I said hi as a
beauty the highlighters are beautiful
and I love the fact of the duo ones come
with two different options so I don't
know I thought that was very cool
because some companies that go for just
blinding blinding blinding highlighters
other ones a little bit more so
highlighters uses a super high-end
brands they do a lot of subtle cuz you
know realistically not everyone likes
that beaming glow but I like that it's a
duo so you get an option of a more
subtle highlight with less shimmer and
you get one that's really really beaming
so it satisfies both both parties the
less glow the more glow so I like that
about the highlighters and the
foundation it just wears really nice I'm
gonna go ahead and insert these photos
again to show you guys that it lasted
really long yesterday it was great
or tech maybe two days from now when I
post this but I just love the foundation
so I'll definitely be using it got a
support venti because it's just awesome
that they release 40 shades on their
first launch we always hear brands talk
about oh don't worry there'll be you
guys with shades in the next launch it's
like why can't you try to at least
attempt to do with the first launch or
the first release so I just respect it a
lot that they really put effort into a
full shade range I just I respect that
and I use brands I respect so you guys
are definitely seeing me use this and
it's amazing so that's a plus and I just
I'm just excited to see what Pinta
beauty has in store as I'm sure you guys
are as well I hope you can see some
holiday collections
excited I'm excited I feel yeah if I'm
inspired cuz with a new brand that we
could finally all stand for I'm just
excited so hope you guys are as well and
