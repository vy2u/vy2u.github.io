for today's video we have one that I am
hoping goes well I am going to be we
grabbed first this is the big bag I
bought a lot of Sephora bread make up
that's means a lot of money and I'm
determined to get this stuff in my face
because I bought this actually last week
but I didn't filming so many other
videos for you guys that I forgot about
and I was like hey Alyssa like you got
to use it so I am going to be doing a
whole face of Sephora collection of
Sephora brand however you like to call
it their makeup and we're going to go
through which stuff is worth the money
and which stuff is not so if you guys
want to see that then just keep on
watching and I hope you guys enjoy it
okay so for prior we're going to take
this Beauty amplifier mattifying h2o gel
primer I've never tried this before so
I'm curious interesting color it's like
a tan color which to me most primers are
always either white or when I think of
h2o primers I think of like a blue
primer so this is interesting
let's go ahead and put it on our face oh
okay I mean I would say that it
definitely mattified me I think I mean
he has no difference I feel the
difference I'm not sure if I like how it
feels on my skin yeah I'm not like dry
it feels right now I'm not liking that
at all but we're gonna move on and hope
for the best for foundation I have these
foundation sticks they're the make no
mistake foundation and concealer sticks
I have two shades I have numbers 11 and
13 let's see I'll show you guys if both
of them look like this is number 11 and
this is number 13 oh maybe 11 is my
shade I swear yeah when I mixed them I
thought I got a good shape but we're
just gonna do number 11 and see if we
have to add number 13 just in case we're
gonna take this Sephora Pro airbrush
Perfector brush to blend this in
I'm definitely glad that I decide to use
a brush to blend this out because I feel
like with a sponge it just I don't know
I think the brush is moving the product
in a really good way so I'm glad but I
hope you guys can see what I meant are
the reasoning behind me getting that
second shade this is very yellow and
yeah so I think that our hope that
mixing in this more kind of caramel
shade gives me a better tone maybe just
around the perimeter of my face cuz this
is like a yellow see how it looks better
already
it's matching much better okay so I
think that it looks pretty okay the
finish is very nice and I think that I
feel happy because that dryness from the
primer went away so I'm glad
so for concealer this is the gel serum
concealer the bright future gel serum
concealer I got the shade cream caramel
this is number 13 and I've tried this
concealer before but I did not keep it
on my face because I could barely get it
on my face because the old applicator -
this concealer was absolutely horrible I
think that some of the shades even still
have that same applicator and they're
switching them out which I'm happy cuz
this one looks so much better and you
can actually get on your eye but the
other one you can barely concealer on it
was horrible but this look I was just
gliding on that's so much better
so we're gonna go ahead and apply that
this is way better so I'm actually able
to give a critique on it because I don't
like a better get on my face I was like
come on man
I can see if I can't even conceal cuz
the wand get our little sponge out and
we're gonna see how this goes let's see
I think I'm gonna use this part for the
forehead okay okay so we're looking good
now let's go ahead and get our setting
powder I'm kind of scared I'm kind of
scared I wonder what the ingredients are
on this okay let's just just try it out
I do it this is what the powder on the
inside looks like I'm scared
we dip our sponge and we're gonna
go on top okay so this powder you guys
see that okay here's what I'm gonna do
it's a little bit cheating a little bit
I want to give the concealer a fair
chance because this powder is cancelled
because whatever it did to my forehead
it looks a mess like this looks wonky as
hell like it's not even at all so what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take some
banana powder for my under-eye because I
want to give this concealer a fair shot
and then I'm gonna use my micro smooth
to set the rest of my face and that's
Sephora brand so we're not cheating as
much but I want to get this concealer
throw a shot because whatever that is
did was terrible
then we're gonna take the Sephora micro
powder and the shade tan and we're gonna
set the rest of the face fix's forehead
because look at that like you guys
seasoned just like some yeah well I
don't know what the hell that powder was
doing okay I fix that disaster that was
a disaster don't get that powder that
was a disaster
oh okay I feel like the sponge kind of
picked up a little bit and see you under
there too oh okay you guys can see that
right oh no I have to fix that too
okay so now that our base is done which
I mean yeah that was about to go bad so
fast and so far I'm not like I don't
know how to feel as of yet I mean I look
fine that's gonna do a lot of fixing
we're gonna go ahead and do the eyes
okay okay so for my brows I'm gonna take
this yep
kit eyebrow editor that was called it
says kits or seals and I'm across that
eyebrow editor and this is medium brown
and number two seems to have a wax in
two powders I'm gonna take this Sephora
number 22 this is the angled liner brush
but I use this brush for brows or I have
in the past let's see how it works with
this product
Oh oopsie we're doing this and it's
covered in plastic
okay so the brow actually looks pretty
good is this the worst product ever used
my brows no is the best no I think I'm
more so used to my pomade so it took a
long time to do this so I'm gonna go
ahead and do the other brow off-camera
and I'll be right back
okay so the brows are done I'm actually
really surprised at how nice they came
out I think they look pretty good now I
think it's time to open this up
it's the uncomplicated brush sets for
the eyes if they're five must-have eye
brushes and includes a pro tutorial
inside I think that I need this one
right now because I need to clean up my
brows I'm going to take two concealer
and I'm actually gonna take the wand
itself to carve on my brows because it
seems perfect for that
and I might go ahead and set my brows
cousin see my hairs are just like
wanting to go down and this is the
Sephora clear brow gel which I have used
before and I do like it because of how
tiny the wand applicator is so for eyes
I'm going to take the Sephora warm
palette this is a Sephora Pro Pro
pigment palette to be more exact and I'm
just going to create a really simple eye
look I don't really feel like wearing
too much eyeshadow today so I'm gonna do
something really simple and I almost
forgot but I actually picked up an eye
primer so I'm going to use that this is
the beauty amplifier the beauty
amplifier prime eyeshadow primer
okay so I shadow is done let me go and
open up oh that's easy to open I just
twist it I'm gonna use the mascara this
is the outrageous curl dramatic volume
and curved mascara and I got it because
the wand looks really good I'm gonna go
ahead and choose my lashes I bought
quite a few and then in terms of liner
I'm not gonna do minor today because
I've been doing liner a lot lately but I
do have a liner from Sephora brand that
I like a lot and here is the one that I
would recommend because I've used it
before and it works really good and it
just I like how it dries down
it's really nice so check it out if you
are looking for a liner that is support
brand now let's go ahead and do the
lashes let the glue dry I'm applying the
Sephora and house of lashes collection
and this is in the shade machine this is
the style Natalia not for contour I was
going to use this little kit but I'm
pretty sure it's for blush so I'm not
bucks to here ruin everything I'm gonna
take the micro smooth but this is in the
shade deep and we're gonna use this to
see if it adds enough color for some
contour which it is yay
and then for blush I'm gonna dip into
this
is the spice market blush palette and
I'm gonna take this orange one that's
very pretty
honestly it's almost like a dupe for
NARS Taj Mahal blush very pretty this is
the luminizing palette and here's what
it looks like get into it and this is a
support collection fan brush it is
number 65 taking this one right here the
color of this highlight is very pretty
it's like a warm highlight a warm golden
highlight so I like that and then
because the Sephora collection has so
much stuff I just want to add in
something I'm gonna take this colorful
shadow and liner this is a matte one
it's waterproof and it's called French
line mate number 37 and then on top I'm
gonna take this Sephora Pro and neon
palette it's a pro pigment palette and
I'm going to pop this green as I say
orange it is green on top of this
and then for lips I really want to use
one of the new Sephora collection what
are these called lip stories I'm going
to take the shade 37 what is it Orange
this is honestly this is the best thing
I've used a side for my microscope
powder from Sephora so far for this
video okay when you open up my said and
spray with us okay this is no beauty
amplifier it's saying spray let's go
ahead and spray our face and then we are
done going it is currently 12 o'clock
actually exactly I'm going to keep this
on until maybe like 7:00 7:30 maybe 8:00
and I'm going to let you guys know how
it held up and we're gonna see how it
holds up because I would come back on
camera and we're gonna see what it's
looking like so let's go ahead and just
enjoy the day and I will be right back
with you guys okay so we are back the
time is currently 708 let me cover my
text 708 and here is how we are looking
and okay let's go ahead and just do a
breakdown I want to get to the good and
the bad the good I'm like Sephora
collection brushes the brows have stayed
in place all day and I mean it really
surprised me because sometimes brow
powders tend to fade and just kind of
dole down by thing the brows look really
good that brow gel kept them in place
the lashes felt comfortable at first I
was scared because the band is more
thick than I'm used to but they stay in
place I love love love the cream little
liner shadow pencils I like those a lot
that's stayed really well and as well as
the neon palette I like the neon palette
and I wanted to look with it so let me
know if you guys want that the eyeshadow
you guys are know I feel about the
suppor warm palette because I did a
video before what else the highlight
beautiful will definitely
using that palette again that blush
stunning I love the blush my cheeks look
so warmed the lip color as you guys can
see is gone because it went away as soon
as I bit into my burrito so I mean I'm
not to men about that because I mean
it's nothing to reapply it but just
letting you guys know it doesn't stay
but I mean I don't think you guys
expected that because it's a creamy
lipstick and if the bounds are kind of
you know get on the tortilla so I'm not
too mad about it and the color was
beautiful and it felt comfortable so
that was more important to me my
Christmas for the contour we'll be using
that again and I mean you guys are I
know how I feel about the microscope on
the face now let's talk about the bad I
feel like one Prag that's coming in the
middle of good and that that I have to
see again is the concealer because I
feel like it has potential but I want to
try it and incorporate it into my other
products that I know worked really good
and see if it flows naturally into that
before I give my final okay but it
doesn't look terrible it didn't actually
crease whatsoever so I mean yeah I guess
it's pretty good this mascara it
literally got a haul under here I know
you guys can see but the mascara
transferred the foundation it got
extremely oily around this area as you
guys can see and increased all right
here my chin is shiny my forehead shiny
my little pimple shiny because of the
shine so I don't think I'm here for the
foundation whatsoever and in terms of
the primer I probably won't use it
because of the fact that it made me feel
very dry the sponge that I use to apply
my concealer will not be using that
because I just did not like it
whatsoever and it's also extremely stiff
when applying the powder and that beauty
amplifier powder re told you guys is
canceled so you guys know that so yeah
that's just my final little say I think
I end up liking a lot of the stuff so
yeah that is it for this video if you
guys want to see me do anything else let
me know and if you guys like this video
be sure to give it a big thumbs up but
other than that thank you guys so much
for watching my videos and I
see you guys next time Pisa</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
