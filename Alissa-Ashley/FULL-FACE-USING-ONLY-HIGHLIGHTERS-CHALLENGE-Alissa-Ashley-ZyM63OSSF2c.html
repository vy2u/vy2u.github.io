per request okay this is you guys want
AXA for it I decided to do the full face
using highlighters challenge and this is
inspired by Nikita toriel's and Jeffrey
star they created this challenge
inspired by a makeup artist on Instagram
I'll leave her link down below I just
don't want to put her name because I
don't not brown since I'm be real I'm
not resonating I think it's Myra but I
don't wanna be wrong but it was inspired
by her because she did a full face using
highlighters and some people took it too
seriously my oil is crazy
but other people who recognize the fact
that makeup is supposed to be fun
sometimes really enjoyed it so I really
like the fact that they made a challenge
it's just fun you know I'm saying it's
really fun to not be so serious
sometimes
and obviously I'm gonna do a challenge
that involves glue duh like so I really
hope you guys enjoy it and again don't
take it too seriously you're sitting on
the broom right now just pull that out
of your behind and just enjoy the video
and don't take it seriously cuz nothing
too serious and let's get started let's
turn me into a 10 man okay so for
foundation I'm going to take the NYX
born to glue liquid illuminator and this
is some goddess and I think that I have
to mix it with my HD edit flash
illuminator just to make a little bit
lighter cuz yeah I'm not trying my some
dark my try to get my shapes I'm mixing
a bunch of it on my hand and we're just
gonna kind of see where it takes me
oh sorry okay okay I mean Dee's it just
uses one day like as a base for
foundation like it it's kind of give me
instant tan and I'm gonna find a little
bit concealer I saw people doing this
and don't tell me I'm cheating okay
because I saw people doing it so I guess
it's acceptable I jump a little bit just
so I don't look great
went ahead and did my brows off-camera
to say some time so the first I shed on
the tape and get it freaking open first
I shall meditate is max gold deposit I'm
going to use this I'm gonna place it in
my crease area which would be really
freaking weird oh my god it feels so
weird Prince Micah's area because
shimmers not be long in your freaking
crease I'm pretty sure everyone knows
that looks really really weird
I'm relate I'm going to take this ideal
duo by those two colors in the shade
shell it comes with a cream for the
cream on first and you get the pigment
on second
I'm gonna step away from the eyes for a
little bit and start setting my face I'm
going to take Anastacio so Hollywood
illuminator or so scared I really hope
this doesn't come on looking like crazy
I mean it but at least like level one
crazy guy level tan that little tin
please oh good
that's what kind of cute everyday look
huh for my contour I'm gonna take Matt
gold deposit cable II do you guys want
me to do this I'm doing it for you guys
so it's a liar snatch this news mm mm oh
my god Felicia wait
I don't you sexually I take my Becca
palette thingamajiggy and I'm going to
take the lightest blush the pink try to
OD on it
Oh God we're a little bit and I feel
like oh my under Artemis highlight a
little bit more so I'm gonna take my
mary-lou manizer that's like hello light
white pasty I'm gonna hope this
highlights
I need my eye a little bit it did okay
cool
really yep that took it there that made
me next level going back into the eyes I
definitely think this look needs a
winged liner so I'll go ahead and do
that
before forget imma go ahead and hire my
brow bone with my mary-lou manizer
highlighter laws well and then from lip
color honestly since this look is crazy
as as it is I'm gonna go ahead and
apply a blue lipstick this is Rockstar
my code rain cuz why not go ahead and
mix in some speechless which is another
kind of blue color and then my underarms
look really naked so I have some gold
deposit underneath so I don't look too
incomplete and go ahead and apply some
lashes a tigress by house of lashes and
the last thing you just set my face with
some send spray hope that this makes it
look a little more teasing okay so here
is the finished look
I really hope I don't look too crazy I
feel like I look insane but I really
guys like the video I like I like not
taking anything seriously like this was
a really really chill asset Oriole
because I didn't have to freak out about
everything and obsess about little
stomach to fix it was just fun so I
really hope you guys liked this video
