for today's video I'll be doing a full
face of Maybelline makeup so if you guys
want to see that then just keep on
watching and I hope you guys enjoy it
okay so first things first I'm gonna
take the master prime blur and
illuminate and one thing I'll say about
this is that okay on day one of
experimenting I apply it to the entire
face but I noticed that my nose got more
oily than usual especially with the
superstate Foundation cuz you guys know
I really like that a lot I found that it
almost kind of decreased the wear time
on it so I'm going to apply it to the
perimeter of my face because it's a
really nice primer it definitely
illuminated but I do not need it in this
area because I feel like it made it a
little oily I do not like that next I'm
going to take the superstay foundation
and I already have a full video or just
like a video of you on this foundation
so I'll link it down below but I do want
to mention that I took you guys advice
and I got a different shade so instead
of getting 335 which is what I thought I
was and I also mix in 355 I believe when
I thought that I was that shade I got
shade 330 and it's a really really good
match for me and yeah basically it fits
me better than the other two shades I
was trying to make work and I'm gonna go
ahead and just blend this in
next I'm going to take the instant age
rewind concealer and this is in the
shade golden and I love this concealer I
love it but the only thing that I will
say about it is that it is running out
fairly quickly I feel like I'm gonna be
gone with this or done with this in
about a month so that's not very fun but
luckily the price point of the concealer
is pretty decent it's really nice
everyone so I'm not too mad about it
like if this was like fifty dollars I'd
be like what the heck like why is it
like you know gone already but it's okay
that's the one thing that I kind of like
had a complaint about so maybe but then
again I use a lot of concealer so it
could be me could totally be me and by
the way I'm using this sponge from Sonia
Kashuk as I pronounced it at Target and
it is so good and I'm gonna go buy more
and I'm gonna stock up because it's so
soft the only thing I don't like about
it is that it's a white and gray sponge
and it gets dirty quick but it's like it
blends so we don't care and it blends
you're really good at that and it's G
and then I'm gonna go ahead and take the
fit me loose powder are lots of cap to
it I lost somewhere and see this one has
the cap so we'll use this for
presentation purposes and I'm gonna use
light/medium for my under eye and my
forehead and then I'm gonna use medium
for the rest of my face because medium
was too dark and it just got rid of my
highlight and I was like wow you're not
about to play me like this so I'm gonna
go ahead and use light medium for my
highlighted areas right now and then
instead of support micro smooth which is
what I'd love to use if you know my
channel and know my routine I'm gonna
take the fit me matte and poreless
powder and this is 3:30 toffee and my
eat at the 8th to do this and we're just
gonna buff this in okay so the base is
done now for the brows I have to use
another product and I'll explain why I
use 2 of the brow products and see how
they fight it on this dirty it's very
very dirty gets mine so I used this brow
product this is the told temptation brow
definer and the shape of the pencil it's
really nice and I also use the micro
pencil that they own and I wasn't a fan
of that one but the reason why I'm not a
fan of either is because the deep brown
for me personally was a little bit too
cool toned and I just yeah I cannot do
cool tone because it literally shows up
gray on me and unfortunately when I went
to go try to find more bra products I
couldn't find any so I'm sorry about
that I just I don't want
brows because they are not attractive
but I'm going to go ahead and do my
brows off-camera and then I'll be right
back
okay so for the eyes where to take a
couple things and my couple I literally
mean like three things okay so this is a
city mini palette and okay while this is
a really nice palette in terms of
pigmentation I use this one yesterday
it's not the most practical in the sense
that I cannot pick this up and do an
everyday look with it and honestly
speaking I mean that'll be really cool
because I mean it's a really nice
compact palette it's super small so if
this how like a brown maybe like a warm
tan shade and I'm like you know just
more mats instead of just like two mats
or three maxes and three of these
shimmers I feel like it would be really
really pretty for an everyday look
because you could just grab it and go
and just do it I look and that's just
that but the only color that excuse me I
really enjoyed was the brown I didn't
use the other ones because I mean
they're super duper shimmery and I
wasn't really into shimmer yesterday but
I mean this little pink one looks kind
of pretty so I may use that today but
yeah I just wish there was a little bit
more of a different sequence of colors
in the city mini palettes just as a
whole because none of them really draw
me in too much but this one do me in the
most and even this one I don't love if
that makes sense so because it doesn't
have a light brown shade for a
transition color I'm gonna go ahead and
take this master contour which I'm going
to be using later and I'm gonna take
that Brown contour shade and we're gonna
use that as our transition shade and
then from the city mini palette I'm
going to take this muted shade right
here just to blend this out
and they're going to go ahead defeat
Brown from a city mini pallet just to
pop on the outer part of the eye and see
it's very pigmented that was just one
day it's SuperDuper pigmented and it's
super blendable as well I just wish that
the color variations and sequences in
the palettes are a little more practical
because I think that if they were these
would be some pretty great palettes and
I'm only speaking for the ones I saw at
Target cuz there could be some out there
that are really really good but maybe
they were sold out but the ones I saw
they were all just very like I couldn't
see myself creating a whole look with
just that one palette and then I want to
go ahead and take onto that pinky salmon
color from the city mini and just pop
that on the inner part of the eye
and I'm gonna go ahead and just apply
those two brown shades to the bottom for
the eye just to marry it together like I
always do my next time I go ahead and do
a winged liner and this is the curva
tude liner and I love this I feel like
this is actually one of my favorite
finds when I was just buying the
Maybelline makeup and trying the new
stuff or it's not new but it's new to me
like the foundation isn't new to me so I
already knew the look pop it but this
was and I like it a lot so I'm gonna go
ahead and just do a quick winged liner
with this
see how this is nice and black wings are
done wings pop in and that's going to
pot some mascara so on my first day I'm
just trying not Mabley makeup I tried
the falsies push-up angel and I was not
a fan of this for my lashes personally
personally for my lashes personally it
did not work out very well because they
just did my lashes very straight this
works my friend jazz and I think it's
the one that she's actually like is
obsessed with she loves it stuff but I
think that like yeah my lashes they just
they need more curve and this one gave
me that and this one is one that I've
been using for years so I go ahead and
use this one because I know it works
good I'm gonna go ahead and take the
master contour like I mentioned earlier
and then we go ahead and not use the
blush in this palette because I want to
just buy a separate blessed just in case
you don't want to buy the whole palette
you just want to buy just one of
Maybelline's single brush brushes
blushes and do this is the pygmy blush
and this is 55 berry and with this it's
very pigmented so I just dip into it
once and just glad to cross the cheeks
and I actually really like this color a
lot because at first palm looking at it
I thought okay this is for sure gonna be
too intense which it could be if you
over apply it and overdo it but it has
like a sheen to it I think really
minimizes that intensity it makes it a
really nice blush and therefore
highlight I'm really not gonna do too
much because I'm just not in that kind
of mood I don't know lately I've just I
don't know I like being mad I don't
really like highlighting too much lately
it's really weird because normally I
love glow but if you do like
highlighting a lot I tried this on day
one of my little Maybelline testing and
this is the strobing liquid and this is
200 medium nude glow and I really really
like this product because it's not too
thick and not too thin of a product
where like do you ever know when you put
a liquid illuminizer on or illuminator
and it picks up the foundation this one
the formula doesn't do that so I really
like that so what I did was I put this
on and I layered on the master chrome
metallic highlighter and it gave me a
really nice glow but for today I'm only
gonna use my drop dude I'm only gonna
use the metallic highlighter the powder
I'm gonna use that day
and then from lips I'm sure you guys
want my opinion on the new super state
matte inks in my opinion is I'm not a
huge fan of them and the reason why is
because I just find they're kind of
sticky and I just they don't feel the
best on my lips personally I just I'm
not a fan of the formula so I actually
picked up this like regular lipstick it
is the color sensational and this is
9:40 touchable taupe I know it's more
safe because I always do these kind of
colors but I'm just a fan of them and
this I like tell it so creamy and she's
so pretty it's like the perfect everyday
lip color and then I'm gonna go ahead
and set my face in place with the master
fix we're boosting setting spray and now
I want to go ahead and put a little bit
on Master chrome highlighter on my brow
bone
okay so here's the finished look I'm not
gonna bomb falsies for now I may put
them on I don't think my photos later
but I'm gonna keep the look as is so
here is the finished look I hope you
guys like how it turned out
in terms of how I feel about Maybelline
as a whole I think that they're
definitely one of the top drugstore
brands in terms of quality I know
they're not everyone agrees Maybelline
because from my understanding I think
the last time I checked they're not
cruelty free and I know a lot of people
are definitely very strong when it comes
to their stance on cruelty free makeup
and they will not use it but for the
people who don't mind because ultimately
I know that we all just kind of have our
opinions on certain things and some of
us don't support some brands for certain
reasons some people they're very neutral
and they just use whatever is good so if
you're one of those people and you do
not mind
Maybelline not being cool to free then I
definitely recommend them to be one of
the drugstore brands you check out
because I feel like their products are
really high quality for the price point
especially their foundations amazing the
concealer is they're just really killing
it in my opinion so that is it for this
video I hope you guys enjoyed it if you
guys want to see me do a whole face of
anything else let me know
and just comment down the little brand
you want to see and I'll just going back
to stuff and get it done but other than
that thank you guys so much for watching
and I'll see you guys in my next video
