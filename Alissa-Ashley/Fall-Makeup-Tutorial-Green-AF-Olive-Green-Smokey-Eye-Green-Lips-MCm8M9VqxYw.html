okay
hey you guys went back to my channel so
earlier today you know cuz I'm a boss
and I gave my videos up the same day
that I film hit them cuz my boss earlier
today I was feeling very uninspired and
I just felt bummed out because I want to
get something up cuz been a minute but I
did not know what to do and I posted you
guys always of my back and a lot of you
were saying
olive green green so I asked you guys
and you guys you know you guys want a
green so I decided to do an olive green
smokey eye and originally I was any
basic and fair with the brown lip
because that's just what you do that's
what you do fall Brown lips I decided to
go green so it's a very monochromatic
look something I like it if you do be
sure to give a thumbs up and yeah yeah
let's just go ahead and do this also I
didn't do the face routine on camera
because I do have an updated face scary
face foundation routine coming up and I
just didn't want to do it all now and I
can do it in that video and focus on
that to tell you guys about all the new
products that I'm using so stay tuned
for that but without further ado let's
just go ahead and jump into the tutorial
the first day I might do is go ahead and
prime my eyelid using the honest hacia
waterproof cream color in the shade
honey and may use a more feet r34 brush
to apply this
this cream color does dry down but to
speed up the process I'm going to take a
morphe g37 as well as a loose
translucent powder just to lightly set
it in place next I'm going to use this
NARS I paint as base and I'm going to
take this morphe 17 to apply it and I'm
going to start on my lid first and work
my way upwards really having control
over where this product is being placed
so that doesn't go out messy
next using a more feet m4 for one brush
I'm going to take a makeup eeks
desert sand and apply that straight on
top of the green and then using a
morpheme 5:14 I'm going to take maybe
dirty martini and place that on my lid
as well as carried into my crease area
I'm then going to go back in with desert
sands and soften that out breathitt
bottom half of the eye I'm going to take
the morphe 36 as well as that NARS I
paint and when I apply this all in my
waterline as well as underneath
taking that same brush I'm gonna take
dirty martini and place that right on
top
and then I'm going to take desert stance
again and place that a little bit
underneath just to give it a softer
appearance then I'm taking this julep
length matters mascara I'm going to coat
my top and bottom lashes and then for
lashes I'm applying blue lash and style
tees gonna go ahead and warm up my skin
with this NARS duo that I can never
figure out how to pronounce so I just
leave in the strips and bar my belongs
I'm taking this morphe 3 to do so
I'm going to switch over to my in five
to four for my nose and my contour I was
taking this warmer shape i'ma take a
cool tone shape in my nose then for
blush I'm taking mimics summer playing
blush because I just love how peachy
orange blushes go with green where's it
at okay there and then for highlight I'm
taking this la girl strobe light
