in today's video I've partnered with
Sephora to bring you guys this makeup
tutorial that you see right here using
products that are new at Sephora hashtag
new at Sephora and they sent me items to
play around with that just hit the
market and they're perfect for the fall
season as you can see I created this
really nice fall makeup look I'm giving
you 5 eyes I'm giving you some nice kind
of peachy cranberry goodness and I used
products I knew at Sephora and basically
when you see the hashtag new at Sephora
that just means that these are new
products they're in the now and it's
great to follow those kind of hashtags
because you're able to see just new
things like sometimes I feel like you
know those new products I'm selling wait
a second what did that come out because
I'm just non Duluth so just keeping up
with a new exif or a hashtag will keep
you in the loop so you can be up to date
so I'm gonna go ahead and show you guys
some of the products I sent first things
first they send me the dr. Brandt no
more baggage and I use this today
because I've stayed down to one in the
morning last night haven't time my life
and I don't know I've been staying out
later since living in LA honestly but I
use this and this is an ID puffing gel
so you just apply it under the eye like
you will see me do in the video and it
kind of just relaxes the under-eye area
makes you feel more awake makes you just
kind of feel a little bit more better
about your under-eye area they also sent
me this from Too Faced and this is the
translucent smoothing finishing powder
and fuse with peach and sweet fig cream
or you could just call it peach blur
like it says on the front and you guys
know how I use my Sephora microtube
powder I essentially use this in place
of the micro soup powder so you will see
how that went down in the tutorial as
you can see I look pretty darn smooth so
I like this a lot they also sent me the
new Natasha Nona Lila palette and I was
quite excited to use this because I just
love the variation of shadow finishes in
the palette and yeah I mean I think I
create a pretty decent I look with the
palette so you guys will see that in the
tutorial as well
and then lastly they sent me some
perfumes and if you guys do not know
Sephora has a bunch of stuff they did
not just have makeup they also have skin
care products but I get a lot of because
I'm gonna dick it to skincare they have
fragrances and they also have hair care
products as well
so they have a bunch of stuff and I'm
glad they send me some perfumes because
I'm currently collecting socks want to
smell good all the time so I use this
one today this one is amethyst and this
is definitely gonna be like a favorite
of mine because I don't have anything
like it it's kind of like really like
intense in the sense that I feel more of
an adult when I wear it it just feels
really sexy but subtle because all the
other perfumes I have are either like
fresh or floral so I'm pretty excited to
have this this one is amethyst like I
just mentioned and this one is French
gray into both from Elizabeth and James
so yeah those are some of the products
that I'll be using today and I'll also
be using other items that are new at
Sephora as well so let's just go ahead
and get into this tutorial I will be
switching over to voice over so be
prepared to hear my voice the whole
video I hope you guys enjoy it and let's
go ahead and get started hello it's me
bare face me with brows already done
first I want to take the dr. Brandt no
more baggage ID puffing gel and I know I
don't have under eye bags however I feel
like applying this before applying
foundation and concealer almost a kit
like an under eye primer for my
concealer and it lasted longer I want to
try it out again I've only try it twice
so far but if my theory is correct I
will let you guys know anyways as you
can see I'm applying my foundation now
and I'm just speeding this process along
because I mean I do the same thing every
single time I'm using my Finn T
foundation and this concealer is the
NARS cream concealer and I will have
everything like shade wise listed in the
description bar below and like I said in
the beginning all this can be found at
Sephora go ahead and set my under eye
because it needs to be set and then
instead of using my Sephora micro smooth
powder my beloved Sephora micro smooth
I'm using this Too Faced peach blur and
I definitely recommend giving this
product a try if the micro smooth may
have not worked out for you because I'm
sure I got a lot of people to try it
because it essentially does the exact
same thing I'm using
for the exact same purpose same brush I
use it with but it doesn't have a tint
to it so it actually may work out for a
wider range of people because there's no
tint to it so you know you don't have
that fear of actually getting the wrong
shade and still give me that flawless
finish that I love and that you guys
love as well now moving on to eyes are I
went ahead and did one off-camera I'm
gonna step into the two-faced just
peachy velvet and matte eyeshadow
palette and I'm only taking one shade
from that palette just because I like
the orange and this is new at Sephora as
well and then I'm taking the Natasha
Nona Lila palette and I'm stepping into
nude vino which is a matte shadow and if
this palette is pretty cool because it
has a bunch of different shadow finishes
and I was able to play with three of the
four finishes so right now I'm using the
matte and next I'm taking Magnolia and
this shade is classified as a chroma
crystal so I'm gonna go ahead and pack
this onto the lid and then on top of
that I'm gonna take Cyclone and this is
a dual chrome and I added this because I
kind of want the look to just kind of be
like a bronzy pink it's hard to explain
what I was going for but adding this on
top added a different kind of vibe to
the look that I really liked a lot and
in the next step I'm going to go ahead
and line the waterline this is called
the lash line this little area of the
eye right here because I'm not wearing
lashes so I can't just want that to be a
little intense and then I went back into
the eyeshadow and I just added
amara which is also from the palette
just to add more of a pinky factor and
then I went ahead and popped on some
mascara and then I completed the
under-eye using the exact same shades
from the palette that I used on the top
part of the eye okay so I'm taking a
pencil brush and I'm just applying these
same shadows and I had to go a little
bit slow because I packed the matte
shadows onto my waterline and you want
to do this kind of take your time
because if you get a lot of shadow in
your eye yeah you're not gonna have fun
I get in my eye sometimes but as long as
it's not yeah you just don't want to do
too much okay you do not want to get a
lot in your eye and I might go ahead and
finish up this face we're gonna go ahead
and give me some cheekbones which I mean
my cheekbones they're gonna come back
just just give me a little bit you know
I'm healthy eating they're gonna be back
before
now we got a contour them on and I also
went ahead and added some light pink
blush nothing too intense because the
eyes are really pinky and then I added a
little bit of highlight I did not want
to go OD because I want the eyes to be
the focus so I kind it down on the
highlighting just a little bit and then
for lips I'm gonna go ahead and take the
Finn T Beauty match sticks in the shade
rum just to give me some slight shimmer
but also still nude and I'm gonna top
that with some Finn T Beauty gloss balm
and then I went ahead and put on my
sweater and then lastly imma go ahead
and spray myself with this Elizabeth and
James Nirvana amethyst and we are done
with this look okay so here we have the
finished look and how useful in the know
lash look I decided to not put on lashes
because I just want the focus to be the
eye shadow so let me know you guys like
it you guys not like it should I do more
looks without lashes let me know in the
comment section down below
but that is going to be it for this
video don't forget to check out the
hashtag new at Sephora to stay in the
loop because so many new products come
out every single month especially in our
little beauty industry so you want to
stay up to date and yeah that is it for
this video hope you guys liked it if you

will see you guys in the next one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
