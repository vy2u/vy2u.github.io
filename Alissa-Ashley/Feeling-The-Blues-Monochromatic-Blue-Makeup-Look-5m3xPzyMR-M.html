first things first I know that it's been
about a week now since I've uploaded and
I'm so sorry for leaving you guys for
that long without any tutorials and if
you follow me on snapchat and Twitter
you know that the reason why I had to
take time off is because I was an
emotional wreck honestly I don't know
what else I can describe myself as in
that moment but our family birdie
Theodore died and it was just very yeah
it's I gotta like think about it because
I didn't even sad again but it's like it
was very traumatic because she has been
well she was in my life uh for my whole
life because it was actually my mom's
Bert and she had her before we were even
born so it was very traumatic
so uh and I had just yeah it was just a
lot it was a lot to deal with and I just
had to take some time off because
obviously it's hard to film when you're
crying every frickin five minutes it was
really bad but I'm getting better now so
I feel Meghan so but it was really hard
to get back into the groove of filming
because I have a villain for so long so
I've been sitting in this chair since
like 7:00 in the morning trying to film
and I decided just channel my emotions
and you know lately I they're just
feeling blue
so I decided to kind of go with the blue
look and I really loved how turned out
and usually doing nice label looks puts
me in a great mood anyways so I just
like everything turned out and I feel
much better so hope you guys liked the
video
time check okay I'm talking a lot I
tried to explain you know what's going
on but hope you guys liked the video and
I will begin back into the flow of
filming um because I'm feeling much
better now
Sophie guys enjoy other mats you don't
want to talk too much and yeah let me
know in the comments section down below
what else you guys like to see and I
will see you guys in the video okay so
as you can see I already have my base
makeup on and that's because it's the
same that I've been doing as of late so
I just want to save some time also I
have my brows done using the BH
Cosmetics brow pomade and I
have a broad tutorial coming soon so I
thought it best to skip that as well
because I want to get straight into the
blue now the first thing I'm gonna do is
take this Sephora waterproof it's called
my boyfriend's jeans which i think is
such a cute name and I'm just using this
as a base my blue because when using
such vibrant colors you want to go in
with a cream base just so that the
shadow you use really sticks to it next
first shadow I'm taking the BH Cosmetics
modern neutrals palette and I was very
happy to see that I had a blue Navy
eyeshadow in it because I had only been
using the more warm neutral shades you
guys know me and my Browns and my orange
but it has a perfect Navy and a grey so
I'm using those two shades just to
really blend out the blue onto my eye
just to just really smoke out that loop
and then I'm just going to repeat the
same step for the bottom part of the eye
the actual eyeshadow portion is so easy
and so simple I want to keep it very
simplified so that the emphasis is on my
little nice sparkly wing I also decide
to pop in this Navy liner from hourglass
just to give the eyes a little bit more
of a pop and then I'm going to go ahead
and create a winged liner using some
cream liner and the reason it's
important to lay down a black liner
before applying any sort of color
whether it be blue red yellow doesn't
matter is because it's really going to
intensify it and it's also going to be
the base so you actually know where
you're applying this beautiful blue so I
just like to do this step first as a
guide next I'm taking this pigment from
Vanessa Marik's I don't know the name by
heart but it will be listed down below
and I'm just taking my Mac mixing medium
a liner and I'm just going in sections
and applying this pigment I decided to
do a pigment as opposed to a glitter
because I just love how it bounced off
of the light and also I don't know I
just I didn't want to do glitter I want
to do a pigment because pigments they're
more soft but in the same
instead they're more bold so I just want
to do a pigment and then after I apply
my pigment I'm going to take my lashes
and these are lenient lashes in the
style Naomi I want to take lashes that
weren't too fluffy because if they're
too fluffy then that just defeats the
whole purpose of adding this really
gorgeous sparkly metallic e wing so I
want to do that next I'm taking this
benefit they're real mascara but this is
their blue one I kept going out of focus
super annoying but I want to do blue
mascara because I mean it's blue so why
not and then on top of that I took a
very thin coat of mixing medium by Mac
and then I took that pigment I almost
want to create the effect of like little
kind of sparkly tears it's hard to
explain but it just really worked with
what I was going for and now I'm gonna
take this BH Cosmetics palette and this
is from a marble collection it's new and
it's called cool stone and I'm just
popping in the white shimmery shadow in
that palette and I'm going to take their
wild in a lowering palette and pop on
some nice blue because I have really
pretty blue and now I'm going to go
ahead and step away from the eyes and
contour using my NARS contour blush and
I just I love this contour and I kind of
contoured heavy because I just want to
look very bold and fierce and then I
went back into the wild in a learning
palette and took that really nice pretty
pink blush it was so gorgeous
and I love how pinks and blues go
together and this blush was very soft
and illuminating or whatever the word is
and then for my highlight I actually
took a white eyeshadow in the modern
neutrals palette
lately I've been liking highlighting
with white eyeshadow don't ask me why I
just like how it looks now for the lips
I took a black liner this one I believe
is from Shu a it kind of broke off on my
lip and I used this to line my lips and
then after I was done lining them
I took the my boyfriend jeans a jumbo
pencil and I just really blended those
two together and I was quite amazed by
how comfortable this was on the lips I
wasn't expected to be that comfortable
because their liners
and then in these Center I put that
donessa Meyer eggs pigment and it really
just yeah it made the lip look amazing
it looked like water it was beautiful
and then for some last final touches I
decided to go in with this brow pomade
that I mentioned was from BH Cosmetics
earlier and I just want to go ahead and
just intensify the brows because bottom
line they were not intense enough for me
and my personal liking and this is a
bold look so I got to have bold brows
and then I also decided to go ahead and
just intense on my nose contour a bit
just to make sure the nose is snatched
and then this will be the final step in
this look I really hope you guys like
how it turned out if you did be sure to
give it a thumbs up other than that
thank you so much for being here and
watching and I cannot wait to see you
guys in my next tutorial and I will see
you guys soon
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
