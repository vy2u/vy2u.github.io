as of lately like the last month or so I
have noticed that pictorials on
Instagram have become like a thing again
like I remember I did a pictorial once
in my brows I remember so excited I got
repost it I was like oh my god yeah good
times
super excited but then I feel like
Instagram pictorials and just pictorials
in general they faded away and we moved
more into video stuff which I'm happy
about because I love video but
pictorials are making a comeback and
I've been seeing a lot of them on my
timeline by a certain someone and I
decide that I want to I'm scared I want
to try to follow their Instagram
pictorial I'm not sure if anyone else on
here has done this idea before if you
have what I went looking on YouTube and
I did not see any pop-up so I don't want
step on any toes but I did not see any
of these sorts of videos pop up when I
typed it in and no one has followed a
pictorial so I'm not copying anyone and
if you think I did I'm sorry so without
further ado let's see if I could follow
this Instagram pictorial okay so
naturally I'm not a punk I want to do
something that's got challenged me I
want to be something that it's gonna is
gonna scare me and I decided to do this
one right here I allowed to pop up and I
just insert a little screen recording of
the actual pictorial itself and this is
what we are going to attempt today so
let's see there's no descriptor or
description that says which palette was
used so I'm just gonna like bring
together a bunch of colorful palettes
that I have to create this I am so
scared it says that she was inspired or
this is a recreation from Belinda rose
I'm so shout out to her for the inspo
and also in spa from the lovely Miranda
Blake 41 I just want to make sure I'm
crediting the right people you know I'm
saying she's out to you guys it's so
creative so I am gonna I guess get
started do this my brows are done really
lightly because I just I need to make
sure I have enough room for this look so
the brows gonna have to wait to laugh
which is really weird for me but let me
see I'm gonna just start there's nothing
in the pictorial that says that there's
an eye primer but I am going to assume
that there is so I'm gonna take my P
Louie's eye base in the shade rumor
three and we're gonna apply this to our
eyes we are gonna apply this I'm like
actually literally scared because I mean
I know how to blend don't get me wrong
like I'm not gonna you know see hearing
and dis myself but can i blend like this
I don't know I actually really like
pictorials because there's something
about them I see a lot of them on my
feed I always want to click on them
because they always start like this and
it makes you want to know okay what does
that guy turn into I think that's why
the first step that they usually show
isn't the priming part because think
about it would you rather see this like
okay like this that or just a random
unblended eye shadow you're like okay
what on earth is going on I'd rather see
that so I think that's the peel of them
okay so I think that I'm gonna take this
Natasha Nona tropic palette and I'm
gonna take Laguna because it seems like
the closest blue to the one in the photo
and I am going to let's see I guess I'm
just gonna put blue all of my eyes I'm
scared okay Lee make sure this split it
out okay I'm gonna try to make sure it
looks exactly like it this is already
going bad
I gotta brush is this what brush am I
using oh my god okay this is this brush
I'm taking a different brush because
that one is like I don't know what is
going on okay so you just apply the blue
I feel like whatever blue cheese isn't
is better than this blue clues I don't
know what's going on okay I think that's
pretty good okay so now let's go ahead
and swipe any swipe
let's see what's next okay so I got I
got a do this um how the hell how does
she do that oh my god why did I decide
to do this one at all okay okay so I'm
gonna take this morphe m2 13 it looks
tiny enough to get that result and work
on it we're gonna aim for it we're gonna
we're gonna do it okay so it seems like
oh my god it seems like there's little
points
okay so I think there's definitely a lot
more blue in the inner part I like the
little spikes they seem to be going more
further in okay let me put some more
blue with this brush first it kind of
seems to go off into the brow a bit I
mean I think it looks pretty legit okay
looks pretty good to me
so now let's see what's next I have to
add help ah okay um okay I think I know
what to do okay let's see I'm gonna take
the life's of drag
oh she probably used she probably used
the life to dress pellet the blue I
forgot I'm gonna take pageant queen and
life's a drag and we're gonna add some
purple oh god I'm not good this it seems
like there's a space a little bit I kind
of gotta make sure I don't get rid of
too much of the blue I think I'm doing
kind of good okay so now that I have
this I am gonna take my other brushes
the more people I eighteen and we're
gonna blend this down
okay so what's next okay so next we have
to add peak okay they might take the
same brush and we're gonna add some pink
I'm doing this right
I thought this looks so bad okay looks
good to me now what is next girl okay
so it seems to be the yellow is next
step and that yellow mixing with the
pink created an orange but I don't know
how I'm gonna get that but we're gonna
try it anyway okay so I need to do
yellow why is it not blending into oh my
god okay it definitely doesn't look the
same but I'm just I'm going based on the
pictorial I think there may be a little
bit of orange in there so maybe I can
put some right here okay Adam my yellow
I guys have to go to the next step
there's green okay is there cream in
this palette No
do I have a palette with a green ooh I
have this one right here by Sigma it is
the creme de kotor and it's a pressed
color palette and i'm gonna use citrus
pistachio
okay what's next
oh my god she doesn't skipped to like
three other okay so I have to put blue
under here and purple okay
okay what's next okay so it seems to be
like a white add it right there so now
we get at that and use a different brush
though okay what's next
lashes that's it okay I tried to find a
lash I had the same sort of effect I
think that's the closest I got okay
sorry know how I personally feel about
it um I think I could have did better I
didn't I know it's gonna be that hard I
don't know but let me go ahead and cover
seal and let's see how she feels about
it let's go ahead and call her did I do
okay my blending is yeah so it's okay
that doesn't look good
okay yay okay bye okay well I mean a
corner OC oh I did it
I thought it's a piece of cat hair on my
nose but according to her I didn't do
the kind of a job so honestly hearing
that just made me feel a little more
confident about it let's get up close
yeah I mean I don't think I did that bad
of a job I'll bet it at that bad what do
you guys think granted I feel like what
would have worked out better well for
one I hate false lashes like that are
thick so it's driving me nuts but for
one I feel like it would have went
better
if after the blue and the purple and the
pink that I put down some more I base on
the base part of the eye that way the
colors of the yellow and the green
and even the pink and even that kind of
orange II it showed up more because I
was trying to do it it was just blending
it to oblivion so I think if I would
have done that I think that this would
have looked pretty spot-on probably not
as good but I'm pretty okay with it I
think I did I think it okay like now she
told me I did I'm like hey you okay I
did okay but that is it for this video
if you guys want me to follow any other
pictorials feel free to send them my way
on Instagram and yeah maybe we can do
this again sometime because I think it
was quite interesting following a
pictorial versus an actual makeup
tutorial because it's just like there's
not much of a description you literally
just kind of have to use your own little
okay like what should I do and I don't
know I thought that was pretty fun I
enjoyed it and I'm glad I picked
something I was a little more
challenging because usually I'll just
opt for the bronze II stuff but that is
it for this video I hope you guys
enjoyed it and if you did be sure to
give a thumbs up other than that thank
you guys for watching I hope I did a
good job let me know in the comment
section down below and I'll see you guys
in my next video peace up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
