today's video I'm going to show you how
to achieve this very nice glowy spring
fresh spring look with nice natural
brows I did get up close to show you
guys how I do my little feathering
technique and yeah it's going to be balm
and it's really simple I feel like this
is perfect for everyday you know it does
have a lot of steps I still think it
looks nice and good I loved this looks I
hope you guys enjoy it I'm not going to
talk too much
let me just shut my ass up and let's
just get tutorial cuz gonna be a top
room so it might be a little bit long so
hope you guys enjoy it
so let's go okay so you guys it is hot
as hell today which is why I decided to
do this look today no I plans it out
because right now it is 81 degrees for
primer today I'm going to use my skin in
a via oil control primer spray and the
reason I'm using the oil control is
because during the summertime this area
decides it just it gets greasy enough to
fry chicken on my face so I want to make
sure that's all in control and honestly
like I just like spritzing myself
especially that's hot it's hot to tell
my room so I'm just gonna turn this
summertime I don't really like using to
me like creamy like the primer just
squeeze I don't know what how to what do
they call it creamy primers I don't like
using those because I feel like the more
makeup I put on my skin the less is
going to last because it's just so caked
up basically so I feel like spraying it
is just like a step you know still a
step but it's like a more lightweight
step if that makes a stat all let me
shut up I like this sprayer I'm going to
take this radius bronze foundation
primer from Laura Mercier and this one
isn't really too prime it's just to add
a glow to my skin before I put on my
foundation so that it can radiate from
the phone illusion that makes sense I'm
just putting on the high points of my
face because that's why I wanted to read
it the most and it's going to do just
that I'm going to use a mixture of my
George Armani luminous silk and my YSL
Touche clot or
but I looked into club they change
this crap they change it alright I have
old bottles still a tint to shake lot
but now they're freaking alright hard
enough to frickin pronounce and I'm just
gonna mix these two together the reason
like mixing them is because the George
are mine is too light for me and the YSL
is too dark and like the formula both oh
no I'm running out of my Armani got take
a damp Beauty Blender and just bounce
bounce baby for concealer I'm going to
take the LA girl Pro concealer in the
shade pure beige I would have taken my
back concealer that I just recently got
it's way too thick for the look I'm
aiming for so I'm going to take this one
instead and apply very thin amount
not going to take a mixture of my Laura
Mercier and maybelline powder just set
all the concealer in place
I'm shaking a fluff of your breath for
the rest of my face
for blush I'm going to take this NYX
cream blush this in the shade orange I'm
gonna take my Beauty Blender just really
get into that blush I'm going to apply
like I normally do my blush like in the
same area but just with a sponge if this
cream it's just going to you know look
more radiant and nuts or matte for
highlighting I'm gonna take benefits Sun
beam and I'm taking this because it's
not super duper glittery and that's not
really what I'm aiming for
and first gonna take my finger you know
come a little bit nervous about this I
don't want to take too much just want to
take a little bit at a time just placing
my finger and then take my Beauty
Blender and just work that into my skin
you just want to take it in little
increments you don't want to take too
much because then it may pick up your
powder and it's going to become a hot
mess you want to take it very very
lightly and just gradually illuminate
your cheek or whatever it is there is
now I'm going to work on setting these
and this part is a little bit tricky
because you don't want to you know sweep
your highlight on it because it's you
know creamy so it's going to be a mess
if you do that I'm going to take the
laura mercier face illuminator and yeah
it's definitely illuminating and I like
it because it's nice and smooth
it doesn't really have a lot of chunks
in it at all and I want to go for
something more smooth so I'm just going
to place it as you see I'm being very
cautious I do not want to mess up see
how they look very illuminated from the
side that's why I'm going for a little
bit on the nose nothing too extreme on
the nose for blush I'm going to take the
morphe three brush not blush and wit
take NARS libertate a nice peachy blush
and you want to make sure take a nice
brush somebody applies brushes you want
to make sure to take a nice soft blush
brush for your blush and I'm just going
to dab it very lightly right on top a
little bit on the nose okay so first
we'll take my mac studio finish
concealer on my royal and langnickel
brush and I am just going to create my
brow first and what I mean by that is
that I'm just gonna see you know what
I'm gonna be filling in so I'm just
going to outline it
now I'm going to take my honest hacia
dipbrow in the shade
auburn on my makeup addiction angled
brow brush and i'm just going to begin
making little strokes if you find your
strokes are too dark like these ones are
just brush them out with the spoolie
you want to make sure you create the
strokes in the angle that your bra goes
or the direction that your brow grows so
looks the most natural
I'm going to take my Marc Jacobs brow
pencil this is the shade ash brown I'm
just going to go in and do more brows
strokes or brow hair strokes but this is
a lighter pencil so it's not going to
look too crazy so the strokes that I
made with the dip brow they're going to
look more dominant to this pencil now
I'm going to take benefit browsing in
the shade medium I know it's a lot of
steps but I'm trying to get you know
some nice dimension going on and I'm
just going to take it in the areas that
I feel needed
I'm going to go back on my concealer and
just kind of clean it up just finish it
off make sure everything's nice and neat
I'm kind of brushing it upward because I
feel like I got too much of a sharp line
I don't want that now just go ahead and
fix it or fix whatever I need to fix but
I don't want that sharp line right there
so I just want to brush upwards to get
rid of it
it helps to kind of raise your eyebrow
so you get really really you know tight
skin right there just it'll mess up I'm
going take my honest hacia clear brow
gel just to make a little more texture
as well as set it in place then for eyes
shut on actually I just take my
two-faced dark chocolate soleil bronzer
on my morphe scratched out glad so long
now just take it right on the outer
corner just to kind of lift my eye you
see I'm not bringing it in I'm not
applying too much I'm just really
focusing on that outer corner let's go
just lit my eye shape for lashes since I
didn't do I shadow I want to wear lashes
that were natural about the same time
you know still made an appearance on my
eyes so first I'm just got code my
lashes very very thinly very family
what's the mascara this is the
Maybelline sensational I'm just going to
take my throat cause metics lash glue
and just apply my lashes and I'm going
to somewhat heavily coat my bottom
lashes with mascara I'm going to
highlight my brow bone just a little bit
to bring it up a bit make it look a
little more lift it
then my last and final step will be to
set my face with my skin navy and makeup
finishing spray this is also oil control
just like the primer spray and this is
going to make sure all this lasts all
day okay so I'm going to take my lip
color because I feel like that one
didn't scream spring and I want to
scream you know fresh spring so let's
just kind of alright so this is pretty
penny by dry cosmetics okay so here's
the finished look you guys I am loving
this I just I just feel so glowy
don't don't don't feel I don't I'd look
so chloeb I really like this look I hope
