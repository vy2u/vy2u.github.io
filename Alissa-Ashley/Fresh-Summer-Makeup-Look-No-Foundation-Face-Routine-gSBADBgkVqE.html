I just wanna not very hydrating without
being too oily I don't want anything
that's gonna be too like boiling crazy
why this fall on my face go ahead and
just tap this in okay so the next thing
I'm going to go ahead and do is conceal
I'm going to take my NARS radiant creamy
concealer and I'm just going to place
this one all the places which is my
highlight areas with the Sun in my eyes
drive me nuts hold on I'm just applying
this under my eye light on my forehead
there are my mouth tube
I'm gonna go ahead and blend this out
with a blending fun systems by Tarte

supplying it to the sides of my face go
ahead and blend it out with this Tarte
sponge
thattaboy I take my makeup revolution

going to set my under eye as well as our
forehead because my Egypt the egg does
up in the excess powder
I'm eating some of that powder on the
sides of my mouth as well and I'm gonna
set my entire face using my microscope
'n my - was clouded by sephora using
that ich is the 8 brush then i go ahead
and take my wander beauty go go glow get
or miss and i'm just going to go ahead
and spray my face now that I have all
that powder on because I want to really
seep into my skin and the workout and
everything else because I want to look
nice and fresh and I'm going to take the
back part of the Tarte sponge and I'm
just kind of patting it in I like to Pat
my sprays in I thought it gives a nice
pretty look when I do that and now I'm
going to go ahead and work on the eyes
and step away from face for a second to
fill in my brows I went ahead business
off Karen because this is my problem row
and it just always give me a hard time
so I just want to like heat it out the
way I'm get taking this benefit
precisely my brow pencil is from the
shade number 4 and as you can see I just
go to my brow really naturally now car
is going by really naturally and I just
followed my natural brow shape I'm go
ahead and do the same thing to this brow
ball and and now
shape mimicking little brow hairs I'm go
ahead and set them in place with my on a
socket clear brow gel then go ahead and
wipe off some of this little excess
concealer that got on my eyes off and
I'm gonna go ahead and prime my eyes in
my Smashbox 24-hour photo finish primer
I love this primer I would have never
expected like a primer that didn't have
a tint to it I usually like to use a
prime enough tinted or use concealer but
this primer it really makes your eye
shall last all day and it makes
everything stick to it without having to
like set it with powder so I really like
this one for my eyeshadow my take color
range gingerbread and it's a dose of
color blending brush and I'm just going
to pop this into my crease area so I'm
taking color trains angel face I will
pop is my brow bone area next I'm taking
call it rains s'mores
almost dropped it and it's a really
slight shimmer brown shade and pop on
the lid going back in with Gingerbread
for the under eye area this is a morphe
brush I'm going to take the s'mores
shade as well and I'll go ahead and step
away from the eyes for a second and work
on the rest of the face I have to bounce
back and forth is the kind of peace out
my look I might take this chanel healthy
glow sheer color and number 70 i'm going
to take my morphe for just go over my
whole face
now I think this Mack cream color base
in rich Coral
and now I'm going to move back into the
eyes before do my highlight I like to
finish the eyes before I do any
highlighting so I'm taking my Maybelline
lash sensational mascara and just pop
that on her lashes and taking these wash

therefore highlight we're going to get a
little bit of a Mack
taraji glow and this is the Sephora

of the mouth
I go ahead and take this milk makeup was
it's a blur spray and I'm not going for
a matte look well since I know that the
combination to everything I use today is
going to be more on the dewy side I do
want to spray a matte spray after
everything so it'll last longer the
other day good I mean now I'm going to
do some finishing touches I want to take
this Stila stay all day dark brown now
