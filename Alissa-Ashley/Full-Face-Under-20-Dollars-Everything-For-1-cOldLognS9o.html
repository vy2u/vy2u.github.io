video is going to be a challenge it is
the $20 makeup challenge I don't know
who to credit because it's been done by
so many people I think it's just kind of
a a youtube challenge just like I mean
people just do it so don't attack me but
I just want to do something a little bit
different
also I got a bunch of stuff from shop
miss a they are sponsoring this video
and if you haven't heard of shop miss
AECOM they are a site and everything is
$1.00 I actually learned about it like
years ago when I used to freelance and I
bought all my lashes because it's like
everything's a dollar so it was easy for
my kids so just a little tip if you are
a freelance makeup artist have good
lashes but this is my first time trying
like multiple things like foundation
stuff so I'm really excited so you want
to see whatever I decide to create on my
face they just keep on what okay so I
actually have all my stuff in this box
right here I just got this morning so I
did wanna open thing I want to like
space of the first impressions of all
these things so I got a brush and this
is an AOA Studio High Definition brush
this one looks like so I'll be using
this like for my foundation and all that
stuff and for foundation it's called
Santi aqua stylish silky milk Foundation
SPF 20 it is in the shade 12 takes let's
do this
alright I have high hopes for this I
wasn't expecting it to be this like hard
coverage it is a little bit difficult to
play a little bit but for it to only a
dollar so far so good it's covering
pretty well it so it's a little bit
yellow so it's good thing I got to the
foundations this is the shade number
nine so what I'm going to do is I'm just
gonna take some number 9 take some
number 12 and I'm the boots cause a lot
I'm going to mix the two together and I
think it's gotta tone down the yellow
just a little bit okay let's just boom
it out
it looks really good so let's hope that
I like the concealer it's more into that
now okay so now for concealer I did buy
one of these sponges on the site but as
you can see it is massive it is massive
so I'm not sure it's gonna fit into the
eye but we're going to try it out if it
does not work out I bought these
assorted sponges but this is just like
we're putting some backburner it's see
how this works first I just wet it in
yeah it's yuju for concealer I got the
santi concealer and foundation it's a
two in one and this in the shape here
beige see how this works okay so I may
have gotten too light of a color uh-huh
but we're gonna make it work I always
like to make things work so it's totally
fine
I'm just trying as flaws as possible I'm
really gonna put some effort into this
beep it's still in the forehead
hey bad I don't add the link it's not a
fan of I so let me try it first now it's
not a Beauty Blender but for it to be
only a dollar which is like what is that
$19 less than the Beauty Blender it's
nice not that bad
yes that is very bright we're got to
tone this down I got the wrong shade
it's totally okay not gonna freak out
okay so I also bought these what is this
a value pack assorted sponges so I used
one of those funds in here just to set
it on your eye and this is the malleable
glitz face powder and this is the shade
medium I kind of already start to set it
over here because okay I needed just
testing I know one ruined this work I
really want to work out so our pen
already started so I'm just kind of
swirling in the powder and going
directly to I see how toned it down so
now that worked out that's a good tip
for you if you do get a shade concealer
that's too light and you just kind of
don't have time it'll get
the one just use a powder that's
basically your skin tone or just a
little bit lighter and use that to set
it I'm think I take another sponge in
the little assorted kit thingy and I'm
just gonna set my forehead this is it an
entire face I guess I guess you can see
that that's what I'm doing right now
this takes longer but I didn't get any
more face brushes and I really really
want to stay true to the challenge and
not use any morphe brush or anything
like that because I know it's gonna just
add up between dollar price so I'm
really trying to stay true you guys and
try to stay true okay so now let's move
on to bronzing up the skin opening up
next product actually comes with a
sponge on the back of it so that's
pretty cool and this is the CIT mineral
press two galaxy powder and it's just
like a bronzer you open it up it's like
a bronzer so and they use that same
little spunk I like the angle on it I'm
going to take the deeper shade just to
contour whoa that's pigmented I wasn't
expecting how much pigmentation oh my
god I was not expecting that was
pigmentation I was just expecting very
very light bronze with a man what the I
just want us outta my god and then for
blush I have this amused a rosy blush
duo so one of the colors is very vibrant
Barbie pink and other ones more subtle
so I'm taking more subtle woman I don't
crazy and even the more subtle one is
like utils gonna be pigmented so you've
got to be careful for brows I have this
clean color eyebrows essential kit it
comes with a brush and the power to go
ahead and open it up oh it also came
with stencils we came a little stencils
open this up and let's try to do a rose
hello I do not have this brush is gonna
work because kind of want the fluffy
side but just see
a little warm tone it's Auburn but I
think that looks not that bad look
pretty good pretty good
okay let's move on to the next step now
since the concealer wand is whatever you
call this shape of a wand I'm going to
remove some of the concealer from the
wand first just so it's not too packed
up a concealer and I'm going to try to
use the wand to clean up my brows
it actually worked quite well
let's go level with go ahead and use
concealer to prime my eyes as well now
for eyeshadow I'm coming fool because I
only got one brush it's got a big so I'm
just gonna have to hope for the best
okay and this is the LA Colors matte
eyeshadow this isn't a shade matte to
nificent oh I get it
it's like Maleficent but you did okay
okay so I'm going to start with the
lightest purple shade right here oh and
this is a what is this I am a studio
High Definition brush let's go ahead and
just place the light purple first it's
very very light purple so maybe I can go
to the second line of purple
I'm going to take this blue because I'm
slightly I'm so to do the MOTU
I'm used like the angle of the brush to
get into the crease area so it doesn't
get all over my eye and it for under the
eye I'm going to take the little sponge
applicator just to get underneath there
gonna place this blue on my lid as well
it's pretty good
not my best work with pretty good and
then I got this Santi shimmery eyeshadow
stick into a grayish color so I'm gonna
pop this right as intern for a little
bit of a sparkle okay so for lashes I
already have one on because I did have
to cut it down a little bit because my
eyes are hooded together I know the deal
but they are the car eyelashes in the
style for 15 I actually bought the same
hair I used to stack up on when I was a
freelancer so I can just kind of relive
the car for 15 so I'll go ahead and pop
this on and then uh I kind of realized
that I did not buy a freaking highlight
Who am I
who the heck am I so I'm going to take
this clean color alpha girl holiday
romance shadow and liner brow kit okay
and this one looks like you just open it
up on I might take this yellow shell
right here and I'm just gonna try to
fake it and act like it's golden I think
it'll work
I should see it give these my life I got
big time making you know me
that's good enough
and lastly from the color I'm going to
take the clean color madly matte lip
gloss and doesn't have a name on it and
I'll have a link down below it's a
really nice ma'bud pink you know I had
to get a pink
so here is the finished look and I think
that it came out pretty good for what
it's worth and I think that I stayed
unemployed ollars actually my max was
twenty dollars I think I was under it
but did not use everything that I got
from the site so high five to me but I
