so for today's video at first it was
just going to be a review and where a
test on this here foundation but you
guys kind of got lucky because I got
unlucky and my microphone was unplugged
the entire time so the footage was
basically worthless
so I decided okay why not just turn
negative into a positive and let's just
go ahead and do a full drugstore beat
because I just know I feel like I use a
lot of high-end products here on my
channel so why not switch it up and give
you guys a full on affordable makeup
look
I created this right here and it's a
really nice everyday look or just a nice
summer look it could really be anything
you want it to be and I also made sure
to include my thoughts on the foundation
as well because I wore it for a full 12
hours so if you are interested in that I
do include that as well yeah other than
that a piece of cat hair on my face and
I'm feeling okay but if you guys want to
see how I got this look then just keep
on watching and I hope you guys enjoy
the video okay so first I am going to
pry my skin and I'm taking this
covergirl trublend base business this is
a skin primer it is pore minimizing
yesterday I tried the illuminating one
but I just want to try basically all of
them so I'm gonna try this one it's
purple hmm I am going to take the true
blend matte mate foundation and this is
t70 I'm pretty sure that is the shade
that I settled on I actually filmed a
video yesterday basically just breaking
down everything about this foundation
and at the end of this video I'm
actually why not just do it now
I did a wear test with this foundation
and I'll go ahead and just insert a
little clip I'm gonna you know disappear
for a second and let you guys know my
thoughts on this foundation so here's
how I looked at ten in the morning when
I first applied it and then here is 12
hours later so as you can see I am
pretty oily around my nose which is
quite normal for me and aside from that
I feel like the rest of my face looks
fine so overall I would give this about
7 out of 10 because it doesn't look too
it's easy to touch up but at the same
time I did get pretty darn oily okay now
you know my thoughts I hate to have to
do it that way cuz I had a whole video
but then my audio was messed up I was so
mad but you guys know I like quality so
I could not put that up I couldn't do it
I'm gonna go ahead and take this
foundation and I'm gonna use this
Maybelline sponge just to blend it out
publish is the one if it's not I'll
finesse it but if it is I hope it is 60
it was t 60 it was hiding over there
okay so T 70 I remembered when I filmed
yesterday it was too dark so I settled
on teeth 60 I'm glad I caught that
because I know that people use me as a
shade reference so I would have hate it
if you went to the store and got T 70
and thought it was the right match when
really T 60 is a much better match for
me cuz t 7e was too dark as I'm sure you
guys could just see right now you guys
probably like and listen what the hell
were you about to do my bad there's a
lot of shades so granted it was a little
bit hard and confusing to keep up sorry
about that
next I'm gonna take it a little bit oh
gee and I'm gonna use the LA girl Pro
concealer and this is toffee I think I'm
a mix top being cool tan let me confirm
let me see oh yeah we're gonna mix in
some cool tan because I thought this
will highlight me but I guess I didn't
get his tan as I thought and to blend
this out I'm actually to take this
morphe sponge because I felt like the
maybelline sponge it was picking up too
much product which was kind of like
ruining the coverage of the foundation
so I'm gonna take this morphe sponge
it's still pretty affordable but you had
the Maybelline it was picking up some of
my foundation I didn't like that because
I felt like I had to layer I don't want
to be cakey
whenever you take too much concealer
like I just did don't try to work with
what you got just take your sponge and
just kind of like squeeze into a napkin
because it's gonna get rid of a lot of
that excess product so that way you're
able to blend and not basically have a
bunch of concealer on your face
let's see now that I dab the sponge off
I'll be able to just spread this product
instead of trying to spread too much
product and then to set I'm gonna take
my good old makeup revolution banana
powder
and then for the rest of my face I'm
gonna take the Maybelline fit me powder
and this is medium deep and we're just
gonna take my good old morphe 58 and
buff that into my skin and then after
all that powdering we're gonna go ahead
and just take this more besetting mist
just to give our face and nice spritz
just to kind of sink all that powder
into the skin because I don't like what
the battery next we're gonna do the
brows you guys probably thought that I'd
do the brows off-camera and that the
brows wouldn't be drugstore no the Euro
drugstore
I did one off-camera to make it easier
for me but I have to brow pencils that I
really like and I also insert a brow
pomade that is amazing
that's from BH Cosmetics I came and
talked from BH Cosmetics and the two
brow pencils are from NYX and BH and
they're both micro brow pencils so that
means they're really small so you're
able to get it really nice brow like
this so I'm gonna take a mixture of both
I don't really need to because they're
basically the same shade I just kind of
like taking different brow products
because I just feel like I don't know it
just does something different to my brow
personally but I'll just show you guys
how it looks with one and then I'm gonna
add other so I'm gonna take the BH
Cosmetics one and this is in the shade
brunette gonna just bully up these brows
and we are gonna fill them in
and then I'm going to switch over to the
next one I really need to because as you
can see it looks fine but since I did to
the sprout I want to go ahead and just
make sure that I'm doing to the other
brows well so that they're even okay so
now I'm going to clean up my brows using
the pro concealer and cool tan okay
brows are just about done so now I'm
gonna take your remaining cool tan
that's on the back of my hand just to
prime my eyes for eye shadow I'm gonna
take this amazing eye shadow palette
that I discovered at target a live
target and this is by wetting mild it is
only five dollars and I just feel like
if you are someone who doesn't do a lot
of like experimenting with eye shadow
and you just simply want something that
you could pick up every single day and
just do a look this is the palette for
you it is so pigmented it is it has
every single shade that you would need
for everyday look and even like a
glammed up night look as well I just
love it as you can see I am like so here
for it you got my approval for this
palette I love it so much this is not
sponsored I picked out the target I'm
gonna pick it up or open it and this is
called rosy in the air and I'm gonna use
this lash out today I'm going to take
this transition shade right here first
and apply this in my crease
see how it's just the perfect crease
color I don't love it so much I'm so
excited about this palette I love it
like if I can pick up any palette right
now that I could only use for the rest
of the month it will be this palette so
serious I'm gonna take this shade right
here just to add some warmth see that
beautiful
and I'm also going to pop those two
shades on the bottom part of my eye as
well and then I'm going to apply this
transition shade right on my lid and
then for mascara I'm going to take
Maybelline lash sensational mascara
because honestly one of my favorite
drugstore mascaras because no shade
high-end brands but I find that this
doesn't get under my eye where some of
my high-end mascaras at the end the day
I have little black spots because it's
transferred this doesn't do that to me
so I trusted with my heart and we're
gonna put a light layer because we're
action in upon falsies very light layer
it could definitely get more like boom
than this but light layer
For Lashes I'm going to take the ardell
demi whispies and honestly I feel like
they're just one of those lashes that
they look good I'm just about anyone
some eyes they definitely probably look
a little more natural but since my dad's
hoodie I feel like it gives just enough
valium but not too much to overpower my
eye and it looked pretty darn natural I
think so what do you guys think I like
them and I just I don't know I feel like
overall if I could recommend a lash
that's affordable it'll definitely be
any lash in the Ardell line but
definitely a wispy or a demi wispy
next to bronze up my face
I do love my morphe highlighting contour
kit but if you want something a little
bit cheaper and just you can just run to
Target and get I'm gonna take the Black
Radiance soft focus finishing powder and
this in the shade milk chocolate and
then for blush I'm taking this wet and
wild blush and this is color icon and
this is mellow wine and this is a morphe
59 brush
for highlight I'm going to take a little
bit of the Maybelline master chrome
highlighter and this is molten rose gold
and then I'm going to apply my ELF daily
hydration moisturizer all over where I
want my face to just have a more of a
glow because that's just what I like to
do because if I don't highlight too much
with actual highlight I still like my
skin to have a radiance to it so I'm
just gonna take my sponge and just kind
of go over my cheeks that's my little
trick whenever I don't put too much
highlight I do a little bit of this and
it gives me the glow that I want in my
skin without too much highlight we're
going to set our entire face with some
more be setting mist and then for lips
I'm gonna first take this NYX lip liner
and this is downtown beauty and then
right in the center I try to take
another color but I didn't like it so I
had to redo it I'm gonna take this
Milani amore shine liquid lip color and
this is foxy sexy number four
and then because I enjoy my brows with a
little more warmth I'm gonna take this
palette again and I'm taking this
transition shade on a more feet in 515
and I'm just gonna sweep this across my
brow just add a little bit of warmth
without doing too much
now you can keep the look like this I
sure but honestly I've done this ice so
many times before it's literally so
basic it's so simple so if you want to
add just a little bit of pop as you can
see I added a yellow but it's not too
overwhelming it's just that subtle like
ooh that's cute that's cute for everyday
so I am going to first take this l'oreal
infallible paints and this one is 312
Jet Set blonde and I'm gonna take this
yellow right here and pop some on the
back of my hand and I'm gonna take this
morphe Y 18 and I am just going to
slowly apply it to the inner part of the
eye you don't want to take too much
because you could make a mess you want
to start with a thin layer and just kind
of gradually build that pigmentation and
then we're gonna take one of my favorite
affordable palettes I'm not sure if I've
showed you here much help but I use it
on my day-to-day this is by BH Cosmetics
it's their glam reflection gilded 15
color eyeshadow palette and it has one
of the best yellows I've ever used this
is also a great palette if you just want
something to use every day I'm gonna
take this yellow right here same brush
and just pack it on top
okay so now you have a good old nice
everyday look with just a pop of color
just to add some liveliness to the look
like yellow is just such a beautiful
color on the eyes and it just really
goes with the overall warmth of the look
so here you have it I just did a little
look using some of my favorite
affordable products I hope you guys
enjoyed it and I hope that you guys pick
up some of these products and like them
and love them as well and let me know
your thoughts if you do happen to pick
some of them up or if you use some of
them already but other than that thank
