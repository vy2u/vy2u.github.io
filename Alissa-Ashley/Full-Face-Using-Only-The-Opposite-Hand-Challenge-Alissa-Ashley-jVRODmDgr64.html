you cannot tell by the title this video
today's video is going to be a challenge
because I just want to do something that
was more fun and not so serious because
I do not feel like even like slaying all
that hard I hope I slayed with this
challenge but I won't feel like doing
anything serious so imma go ahead and do
a challenge and this challenge was done
by a naked tutorials a couple days ago
and it was also done by a couple other
youtubers I've been seeing float around
I looked it up and I just watch
everyone's videos I was like I think
could do this so it's gonna be the
challenge where you do your full face
using your non-dominant hand which for
me is my right hand
team lefty through a lefty comment down
below I feel like we're so rare and
we're awesome but I'm gonna use my right
hand to do everything so I'm like scared
as hell but we're gonna try it today so
if you want to see me do this then just
keep on watching okay so to make this a
little more interesting for myself you
know I'm gonna take well this is like
the only kind of rope that I had for my
robe and I'm gonna I don't know how to
do this I'm gonna basically tie my left
hand to the back of my chair so that I
don't even like it's basically like I'm
like stuck with the right hand like I
have to use the right hand I mean I know
that I have to use it but I feel like
just on impulse I'm gonna be like oh so
I'm gonna tie this up pulls that so I'm
tying it 50 shades myself
oh god this is scary how hard is it
tired not olicity nice oh my god oh my
god I don't like this I don't like this

just right hand today so well I should
have got my products ready but the first
time I do jumbles where is everything
mmm okay okay okay like what I not get
stuff repaired okay so the first thing
to do is take my NARS all day luminous

don't have a standing mirror so I'm kind
of seeing my monitor but like it's not
always hella accurate so we're just
gonna hope that I do good oh this hurts
this hurts oh my god as I like
it hurts to use his hand because it's
exercising and it does not exercise to
do my makeup oh my god I'm so dramatic

key kind of medium key I don't know we
look blended where's my mirror we're
pretty easily blended we're gone
