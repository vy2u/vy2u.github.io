today's video is going to be my everyday
go to makeup routine this is the look
that I do you know when I'm not going
anywhere super glamorous so you know a
smoky eye isn't necessary but I still
want to know look kind of dolled up so
you'd like to see our Chi this look just
keep on watching also don't forget to
subscribe and check that description bar
for all details now let's get started
the first thing I always like to do
every single day is just clean my skin
I'm including this one because I just
want to remind you guys to exfoliate and
clean your skin every day but also I was
actually getting ready to go out so you
guys just get to see it all so I'm going
to cleanse my skin with my ultimate skin
spa system and my purity soap and I'm
going to moisturize my Cetaphil lotion I
always expect a more complicated name
ascetical names so simple now I'm going
to take my Marc Jacobs primer and
honestly my primer it varies it just all
depends on when I'm feeling like and
when my skin is kind of you know telling
me to put on it and I feel like my
skin's been a little bit dry so that's
why I chose that primer now I'm taking
my cover of X natural finish foundation
this stuff is the freakin bomb oh I love
this foundation and I'm just going to
blend it out with a Beauty Blender did I
mention that I love this foundation cuz
I do it is a natural finish now I'm
going to take my bare minerals bare skin
concealer and I also love this concealer
I feel like these two pair well together
because they're both nice and not
necessarily dewy but they're more skin
like than other concealers and
foundations that I have so when I go for
everyday look I try to you know get
something that looks like my skin you
know not anything too crazy and now to
work on setting I'm going to take my Ben
Nye banana powder and I'm just going to
place that on my highlighted areas for
everyday looks I typically don't you
know do you know the contouring any more
the cream contouring I just stick to
powders glad I feel like you know it
just looks a little bit more soft and
when I cream contour I put powder
contour on top of it it can look a
little bit more dramatic and I you know
don't want to go for anything dramatic
for everyday look so that's why I'm not
you know doing any cream contouring and
I'm just going to dust away that powder
and I'm going to place that powder on
other areas as well just a second
now this next step isn't super necessary
but I do like a good under-eye highlight
so I'm just going to place a little bit
more powder on my eyes and it's kind of
making but kind of not because it's only
going to be under there for about two
minutes or not even that and then I'm
going to begin contouring as you can see
I placed my contour a little bit too
wide so I'm going to place some more
banana power underneath it to act as my
guideline and I thought that's a great
tip for anyone who doesn't know where to
contour
yeah just make some little lines and I'm
going to be using my Too Faced dark
chocolate Soleil powder to bronze up and
contour and now I'm just going to dust
away the excess powder as you can see
I'm kind of going in a circular motion
and the reason I do this is because by
getting some of that powder on my
contoured areas it's going to lighten it
and it's going to make my contour softer
for my everyday look and then for my
nose I don't do any extreme contouring
but I do define it just by going back
and forth and a little motion and that
just instantly defines the nose without
you know the struggle of getting a bomb
nose contour and now for blush I'm
taking NARS Taj Mahal it's a nice you
know not shimmery but you know very
shiny type of orange blush and I think
it just kind of it's been my thing
lately I love orange blush and now we're
going to move into brows I'm going to be
using my benefit browsing which is my
favorite brow product and this in the
shade dark and I feel like typically for
people you know what their everyday
looks they try to keep their brows you
know nice and natural I on the other
hand while my brows be bold as if and I
just like a bold brow especially when my
eyes aren't done up I feel like my brows
they just have to dominate and they have
to slay so I'm going to fill these in
quite fiercely let's just say that
after the niacin filled and I'm just
going to clean up my brows I feel like
this step is quite important to me
because I just like the way it looks and
that's just my preference and I love a
nice little brow highlight and then
afterwards I'm just going to you know
smoothing out my lid space and then I'm
going to apply more concealer on top of
the entire eye I'm essentially priming
the eye but as opposed to you know going
in with eye shadow I'm going to leave a
completely blank so I'm doing the same
step that I do you know when I you know
I'm about to put on eyeshadow I'm like
applying the eyeshadow does that make
sense I hope so I hope so
and the next I'm going to highlight I
don't care what kind of day it is I have
to have my highlight on I'm pretty sure
you guys know this and I'm going to be
using my honest hacia peach nectar and
as you can see I sprayed it with fix+
and the reason I did that is because I
feel like it just kind of brings out a
sheen in it that really sits well on my
skin it's so hard to explain I plan on
doing a video on highlights so I will
explain it then
so I won't get so tongue-tied now so I'm
just gonna hide the areas I normally
highlight and before moving into mascara
and anything else I to just set my face
and the reason I do this is because if I
set my face after my mascara it is going
to give ruined I've done it so many
times before and I will get pissed off
and throw tantrums so to avoid that I
like to set my face and then apply my
layers of mascara and honestly that is
literally audu to my eyes I just add a
bunch of mascara and I feel like this
enhances it
you know enough enough
and then for whatever reason I can't
find the freaking clip where I you know
had my little flappy folds but I did
hide those guys like that's also
important as well and just really really
adds you know some kind of flavor to my
eye and then I highlight my brow bone as
well so yeah I'm sorry about that I
don't know where the hell the clip went
it ran away it ran away but now for the
lips I'm going to line that with my kiss
New York roasted coffee nothing new and
I'm going to take this gloss from honest
hacia I don't know the name by heart but
I will you know try to find it for you
guys the sticker freaking came off
though but it's just a nice kind of
clear gloss with the orange tint and
then after that here is my finished
routine and honestly everyone's routine
is different some people may think
that's a lot of steps lissa but let's
add some a lot of time on her hands
because this is all i do i make videos
for you guys so i have a lot of time to
get ready but if you guys want to see a
quicker routine for those who don't have
as much time let me know and I'll pop it
out for you guys other than that thank
you so much for watching and I'll see
you guys soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
