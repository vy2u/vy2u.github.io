ready with me slash soft pink look and
here's how it looks
I look so strange with hair I'm still
getting used to it it's kind of hard
look at myself this way but um yeah this
is what I'll be filming for you guys
today first I'm gonna start with dusty
rose by Anastacio using my Luxy brush
from my 12 piece set and I'm going to be
applying
birkin as well as well as beauty mark
it's just a mixture of all three of
these colors honestly they're on like
the same kind of category I used beauty
marks it's a darker purple and the other
colors to kind of smoke it out to make
it pink I also used a luck see Beauty
pink shade but I can remember at the top
of my head but it will be in the
description box I'm a scratch my ear and
then I'm gonna take Mac soft ochre Paint
Pot and just carve out my little crease
area someone said I do the same kind of
looks all the time and it kind of my
feelings because you know I'm doing what
works for me you know like I don't have
a lot of eye space I have to I have to
work with what makes me look good okay
like yeah I mean I can get adventurous
sometimes but you know I'm comfortable
so that's what I'm doing and on top of
the soft ochre I'm gonna apply birkin
which is actually a light pink but it
appears to look darker on top of the
soft ochre and I'm gonna apply beauty
mark just to kinda make it a little bit
neater and then I'm using honest osseous
cream color this is the black one just
to make a little small baby wing I tried
something different today I never do
wings and as you can see this looks
really simple after I apply my little
wing from the baby wing I'm gonna be
applying
House of lashes iconic lashes after it's
coming right there I'm gonna applying
those I have a lot of lashes but I
always a conflict over which ones to
wear if I decide to coat these ones and
then I'm going to be mixing the NARS all
day luminous foundation as well as the
Gerard cosmetics BB illumination demian
eyes glow and I'm applying it to my face
with a Beautyblender Beautyblender Pro
I've been breaking out a lot recently
but yeah we're just um cover all that up
and we're ignoring I'm breaking out so
yeah got a nice little layer of it I
didn't put a lot on I don't really like
wearing a lot of foundation and then I'm
going to take this Mac a little
concealed it's not quad it's whatever
six is and I'm gonna take the orange
shape just to kind of cover up some of
my dark spots and I'm gonna take the
NARS foundation on top of that and while
blending out first and then you can see
I'm taking the NARS foundation and put
it on top
next to me taking the Kevin Kwan sensual
skin enhancer this is number eight to
highlight and blend that with the beauty
burner the beauty blender Pro I don't
know why it's so hard for me to say that
and I apply it with the Luxy brush from
my 12 piece set I'm gonna highlight my
forehead you know could we have a good
for it highlight otherwise it look
really weird and I mean they come just
blend out with the little small brush
just cuz I don't want to mess it up with
the Beauty winner pluck yeah Beauty
Blender Pro I can't say that and I'm
gonna take this cinema secrets
foundation palette yeah I'm gonna take
that shade I point out to contour I love
using this contour on I feel like a
amazing shade it's very smooth and it's
just easy it's really easy and I'm all
about easy and as you can see I took a
darker shade kind of just create like
dimension even though I noticed that
when I contour with creams
I usually um not so much on the forehead
but on my cheekbones I usually blend it
out a lot so it's almost non-existent
but then I you know of course go in with
a powder and intensify it I don't really
like having like a super-duper harsh
Korean contour because I don't know it
just doesn't it doesn't really look
right on me so I kind of just blend it
up very well you can see in a minute
here it looks like it's barely anything
there and I'm gonna set my under eye
with Ben Nye banana powder which is my
favorite I'm gonna set my forehead with
that as well at first I used to mix the
Laura Mercier translucent loose powder
and this but I just find that makes my
under eye like a little bit cakey and
this is here's the one fall out this way
so now I only put the Laura Mercier what
I'm doing now on the rest of my face
with the large fluffy brush by lexi and
then let me finish this I'm talking
ahead of what I'm doing after that I'm
going to go with the same brush and take
Mac mineralize skinfinish and dark deep
and I'm going to be
not necessarily contouring but just kind
of adding color to my face I didn't want
a harsh contour sharp contour so I just
kind of fluffed it around which is why I
use this fluffy brush and this is my
favorite thing to bronze up with at the
moment and then I'll be taking max
Lovejoy blush and just popping that on
my little cheeks or they're not little
that's you've gotten bigger but what
else where you ignore that I'm just
gonna flip it on it looks Pinker on
camera but it's not that it's not that
pigmented and then be taking Lancome lip
pencil on a Mendell just clear that I
can't find my other purple pencil and
I'm gonna be taking dusty rose on top of
that just smoke it out so it can kind of
match the top part of the eye obviously
and then moving on to the lips I'm going
to blank out the color with the leftover
product of my Beauty Blender Pro was it
right that time and I'm going to be
taking max plum lip liner just in line I
usually use the cork
this is this lip passes this look is
more pink I want you to plum and then
I'll be taking honest osseous liquid
lippy in a pure Hollywood well just my
favorite and I'm gonna mix that together
just to create a nice pinky lip
I love purely what it goes with glitter
everything thing it's crazy it's
definitely a staple
and then i'm going to be applying laura
geller gilded honey highlight Thank You
amaura for putting me on and exposed me
to this bomb-ass highlight because
that's exactly what it is and it's just
very smooth I think that's why I like it
better Wow like it's not too harsh by
the same time you get a nice nice
highlight going on my nose this is a
more piece and brush and then to finish
it I'm going to spray in my face with
NYX dewy finishing spray and that is the
completed look
yeah then I put on my wig of course I'll
do another video specifically for this
wig at the time I'm a little bit like it
I need to get used to at first before I
you know should you guys be putting it
on because I personally you know still
struggle putting it on because I I'm not
used to it but I definitely will please
let me know if that's something you guys
really really want and I'll try to get
done this as possible and it's from
while African it says Sierra inspired
wig it's gorgeous
