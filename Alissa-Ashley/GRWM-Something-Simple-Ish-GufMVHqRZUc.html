video is going to be a little get ready
with me and this video is sponsored by
QVC I did receive compensation to create
this video they send me a bunch of new
products to review for you guys and some
of these products for once as you guys
would probably recognize because I
already use them in some of my videos
and QVC just launched a beauty IQ is a
new multi-platform social shopping
experience so they offer a bunch of
different brands so I'll be showing you
guys some of those brands today as you
can see I already went ahead and applied
my cucumber gel mask by Peter Thomas
Roth and then I had to open a bathroom
because Mountain craves so much
attention and stigmas will Palmer the
door just being crazy Mountain next I
just went ahead and hop in the shower
going to rinse my face and also clean it
with my purity one-step facial cleanser
and if that sounds familiar to you it's
because you've been here for a while you
know that I've talked about this before
those awesome seeing a product in a
brand I'm familiar with on Beauty iq.com
imma go ahead and take more philosophy
that's their amazing grace shower gel
and I'm just cleaning myself and then
afterwards I go ahead and hop out of the
shower and moisturize using the first
day Beauty ultra Repair Cream and this
was super bomb I have dry skin so this
just yes it feels great because very
hydrating and I'm also taking me josie
maran whipped argan oil to moisturize my
body and this smells amazing
I'm gonna go ahead just yet get my whole
body needs to and then to move into
makeup
I'm taking this Molly Beauty flawless
finish transforming effects foundation
and as you can see it looks very
skin-like and nice and radiant I'm gonna
go ahead and buff this into my skin I
was very excited about this and I'm
taking my heart-shaped tape concealer
and yet you guys are know you guys
already know I love shape tape so it was
really awesome if they had just on this
site as well and I'm just setting
everything with my by by post pressed
powder and if you notice I changed a
little logo to a red bow and every
single item that you see with that
little bow means that it came from my
Beauty IQ advent calendar so and with
the regular QVC logo that means that you
can find on
you see these all brands are on qvc.com
now go ahead and just fill in my brows I
decide to go for a nice national brow
well I Drive and then we go ahead and
just apply my I use in the shape tape
and then I'm taking this hard to five
piece tardies collector set to create a
very simple eye look I went for
something very natural today because I
didn't want to overdo it wanted to do
something nice and soft and beautiful
after I finished my eye shadow go ahead
and pop on some mascara from Molly
Beauty and one thing that I liked about
Beauty IQ was said to introduce me to
brands that I had never used before so I
was able to check out other brands that
I do not know of and also they offer
tutorials so if you want to see some of
these products in action you're able to
feed them so pretty cool and they offer
live programming so it's pretty awesome
to see everything live next time I go
ahead and apply my lord Geller gilded
honey
yes they have to go to honey so anything
that has go to honey is cool with me and
I'm gonna go ahead and take me in
cosmetics naturally pre essentials
palette just to add a little bit of brow
bone highlight I'll pop on my lip color
this is bare minerals Gen nude liquid
lip color then I go ahead and put on my
clothes and I'm also going to pause them
for a few this is the nest midnight lure
all-day perfume and then I'm ready for
my day
okay so now I'm back home and I couldn't
record everything in my day because it
was just physically impossible but I got
the food so it looks good right after
that long day imma go ahead and wash off
my makeup and this is my first time
using a makeup remover towel and I was
like oh should should because it worked
so cool I had never used before and I've
always seen can we use them and I'm just
like it's got to be like like I don't
know like I didn't believe it but yeah
it works and it's pretty handy when
you're feeling lazy and don't feel like
actually using soap and all that it's
pretty cool so yeah go ahead and moist
on my face moisturize my lips play on my
onesie because I love onesie they keep
me so warm and I just love them and i'ma
go ahead and take care of my cats
because they're my life and literally
since getting cats they just fill my day
up with a lot more than what they would
be filled up with because I don't yeah
below there what grade you got lady so I
just give them some love and I hop my
computer and usually on my computer they
just bother me anyway because they just
love me and I looked in it's okay even
though they're annoying blech I hop on
BB IQ and they offered live programming
five nights a week Wednesday through
Sunday 8 p.m. to midnight Eastern Time
and as you can see I can't even enjoy
that because mountains being bad but
yeah they're just sort of crazy and if
you have cats you know so usually I'm
only able to stand my computer for about
maybe 15 20 minutes in fact without any
disturbances and then I get off and
usually I get came out of brushing just
to help with shedding every every other
day he loves it and it's teamwork
you know we help each other and he licks
and I just brush and I go and check on
mark and my little baby and you can see
I'm really like a crazy cat lady now you
guys
it's crazy like I just did I'm obsessed
I have a cat Instagram like that's how
official I am and you think that after
all that pampering they'd like to sleep
and know they'd come my room and they
bother me but I just lay around on the
floor my aunt and we just talked and I
just can't talk about all their life
advice and needs and then usually their
bed and they're running around so once
I'm ready to finally go to bed I kick
them out and then I just try to go to
sleep but you know they're so bad out
there but that is it for my little day
routine to the gate for today or
technically tonight nighttime right now
