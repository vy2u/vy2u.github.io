hey guys welcome back to my channel
today's video is going to be a flapper
girl Halloween tutorial this is the
first Halloween tutorial that ever made
so I'm very very excited about this and
I'll be popping out a lot of these for
this month and the first thing I'm going
to do is just highlight the high points
of my face using the Benefit Cosmetics
Watts up highlight also I do not film
the hair portion of this video I tried
I freaking tried but it is hard
so once I've mastered I'll make a
separate video for that but yeah I'm not
about that life it was so freaking
harder to be like 10 times to do it
anyhoo right now as you can see I am
just color correcting and just covering
all my dark spots with the kett
cosmetics cream makeup and I'm doing
this because I noticed that a lot of
flapper girls they had nice perfect
flawless porcelain skin so I'm gonna try
to cover up as many imperfections as I
possibly can
so that I can look flawless like them
and then next I'm going to take my
makeup forever
Ultra HD foundation I'm just going to
stipple that onto my skin I'm not really
rubbing it in I'm just kind of patting
it on and I took very very little
foundation because I didn't wanna look
too cakey for this look and yes I'm just
going to place it all over and then I'm
going to take my honest hacia concealer
I mixed it with a deeper shade of a
concealer so would it be too highlighted
because I noticed that they didn't
really have a lot of you know
highlighting contouring going on they
had just a lot of blush and you know
nice smooth skin so I didn't want to
over highlight it was so hard for me not
to and since it was hard for me not to I
decided to just apply a little bit of a
lighter concealer on my that cheek area
my little high point area just to add
that as my little highlight so I can be
satisfied with myself now since we
aren't contouring I still want to have
somewhat defined kind of cheekbones so
I'm gonna place that concealer
underneath why I would normally place my
contour and just blend it out and as you
can see it creates the illusion of a
contour without adding a deeper shape to
our cheeks because we want to preserve
those cheeks for a lot of blush
and now to add some rosiness to our
cheeks I'm going to take the Ella Girl
cosmetics pelvic contour stick and I'm
just going to blend that into the skin
we are gonna go over our cheeks with a
powder blush at in the video but yes I
want to have a nice base for that blush
and then I'm just going to place some
Buttercup powder by Sacha cosmetics
underneath my eye as well as all over my
face but I'm going to allow it to sit
under my eye so that all the black
eyeshadow I'll be using will not drop on
to all of my flawless work
before beginning the I shot I want to
lay down my brows with Elmer's glue
stick and then after I lay them down and
the glue is dry I'm going to take the
Ultra HD foundation stick and just
really work that into all the hairs to
try to make it look as invisible as
possible and then I'm just going to take
down that foundation stick on my eye
just because I'm in that area I'm going
to blend it out and I'm going to set it
with Sasha Buttercup powder and then now
for the brows I'm going to take the
Anastacio chocolate dip brow and I am
going to create a neat brow at the same
time not too neat that makes any sense
it's going to be somewhat blocky but at
the same time it's not going to be all
perfect and flawless because I noticed
that a lot of their brows were not that
so I kind of wanted to make it look
natural at the same time as unnatural as
possible if that makes any sense at all
and then I'm going to just take soft
peach by anastasiya and place on all of
the eye and now I'm taking sienna and
hot chocolate and just working on the
shape it is always better to go on with
these shadows first which are a lighter
shade than the black and create your
shape first and then go into the black
and then go on top of that and doing
this will make it blend so much more
easy and you will be less likely to mess
up because if you do the black first
then so many things can go wrong so I'm
just taking the black and I was really
working it up into the inner brow parts
and I'm taking a bunch of different
blending brushes and just going back and
forth with all three of those shades
until I am satisfied with how it comes
out and now for the lid I'm going to
take the LOL cosmetics black gel flight
liner and place that all over and then
on top of that I'm just going to pack on
the new or eyeshadow from anastacio on
top and then I'm just going to make sure
everything is nice and blended together
so it doesn't look like two separate
things going on on the crease and the
lid
and then for the under eye I'm going to
place that gel liner very very close to
the waterline but not in the actual
waterline and I'm just going to smoke it
out very very lightly and I'm going
through that with the black eyeshadow as
well and then in the waterline I'm going
to place a white pencil and on top of
that I placed a pearlized pencil so it
wasn't too white and I'm just going to
apply some mascara before taking my
lashes and these bottom lashes which are
gorgeous are from Southern Southern
Beauty lashes and these style lina when
they first sent me them I'm just like I
don't know how I'm gonna wear these and
I'm glad I didn't lose them or like you
know abandon them because they came in
handy for this look for sure and I'm
taking my top lashes and they're in this
style Bella by new bounce some and then
I'm going to just highlight my brow bone
as well as those inner little flaps of
my eye and now for the lips I'm just
going to mute out my lip shape and color
set that with some powder and then I'm
going to take that same gel eyeliner
that I used on my eyes so sorry that my
mirror is covering it and I'm going to
create a nice little lip shape the
reason for me muting my lip shade and
shape is because I want to create a nice
kind of pointy Cupid's bow and I really
want to have control over that so muting
them allowed me to really focus as
opposed to getting distracted by my
natural Cupid's bow and yes I'm just
going to fill that in very very thickly
and then I'm going to move on to
lipstick and for the lipstick shade I
chose this nice berry red shade and I
chose this because I noticed that a lot
of them had you know red lips with a
black liner around the lips and also
knows that the lips weren't extremely
blended at the same time they were
slightly blended but definitely not as
blended as how we do it in our time so
yes I'm just going to really really work
on the lip and make it look as 20s as
possible and then I'm just going to
sharpen it up a little bit because I
noticed that though it wasn't super
blended it was pretty sharp so yeah I
want my Cupid's bow to be
redefined and in the last step for our
look is to add blush you do not want to
miss this step because a lot of flapper
girls had nice really really rosy cheeks
so yeah this is definitely my favorite
part just really applying a lot of blush
because you guys haven't noticed I'm not
really a blush girl but yeah this
definitely might have changed my mind
and after that this will be the finished
look and the costume that I have is from
adore me.com they are a lingerie sight
but they do have Halloween costumes in
right now and it came with this nice
dress it's tops about right before the
knee it came with these pearls as well
as this headpiece and a thong so if
you're going out with your boyfriend you
guys could get a little naughty after
that Halloween party if you have a few
drinks but other than that I was totally
kidding by the way over that we hope you
guys enjoyed this tutorial I cannot wait
to show you what I have coming up in my
little Halloween series and if you have
any suggestions on what you would like
to see do not hesitate to comment
because I'm making videos for you guys
other than that thank you so much for
watching and I'll see you guys very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
