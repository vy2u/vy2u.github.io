show you how to achieve the ultimate
glow and I paired it with this nice kind
of sultry sexy eye look with nice
fluttery lashes in a nude lip you guys
gave me a lot of good feedback on my
selfies for this look on Instagram so
I'm hoping you enjoyed the tutorial if
you want to see how I achieve it then
just keep on watching the first thing
I'm going to do is take Girl Meets pearl
and this is by Benefit Cosmetics and
what this is basically going to do and
what it is it's an illuminating primer
and you can wear it without makeup or
with but I'm going to use it as my base
so I have a nice illuminating base to
start and now I'm just going to color
correct a little bit with kett cosmetics
cream makeup just to get rid of some of
the darkness and the reason I'm color
correcting is because for my foundation
I'm using the same one I've been using
which is the Maybelline fit me dewy but
I'm going to use a Beauty Blender to
apply it and I'm going to really work on
blending that deeply into my skin so I
can get a nice coverage but not too
cakey
so that Girl Meets pearl really really
shines through and then afterwards I'm
going to take my honest hacia concealer
and I'm going to apply it as usual
underneath my eye as well as my forehead
and then I'm going to blend that out
and then I'm going to take my 3d face
creator I get Ruby kisses and kiss
Newark confused but it will be in my
description bar and I'm just going to
apply that to my forehead because I like
to always make sure to contour my
forehead because it's so big and then
I'm going to take that on the other
areas where I contour and I'm just going
to blend that out per usual and now for
blush I'm going to take Benefit
Cosmetics lolli tint and I'm just going
to apply that on my cheeks and I'm going
to blend that in with both my finger and
the sponge as you can see I'm barely you
know dabbing that Beauty Blender onto my
cheek I am doing it so lightly because I
don't want to interrupt the cream
concealer too much otherwise it will get
messed up if I do it too harsh because
this is a liquid blush and then I'm
going to work on setting my under eye
and I'm taking the Sasha Buttercup
powder and Laura Mercier mixed you guys
should know this because it's what I've
been doing lately and I'm going to use a
damp sponge to apply that and the reason
I'm using a damp sponge is because it
absorbs more when I use a damp sponge so
that way it's not too much powder
underneath my eye I got a little brain
fart there didn't know I was going with
that and I'm just going to set the rest
of my face where I need it with that
same powder so that's around my lip area
or my mouth area because you know we're
going to be talking all day we don't
want you know little creases and I'm
going to set my forehead and my nose and
underneath where I put my contour
and now I'm just going to further
contour using the benefit hoola bronzer
and I would say this is more so a
contour shade because of its cool tone
factor so I'm not going to get much
warmth from it but I am going to get
nice chiseled cheekbones so I'm just
going to apply that on the areas where I
would normally contour and then I'm just
going to apply a little bit of blush
this is NARS liberté it's a nice pinky
coral blush and I'm going to work on
highlighting and to start I'm going to
take Watts up highlighter benefit and I
warmed up on my finger first and now I'm
just going to dab it into the skin I
like to get the most concentrated
product right on that Center and then I
blend out the edges into the other areas
around that center part if that makes
any sense at all but you really want to
make sure it's blended so there's no
harsh lines and I'm going to do the same
for my nose and I'm going to apply it on
my Cupid's bow area as well and with
this product it's best to use your
fingers and not a sponge because it is a
cream product and since you're placing
on top of powder you're going to want to
blend that baby in really really really
good
and then next I'm going to take a
sunbeam which is a nice golden liquid
illuminator also by benefit and I'm
going to place that on the edges of my
forehead or whatever that area is near
the temple and I'm doing this because
once my face hits the Sun it should be
like BAM it's gonna be like girl where
are you going
are you going home to the Sun yes you
are so I'm gonna fly that right there
and then to really set that highlight in
place and set it off I'm going to take
laura geller gilded honey and pack that
on top and as you can see I'm glowing
and I'm ready to shine and I'm going to
apply that on the other areas where I
applied the Watts up and then we're
gonna jump into the eye for times sake I
went ahead and did my brows as well as
one eye off camera and now I'm just
going to go ahead and pry my eye using
these shiny cosmetics eye and lip primer
and then for eye shadow I use the Too
Faced bonbon palette it is not yet
released but if you guys do want to see
a more in depth tutorial using them or
swatches or anything like that please
let me know and I'll do it but I'm doing
my same method where I take the lighter
color first as my transition and then
build up with the dark shade I only use
two eyeshadows for this and now I'm
going to take Benefit Cosmetics they're
real push-up liner and I'm using a brown
liner as opposed to black because I feel
like that's what makes a little bit more
sultry I don't want smoky so that's why
I didn't use too dark of eyeshadows I
want it sultry so I wanted to be nice
and sexy but just not overwhelmingly
bold if that makes any sense at all hope
it does I'm always acting if something
makes sense and now I'm just going to
soften up that wing by smoking it out
just a little bit using that same
eyeshadow I'm going to place that all
over my crease or where I am applying
it's hard to explain what I'm doing but
as you can see I'm just dragging it
across my crease and then I'm going to
fluff that out so I have no harsh lines
and then for the under eye I'm going to
take a brown eye pencil this one is from
NYX and I'm just going to place that
right underneath but not bring it all
the way in and I'm just going to smudge
that out using that same eyeshadow that
I use to smudge the upper high and then
after I have that done I'm going to take
my Mac mixing medium liner and I'm going
to take this pigment by Inglot it's a
number and I don't have a top of my head
because I have a horrible memory but it
will be in the description bar and I'm
going to Pat that on my lid as well as
underneath right in that inner corner
just get some nice kind of glowing to
our eyes to kind of match our glowing
skin and then I'm going to take benefits
they're real mascara and I'm going to
apply that on my top and bottom lashes
I'm going to make sure to really get
them in on that bottom lash because I
want my bottom lashes to be able to keep
up with the fluffy and you know kind of
bold lashes I'll be placing on top and
these ones are from new bounds some and
they're in the style Bella which are my
faves and these are the eyes done nice
and sexy and now we're going to complete
the look by applying our lift color and
I decide to use Ruby kisses or kiss New
York it's kiss New York roasted coffee
lip pencil which has been my favorite
and I'm going to apply milk cosmetics
nude lipstick on top of that which is a
really poppin nude pink lipstick and
then on top of that I'm going to apply
Mac's dead nude lip gloss and it's
basically just a skin tone gloss but
it's just more on the nude side so it's
kind of exactly what it sounds like and
I'm going to make sure that they're all
nice and blended so I'm going to take
that lip liner again just to kind of
blend it in more and then after the lips
are done we're going to just go ahead
and set our face using mac fix+ and I'm
going to drench myself in this because
it really allows the highlight and all
the luminaries we applied settle into
the skin very nicely and that's how we
get that nice radiant glow and then
after that we'll have the finished look
I really really hope you guys like this
