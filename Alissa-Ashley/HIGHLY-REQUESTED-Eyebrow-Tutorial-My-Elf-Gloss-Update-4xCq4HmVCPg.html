never be Brooke Shields but I have brow
products to make me feel the Brooke
Shields oh my god I like Sunday's where
else do you though but like her the real
hood I could dream
hey guys welcome back to my channel so
today's video is going to be a long
awaited highly requested brow tutorial
and a lot of you guys have been loving
happened do my brows and I'm like me - I
like the - so I want to go ahead and
show you guys how I achieve these
bad-boy brows in you I like my brows and
I did a video for you guys and also as
you guys can tell I have a huge
announcement for you guys my lip gloss
what else is coming back I know you guys
have been like dying to get your hands
on it because it's sold out so fast and
you guys like Alyssa
when is this gloss coming back I have
been getting so many comments and I'm
like oh my god what oh so bad it's
coming back but you guys know I can't
really like give you guys too much
information on the launch date but now I
can here it is it is coming back on the
23rd so be ready be prepared because of
price sellout again I hope that's
amazing but it is coming back so I just
want to tell you guys that and in this
video I use it to top off my look so if
you guys want to see how you my brows
and all that good stuff then just keep
on watching and I hope you guys enjoy it
sirens hope you guys enjoy my brows yeah
hello that's not my tour Tina from get
out get out
anyways I'm good let's start over I'm
gonna take the elf brow gel and I like
this because as you can see the
applicator is very nice and small and my
hairs are very small so it just works
perfectly for my brow hairs and I'm
using this specific gel because it's
very nice and lightweight just to simply
grew my brows in place and then to hold
them I'm going to take the Ben Nye
prosthetic adhesive
a blinks fully and this is like my new
little brow check that been doing and I
am just going to use this and apply a
thin layer you do not want to apply too
much otherwise your brows will be hard
as a rock and this does remove very
easily if you in case you're wondering
like what the hell doesn't this is
prosthetic adhesive you know this works
perfectly as a nice brow gel
I just it's changed my brow game
completely and after applying that I'm
gonna take my eco brow in the shade
Reeta you guys have seen me use this so
much it's like one of my favorite brow
products ever to exist and I love it
mainly because it's so hard to find a
brow product that has a color that I
like because either too warm or too cool
toned and this one just seems to get it
right every single time and they have a
wide range of brow colors and I really
like it and you can keep the brow like
this if you're more on the natural side
you know nice and cute but I'm gonna
continue to build the brow by doing a
hair like strokes with the product and
as you can see I just really take my
time and I just create my shape I tried
to follow my natural brow shape but just
simply thicken it I noticed that
whenever I try to do an entirely
different shape it just doesn't flow my
face as well so I'm just learning that
the more natural to my shape that I
stick the better but I can thicken it
and I'll still feel good
now that that's looking good I'm gonna
go ahead and take this off brow powder
and this is the shading medium in the
brow kit and I'm just gonna go ahead and
lightly go over everything and since I
use a wax based product it can tend to
look a little shiny so using a powder
just really kind of mattifies it in a
really nice natural way and then lastly
I'm gonna go ahead and clean up the brow
I used to do a very dramatic concealer
cleanup but lately I've been going a
little more light because it looks more
natural and just not so perfect like
yeah my brows look perfect but they look
like a natural perfect that's my goal
and then I'm gonna go ahead and just use
a little more brow gel for the hairs on
the end because those just yeah they
just do their own thing and then here
you guys have the finished brows you
guys I love them too so now that we're
done with the brows go ahead and just
finish off the rest of the face yes
brows yes okay so the brows are done you
guys are probably assuming that the
whole video is V voiceover but it's just
like when it comes to brows
I gotta do voiceover it would just be so
challenging for me to top while
perfecting these brows like it's really
like an art form to me so I'm sorry I do
boy so but we're back to me I'm gonna go
ahead and finish off the face as you
guys can see I already have my
foundation everything on but I have not
contoured yet so I'm gonna take the elf
aqua Beauty bronzer and this is my hands
were filled with foundation this is
bronze peach she's used a lot and this
is the alpha blending brush you guys
always ask me about this like what's it
called
it just says blending brush on it and
you can get it at the elf store or on
their site it's one my favorite brushes
by elf and live it I love it
I think I use it in my fancy video
actually with the little contour stick
they have matchsticks in you back to my
bronzing no my lips are crusty we're
gonna pop my gloss that is okay and
we're also gonna use the blush as well
I'm gonna apply my highlighter and I'm
going to use Hart's highlighter and this
is also what else and this is coffee and
cream and I love this one over here and
then lastly we are going to finish the
look with my gloss
all righty so here you guys have the
finished look and yeah here you have it
my gloss is going to be back are you
guys excited yeah did you guys like my
brows yeah I hope you guys did and you
better not clown my brows and say oh my
god let's throw two thick because I like
them and people keep saying oh yeah you
know they're little thick but it looks
good you can't tell me you think of
because I like them look another message
I want to say is that you know if you
like if you're doing something with your
makeup and you feel good about it don't
let anyone tell you that you should not
feel good about it that's very important
because I get comments like oh you know
like I like it I'm getting comments do
you extend it in the day this is your
life because we do say your turn but
really this is your life and these are
your decisions if you are happy with it
stick with it because honestly and this
is so when I was taking a turn people
try to make me feel bad about having
short hair but like oh you need hair oh
you know you guys should know I'm sure
you guys can imagine some of the
comments I receive I like my hair or
lack thereof you know I think it looks
good and I like it I feel confident in
it so I'm not gonna change it because
other people are telling me oh you need
to do this you do that you need to grow
it so yeah I actually do want to like
leave that message to you guys as like a
parting message make sure that you are
not allowing these people to get you
down if you feel awesome about something
if you feel good about it you stick with
it because just who these people man but
other than that sorry for taking a turn
actually not sorry because you need to
hear it I'm glad to that turn but that's
it for this video I hope you guys like
how this turned out I hope you guys
liked the brows I do
hope you guys are excited ever my gloss
because I am so that's it for this video
hope you guys enjoyed it other than that
