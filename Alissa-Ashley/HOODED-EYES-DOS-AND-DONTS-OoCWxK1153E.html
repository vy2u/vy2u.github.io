today's videos gonna be a hooded eyes
do's and don't and I'm just going to
take you through some steps on what you
should do if you have a little hooded
situation and what you should not do
because it's going to emphasize our
hoodies and if you guys hear me say
hoodies that is the word I created to
refer to hooded eyes so yeah thank you
guys for watching and let's jump right
into the video okay so for the first
thing and by the way don't get
distracted by mrs. pimple she just want
to hang out with us today because she's
lonely but the first tip I'm going to
show you guys is within the eyebrows and
I don't know if I mentioned but this is
gonna be my donots eye this could be my
dues I just you guys can see the
difference and let me just go ahead and
fill in this brow and then I'm explain
why you do not want to fill in your brow
this way okay so we blend out a little
bit here we have my kind of horribly
drawn in eyebrow and you're not going to
missing the difference' type on this
eyebrow but basically what you want to
avoid doing is creating a high arch of
course your arch can go higher than this
but you know like my brows kind of
growing in so I don't want to make it
look too crazy but you want to avoid
creating a high arch and you also want
to avoid rounding out your eyebrow here
let me just apply a little more because
I know that wipes them off you want to
avoid doing that because what rounding
it out is going to do is it's just going
to close the eye in and by creating too
high of an arch it's going to give you a
lot more space by creating a high arch
you're giving yourself a little bit more
room to work with however in the as we
go on in the video you'll see why that
may not necessarily work out so let me
just go ahead and do this other eyebrow
so you guys can see the difference and
see how this is really highlighting my
hood and where as you know the brows I'm
going to draw on is kind of decreasing
it set it back up a little bit as you
can see this brow is a little bit more
straight and flat compared to this one
this one by bringing the brow a little
bit down
studies miss by bringing the brow down
it took off so much space so now I'm
rural I'm going to work with this
whereas with this eye we have all this
that we feel obligated to work with and
it should make it even harder for us
being good is okay so the second tip
with hooded eyes is we all know that
since our eyes are so hooded sometimes
we can't put a lot of eye shadow because
it transfers on to our hood so the first
step would be to prime our eyes and like
always I'm going to use my lane little
Paint Pot so now this eyes primed this
one's not a fortune I'm going to see the
difference right now but as we do eye
shadow you will see why it is important
so now it's just I'm - I shadow so for
iron shadow I'm just going to take my
Too Faced chocolate bar palette and I'm
going to demonstrate what not to do on
this eye first as you can see since not
prime the color is barely showing up
okay so as you can see our eye kind of
looks a little small I didn't really
exaggerate it I just kept it very simple
and kept it in this area so let me go
ahead and demonstrate what to do on this
eye and the first thing that you want to
do is set that paint pot with a blank
eyeshadow that's very important because
you're going to get less creasing and
it's going to be very nice space so now
it's more into the eyeshadow and see
what difference is going to be I'm going
to bring the eyeshadow up in my hood
area bring it up as much as possible and
this is a transition shade you do not
want to necessarily do this with more
intense shades just yet and then as you
can see I can't be long gating the
eyeshadow to create an eye shadow wing
and I'll show you guys or explain to you
why I'm doing that in just a second
okay so as you can see this eye sucks
and it's just very very dull it's flat
and you can still see a lot of hood with
this eye as you can see since I brought
these shadow up and since I brought it
outwards it is really opening our eye
and making it appear wider by at the
same time not that hooded always I like
to elongate my eyeshadow by winging out
the eyeshadow and the reason why I do
this is because I don't like doing
winged liner because it just does not
work with my hood and I'm going to move
on to that next to demonstrate what I
mean
so I'm going to take my in 1c liner
actually got the glittery one but
honestly for this video doesn't matter
and I'm going to wing out this eye it's
a hopeful last wing okay so I just wind
up this eye and as you can see that the
main part of the wing that's supposed to
be flaky is hid in my hood so it just
looks very very droopy and really
awkward see when you're looking straight
you just see a little bit black in a you
don't see the fleetness of the wing that
people would not who you guys have so
with this eye with the correct eye as
opposed to applying winged liner you are
going to really want to focus on the
waterline for that extra intensity so
I'm going to go ahead and do that right
now and you guys will see what I mean
so I'm just going to take the LA girl
glide gel liner and focus that into my
waterline it is a little uncomfortable
but you'll get used to it
okay so as you can see we have some
intensity going on on our water line
which is kind of why people doing liner
for more intensity but it's not shutting
our eye out so we stuff that intensity
without shutting it out we are not going
to wing it I will make a video on how to
properly do wing liner because in some
of my videos I do have wing liner and it
seems to be working but I stray from it
but if I am going to look for some extra
intensity I will darken up the waterline
okay so now we have a little bit
intensity we are going to move on to
glitter and pigments these secret oops
almost dropped it these secret to how I
keep all my pigments loose on mine is
Mac mixing medium liner this is
everything I do not have any traffic
problems since using this product and as
you can see it's pretty used up but it
has lasted for me since about January so
why I like to do is take a little bit on
my hand and then I'm going to take this
brush from makeup addiction cosmetics
it's the definer brush it's a like nice
flat brush and first before moving on to
the perfect eye I'm going to demonstrate
using a pigment this is Mac melon
pigment on this aisle without the mixing
medium liners I'm going to take some of
my brush and apply it to my eye okay so
as you can kind of see it's somewhat of
a disaster not only is the pigment not
pigmented like a pigment should be you
look closely it is already transferring
onto my hooded area throughout the day
it will transfer more on to that area so
let me just show you guys what the
mixing medium liner does I'm going to
dab my brush into the mixing medium
liner tilt my head back and apply it to
my lid okay and then let me just try to
find my melon liner because you do not
want to move while doing this you want
to stay tilted back so won't transfer on
to your lid I'm your hood and I'm going
to pack that on as you can see it's much
more pigmented and it is sticking to
that medium liner very well and then for
extra insurance I kind of just like to
take the mixing in liner and just dab a
little layer on top just to kind of seal
it in so I'm still waiting for it to dry
just a little bit but as you can see
it's very pigmented it's not
transferring on to my hood area so now
it is completely dry I'm blinking moving
around you know still have some hood but
it is not transferring I'm going to take
this glitter from glitter and licks or
cosmetics called mining by glowstone and
first I'm going to apply to the battery
okay that looks pretty horrible I'm
going to take the mixing medium water
side and let it dry again so it is dry
and there's still zero transferring and
glitter glitter transfers next tip which
is elongating more using a darker color
on the outer part of your lid and the
first thing I'm going to do on this eye
is show you what not to do and I'm going
to move on to this and show you what to
do okay so as you can see I round it out
the color all over um this um hood area
and the reason why I'm saying not to do
that is because one the main air I made
is not creating a transition color of
course you can do smoky eyes and I will
make a video on how to for hooded smokey
eyes but with this it is not going to
work because the color the dark color is
focused on this area so she's bringing
everything out and with hooded eyes your
best bet is to diffusing um the
smokiness of the eye so let me just go
ahead and show you what I mean on this
side let me just take that same brush
and I'm going to focus on the outer V of
the eye and work on winging it out and
what helps is looking straight to see
where you want that shadow to land
and then pushing it outwards just
following that natural straightness of
the eye so I've applied the dark color
so now I'm going to diffuse it what they
light our transition shade actually
focus on blending everything out make
sure everything's nice and blend it and
sometimes I like to go in with the dark
color again there's for some more
intensity okay so as you can see I did
add darker color right here but I long
gated it just by kind of winging it out
a little bit and I soften it up by
adding my transition shade with hooded
eyes it is so important to spend your
time blending and making sure
everything's seamless because the more
you kind of diffuse and smoke it out and
not even just with dark colors you can
smoke out lighter clothes as well and I
will show you guys that the more open
your eye is going to look and it's not
going to look like this let's go on to
the next tip which is lashes disclaimer
not saying that this lash company is bad
at all okay I'm just showing you guys a
pair that will not work for hooded eyes
and these ones are from sweetheart
lashes in the club party girl and I'm
going to explain to you why they will
not work why not not white right after I
apply them okay so we have applied this
lash let's just get a little bit closer
to yes and see a little more of the glue
so drying but whatever the reason why
this lash isn't the best or the reason I
wouldn't recommend it or just latch like
this in general is because one is
noticeably too thick for hooded eyes a
lash like this will completely shut you
out and it will look too intense and too
crazy and one of the reasons is because
there's not really a gradient effect
from inner corner to outer corner any
lash that is dramatic from here to here
it's not going to work out because it's
going to close your eye up and it's it's
not going to open it and I'm going to
show you a lash that will open it right
now and the latch that I'm going to use
to open it is the velour lashes Carlie
lash let me go ahead and apply and I'll
be right back with you guys okay so here
we have this lash and as you can see I'm
going to get a little closer it
is much more natural the way that it
lays it allows for you to still see your
glitter and it goes from smaller to a
little bit more fuller on the outside a
folder but you know a little bit more
longer on the outside which is really
going to open up your eye a tip that I
like to use is I don't apply the end of
my lash to my waterline I like to apply
it straight on because I noticed that it
really really opens up my eye and
sometimes when I apply it to low down it
creates a drooping effect so yes here's
the lash on and now that we have the
upper eye kind of done let's move on to
the lower eye and what you shouldn't do
and what you should do let me show you
guys what not to do on this eye and then
we're going to move on to this eye you
do not want to do this by the way if you
notice there's still no no transferring
so haha no transferring still anyways a
lot of people recommend to do this
they're like oh it opens up your eye you
know it brings out no no no no no no as
you can see it looks very unflattering
sometimes it works when you doing a pop
of color but for the purpose of the
video this is not look flattering and
you do not want to do this if you want
some smokiness I'm going to show you
right now how to get smokiness but still
make it look very flattering on a hooded
eye and just eyes in general to be
honest now talk to through this one you
want to place the black in your
waterline and bring it to about here and
then you want to blend it out just a
little bit with eyeshadow to create a
nice diffused soft smoky look okay and a
huge tip for anyone just opening their
eyes now just hood just in general
trying to open your eyes you want to
apply a lighter color in the center
okay
so you can clearly see the difference
here this eye is very nice and open of
course you still see the hood you know
and honestly if you have hooded eyes the
best thing to do was just accept it and
work with your situation but it's still
very very beautiful and you still can
pull up a nice eye look and you can
still see the pigment and everything
your eyes look nice and why and very
flattering the last and final tip that
I'm going to give you guys is regarding
your brow highlight your brow bone
highlight so I'm going to take my circle
one brush by artis and I'm going to
apply it the wrong way and then the
right way okay as you can see I applied
it way too low so the I just looks very
very droopy and very very not appealing
and then I'm going to apply it the
correct way so as you can see this one
is a very subtle if you do apply it very
very lightly in this area just to give
your face a little bit of lift without
looking crazy if you give it too much
you're going to get too much emphasis on
your hoodie and that is it and I hope
