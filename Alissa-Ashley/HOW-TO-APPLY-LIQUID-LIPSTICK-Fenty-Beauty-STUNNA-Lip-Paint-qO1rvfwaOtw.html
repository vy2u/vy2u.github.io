today's video is going to be a quick
how-to video on applying lipstick and
it's featuring the new Finn T Beauty
Stunna lip paint in the shade uncensored
that just dropped so if you guys want to
see how to do it then just keep on
watching okay so starting out of my lips
pretty blank because of foundation I'm
gonna go ahead and lightly highlight my
Cupid's bow to enhance my lip shape and
this is gonna come into play as I apply
the lipstick I'm gonna start at the
middle area and not my lining because
that's usually where I get the most
product and that first dip so I don't
want to start that at the top because
then I risk running over and that's how
you get a mess
so you want to start in the middle and
then work your way to that lip lining as
you can see I zoomed in because I wanted
to show you guys that I'm using the
qubits will highlight almost as a
guideline to make sure that I don't go
too over that because that's when I know
that I'm gonna over line and I want to
look very neat also highlighting the
cutes boat it just kind of adds a neat
factor because you have that lightness
to it and then you have your bold lip so
just looks really good also typically
speaking whenever I'm doing a bold lip I
like to get the Cupid's bow out the way
because I find that's the hardest part
of you know succeeding and making a
really nice neat pop and lip so I like
to get that out the way and then I move
on to the rest of my lips now I'm gonna
work on lining the outer parts of my
corners and the biggest tip I can give
you is move your lip as you apply the
product you do not want to just stay
still because then it can get a little
rigid you want to move your lip so it
glides effortlessly and by the way I'm
not dipping back into the product at all
I'm using what's still on the wand
because I do not want a lot of product
build up on the corners I want that area
to just be nice and sharp and neat
next we're gone this big old juicy
bottom lip oh that looks beautiful I
want to do that just for like just cuz
it looks good but I also want to start
in the middle because I'm gonna work my
way to the lining of my bottom lip my
bottom lip has a lot of extra meat so I
like to make sure that it looks really
as you can see I'm using the same
gliding the lint method as I apply the
product to the bottom lip because my
bottom lip yeah it could be a struggle
sometimes because as you can see I have
a lot of extra meat but if I collide
then I get a nice neat line and as you
can see I'm kind of just trying to stay
in the lines because my bottom lip isn't
as defined especially on the outer
corners so I have to make it define
through the lipstick so I want to make
sure that's nice and neat so I'm just
gliding getting really into that inner
corner and using my lips as you can see
I'm pulling my lips back to make sure
I'm getting a really sharp line and
honestly speaking you have to work as a
team with your lips you have to apply
the product while you know involving
your lips and pulling them and making
sure that they're stretching along as
you're gliding the product on to get
that sharp edge I've watched a couple of
videos you know like on makeup artist
and their model and their model will
just be sitting there and it's just like
their lips are frozen no if you're
applying a liquid lipstick especially
you want to make sure you're doing this
because it's a glide on easier and
you're gonna get some sharp lines and
that is what we want we want that too
but that is it for this quick how-to
video I hope you found it helpful if you
guys have any questions let me know and
I'll answer down below but other than
that and you guys so much for watching
and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
