today is going to be how to winged liner
for a hooded eyes and I'm gonna do kind
of what not to do on this eye and then
what to do on this eye I'm left-handed
so this I always comes more naturally to
me which is why I always work on this
eye you haven't noticed and I like to do
this eye off camera because yeah it's
just harder so I mean this one's about
to be a fail anyway but you guys haven't
add to this for quite some time now and
to be quite honest I tried filming this
so many damn times but it is so
intimidating it is like it's just it's
difficult to explain as well as thing
we're just like okay how the hell do I
explain it to people but I think I'm
kind of I'm ready I am ready to embark
on this journey so I'm going to be
creating my wing using the Kat Von D
tattoo liner trooper and the time to use
this product because it's easy to get at
Sephora
it's like nineteen dollars and it's very
very popular right now so I want to use
a product that you know is realistic for
people so yeah by the way if there's any
background noise I do apologize my
neighborhood is just something else but
I can't let that be excuse me not to
film this and I felt like I want to talk
through and not a voice over because
it's just easier to explain so like my
other hooded eyes do's and dont's video
I'm going to go ahead and do the don't I
first and then I've explained what I did
wrong and how to fix it and how to get a
nice wing for the alright
okay so here we have our don't wing and
as you can see you can barely see it
throw baby wing it goes like flute and
oh and that's what tends to happen when
you put it on because you have all the
extra skin covering the wing because I
didn't have that um you know all the
extra skin it will look okay it still
looks like you know a little bit like
 but it's still okay but this is
that all that extra skin and my hoodie
is just hating on me right now
you could wear this to the wing and what
I did wrong was that one it's entirely
too thick so I have smaller eyes I can't
make it thick wing you know I can't be
about that life - I made it - arched and
high up and I didn't allow it to come
just you know be winged out effortless
is too high up and this is too hot up
it's just like it completely lost my
extra skin so I'm gonna go ahead and
talk you guys through the do I I wish
this dog would start stop barking come
here did f enemy but the first thing I'm
doing the dua is just draw a very thin
line across my entire eye
the next thing that I'm going to do is
just assess my eyes I'm going to look
straight forward I'm not going to do
this because oftentimes we do that and
then we're doing the play and were just
like ah yes late and then we look like
this and it's gone so I'm going to look
straight forward and as you can see this
part and this part those are the two
parts that aren't as hooded as this part
if I were to place my weight up here
it'll get lost
place it even right here it will get
lost so I'm going to place it right
right underneath there right there at
the very end of my eye because that's
part is where it kind of ends the hooded
the hooded hooded Miss I'm going to
place my line for my weight at the very
edge of my eye and just move it outwards
just like that we shake this bad boy up
and then I'm going to begin to draw my
waiting as you can see I have that
marked so that is where my wing is going
to go so I can go any further
any lower it's going to go right there
okay so as you can see you can still see
the wing even when looking straight
forward you can still see it so that is
what you want so I'm going to go ahead
and just build on this area not making
it too thick but not make it too thin
either because we still want some fluids
going on the best thing to do is just
keep checking to make sure you're not
going too far up because I could easily
make this toothy and then you will not
be able to see my lid and there we have
the wing and it's very easy to do this
is a standard wing now okay I understand
this point is very you know laid-back
and chill but if you want to really kind
of push in and make a little more
dramatic I recommend working from the
outside and I'm going to show you guys
what I mean just now as opposed to
drawing the length from the inside make
it longer from the outside just like
that because if you're going inside
you're gonna pretty much defeat the
whole purpose of making that point and
your lose the wing so here we have the
wing as you can see it is a huge
different so a huge difference not
different I'm a little nervous which is
why if you notice I've messed up on some
words because it is very very
intimidating but I really hope that what
I just explained makes sense um I try my
best
it's very hard to explain but what
you're essentially doing is just looking
straight forward making the mark where
you see where it's like the least hooded
and then working on your wing from there
because if you do that you won't lose
your wing so much into this all this
extra meat okay we wish this extra meat
was on our booties and our booze was not
it's on a hard freakin eye so we took to
work around it and to work around it you
just work from the out side going in and
yeah as you can see this was too thick
this is too cool
in and that is what we lost it but if
you just allow us to go effortlessly on
the outer part of your eye
the deal will work out so I really hope
that that was helpful if it wasn't and
you can just spyware spank me but I try
my best and I hope you guys like it so
let's just kind of get some some little
angles this flea Kiwi this pathetic wing
alright so you see both and I hope that
you can take these tips and apply them
to your hoodie situation and I will see
you guys soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
