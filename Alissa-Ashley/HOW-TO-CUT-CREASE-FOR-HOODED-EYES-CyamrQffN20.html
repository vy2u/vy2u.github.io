hey I'll take you high training to
darkness let you fade into darkness
he'll be safe
hey you guys went back to my channels so
today's video is going to be a tutorial
on this I look inspired by Palafox eeeh
and I'm sure you guys have been seeing
everyone being inspired by love foxy
because this look was bomb so a lot of
people already did this look and I know
but I gotta represent for my hoodie's
out there because I haven't seen you
elated eyes do it so I was like it's up
to me it's up to me so I decided to do a
hooded eye version of it and it's
definitely a different technique but it
does work out for me when it comes to
doing cut crease looks so hope you guys
take something from it it was a little
bit difficult and it was a hard look so
throughout the video you'll find that
it's hard for me to articulate what I'm
doing so expect to see a lot of screen
pop-ups because it was just very very
difficult for me to explain it and do at
the same time but I want you guys to
enjoy the tutorial so let's just get to
it
let's go I hope you guys are doing it
thank you so much for watching please
subscribe
let's leave go well don't leave let's go
tutorial okay so the first thing to do
is pry my eye I'm using my mac studio
finish concealer if I take my concealer
brush and place it all over my crease
area just over the crease usually I
bring it down if you watch my videos you
know that but I'm only gonna put on the
crease area and I'm gonna blend that out
and I'm just going to lightly carry it
onto the lid nothing too extreme and
like always I'm gonna set it in place
with my Laura Mercier oh god what was
that I'm gonna set in place with my
Laura Mercier translucent powder whoa
okay so before drawing any lines you
guys can see a faint line because I just
ruined my clip but before drawing any
lines or any crease i assess where my
eyes the most hooded eye didn't sin my
last video so I will link that one down
below and honestly if I were to put my
line or my cut crease in my actual
crease area you would not get a seat and
it wouldn't be as pop it so I actually
have to carry my crease above the crease
and
it almost like a fake crease so me go
ahead and assess my eye and alright did
this so I kind of know where to go and
I'm gonna start in the inner corner
because I'm essentially along extending
the inner corner the inner corner starts
right here so I'm just go over it I'm an
act like that hood and all this extra
meat isn't there yes that's how you
explain it yeah this is very tricky to
explain you guys so if I'm humble you
understand starting here not actually
drawing it but using this as a guide to
where I'm going to place my fake crease
okay so we have the line down as you can
see it's almost like it's coming from
out of the little inner corner but it's
not so you just created your fake crease
we did it okay so now I'm going to work
on making this nice and blended up top
so I'm taking my zoeva 2:37 detail
shader brush and I'm taking a nice
orange shade it helps to lift your eye
as well just to kind of make blending a
little bit easier I'm not going to carry
this shadow all the way in most of its
gonna be focused on this side the outer
corner area and I'm gonna take Anastasio
Sienna and just place that right on top
I'm not going to carry up as much as the
orange now I'm going to take my winged
liner brush that I used to create the
line early I'm taking honest osseous
fudge and place that right by my crease
now that our crease is pretty much done
I'm going to take my consumer brush and
just clean up you want to take a little
bit concealer
okay so the next thing you want to do is
just take your most creaseless concealer
that you possibly own mines is the
Maybelline instant age rewind concealer
and I use this to clean up my lid and I
chose this one because it dries down a
little bit of matte and it does increase
as much all my other concealers would
have creased on me next I'm taking my
meet matte nude palette and I'm taking
Matt Malloy mixed with Matt Lombardi I'm
gonna set that in place and I chose
these shouds because they're very very
pigmented nice and creamy and nice and
opaque so they're perfect for my lid and
now I'm taking on a Stassi it's orange
soda because I want a bit of a tint to
it I don't want to be completely white
the next thing we do is apply my winged
liner I'm choosing Kat Von D's tattoo
liner because I feel like it's just
easiest to apply also the Kat Von D gets
really close to the lash line and I'm
doing a skinny skinny skinny skinny wing
so I do not want it to be too thick
I'm gonna go ahead and apply some
mascara now go ahead and apply some
lashes these are huda beauty lashes in
the style Sascha and I am loving them
because I wanted a lash I was gonna be
too fluffy to the point where you
essentially can't see anything but I
didn't ye that are too flat either so
these are perfect okay so now for the
glitter which is everyone's favorite
part I'm taking a paint brush this is a
angular shader paint brush but any
angled brush will do make sure that's
skinny so that you get really close to
that crease line and I'm dipping onto my
hand because I have Mac mixing medium
liner on my hand oh my God my hands mess
and I'm just going to coat the liner
paint brush and I'm just going to draw a
little line I'm start in the middle cuz
it's a good place to start you just want
to go you want a good time with this
basically you don't want to put a whole
line of mixing medium liner because
you'll be wasting it and I'm going to
dip inside of my clitter I'm using
kryolan's gold glitter gonna blow my
brush I don't want any fallout and I'm
just going to go directly on to where I
place the Mac mixing me a liner and I'm
going to make the liner a little bit
thicker on this in is they get thinner
when I get to the inner corner
I'm going to bronze with my two-faced
dog chocolate Soleil bronzer I'm using a
new Sephora brush by the way it's the
pro airbrush 55 just a number 55
for blush I'm taking NARS I'm not
pronouncing that you'll pop them on the
screen today for highlight first time I
take champagne pop and I'm going to take
my new Sephora 93 brush I chose my
snapchat it looks really cools I got it
you know anytime I could be satisfied I
want more but let me go ahead to the
other cheek let me be reasonable then
we'll go ahead and highlight my inner
corner with champagne pop and I'm
switching to an elf concealer brush it's
really tiny and I want that highlight to
be very focused and not too blown out
you're struggling trying to find a lip
color so this is my accommodation number
three of my attempt so I'm taking
Geoffrey Stars dominatrix and I've taken
Kat Von D's Vampira
and then decide to kind of tie the upper
and lower eyes together I'm going to add
just a little bit of black liner a
little bit of brown shadow to the outer
corners I'm taking my Marc Jacobs
highlighter gel crown I'm going to take
my Anastacio fudge iron shadow and I'm
going to take norm also my own Stassi
I'll just connect them together the last
time you just go ahead and set my face
with my Scandinavian finishing spray and
then here is the finished look I really
like how came out I feel like typically
I wouldn't wear this on everyday
occasion I just like how it kind of
gives the eye a different feel and I
just like it I like it so hope you guys
like it as well if you did please make
sure it gives me a thumbs up and
subscribe other your neck thank you for
watching you know the drill time to cut
some slow bows and I'll see you guys
soon
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
