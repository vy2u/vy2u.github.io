were asking me to do a hair tutorial on
my ramen noodle hair that's you guys
call it so I'm like you know what let me
just embrace it because that's just what
they're gonna call it I can either get
mad about it or just embrace that my
hair looks like ramen noodles so I'm
gonna embrace it so a lot of you guys
are acting in my last tutorial can I do
a little quick hair tutorial now I've
done this on my channel before but I
guess it's okay for me to do an updated
one because I have more people here now
and also that one kind of got washed out
because it was a hair and makeup
tutorial so it's like it just wasn't
it's not like it's own star of the show
so I went ahead and did this for you
guys very quick very simple and hope you
guys like it this makeup look will be on
my channel soon so don't be like yes
like okay yeah the hair but where's the
makeup
it'll be there soon do not worry but
let's go ahead and get into this hair
tutorial and hope you guys enjoy it yeah
okay okay so first we'll go ahead take
some water I don't have a spray bottle I
don't okay cuz usually my hair is
already wet I'm just go ahead and just
kind of wet it a little bit because it
does need to be a little bit wet to work
with me better and for those who acts
I don't perm my hair I don't relax my
hair I don't do any other thing you do
your hair the only thing I do do is
bleach it and cut it obviously but that
is it next I'm taking my eco styler gel
I do like using the clearing because it
doesn't affect my hair shade
I noticed that whenever I used to use
the green one it kind of would add a
little bit of a yellow tint to my hair
and with blonde hair you don't want that
so I'm gonna go ahead and take this take
a brush I'm just going to use that to
lay down all of my hair just get nice
and flat I like to have a bit of a part
in my hair as well I think it looks very
cute
use my hand for this front part I don't
brush my makeup okay so here is step one
just lay down I mean technically a step
two but yeah this is what you do you lay
it down first next I'm taking my comb
and this is the kind of comb I to take I
know my comb is dirty but I like to use
this kind of like fatter into the comb
go ahead and just create swirls I just
go in a pattern I just start from like
right here boom boom boom boom boom boom
it's so easy and then like if I kind of
miss one I just kind of go in and follow
that same pattern and it's almost I kind
of do like a zigzag pattern but just
swirls in your hair and I notice that
it's easier to get neater swirls when my
hair is a little bit shorter like this
length the longer it gets the harder it
gets to do it and within a couple
minutes you're gonna look a package of
ramen noodles this is like my favorite
hair style I mean I know that some
people like to call the ramen noodle
hairstyle but I mean it's called like
waves you know like that's just what
they are but uh where do they go with
the flow here the noodles and to me it's
such a cute hairstyle that gets such a
fun hairstyle especially they have short
hair and a lot of people said they cut
their hair because of me because of my
video of me cutting my hair so here's a
style for you if you cut your hair and
you happen to do blonde - a lot of
people did the blonde - so I was like
wow do I really have that much of an
influence that's freaking awesome like
short Blondie's man short Blondie's and
then with the back I honestly don't even
I can't see it I've got a feel for it
and just hope it looks good I'm just
being honest I can't do the back um but
sometimes I just acts whoever I'm around
I hate like this is okay
or I take a photo with my phone and
usually it looks okay usually and
literally I mean that's honestly it
sometimes I have little parts that are
kind of sticking up so I just go with my
finger and just kind of use that too
late
a little bit but take some of this
Madame CJ Walker it's the edge control
shape and paste dip into it I may use
that to just kind of tame my edge area I
don't want to put more gel I just want
to put that yes yes ramen noodles come
through actually by noodle last night
and they were like on hit at pepper to
my rules you know use pepper it comes
out like really good lunch sticking out
so everything's nice and good and you
are good to go with your ramen noodle
hair so honestly I mean as you guys can
see it's super easy to do very easy not
that many steps and here is the finished
little results so I'm trying to make
sure it's a focus you guys can really
see the hair hope you guys like this
little mini hair tutorial if you want to
see other like kind of short hair style
videos my hair grows very fast so it
will probably be like 2 inches longer
like a month so I definitely have more
plans so yeah just let me know what you
want to see other than that hope you
guys enjoyed this little video you guys
will get this makeup look soon and I
will see you guys on next upload</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
