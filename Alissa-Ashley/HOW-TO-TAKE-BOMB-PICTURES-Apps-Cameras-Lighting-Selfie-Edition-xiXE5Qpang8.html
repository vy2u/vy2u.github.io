today's video it's not gonna be a mega
tutorial however is gonna be super duper
helpful because a lot of you guys were
asking me how I achieve my photos like
the apps the lighting the camera so I
decided to film a video on it a couple
weeks ago I asked you guys but though
you guys are saying yeah my eyeballs
saying no and it's time to get to a
rational just horrible so yeah you
follow me on snapchat you know I've been
like freakin complaining I'll say
bitching Battlement cuz
complaining about my eye for a long time
but it finally got better today was a
beautiful sunny day so I decided to just
film it today and I hope you guys like
it I talk a lot with my hands
but of you guys like it help you guys
find to be very informative we'll be
going over apps apps to girls and point
lighting and a camera so hope you guys
take in all this information so you guys
are selfies could be on point and so you
guys make up photos whatever you take to
be on point let me know if you guys like
it let me know if you guys like
informative videos like this other than
that thank you so much for watching
thank you so much for watching please
subscribe if you enjoyed it and I will
see you guys soon yes probably sick of
me like talking my hand I'm just doing
all this let's go let's go okay so topic
number one will be apps I'm going to
show you guys two of my favorite apps
that I use in pretty much every single
photo when it comes to editing the first
one being in light app this is 399 in
the App Store and I use it mainly for my
thumbnail collages on here as well as
targeting certain areas in my photos you
guys will see in the demo in just a
second and my favorite app is facetune
this is also 399 and this is perfect for
smoothing out little imperfections as
well as adding detail and now let's jump
to the demo now I won't be going over
each facetune feature because there's so
many however some them include widening
your teeth reshaping whatever you got to
shape patching up imperfections as well
as toning them
so yeah you get the app just play around
it and you see what I'm talking about
but right now I'm just gonna go ahead
and smooth up my skin a bit I don't do
this in every single photo however I am
breaking out so when I break out I do do
this because I don't like rigging out
and now I'm just going to go ahead and
just add a little bit of detail and I
like to add detail to my eyes mainly
because it just really pops my makeup a
bit and I just like how it looks and now
I'm just go ahead and patch up something
on my neck I am having an eczema
breakout on my neck and I just wanted to
show you guys how patching works you can
just take the area you don't want and
you just patch it over the perfect skin
if that makes any sense you got to play
with the app but you'll see what I'm
saying and now I'm just going to go
ahead and do focus the background this
step isn't really something I do but I
know that some people like it so I'm
just go ahead and show you guys and I
think I'm good to go so I'm go ahead and
save my photo and jump to the next app
the next app is in light and I'd love to
use in light for targeting areas mixing
up my photos like how you see my cool
little thumbnails adding text as well as
their filters the filters are Bom
and only use them sometimes but when I
do they're popping so right now as you
can see the little target is red and I
like to kind of place it over my face
just to give me a nice little tan you
know a nice little warmth to my skin
because I like to look really really tan
and I just wanted this app is best for
that because it doesn't over saturate
the photo and I'm just go into mixer
just to kind of show you guys what it
looks like it's very very easy to use I
know that desi Perkins did a video and
hers is legit and she went through
everything so I'll link hers down below
because yeah she probably helped more
than I can in terms of the apps because
he has she broke it down she broke it
down but I just want to show you guys
what I did I'm so go ahead and save the
photo because I'm done and now I'm
opening up the Instagram app and this is
my favorite source of editing and I'll
show you guys why it's so easy and my
favorite is adding brightness warmth
contrast in sometimes saturation if I
have
and already done it and I like to add
brightness because it just kind of
really makes the photo look a little
more clear I don't do it all the time
only sometimes I always add warmth
because I feel like warmth is like the
Sun following you even if it's gloomy in
winter you knows my photos are still
warm and that's the warmth freakin
feature that's the warmth it's popping
and now of course I had to flip my damn
photo because that's what I do
and then our photo is done being edited
here's before here's after afters
popping and I hope you guys liked it now
on to the next topic which would be
camera and lighting the first lighting
I'm going to go over is the window and
this is my main selfie taking spot you
guys should be super familiar with this
and my tip to you be using window
lighting and what makes it amazing is
that it isn't letting in harsh and
direct sunlight because on the side of
the house so you're getting just enough
sunlight to hit you but not too much so
just gives the perfect nice brightness
to your skin and now move on to outdoor
lighting and cameras here's our nail
she's using her iPhone 6s and she got a
finding I said 5s and she's using these
selfie cam these selfie cam is great but
the quality isn't really sharp it's not
as professional but it is convenient and
here I am look not good involved and I'm
using my iPhone 6s plus and I love to
use the back cam I tell you guys about
this camera all the time and the quality
is crisp the color is more accurate but
the only thing is it's difficult getting
a good angle look a little in the noon
look a little big head a huge tip that
can give you guys is to learn how to
adjust the lighting through your phone
it does take practice because you know
you can either over expose it or under
expose it but once you get that you know
nice middle ground it can either make or
break your selfie most the time make it
here is a photo of no adjusting as you
can see it was nice but a little bit
shadowy here is completely overexposed
and as you can see it looks very harsh
and here is my little middle ground
where I found that it looks the best and
here is a comparison of all three as you
can see it makes a huge difference now
here is a quick example of lighting you
want to avoid super harsh sun lighting
it creates way too many shadows and it's
just really really not flattering
whatsoever as you can see we both look
at Matt hurt and lastly if you want to
take it up a notch you can get the sony
a 5100 a bunch of people on instagram
have it i promise you they all use it
it's a really great selfie camera for
makeup here's a photo with no flash and
you can see it looked really really nice
and they don't know her hair was flying
in the wind and here is it with flash it
just takes the perfect selfies for
makeup it does not get rid of a
saturation of it and I personally feel
like the photos are better with the
flash intelligent auto or manual and
it's awesome because as a flip screen so
you can see yourself and it's Wi-Fi
compatible signature photos instantly
and the last and final tip that I'll
give you guys is just to honestly be
confident in your selfie and that sounds
very corny but I'm being very serious be
confident in the photos that you're
taking honestly no photo will come out
great if you're not confident with it
there's been plenty of times when I've
tried taking photos where I'm not being
you know or feeling my best and they
don't come out great no matter how beat
the face is you have to be confident
within yourself and you tend to be happy
but like I feel like happiness is the
best filter that sounds so cliche but it
really truly sincerely is can you can
really tell when you're happy when
you're just like I'm slaying and no one
could tell me otherwise so just be
confident with yourself also don't feel
like you have
you have like super cool tech gear just
all these cameras ain't they don't feel
that you have to have it just like what
you have it just make it happen because
we've all started somewhere
Isis take photos my metro phone I
thought was the coolest thing out like
we all start summer so don't get
discouraged just keep on pushing and
yeah that's the best advice I can give
you keep on pushing be confident be
happy and just do what you can with what
you have be gripped whatever you have
and that's it hope you guys enjoyed this
video please again let me know if you
guys like these kind of videos and I'll
do more and thank you so much for
watching I'll see you guys soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
