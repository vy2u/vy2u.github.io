hey you guys on back to my channel
today's video is going to be a tutorial
on how I applied my clip ins when I post
a selfie on Instagram a couple days ago
you guys loved them which I'm very very
happy about because I love the moon
swirl and you guys want to see a
tutorial because you guys can't you guys
are just feeling it now it's okay you're
feeling it I'm feeling it it's tutorial
time so I'm going to show you guys how I
applied these clip ins they are from
curly clips these are these shoulder
chic spirals and I want to make sure to
kind of put the name up there because a
lot of you guys want to know which sets
I was wearing on my photo I'm wearing
two sets these are the shade natural
black and I chose natural black because
those ones can be dyed and you know I
feel like down the line I may add some
highlights may you know add some brown
and there you know just to kind of spice
it up a bit and yeah I'm let me kind of
stand up to show you guys they go to
about right there they're pretty they're
pretty coyly I really like them a lot
they got about right here and I have a
little side kind of style because I just
I'm a side con person so and I feel like
you know it was a little bit tricky for
me to kind of blend my natural hair so
this is the way I got to work so I'm
gonna show you guys how I do that they
are my first clip-ins
ever so I don't have anything to compare
them to but I can tell you that they're
absolutely beautiful and I just like the
fact that I found a company that
specialized in providing clippings for
natural hair because you know a lot of
clipping companies you know they have
gorgeous clip ends but they're not gonna
knock your hair they're all you know
straight and you know everything you see
everything day so I'm glad to find them
because you know I like this style you
know I feel confident and I feel pretty
cool so I think that it could possibly
make a beautiful confident cool - which
one I want to introduce you guys to them
so yeah enough talking because I'm gonna
mess this up and this is like take 25 of
my intro so honest I'm talking that
before I messed it up but I hope you
guys like the video give it
thumbs up if you do and feel free to ask
me any question about these clippings
even though I'll probably answer
anything you want to know throughout the
tutorials so yeah let's just jump into
the tutorial over there okay so since
I'm a clip in newbie I feel like it'll
be much easier for me to have my hair
braided so that's why I did and the
braid that I was pointing out is going
to be my leave out braid so I'll just
showing you guys that and kind of it was
kind of my excuse for why it looks all
funky because yeah it looks pretty bad
compared to other braids but that one's
going to be taken out to do not worry
first I'm going to take this three clip
clipping and I'm going to clip it to the
lower part of my hair I'm not really
good at hair terminology because I never
do hair tutorials so forgive me if I
sound a little bit strange or if I'm not
saying the right words but I'm sure you
guys will be able to follow me the
reason I decided to put that clip in
first is because I clipped it kind of at
the back part of my hair and I felt like
it almost acted as a guidance and kind
of like a marking so that I know that I
don't have to take this clipping all the
way down because that clipping is all
right back there as you can see it's
covering you know a pretty decent amount
of the back part of my hair so now when
I put in this clip in I don't have to
take it down too far because it will run
to the other clipping which is already
filling it out so make any sense
I hope make sense now I'm taking another
clip in and I'm doing the exact same
thing it's pretty um honestly it's
pretty easy
I didn't think clippings would be so
easy and that's why I'm so excited
because it's just such a nice protective
style to do so I'm very very happy and
these clippings are so soft and easy and
just yeah I was really really filling
these clippings a whole lot I'm sure you
guys can tell with my selfies and I'm
just go ahead on the other side
including it another three clip I
decided to take the clip ends you know
the four and the three clip ends just to
kind of fill them out and then I took
the two clips and did the rest of the
hair I want to kind of get the longer
ones out the way so I could put those in
the area where I want you know the most
volume and I'm gonna take the two clip
ends and just build on top of that so I
just took another two clip and I'm
putting on the front and I put a two
clip in the back and I'm going to do
that
at over and over again until that side
is complete
and then for this last braid over here
since it's a little bit short I had to
take a two clip clip in and then I
actually snipped one of my two two clip
clip ins and turn them into one clips
and I put the one clip more towards the
front I just feel like it just made the
most sense as opposed to taking two two
clip ends and it just yet they wouldn't
have been as secure now I'm going to
start working on my leave out I am just
unbraid the braid and since I didn't
really want much of that leave out to be
out I took a little bit of hair I laid
down I put a one clip clipping right on
top of that and I took more hair and I
put another clipping on top of that I
didn't do this too many times but I did
it enough until I got to the front part
of my braid and then that's when I had
to start working on actually blending
that with the clip ends and now I'm just
going to part my hair so that you know I
have enough hair on one side and enough
here on the other side and I took a
little bit of my leave out because I
feel like I had a little bit too much
and I thought there's a little bit of a
gap and I want that part to be fuller
and I placed a two clip clip in right on
top of that just to kind of fill it out
because it was a little bit of a space
and I do not want that now I'm just kind
of you know filling it out seeing I'm
going to do and I realized that it'll be
smart of me to get a brush and kind of
poof out my natural hair as well as poof
out the top part of the clip in so that
the textures look quite similar or more
similar than they already did and then I
began to take bobby pins and just Bobby
pinning the ends of my hair down I felt
like since my hair personally is just a
little bit on the dead side and it just
you know wasn't so flattering I felt
like the best thing to do was just bobby
pin it down so as you can see I tucked
my natural hair underneath the clip in
and then I bobby pin in I felt like this
is the best method because I didn't want
to just bobby pin the hair right on top
of the clip in I want to tuck it
underneath so that you know the top part
looks a little bit poofy it has a little
bit of volume but the bottom half of my
hair where it's a little bit more dead
just not so appealing what slipped
underneath the clipping so as you can
see I'm just taking my little short hair
taking the clipping hair and twisting it
underneath and then Bobby pinning it
this little method really really worked
out for me and kind of saved me because
at first I wasn't sure what I was going
to do but this really worked out and
then since I'm kind of turning into a
little side style I just want to make
sure to kind of you know bobby pin the
edge part of my hair so that once I
screw to the side it looks really really
nice and kind of natural now the last
thing I'm going to do is just kind of
slid down my little baby hairs with a
toothbrush and my edge control I will
have the one that I used link down below
and you can see why my body pins kind of
peeking out but I did fix that and now
we have the finished style as you can
see you can tell her my real hair is
because the body pins secure them so
well and I really made sure to pouf it
out so that it wasn't extremely obvious
that I was trying to hide my natural
hair so I really hope you guys enjoyed
this tutorial I hope that you took
something from it let me know how I did
and I'll have all of the information for
these clip ends down below thank you so
much for watching and I will see you
guys soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
