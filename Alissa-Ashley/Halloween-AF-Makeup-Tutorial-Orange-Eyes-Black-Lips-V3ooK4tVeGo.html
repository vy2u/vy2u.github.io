happy October 1st until October 1st
isn't like a thing but it's like it's
Halloween this month and I just I'm so
excited for it because I have so many
cool things brand and also this is just
my way of putting out a video so you
guys can have something to comment down
below and tell me what you want to see
for me some weed and what kind of toys
want to see what you want to be all that
stuff so hey loud cars outside so but I
just want to post a video for you guys I
know I don't know I've been slacking
lately and that's because I just have a
lot going on but we're gonna get
together ok so you know thank you for
being patient with me and not cussing me
out alright
I'm just trying this and I'm gonna do
what I can to make sure you guys are
happy but I just decided to put together
this little tutorial for you guys on
this very Halloweeny look to set the
tone for this month so if you wanna see
how I got this then just keep on
watching and hope you guys enjoy it okay
so my eyebrow isn't done because I'm
gonna put foundation all that stuff on
so they get ruined anyway sometime you
know it's my time but the first thing
I'm gonna do is go ahead and take this
on Nastasia waterproof cream color and
this is honey just as my base and I'm
gonna go ahead and just apply this just
to really brighten my eyelid and prime
it and make sure it's nice and mattified
and then normally I would set it with
some powder but I do not need to do that
I'm going to take these NYX face and
body paint does they look like this one
got some powder on it and this is yellow
and red I'm mixing together to create an
orange base I'm gonna take it morphe e
22 just to apply this use my finger just
to kind of blend out a bit now top of
that I'm going to take this sugarpill
palette I know it is like it's bad I'm
gonna use the orange and the yellow in
that palette and I'm gonna take a morphe
r39 I'm just gonna set this orange base
in place with the orange eyeshadow from
the sugarpill palette you want to take
your time with this so you're not making
the base all uneven just pack the
eyeshadow on first until it's nice and
mattified and then you can start doing
your little blending motion but for now
I'm just packing it on
think I take the yellow and pack that
right on top but take some more orange
next take you this Makeup Forever aqua
liner it's the black one I'm taking this
dose of colors winged liner brush I'm
taking this one because it's nice and
thin and I want a nice and thin brush to
create a nice wing I'm gonna go ahead
and create a winged liner for your wing
you want to be a nice decent size
because we're gonna put glitter on top
of it so try to make it a medium size go
ahead and create my wing
now to go ahead and wipe off my wing
liner brush with a makeup wipe and I'm
gonna go ahead and take some mixing
medium lining my Mac on the back of my
hand you only need a little bit do not
need a lot and I'm taking this orange
and glitter this is by eye candy and
it's called pumpkin pie and I'm going to
do is I'm going to take some mixing
medium liner a very thin layer and we go
in sections and apply the glitter right
on top
I look crazy but now we have to go ahead
to our foundation and all that stuff
let's go ahead and do that
stop looking crazy I'm getting my morphe
e6 just to blend this out and if I can
see what I'm going to take my Kat Von D
lock-it concealer and this is a shade
warm now go ahead and mix in this
lighter shade just to highlight a little
bit and I just realized that the
concealer isn't called warm because this
one's called warm - so early - the names
of these actually but they're both for
warm concealers that's which means new
and everything else would be in the
description bar
I'm gonna go ahead and set in place
miler Mercier powder and then for the
rest of my face I'm gonna take my
Sephora micro smooth powder in the shade
tan and this is a morph de to you like
just swirl it around it first and I like
to dip into my Laura Mercier powder
Larimer say learn merci
like that my Laura Mercier powder and I
just like to just set my face with it
okay swivel around dip it to learn mer
and just set my face for under my eye
I'm going to take that same Nix paint
where I mix the yellow in the red to get
orange and use as a base and on top of
that I'm gonna take my sugar pill orange
eyeshadow and this is a zoeva 230 brush
just set it in place
and in four lashes these are Liam lash
in style
Naomi which are some of my favorites
that's a conch I'm taking my NARS
contour blush and Gina and I would take
from our cool tone shade and mix it with
the darker shade use that when we do the
darker shade but I want that cool tone
