another brush bootcamp I know you guys
have been waiting for another one I've
been doing so bad everyone's like we're
first bootcamp and I'm just yeah let's
just say I had to get back into my flow
of filming but as you can see that flow
is back I literally upload a video every
single day this week so I'm on it okay
so today is another breast bootcamp but
before I get into brush bootcamp I do
want to touch base about an app that
told you guys about couple weeks ago
before I moved and this is not a
sponsorship but this app is called
wisher and I told you guys I'll be
picking people's wishes to grant and
here all those people
I just want to announce it on my channel
so that you guys are informed that I did
choose people and all that good stuff
because I never got to do it on like any
of my media's I never got to show you
guys what is so here those people but
back to brush bootcamp
this is going to be a halo I brush
bootcamp that is why I decide to do
because you guys have been asking me
also before we get into it and I'm
trying to jam and everything so I'll
give everything if you guys want to see
more I brush bootcamps let me know which
specific eye shadow Styles you want to
see and if it's not if you want me to
move into the face brush bootcamp let me
know in the comment section down below
so I can know if I can prepare myself
for next Friday let me know what you
guys want because I do what you guys
want so let me know okay okay so those
long intros we're done now let's go
ahead and move this I shall look I hope
you guys enjoy it
okay so first I'm gonna take the m4 1:12
and I'm gonna go ahead and apply my
transition is shade and I'm just placing
this all over my crease area
they don't go on top of that with a
deeper shade and said use this just kind
of adds like a just to warm up the eye
so it's not to blank when I add my
little darker shades on the inner and
outer corners of the eyes it doesn't
look too blank so I just want to add
that right there next I'm going to take
the morphe in 169 in my deep brown shade
and we'll place that on the outer corner
as well as the inner corner of my eye
I'm a continue to build those up and
whenever I need to soften it out and
blend a little bit I'm going to take the
in for 1:12
just to make sure that it's a nice blend
when we get together she says let's make
this open relationships are better when
you leave out the hope and wish I could
simply just tell her whatever we had is
broken I've had any even deeper brown
and just continue to build up the
intensities on the inner outer part of
my eyes outside outside is no feelings
baby you say it's hot it down what I've
been thinking lately
but behind closed doors I'm awful for
you she says let's make this open
relationships are better
and then to kind of soften things up a
bit I'm going to take a 17 and the
reason I'm taking the a 17 is because
since it is synthetic it's different
kind of brush hair it kind of moves the
eyeshadow around a little bit more than
a natural hair brush will do so I kind
of want to do this to manipulate the
eyeshadow so it looks neater and more
blend it together
now before applying my shimmer in the
inner part of the eye I'm going to take
the m22 too and take a plain matte white
eyeshadow and just apply this bright
white shimmer is gonna be and if it gets
on my Brown that is fine and go ahead
and fix it it is no problem just go
ahead and take a little bit of my brown
eyeshadow and just fix that up and I'm
gonna take some mac makes a medium liner
and I'm going to take the e19 brush fits
nice and tiny and it's perfect for this
little area that we're creating and I'm
gonna apply that first and on top of
that I'm gonna take my shorts out out of
choice I decided to go with something a
little more gold in
and on top of that I took a little bit
of the Knicks go ham a pigment because
I've just been loving this pigment and
it's gonna add a nice yellow element to
the eyeshadow and as you can see I
allowed for the shimmery eyeshadow
transfer just a little bit to give it a
more natural upward motion because since
my eyes are hooded I can't create that
really nice big open space like people
that do halo eyes do so I just kind of
want to have a little bit upwards and
I'm going to take my brown eyeshadow and
move it very lightly across it to kind
of close it off but not really just a
little bit
very lightly and then on my m4 112 I may
take a little bit more orange eyeshadow
that I placed earlier and bring that
upwards
for under the eye I'm going to take my
kiss New York roasted coffee lip pencil
and I place on the inner and outer
corners of the eye and the reason I'm
doing this is because I want to kind of
have a halo effect all the way through
the eye especially seeing as though
simply don't have a lot of lids face
it's kind of like a half it's a half
halo so I kind of want to complete it by
making up for the lack of lid space on
the bottom of my eye so I'm go ahead and
just take this pencil first any brown
pencil will do but this just have some
of my favorite and place on the inner
and outer core and I and I'm going to
take the e36 just just smudge that out
and go ahead and set it in place with
the brown shadow that I used earlier
and then layer my diva brown right on
top
I'm gonna take this NYX jumbo eye pencil
and this is cashmere I'm taking this as
a base for my shimmer shade on the
bottom
then I'm gonna take the e 19 in my goal
to shade and just pop that right on top
I'm also getting a little bit of my next
go hand pigment now we'll go ahead and
add a heavy coat of mascara to the top
and bottom lashes it lifts for lashes on
the pop on Lily lash in the style
opulence and I'm wearing these because
they're more natural and I want that pop
of sparkle in the middle of the pop
so here is the finished eyelook and I
love how came out girls very scared
because my first time doing halo I I
love how it turned out
go ahead and get some slow-mo shots the
I already zoom out closes out and let's
just do this let's do this right now
and then I realized this after all right
backing out changing my lens do all the
stuff but I do want to add a brow
highlight just a bit of lift the eyes so
I'm going to take the in one five seven
which you should have to follow mu camp
and a place a nice champagne shade right
on my brow bone and a little bit my flat
fold I don't want the flappy fold to be
the focus of the look I want you to pop
in the center so I want to add a little
bit just because it's a habit
but not a lot like literally cure so
much not too much okay so here is the
finished look and I was very nervous
about this I shall look because it's
just it's tricky like I know it looks
very simple but it's tricky with the
placement and make sure your eyes don't
look just weird and yeah it's just clear
like I don't know I'm not used to it I
know that it's like the same color
scheme of what I'm used to and I only
did this color scheme because I told you
guys to get the 35 oh so I want you guys
to follow along obviously but I do want
to try this with more color schemes in
the future so let me know what colors
you want to see me do is kind of I look
with it I will oblige and do for you
guys just to spice it up other than that
hope you guys like this also I am
thinking about beginning
face first bootcamp like I mentioned the
beginning so let me know do you guys
want a couple of more eye ones even
though I I can't think right looks right
now so you have to suggest that as well
or you guys want me to move to the face
one because if you do I'll go ahead and
work on that so I can have that for next
Friday but you have to let me know so
let me know what you want
umm and I will get to it so other than
that thank you so much for watching and
I'll see you guys soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
