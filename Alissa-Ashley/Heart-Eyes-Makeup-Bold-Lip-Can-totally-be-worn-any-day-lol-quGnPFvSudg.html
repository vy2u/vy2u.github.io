today's video is going to be on this
makeup look that you see right here and
I want to say it's a Valentine's Day
makeup look but honestly speaking you
can wear this makeup any day you do not
have to wear on Valentine's Day if you
don't have Valentine that's okay I'm
letting you know that right now still
enjoy the day so today's video is going
to be on this and before we jump into
the tutorial I want to go ahead let you
guys know that this video is sponsored
by NARS yes we got another Nara sponsor
in here and you guys know I love NARS
you guys are know the drill they sponsor
this video so if you guys want to know
how I got this look then just keep on
watching and I hope you guys enjoy it
okay so the first thing that I'm gonna
do is go ahead and prime my face I'm
gonna use the pore and shine control
primer I only took about this much and
I'm gonna focus it mainly on my forehead
and my nose area because those tend to
get very shiny they're shiny into you
too okay next I'm gonna take the natural
radiant Longworth foundation and okay I
have used this here before on my channel
and the last time I used it actually use
a different shade but upon further
investigation this is the most accurate
of my shade and it's so cool actually to
even have that sort of option because
there is a really wide shade range this
is in fact NARS this biggest shade range
yet and there's so many shades honestly
that will go well with my skin here I'll
show you guys actually me demonstrate
what I discovered okay so first you have
Cadiz i'ma shake them up just shake them
before you use it so this would be a
really good match for me I mean I'm sure
you guys can kind of visualize it blend
it out right right but wait and then I
have more Moorea
I hope pronouncing it right I'm really
bad at pronouncing names but I try my
best go ahead and put this on as I'm
sure you guys can see that this could be
a potential match as well this is
definitely more of a summer shade though
because I do get a little more tan in
the summer but this will work as well
and then I have this shade and this was
my perfect match but I have so many like
even when I first started wearing like
makeup
my first high-end foundation was
actually NARS sheer glow foundation in
the shade Tahoe I used to buy it this is
before the pump like that's how much
that's a long event buying it and I used
to be Tahoe but I got a little tan so
now our Nels Tahoe for a shade reference
and then I discovered that I am carcass
okay so this is the shade that I found
matched me perfectly you see that you
guys see you guys see so when I blend
this out in a second and you will see
that this matches me like amazingly I
don't they I've ever had a foundation
that matched me so beautifully but the
tone of this is like this is a little
more warm tone it works but it's a
little warm tone this is a little bit
late it still works but it's a little
bit light and this is just like perfect
so let me go ahead and just wipe these
off and then we go ahead and apply my
shade okay so now we go ahead and just
use my finger
it's a beautiful shade on a beautiful
day to wear a beautiful shade I was shut
up and just apply my foundation and then
I go ahead and take a morphe y6 just to
buff this in you guys are like what the
heck Alyssa you always blend your
foundation with a sponge I've been
trying to brush and I dig it in this
foundation it works beautifully with
this brush it's a perfect match let's
get married
[Laughter]
okay so we are good or natural radiant
we're gonna be long we're and now let's
go ahead and put on some concealer now
for concealer I'm gonna take the radiant
creamy concealer and they actually added
more shades of this concealer too so
they're killing it in the foundation
range and the concealer range and I
actually used to use the shade biscuit
in this concealer I have like a lot of
biscuits I have biscuits on biscuits
biscuits but now I'm using caramel
because it's just some more better fit
for me it's a better fit and I'm gonna
go ahead and quickly set this in place
with my makeup revolution banana powder
okay the base is looking flawless now
I'm gonna go ahead and save some time
and do my brows off-camera I do have an
updated routine I'll link it below but
I'm gonna do mob camera because I take a
long time and I'll be right back with
you guys okay so as you can see one eye
is done off camera I'm gonna go ahead
and do the other first I'm gonna go
ahead and conceal my brow as well as use
concealer to prime my eye
next I'm gonna go ahead and take a light
brown shadow and this is a morphe e23
and I'm just gonna pack this all over
I'm taking a deeper dark and just
packing on the outer corner and then a
light shade just to sweep over
everything to make sure it's nice and
blended I'm gonna go ahead and repeat
the same steps underneath the eye next
I'm gonna go ahead and create a winged
liner I'm gonna create a nice dramatic
wing as you're able to see it even when
I put on my lashes
and I'm gonna go ahead and pop on the
lash I'm gonna go ahead and do some
contouring and I'm gonna go ahead and
apply a little blush now for a nice skin
glow I'm gonna go ahead and take my ELF
daily hydration moisturizer and a sponge
and to supply it to the areas where I'm
gonna highlight and I'm going to take
elf in heart defense collab and this is
a brush BH Cosmetics and it's my ray-ray
and I'm gonna use this to highlight it
has banana powder on the back of it
we're gonna ignore that
okay so as you guys can see this look is
extremely simple something's missing
obviously the lips but I kept everything
really nice and simple the eyes are a
kind of mixture of a warm and cool toned
Brown just to keep it very neutral
simple wing a simple lashes simple brows
even with the highlight I kept it very
toned down and with the blush I also
kept it very toned down and that's
because when I do this with my
complexion and my eyes I'm able to
literally slap on it whatever lip color
that I want lip finish I could do a
liquid lipstick anything I can use
anything because it's so simple and
neutral so I'm gonna go ahead and show
you guys a few lip options so first up
we have me this is the velvet lip glide
and this is La Maine blue it's so pretty
I want to keep it on I don't wanna pop
all the other colors I'm gonna show you
guys but I mean we must move on but this
so pretty next color we're going to line
our lips with the mariachi's lip liner
and then we're gonna go ahead and put on
the velvet lip glide in the shade number
54 on top and I said that's intense very
slow don't know why I'm glad it's a fast
because have time again stands out
saying okay very nice classic red very
nice and vibrant next you have another
bubble applied and this is bound and
this is for my more simple don't want to
bold color it want something really nice
and sweet this is for you and then for
my more bold people and you guys lived
for this lip color on Instagram you
could not figure out what it was and
honestly I could have told you but I
just I don't know I just I like the
suspense this is also by NARS and this
is their power matte lip pigment in the
shade rock with you and then if you want
to add a little bit more cuteness to the
look you can go ahead and add an eyes
stamp and this from milk makeup and it's
in the heart shape because we're in
February obviously someone go ahead and
just pop this on okay so here you guys
have a finished look let me know what
kind of look you're doing for
Valentine's Day or just February I
didn't want to like make it too
Valentine me because not everyone has a
Valentine and not everyone celebrates it
but we're going to incorporate some cute
little hearts for the sake of February
that is it for this video thank you
again NARS for sponsoring it if you guys
want to see anything else let me know
and good speedier thumbs up and I have a
lot of energy as you can tell and I'll
see you guys in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
