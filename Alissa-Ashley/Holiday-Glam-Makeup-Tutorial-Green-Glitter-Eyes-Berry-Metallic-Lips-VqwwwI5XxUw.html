see
I know I've been kind of gone a little
bit the last couple of days really not
posting as much and that's because I
honestly just needed a break
honestly sometimes you just need a break
because you're gonna go crazy so I just
need to chill down a little bit also you
follow me on snapchat and Instagram and
Twitter basically every other media you
guys know that I just adopted two
kittens so I've been trying to just care
for them and make sure they feel at home
and all that stuff which they do because
they're so bad but I just want to make
sure they're okay and I'm just being
relaxed a little bit but now I'm back
and I filmed this glam look for you guys
it is very holiday and yeah it's not
really much of a I really had to explain
much to the look it's just holiday glam
look and I just feel like how it turned
out some of you guys liked it as well
and if you do be sure to give it a
thumbs up and let me know in the comment
section down below what else you guys
want to see but without further ado
let's just go ahead and jump into this
tutorial and I hope you guys enjoy it
okay so the first thing we do is go
ahead and take this tart shape tape
concealer why I grab my phone I'm grab
my mirror and I'm gonna go ahead and use
this to prime my eye I'm gonna play this
out with this morphe brush if you bought
the e 27 in the brush bootcamp videos
you use that but I just have this one on
hands I'm using this it's a synthetic
blending brush let me go ahead and
lightly set you have the brow bone not
so much the crease and lid area but just
on this little area right here next
ticket this NARS I picked this is
Mozambique and obviously I have been
loving on this all year I've used it
like at least for other tutorials I'm
taking this morphe 17 go ahead just
place this right on my lid area I'm
gonna carry it into my crease as well
and then once I kinda have that amount
that I want on my eye I'm wiping off the
excess on the back of my hand and I use
that same brush to blend it out next
taking this morphe m41 one and this is
the Kat Von D shade
+ light eye and this is in the shade
shade shade sage shade sage it's so hard
to say that you try saying it this is
this is what it looks like I'm taking
this green this really nice beautiful
green and we'll go ahead and pack this
onto my lid
and once I get to that little outer rim
I'm taking the little tip of this brush
I'm just going along it to make sure I
get a very even line and no harsh you
see I'm doing I'm basically softening it
up and I'm taking the m4 112 and just
using that blank and then just further
blending that color up and then taking
this morphe 35o palette I'm taking this
shade right here make sure you guys
taking this shade right here because it
has like a little it's not green but
it's not yellow either it's kinda burnt
whatever emotion that is so I felt like
ill pair really nicely with this green
and not take away from the green as I'm
taking the info 112 and flushing that
right on top because see how it's not
super yellowy it's not super orange it's
almost like a kind of a forest II vibe
to it and that's what I want and then
going back into the shape plus light
taking more of that forest II green or
just to make sure I have a nice even
blend next I'm taking my Mac mixing
medium liner and placing a little bit on
the back of my hand and then taking my
Mac makes a medium liner and this Ruby
kisses concealer brush but go ahead and
take this Mac glitter but pack it onto
my lid
now go ahead and apply a quick coat of
mascara and then for lashes these are
Lily lashes and style tease it's like
ice let them dry looking more for my
base I'm taking this Mac strobe cream
and this is peach light
I've normally been using gold light but
I just want to try this one too and then
for foundation I'm taking this NARS all
day luminous weightless foundation and I
don't know I've just been really liking
it lately I used to love it and then I
just you know like I just kind of find
other foundations but I've been
gravitating towards this again lately so
we use that this is a morphe brush from
one of their little collections
for conceal I'm taking my heart-shaped
tape concealer I'm sure that wasn't
shocked or whatsoever
let me go ahead and quickly set this my
Laura Mercier powder
that must address my face must support
micro smooth powder and by the way this
is a NYX brush it's number three mix-ins
on my Laura Mercier
before pinch in the face I'm gonna go
ahead and finish off the bottom by I'm
going to take that in ours I paint and
this is a makeup geek brush it is the
pencil brush I'm gonna place that in the
little under eye area waterline
then taking that Kat Von D shade + light
and placing that green on top and then
taking that shadow from the morphe 35o
palette and soughing it out for my
contract taking my NARS Jena blush and
this is the morphe form
go ahead and just warm up my skin
I never Bluff have taken our seduction
blush because nice and berry toned for
highlight I'm starting with my cover FX
drops and these are one of these these
are sunlight
and then directly on top of that I'm
taking this Mac show gold extra
dimension skinfinish and this is a
morphe y 14 they're releasing this
collection on I believe Black Friday and
if my lip color I'm gonna take this
Milani pretty problematic and this is
one of their more matte metallic
lipsticks
and then right in the center I'm taking
this Mac pigment I don't on the name by
heart but it'll be in the description
bar I'm not flicking you guys off but
this is my only finger that's like
broken so it helps so here's the
finished look clearly extremely holiday
glam and hope you guys like it I like it
