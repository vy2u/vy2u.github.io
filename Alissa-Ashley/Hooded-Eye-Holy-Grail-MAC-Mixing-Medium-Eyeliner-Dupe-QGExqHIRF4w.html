right now and it's for good reason
someone on Twitter asked me if I ever
heard of the NYX multitasker mixing
medium I was like no but it's an
interesting because I have been using a
Mac makes a medium eyeliner for quite
some time I mention it in my hooded eyes
students don't sin that video has over a
million views
so I'm sure that a lot of people have
went out and bought it I mean they told
me they would've bought it and it worked
out amazingly for them but for whatever
reason it's been out of stock on Mac
site as well as in store for quite some
time I'm really fearful that maybe
they're just taking it off the shelves
and not selling anymore so I have been
trying to find a dupe
why is sale beauty huh sorry you guys
it's good email are you for why is so so
cool okay that's so amazing
anyways I've been trying to find a dupe
for it and I thought that the NYX
glitter primer would be a good one but
it was to a thick and consistency and
the thing that's amazing about the
mixing medium is that it is very very
thin and it doesn't alter the texture of
your products too much it just really
packs it on and it makes it stay all day
baby a vibrant does not transfer and
that's why I love it and that's why it's
one of my hooded eye holy cows and I
just it's just been hard on here for a
pimp because I am trying to save mine
because I really can't find it anywhere
else so today I'm going to do one eye
which is why look so naked on the lids
one eye with a Mac makes a medium
eyeliner and the other with the NYX
multitasker makes a medium just
see if the mixing medium from Nicks is
comparable to the Mac one and the next
one is I believe seven dollars and the
map one is about 1213 dollars so not
only is it more affordable but I'm
hoping that it compares so that can
recommend to you guys so okay so here is
what they look like and let's just get
some up-close shots as you can see
they're pretty similar and consistency
in the sense of they're both really thin
a little transparent so now we've got to
see how they work all right on the
medicine man line of words that's my dog
we got to see how this Nick stuff works
so let me just go ahead and grab a
pigment of choice I don't know I'm
wearing today okay so for this
experiment I'm going to use the code
rain downtown eyeshadow let me just go
ahead and bring you guys a little bit
closer so you guys can see each other
show so you guys can see the action then
okay so I brought you guys in closer to
the action and I might go ahead and take
my Mac mixing medium eyeliner first just
because I know how that works and
squeeze too much and please excuse my
hand I'm got a lot going on but this is
how much I'm going to take of the mixing
medium eyeliner and I'm going to take
this brush this is from Ruby cases is
there concealer brush I love using
concealer brushes to apply my pigments
they're just my favorite and I'm just
going to take a little thin layer place
it all over the lid
and don't look up and I'm just gonna
take the shadow rub into the shadow and
just pack it right on top and I'm going
to seal it in place with a nice thin
layer of the mixing medium I'm gonna let
that dry I'll be right back and now
we're going to try it the NYX one and I
clean up my brush and everything and if
you guys hear me screaming I'm sorry
favor needs attention right now so she
is just going crazy down there I could
take the same amount but let's see about
this much it's a little bit more frosty
than the mixing medium but I have high
hopes for it but take a thin layer it's
a little bit more thick I'm noticing
that Rob the bat I'm gonna take a thin
layer give my pigment place on top okay
so it's a little more thick it's not
picking up as well as the mixing medium
but we're we check to see it's a little
more thick a little more thicker and
dies a little more fast so maybe I set
to work a little bit faster
and then we go ahead just seal it in
place a little bit just like how I get
the Mack mixing medium I'm going to let
that dry and be right back
okay so off-camera I was kinda just
reflecting and I think that with the
next one it's best to apply it with the
fingers and I did a little bit of like
testing on the back of my hand
and it seems like the product lends a
little bit better when using the fingers
and not the concealer brush but so far
it's not transferring whatsoever let me
go ahead and just do my lashes my scare
and stuff and I'll be right back okay so
far no transferring whatsoever is
happening and I am excited because I
think I really did find I do so now the
true test is to see how it wears
throughout the day I do have an event to
go to so I'll be out of these creeks and
against the natural element of the
weather and we're going to see if
anything happens and I'll bring my blog
camera to see it me and then goes down
so I'll be back with you guys a couple
hours probably is better lighting better
okay see you guys it's been about two
ish hours for shopping and much much
enticing the for you guys I'll go
outside too but so far no transfer Xbox
five senses get better but like I didn't
want to forget to update you guys go
check them in
see how it's wearing just the nick site
it's not transferred see that let's see
it's been about two and a half hours or
so and I'm like updating for both the
videos I'm filming today but about two
and a half hours and still is worn off
this lighting is but yes get the
point
am i checking about another two hours
okay so I am back at home it has been a
couple of hours and I don't know the
exact time I had to take my camera but
it's been quite some time and the next
one is definitely going to be doomed a
dupe or it's going to be called ado
because it definitely is I experienced
zero transfer whatsoever this is the
next slide this the Mack mixing medium
liner I zero transfer you guys have to
trust me I did not touch up anything I
literally got home came back in here to
show you guys a result there was no
transferring the only thing that I would
point out about the NYX multitasker
makes a medium is that it's a little bit
thicker than the Mac one so I feel like
it's better to apply your pigments or
shadows with your fingers with the Mac
one I can get away with using a brush
and maybe actually to find a better
brush to apply the next one and you guys
will see that in future tutorials
because I do want to use that one now
just because it's able to be purchased
like the Mac one but I feel like the
finger will probably work better but
other than that both of them look the
same it did not change the consistency
of the product that I thought it would
because the NYX glitter glue primer it
did that so it was a little unfortunate
but this one worked out pretty well so
I'm really excited I found it tube and
if you do decide to pick it up let me
know how it works for you again you guys
know how it go by my Mac makes a medium
liner so I'm pretty excited to start
using this one out because I feel like
this is definitely gonna become one of
my hooded eye holy grails but other than
that thank you guys so much for watching
I hope you guys like this low comparison
and you want to see any more be sure to
let me know and I'll see you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
