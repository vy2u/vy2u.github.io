you're probably thinking what the hell
is going on in today's video I am going
to share with you guys some tips to
improve your makeup game grant it this
fight looks really dramatic because I
combined a bunch of makeup mistakes on
my face so yeah not everyone's walking
around looking like this but there are
certain mistakes that people do make
when it comes to their makeup and I want
to go ahead and give you guys my tips on
how to improve them because that's what
I'm here for
so if you guys want to see that then
just keep on watching because I want to
change it so bad so I want to go ahead
and get started ok first things first
as you guys can see I have my highlight
underneath my eyes and you can see right
here it's like a harsh not SuperDuper
harsh it's a really harsh little divider
from here to here and it also isn't just
it's just not marrying well my entire
face because this is so bright and under
here is just darker so I'm gonna go
ahead and show you guys tip number one
if you do happen to run across this
problem what you want to do is you want
to take a powder with a tint with it my
favorite to do this trick is the Sephora
micro suit powder and this is my morphe
58 if you do not own this brush it's a
great brush and we're gonna use it again
you guys will see later on because this
brush is just so helpful when it comes
to fixing makeup mistakes as well as
just making a very flawless base I'm
gonna go ahead and just dip it to the
powder like so and what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna slowly buff under my eye area
to tone it down as well as get in here
as you can see just by doing that all
right it's smoothing the max move over
it it got rid of that line so you just
want to smooth I make your eye and as
you can see it also smooth over the
blush
so it's honed that down a bit and I'm
gonna go ahead and just keep up and get
on as you can see the micro smooth also
went over the blush so now that's not as
a tense so now we're gonna go ahead and
reapply it and we're also going to go
ahead and soften out this contour I'm
gonna take the same a brush same powder
and just go over our contour bit I want
to provide these tips for people who
already have their makeup on and they're
just okay
like maybe this look better this is what
you can do these are easy fixes that
literally take seconds and it just
improves your makeup so I'm just buffing
over the contour what the micro smooth
and as you can see it's toning it down
see how this side is a little more harsh
yeah it's toning it down completely next
for my contour I'm gonna go ahead and
take the morphe four and I'm gonna take
my Too Faced dark chocolate Soleil
bronzer and I'm gonna go ahead and just
show you guys how I apply my contour to
avoid getting a really harsh line I'm
gonna dip into the powder dust it off
and where you want to start with the
contour is right here you never want to
start down here and drag it up you want
to start right over here near the ear
and kind of bring it down a bit I like
to go in circular motions so I never get
a sharp line and then with your blush
and then go ahead and just tap into my
blush just it off and I like to apply my
blush about right here I don't like to
do the apples on the cheeks because I
just I just don't like the look of it I
mean you can that's fine but for my face
personally I feel like whenever I put it
round the apples it Katyn and make me
look a little more round and I don't
want to look like some Mari like a
little blonde blueberry so I'll go ahead
and apply it right here just look have a
soft color on the cheek without do it
too much it's very subtle and then for
the nose as you can see I have a really
intense nose highlight and my contour on
the nose is very sharp so what we're
gonna do I'm gonna take my Sephora micro
smooth again and my morphe 58 tap into
it and what you want to do is you wanna
go on the edge of the nose and as you
can see going on the edge soften that
line and that's what we want or also
them go over the highlight just to tone
it down
now as you can see on my eyes I have on
these extremely large latches they're
really uncomfortable and I am so excited
that I'm gonna take them off to show you
guys how to properly apply them with
lashes I feel like a lot of people
forget that you're able to cut them and
customize them based on your eye shape
they just take them out the lash
container and they put them on their
eyes and you end up getting this really
unflattering long or elongated lash and
it just just kind of makes the eyes look
downward and you don't want to do that I
thought the purpose of lashes is to like
lift and open the eyes sometimes they
are too kind of close them up to be more
smokey but the main purpose should be to
lift them and not make your eyes look
droopy so I'm going to take the last and
same exact lash and watch how different
I make it compared to this what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna take my lash
tweezers you can get these from Ulta I'm
gonna apply the lash on to my eye and as
you guys can see I'm gonna go ahead and
apply the lash right here and I have a
lot of extra lash left so I'll move it
around and that is where I'm going to
cut from because this part of the lash
the outer part usually has most of the
the flare so I feel like when you cut
the inner part you're getting rid of
some of the last shape so you want to
cut from the outer if you can and
sometimes I do go on the inner part but
I mainly like to star in the outer part
when it comes to cutting my lashes so
I'm just go ahead and look at the lash
see where it's sitting as you can see we
have all this extra lash so I'm gonna go
ahead and cut off that part gonna put it
on one more time and see if I cut it to
my liking okay I think that is gonna
look great I'm gonna go ahead and apply
some mascara first my favorite lash glue
or lash glues are the callous eyelash
adhesive you can get this at Namie's and
it's about like eight bucks it's really
really cheap and then also the house of
lashes clear lash glue I'm allowing the
glue to dry you want to make sure that
the glue is
nice and sticky so you do not want to be
wet and slippery otherwise that can lead
to your lash kind of coming off on the
corners because it just wasn't ready it
can lead to just a mess it can mess up
your eyeshadow so you just want to make
sure that that lash glue is nice and dry
it down for at least a minute and then
if it is right down it's going to be way
easier to apply this workout low-key not
gonna lie to you this is a workout okay
our lashes on as you can see it looks
much better it fits my eye it's not
hanging off the side and it just looks
much more flattering and then just
applying the lash without customizing it
to your eye shape especially they put it
eyes you definitely have to do this
because I was so small and most lashes
that are sold are super super long so we
have to customize them now let's go
ahead and address this crazy-looking
brow I'm gonna go ahead and show you
guys how to fix that as well first
things first the concealer the highlight
it is way too intense so I'm gonna take
a morphe 27 brush and I'm gonna go ahead
and just slowly blend it out just
blending it to soften it and then with
the same brush as you can see this is
very very intense right here so I'll go
ahead and just slowly brush it away
and then for the part that's not buggy
I'm gonna go ahead and just take my
figure now that that's dull down and
we'll go ahead and show you guys how to
make it look more natural I'm going to
take my Mac 2 6-3 brush and my eco brow
in the shade Rita you can use this
technique with a brow pomade a powder
anything will do even a pencil I'm gonna
go ahead and create little brow like
hair like strokes not brow like strokes
hair like strokes on my brow and then
since this is a more intense lash I do
wanna balance out my eye because just
this and this it's just too much going
on so to balance that out I'm gonna go
ahead and apply a brown shadow to my eye
I'm also going to apply that same brown
shadow to the bottom just to complete
the eye look because you want your eye
look to be even and I feel like whenever
you apply it the same Shh at the bottom
as you do to the top for most look
especially everyday looks it just looks
much more cohesive and put together and
lastly because we're still looking crazy
because it's freaking lip color
the best way to improve your lipstick
especially if you're wearing a nude
especially if you have a little bit more
melanin especially if you have a little
bit more melanin because I find that a
lot of new shades tend to look crazy
like this if you kind of are a little
bit deeper in complexion you want to go
ahead and apply a brown lip liner or
brown liquid lipstick since this is a
liquid lipstick formula I'm naturally
gonna take a brown liquid lipstick to
blend it together but if you are wearing
just a regular lipstick formula a brown
lip liner will do just as good
and now as they go ahead and top it all
off with some highlights and to do that
I'm just gonna take my morphe Y 14 and
this is Laura Geller gilded honey and
I'm just gonna pack it right here now
let's go ahead and just match this side
to this side so you guys get the full
effect and the last tip I want to give
is to apply your setting spray and set
your face before you do your bottom lash
mascara especially if you are rushing
out of the house you do not want to make
this mistake because if you do your
bottom lashes and then you set your face
it's gonna get ruined so let's go ahead
and just set our face we're gonna it dry
and if you don't have time to let it dry
just take the flat part of your sponge
if it has one or just any sponge and
push the setting spray into your face
and then lastly we can go ahead and
apply our bottom lash mascara and then
here you have the final phase so that is
how you can improve your makeup and I
really want to do it in this style
because I want to show you guys that you
don't have to wash off our makeup to
then to start over and fix the mistakes
you can literally do it and just start
from where you currently are you not I
mean like you can just have a mistake
and you say okay that's that's kind of
looking a little bit crazy
some use Alyssa's tips to improve it
because not everyone has time to sit
there and have to wash up the face to do
all over again to make a mistake so
those little tips and tricks that you
can use to improve your makeup I hope
that they were helpful and I hope you
use them if you do happen to make these
makeup mistakes if you like this video

let me know what else you guys would
like to see to help you
would you make up name but other than
that thank you guys so much for watching
