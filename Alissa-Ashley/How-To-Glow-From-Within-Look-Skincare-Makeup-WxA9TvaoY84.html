getting the Olli Henrickson peered
through youth activating oil it's orange
pile it in my face good to go
see I added like a tint to me that's
fine it just I don't know to me it adds
so much radiance and I love it
let me put the cap back on so doesn't
spill and then was that a towel into my
face I've got to take the Olli
Harrington banana bright eye cream and
this thing is so cool
I put it on yesterday and then literally
brightened my under eye so let me open
it look come on I got put the camera
down I got a lot on my hand but I'm
gonna go ahead and just apply it under
the eye okay so we are good to go on
skincare I probably have lint all over
from my towel but we're good to go on
skin care and then for my last step I'm
gonna go ahead and pawn this viga brow
serum
go ahead and just apply that rule my
brows out all right so my skincare is
done I got some banana cream on my
camera but now that we are done with the
skin let's go ahead and jump into the
studio and we're gonna get that make it
look firstname ado let's go ahead and
take my Sicily primer because it's my
favorite primer and the whole wide world
but you can take whatever primer you
want preferably one that's comic more
like illuminating and not mattifying so
you can get that glow next for
foundation I'm mixing two today I'm
going to mix my 50 Beauty Pro filter
foundation and the Laura Mercier candle
glows soft luminous foundation this in
the shade pecan and this in the shade
370 shake them both up a little bit get
them nice already and I'm gonna pump out
about two pumps of a Laura Mercier about
this much and a little bit of math into
beauty and I'm mixing the two because I
love the finish of both and also like
I'm going to get my color so this gives
me like over the
Jade
next I'm taking the color pop no filter
concealer in the shade 10:50 and I'm
gonna go ahead and use this to highlight
we are no timeout so we are now be quiet
really quickly and I'm gonna go ahead or
not shut up and I'm gonna go ahead and
are now imma go hot bombs but Nana
powder y'all okay go ahead
now I'm gonna go ahead and take my
Sephora micro smooth movie and I'm gonna
take my morphe e-50 this is a 51 I named
got my 58 my a 58 and I'm gonna go ahead
and just apply that to my face I cannot
find my a 38 I'm gonna take the e 50 or
actually 34 and the reason behind all of
you guys noticed when I was kind of
speeding through I was using the sponge
to press in the powder and not even
using the brush cuz I just want them to
sink into my skin and I'm just I go
ahead and tap this lightly over the rest
of my face normally I would do a bunch
of powder everywhere if I only did it
over on my mouth area cuz I like that
area to be bright because it gets a
little darker and then I use the micro
smooth to kind of tap away the rest of
my face just like this now I'm gonna go
ahead and do my brows off-camera I do
have a brow video coming for you guys
which is why I don't wanna we see time
so we go ahead and do my brows off
camera and I be right back okay so the
brows are done I'm gonna go ahead and
take my color pop no go-to concealer
this concealer is my gym if I haven't
said that yet
this concealer is my gym I wanna say
this is like my most favorite concealer
that has come out this year I literally
emailed them I said hey like you guys
send me war ten fifty and they're like
yeah and then send me three of them and
I am obsessed like I love this stuff I
love it so much the color of it hashtag
no ad but like I wish I was like if they
were to say hey listen we want you to
sponsor our concealer for a year like
hell yeah cuz I'm gonna do it anyway I'm
gonna wear this anyway I love this stuff
as you can see I'm just patting it into
my I just priming a little bit as you
can see I did not conceal under my eye
cuz I want a soft look today and I feel
like by doing that it just kind of adds
more of a super glam look okay I don't
want that and then taking the color
train of beauty rust palette I'm gonna
take the shade natural which is a very
very very soft brown and this is a dose
of color it's blending brush one of my
favorites and I'm just going to apply
this to the crease area
just a flush of color
switching over to a more PG 12 I'm
taking a shame shame shame see same
shade I'm gonna pop it underneath okay
so now I'm gonna go ahead and step away
from my eyes I want to do the rest of
the face because I'm gonna do my mascara
and stuff last because I'm gonna be
using sprays and I do not want to get
like raccoon eyes so we're not gonna do
that I'm gonna go ahead and start by
bronzy I'm gonna take this mark Mar fee
I can't talk today ever take this morphe
are 10 and this is my Chanel powder that
I'm obsessed with because it's just so
warm and there's a piece of lint to my
nose I'm kind of glad and freaking do
this okay I haven't talked
but we're gonna bronze up the face warm
it up a bit as you can see I'm very
being very sloppy with this not too
precise I just want it warmth I want you
to look at me and be like wow is that
the Sun I'm big no Sun's up there look I
look really warming good that's what I
want but a little bit on the nose we're
not going with a super detailed nose
contour we're just going with a flush of
color on the nose today then taking on
more feet 51 I'm just gonna smooth that
out
for blush I'm going to take this lip and
cheek from milk makeup it's in the shade
Bradley and I love this because it's
like the perfect pinky shade
all right house on my hand and we go
ahead and apply this to our cheeks see
it's alright giving me a nice glow they
look all nice and glowy and happy that's
what we want and I'm taking this nyx
bright idea illuminating stick and I
like this cuts more orangie and I live
for like a nice orange blush I'll rub
this on my hands and pop that right on
top cuz see how I just looks even
brighter and like just so happy I love
this for this combo I should say the
highlight you can see on this side how
like illuminating it is I just I love
looking very nice and fresh and these
sort of blushes give me that look I'm
gonna go ahead and take this beautiful
bottle and this is the Sephora
perfection mist new glow it's basically
a do we missed and I'm gonna shake it up
a little bit I'm gonna spray that on the
sides of our face as well as the
forehead it's best to like I'm gonna
bring it back and then just spray an
even amount versus coming really close
to not go really close cuz they may burn
your makeup because that's too close up
this I like right here
that's good or head and taking the flat
part of this sponge and I'm just gonna
press it in very lightly you do not want
to be blending because then it will
remove your makeup and then I'm not
gonna add highlight because as you can
see the blush and the spray are you did
that for me but I am gonna add hi to the
central part of my face because I just
like that to pop more and I'm gonna take
the Finn T Beauty kilowatt and this is
hustla baby and mean money and I'm gonna
take let me open it up I'm gonna take
what is this hustler baby and I'm gonna
pop this on my nose and my Cupid's bow
now I'm gonna go ahead and apply my
mascara for lips I'm going to take my
collaboration gloss with elf I've been
trying not to use it because I know it's
sold out and I feel bad but don't worry
it's coming back and that till you guys
win yet but it's coming back so I want
to use it because I've been dying to use
it but I didn't want to make you feel
like okay she's using it but where the
hell is it you know what I mean I don't
know if like that's kind of like that's
mean
so no wear it that's perfect for this
look and then for the last and final
step I make them on lashes but I forgot
my lashes in here so I can't do anything
right now but I want to show you guys
how to top off this extremely nice and
glowy look I'm gonna go ahead and show
you guys a trick that I love doing
whenever I'm on my skin to look very
very skin-like I'm gonna take this elf
daily hydration moisturizer this
specific moisturizer is my favorite when
it comes to doing this because it's just
perfect not too thick not too thin not
too oily not just it's just perfect so I
highly recommend this one you can try
your lotion at home but this one is my
gym I love this stuff now go ahead and
pump o me get some flush from the back
of my hand off and we go ahead and pump
this on the back of my hand about this
much then we're gonna spread it like so
just like that
and I'm gonna take my sponge the flat
part I'm gonna dip it into there make
sure it's nice and coated and I'm to
apply that to my makeup we're gonna work
our way across the whole face
very gently I'm not guys do the nose as
much because that part gets oily let me
do the rest of my face not the center
part my forehead that around it and I go
ahead and set our face with our more
Beach setting spray and then for the
last step I'm gonna add a little bit of
shimmer to the lips using this color pop
gloss and this in the shade of charming
and then this last step is optional
however I like doing it whenever my nose
has little bumps as you can see I'm
breaking off from something not sure
what and maybe cuz I changed my diet my
body's just adjusting but whatever the
case may be I like to do this step to
come out distract from that I'm gonna
add some both freckles using this Stila
and this is the stay all day waterproof
brow color and this is a shade medium
warm and I like this cuz it's the
perfect freckle color from my skin tone
because it's warrant a cool tone at the
same time because if it's too cool tone
it's a little weird too warm may look a
little weird it's like the perfect
freckle color
okay so that is it for this look I hope
you guys like how it turned out I hope
it was helpful if you guys liked it be
sure to give it a big thumbs up and let
me know what else you guys want to see
for this week because we are back to
daily uploads Monday through Friday
maybe Monday through Thursday cuz I
don't think you guys like my Friday

really do as well but we will see but
other than that and you guys so much for
