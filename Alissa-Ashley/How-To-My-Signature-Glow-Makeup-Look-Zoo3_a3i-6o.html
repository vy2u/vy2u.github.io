today's video is going to be on this
look that you see right here I wore it
to gym beauty and you guys were like so
here for you were so here for the glow
and you guys really want to know how I
achieved it as well as just just a whole
look so I decided to go ahead and film
for you guys because I film what you
guys asked for so if you guys want to
see how I achieve this glowy look then
just keep on watching
and if you want to see anything else let
me know in the comment section down
below
other than that hope you guys enjoyed
this video and I will talk to you guys
later let's get started okay so the
first thing I'm going to do is go ahead
and take this skin Inc pure serum mist
now kind of using it as a primer of
sorts because it's very hydrating and I
want my skin to be very hydrated I'm so
sit here and wait for my skin to really
take that in next I'm going to take this
Mac strobe cream and it's the hydra
hydra pronounce that it's hydrating
according to this name and it's called
gold light and it's just going to really
add a nice golden um aura to my skin for
foundation I'm taking two foundations
and these are ones that you guys are
familiar with because I always break
them out during the winter season
they are the George Almighty luminous
silk foundation and the YSL the tint to
shake lot I am doing another cheap dues
for high-end video and I'm going to try
to find dupes for these so do not worry
that will be coming up so I like to take
two pumps of the Weiss L and about one
pump of the George Armani I mix them
because both of the foundations are
great but they don't have my shape so I
just mix them and mix them on my hand
just apply to my face these are great if
you have dry skin
they're so hydrating and they just look
really good
they're expensive but they look good
then go ahead and blend this out my
beauty blender for concealer I'm going
to take my amazing Tarte shape tape
concealer this is my favorite - everyone
has their concealer loved and I think
that this one is just my love right now
I like the fact that it has like a semi
mattified finish you don't use as much
setting powder when it comes to setting
your under-eye which just makes it look
less cakey then I said so make sense
make sense I hope that makes sense
and then to balance out all the
highlights on my face i'ma go ahead and
contour with autist osseous stick
foundation and this in the shade walnut
I'm go ahead and quickly set my under
eye highlights with my Laura Mercier
powder I do have a little bit of the
sauce ship butter cup powder mixed I
bought it when I did another video a
couple months ago so it's still gonna
mixed in there which I don't mind
because adds a yellow tint to it which
kind of works out for my skin tone so
just in case you're wondering why
sometimes my Laura Mercier powder looks
a little bit yellow and then for the
rest of my face I'm taking my Sephora
micro smooth powder and I can mix in my
Laura Mercier as I'm applying this I'm
applying it with my morphe tooth brush
breaking your heart swapping as soon as
you walk out that I panic see I'm never
gonna understand it you saw
for brows i'ma take this Eco brow and
this is in the shade Rita its defining
brow wax I got it at Nene's and I've
been really liking it like a whole lot
it's I would just kind of honestly just
picking up things as I go okay when you
just get this and it's so bomb and this
brow brush is from deeper al gal and I
just yeah I like this brush so I'm go
ahead and do my brows with these two
products and then to further define D
brows I'm going to take this Kat Von D
metal mat now I'm taking the shade oak
because really nice Brown go ahead and
use this to just define the bottom part
of my brow then to clean up my brows as
well as prime the eye I'm taking my
Tarte shape tape concealer
this next part oh let me set my brows
first you almost forgot to set my brows
to set my brows imma take this Aiko brow
gel style and define it has a tint to it
which is what I like about it the next
step is super simple I'm going to take
the Kat Von D shade + light contour and
I'm taking the middle shade in the deep
shade and this is the morphe in by 14
and I'm just going to go ahead and just
flush this color right into my crease
area and let me take the metal matte
palette I'm take the same Brown shall I
use the brows just to deepen it up a
little bit
for my eyes I'm gonna take my Mac mixing
medium a liner and this dose colors
ideal duo
and this in the shade limit drop
not for my brow bone I know I said that
this cleaning base isn't good for the
lid because it will make it crease but
the brow bone is okay so I'm taking this
in one57 the same person use for the lid
but I forgot to mention and I'm going to
take the cream base of the lemon drop
make sure it's nice and even on the
brush I'm just going to pop this into my
brow bone and I'm going to take the
pigment on the bottom and place that
right on top
empty that same cream place in my little
flabby fold and pop the pigment right on
top
now for the bottom part of my eye I'm
going to take this move my voice I'm
getting sick this is the NYX jumbo eye
pencil and this is a shake cashmere but
pop this in my waterline
and I'm applying a heavy coat of bottom
lash mascara using the it cosmetics
superhero mascara
you
and then for my lashes I'm taking Lily
lashes in the style Miami and I've just
been wearing these non-stop so good balm
okay so now moving back to the skin to
get into the glow I'm going to take this
makeup wrapper Pro bronze fusion and
this is number 35 I and I actually
decided to try this out after watching
Sondra Gillette's use it for like years
so I really want to try it and this is a
more feat e53
and if I blush I'm taking this right
it's called Flom it's the artistic blush
it's very pretty it reminds me a lot of
NARS Taj Mahal and now for the glow okay
so I'm going to take this cover FX
custom dancing drops and this in the
shade sunlight and I'm going to take the
Beauty Blender that I use to blue now my
conceal and everything right now it's
kind of dry which is kind of what I want
I don't want to be too dry I want to
almost be just almost dry it's so hard
to explain and I'm going to take a
couple of the drops on the back of my
hand like one two and I'm so go ahead
and take my Beauty Blender and just
apply the I'm going to get the product
on the Beauty button and make sure it's
really nice and even and kind of thinned
out nothing too thick because then you
will mess up and imma go ahead and just
lightly apply to my cheek and I want to
say lightly I mean lightly I'm like
literally pouncing it so lightly and I'm
gonna take the makeup forever
pro light fusion and this number two I'm
taking this morphe m50 one brush and i
go ahead and coat the brush i'm going to
pack it on not going to sweep it just
yet because this is a liquidy cream
product you don't want to sleep on top
of it you want to Pat your product on
and then begin sweeping
as you can see when I turn to the side
the highlight disappears and that's kind
of what you want now highlight you don't
want to look like you have a shadow
because that's not what a highlight is
about a highlight is when it's
reflecting off of the light you don't
want shadows on your highlights so this
is what does she look like right now let
me go ahead to the other side I'm gonna
show you guys a little trick dipping it
into the beauty blender
now if you can look right here I'm
trying to look to make sure I'm point
the right thing you can see a clear
divider between my highlight and my
under-eye and I don't like that look so
I'm going to take the cap on D shade +
light contour I'm taking the same brush
that was sent with it I'm going to mix
the banana and the peachy shade I'm just
go ahead and just place it under the eye
and kind of touch on the highlight as
well to kind of blend them both together
can I do that to the forehead as well
just so the highlights are even on my
face and then to really pop off this
glow I might go into that dose of colors
duo the lemon drop take a little bit and
just wait any Amir to see this and just
pop it right on the center
and if in my lip shade I'm taking this
Mac spite lip is it a lip glass or
whether they call it that Mac it's a
gloss okay
spite and on top of that I'm taking this
Kiko Milano and this is their 3d hydra
lip gloss and number 27 and then to set
all this in place i'm going to take
these scandinavia make a finishing spray
and this is the bridal spray so here's a
finished look and I hope you guys like
how turn out just very glowy very glowy
very glowy so yeah I feel like this is
what my signature looks and I feel like
whenever I do something like this you
guys really asked for it so I'm glad I
was able to film it so a lot of noise
being made outsides make me mad but hope
you guys like how it turned out if you
want to see anything else please let me
