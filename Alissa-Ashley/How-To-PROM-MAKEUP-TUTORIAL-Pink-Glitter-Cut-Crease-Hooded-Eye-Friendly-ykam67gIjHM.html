today's tutorial I'll be showing you how
to achieve this nice soft but dramatic
pink cut crease type I I don't really
honestly know it's called as you can
tell just by me stuttering over it but
it's Bom
that's all we need to know okay it looks
good it's gonna look awesome at your
prom
so if you want to see how I cheated just
keep on watching also comment down below
your prom dress color so I can try to
get up some videos to help you look good
with your dress at your prom and all of
this stuff other than that let me just
stop talking so that we can get to the
toriel I will see you guys soon
okay so the first thing I do is just
take my zoeva two to four define crease
brush and cupcake I shot up by makeup
geek and we'll place that all in my
crease area and I like this I shot
because a nice really subtle pink and
just a perfect transition shape for this
I shall look
I'm just going to wing it out just like
that the next thing we do is take my
NARS single eye shadow in the shade no
you're the single eye shadows are pretty
expensive they're $25 each but they do
last a long time and they are very very
high-quality I've had this for about a
year and it still has the same
pigmentation that I had when I first
bought it and I cannot say the same for
some I shop palettes they get you know
dry and you know they expire but the
nourish shadows stay very beautiful I've
had one for two years and still nice and
pigmented so I really like NARS shadows
and I don't want any harsh lines or
anything like that I'm going to take
cerbai which is also from makeup geek I
know my lighting is making it seem very
very pale and it is really pale but not
that pale it's like a really soft pink
shade just to soften everything up a bit
I'm going back in with the New York
shade and just go very very close to my
crease just to make sure that that
shadow is you know the most intense
so we're leave that alone for now and
work on the lid if I could buy my brush
there it is okay so first I'm going to
take NYX jumbo eye pencil in milk I'm
going to take this concealer brush from
look royal royal and langnickel brushes
and I'm just going to clean up my lid
and then I'm going to go directly on top
of this with steel of kiddin eyeshadow
it's the smoothest eyeshadow I've ever
freakin used in my entire life
I'm going to pack that right on top it's
very pretty and very shimmery see how my
lid looks nice and beautiful big winged
out ah so perfect and then on top of
that I'm gonna take my Mac mixing medium
liner just put a really thin layer don't
want to kick it on because then that's
when you know your eyes are soft a crack
and I'm going to take this girl lack to
glitter in these shades champagne and
just pack that on top
well that's drawing I'm just taking some
more New York eyeshadow and my 2p for
Lux smoky shader brush and just really
kind of define that crease little more
you know this is a cut you know it can't
be all subtle I just mess it up but yeah
yeah I just want to make sure that it's
nice and deep in that crease area I'm
just go ahead and apply some mascara I
still don't want to look up all the way
because I feel like it's not 100% dry
and you really want to make sure to dry
now I'm taking Lily lash in the style
Canas and I mentioned before actually I
didn't mention on my channel because the
pair that I have freaking yeah that's a
situation but I did mention on snapchat
and Instagram that I love love love love
love these lashes so I'll just apply
those now go ahead and take that 2 3 4
brush the same smoky shader and just
place the same shadows underneath I'm
going to bring it and kind of like go
underneath my little lean just to kind
of connect it and then when I get to
this little inner corner I'm actually
going to create like a little kind of
opening because I want to keep that open
I don't want to you know just leave it
kind of dull I want to open it and I'm
going to take kitten eyeshadow right in
that little inner corner as well as I'm
a little flappy bold
okay so here the eyes just about done
but I am gonna add some bottom lash
mascara but I want to finish the rest my
face where I do that so let's just zoom
out okay so as you can see I'm having my
foundation highlight my kind of stuff
and believe what I use down below but I
just want to know more time for the eyes
because that's the focus but I'm gonna
go ahead and contour with my black
radiance soft focus powder go ahead and
see the shade of this this isn't a shade
I can't seek on blind Oh milk chocolate
now I'm just taking NARS libertate blush
and while looking a little bit because
you know it's just a really soft blush I
don't want to you know overpower my face
I want to focus beyond the eyes yeah
just a little bit of blush on for
highlight I'm going to take Becca's opal
and it uses a long time I do miss it so
go ahead and apply that and I want to
take a highlight that wasn't super gold
tell him because I want the focus to be
you know the kind of rolls goldish pink
eye so I didn't want to take away from
that so I wants to take a highlight that
was you know more so he listens all at
all but whatever too much I want you
guys to have a milk mustache someone
told me that he for her my feelings go
ahead and put this in my nose to from
lip car I'm gonna take my kiss New York
rose to coffee lid pencil first like
always
I'm going to take NYX liquid suede cream
lipstick in the shape
sandstorm have the mirror like this i'ma
see anything how and the reflections of
plastic I'm just go ahead and spray my
entire face you want to make sure to do
this so your makeup last all night when
you're dancing with whoever you're
dancing with hopefully a good person not
someone's gonna really like or ruin your
night like I did my goddamn prom

but okay and then apply my bottom black
mascara so here's the finished look
