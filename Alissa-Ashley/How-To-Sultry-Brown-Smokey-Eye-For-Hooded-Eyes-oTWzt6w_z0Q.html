today's video is going to be on this
brown smokey eye that you see right here
it's kind of grungy it's really blown
out I'm so here for it and you guys are
very here for it as well because I post
on Instagram and you guys just be liked
it and I decided to go ahead and film it
for you guys this is my safe time
feeling it actually and I just want to
show you guys how I got this look and
I'm just going to just do a little
breakdown and explain why I'm using the
certain brushes and products I'm using
because you guys know that I like to be
really helpful so that is what I'm doing
today and yeah I mean there's not much
explaining to do hope you guys enjoy the
video let's just go ahead get into it
I'm gonna stop talking and yeah hope you
guys like it let's go ahead and get
started okay so the first thing I'm
gonna do is go ahead and take these bite
Beauty multi Stix
I got these shades Coco and uh nice and
nice it's like a lighter brown and Coco
is a deeper brown and I'm gonna go ahead
and take a nice first and then I'm gonna
go ahead and layer cook on top the
reason being is because I want to be
gradual a little bit I want to kind of
start a little bit light and then get
darker if I need to to do this I'll be
taking my morphe e28 brush and this is
what it looks like and I like this brush
because it's small enough to Grilli into
my eye but big enough to blend it's hard
to explain but I like it a lot and it's
also synthetic and I like using
synthetic brushes for cream products so
I'm gonna go ahead and just swirl it
across the product like so I'll go ahead
and apply it directly to the eye
starting on the lid first
and when I get to this outer part I just
push inwards so that I can control it
so I loop this way when I go on the
inner part and so that way my on the
outer part just so I'm not getting it
all over my eye
okay I've had it built up quite enough
now I'm going with the shake Coco which
is deeper
I'll pack that right on top next time
ago on my Sephora Pro warm palette this
what it looks like and I'm gonna take
this shade right here on a morphe y 16
brush and I'm just gonna pack that on
I'm gonna pack first because it's a
cream product I don't want to sweep
across it and potentially like mess it
up and make it look not blended so I'm
gonna pack it off first and then once
it's packed on if it starts weeping a
little bit and I'm gonna go ahead and
take this deeper brown shade right here
and I'm gonna pack this on top I'm not
gonna blend it all the way up because
then I'm still looking a big blob we're
out of my eye I'm gonna stop right about
here and then just kind of work on the
blend so still pack it on and then once
I do that I'll go ahead and just get rid
of the rest of prop in the brush and
then just use that same brush to blend
this out
now I'm gonna go ahead and take this
pencil brushes by zoeva and it's the 230
Lux pencil and I'm gonna take the same
cream and just apply it underneath the
eye
I like this pencil brush goes nice and
small so it's not gonna create a raccoon
eye I'm not going to worry too much
about getting on the waterline so I'm
using a different product for that next
when I go ahead and take cocoa and just
layer that on as well and I'm gonna go
ahead and take the exact same shades and
Lisa for a warm palette and just pack
the Ryan top
and I'm going to take this beautiful
pencil from hourglass this is their
mechanical gel eyeliner and this is
Canyon and I'm gonna pop that in the
waterline and it just makes it pop it's
so so so pretty and we're gonna drop it
a little bit underneath the waterline to
give this grungy look then we're going
to quickly take that pencil brush just
to kind of smooth it out imma go ahead
and apply some mascara
this loud planes flying by but I'm going
to go ahead and just apply my lashes and
these are the clay lashes and style
lucky
while that's is dry and go ahead and
apply my blush I'm taking this NYX blush
palette I'm taking this peachy blush
right here sweeping that on and I'm not
in a super high light mood I want to be
really nice and matte so I'm taking this
shimmery blush right here because it's
gonna add a little bit of shimmer but
not a highlight I can just see how it
like really barely there and then lastly
I'm applying this liquid lipstick and
this is by colored reigns caught nude it
is new
by the time poses video it will be
available to purchase I do have a color
drink
code right here but this is just such a
pretty color like I'm living for it like
the second I saw is there I knew I had
to make a look with you I had to so I'm
gonna go ahead and apply this to my lips
and I'll go ahead and set my face in
place with this makeup forever mist and
fix and the last thing I'm going to do
just to kind of take it to where I want
to go I'm gonna take the Urban Decay
Naked heat pallet taking the shake
cayenne on this dose of colors blending
brush and I'm just flushing over the
entire eye and I know this is the same
color but I don't know there's something
about this color that looks really good
with the whole brown I don't know you
bright you guys prank a hotel but I can
tell it makes a difference
I'll know what it is about that color
but it just it does changes something
then it's like I don't know it makes
look better I don't know don't know I've
described it I may guess we're like okay
it looks the same it just kind of just
it tastes a different level that I like
it so that is it for this look hope you
