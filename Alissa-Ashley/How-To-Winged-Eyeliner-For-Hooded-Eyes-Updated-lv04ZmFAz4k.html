today's video is kind of random I didn't
really plan posting today but I was
bored and I'm gonna life like whenever I
think about taking a break and not
filming I was okay what do I do
I don't got life you know I only have
one friend so I'm just like I don't
really have much of a life
so filming is my life so I was like you
know what just film just fill me a
little hard I'll listen so I decided to
keep it very simple because I'm
exhausted
and I'm tired so I knew that I wasn't
capable of doing a whole look I barely
won some eyebrows almost stopped me well
like you know what no but I decided to
just do my updated winged liner because
you guys haven't asked me for that for
his long spiel up and acts afraid OSHA
for an album that he did not
drop oh my god he's a mess anyways just
by Frank he kind of been asked me for
this for quite some time to do an
updated one and I did it that's why
we're here so if you want to see I'm
hungry so whatever I'm hungry I just get
so goofy but if you want to see how I do
dis lane on hooded eyes then just keep
on watching and also thank you so much
for being here if you are new to the
squad what's good we're so close to 300
Kade and I can feel it it's gonna happen
soon so yeah so I'm working my ass off
forward and I'm just keep doing my thing
so let's just jump into this - how did
it go okay so like my last hooded eye
winged liner video I'm still using my
Kat Von D trooper liner this is my
favorite liner especially for hooded
eyes because of the fact that it's
waterproof it's very very easy to use it
does not it's just not complicated
because I use other liners and I can use
them because I'm kind of a pro but at
the same time I even risk the chance of
messing up with this one it's just a
little bit easy
so first we'll go ahead and open it
obviously and I'm gonna look straight
ahead
just like this
I'm going to mark out my eyes Elise hood
it just like the other video so the
least put it right in this little area
so I'm go ahead and just draw a little
line I'm then going to draw a line going
towards my lash line just because I know
that's where my wing is gonna fall so
I'm just gonna draw just this little
shapes this is what you should have
right now and as you can see when I look
up you can still see those lines and
that's the whole purpose
if you can't see those lines that
probably means is a little bit too deep
into your hood so when you complete the
wing you're not gonna be able to see it
as well so just make sure you can see
those lines next time I go ahead and
just connect the outer part of it
because we all know that that's where
the wing is gonna end just like that and
then the length of your wing is all a
preference but I like mine to be just a
little bit on the medium long side so it
really shows through so imma go ahead
and just draw my wing line when I draw
my wing I don't like to just have a
freehand I actually like to just rest
the back of my hand where the web well
we're part of the hand this is
fake and oh right now I'm hungry okay
I just rested right here in a cup place
my liner I want to be and I'm going to
move just this part of my hand
so I have the most control just like
that and then I go ahead and just do the
same thing I'm gonna bring it lower and
bring on the chin area now because I
need it to be a little bit lower and I'm
just gonna connect not the tip of the
wing because you don't want to start the
tip because there's gonna be too thick
I'm gonna start like midpoint and
connect it to the little box thing I
created on my lid and then we'll go
ahead and just fill this part in see you
again somewhere as you can see you can
still see the wing when I look like this
and that's the whole point
yes okay now let's go ahead and work on
this part of the wing before we flick it
and just let it fly away for months now
go ahead and just kind of just take the
liner and move it along my lash line
just like that starting off very very
thin oh god everything to do that oops
we'll fix it that ever happens just take
a little bit concealer just some morphe
nineteen brush I'm just gonna paint that
away now sometimes your wing could be
visible but it's really really easy to
make this part up here to thick so I'm
gonna look straight ahead and just see
where I want my wing to peek through and
I'm gonna try to avoid going any higher
than about right here right there
because if I go any higher you gotta be
able to see it
good comes in waves I take my concealer
and just clean that up a little bit so
ease it is so don't freak out it's easy
to clean do not worry and now I'm gonna
work on the wing just by completing it
and making it look not so much like a
penguin or something
okay so here's our basic wing and if you
want to be more dramatic work from the
outer part of the wing so that's I'm
going to do right now just going to
build the wing but only working on the
outer part and not the inner part you
stop here by want mine to be a little
bit more dramatic so imma keep building
it up
i'ma go ahead and apply some mascara I
just really need it and some lashes and
okay so here's a wing without any lashes
the I couldn't see it and as you can see
the trick is just to elongate and work
from the outer corner so that you can
still see your wing when you open your
eyeballs because your eyes so hooded so
just work from the outer part and leave
this part the I guess you can say you
got like dip it dip it low so that it
does not cover all your freaking eyeball
no so let me go ahead and plant some
lashes and I'll be right back so here it
is with these dramatic lashes as you can
still see you can see the shape of the
wing and it's not lost because I'm a
boss dipped is us okay some of you guys
learned some new tips go ahead and take
a closer look looks so good
so that is it for this video as you can
see it's really really easy and the main
points to take away are just to make
sure that you are not covering the part
of your eye that is the most hooded
minds over here like I said in my last
video just make sure you're not going
over that because then it's going to get
lost and so really thick and just not so
leaky it also works from the outer part
of the wig not the inner part because
then if you work from the inner part
you're going to get on that part where
your eyes most hooded so just make sure
to do that and I would recommend
practicing with eye shadow just take
some brown eyeshadow do your little
outline make your little box like I did
in that little inner corner area
whatever that was and then go over it
with the Kat Von D to Berliner and or
just any liner that you prefer but I
love this one and you'll be all good
so yeah other than that thank you so
much for watching thank you for being
here if you want to see any other video
please let me know and I'll make it
happen and I will see you guys soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
