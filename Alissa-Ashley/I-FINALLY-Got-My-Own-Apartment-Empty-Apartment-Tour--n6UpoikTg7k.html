am well this is my move-in day to my new
apartment I'm pretty sure you guys
already know that was moving to an
apartment well my first apartment
actually because I have been complaining
about it quite often okay so um I did an
empty apartment tour on periscope but I
decided to do want to here as well you
missed it so yeah let's just let's do it
walk out person kind of you just get
here boy are you guys ready
I have no socks on okay so this is when
you first walk in it's really really
windy right now so it means to make sure
this door doesn't shut slam okay so when
you first walk in and make some that
covering the microphone so I was doing
it last time when you first walk in you
have this closet right here and I'm
assuming it's just like a coat closet
you know like there's a very simple
standard closet so I probably my coats
and anything else that I find to put in
here and then I'm going to walk over to
the left you have my room so what about
my rooms but this is like my sleeping
room
and let me just go to the other end of
it I don't want you guys to see the
window to see where I live so this is
the room and I'm just waiting my bed to
be delivered on my stuff to be delivered
so and then when you walk over here you
have the walk-in closet so it's pretty
cool cuz I have a bunch of shelves and
then even behind the door I have
shelving as well so pretty big closet
I'm excited about that because it will
inspire me to up my wardrobe it gets new
clothes and then okay so this is kind of
like this is this little entry right
here show you guys that and then you
walk over here and you have one of the
bathrooms on the light so this is one of
the bathrooms that's me in the mirror so
I really love this bathroom because it
has double sinks so that's pretty cool
so um it's Mike or whoever comes over uh
they could just use one of the sinks and
then one that gave my own personal sink
and then you have the this the bath we
all know what that is I'm so weird and
then I really like this because there's
this door right here when you open it
there's extra little storage space for
like towels and shampoo and all that
stuff that you get when you're living
and try me clean
I don't know I'm saying right now but
you have this extra closet space and
then you walk out and then here is the
living room
since the living room I really really
love the flooring Wow look at you Alyssa
look at you so yeah the flooring have a
window right there as well
so this is the living room it's pretty
spacious so I feel very very obligated
to fill it up what's a nice decor I will
be doing some like DIY stuff for my
channel if you guys want to see that and
then before we get to the kitchen here
is a divider like a wall divider which I
really love because it just kind of
divides the living room from the dining
room and this will actually be my office
space because I want to have a little
space just to kind of really focus and
edit so I plan on putting my desk right
here and like a lamp or something but I
want it to be right here so it could be
right next to my patio I'm not gonna go
out there because it's like privacy
reasons but I can't con just sick it let
me just go out turn on the brightness
I'll just show you guys what it looks
like from right here but obviously for
privacy reasons I don't want to show the
location so and then out here I have
extra little closet thingy for like
suitcases and stuff I'll probably put
that in there let me go back inside now
it's getting kind of cold honestly
okay so before I get to the kitchen
right here is actually a desk space but
I'll probably occupy with like decor and
stuff um just a core because I'm getting
my own desk and then right here you have
another closet let me up the brightness
again you have another closet and this
closet is just more storage space which
is awesome it's really really spacious
apartment with a bunch of extra storage
space and then you have this bathroom
you call the light patent on this one
yep
case you have this bathroom so it is a
2-bed 2bath and just a standard bathroom
I probably won't use one as much this is
why you my guest bathroom and people
come over my non-existent friends I'm
kidding
and this is room number two it has two
windows right here but this is going to
be my filming room where I'll be filming
all of my tutorials and just doing all
the stuff creating magic and that's why
I want a two bedroom because I did need
like an extra space just for filming and
in this is the second closet so it's not
as big as the first one but still pretty
spacious and op I just put extra stuff
in here let's go ahead and go back out
okay and then lastly this is the kitchen
which is my favorite room because it's
just beautiful and I really love how
open it is and you just walk into it
which I really like I like a little
counter because I bought some bar chairs
that go on the up at the side and here's
the sink and just everything and I
really like the fact that these stoves
are gas stoves because I'm used to
cooking with real fire and not electric
so that's really important to me and
then you have the washer and dryer in
unit and little shelving space for like
my laundry soap and little extra towels
so yeah you have that right here and
that is it so there you have it - try
again focus so there you have it that is
my apartment
I am living by myself oh I'm just myself
just me and I want to be that way
I just I'm just like being alone so that
is that one like this I'll just light
out here so the light comes on out here
I just found a switch right here so yeah
so what other thing actually excited
right now honestly I'm very happy just
being my own space finally finally
finally finally I just have so much room
in here and I'm just excited to just
create videos I just really really give
them out and you guys will be seeing a
whole lot of them because I got right
now oh oh it's too bright so you guys
will be seeing a lot of videos and I
mean it's not because I have to make
them because I got bills to pay it's
because I'm really excited to finally be
in a space where I just feel mentally
free so it's gonna make me very happy
and what that happiness comes more
content tint content so I gave it talk
so um yeah I'm just really happy and I
just thank you guys because honestly I
wouldn't be here without you guys and I
know that we youtubers always say that
but I'm being dead ass I'm real about my
 like yeah I'm really happy as you
guys supporting me because well I'll
have my first apartment I'm really
excited about it so
oh it also comes with its own garage so
I get my own little parking space I'm a
little button going there so yeah I am
tired now my mom and my aunt are on
their way to help me with the rest of my
stuff there's something in my eye oh my
god what am i alcohol
