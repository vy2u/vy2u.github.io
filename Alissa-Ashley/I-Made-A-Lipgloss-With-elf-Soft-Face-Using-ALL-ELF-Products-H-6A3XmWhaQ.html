in today's video I am showing you guys
how to achieve this really nice simple
look that you see right here and we got
some nice little soft brows we got some
at scare and no falsies we got some
glowy skin we go what the heck was that
that was a horrible announcement way but
I'm excited and you guys know that I'm
freaking goofy this is my gloss this is
my claws and I collaborated with elf on
this gloss and I don't wanna talk right
now because I am so excited but it's my
gloss on a serious note this is my gloss
gloss see my name it's me and I
collaborated with elf and this is nude
rose lip gloss I have it on right now
and as you guys can tell I can barely
talk I'm super duper excited about it it
launches tomorrow but I'm just so so so
so happy this is my very first collab
and I couldn't have like imagined it
with a better brand because alpha is
awesome you guys do not know that
they're amazing not only are they
affordable but like they're just an
amazing brand let you guys know that you
know there's a lot that happens behind
the scenes and it's like I can just I
can attest that elf is one of the best
friends that I ever even just
encountered in terms of just a
positivity and the message behind their
brand and just how they make people feel
I just love them so I'm so happy that
this is my collab with them you know
like I'm announcing my freakin first
collab so I will ramble too much because
we're gonna go ahead and do the tutorial
and I ramble a little bit later on too
so i won't i won't ramble too much but
just know i'm excited and i thank you
guys for the support because without you
guys this won't even be possible and I
know we always say that as youtubers
with so freaking true and I'm so humbled
and just grateful to have you guys so
yeah it's gotten a serious but if you
guys want to see how to achieve this
look and I did use all elf products so
it's really nice and affordable then
just keep on watching and hope you guys
enjoy it okay so the first thing we do
is go ahead and moisturize my skin's and
I'm gonna do that by using a beet glow
lotion and then I go ahead and just
squeeze them onto my
and I don't know why I'm so inmate it
never go ahead and keep shocking myself
I have so much electrons in here and I
keep shocking myself it makes what a
scream anyways I'm gonna go ahead and
put this on my face while I cry inside I
keep you too late to get it shocked
next for foundation I'm gonna go ahead
and take the shades cocoa and caramel
and mix them together to create my nice
little shade it applies to my skin I
like foundation because it's really like
natural and not like overbearing on the
skin so i'ma go ahead and apply that
because we're going for a really natural
look today mix it up I'm gonna pounce on
to this sponge this from ELF as well and
it's so soft who's who's also go ahead
and blend this in and honestly speaking
I didn't even know about this sponge
like you know just I did it elf collab
doesn't mean I know about all the
products because they're always coming
out with something new I was actually
introduced this sponge by the girls
working at the store they have my meet
and greet I'm like oh have you seen this
fun I'm just like no I have not and I
was like I was like I'm gonna take it
home so they packed it up for me to take
home so I do not have this bunch
it's Betty soft trying to get my blonde
underneath there because I'm not going
with concealer today so I want to make
sure I'm concealing with the foundation
okay to set my face I'm using two
different powders I'm using the perfect
finish HD powder and the beauty shield
antioxidant armored setting powder I
like this one because it has a golden
tint almost like a banana powder so I'm
gonna use this one to kind of highlight
because I did not conceal so that's
gonna act as my concealer my
highlighting my brightening so I don't
look flat
and I'm using this for the rest of my
face see how that's like a yellow tint
to it oh I just drop some apple you guys
he writes like kind of yellowy oh it's
nothing I did not wear the pants I'm not
wearing the pants I plan wear today cuz
like yeah I would have been sad
and I'm not gonna bake by doing up put
some powder underneath to kind of chill
under the eyes I'll set the rest of my
face just to add some more brightening
and then I'm gonna go ahead and take
this powder and kind of sweep it in the
compact and just use this for us my face
now for brows I go ahead and take this
sculpting silk eyeshadow and this is
brown beauty's and I know its eyes shut
up I want to go for a really natural cut
feathered brow today so I do wanna use a
powder and I like this brown in this
palette let me use this Brown at the
edge this one's a shimmer we do not want
shimmer eyebrows now and I'll go ahead
and just kind of lightly fill in my
brows because I want to go for a really
natural brow yeah and then to assist
with the parts I want more definition
right here I'm going to go ahead and dip
into the powder like sooo I'm gonna go
and take this setting mist spray the
brush and I'm going to use that to
create an outline of the brow where I
want more defined
next for the eyeshadow and go ahead and
just make sure there's no foundation or
anything on my lids first and there's
not
I'm gonna take this island breeze little
eyeshadow situation from the Aqua beauty
collection and I'm gonna go ahead why
not just cause situation what am I
talking I'm gonna go ahead and take this
shade right here and I'm gonna go ahead
and just place it on my lid the
situation on my lid and basically my
whole eye basically while I'm saying lid
it's going on the crease to Alyssa also
go ahead take the shimmer shade right
here pop that I'm lid and the thing I
love love love about the Aqua Beauty
line I'm gonna use it for my contour is
that it's like all kind of like it's
aqua you know and I think that that kind
of like situation it just it makes for a
more natural look because as you can see
there's a little bit of definition on my
eyes but it still looks like kind of
skin Mike if that makes any sense so
like it's not super matte and super like
it's more subtle so I don't know I like
that about that a lot I'm gonna go ahead
and take summer breeze and this is a
matte eyeshadow palette matte format and
I'm taking the brown on the end and I'm
gonna place a little bit on the outer
corner as you can see I'm using my
finger because I just want to like
emphasize how simple and easy this is so
we don't have a neat brush for this
little bit under the eye just a little
bit now I go ahead and take this product
and this is the elf active and this is a
new line it's a sweat resistant mascara
and brow duo and I use mascara at my
little meet-and-greet
this is falling down we cannot be nude
on here I use this at my meet and greets
when I give her a little live demo and I
lived for it because I hadn't tried it
before because it's really really new
and I was like I want to take this home
so I did I'm gonna go ahead and use the
little brow gel just to set our powder a
little bit
which is why I did not set it earlier
because this duo's as brow gel too so I
want to wait for it and I'm gonna go
ahead and take the mascara and I'm upon
a coat of that no falsies today I love
love love as mascara because it doesn't
clump the lash together and make some
really nice individual and see how like
it looks like a half lashes and I barely
do and I'm just like wooo I don't really
get that excited about mascara like that
because the fact that I'm always wearing
fake lashes but I don't try this I was
like okay concept because look I'm gonna
have lashes now and I never do I promise
you I never had this much lashes okay so
I was really excited about this a lot
and it's waterproof
but not like a pain in the butt to get
off yay we have lashes now for the
bottom
now I'm going to take one of my favorite
products I use often this is the Aqua
Beauty and this is bronze peach and what
it is it's well used I knew I should
have gone when it's all nice and neat
for just the presentation purposes but I
don't care I love love love love loves
for contouring we're about to do it
right now and this blush is amazing it's
just a perfect combo because you guys
never know when you get like a dual
product and it's like you use one half
of the duo but you just kind of like
leave the other one this you guys to see
they both get little they both get love
and this brush is amazing I use in my 50
Beauty review and a lot of you guys were
okay I'll get that because the way I use
it I'm talking very fast right now
if you're gonna be plated I like to
sweep it into my Korean products oh it's
amazing it's like some genius and I'm
gonna go ahead and just contour it's
like perfect for get in there and then
you kind of just brush it mmm and I love
this product because I mean I like this
about the whole aqua beauty line since
the texture of it it's not matte as you
can see it's like a cream but not too
creamy
it just gives such a nice skin like vibe
to the skin because it's good as you
guys can see it doesn't look like outer
you I look to the side it's not too
harsh because of that aqua beautiness
about it so I like that a lot that's why
I used on my eyes as well the eye shadow
palettes from aqua beauty line as well
because it's nice and natural
and then we're going to dip to the blush
NES and blues so free and then for
highlighter we're taking this and
honestly speaking this is this is
amazing this is a bop as Kenneth will
say he flawless here on YouTube
subscribe his channel this is a Bop and
it is the collaboration with heart and
it is a highlighter and this one over
here is my jam I'm going to put it on
right now so you guys can see go ahead
and take the same little brush it's my
jam it's so beautiful it's so pretty
look at that it's like it's just enough
but not too much I'm about to make it
too much I'm putting on a lot but like
it's gorgeous

burning off the flow anyway were glowing
