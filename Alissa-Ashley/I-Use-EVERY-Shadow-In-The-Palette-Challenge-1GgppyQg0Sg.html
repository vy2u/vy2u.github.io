I'm gonna try to make this in travail
fast life like it look crazy you just
absolute crazy but I decided that I want
to do a video and I want to use a
palette and I want to challenge myself
to use every single shadow inside that
palette this video concept has been done
before I cannot find the originator so
if you guys happen to know let me know
so I can properly credit then I decide I
want to do it because I recently got the
coloured raine cheers to beauty palette
in the mail and I want to care look with
it and I was like what can I do that's
fun and this seems so fun so if you guys
want to see me take on this challenge of
sorts then just keep on watching I hope
you guys enjoy it here is what the
palette looks like and I've used it
before let's go ahead and just kind of
give it a moment I've used it before
mm-hmm but I mainly use the mattes and
sometimes I am SuperDuper intimidated by
shimmer but I'm quite excited because I
love the color range shimmer eyeshadows
a lot I have the single ones so this
should go well let's go ahead and just
get started because I'm so nervous I'm
gonna take powder room first let's start
very neutral and let's just kind of
flush this a little bit over the I just
kind of I don't know and usually I was
gonna start with the shadow and just
kind of see where it goes but I just
really don't know I'm gonna do okay
that's one shadow done I'm gonna try and
do something cool but like I just gotta
start safe man like I don't know what to
do I think I don't know I think I wanna
dude I do okay alrighty I'm gonna first
I hope this comes up good I'm gonna take
the shape opulence which is a nice
shimmery blue and I'm gonna pop this on
the outer part of my eye
kind of wing it out next I'm gonna take
the shade grandeur which is like a deep
green let's apply that next okay
good to go so far next I'm gonna take
the shade nightingale and this looks
like a really really pretty shape to go
right by the green so we're gonna just
trust that do that and I'm gonna go
ahead and take the shade rosy which is
like a yellow gold and pop it right in
here I think so I think that's it work
and then I'm going to take black
butterfly and I'm going to add a little
bit to the outer part of the eye
since this is about eyes off-camera I
might go ahead and just apply my
foundation and everything so we could
finish off the bottom part the eye and I
be right back
cuz it would take me like a long time to
do on camera I think I'm gonna start out
with raise a glass and we're to use this
comes at our soft shade down here before
I figure out what I'm gonna do we're
gonna start with that now I'm gonna go
ahead and take vintage peels which is a
nice orange shade and I might go ahead
and take debonair I hope I'm pronouncing
that shade right and I'm gonna apply
this to the outer part of the eye it's
kind of connect the two by plying that
right underneath I have two more shades
to use I have Banton air or bouncing air
and iconic I don't know where I'm gonna
play iconic ooh
I don't normally fly bounce in the air
we're gonna go ahead and apply bounce me
on the brow bone we're gonna play iconic
I don't know immediately just kind of
wipe onto it
let me see oh that's me hard I don't
know where to put that I think I'm gonna
squeeze it right Oh hmm right here
ya see I'll put it right there and then
I want to show a little bit more love to
iconic and I also want some shimmer
under here so I'm gonna pop that in the
inner corner on the lower part of the
eye and I'm gonna apply a little bit of
black liner underneath just to really
make the eyes more smoky and if you guys
notice in the palette there's like a
highlight shade and I'm gonna go ahead
and highlight with this last shade in
the palette because this counts too and
then for lips I'm gonna take color rain
as well because why not and this is in
the shade Serena's one of those satin
lipsticks with a little bit of gloss
okay so he guys have a finished look and
yeah I used every single shadow and I'm
pretty proud of myself because I was
very very scared but I think that
overall I mean it looks pretty cool is
it everyday wearable obviously not but I
mean I think it's still fun I think
that's a really really fun challenge for
me to try out if you guys like to have a
look turned out or if you guys have
another idea in mind of what you would
have done with this palette and how you
would have finessed all shadows let me
know and maybe do it and tag me in it so
I can see your version of what you would
do but other than that hope you guys
enjoyed this video thank you guys so
much for watching and I will see you
guys in my next video
