might not be the best because I got my
microphone on right now but today's
video is going to be on this look that
you see right here this is inspired by
the new it movie and this is Pennywise
the clown or my creation of it and yeah
I look kind of scary I want to scare my
cats that's me
anyways today it's gonna be a video on
this I know you guys have seen so many
Pennywise videos but I don't give a damn
because this kind of look is trending
right now and I want to personally add
my own little touch on it and yeah I
mean to keep it real I'm trying to make
it to a million and I know that if I do
this kind of video keep it on my
calendar I love me because I'm cool so
you got to do what I do so this is my
first Halloween makeup tutorial
hope you guys like it it'll be not too
scared but if you guys want to see how I
my phone is buzzing everything oh my god
if you guys want to see how I got this
look then just keep on watching and I
hope you guys enjoy it let's get started
let's go cuz I yeah I'm scary let's go
ahead and get started okay so starting
out with the blank canvas I'm gonna go
ahead and prime my face and okay just
leave you guys some insight
I used the Ben Nye clown white face
paint and what I will say is okay once
we get to this clip away no I'm jumping
ahead oh my god I'm gonna glue my brows
down I'm gonna blue blue groove blue
glue my brows down first oh my goodness
we're just gonna roll with this
voiceover I don't care anyways upon
applying the face paint I realized how
dry it was and it was really hard to
blend so as you guys can see my face
looks a little oily and that's because I
applied a really light layer of oil to
my skin and I also mixed in a little bit
of oil to the actual face paint as well
on the back of my hand and it made it so
much easier to blend it still lasted a
very long time as long as you set it
really good but it made it so much
easier to blend because at first when I
was blending it on its own it was so bad
Chi I was like mm-hmm
I'm not patchy why's the clown I'm penny
wise the clown so we can't beat patchy
so I added a little bit of
so if you are finding it hard to blend
just add a little bit of oil and you
will be okay okay so anyways I'm gonna
go ahead and continue to apply this to
my neck and I didn't go OD you know I
didn't apply it all the way down because
it's gonna be covered with a little
whites clown thing anyway but I'm said
go ahead and apply it to everywhere that
is going to be seen and then on the
forehead I'm going to apply a little bit
to the forehead and then with the brows
I'm gonna go ahead and take my finger
and just put a really nice thick layer
of paint on there and I only did this
because I don't want to just blend with
paint on top if that makes sense I want
to put a thick layer because I don't
want to you know disturb the glue
underneath I hope that makes sense and
then I'm going to go ahead and apply one
more layer of the face paint because I
want this nice and white so I'm just
applying it packing it on and yeah I
like how it looked because I'm
perfectionist I did not want to look all
like uneven so I want to make sure it
was even as heck and then as you can see
I didn't go over my entire lip only the
outer rim and you guys will see how that
comes to play later on and now I'm just
taking a huge puff pad and I am setting
it with some translucent setting powder
and this is from dermablend and I'm
using a big puff because I want to cover
a larger area because I do not want to
come across any patching or just any
mistakes so using a larger puff really
helped and I know this for a fact
because I practiced this look off-camera
and using a smaller puff it just didn't
really quite give me give me the
flawless the flawless penny-wise the
clown that I was going for okay next we
go ahead and work on the eyebrows and
I'm just kind of looking at the
reference photo and I am going to take a
mixture of a white and black paint and I
created a grey and the reason why I did
this is because if you look at his brows
it's really an indent it's not even an
actual line it's an indent and I tried
to do the indent but it was just a
little bit too complicated and I want to
make sure my tutorials are fairly easy
so I opted for a gray because I don't
want to be too dark I don't want to be
too light either so a gray gave me the
the color I wanted something
go ahead and just make his brows next
I'm a move on to the smoky eye and I'm
taking this morphe slate gel liner and
I'm taking this because it lasts long
and with this smoky eye it was so hard
for me to do because I am a
perfectionist and I'd like to have a
great fantastic beautiful blend but with
this I wanted it to be very sloppy and
just really messy you know so hard for
me because I like it to be nice but I am
just packing on that and then just
blending it out really rough because I
wanted to look like you know I've been
rocking this smoky eyes for days because
I don't know when I look at the photo it
looks like I mean you don't care so we
don't care so I'm just applying the
black and then blending it out and then
setting it with a black eyeshadow and
then when I get to the bottom power of
the eye I'm gonna apply the black and
then I took a q-tip because I wanted to
blend this kind of more sloppily than
the top part and I almost wanted to mix
in a little bit with the face paint
because I don't know it just looks like
his eyes are just kind of like really
smoky and just nasty under there so I
wanted mine to convey the same sort of
vibe and I'm gonna go in on pop on some
mascara and then that's it for the eyes
and then next one I move on to the red
for the face I'm taking this makeup
forever flash palette and this UV wheel
and I am creating my mixture so you
wanna turn the black light on it looks
kind of like you know cool and I'm gonna
add some UV powder and that made it even
more red don't worry I'll have
everything listed down below but I
basically created a mixture using those
things so that I can get the red that
I'm going for and I wanted to make sure
that I got a red that still looks nice
and red without any UV or blacklight but
still looks really cool with the black
light and then okay I'm kind of sad
because one of my clips for whatever
reason didn't save as a movie file so
unfortunately it won't make it into the
tutorial but what I was going to show
you guys is how I got the stripes look
kind of neon and look like they're lit
up and I'll just explain it as I'm doing
this after I applied this face paint
this looked bright in the backlight but
just not
right enough for me so literally all I
did I took a pencil brush and I took
that UV red eyeshadow and I just applied
it to these sides of the little strip so
I hope that if you do this at home that
is easy to understand I was so sad I was
so sad because that was my favorite part
of the tutorial but literally all I did
was take the UV red eyeshadow and I took
a pencil brush if you have one at home
and I just apply it to both sides of the
little little line on my face I'm
painting right now and that's how I got
to look like it was lit up neon and as
you can see ya cut off the part where I
did my nose and everything else I'm so
fresh I was so sad anywho as you can see
I am underlining my bottom lip and I'm
going to underline my top lip which is
why I blanked out the shape of my lip
with the white paint and I'm doing this
because my Cupid's bow is pretty strong
and when I looked at the reference photo
his wasn't that strong so I kind of just
want to you know just follow it as much
as I could and I'm gonna go ahead and
fill in my lips with some liquid
lipstick this one's from morphe and yeah
any sort of kind of bloody deep vampy
red will do and then on top of this I'm
going to take the UV red eyeshadow and
that is how I got the lips to look a
little bit well lit as well I'm gonna
pop on the UV eyeshadow and yeah it's
gonna set it off it's gonna set it off
and I am talking right now to fill in
some time because I talked ahead of time
but as you can see I'm doing now what I
said I was going to do a couple seconds
ago and I turned on my UV light just to
make sure that it was popping and then
the last two steps are really easy all
you need is some nice neon contacts and
then you're gonna pop on your wig do not
go to a freaking wig store that's got
charged $60 for this kind of wig because
what the heck that's so appraised but
yeah I went ahead and sprayed the wig
with some UV spray paint I use a mixture
of red and orange and okay and then I go
ahead and palm a little clowned little
collar and then that is it for the look
yes and you find your clown suit not
that good stuff and you're good to go
you are penny wise you are penny wise
now so that is it for this tutorial hope
you guys liked
you happen to recreate it be sure to tag
me and stay tuned to next week for more
Halloween videos hope you guys are
excited and I will see you guys in my
next one peace out
Pennywise out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
