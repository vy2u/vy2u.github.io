little intro as you can see today's
tutorial is a little different
once again I kind just want the flow
just like I want my other Halloween
video and yeah I'll explain once I get
some down time but right now I don't
want to skip this right now I'm just
aligning and just figuring out where I'm
gonna place my zipper as you can see I
cut off some of that extra thickness so
that it can fit well in between my
eyebrows and then I'm just going to take
a felt-tip marker liner marker and just
kind of outline where I want my zipper
to lay and now I'm taking liquid latex
and this is my first time ever working
with liquid latex so yeah if it doesn't
look all perfect hell I'm proud of
myself because I've never used this kind
of medium before ever so but it was
really really exciting and I am excited
to learn I do all these because it's
just so exciting anywho I'm just laying
my zipper flat and I'm gonna do the
other side off-camera and I'm up for
this part I did do you know once I've
camera because I just I was terrified
and the wine did off camera ended up
coming out a little bit better than why
did on camera because I just get so
nervous but right now I'm just taking a
latex free sponge and just laying down
some liquid latex and then I'm gonna
apply the tissue on top I did rip my
tissue as well as split the two ply
tissue together so that I can get one
ply and right now I'm just dabbing on
the liquid latex and as you can see I
kind of messed up but I just kept one
with the flow and just piling it on you
know I didn't want to get discouraged or
anything like that I just want to have
fun with it and you know it doesn't
actually perfect you know as long as
you're having fun and as long as you
know you're ultimately you know at least
80% happy with it and that's what
matters so right now I'm just piling on
the tissue until I get a thick enough
layer I did learn how to do this well as
much as I could from a video on YouTube
and I will link it below because her
video was amazing and it really really
really helped me figure out how to do
this so yeah so first I dried the lake
text you got to make sure it's really
dry
and now I am just applying my makeup
forever
Ultra HD foundation stick and is
blending that in and I learned this from
her video as well to apply the concealer
first and then I'm going to take the
allegro cosmetics BB cream and I didn't
want to take that because I didn't want
the skin to be too thick and I thought
the BB cream was very like sheer so
that's what I want it and I just applied
that on top of the concealer and I'm
just going to blend that out and try to
get it as smooth as I can as well as
place it on the zipper you know to make
the zipper my skin tone as well and then
I'm just going to set that with coverfx
illuminating setting powder and then I
want to make sure it's very very dry and
then I'll be able to pull it apart if
you want to learn how to do this you
know the better way then definitely
watch our tutorial it will be linked
below because I'm not no stealer you
know I give credit where it's due and
for the eyeshadow look I kept it very
simple only used two eyeshadows I can't
think of them from top my head but they
will be in my description bar and I want
them to be somewhat of a cranberry pink
color to match my unicorn so that is
what I am doing and I am going to apply
lashes I was gonna do bottom lashes but
I decide to only do top lashes because I
just didn't want to look too you know
dramatic and whatnot because this would
be a lot going on you know underneath
the zippers now before moving on to the
glitter and the painting of the body I'm
going to do my hair first just so that I
don't move my shoulders around a lot
because I don't want to mess up the
glitter once I place it so I'm going to
be wearing a wig for this look this wig
is from WoW African and I'm just going
to section it out into three parts this
is the Sierra inspired wig but I did cut
mine significantly short because I just
I do that freakin every single wig and
then to style my hair today I'm going to
be taking products from lioness beauty
bar they did send me these products for
this video and they send me the heat
protectant straightening cream the
styling spray their flat aren't I
requested the Turkish that's pretty as
well as the curling wand set it came
with whore and I use these skinniest one
because I wanted really coyly curls and
they did come on the gloves
they wouldn't just you know send you the
ones without the glove because then
you'll burn your hands off and right now
I'm just taking a very thin piece of
hair and then I'm going to spray it with
these styling spray and then I'm going
to wrap the wand around it just to get
nice coyly curls and this is what I'm
gonna do to the entire front half of my
head and also just to give a quick
little review on these curling wands I
did really like them especially in
comparison to some of the ones that I've
re used before and I'm not gonna name
the company just simply out of respect
because I'm just not that kind of person
but I felt like this one had a better
grip because I thought what the other
ones I would get freaking frustrated
because it would just slip out on my
hand and I just yeah I didn't have any
grip at all and it's alright bad enough
that have a time I don't know I'm doing
because you know I have had my own hair
in years so this one made it definitely
easier and I feel like the styling spray
really really helped a lot because hell
I'd even know that this is what you can
do because all my curls previously
sucked
and then after all my front curls were
done I took the flat iron to create bear
curls in the back am I the only person
who finds more ease using a flat iron to
curl maybe that's just me I don't know
and then afterwards I just picked apart
the curls and I want them to look very
kind of fluffy and I just by pin them
all the way back and at first I was like
oh my god this is such a granny style
but I actually really liked it I thought
it gave me kind of a kooky kind of look
to go with my unicorn look and then I
did not feel myself creating my horn but
all I did was just take a simple sheet
of paper I wrapped it up I taped it I
covered it in liquid latex and then I
applied my glitter and add layer on top
of layer and then I cut two little holes
and placed two bobby pins on each side
just so that it'll be easier to clip
into my hair because I didn't want to
put any kind of glue or anything in my
hair and as you can see it went on very
easy and then for the body part I will
speed it up just a little bit because if
I didn't speed it up we would be here
for hours but for my pink
I took a mixture of a black a white and
a red paint just to get this nice pink
the paints I used were for mehron as
well as Ben Nye and they will be linked
in my description bar just you know
exactly where to get them and exactly
which ones they are and then I took a
glitter I got this glitter from
Michael's arts and craft store and as
you can see I'm spraying my brush with
fix+ just so that the glitter can adhere
good to my skin by the same time not get
too sticky and then I took a purple
glitter just to define my little
whatever you call that area oh geez I
need to go back to science class because
man and I just basically at contour in
those areas and I thought this is
important because they really just added
more depth and then I'm also going to
highlight I'm going to highlight using a
nice kind of pearl live shade and I
played this just really really brought
out the look and made it very very nice
and gorgeous and then after that I will
just to be about done and I'm just going
do some finishing touches and then that
will be it and as they make it was done
I kinda want to get into why I decided
to do a unicorn and not you know bloody
gory stuff and the reason I did this is
because it was kind of the symbolization
to me you know I'm unzipping or
releasing my inner creativity because
I've never done special-effects makeup
before I never did Halloween makeup only
Halloween makeup ever succeeded in doing
was to get a free burrito like I said in
my last video and I am serious and the
reason being is because I've always been
intimidated by it I'm just like oh I'll
never be as good as you know these
amazing special effects artists so I'm
not even gonna try to me a fail but then
I said to myself I said you know dallisa
you're gonna do it this year and you're
gonna put it out you know people may
love it people may hate it but as long
as you try and as long as you show that
you're really trying and to me trying is
so important because you just never know
what you're capable of I never knew I'll
be able to do a zipper face like I never
imagined myself doing that so this is
what I want you guys to take from this
video try have fun it doesn't have to be
perfect but as long as you try it that's
really all that matters you know and it
just makes me so happy to be able to
even put together this video for you
guys
so I really hope you guys enjoyed it I
really enjoyed it I'm enjoying this
month so far I cannot wait to make more
videos for you guys and please let me
