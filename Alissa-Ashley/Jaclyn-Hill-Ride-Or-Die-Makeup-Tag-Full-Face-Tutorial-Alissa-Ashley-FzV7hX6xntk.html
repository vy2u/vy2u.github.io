video is going to be the ride-or-die
makeup tag created by Jaclyn hill here
on youtube you guys should know who that
is not what rock you living under you
need to get out of that rock today's
video is gonna be that and it's gonna be
a little bit different because in her
video she just talked about to all of
her ride-or-die makeup products from
foundation to liner basically everything
everything and if you could just have
that one product and not use anything
else that's what it would be and I
decided to actually do a tutorial and
put on my ragged eyes my squad on my
face so you guys can just see just see
what looks like and I just feel so
amazing I know because I think I look
great because I just know that these
products are just always them give me
that flawless look it's a baby slay so
if you want to see my ride-or-die
products in action then just keep on
watching also you aren't subscribed
already be sure to do that cuz I don't
know what you're doing if you're not
subscribed
maybe I'm annoying to you but I mean I
can be annoying but this isn't helping
with your makeup so please subscribe for
that reason and if you don't want
subscribers pick I just watch the video
hope you liked it be sure to give a
thumbs up if you do and let's just jump
into it let's look through food do it
let's go into it you guys I'm doing
right now like okay so first things
first my writer night backdrop would be
yellow obviously because you guys love
Ryan who's yellow so I kind of want to
just include that as well because you
guys know my yellow you know I love my
yellow okay okay so let's just grab some
stuff on my desk for foundation I kind
of try to think okay what foundation has
my exact match I don't mix too to get it
which one feels the best last the best
and it's just amazing I'm always raving
about it's the cover FX natural finish
oil-free foundation and the shade in a
70
this is my baby if you watched a bunch
of my videos I'm always using it it's my
favorite so I just I knew had to be the
one for this video because other
foundations I loved but I had to mix
them so I tried to think of one that I
did not have to mix and that was my
rider dizzle I'm gonna take this morphe
54 brush will just slowly become my
favorite foundation brush because it's
so wide so it really really covers a lot
of area and quick amount of time
now for concealer this is a concealer
that I have been using since well before
I started YouTube is actually my first
high-end concealers because I just love
this brand it is the NARS radiant creamy
concealer in the shade biscuit you guys
see me uses all the time I'm pretty sure
like a hundred percent sure this the
only concealer that I bought my move my
own money you purchased it more than ten
times 110 times so this has to be this
has to be the right or not I'm still
head apply that and go ahead and blend
it out what's another right at eye
product of mine which is the beauty
blender I'm pretty sure this is like
everyone's weather-tight go ahead and
blend it out and I got one of my new
ones so she can look nice and beautiful
on camera and not on theory like my
other ones go ahead and blend this out
and then my ride-or-die setting powder
under the eye has definitely got to be
the Laura Mercier powder I have a
love-hate relationship with it not gonna
lie to you I wouldn't lie to you
honestly I'm high I do have my love-hate
relationship with it because it just
it's all about how my skin is acting on
the day but for the most part out of all
the powders I own this will definitely
be the one that okay like if I have to
choose I would choose up on this one
so open it up I'm gonna use my Real
Techniques sponge to just apply the
powder because I don't wanna get this
sponge all dirty she's beautiful and
she's clean so I'm gonna go ahead and
just set the under-eye
now go ahead and dust that away first
I'm using one of my ride-or-die brushes
I've had this for like at least two
years now
it's the morphe in for 3/8
and then by the rest of my face this is
actually a drugstore option and it is my
maybelline shine free powder and the
shade medium this just like my most
favorite face setting powder
it just works better than anything else
that I own I do like to use the Laura
Mercier to set my face sometimes but I
find that it tends to kind of lighten my
skin but the maybelline shine 3 powder
in the shade medium doesn't really do
that it just sets it looks flawless so I
love this powder I'm gonna use a morphe
one and just apply it
I just just kind of dip into the powder
pack it onto my face this is a rider die
method yeah right and I admit it and I
like to buff it away and just leave me
one nice love this airbrush skin for my
contour slash bronzer I'm pretty sure
you get some gets it he done guess it I
guess right now I guess basically the
same one all the time I've tried to
switch it up for you guys because I know
I was using it too much but if you
haven't guessed by now it is the Too
Faced dark chocolate Soleil bronzer you
guys know how I feel about it
you know I've hit pan on two of them
already and this one's brand new brand
spanking new and I'm using the morphe 4
brush just to add that to my face I just
love this product it's a nice balance
between warmth and contour goodness and
it just it never fails me it's very very
smooth and whenever it gets my mouth I'm
just like because it's just like
chocolate it's sweet so it's like a
win-win situation it's a win-win
situation
he liquid and they go ahead and ooh I
should show you guys my right eye
contour for my nose brush hold of it my
ride-or-die brush for nose contouring
and this is my favorite brush of all
time I have tried so many different
brushes and this one's my family it's
the more feet M 5 to 4 and I like it
because ok it's a little bit thin but
not too thin it's fluffy but not too
fluffy it's wide but not too wide so it
just fits
just perfectly because if it's if the
brush is too stiff you're gonna get a
little line if it's too fluffy you're
gonna get it all over the place but this
is like a perfect balance in between it
just goes across the nose so beautifully
it's very very very natural
unless I'm spikes I'm kind of like Odie
but very natural very natural let's go
ahead and step away from the face a
little bit and work on the eyes imma
start with my brows and it was a little
bit difficult to figure out which broad
product was my ride-or-die but I kind of
knew that it was definitely the benefit
browsing this is the old browsing not
the new pack Pink's I've had it for that
long it's the benefit browsing I like
the fact that it has a wax and a powder
so if want to go for a more natural look
I'll just use the wax and if I want to
go for full on I'll use wax and powder
and all that good stuff so I like the
fact that has two options so I'm gonna
go ahead and just fill in my brows using
that
and now I Brown that's the hot mess cuz
I was just being really sloppy so I'm
gonna take my favorite brow concealer
for my favorite of all time it's a mac
studio finish concealer NC 42 and we
clean it up the needs to be cleaned up
for real
in there for my eye primer my
ride-or-die has definitely got to be the
Urban Decay primer potion in the shade
Eden this has just been my favorite ever
since I discovered it and I don't think
i'ma find anything that compares I like
the fact that it has a tint to it just
like my old fave which is the Mac soft
ochre but soft ochre gets very very dry
so I like feather this has that tint it
Prime's what doesn't get super duper dry
and of course I'm gonna set it in place
like I always do now for my palette my
ride-or-die palette it was really
difficult reason palette because I like
single eyeshadows because with single
eyeshadows you just customize and
everything but if I had to only use one
palette for the rest of my life it would
definitely be the morphe 35o I'm sure
you guys were gonna guess that and for
this next little part I'm just a create
an eye look I'm gonna create my
ride-or-die eye look which I'm pretty
sure you guys have seen me do so many
times before which is why I'm not going
to talk I'm just going to show you guys
because I'm using and yeah we're gonna
resume after I'm done applying these
eyeshadows
to the other side
and then obviously for my lid I'm gonna
have to use my ride-or-die Mac makes a
meeting eyeliner on the eye you have to
announce that you guys know this is my
ride-or-die
and you use this for every single thing
on my lip everything everything every
school look I do I use my Mac mixing
medium so just had to say that even
though you guys already know let me
resume now
and then for my eyeliner I think it's
quite obvious because I've used it in
two of my winged liner videos it is the
Kat Von D trooper liner I love this
because it stays in place all day it's
waterproof and it's just really really
easy to apply now isn't my favorite when
it comes to applying on top of pigments
so much because it can kinda get in the
way but it still works it works good so
I'm gonna use it okay
knock on my scare I'm not really a huge
mascara girl I kind of just thought just
any mascara I could find on my floor
honestly because I usually wear fake
lashes so I'm just gonna take this
Makeup Forever aqua extravagant mascara
and then for lashes if I can only wear
one pair lasts the rest of my life
my ride-or-die lashes would definitely
be Lily lashes and the style con sure
you guys knew that because I've always
wearing these lashes in my bottom lashes
I do have a writer dye mascara for them
because this mascara is the only one
that has been able to make me look like
I actually have lashes under there and
it is the it cosmetics superhero mascara
okay so the eyes are done this is my
ride-or-die makeup look for the eyes
this is what I would just kind of
gravitate towards if you watch some my
other videos I do this style a lot that
machine so now for blush my favorite and
this one looks really kind of beat-up
and I was trying to find the one I just
stitched but I can't find it
it is my makeup geek summer fling blush
this is just the perfect peachy tone
blush it just warms up your cheeks
without making the Barbie like you know
like zog crazy it's just beautiful and I
have a new ones I'm gonna matte that
shake eyes ugly one but hey it's okay
that's beautiful
and I'm taking my morphe efore brush to
apply it see how just warms up the
cheeks just very naturally it's very
very soft it's just like incredible and
I'm gonna use it for at least a year now
at least a year now for a highlight
shockingly enough this is excavator it
easy me to decide if I can live with a
highlight combo it would be benefits
Watts up so we'll go ahead and apply
that first and take my finger warm it up
into the finger first and then just
apply it on my high points
but the reason why I like Watts up so
much is because it just kind of really
adds that pop up highlight it takes a
highlight to the next level because
you're applying a cream before you apply
your actual pattern my lights and I like
this because with the summer the other
cream highlighters that I've tried it's
almost to a moldy and in creamy that it
takes up the rest your makeup this one
doesn't do that it's like a perfect
balance of a good dryness and the
creaminess that allows it to work out
very well so for my highlight on top of
this my ride-or-die has definitely got
to be my laura geller guilty' honey it
has to be because it's so golden and
just it just makes the cheeks pop and
it's amazing and the packaging little
swirl reminds all kinds of jacked up but
it's amazing you don't have already you
need to it's always sold out for a
reason
I'm gonna use my morphe b8 highlighter
brush just to apply that
and then from lip color um this little
step is a really necessary for the Lu
color I'm wearing but I do want to
include it because it's definitely my
ride-or-die lip liner and you guys
already know it because you guys getting
on me about doing the same color over
and over again and I was like oh please
I have to put it away but it is my kiss
New York roasted coffee lip linen I love
you you and it's only like three dollars
so it's Jude and Jim's like a bay area
term like it's people just want to share
with you guys and then for my actual
lipstick this was hard this was hard
because you can't just take one you
cannot pick one but if I actually wear
one lip color the rest of my life and
the formula I'm gonna have to go with
honest osseous trust issues I don't wear
it often because I don't even think they
have anymore allows my check I did it so
I don't I'm run out because I'm already
kind of low but it's just the perfect
plummy shade it's just amazing it's so
creamy and I just love it
see that to me it's not too dark it's
not too light either which is why I love
it one layer it's already opaque and you
90 another layer which is why it's
amazing
and then to set my face my favorite
setting Spring has definitely got to be
the skin de Navy ascending phrase this
is the all control one so this is
definitely my ride-or-die settings great
because it really does with says that
new okay it's not just a spritz it
really does
okay this nozzles messed up but it's
still amazing okay so here's the
finished look I'm so here for it I just
I've never felt so mean like everything
is just so mean and I know that when I
wear all these products aching my right
and dies I'm that's like I'm gonna
 place so hope you guys liked
