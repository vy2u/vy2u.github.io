today's video as you can see I already
have all my other makeup on and whatnot
but I want to do a I shall look with the
jacket hill and morphe palette and it's
so funny because I found sweater I was
like you know do you guys want it and
then was like oh just don't do a brown
smokey eyed I'll do a smokey eyed I'm
supposed to be seeing it and I'm like
that's what's going to do it there's a
good deal bro smokey I could buy both of
these photos yesterday and or whatever I
have the closest video and everyone's
okay we need tutorials like I literally
use the same palette to do that look so
but I guess I'll trying some different
because no losses see a brown smokey eye
Leggero else so if you guys want to see
me do a little petite - - - - a review
on the sprout they just keep on watching
alrighty so first we're gonna get
started and go ahead and promise
smashbox 24-hour photo finish primer my
favorite eyeshadow primer honestly is
it's amazing by 80 partners on go ahead
and chat about the palette the palette
released one was that i'll just yep I'll
put all employees know on the screen the
con only do it but it releasing a couple
weeks ago and it sold out in like less
than an hour which is like so insane and
I can only hope that one day if I do a
collab that's the same scenario for me
because I'm be so cool I'm sure that's
so surreal feeling every test for $38
and you get 35 eyeshadows so that's a
pretty good value and here's what it
looks like I'm saying is I've seen it
already but can't it look like until you
guys wait this is kind of bright just
kind of give it the spotlight for a
second
okay here's it looks like and it is at
all new formula some morphe injectable
says this on the formula and it's
nothing like their other palettes and I
could definitely attest to that and say
that they're absolutely right because
I'd mention on Twitter that this is the
best palette that Morgan's ever come out
with I have his before is not like a
first impression car video yes they
definitely went in with this palette and
yeah let's go ahead let's just come on
I'm going to go ahead and pull my primer
Nicole as I'm talking but I'll just kind
of share with you guys my sauce on it as
I'm applying the eyeshadow because you
have some thoughts on it prime prime
prime prime alright let's go ahead and
start our for a shade I'm going to take
this shade right here and I definitely
have to say this one my favorites in the
palette and the reason why is because I
would describe it as a really mellow
yellow and go ahead just apply it it's
been more be presence they are 35 brush
I was described as a mellow yellow that
has like I don't know how to explain it
it's not like a we think what's the
comparison like we call sugar pill
butter cupcake is that what's called a
buttercup yellow it's not one of those
we're super bright it's more so very
chilled down as you can see and I like
that I like that about it because I
think that it makes a little more
versatile in terms of I can use as a
transition color and then apply them on
top and you still get a really nice peak
of yellow on underneath the eye shadow
what's out being I don't know it's hard
to explain I love the kind that's a
mellow yellow I think it's going to play
really well with fall makeup looks for
sure I'm going to take this shade right
here and I'll describe the shape as a
convent camel color and I love camel
colors as well and all the matte shades
blend really nice and smooth
and I don't know it is so different than
the other what do you call the other
palaces that come out with like it's
difficult to explain oh these shadows
I've noticed that you can pile them on
top of each other over and over again
and you're not going to get a muddy mess
and I'm not saying that other more be
palates do that I'm saying that I've
dealt with talus before where you pull
one shadow on you put another one on and
another one and next thing you know you
have a great blob on your eye because
they odds kind of blending together
because it's whose chalky and they're -
all over the place and they move a lot
but these ones don't you're able to pile
them on top of each other and get a lot
of depth and eyeshadow and that's one
thing I noticed for a fact that I really
like next we're going to take we're
taking this shade right here this really
nice kind of rich orange e brown shade
it's really pretty by want to switch
brushes I'm gonna take this morphe brush
it's from a collection so it doesn't
have a little number on it I'm going to
use this to apply this shade this shade
is definitely one of my favorites in the
palette I use it yesterday and I find
that every time I pick up the palette
this is one of the shades that I use
because it's so warm I'm going to take
this brush to soften it up and I glad I
a little more yellow that thing I want
to come up not necessarily blow this out
I do want to be more like a kind of
thing going on so I kind of wanted to
spread need a big move
and then next I'm going to take I take
this shape right here for the cranberry
color honestly like this is such a small
look but I don't care I'm going to pack
this right here okay then go ahead and
be boring and not doing shimmer on the
lid I'm gonna go ahead and put a matte
so I'm going to take this morphe in
one57 the max is plus now I'm going to
dip into that cranberry type shape that
I put on the outer part and I'm going to
spray it and pack it on the lid and then
I'm going to take the yellow tip into
the yellow I'm going to spray my six
plus the pop this right here
all righty so I went ahead and put some
lashes on off-camera because I don't
know my lash application name is in week
so I didn't even like spend minutes
doing it on camera and now for the under
eyes I think that I'm going to go ahead
and take this teal shade just for the
sake of trying one of the colorful
shapes in the palette because I don't
want to get yelled at and to do it all
neutral looks immigrant aces and then
I'll go ahead and take this shade right
here and just pop it in the brow bone
I'll put a little bit right here I just
don't want to be too intense then what
happens to my hand I've used as a mirror
go ahead just use this blush
i'ma go ahead and quickly highlight with
my B or highlighter this is number three
this is a for number nine to eight brush
and then for lip and take this morphe
liquid lipstick this in the shape peanut
because when I use movie on the lips as
well while this is pretty adding more
into the gloss look lazy from a take a
napkin I'm just taking some off and I'm
gonna put clear gloss on top I can't
even find my clear gloss I'm using this
you a lift treatment like a bomb it was
giving me the same effect it's probably
a little less glossy and then we're
going to just finalize everything is set
in place is my morphe fittings break so
I love this and I know people kind of
have like a wool from what I've seen
some people don't like it simple to do
I like it mainly because it's like a
mister I don't know to me
sprays that mist are better than praise
that spray because it's a little more
lightweight and I don't know it's art
explain but some phrase it kind of
messes up I'm making a little bit
because it's too hard but this if I hold
it back far enough and just miss it just
it works alright so here we have the
finished look and I'm so here for it
like I love high five to me for not to
doing a brown smokey on because I was
really about to do that I want to be
like imma do it and you can see I'll do
a really warm skins up up on there but I
decide to go ahead and add some color
and account really cute I try to use you
know as mini shallows I possibly can and
just like overall stops on the pallet
I'm sure you guys can kind of conclude
that I like it and I don't really have
any bad to say about it if I did I would
let you guys know but I actually don't
and I feel like that's a sucky thing
sometimes about reviewing products is
that sometimes people they're waiting
for you to say something bad because
it's like they just want
there's so much negativity and people
just love lacking on to like you
something bad so but I'm not going to
give that for me because I don't really
have any bad to say about it the only
thing I would say though is that I do
not like the color of the packaging and
I mean that isn't about the process
itself let's just more so the packaging
because when your baby a see it's like
I've already a dirty you just I can't
see it because you know my life is so
bright but I'm already getting little
makeup marks on it so I don't like that
about the palette because you know like
I wanted to say nice and pretty and on
my rubbing off my little makeup marks so
today I don't like about it I always
hate when brands or just like products
have like lighter packaging because it's
never going to stay clean for me but
other magazine product itself is nice so
I can move past it being white and
beginning you dirty table so I don't buy
white clothes but yeah other than that
it's a nice tile definitely most
palettes that I think will be good for
just everyday use because that's so many
different colors in it you can use
transition shades will be in the palette
smokey eye shades colorful shades
I do wish there's more colorful shapes
but me obviously they can't create like
a huge palette but for what's inside of
there I definitely great multiple looks
with it and to me that's like the most
important thing about a good palette
like can you create more than one look
with this palette like some palettes
they have all neutral shades and you can
only create neutral looks but can I
create a compliment with it yes I can
so I definitely think that it's yes me
hope you guys like my little tutorial
