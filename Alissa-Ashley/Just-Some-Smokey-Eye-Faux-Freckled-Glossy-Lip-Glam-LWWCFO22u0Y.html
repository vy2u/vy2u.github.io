today's video is going to be a really
title of it yet I don't know I call it
but I know that I wanted a really nice
kind of smoky sultry kind of I look
rather a bravura page so I know can we
combine oh that's on 84 and I'll be
using the deck of scarlet palette and
this is their collaboration with songs
deluxe here on YouTube and shout out
Cassandra because I don't know I heard
she's been killing it lately with these
collapse and they're all awesome so I'm
very proud of her
because if you guys meant trying to
perfect you just see some old man like
fun you're cool but today's video is
going to use masks and this one looks
like and I told you got it about Jacob
scarlet and none of the video and they
are a monthly subscription service and
you get one palette every two months
it comes with three eyeshadows to face
products two lip colors new pencils is a
bunch of stuff you can create a whole
entire book with just this palette and
when they sent it to me and I swatch the
colors I squash my snapchat if you guys
snapchat fans and I appreciate guys
remember it I was just like holy crap
this is me like these are my colors this
is my vibe
so yeah I'm talking a lot but I'll be
just out today take care look if you
want to see that happen and just keep on
watching
yes okay so I got a little bit closer
and by the way one of my nails broken so
I know it looks ratchet but like my
appointments a couple days so we're just
struggle until then I'm going to use
this part shape take concealer to prime
my eyes I know I like the shade tape to
prime on a use this to prime time the
eyeballs and the power comes the mirrors
I'll be using the mirror today to guide
me with this eye look and this is a
morphe 28
go ahead and lightly set that in place
with some translucent power like I
always do
so don't get any creasing and I multiply
a little bit tiring my eyes kept any
follow up it's a little bit okay so
taking my morphe m53 for an addition to
the burgundy shade and I'm just going to
pop that right into my crease when I
save this palette it's like ultra
pigmented you guys complete like just
save yourself
it's just packing on so nice for the
guys I think I own a burgundy that is
this burgundy
you know like it's so cool and I'm going
to take a safe product be kind of
contour shape I'm going to use that to
soften it to soften up fit there now
continue pack it on next taking this
morphe in 5:14 I'm take a black
eyeshadow and place it closer to the lid
area
I switch over to the N by 14 that
agencies really straw with really
packing that black on like there's no
tomorrow and I don't want to select to
be too crazy so this is give me more
control okay so you can see I decide
that I want to just go smoking so I
would take this morphe slate gel liner
and this is a more feet in four to two
and that's half this light gel liner on
top so basically I just waste my time
putting black on because I mean it's n
it cover it with dis late anyway so yeah
but that's not just hanging online I
mean I don't really have to bring it up
all the way but I am because it's going
to make the blend easier so I pack up on
as you can see just kind of blending
with the black eyeshadow and I like to
pack black eyeshadow right on top just
to make sure everything stays in place
yeah those will confusing here but I
mean I really just sit down I did not
know what look I want of you I knew I
wanted to be smoky
I didn't know I want to be this smoky
until now and then taking a morphe in
five three four just go ahead and set
the black in place with the black
eyeshadow
nice time go ahead and apply a little
bit of mascara this is the jewel of
blimps matters mascara to incorporate
this shimmery shade I'm going to go
ahead and take this morphe so d6 just
place it in this inner corner here and
hit the highlight of the face and put it
on top okay so I went ahead and put my
lashes on off-camera and the reason
being is because I can't find my handy
dandy last tweezers that make it look
like I got a clown laughs and very
easily like don't but these are lady
lashes in the style con and now I'm a
useful freckles I know that's my weird
smokey eyes usually okay that's not even
aesthetic but okay I'm going to do them
because it slows the thing to do I
really know we'll look I'm creating here
but we're gonna go for it this is the
attitude that this is a little the brow
hit by a black cover my freckles I'm
looking to to mirror may be seen making
a little dot and I said I like this
pimpin because it's so light and it's
cool toned so the freckle is going to be
gone crazy wait before I do my freckles
I want to this trick who has to do that
I think I've seen Chrissy do it a couple
other people they put my bronzer or like
you know on their nose to make this
freckles with more natural or something
for my lips and picking these pencil
that came in the deck scarlet and this
is heartless I'll line my lips no I'll
be look okay for you I have an inkling
about things nil today lines this title
is smooth it out of it
I'll take this long calm magnetic wall
when some old mob Mike I'm gonna just
magnetic mob in the sky Lancome
put her on top I mean you didn't do
exactly what I would do but sometimes
poof okay and I'm gonna mix up
highlights in the palette and highlight
my nose no I'm not pissing you off put a
little bit on my hypos on my face
okay as you can see I decided to go
ahead and just smoke out the bottom
because it does look like not complete
i'm taking my morphe slate don't mind
it's my favorite becomes smokey eye to
adjust so creamy a bomb this one more
p36 them so place it all underneath and
I'm gonna go ahead and set in place with
a black eyeshadow and the deck of cards
out
okay so here is the finished look and
I'm yeah I did I know headed to the
really smoky side of town right yes s
