for today's video if you cannot tell by
the title it is going to be a review on
the new k'kaw beauty and mario
collaboration i got it sent to me and
this is actually my first time trying
anything from k'kaw Beauty I have never
tried anything from their line so yeah I
mean I was gonna say this should be
interesting but I already know how it's
gonna go because I already filmed it so
this is just the intro but it'll be
really fun for you guys see my review
and impression on this brand and to see
if I like it and if I'll be trying
anything else so you have to find out by
watching the video and staying to the
end but let's just go ahead and jump
into this because I talked a lot of this
video just or warning you okay so the
first thing we do is go ahead and prime
and I'm gonna use my color prop middle
filter concealer to do that and I mean I
kind of use eye primers sometimes well
for the most part that's been working
for me it's like to stick to what I know
works okay so before I jump into
applying the shadow I know it's gonna
sit here you may have to blend it back
out I do want to go ahead and talk about
the palette a little bit and okay first
impression this is what the package
would look like when it came inside of
this but like the same thing same color
you get it when I first looked at it I
liked the presentation a lot because of
how just minimal I like the gray the
choice of great I know that sounds weird
but like I liked the choice of gray on
it it's just very simple and straight to
the point the sticker on the back is
crooked which I mean that's not like
terrible but I feel like sometimes like
for the price point of what you're
paying you do want everything to be just
nice and like perfect but I mean I'm not
like I don't know I'm not very like
snobby I'm like oh my god like stickers
crooked like oh my god like ah you know
that I'm gonna forfeit over it but I'm
just kind of taking notes of everything
okay when I first opened the palette and
I saw these shadows or just my saw
online I wasn't too like oh my goodness
like this is like the best pound in the
world like it didn't scream at me like
palates dude like for example when I saw
the Sephora pro warm palette I was like
oh I gotta get that there are certain
palettes where I'm just like okay like
dude I need that in my life and this
wasn't really that to be completely
honest and I did not purchase it was
actually said to me which I mean
obviously I'm sure you guys know because
it's not out yet but I'm still gonna
give you guys liked my honesty like I
wasn't like holy crap
I need this palette of my life but I'll
go ahead and tell you guys like my
review because as you can see one night
is already done so I'm gonna talk
through each shade that I used and I'll
give you guys some swatches to kind of
give you guys a review or a deep review
of the palette aside from like my first
impression of it enough talking this
concealer kind of creased up a bit so
we're just gonna tap on it and I'm gonna
take this BH Cosmetics and it's my rate
I shadow brush because it's a pallet
eyeshadow brush I really like this brush
a lot and I'm going to dip into let's
see I'm gonna take let's see how do you
how do you decide for that I'm gonna
take this chair right here okay I'm just
gonna pointing it because I'm confused
and I'm just gonna apply this to the
brow bone area and this shade right here
I mean you guys can see you guys like
I'm not gonna sit here and like overhype
or under hype you guys leave it to just
see the shadows for their true xx call
it quality this white is amazing it's
very very hard to pull off like that
bone color I feel like because whenever
I do use like palettes I'm like always
not always but sometimes pretty darn
underwhelmed over there white or there
cream shadows but this one is so bright
so I'll definitely be using this a lot
because I really like how it looks on my
brow bone because as you can see this is
definitely more toned down it just it
doesn't look too overwhelming to the eye
because I know you guys have seen those
brow bones that are stupid or white it
does not give you that effect because
it's really nice and creamy and buttery
so I do like this shadow a lot I'm gonna
go ahead and take this one next I don't
know why I just talk like that and I'm
just going to pack this in here in this
shadow I want it
necessarily say that I was underwhelmed
by it but I did want more from it like I
wanted more of that kind of brown tan to
come out oops I just not something but
it's definitely more subtle as you can
see it's buildable I just I just want to
know more tan Brown but that's just like
a personal thing and again like reviews
and stuff like that they're all sort of
a personal preference thing as well so
like I can say oh I want this to be more
like this
doesn't make it bad it just means that
this what I want and I'm just a breath
but it's okay it doesn't mean it's bad
so if you're kind of wanting people that
like like some more subtle sort of tan
Brown situation this would be great I
think this is a great everyday color
that you could just like flush over your
eye I like to do the lot with shadows
whenever I don't feel like doing a full
blown look I just flush over the eye and
I go so I like that for that next I'm
gonna try it this one right here and I
noticed now that I'm looking at I used
all the matte ones therefore matte
eyeshadows and this one is a very
pigmented so I have to go light on it
otherwise I would get almost like a
brick brick colored eye oh that would be
kind of pretty hot a brick smokey eye
anyways I'm gonna go ahead and just
blend that right on top and I liked this
shade a lot I think that honestly out of
all the mats this one is the most like
oh you know what I mean like you have
that like kind of like a reaction we use
a shadow you're like okay I feel like
this one gave me that actually this is
another one okay okay hmmm I actually
have two that I did that too and we'll
get to that in a second but this one was
really nice as well now this one this
shadow right here
I'm trying get you guys to see it if you
look at it it looks so cool toned and
honestly when I saw it I was okay like I
cannot use that because typically
cool-toned shadows like this they always
run a very muddy and grey on me
and it looks disgusting and I don't like
it I'm so Kay like dude
going on my eyeshadow what they're
playing oh my god but this one I really
was pleasantly surprised on how I liked
it especially with all the shadows going
on right here because while it was cool
tone it didn't get all muddy and ugly on
me
and I was like okay that is a good thing
because I feel like I don't know some
shadows they just kind of look better on
complexions that are on the lighter
spectrum I'm just go on seeing some
shadows I feel like are some shadow
palettes are formulated to be for a
lighter complexion and I mean I feel
that way sometimes about the Tarte
palette when I use them when I member I
first bought my first Tarte palette and
I was so sad because all of them
literally turned gray and muddy on me
and I was like what the heck is
happening everyone else can create such
an amazing look I'm like what's
happening and I feel like sometimes they
do run muddy but this one it looks
really good and it just I don't know
it's like a nice cool tone kind of brown
kind of taupey color I would describe it
as more taupe than brown but I know I
think everything is brown but I really
liked it I liked it a lot and I liked
how this color looked with that warm
tone shade so upon using the shadows I
realized them okay hmm
because when you first look at it yours
okay like how the heck you know like
what are you gonna make with this am I
definitely feel like adding in this kind
of warm break shade and then that topi
shade it was like a really nice
situation that's that's my new word
situation because I feel like they go
really well together like see they look
really pretty together so I was okay I'm
seeing the vision now I see the vision
I'm gonna take this morphe m4 31 and I'm
gonna take that Tanny Brown shade and
I'm just gonna pop this right underneath
basically what I'm doing is I'm just
taking all the shades I took up there I
put it down there
that's why I always do we do get a teeny
tiny bit of fallout but nothing too
dramatic
I'm glad about they're not super powdery
at all so that it's good now let's go
ahead and we're gonna take a little bit
of the colour-pop concealer and I'm just
gonna place this on my lid area take a
little bit and then let me grab my
concealer brush just to create a line
and then I'm gonna take that bone
colored shadow and just pack that on top
and then honestly I was dying to just do
an all matte look because that's just
Earl it's kind of how I'm feeling today
but I was like they would kind of kill
me if I do not use the shimmers so I'm
gonna go ahead and use two shimmers just
for you guys I took this shimmer right
here and this shimmer right here and I'm
going to mix them and just pop them on
the inner corner
and we go on and pop on some mascara and
this has benefits bag out being mascara
it gave my favorite okay so here the
eyes done and let me go ahead and just
watch the four shades I did not use for
you guys
on my fingertips let's see I didn't use
these four so here with the other four
shadows look like that I did not use I
was very tempted to use the blue but
upon seeing everyone else's review
everyone seemed to use blue so I was
like Alyssa you're not to use a blue and
also I mean I kind of have been more
neutral as I'm sure you guys could tell
so now let's go ahead and jump into
these three lip shades so we can kind of
finish off this video on the pink aw and
Mario collaboration okay so first let's
try the lipstick and this one is called
classic K and I like the packaging
because it's like that transparent sort
of mattified look okay so this is what
the color looks like let's go ahead and
we can see it there we go this is what
the shade looks like and I'm gonna try
it out but honestly speaking and just
looking at it I feel like it's
definitely one of those shades that I
would have to pay with a brown liner but
that's like with every nude basically
we're gonna see honestly this is really
pretty I would still pair it with a
brown liner because I just it's what I'm
used to this is really pretty
I like this color a lot and like the
formula a lot glide it on very well with
a nice and creamy feels nice and
comfortable on the lips I definitely
want a brown liner to pair with it but I
mean I think it looks really pretty I
like it okay next we have super nude so
this one I'm gonna assume it's
SuperDuper nude oh yeah
I'm not sure how I feel about the
formula of this cuz as you can see I did
this and it all kind of like gathered
right there let's walk and see what that
does hmm I'm not sure about the formula
it's not sure if I'm sold on the formula
at the gloss yes I think he's doing that
maybe need to exfoliate just in full
details I don't know and I also don't
really like the color because I feel
like well let me not speak too soon I
feel like if you were to layer it on top
of an existing color on your lips sure
but for me I'm not really here for this
color on me and also it keeps looping up
right here so yeah not a fan of that and
now let's try juicy I feel like it looks
pretty similar to super nude it's just a
little bit more pink um but I'm not
again like super like hype about it like
definitely out of all the three of the
lip products the lipstick it's like I
like it but in terms of this I mean it's
okay let me see it's not super sticky it
feels okay but I'm not really that like
I don't know I'm not as you can see my
energy towards this isn't as hype as it
was towards the palette and the first
lipstick okay so here we have the
finished look and okay let's go ahead
and just do breakdown even though I
already talked to lots I think I think
that you guys know my impression we're
gonna give it to you anyway the palette
I'm here for it it's approved by me I
like it a lot I definitely understand
these shadow concept and placement more
that I use them or now that I use them
because at first I was okay like what
heck what am I gonna use with this or
what am I gonna do with this especially
that cool tone shade I was very scared
but pairing it with that warm brick
it was just like perfect and it looks so
good on the eyes it looks so pretty
it looks so nice so I am very pleased
with the palette and I'll be using it
again and I mean as you can see I'm just
kind of happy I'm happy to this one well
and I'm happy that I like it because I
would have been so sad if I did it
honestly for these lip colors the
lipstick
I like the lipstick a lot as you can see
when I put it with a little bit of brown
it is a really nice tone and I
definitely think that it's one of those
shades or it will look really nice and
flattering on multiple skin tones
especially with paired with your choice
of lip liner and I thought that way
about a lot of nudes except for the ones
that are super duper duper on the cool
tone spectrum because even I don't like
those ones but for most nudes and you
pair with a nice lip liner it looks
really nice and flattering Fredi lip
glosses I wasn't too excited about those
I definitely feel like the formulation
of them we're just a little bit too
thick for my liking and also I don't
know I just didn't I wasn't a fan like
up the colors but the lipstick I like
the lipstick a lot and the palette I
like a lot so that is it for my little
review on my first k'kaw beauty product
I'm really happy for her and Mario and
his collaboration because I know they're
very close and I mean I just I don't
know I hope that one day like maybe I
can do a collab with someone that I'm
super cool with that I'd just be really
really fun it just seems it'll be such a
fun process so I'm always happy for like
people doing like happy things I'm just
a happy person that's just how I vibe
but that is it for this video hope you
guys enjoyed it let me know what you
guys want to see but other than that
thank you guys so much for watching and
I'll see you guys in my next video I
tried a week it was bad
peace out
