another brush bootcamp today's bridge
bootcamp IDEO is going to be on this
eyelid that you see right here and it is
using the Kat Von D metal matte palette
before I get into that lose my voice oh
God
before I get into that I do want to give
you guys an update on the face fresh
boot camp because you guys are so ready
for it and I feel like okay like if we
go understood like what I have planned
for this this um is taking a little bit
longer than I had hoped because I have a
lot of stuff freaking plant this the
face brush book I keep saying this the
face fresh boot camp is gonna be a bit
more extensive than the eye brush
bootcamp videos and I can't I don't
wanna give it away because I kind of
want to be like oh wow that's cool but
let's just say that in the face brush
bootcamp I am determined to service
everyone everyone all skin types all
skin tones everyone in every category so
please be patient with me while I gets
together because I'm trying to perfect
it and make sure that it is balm for you
okay so just give me some time it is
coming November
do not worry but yeah just explaining
why saying so long because I want this
to be the anyways today's video is
going to be using the Kat Von D metal
matte palette and I'm going to give a
little review throughout the video my
little pop-ups and all that stuff I
asked you guys on Twitter and snapchat
what palette you want to see me do a
video on and you guys said this palette
so I decided to create this nice cool
toned look for you guys and I hope you
like how it turned out don't want to
talk too much for the intro because I
want to get to the video hope you guys
enjoy it and I will be giving you guys
my little opinions on it throughout the
videos so without further ado let's go
ahead and jump into it and I hope you
guys enjoy it okay so the first thing we
do is take this Tarte shaped hid
concealer and I'm not going to use it to
prime today because I discovered that I
like it because of its kind of matte ish
texture it's hard to explain I'm taking
this morphe 27 just to apply that and of
course like always just setting that in
place with a little bit of powder loose
powder for my first shadow I'm going to
start out with a brown and this is the
morphe M 514 it's really nice and tiny
I'm just gonna move both when I put the
powder underneath here to catch any
fallout almost forgot apply this in the
crease area I'm gonna take the shade
feather it's a really nice yellow Lee
shade and I'm going to use this to kind
of soften out that Brown and lift it
further up into the eye eye without it
being too intense because I just do just
feather it's gonna be too intense so
mixing in not feather I do just oak it's
gonna be too intense up with the brown
but if I do just oak it'll be too
intense how many times I have to say
that stop talking next time take the
shade stone it's really nice gray shade
in the palette pack that right on there
and I'm gonna take the shade linen on
this em 330 brush I'm going to use this
to soften out stone taking more on stone
them a lift it up further now that I see
where it's at and then take you linen
once again and just softening that out
I'm going to switch over to the m157 I'm
gonna take the shame linen again and I'm
just going to pop that onto my brow bone
before moving into the rest i shadow
oops not focus and on top of that to add
some shine I'm taking the shake glitz
it's so buttery and smooth go and just
pop that right on top as you can see
it's much more intense than just linen
on its own and then taking the tart
shape tape in that same in one57 I wiped
it off a little bit I may use it to
clean my lid
kind of set that in place with a little
bit of linen and I'm going to take my
mixing medium liner by Mac place that
right on top and I'm taking the shape
tinsel I'm going to pack that on
now make sure to seal that in place the
thin layer of the mixing medium and I'm
gonna let that dry before looking up now
taking the m16 9 I'm taking the shade
jet I'm just going to place this on
outer corner and then wait a second I
realize that may be smarter to create my
wing first to see where this shadow is
going to stop to make cream Amin first
and then I'll get back to the jet okay
now back into jet with the m16 9 I want
the black eyeshadow to connect with the
wing and then with the m3 30 just kind
of softening it out
and if for lashes I'm taking these Lily
lashes in the style tease because
they're awesome for the bottom half of
the I'm going to take this hourglass gel
eyeliner this is the shape ocean floor
actually my favorite eyeliners because
so creamy in just as blue is very
gorgeous and then before that dries I'm
taking this ether t6 just to smoke it
out
I burgers drunk kill my vibe
come on and then I go ahead and just
take the shade which one I take take the
trait ribbon and just packing that on
top I took a bunch of shades for the
under eyes it's not kind of just didn't
want to be gray or black so I took
ribbon then I took the lure and then I
softened out the edge with a shade silk
then I go ahead and coat my bottom
lashes with some mascara that meant take
a thin layer of mixing medium and pop
fat right on my inner corner and this is
a morphe 19 I'm popping the shade
twinkle for my lip color I'm going to
take the NARS Velvet Matte lip pencil in
the shade train blue and while this is
beautiful as is I really want to use as
many shadows in this palette as possible
so I'm taking a shape Volt's just going
to wrap it my finger just gonna pack
onto the lips take a little bit twinkle
as well like this candle put some
clothes on that like kind of matches the
swag of this look and I'll be right back
okay so here is the final look and for
someone who is usually so in love with
warm tones
I am so here for this look you guys I
love it I'm so sad I have plans
mmm but I think this look came out great
and my final verdict on the palette
because this is brush bootcamp but this
is also a review on this palette if you
guys like this kind of style let me know
because I'll be able to kill two birds
one stone and I'll be able to do some
brush bootcamp with the brushes I
recommend it to you guys as well as
review some palettes let me know if you
did that but my final verdict on this
bad boy right here is that it's bad boy
it's it's really it's really nice
palette and I like the fact and I really
appreciate this that they medals in the
mattes complement each other because
you're able to create a nice cohesive
look because with some palettes I'm like
who created this you know like what is
this you know like because it's like
some of the shadows don't really float
together and it doesn't make sense but
this palette it makes sense and
every way possible and I'll definitely
be using it in future tutorials and
though it's more of the cool tone side i
like the formula because the color you
see is the color you get and what i mean
by that is that some cool tone shadows
that i've used in the past i'm saying
they're blending and they're all
blending into a gray blob and this one
did not do that so it definitely gets a
a plus for me so hope you guys like this
video if you want me to review any other
palette be sure to comment down that
blow other than that thank you so much
for watching and I will see you guys
soon
this one me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
