for today's makeup tutorial I'm going to
bring you guys this Kim K West Met Gala
inspired look in at first I wasn't gonna
do this because I know that there's
probably so many tutorials but then
again I thought about it and I'm just
like well when you do a smokey eye and
you have hooded eyes it's a whole
different little process it's not as
easy so obviously I want to help people
who have what it is because I have what
it is and it's like it's a struggle you
know I'm saying so I decide that I want
to bring you guys a tutorial in all I
feel like I did a smoky eye like two
years ago so it was time for an updated
look on this black smokey eye and I love
how it turned out
I love the skin I love the lips I love
everything I'm so obsessed so if you
want to see how I achieved this look
then just keep on watching and do not
forget to subscribe I never mentioned it
to you guys but subscribing is
everything so make sure you do that
let's go ahead and just jump into this
makeup tutorial and hope you guys enjoy
it okay so as you can see I have one eye
done so it would just be much easy for
me to have one eye done so I can break
it down what I'm gonna do this eye right
here I'm gonna start by doing the brows
as you can see the brows they just have
this like really nice intensity about
them I looked in the photo and her brows
I mean her brows always look good
honestly but I just feel like there's
something about them that's so like sexy
brows so I'm gonna go ahead and take
this Mac 263 and I'm gonna take my handy
dandy eco brow in the shade Rita and I
am going to fill in my brows and I just
took the wrong brush I have two of them
one not used for concealer and the other
for the brow product and that was the
concealer okay
after the start
and then once they're roughly filled in
we're gonna go ahead and clean them up
with some concealer after I have that
I'm gonna go ahead and take a brown eye
shadow correctly one that's kind of more
cool tone because this is a really warm
tone brow product and I'm going to set
the brown place as well as intensify it
and mixing those cool and warm tones
just makes her a really perfect brow
okay so the brow is done now I'm gonna
go ahead and just take this left over
concealer that I had on my hand and
we're gonna use this to prime our eyes
now for the fun part which is creating
the smoky eye the first thing I do is
take this k'kaw beauty and our genus our
Guinness I'm so sorry for my for not
singing wrong but it's their
collaboration and it's a black pencil
and this is called dramatic oh and I'm
going to use this just to carve out
where I'm going to smoke out my eye the
reason I'm using this is I mean
obviously I'm doing the campaign's where
I look so why not use what her products
but also because I found that using this
was really easy to map out how I'm gonna
do the smoky eye before I go into
another product that's much more intense
so I'm gonna take this and I'm gonna
start by applying it to my lid first
just to the lid because that's the
easiest thing to do notice how when I'm
in the inside of my eye I'm going
outwards and then I go to the out part I
go inwards just to have control over the
product when I have nice control over
this and this could take some time okay
I'm gonna go ahead and take this morphe
I just drop it I'm gonna go ahead and
take this morphe 13 and we're gonna use
this just to blend out the eye
after I blend a little bit I'm gonna
apply more product and then blend it up
once I'm this blended I'm gonna take a
little wipe and just wipe off my brush
really good and I'm gonna use this just
to start to blend this out even more and
create the shape I'm going for which is
like a cat eye because I feel like Kim
K's eyes are just very like so I'm going
to try to emulate that
we're gonna take that pencil again and
we're gonna apply one more layer
and they were going to go ahead and take
the same pencil and apply it to the
bottom part of the eye
to blend this out I'm gonna take a
morpheme 515 because it's really nice
and tiny as you can see so I won't get a
raccoon eye now let's go ahead and just
intensify what we already have going on
because obviously this is not black
enough to get this black smokey eye
we're going to take this Jennifer Lopez
and Inglot collaboration eyeliner gel
and this is midnight and if you are
familiar with my channel and just like
anyone's channel that has ever done like
a winged liner you know that Inglot
makes a really super duper jet black
liner gel and I feel like this is just
like it I mean it's a lot as well so you
know the quality is gonna be good
but I feel like this is really really
black I'm gonna take the morphe Y 19 and
I'm going to dip into it very lightly as
you can see I dip really lightly I'm
going to dip into it and we're gonna
slowly build this on top of this but you
want to do it slowly because this is
really black it's really creamy and it's
very easy to get crazy so we're gonna
apply a little bit and slowly work it
onto our eye where we already applied
that base don't worry too much about
this little inner corner because we're
gonna get that later don't try to use
this brush to get to the inner corner
otherwise it's gonna be a mess
once I have that applied I'm gonna wipe
the brush again and we're gonna use this
to blend it out then we're going to take
our little morphe in 5:15 and we're
gonna go ahead and go to that inner
corner like I mentioned earlier just to
make sure everything's nice and even
next time I switch over to a more feet
wide 17 brush and I'm going to take this
shade from the Jaclyn hill morphe
palette and I'm going to go ahead and
just apply that to the top part of the
eye right here
and then switching over to the Y 19 I'm
gonna go ahead and go into the black
eyeshadow in the palette and pack that
on top
and then once that's packed on I'm gonna
take my wife 17 just to blend it out
and I'm taking a morphe m50 8 with the
same Inglot liner and I'm gonna line
that and then put a black eyeshadow on
top from the Jacqueline Hill palette
and I'm gonna go ahead and just wipe
this brush and I'm going to lightly just
blend underneath just to kind of give a
gradient effect next I'm going to pause
some lashes and these are Lily lashes
and style con and with these lashes
normally I cut from the outer part
because I just kind of want less volume
but since I want more volume I'm gonna
cut from the inner part and I'm gonna
cut about two of these off just so I can
get the last rows of the lash where it's
the most dramatic while the glue is
drying for that I'm gonna apply some
bottom lash mascara because Kim K's
lashes are very nice and long on the
bottom so I'm gonna take my handy dandy
bad girl bang mascara from benefit
because it gives me a lot of length and
then now that the lashes on I'm just
adding some finishing touches because
like naturally sometimes the eyes don't
look exactly the same especially like if
one is more hooded than others so
sometimes I have to go in and just make
sure everything is matched
and then taking this morphe m2 tin I'm
gonna go back into the Jaclyn hill
palette and I'm gonna take a really
light cream color and we're gonna pop
this right here in the brow bone
and I do further intensify and just a
slight little final touch I'm going to
take this Mac 263 brush in that Inglot
gel liner and we're going to line in
here just to kind of give a more of a
cat eye look
okay so the eyes are nice and smoky now
let's go ahead and just finish off the
rest of the face I already have my
foundation concealer on but we're gonna
go ahead and do some contouring and
blush I'm gonna take this Jennifer Lopez
and Inglot palette that I created a lot
has this freedom palette system so with
some of the products from the JLo collab
you're able to create your own little
custom palette as you can see my contour
shades well used and that is what I'm
dipping into we're going to use this
just to sculpt out our cheekbones
and then switching over to a morphe 30
just do the nose
and they're going to go ahead and add a
little bit of blush I'm gonna take the
blush that I have in this palette as
well now for lips the lips are obviously
kept very nude and like skin like just
very nice and natural so I'm gonna go
ahead and take this is a MAC lipstick
this is called well Brad Brown and we're
going to use this to line the lips and
then for the center part of the lips I'm
gonna take this lipstick by k'kaw Beauty
and this is classic Kay this might just
became my perfect nude lip combo wow
this looks so good and then there
doesn't seem to be much highlight going
on but there seems to be some sort of
radiance to the skin and I do want to
add that so I'm gonna take my ELF daily
hydration moisturizer on the back of my
hand and I'm gonna go ahead and do my
little trick where I add somewhat of a
radiance without adding a highlight so
I'm just gonna dip into my sponge and
just go over areas of my skin see how it
just has more of like a skin like now
and I might go ahead and set everything
in place with my morphe continuous
setting mist no shade to my other smokey
eyes but this one here you guys have the
finished look I'm obsessed I am obsessed
I Wow
so I hope you guys like how this look
turned out if you happen to recreate it
well I mean I mean I guess I mean yeah I
mean it's Kim's look but I mean you
could tag me if you happen to follow my
tutorial and it feels helpful for my
hooded eye peeps out there let me know
but other than that thank you so much
for watching I'm trying to get up I'm
trying to take some photos guys I feel
like a cocky right now cuz this looks so
good and yeah I'll see you guys in my
