like you see right here and it is using
the new kite shadow palette and this is
the burgundy palette and this is the
second cut of palette that Kylie
cosmetics has come out with and I review
the first one so I felt like it was only
right if I went ahead and did a tutorial
using the second one now this video is
gonna be as I guess we could say in
depth as the first one because um I just
didn't really making it to a depth
but I will be reviewing these shades
that I used as well as giving my final
thoughts on the palette at the end of
the video also I decided to go ahead and
snag two more palettes while I was
buying mine and that is because I want
to have a giveaway so oh I am having

away two of the palettes to one person

YouTube is also having a giveaway and
she's giving away three so you might
want to enter hers and subscribe to her
channel to have a better chance and you
really want this palette so yeah go
ahead and check those out as well but
without further ado let's just go ahead
and jump into this tutorial and hope you
guys enjoy it okay so as you can see I
already have some powder laid down so
that I don't get me fall out any first
thing that I'm gonna do is go ahead and
take this what is this the Augusta's a
waterproof cream color and the shade
honey and this is a morphe 27 and I'm
gonna use it to prime my eye I'm then
gonna lightly set this in place with
some loose powder whenever I do any look
that involves like a bold color like
this burgandy I like to put down a base
so for my base I'm actually use this
lipstick it's from colour-pop and it's
one of their lippie stix it's called
el bebé and what I did was
just took a little bit of it and I just
placed it on the back of my hand
just like that that's Zeke you guys see
that just like that just place a little
bit on the back of my hand
and I took this morphe seventeen I just
dipped into it very lightly and I'm just
gonna create a very very very three
berries this time thin base the reason I
want to be thin is because since it is
lipstick you know lipsticks they can
potentially get oily so I don't want to
put too thick of a base I want to be
very thin but just applying this
burgundy base is going to really make
this burgundy pop more so I want to make
sure I did that
he's my finger a little bit as you can
see the base looks very modified and
that's exactly what you want if it looks
shimmery at all or just shiny that means
that you may have applied too much and
it may get oily throughout the day now
taking this morphe M 514 and Mike I show
I'm gonna go directly into that middle
color which is the burgundy and I'm
gonna pack this right on top just so
it's really really nice and pigmented
and opaque and just balm it's gonna pack
this on top
and I'm gonna take the color in the
middle on the upper part of the pallet
I'm gonna use this just to soften out
the edges I'm also dip it to the shade
on the corner as well next taking my Mac
makes a medium liner and I'm gonna need
some more assume because we're running
low I'm gonna take this morphe in 1 5 7
and I go ahead and I'm gonna I'm gonna
create gradient okay
so first I'm going to start in the inner
corner right here there's still some
shadow on my brush but that's okay and I
put the bronze shadow in the palette
then pack that right there
I'm going to take more mixing medium go
on the outer corner and I'm gonna play
some more cranberry shade on the outer
corner and then right in the little
center part right there I decided to go
in with the lightest shadow in the
palette just for a little more of a pop
now for my wing I decided to go with the
burgundy wing because I don't know it
was just a little bit different than a
black wing so I'm taking this color
drain as the eye shadow liquid lipstick
and this is Red Sea and put a little bit
on the back of my hand the back of my
hand is like my mixing palette and then
this is the only brush that I'm using
that isn't in the brush bootcamp set but
this is the more feet r45 and the reason
I use this one is because since this is
a liquid lipstick it was a little bit
difficult using any other brush that I
have to create a nice wing because I had
to kind of layer it because this formula
is a little bit more on the it's opaque
but it's more liquidy that makes a sense
so I can use a very tiny brush that will
be able to pack on that wing color
cake I let that dry down a little bit
for I put a second layer on okay now to
add one more layer you don't want to add
too many layers you don't have to be
thick you know don't want to be too
thick but just another layer it just so
it could be really nice and opaque very
burgundy
not to a low-end mascara I'm taking
benefits they're real and then for
lashes these are lena lashes in the
style Naomi gotta be careful because the
last who I'm using is black that's all I
want to ruin my red red red burgundy
wing Jesus it's not gonna take my morphe
36 or IPE because it broke I'm gonna
take that same lipstick that using my
face on the top and I'm gonna use on the
bottom so but take it and just smudge it
on the what is this like right to here
I'm not good at math and fractions and I
like crap it's not half it's like more
than 1/2 what do you call that 1/3 hmm
Oh No and then what's that most of it on
I'm just gonna go ahead and rub most of
the lipstick off of the brush and just
smoke it out with no product on it and
I'm gonna take the burgundy eyeshadow
and place that right on top
now I'm gonna wipe it off gyoon take
some Mac makes a medium liner go pack
that into the inner corner and I'm gonna
take the bronze shadow and place that
right in the inner corner let's go take
this brush just to pop some of the
lightest shadow of the palette into my
inner corner and then onto my brow bone
as well and I'm gonna go ahead and just
coat my bottom lashes with this it
cosmetics super hero mascara now I'll go
ahead and contour using this NARS
Council Bluffs and Gina sure you guys
are expecting that and this is a
morphine for
i take my morphe in five to four for my
nose which is probably expected as well
for blush I want to go with something
more berry tones I'm taking NARS
seduction
for my glow I'm taking this Melanie
Mills body radiance and the shade rolls
gold
taking a little bit on the back of my
hand I'm gonna take a Beautyblender it's
not really damp it's not really dry
either it's kind of just like old and
I'm going to go ahead and just apply
this to where I highlight and I'm going
to take the gleam radiant dust and this
is also in rose gold as well and just
top it on top of the rose gold and if my
lip color I've no idea what to do I'm
gonna go ahead and put this NYX butter
gloss this in the shade gingersnap found
top of that I'm gonna take this white
cosmetics this is their cream lip gloss
this is gold I think this is limited
edition so here is the finished look and
I really hope you guys like how it
turned out
overall I like this palette I think it's
awesome and just like the first palette
I think that's some of the matte
eyeshadows and it are really really nice
like I love the orange and the first
palette and the white I still use the
whites even now because it's one of the
most pigmented whites that I have now
and I just think that it's a really nice
palette the shimmers there's lacking a
little bit and I'm only comparing them
to other shimmer shadows that I own that
are just on fire so there's nothing here
just a little bit they're more of a soft
subtle shimmer so maybe that's what they
are going for because even in the first
palette these shimmers were very subtle
as well so maybe that's just what
they're likes but overall I think the
palette is a good palette if you still
we've used to spend $42 on it
and to my game away
sure you subscribed it's all you got to
do but if you do want to buy it I
definitely think that it is nice I like
it
it gets my approval so other than that
to help you guys enjoy this video and if
you want to see anything else let me
know and I will talk to guys later
that would turn me crazy this
outside outside is no well it's baby you
say it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
