to those who did enter and I'm sorry if
you didn't win but don't freak out
there's got any more now to this video
this video is going to be my lazy face
routine and I just like this is the
perfect routine for anyone who is on a
time crunch who may not want to pile on
and make this is what I do when I am
just being lazy as
and I'm always lazy for this one extra
extra lazy and what inspired this was
that someone said that they do love the
way to do my face but sometimes it's not
realistic for everyday say that is it
let me just jump into the tutorial I
don't want to talk too long but thank
you guys so much for watching and being
here and subscribing and let's get into
my lazy routine okay so the first thing
we do is go ahead and apply some
foundation now you can choose to use
foundation or BB cream but I don't have
any BB cream I'm just going to take two
pumps of foundation I have to mix two
because one of us to light other ones to
dark and I'm just going to bread this on
my hands I'm not even gonna use a brush
I'm lyric you're just going to rub
foundation in with my things
land to your neck forehead I'm gonna
place it on my eyelids as well just so
everything is nice and even okay so the
next step is optional but sometimes I
take concealer and I just like to just
place on my areas where I may need just
a little more coverage this concealer is
pretty close to my skin tone it's the
closest I have so once I blues it in it
will look just like the foundation and
it's like
back there I take my hand and just blend
that in
the next thing you want to do is take a
fluffy brush a nice fluffy brush and a
colorless powder the reason I say color
this is because sometimes when you use
powders with a tint to it it can darken
the foundation it could just taken on to
the color so I'm gonna take a colorless
powder this one is the RCA m8 no colored
powders my first time using it so let's
just see how I like it so far so good
not altering the color whatsoever
everyone raised about this powder and
this brush is from Julius place I'm just
gonna set my entire face with that
powder okay so now our face is
completely flat so this part is optional
but for me personally I have to kind of
bring my futures back out so I'm going
to take the honest Stassi contour kit
this is light to medium I'm going to
take the banana shade I'm taking this
royal and langnickel blush brush and I'm
just going to digging some banana shade
and I just want you to sweep it language
my eye it's gonna create a really soft
natural highlight without having to do
all that super heavy concealer or
anything I love doing this I think it
just look so natural
and it's basically powder contouring
place in my forehead as well
and then with the same kit I'm going to
take a nice contour shade very light and
just really really dust it onto my
cheeks very very lightly very chisel
you're good but and then I'm just gonna
lazily contour my nose but I just take a
little bit powder and just go like this
just a little sweet and as I give my
nose definition without me having to go
in with a brush and do all the extra
crazy stuff just gonna add a light pink
blush just like a berry tone pink just
add some color to my face as you can see
I've only used two brushes throughout
this whole process and my fingers very
very easy very very soft for brows I'm
going to take my concealer first and
just outline how I'm gonna fill in my
brows I'm not gonna make too crazy
because again we're going for a very
simple natural look gonna ally in the
first and then instead of using any
pomades or eat like that where I can
risk messing up I'm gonna take a powder
I'm gonna take the our mustachio brow
powder duo and this is Auburn I'm going
to take my Sephora 22 it's an angled
liner brush and I'm just going to place
that powder in my brows going at upwards
motion starting at the base where I play
the concealer I'm just moving up
I'm gonna go ahead and blend my
concealer away with my finger I'm gonna
go ahead and take that same contour
palette I use for my face in any like
light brown shadow will do but I'm just
trying to use as many or as few products
as possible I'm just going to fluff that
over my crease now I'm going to take
that fluffy brush and I'm kind of
bending it a little bit with my nails
I'm just gonna take it so that's a
little bit more skinny I'm gonna pop
that right on my waterline like you can
the one on my lash line mixed up just a
little bit definition so that press not
blink I'm gonna apply some mascara then
I'm gonna apply a subtle highlight this
is the Laura Mercier once the face
illuminator sums up fly it right on the
high points and lastly for lips when
ever gonna really lays the routine I
live where I live the lipstick - those
are too high maintenance so I'm gonna
mix two glosses they're both from color
green one that is called single that
others caught brown sugar and I'm mixing
them to get a nice ma v pink shade and
she's my go-to shade and brown sugar is
a nice kind of brown hence the name and
singles a nice pink I'm gonna go ahead
and spray my face just give me a nice
mist I have dry skin so gotta do this
and then we're done so here is the
finished look I really hope you guys
like how it turned out this is honestly
my go-to look it's just it's perfect to
me like it's it's such a time saver and
I'm all about saving time so I hope you
guys like it if you do decide to
recreate it let me know how it works out
for you let me know if you have other
lazy tips I can use in my routine okay
and back thank you so much for watching
and I'll see you guys soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
