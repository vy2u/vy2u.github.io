very very tired right now because I just
got done filming a lashe video for you
guys my eyes I'm just feeling all types
of bad because I got I dig up a glue and
take out the lashes but I tried to make
it as informative as possible as I
possibly could
I'm not an expert lashes by the thing
that you guys gonna enjoy this video and
I hope so because my eyes will thank you
for your appreciation so I don't want to
talk too much because I want to get to
the video but I do hope you guys enjoy
this video I hope that you enjoyed my
last video which is eyeshadows and
don'ts video I'll have that link down
below you guys seem to like my do's and
don'ts type of style videos the
implemented ones so I'll keep this up
I'll keep it up let me know what type of
video you want to see next I'm leaning
towards brows lean towards brows let me
know how you guys feel about that other
than that thank you so much for being
here it's so much for watching and
subscribing if you haven't subscribed
already be sure to do that right now
and let's get started okay so first I'm
going to show you guys some of my
favorite tools to use when applying
false lashes the first ones are my lash
tweezers I like these tweezers
specifically because of the shape I
prefer these over regular tweezers
because the shape allows you to get
really close to your lash line which
makes application so much easier the
next tool is my last curler I got these
ones because they are made for deep set
in almond shaped eyes which I have so
they're perfect
I also like having small scissors on
hand because I tend to have to cut
lashes a lot so that they fit my eye
shape because they're usually too long
and then lastly my Thrive cosmetics lash
glue not only is it my favorite lash
glue but I also like their company
because whenever you purchase a product
they donate one to women in need so I'm
all for that now let's go ahead and
assess my eye shape now obviously I
already know my eye shape I have almond
shaped eyes and they are hooded but I
just want to include this because it's
important to assess your eye shape
because that will allow you to know
what lashes to go for and what to aim
for
I also assess where it is the most
hooded and every hooded eye is different
so it's important to figure this out
because this will also help you figure
out which lash is best for your eye
shape now let's go ahead and look at two
examples clearly one is the bad and what
is the good both lashes are gorgeous
however this one is too long it's too
thick so it gives my eye the appearance
of droopiness and it also carries in too
much into the inner corner as well as
the outer core as you can see that inner
corner is just way too thick and
overpowering on my eye now let's go
ahead and assess this one I cut it so
that it wasn't too far in and I'll show
that a little bit later also if you
notice the lash is going in a nice kind
of outwards motion and most of the lash
is focused where I assessed my eyes
where the most hooded so it creates a
nice balance and a nice flow okay so now
let's move on to our demo the first
thing I do is apply a thin coat of
mascara very very thin and then as I
apply my eyelash I lift my eye and this
is important for me and all of my
hoodies out there because we have that
extra meat in the way which will make
putting on our lashes very difficult so
lifting it and even sometimes tilting
your head will make putting on lashes so
much easier as you can see I applied the
lash in the center and now I'm just
tugging the inner and outer corners over
my lash hairs they are curling so
they're in the way and I'm just going to
kind of set that lash as close to my
lash line as I can possibly get it and
now I'm going to take my lash tweezers
and just squeeze my natural lash with
the falsies so there are no gaps and
then I'm going to take my lash curler
and do the same thing you know try to
squeeze together as well as curl the
lash and then here is the final result
these are the ardell demi whispies and
there's some my favorite lashes i
recommend them to all beginners and get
packs to them so you can practice so
yeah here it is as well into the next
demo as you can see this lash over here
is way too long and you can also see the
white band I'm going to show you to fix
that first you're going to take your
lash no glue and you're going to place
it against your eye and I like to place
mine a little bit away
the inner corner because I hate when the
inner corner bothers me and as you can
see I've assessed where I need to cut it
so I'm going to grab the lash wearing to
cut it and as you can see the lash has
little knots so you're able to tell
where to cut you don't want to cut like
in the middle of the hairs you want to
cut them kind of by the knot and we're
also going to remove that white band by
using a felt tip liner and I like using
felt tip because it just gets really in
there and doesn't take as long to dry so
nice little pro tip for you and here is
the lash and these are kiss in these
dollar itse and now here's another quick
example of a latch that is too long for
me and all you have to do again is just
place on your eye assess where you need
to cut it grab it where you need to cut
it cut it and then you're good to go and
I want to show this one because this one
has a solid band so it may be a little
bit tricky but at the same time it's
still easy you took the place on your
eye and you'll find where to cut it and
these are Lily lashes a new style Rio
these are some of my favorites because
it is so nice and fluttery and then
quickly I want to demonstrate how I
remove my lashes from their containers I
like to bend the holder of the lash and
then take my tweezers and just go on the
outer corners of the lash
typically with mink lashes they have a
little bit extra band so it's perfect to
take them out from there also I like to
use the actual wand of the lash glue as
opposed to the what is it called the tip
of the lash glue just to apply my lash
glue and if I ever apply too much I just
dab off the excess on the back of my
hand now let's go ahead and pop on this
lash and like all lashes I always have
to cut it I have to cut pretty much
every single lash that I own but luckily
with these ones it has little dents i'ma
call it dents so it makes it easier to
cut because use those as guidelines very
important to do that use the same lashes
I had on the beginning like I mentioned
I was going to show you guys how to cut
them so here they are duh
now let's go on to individuals when
working with individuals I like to use
trios they're easier and as you can see
I'm just placing it right on my lash
line and I'm just going to kind of tilt
it down a bit just to squeeze it with my
natural lashes just they're all going in
the same direction it does
look crazy and I just like to apply them
one by one not too close together but
not too far apart either just to give a
really nice natural appearance and these
are the long ones these are Dell and I
only apply about four of them so this
what they look like then I go ahead and
curl them because they do need some curl
and here's what they look like curled
and I really like this look it's very
simple but if you want to double stack
you can take a strip or you could take
more trios I took a strip and I'm just
going to place it on top and I'm going
to squeeze them together and I'm also
going to curl these as well just to get
them nice and tight together and here is
the results of that and I think it's
gorgeous I think it's amazing it looks
really nice and fluttery and natural and
it's so affordable we're almost done but
I want to give you guys two more tips
here's a tip for when your lash band is
really really thick so it's creating a
gap between your lash in your natural
lashes just take a felt tip liner
because typically lash bands that are
really thick tend to be shiny I'm not
sure why so I decoded what they felt tip
liner and I like to take my lash curler
and try to squeeze them together as much
as I can and it really gives rid of a
lot of that gap and the lash looks
better and then for my final lash and
final tip I'm taking my favorites and
since they are my favorites they have
glue on it and a quick lazy tip is to
apply the felt tip liner it's really
really quick and it gets rid of all that
glue and I'm going to take the felt tip
liner and just make a little thin wing
not a wing but a line over the last just
to kind of make it blend a little bit
better it's gonna make my lash line
appear thicker and then here is the
result and now we're done and my eyes
are done so that is it for this video I
really really hope you guys enjoyed it
