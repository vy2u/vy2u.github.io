so for today's video I decided that I'm
gonna sit down and do a video on a step
by step flawless routine from the
foundation to the concealer powder to
the brows to the eyes to lips I did
everything on camera because I mean for
one you guys don't really see me do my
base here on camera that much anymore
because I just don't do it and I feel
kind of bad and also because it is
graduation and prom and just event
season I feel like it's just any
occasion season and I want to show you
guys how to get this long wearing super
flawless makeup so that you can wear at
your event or wherever you want to wear
if you want to wear it just because just
cuz we all look cute I'm gonna show you
guys how to get that so that's what I
did today yeah that's why did and that
is all I have to say be sure to
subscribe if you are not already I am
becoming more consistent with my uploads
now finally because I'm out of my rut so
hey for that but if you guys want to see
how I achieved this look right here then
just keep on watching and I hope you
guys enjoy it okay so the first thing
you want to do is go ahead and prime
your skin obviously because you want
this makeup to last you want to look
good you want to just be all nice and
smooth and I'm gonna take this tatcha
silk canvas and um it's really new to me
so the verdict isn't out yet but I've
heard great things and I actually used
it one time and now my skin is breaking
out so that's why I can't like really
rave about it yet but basically any
primer that works for you
for my next step this is if you get
really really oily and this actually
should have been done before primer but
I don't really find this step to be 100%
always needed especially if you use a
good primer and a good foundation but
sometimes if you're on the Sun or if you
just really really produce a lot of oils
this is a great tip for you you could
take a really light translucent powder
and when I say light I don't mean the
actual color I mean just like the
consistency I find this little trick
works best when you use a really fine
powder don't use anything too thick
because it may look really cakey so this
is the hourglass what is this
translucent setting powder I'm gonna
take this morphe g4t dip into this
powder and just apply it around my nose
area because this the area where I get
oily I'm also going to go ahead and just
apply a little bit on my forehead as
well because I tend to oil up there as
well now for foundation I'm gonna take
something that is long wearing that is
the first thing I look for whenever I am
going to any sort of event or any sort
of situation I look for something that I
know is gonna be long wearing and that I
also know is going to look good in
photos and this one is when my favorites
it's the NARS natural radiant long wear
foundation so I'm gonna go ahead and use
this for my foundation today and I'm
gonna go ahead and just blend this out
with my little morphe blending sponge
make sure I give my ear area because I
feel like sometimes people forget their
ears and then in photos the face will
look like a different color than your
ears everything you do not want that
next for concealer you want to make sure
you take one that you know is
long-lasting as well and this concealer
is super duper long-lasting this is the
urban decay concealer and this is in the
shade medium dark this is their
all-nighter concealer I'm hoping I
grabbed the right shade of mine because
this definitely says medium dark warm
well this looks pretty light but I think
once I blend it out it's gonna be my
right one pretty sure so now I'm gonna
go ahead and just set it in place with
my makeup revolution banana powder and a
little trick I want to give you guys is
to take actually a napkin because I used
to just dip into my powder but I'm gonna
take a napkin and I'm gonna dump some
powder onto this napkin let me go ahead
and do that oh I just poured out heck up
out or an accident that's okay so what I
like to do is like to dip my sponge into
the powder right and this is what the
sponge looks like when I dip into the
powder then I'm going to go on a blank
spot dip into the powder dip into the
napkin then we go on to a blank spot of
the napkin and just Pat it off and what
that's gonna do is that's going to
decrease the amount of powder on the
sponge which will eliminate us getting a
cakey under right
and then like always for the rest of my
face I'm gonna take my Sephora micro
spoon powder in the shade tan and my
trusty morphe 58 and just buff it in and
then after I'm done with all my
powdering I like to go ahead and give my
face a little spritz before moving on to
the rest of my makeup okay so as you can
see I went ahead and did one eye
off-camera because it's just easier for
me so now let's go ahead and move into
the brows first so if you guys watch my
videos you will know that I'm always
using this brow product right here it's
called eco brow in the shade Rita
however I am going to avoid using this
today because I find that especially in
hot weather wax based products
especially if you do not set them they
can get really shiny and Cheney and
those don't look good in photos it
doesn't necessarily look the best in
person either because you just have this
shiny eyebrow and you don't want that
because then what happens is say you
take a photo a lot of eyebrow is gonna
vanish because it's waxy and shiny and
it's not the true pigment so I'm gonna
go ahead and use different brow products
today so that my eyebrows are really
nice and bold like you see here because
from every angle it's gonna look the
same shade and just look better and more
just it's just better okay just trust me
on this one okay the first thing we do
is go ahead and take this benefit
precisely my brow pencil and this in the
shade number 4 and I'm gonna use this to
fill in my brows first okay so as you
can see the brows filled in and I'm sure
you guys can tell that there is a
difference between this Brown and this
brow and that is that this brow is
really cool toned and I personally do
not like how cool toned brows photograph
and just how they look in general
especially on my skin tone because I
feel like in certain situations it looks
a little gray and also it just doesn't
show up as much because I just feel like
when you don't complement your natural
undertones with your brows if flash
photography a lot of brow disappears so
what I'm gonna do is go ahead and warm
up my brow using a warm brown eyeshadow
from these Sephora Pro warm palette
which I'm also going to be using on my
eyes today and so that I don't get a red
brow I'm gonna mix a warm brown and a
cool tone Brown just a little bit of a
cool tone just to make sure I'm keeping
it really nice and balanced
I'm gonna go ahead and clean this up
with a little bit of concealer and I'm
gonna go ahead and just lastly set this
brown place with some brow gel next for
I shout out my go ahead and just take
this morphe I lip primer just to prime
my lids I'm taking a little bit and just
dab it in place I'm gonna go ahead and
use the Sephora Pro warm palette to do
this whole look and I'll go ahead and
allow each shade I'm using to pop on the
screen I'm going to take this morphe y17
and take my first shade which is gonna
be my light transition shade I'm slowly
gonna gradually deepen my crease area
with more eye shadows
I'm gonna switch over to and more p210
for the bottom part my next imma go
ahead and just wipe this brush and I'm
gonna dip into this shimmer shade in the
palette and what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna spray it
what's a morphe setting mist and I'm not
gonna apply it to my entire lid I'm just
gonna apply it almost like just to the
lining part because if I do the whole
lid with this method it will transfer on
to my crease area and I don't want that
and I also don't want this to be too
intense I just simply want that subtle
pop to the eye just to really just make
it a little more enhanced without doing
too much time applied this really to the
lining of my eye and as some of that
pigment just gets off the brush I'll
slowly work it up into the crease area
just to make it look nice and blend it
we're also gonna pop this right in the
inner corner just to make the eye really
nice and bright next I'm gonna go ahead
and just take some waterproof mascara
this is by elf and I'm going to go ahead
and just apply a thin layer to the top
and bottom part the lashes the reason
why I'm doing a thin layer is because I
am it upon false is on the top so I
don't want anything too thick
and then for lashes I'm going to go
ahead and take something really natural
because I I mean as of lately I have
barely been wearing lashes but also I
just feel like if you are kind just
doing like an event or depends on the
event or depends on the occasion I just
feel like a really nice natural lash
always just looks good because it's
really inviting because you have just
enough volume but nothing too intense
and I just feel like it looks really
flattering in photos just to have a
really subtle lash so I'm gonna go ahead
and take these Ardell wispy lashes and
then the last optional step for the eyes
if you want to add just a little bit
more of a twinkle you could take this
more feet in 5 15 it's really tiny
teensy brush and just a white eyeshadow
right here just to brighten the eyes
even more let's go ahead and finish off
the rest of the face I'm going to take
this little highlight and contour
palette buy more feet dirty right now
but it's quickly becoming one of my
favorite palettes and this is the 8h and
I like it because I love love love the
contour shades because I love contour
powders that are buildable instead of
too intense because if it's too intense
it's easier to mess up whereas if it's
buildable it's much easier to not mess
up so I'm going to go ahead and take the
shades debutant and blogger and I just
like to go into both because bloggers
more warm and debutantes more cool and
I'm gonna take this makeup Shakti 20
brush and just chisel that much bones
and then I'm gonna go ahead and switch
over to a morphe 30 which honestly has
quickly become my favorite brush for
nose contouring it is so good and I'm
gonna take Debbie talked mainly not so
much vlogger but a little bit of blogger
just to contour my nose
and then for my blush I'm gonna take
another morphe palette that is new I
don't know more me has just been killing
it lately with their products they have
been really really good and this is the
blush palette this is the 8w and I'm
gonna take MUA in provocative that's
what my little combo as of late because
MUA is more like a subtle kind of a skin
Tonee pink and then provocative is that
pop of peach and I feel like mixing them
gives you the perfect blush and just
like the contour shades
these are buildable and not super duper
duper duper pigmented what you actually
don't want in a blush because I don't
know I feel like when they're too
pigmented it's really easy to mess up
and then to highlight my nose I'm gonna
take babe which is in the same blush
palette because it's like a really soft
pink and I'm just gonna have my nose cuz
that way I'll get a more natural nose
highlight I'm looking I monitored it by
the way and it's not gonna be too bright
I also got to take that from my Cupid's
bow I'm switching over to a morphe y 14
and then for my highlight as well I'm
gonna go ahead and take my setting spray
and set everything in place and then
lastly for lip color and this is why I
left the lip for last or safe lip for
last you can literally wear whatever lip
color you want especially what they look
like this because I mean there's no like
I that's specifically tying it to any
sort of shade you can literally wear
whatever you want but I am gonna put on
something bright because why not because
they look good it's gonna be a
showstopper and also I'm going to use a
sephora cream lip stain because these
are very long wearing and also super
comfortable on the lips so you can wear
whatever you want but you want to make
sure you're wearing something that's
long wearing comfortable because you
want to be comfy you don't have to sit
there reapply it over and over again and
this is just the thing I'm gonna take
the shade number zero three yeah that's
not 3203
okay so here you guys have the finished
look and like I mentioned you use any
lip color you want but if you follow the
steps that I just showed you your makeup
will last really long and you won't get
any flash back it's gonna look really
nice and slay --fill and glam without
looking too cakey it just gonna look
really good and you're gonna have a
great time so that is it for this video
hope you guys found it to be helpful if
you did be sure to give it a thumbs up
and I'll see you guys in my next video
and I'm so I'm just in such a good mood
so here's to my good loot
I'm so awkward</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
