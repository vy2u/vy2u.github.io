first things first before we get into
like I mean okay let me just tell you
guys what we're doing I'm giving you
guys two looks using the new lunar
Beauty by Manny mu a life's attract
palette and it is an eyeshadow palette
but before I jump into it I just want to
say that one I'm like holding it
together as much as possible right now
because I'm just I've just already
having a kind of a crappy day I kind of
feel crappy right now I mean I'm sick
about on top of feeling sick
I just feel just uh and yeah I just sat
here and Phil for hours and my audio was
terrible like it was it was like hurting
ear terrible so I'm really doubt about
that because like I like my stuff to be
really just nice and just you guys know
me so I'm just letting you guys know
ahead of time that this video will be
voice over it and I don't like voiceover
because I feel like it's not as personal
I just won't let you guys know that
because I'm really sad about it but I'm
just I'm trying to make it work I'm
trying to hold together so hope you guys
don't hate me for it
yeah sucks but uh aside from that this
video is going to be on the palette like
I mentioned and let's just go ahead and
act as if I am opening it upon getting
it even though I did all this with my
bad audio so here is what it looks like
and to give you guys a size reference
let me me what can I grab what's
something that people own that can grab
this is the Kat Von D 10 year
anniversary palette and here's just a
little size comparison to how long the
palette is because when I first saw I
was like wow this is a pretty pretty big
palette and I like it I like the size of
it just feels very like I don't know I
like it and here is the packaging it
says life's a drag on it and I'll link
Manny's video down below if you guys
want just like more details all the
swatches everything like that I'll link
his video down below because he explains
everything obviously because it's his
palette duh and let me go ahead and open
it up here is what it looks like and I
really love the packaging I can sit here
and do this all day honestly if you gave
me the opportunity to I could just sit
here and do this the whole time I like
how it's very personal to him and
eyes and then here is the back says
lunar beauty lice of drag and then here
is what the actual palette itself looks
like I already used the brush I tried to
put it back in here for the sake of
refilling this part but here is what it
looks like as you can see it's divided
between neutrals and super bright colors
so I decide to give you guys and look
using the neutral side as well as the
bright side so yeah that is what we're
doing today so if you guys want to see
both of the looks that I created then
just keep on watching and I hope you
guys enjoy it okay so before applying
any eyeshadow I'm gonna apply my P Lewis
eye base just to make sure that my eyes
are nice and primed now for eyeshadow
taking this morphe e27 i believe i'm
gonna first take the shade sickening and
i'm using this as my transition shade
and as you can see it's just a very
subtle tint and that's what I want as
the base for the rest of my eyeshadows
next I'm taking mug and this is a nice
Brown and I'm gonna just kind of put
this on my eye in a winged out motion
and I really love this shade because I
feel like from this eyeshadow it's
pulling both warm tones and cool tones
and it could be pulling a little bit
warm because of the sickening underneath
it and then I'm gonna take one of my
favorite shadows in the entire palette
honestly and this is trade and I would
describe trade as I mean what you see
it's just kind of like a purpley
burgundy it's just so pretty I feel like
it went so good with this look and I
could definitely see me incorporating
this specific shadow and multiple looks
because it's just so perfect it's so
perfectly warm and then I'm taking a
little bit more of mug and just kind of
softening out my crease and just
building onto that eye shadow because I
putted eyes and I want to make sure that
my shadow is still visible and then I'm
taking hunty and just flushing it into
the inner corner of the eye and I mean
that was just optional I just want to
make sure to use all the shades and then
after doing that since that part was so
easy and I'm just applying mug on the
entire bottom part of the eye and then
I'm gonna apply trade
the outer corner of the eye just to
match up with the top out of my eye and
this is a makeup Shack t13 brush next
I'm taking a little bit of cake face and
I'm just popping it on top of the inner
part of my eye and in terms of cake face
because I'm sure that people want to
review on the white eyeshadow and
probably the black as well I definitely
wouldn't consider cake face the whitest
white that I've used it's still very
nice and I'm gonna use it in the brow
bone later so you're able to see it more
but it's definitely not the whitest
white that I've tried out to work on
this crease I'm gonna take more of my
pea Louise I based on a dose of colors
concealer brush and I am just applying
that all to where I am going to apply my
next eye shadow once I have that on I'm
gonna take beat and I'm just gonna pack
this on to my lid and I really like beet
actually I feel like it has like the
perfect amount of shimmer but not too
chunky and I feel like that's important
especially like with a hooded lid
because I don't know sometimes I feel
like when the the glitter particles of
an eyeshadow are too chunky it doesn't
last long on my lid but this one is like
a really nice sheen and I like that
about this eyeshadow next I was trying
to figure out how to incorporate shaddy
which is the black eyeshadow in the
palette without making the look too dark
because I want it to just be like a kind
of like a daytime wearable look so what
I did was I took a Mac 263 brush and my
morphe setting mist and I dipped into
shady and sprayed my brush to basically
create a wing with eyeshadow and it
really came out really nice because
since the eyeshadow was mapped the Wayne
came out just really nice and flat and
matte and it was surprisingly really
easy to do it was actually easier than
using some of my cream liners because I
just feel like you just don't feel as
scared of messing up because eyeshadow
is so much more easy to remove than a
cream liner is after that taking the
brush that's inside the palette because
I want to use it I am taking a mixture
of cake face and sickening and the
reason I'm doing a mixture is because
cake base on his own will be far too
powerful for my brow bone it's gonna be
really white so I'm
just mixing in that sickening to create
a really nice subtle brow bone highlight
and I think that it looked gorgeous if
you ask me I like how it turned out and
then that is the eye shadow done and I
applied some Ardell whispies and then
for the lip color I'm taking this makeup
forever pencil and this is limitless
Brown and I am just gonna apply this to
the rim of my lips and then smooth it
out and then on top of that I'm applying
a fin t beauty's snakeskin lip Luminizer
just to complete this look so here you
have look number one and really you can
pair with any lip color I just want to
use snakeskin because those calling my
name
but here is this nice neutral look using
the neutral side of the palate and now
we're gonna jump into the colorful side
I'm gonna start this look just like I
started the first one using my P Louise
eye base and I highly recommend this
space because I feel like my eyeshadow
last all day
I don't crease up I don't get oily lids
none of that it's really good and then
I'm gonna apply some banana powder
underneath my eye to catch any fallout
just in case the first shadow I'm taking
is chi-chi and I was talking because I
was trying to figure out what steps I
took to get the original eye look at it
but I'm taking chi-chi on a morphine 30
brush and I'm just packing that on and
then once I have that nice impact on I
am just going to blend away and as you
guys can see I like to kind of have my
eye shadow winged out a little bit
because the flatter is my eye shape so I
always pull my eye shadow outwards just
because I like how it looks
next I'm taking that beautiful yellow
shade and it's called campy and I'm
taking this and I'm applying it directly
on top of chi-chi because as you can see
because science as I mix it on top it's
creating this really fiery orange and
it's just creating the most beautiful
transition and then on my lid I'm taking
snatch'd and I am just packing this on
and slowly working it into the crease
just a little bit just so that it blends
well with Kai Kai
and then like always I like to take the
shadows I use on the top and apply them
to the bottom so I'm taking campi and
then chi-chi and then on the outer
corner I'm gonna take pageant queen
because I'm also going to apply pageant
queen which is a really nice purple to
the outer part of my eye on top just so
I can get that really nice sunset effect
so as you can see I'm just taking that
pageant queen and applying get as close
to the inner part of my outer part of my
eye as possible so I can have like a
little little pop purple and then after
I'm done with that I'm gonna take some
mascara this has benefits back out bang
mascara and then I'm gonna pop on my
lashes and these are the exact same ones
the Ardell whispies and then that is it
for this couple look so that is it for
this video I hope you guys enjoyed it
again I'm so sorry I had to do voiceover
I just don't know I feel so bad about it
cuz I'm just like oh like I love talking
to you guys I love just I love the
interaction of being able to just talk
whereas a voiceover you're so limited
and it's just like I just hate voiceover
but I hope you guys didn't mind it I
just was really determined to get this
up for you guys I'm just so exhausted
but I'm just trying to keep it together
and I hope you guys are happy with the
looks if you happen to recreate the
looks then be sure to tag me in it
because I love when you guys recreate my
looks and yeah let me know your thoughts
on the palette if you do purchase it and
if this video made you want to purchase
it let me know as well I just just
talked to me that's what I want but
other than that thank you guys so much

next one peace out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
