so for today's video I will be doing a
little review and I want to say well I
feel like I'll probably just end up just
playing around the products and I pray
if I can get to say my thoughts but I'm
gonna try to which is why I said review
because I'm just excited to use it and
this is let me just grab one of the
items Mac and Jeremy Scott they did a
collab and isn't so cute they're just a
bunch of stuff so I want to review it
because I saw it I saw it I was just
like wow this is so cute it's such
unique packaging so I want to try it so
if you guys want to see that then just
keep on watching okay so first things
first let's talk about what's in the
collection so here is the box that this
came in it's super cute
it's so cute it's a 29 I shut appellate
but it's so cool because like I mean
just when I saw it I was okay like what
on earth is this but it's so cool and
then this is how this looks so it comes
with the plastic and this has the names
of the shadows I'm going to take that
off to show you guys the palette do
really nice and colorful and then you
have the lip palette and this is the
packaging for it and then this is the
actual product itself go it open it up
well this is what it looks like it also
comes with the plastic as well and
honestly I've never really been a huge
fan of lip palettes because I never
really use all the colors but we're
gonna use it today and we're just gonna
see how it works out and then lastly we
have this it's so cute and this is I'm
dropping so this is the cheek palette
this is called acoustica and this is the
packaging that comes and like little CD
open it up this is what this looks like
and honestly just looking at the colors
I just I don't think they're gonna show
up on my skin but we're gonna try it out
we're actually gonna try this first
because I just want to get out of the
way but I don't mean it's gonna show up
in my skin so let's just go ahead and
just let's just see let's see I'm gonna
go ahead and take the contour shade
first
we're getting some contour do you know
see it I mean it's very light but it's
not that bad I'm not that mad at
actually hmm okay okay I feel like the
more you builds it up the better it
looks now granted if you have a deeper
complexion than me yeah this is
definitely not gonna show up and that
sucks you know I wish they may I wish
they would have liked me like maybe two
I mean yes you build it up it's kind of
showing up okay not bad in fact I think
I actually really like the color because
it's not too warm but it's not too cool
tone so I'm actually really pleasantly
surprised by that it does not look that
bad okay cool okay so now I wanna go
ahead and just do the blush as well
since we're in this palette this is the
blush okay oh wow
you know when looking at this palette I
was like there's no way in heck that's
gonna work out because it looks really
light but then when you apply it you get
so much more pigment then I was
expecting okay okay me not overdo it but
okay cool and now let's go ahead and
just do the highlight over here oh
that's a little bit powdery as you can
see it's kind of re becoming a mess
don't like that but let's go ahead and
use that
okay so I mean the highlight it's
nothing really special but it's not bad
either so let's go ahead and move into
the eye shadow okay so I went ahead and
prime my eyes with some concealer now
it's going to open up this palette boom
okay what kind of stuff am i dropping
kind of look do I want to do hmm
I think I'm do something like peachy cuz
it's for the cute so I'm going to take
these two shades right here let's take
the light pink one first okay one thing
that I will point out is that okay let
me go ahead and show you guys so as you
can see Bo for one it's already gained
dirty but like my brush is bigger than
the what do you call it iron shadow
itself so I'm front of myself how to do
this which is causing me to have to dip
in over and over again to build this up
so I'm not a huge fan of that but I mean
I like the concept of the palette
because it's really cute but I would
prefer a bigger pan but the colors
pretty so we can't be too upset but it
is kind of like we're kind of like
scrubbing to the side to get the
eyeshadow okay so you definitely have to
dip a lot of time because the pans are
so small so be mindful of that if you
don't mind that and that's fine biting
the shadow color itself is really pretty
so I'm not that mad about it i'ma go
ahead and take the orange
ooh I like that ooh that's a pretty odd
you could see how pretty it is even on
the brush might I add that I love the
fact that this palette comes with a
big-ass mirror and it's a really nice
mirror at that I want to go ahead and
add that really nice man may use this
just for my regular makeup even when I'm
not using the palette okay yeah that's a
really pretty Orange I like that a lot
now let's see what does ELISA wanna do a
list is gonna take the yellow I don't
know why but I just want to eat the
yellow okay I mean granted it would have
been smart to apply the yellow first so
I can see the pigmentation I mean I
don't think it's that bad actually
kind of softened up my orange a bit now
what does ELISA wanna take next ELISA
wants to do a simple root but she feels
obligated to do a bright look because of
all the bright colors but she doesn't do
what to do a bright look cuz she wants
to do a simple dope because she said for
do I have to do color
this blue is calling my name I think
we're gonna use it okay we're use a
little bit of color today you know I
don't want to use color okay
okay so this looks pretty you do have to
build a little bit to get some
pigmentation and I did notice that it
completely got rid of most of my orange
but I mean the color itself is pretty so
let me go ahead and do to the right I'm
gonna take the lighter blue on top of
that color now for the lid I'm not sure
what I want to put on it but I don't
mmm what I want to do I think I'm gonna
take the green where I take the green
let's see okay I think something tells
me that I should like spray the brush a
little bit first and then pack it on
this is actually coming out really
pretty and I wasn't expecting it to take
this colorful turn but I'm not upset at
all actually we like it a lot and I'm
gonna go ahead and take the fluffy
blending brush and just add some cream
right here too now I'm gonna go ahead
and apply some mascara
so for the lip palette I do wish that it
came with a brush because now I have to
find a brush to get some of this out but
I mean it's okay I suppose let me go
ahead and find a brush okay so I think
for lips I'm going to go ahead and take
this shade first
okay I might not very impressed by the
color payoff but we'll move on I'm gonna
go ahead and take this shade right here
let's see let me go ahead and just dip
into some of the other colors just to
show you guys the payoff it's alright
yeah there okay the lapels okay even
that color I mean granted the colors are
pretty it's just okay like it's nothing
like oh my gosh
I need this in my life so I mean this
look how it came out cute but I mean I
can easily make that with any other
product that I have you know I mean so
just tell me you guys my final thoughts
on the collection I would recommend if
you were to get any of the three
products available for the collection I
would get the eyeshadow palette I'm sure
you guys saw that coming because those
colors were really pretty granted the
size of the pan was small so it was
tricky getting my brush once I got it on
I think that it looks really pretty it
blends really nice and I liked it a lot
and I can definitely see myself using it
again in terms of the little cheek
palette that ended up and pressing me a
lot as well unfortunately because of the
fact the contour shade is a little bit
more light if you do have a deeper
complexion you cannot use it so that's a
bummer but I mean just speaking for
myself personally I do like it and I
think that it gave me a really nice
natural contour so I can see myself
using it again and then obviously I just
mentioned the lip palette was a man for
me
I personally want to get it I mean I
would just get it for the sake of the
packaging which honestly I think that a
lot of people they get matte collections
because the packaging is to die for and
they like to collect it so if you're
doing it to collect I think the entire
collection is super cute but if you're
getting it to use it I would highly
recommend getting the eyeshadow palette
because it's so cute and I like how my
look turned out so that is it for this
little video if you guys liked it be
sure to give it a thumbs up and let me
know on
