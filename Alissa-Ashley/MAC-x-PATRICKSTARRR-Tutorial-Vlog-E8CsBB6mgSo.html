so for today's video I'm gonna show you
guys how to achieve this look right here
and it's a tutorial technically but
really it is just my reason to use the
new Mac and Patrick Starr collaboration
because I'm such a huge fan of Patrick
he's a great friend he's a great person
and just a little quick story my first
encounter with Patrick
it was in Miami and we were motives
cosmetics and I remember I just kind of
I was so nervous to say you think to him
because of the time I was so like you
know I didn't talk to anyone because
like you just never know how people are
gonna like respond and he told me that I
should talk more in my videos because if
you've been here for a while I used to
do all voiceover I never used to speak
he said talk more new videos he said you
seemed so like nice he said you could
tell you have great personality you know
talk more and I was like hmm okay so I
start talking more and that was like the
best advice I've ever gotten from anyone
because now you guys connect with me
more and I'm just more happy and it's
just I don't know it's good for me to
talk a little bit more and it's much
more personal so thank you pat for that
advice and it's still in my head to this
day which is why I try to not do any
water so many voiceovers but anywho I'm
super excited for Patrick I cannot
imagine anyone else any other influencer
who is more deserving of this
collaboration it just so fitting it's so
perfect for him giving his story so I'm
very excited for him as you could tell
I'm gonna go ahead and show you guys how
I got this look using these stuff inside
of the collaboration and you saw that
good stuff for you guys if you guys want
to see how I got this look and just my
little input or review on the powder the
Colossus lipsticks all that good stuff
then just keep on watching and hope you
guys enjoy it okay so the first thing we
do is go ahead and prime I'm gonna take
my Sicily primer and this is what I used
in my last video was the Urban Decay one
yeah a lot of you guys like what primer
use I was like oops I forgot to I forgot
to include that just a Sicily primer
oh geez for foundation I go ahead and
use my Tom Ford waterproof own
well you're very blue easy tonight first
this lead in Tom Ford but you guys never
went to that video where I was trying a
lot of high-end stuff those two are my
favorite everything I've tried and the
Chanel bronzer I literally use them so
often you guys yeah I thought you guys
see it a lot so I just left you guys
know I do use the stuff that I buy
I don't just put some more on I don't
just buy it for the sake of a video and
just dump them I end up loving them
which by the way you guys want a video
bunch of products I love that keep
buying and then use my Tarte to quickie
blending sponge to blend it in to
conceal I'm gonna go ahead and take the
Urban Decay all night air concealer and
this is a medium dark warm like I used
in the video because I mean it lasted
really good like I don't know like
sometimes we'll concealers especially at
nighttime when it gets a little cold
they'll end up getting chapped on me cuz
my skin's a little more dry but this one
literally didn't do any of that so I'm
absolutely here for it apply that and
then I go ahead and blend it in
now the powder I should have had some
more prepared because now I'm a julep
right go under and blend because I'm
letting it sit for a little bit I'm
gonna take well this is the PR pact I
want to show you guys it's all 3d I'm
gonna go ahead and take me powder let me
go and get it out I'm gonna take the
Mack Patrick Starr setting powder and
let's see what it says
Patrick's powder looks so cute PP Patras
powder you get one zero
oh one out I'm so bad at being
these you get one ounce and yea this is
what it looks like we go ahead and open
it up let's go ahead and dump some into
the cap okay so looking at the powder it
seems like it has a pinky tint to it if
I were to let me go ahead and show you
guys so you guess it's you I mean let's
get that done
okay I know if you guys see this but
this is very banana II and this is more
pinky can you guys see that I hope you
guys can I know they're both white my
backdrops white I'm trying to show you
guys oh my god you can see it from right
here I think
this one's more pinky and this is more
yellow so not gonna lie I am scared
because I am a yellow girl and I like
yellow but we're gonna try it out
because we love Patrick and I think it's
gonna work out I think we're gonna do
good let's go ahead and do that as you
can see it's a little lines got to go
over and blend a little bit and we're
gonna use this to set my under eye and
the rest of my face
this looks pretty good like it's not
really like I don't know at first I was
scared it was gonna turn me a little bit
pinky maybe a little bit a she but I
mean yeah I don't think that I look
actually at all what do you guys think
it looks pretty good it looks like how I
normally would set it so let's go ahead
and do the rest of the face first I look
at my brush but I think this is really
settling it to my skin really well so I
don't need a brush I'm just like keep
patting it with a sponge and let that be
that cool okay so I am liking that at
first I was scared because it looks like
it's gonna be really pinky you never
really know what setting powders but it
looks really good I like outs of my face
my face still looks like my color it's
not giving me a great overcast so I am
here for it yes I'm here for it I'm
gonna go ahead and do my brows off
camera because I am on a time crunch
because I take hello Wanda you ready so
I'm gonna go ahead and do the off-camera
and we're gonna play with the eyeshadows
and the lips on camera okay let me do my
brows okay so as you guys can see I went
ahead and did one eye off-camera Patrick
did release two eyeshadow palettes with
Mac and here's what they look like and
I'm gonna go ahead and use this one is
Patrick star gold get er to start and go
ahead and just prime my lid using the
colour-pop nofilter concealer next
taking a dose of colors blending brush
I'm gonna take this shape right here
first and I put that in the crease areas
too lid or put in the crease area first
I'm just gonna sweep that all over and
we're actually gonna put on the lid as
well
only the inner corner though I'm gonna
go ahead and take this shade right here
and we're going to apply that to the
crease as well mainly on the outer
corner
and never messed up to this deep nice
pretty purpley maroon ishe we're going
to pop that on the outer part of the
crease and the lid
basically the whole area just pack that
on just like that
I'm packing it on first I'm gonna go
ahead and blend it I just want it to be
very concentrate on the outer part of
the eye then taking a more PG 12 I'm
gonna go ahead and supply the same shade
of a thigh
now I'm gonna go ahead and pop on some
mascara
now for the lip color we have so many
options I'm not gonna do the red only
because I have a red lip coming up for
you guys I think I might do one of the
little kind of I think I might do I
don't know I'm kind of like cuz I like
both with the Pink's let's just try on
both okay so this one is Mama star it's
gonna apply that that's really pretty
I like that because the most pink nudes
active Brown lip liner but this is good
I can only keep on this but I want to
add the other one to use as much Mac
Patrick Starr as we can let's see which
one's this one this was Patrick Wu and
it's a red and we go ahead and show you
guys
Patrick blue is a red or not using red
like I mentioned and then here is the
Patrick blue gloss want you guys that as
well very deep anybody breathing and I
let's see this is she better work I
think I would go ahead and pop she bit
of her grand Center vide this is pretty
here are what the gloss look like
swatched and I think I'm go with the
lighter color for today or for tonight

better work for the gloss

great I'm gonna go ahead and put on my
clothes and yeah we're gonna go ahead
