for today's video I decided I'm gonna go
ahead and do a full face using my
favorite products of 2017 I thought this
be very fun to do because I don't know
what else to do let's be honest too so I
decided this would be a really fun video
because I actually do want to talk about
my new products so you guys want to see
if anyone watching it hope you guys
enjoy it that was like the shortest
intro them all time he'll you mm-hmm
okay so before stepping into makeup I do
want to go ahead and share with you guys
my favorite skincare products obviously
are I went ahead and wash my face and
everything so we're not gonna redo that
because that's just lets do help stuff
but my favorite cleanser of the year
that I purchased I want to say four
times was the Neogene green tea cleanser
and here it is here's what looks like
you can find exif aura that made it to
my favorite cleanser because I bought it
so much and it got rid all my makeup it
phone definitely nice and didn't dry out
my skin and I just liked it a lot now on
to moisturizer okay this one was hard
because I go through a lot of
moisturizer
I'm moisturize a lot but one moisturizer
that I bought about three or four times
the same as a cleanser what's the last
don't do it my belief aqua balm
moisturizer this moisturizer is the best
I love it so much I have it on right now
this one is just the best for every
season I'm used in the winter summer
spring in just part for every single
season so this one need it as my
favorite moisturizer between 17 and now
let's get into makeup first one start
out with priming and my favorite primer
and this one was very very easy for me
because I just love this primer a lot
it's a bougie okay it cost a lot of
money but it is the Sicily primer I love
this stuff so much as soon as it entered
my life I was located here to stay
I still have some that's one the reason
why I like it because when I first
bought it the bottle is so small I'm
Mike
this is gonna go by superfast especially
for the price point I was located like
there's no way that it's gonna last long
it's so small but I still have some and
I've had this for over six months so I
like this primer so much it blends well
and it kind of like what do you call it
what's the word for it it has a great
relationship with every single
foundation that i pair it with is what
i'm trying to say because some primers
they don't mix well with some of my
foundations this one works with all of
them so I'm gonna go ahead and apply my
primer now cuz I'm talking now for
foundation I feel like you guys gonna
guess it because I mean I just love it a
lot and my favorite foundation of the
your is the Finn T Beauty Pro filter
foundation and the reason why okay
granted I do you know I'm not the
biggest fan of having to mix two
foundations that happens to always be my
case I always have to freakin mix
foundations but I've noticed that this
foundation it lasts the longest in terms
of just like the wear of it and it looks
beautiful it doesn't make me look dry it
doesn't dry my skin it just it just
looks so good it looks so good in photos
I look airbrushed and also I'm able to
mix them with other foundations and it
looks super duper good still so I just
love talking a lot I use the shades 370
and 410 and then to blend it out I'm
going to take my favorite sponge of the
year and this is the Tarte quickie
blending sponge
I have hell of these funders I have like
10 or 15 of them they're literally all
laying around I barely use Beauty
blenders anymore unless I have to and
I'm like laughs these Beauty Blender
because I love this sponge so much it's
the best sponge in the world in my
opinion so I go ahead and use this to
blend it up you know it looks so fries
next for concealer I actually have a
combination so I use two concealers and
those give me light together because the
formula of both are different but they
balance each other out and I can also
use both of these concealers on their on
their own but I like them together a lot
and they are the tarp shape tip
concealer and the color pop no fields of
concealer this one who I need a breakout
on my new ones because this one's
literally like almost done and then a
little bit of shape tape I'm gonna go
ahead and blend it out and not to go
ahead and set it in place my favourite
under-eye and forehead basically
highlighted area of my face powder is
the makeup revolution banana powder so
I'm go ahead and use this to set my face
I love this powder because it is
extremely affordable it's like eight
bucks and it lasts long time I have like
three of them and they're all still
pretty full and they're really really
nice finish so I like the bright that's
not too thick or too thin it sets in
place
and it looks really good
and then my favorite powder for the
entire face is do you know it do you
know the breath do you know the powder
do you know what I mean if you're
knee-deep I don't know it but if you are
an OG you better have set it out loud I
live no seriously I love these are for
my Christmas in the shaytan am i more
PEP eight this is like my holy grail
combo if you did not see that coming
and even watch me for a while how dare
you I like to buff this over my entire
face to give me a airbrush look yeah I
don't know where I was going with that
next for my brows my favorite brow
product of the year is definitely my eco
brow and I don't have the cap for it so
you so much it's just sitting right here
I know that's hella dirty but I love
this freakin product it is eco brow and
it's their brow pomade in the shade Rita
I like that shade specifically because
it just matches my blonde the most it
gives me a nice little dose of warm and
cool tone and one in my opinion because
if I'm too cool tone it just looks a
little gray to warm it looks a little
red but this like a perfect little
mixture I like this product a lot and
like to use the Mac 263 brush to apply
it
you
next we'll go ahead and take my
colour-pop concealer I'm gonna use that
to prime my eyes rig into the eye shadow
now for eye shadow honestly this was a
little bit hard okay wasn't hard but it
was kind of a thing where I mean I used
so much different shadow and different
shadow palettes throughout the whole
year so I located which one was the one
where I was like ooh I love that one
and it's just the best in terms of
creating multiple looks and honestly I
would say that the path that I use the
most often after getting it is the
morphine there do not aid you see it the
more every 39 eight is my choice for a
palette of the year my mom loves it she
has one and she's like oh I love my 39
eight palette and I like it as well I
love love love love let me open it up
just the variety of shades and I
especially love this little center row I
just love this palette the most in terms
of variety because it has some nice
colorful shades in it and very nice
neutral warm earthy tones and as well
and you guys know I love that so this is
my palette of the year and my blending
brush of the year is not morphe which I
mean that's shocking because I have a
code so you would think okay Alyssa's
gonna go you know me know my favorite
I'm so goofy my favorite blending brush
of the year is the dose of colors
blending brush I use this thing every
single day I bought one because they'd
already sit one because I liked it so
much if I want to buy another one under
buy more this brush is so I love it so
much I use it every single look so I go
ahead and use this to apply my morphe
shadow which I do have code I do my code
I'm gonna go ahead and take this shade
right here I'm doing a simple look today
I don't really feel like doing a lot of
shadow I don't have any plans actually
do have plants I think I don't know my
life so sporadic but me open
I'm gonna go ahead and apply this in my
crease yeah I love this palette
Emma's blending brush and let this brush
so much and imma go ahead and take this
shade right here and a little bit of
this brown goodness right here I'm gonna
pop that first shade on the lid and I'm
gonna go ahead and apply those same
shades on the bottom next for mascara
this is fairly new as you like only like
a couple months maybe two three months
but it still is my favorite because I
love it more than anything I've ever
used and this is the Kiko Milano mascara
this is fall 2.0 it says fall 2.0
mascara I hope I get some more even
though is it still fall I doubt it
I love this mascara so much it makes my
bottom lashes look really long which is
like Rare and it also like doesn't clump
my lashes they're just good
have not decided yet if I want upon some
lashes so we're gonna go ahead and move
to the rest of the face for bronzer we
got another bougie option and this is
the Chanel natural it's hella long oh
it's unnatural
should now healthy glow sheer color let
miss me I don't know how frickin
pronounce it and this is number 70 and
you're probably listen that looks
brand-new it is this one is my old one
let me show you guys it's hella beat-up
and gusty and I've hit pan this stuff is
so magical is so warm it's so just like
light on the face it gives me more why
am i doing all this it's just so good so
I bought a second one and it's my
favorite bronzer year okay don't talk
like that let's put on the project I'm
such a goofball it's because I'm hungry
so I have to really goofy hungry but
yeah we live for this bronzer now for
blush my favorite blush I have two so
we're gonna go ahead and double today
because I have a cream and a powder for
cream I love this milk makeup it's a lip
and cheek it is rally it's so good she
entered my life you know recently but
she's taken over 2018 she's amazing I'm
talking like it's a human but this stuff
is so good
watch out baby in my cheeks look watch
this take my fingers two fingers watch
this watch this
you guys always wondering listen why you
so radiant it's from within but it's
also much
yes it's so good it's one of the only
cream products that doesn't pick up the
rest of my makeup because some of them
are too creamy so it picks up I make it
what makes me look not flawless but this
one is so good and it's so radiant and
then for my powder blush my favorite
blush of the year has got to be benefits
California I love this blush so much
it's so radiant as well so I'm gonna
pack on the radiance by applying some of
this and this is a morphe 3 brush it's
more radiant it's basically like the
powder form of the cream blush basically
if you can tell that's a highlighter it
is hard oh okay so this was a little bit
hard because I have a lot of
highlighters that I like a lot a lot but
if we're speaking in terms of uniqueness
and glow enos and goodness and I always
got a lot of compliments when I wear it
and people are like what is that I know
which one I need to show you guys and
this is the Laura Geller
baked gelato swirl illuminator and
diamond dust and this stuff is so good
because it's one of those highlighters
that is just perfect for everyday wear
in my opinion because do you know how
some highlighters that are like gold
they're too much because they're like
boom in your face this one has like this
kind of pinky iridescent so it looks
good for everyday and as well as like
glam looks for the night time wherever
you want to wear it it's just the
perfect highlight in my opinion and it's
unique if I can open it and grant it you
probably won't be able to see it much
because kind of like it's blending with
my blush a little bit because they're
both pink but when my face hits the
light it looks so good
and there's lint on my brush and then
are you noticing something I decided to
go ahead and do lashes based on the lip
color going to do and these lashes are
Lily lashes in the style con but another
lash that I loved loved loved this year
is from the branded clay beauty and the
style lucky I'm just out of them and I
don't know how yes I bought like ten
pairs I don't know how I love them but
they're the bomb a little bit more
dramatic than this is there more more
subtle even though this is contra Matic
these are more subtle but I love that
latch as well
and then lastly actually not lasted
because we're gonna set our face but
second to lastly is the lip color and
honestly I have a lot of lip colors that
I really liked this year I can't really
like just say okay this is the best lip
product of my life because I have so
many that I always use and there's
different sort of formulas there's like
regular lipsticks glosses liquid
lipsticks but this one is my favorite
and liquid lipstick formula and I really
really hope that they make more in this
formula and this is the thin tea Beauty
sunlit paint because it's just it blew
me away
just like the liquidy it was just like
it was heaven so I'm gonna go ahead and
use this and also kind of holiday so I'm
go ahead and put it on
see how it will do my whole lips loud
dipping back in yeah that's why it's
about that's like because that's so
rare it's not something my lips so big
you have to go this one's like boom boom
what am i doing I don't know and in my
favorite setting spray of the year that
I've purchased I gave one to a friend
though so that mean that counts right
like they actually give two we I can
give one to our Nell and jasmine oh no
but I like it's the morphe continuous
setting mist let's spray rvs now shall
we let's be
okay and then here you have the finished
