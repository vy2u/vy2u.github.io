so today's video / Twitter's request and
also my Instagram poll you guys should
follow me on my social medias because
I'm very interactive on those and I ask
the people what they want and I'd give
them what they want so follow me on
Twitter especially cuz I do a lot of
interacting on there anywho enough of
the self rule from other social medias
today's video is going to be a how-to
video on taking bomb super 5 selfies
with your iPhone or other phone you have
your phone because I mean honestly
speaking we probably all have some form
of a phone not all of us have a super HD
camera or a selfie camera so I want to
go ahead and start and the basic level
of using your phone because that's
usually what everyone has and I want to
be able to be helpful for you guys
because you guys want yourself used to
be popped into so if you guys want to
see all my tips and tricks then just
keep on watching and this plane is
killing my BOTS but hope you guys are
ready first things first you want to
make sure that you have a good location
so without further ado I don't know why
I'm introducing like that I'm gonna go
ahead and switch over to my other camera
and some voiceover because we're gonna
go ahead by word I mean me I'm gonna go
ahead and show you guys locations to
avoid and locations that you want to get
your popping selfies so let's go ahead
and go to my locations yeah
okay let's bounce cute other camera when
it comes to your location
obviously you not want to be anywhere
too dark or shadowy because it is not
gonna look good but if you are in a
situation where you are in a dark area
use your flash and your back camera but
I personally try to avoid this kind of
lighting you also don't want to be
anywhere that's too overexposed because
your face is not gonna be even it's
gonna be a lot of shadow
yes our skin looks great but it's just a
lot of shadow I can barely little mice
so you do not want this lighting either
unless the look you're going for the
best lighting scenario and my personal
opinion is when you are an indirect
sunlight and preferably standing
right in front of a window and I love
love love love love using this specific
window in my apartment to get my good
lighting even though my cats that's
their area that's their territory
but it just gives perfect lighting and
if you do not happen to like the
lighting you could always tap your phone
and brighten it just a little bit I do
this sometimes when I feel like it's a
little bit too dark but that's only on
occasion but I'm gonna showing you guys
that feature in case you not know of it
and then I'm pretty sure I saw a spider
also when using your window for lighting
you want to face the window do not face
like behind it because look at how
terrible this lighting looks so turn
around and get that great lighting and
it's just perfect
and I'm gonna go ahead and show you guys
another example from another window and
this windows in my kitchen but still the
same setting basically in direct
sunlight you're still getting that
brightness from the Sun being out during
the day but it's not direct it's not
blinding you you never want the Sun to
blind you unless I mean maybe that's the
look you're going for but for an ideal
makeup selfie where I want to be very
even I love love love this setting try
it out if you have not already because
it's the bomb also since this window is
smaller I like to be a little bit closer
to it I'm going to show you guys in a
second that when I walk away from it the
lighting is not that great and the same
rule applies to this window do not face
your back to it because you're gonna get
shitty lighting and yeah that is it for
our little location demo now let's go
ahead and get into the editing what I'm
sure you guys are excited for okay so I
went ahead and taken my photos and now
I'm gonna go ahead and edit it and let's
go ahead and open face to it wait let me
do a screen recording duh
and here is the base photo and as you
can see I mean there's nothing wrong
with it but it can look better and
that's honestly like the whole purpose
of like when I edit it's not a factor of
oh you know I feel ugly oh I feel this I
feel that I just know that it could look
better in the sense that it could be
bright and more vibrant it could be more
inviting to the eyes because honestly
speaking the iPhone photos especially in
selfie mode they're kind of doubled in
my opinion and I mean even like I don't
know I can just
so I can look bit too in the sense that
I'm gonna look more popping and vibrant
and that is why I want you guys to take
away from this video enough talking
first I'll go into the smoothing tool
and as you guys know like I have pretty
decent skin but I did just get a facial
so it's kind of leaving my skin and
needed bit bumpy or bumpier than usual
so I'm gonna go ahead and just slightly
smooth over and as you can see I'm just
doing this you never want to just go in
and go crazy otherwise you look crazy
you want to go and just kind of lightly
tap over areas I do this whenever I'm
having a breakout like right now my skin
like after that facial it's not so much
the face but I did it it's me wear
makeup after the facial when I was
supposed to so whatever I'm gonna go
ahead and just tap over little areas on
my skin see my getting real close you
could see the breakout nuns they go up
restore yourself back to normal please
somebody go ahead and just go over the
skin just a little bit I never like to
over smooth but I'll show you guys a
little trick on how to smooth it but
bring back texture so you do not look
like a butterball okay it's my trick
it's my little my little secret okay so
here's we're looking like as you can see
I'm tapping the before and after and
there's barely any change and that's I
like to do I never like to over smooth
my skin because it's not realistic I
mean my skin is very smooth but like I
don't know I just don't like to overdo
it because then I just yeah I like it
then crazy next I'm gonna go ahead and
just go into my detail tool and you know
like tap over my brows a little bit see
I'm adding a little more detail to the
brows I like to give the effect of you
know I have hair even though I don't
have a lot of brow hairs I like to do
that I'll go ahead and tap over my
little highlight in the flap you fold
and a little bit over my eye just to
give them more of a twinkle a little
sparkle as well as my lashes to give
them more pop I'm also going to go over
my nose ring because it has makeup on
anyway I've actually so I want to make
it more detail guy did not spend the
money on it for it to not be detailed
and then that is all I do in Phase two
and I'm gonna go ahead and save it to my
camera roll and we're gonna jump into my
next app the next
that I use religiously I have to have
this app at all times is vsco cam go
ahead and upload to Bissell cameras you
can see other photos of me are inside a
vsco cam because I literally use it all
the time
I'm gonna go and as you can see i'm
scrolling i'm trying to look and talk
the same time you can see i have all of
these filters now with these filters you
do have to purchase them for like four
dollars three dollars for a bundle and
honestly my favorite one is the one the
see the see bundle so buy that one oh my
gosh buy that one because i literally
use the same filter in every single
photo now granted some of the other ones
look fine as you can see see 7e one
looks really great east 7 looks really
great each one adds a different tone to
the photo I'm just kind of bouncing
around to show you guys how it looks
each one adds a different sort of vibe
but my favorite one is c3 I lose my
voice I need some the drink I'm talking
a lot now c3 is my favorite one because
as you can see you want to take away c3
and when I put it back on
I still look the same but I just looked
more vibrant and I never want to change
the tone of my skin too much and
everyone do too much I just want to look
more vibrant so as you can see when i
add c3 it just brightens overall photo
it makes the attention more me versus
the background so see how I'm like boom
c3 no c3 boom c3 you get it and then I
never allow it to be all the way till
it's full like this full strength
I go down to about 7 each time sometimes
lower but see how now it's not as
intense but still has that in Factor
then I go ahead and save that I jumped
into the other part of the app where it
allows you to control the exposure the
contrast all that stuff the grain
because honestly I feel like a lot of
people use other what do you call it
apps to grade their photos and it's too
much visco has the best grain in my
personal opinion because even in light
app another app I use not as often
anymore another I have discovered Bisco
but that one I don't like
it's too much grain so if you want to
grin your photo do it right now I'm
going to show you guys that right now so
I'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna go to
grain first and I never ever ever ever
ever ever use over three point three
point grain ever
I usually stew down to two point five
and sometimes I'll go to three but
anything over three is doing the most
because as you can see it barely made it
made the slightest difference you can't
see it but that's the point and then
when you zoom in it gives you the the
feel of Photoshop skin without Photoshop
so after you do your little smoothing
work and they you put the grade at the
detail everyone's gonna think your
skin's poppin that's my secret I mean my
skin is poppin don't get me wrong but
the grain it just does something that
adds a nice professional feel which is
why everyone always wants to know oh my
god what camera are using and I'm like
I'm using my phone girl boy whoever you
I'm using my phone and then I'm gonna go
ahead and use saturation and just add a
little more color to myself I usually go
to one because the saturation is really
intense so you do not want to overdo it
like you don't want to like look crazy
like that you do not want to do that so
I've got about one sometimes lower than
one just add my color back you know who
I want my color I'm gonna go to the
exposure and as you can see I look a
little bright but I don't want to look
that bright so I'm gonna knock down the
exposure maybe about like 0.5 so see our
photo is looking good see that before
and after it's looking great
looky and then honestly speaking that's
all I do sometimes I mess with the
contrast a little bit I don't really
need to in this photo okay maybe a
little bit maybe like 0.5 to make it
more poppin but other than that that is
all I do and then I go ahead and save it
let's save it to my camera roll my
camera roll and that is how I edit my
there's a ghost okay that is how I edit
my photos I use only facetune a little
bit of smoothing do not overdo your
smoothing don't do it don't do it I have
to do it oh my gosh and do not overdo
your deeds
because some people they still do hella
detail and I'm just like that's hella
detail you do doggy all that damn detail
just go kid you know and that's why I'm
so goofy and that's fine and then you
hop into your visco and honestly
speaking those have only two apps that i
religiously use vsco and facetune not
facetune - I hate basting - I like face
- one so that's that's all I do
the things I want you guys to take away
from it is do not over smooth do not
over detail unless you want a cartoon
character and we don't want look like
that go into disco you see three you may
have to use other ones but I would
definitely recommend purchasing the C
the C bundle because they have the most
and I use those the most I use that one
and the Q bundle a lot but mainly you
just see three but it may vary depending
on your skin tone but definitely see
three I've used all my friends and they
all like it they all go by the bundles
like lc3 Mike I know and then a little
bit of grain do not over green because
then it's gonna be obvious that your
grain you do not want to be too obvious
then you grind your photo you want to be
so subtle great and it looks great and
that is that's it go ahead and give some
of my favorite selfies using c3 and
grain a moment because that's all I
freakin use I hope that these tips were
helpful I hope that you guys got
something from this video if you did be
sure to give it a big thumbs up and let
me know what else you guys would like to
see but other than that thank you guys
so much for watching and I'll see you
guys in my next video bye and may your
selfies be amazing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
