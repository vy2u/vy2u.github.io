based on the title of this video I'm
sure you guys already know what's going
to be this is a makeup do's and don'ts
video highlighting contour Edition and
I'm starting a series I'm super excited
about so if you want to see my tips then
just keep on watching and please
subscribe if you enjoy it the first do
that I'm going to recommend is priming
your skin and you want a primer skin
based on your skin type so if you have
oily skin you want to go for a
mattifying primer to control your oil
whereas my skin is dry so I like to
reach for the more radiant primers just
to make sure my skin is nice and
hydrated throughout the day
the second do is picking out the correct
foundation I recommend going to a
Sephora and getting matched as well as
getting some testers to take home before
you get your foundation because it's so
much more than picking the right shade
you also want to get the right finish so
since my skin is dry I aim to get more
dewy foundations as opposed to
mattifying ones because the matte ones
are going to make me look more dry does
that make sense I hope it does and you
also want to blend it down to your neck
so that it matches you know you don't
want to try to match your face color
because as you can see I'm more pale you
want to match your neck now on to our
don't you not want to pick a foundation
that is too dark for you and you also
want to make sure you pick a foundation
that is your tone I don't have any pink
toned foundations because I don't buy
them but I'm a yellow tone girl so I'm
not going to get a pink tone foundation
and this foundation is honestly not the
best I'm going to show you guys a little
bit later that end up turning gray on me
so stay tuned for that now color
correcting isn't a part of everyone's
routine however if you do color correct
make sure that you are using the proper
shade that targets your specific problem
also try to only target you know the
areas that actually need to be color
corrected oftentimes I see a lot of
people apply huge amounts of color
corrector I've once been a victim of it
I used to do it a lot but you don't
really need to do that because your
essentially just wasting product and
you're just spreading it because
honestly it's like I only want to color
correct the areas that need it not my
whole under eye because my whole under
eye doesn't need it you know what I mean
now for my due for concealer I'm just
going to dot on that concealer and a
triangle type of shape I'm also avoiding
putting that consider too closely to my
what do you call that my waterline
because I'm going to blend it upwards if
I put it too close to the waterline
which I have done before it's going to
make me a little more prone to creasing
because there's just so much concealer
in that area so I like to blend it
upwards and then outwards just to get
the most perfect under-eye conceal as
you can see it looks nice and just
smooth nothing too cakey I'm going to
get less creasing by doing so now for
the don't side as you can see I'm
applying entirely too much concealer
it's very thick I'm bringing it down too
much so I'm essentially highlighting
pretty much that whole half of my face
as opposed to just my under eye and I'm
also yeah I'm using the wrong shade you
cannot tell based on my lighting but
this is a pink tone concealer and I'm a
yellow tone gal so that's just not going
to be a pretty scene whatsoever if you
are going to you know go for a bolder
under I highlight just try to make sure
you're focusing it under your eye you
know not so much your entire cheek you
do want to make sure you spread it
enough you know you don't want to put it
directly in the corner because then it's
going to look just a little bit off but
you just want to make sure it's nice and
balanced you know for your face now for
contouring i'm going to take my Ruby
kisses 3d face career because it's a
couple shades darker than my skin and
I'm going to take this contour brush I'm
going to find the placement you know
where I'm going to apply my contour I'm
just going to start lightly I'm going to
create a line and I'm going to brush
that line upwards just so I don't end up
with a super harsh contour it's also
important to get a shade you know that
kind of coincides with your skin tone I
like to use warmer products because I am
you know a warmer toned girl I feel like
sometimes if I use a contour that's a
little bit too cool toned it ends up
turning gray on me and I really want to
avoid doing that also when blending out
my contour I'm just going to squish my
Beauty Blender for a more precise
application
see I'm also kind of smiling just a
little bit to help with you know a more
easier blend you don't want to smile too
much because then it may spread the
product a little bit too far in your
cheek but you know smiling helps just a
little bit you know because the cheek
air is a little bit softer and as you
can see my contour is nice and soft and
subtle and no sharp lines whatsoever
now for the don't side it's not so much
that the shade is too dark it's more so
the fact that I am bringing entirely far
too down it's really really unnatural
and you know trust me I've done this
before in the past I brought it far too
down it looks like it's almost
connecting to my mouth like a joker but
like Joker contour and as you can see as
I'm buffing it out it is spreading even
further and it's just pretty much making
I have a slab of freaking brown stuff in
my cheek and that's what you want to
avoid it's going far too down and it's
just way too low and it's way too spread
now for setting our highlighted area
since I'm more yellow tone I'm going to
take a banana powder and before I apply
any powder whatsoever I'm going to blend
away any creasing with my Beauty Blender
because if I apply the powder on top of
decreasing it's going to be crazy
obviously so I'm going to apply a kind
of thick layer of powder nothing too
thick but you know just enough to cover
that entire area and I'm going to sweep
it away I use this method lot I like to
sweep away the first layer you know just
to get it nice and even and I like to
apply a light layer of powder for baking
purposes and this is just going to help
highlight my under eye and she's gonna
look so much better if I you know apply
a second layer and not use that first
layer because that first layer may
settle into my skin for the don't side I
may use two powders the Laura Mercier
one isn't a problem however the problem
is the way I'm applying it you do not
want to go in sweeping motions
underneath your eye because it's going
to likely cause streaking you they want
to Pat it and then sweep away but you do
not want to just you know sweep away
first
a nap it's of another shade in this
shade is obviously too light and it's
more on the pink tone side so that's
just to double wrong
now for setting the rest of the face
everyone's powder preference is
different I use this powder because it
matches my skin tone but the main
emphasis that I want to you know make to
you guys is that you want to pack your
powder on first before sweeping it just
the same concept as the under-eye you
don't want to end up with any streaking
so I'm just going to Pat and then sweep
as you can see them I don't side I you
know left at the normal speed it's just
not going on as smoothly because my face
is sticky from my foundation as you can
see that's the gray that I was talking
about about this foundation earlier so
not one's a too dark it's gray and
that's not cute
okay now for contouring I'm taking a
nice fluffy angled brush which is
perfect for my cheek and I'm going to
take a nice contour shade that is not
too dark I'm going to dust off the
excess and start closer to my ear I feel
like when you start your contour you
know near the cheek you know kind of
where it ends you just end up picking up
too much product on the center of your
cheek as opposed to new your ear where
your contour would naturally kind of
derive from it that makes any sense
so you kind of just want to make sure
you know you kind of start in that
direction from I don't side I'm taking
these same brush I'm actually taking a
good prize you guys know NARS is popping
however I did not dust off the excess
and this noise contours a little bit
dark so this contour you can definitely
get away with it but it's all in the
application so you know when I apply it
lighter it definitely works out but I'm
applying it way too heavily I'm
spreading it too much and it just looks
very unnatural and just very extreme now
for blush I'm going to take a nice
fluffy kind of dome brush I'm going to
just kind of Pat it off before applying
it to my cheek and I'm going to allow it
to flow with my contour I feel like you
just get a nice kind of subtle blush by
doing this you know just making sure
everything is kind of one it just looks
nice and pretty now for the don't side
I'm not going to tab up that excess and
I'm smiling way too hard and the reason
why you don't a smile too hard is
because by the time that you you know
allow your cheek to settle the blush is
going to be too far down you see I'm
saying it's too far down when I smile
it looks high up and looks fine when I
don't
all it looks too far down and this side
just looks better do you agree I hope so
now let's move on to the last thing
which would be highlighting I am
definitely someone who over highlights I
need to just get it in control but if
you want to highlight you know like a
normal person you know you're going to
just pick the correct tone for your skin
I like to aim for more golden highlights
because it just goes my yellow skin tone
whereas you know if you're a little more
fair toned you want to go for something
like the hot I'm going to use next which
is starlight by anastasiya on the stasi
aprox our bomb the formulas bomb but
it's just simply not golden enough for
my skin tone so it ends up looking white
in a lot of lighting and then the final
step I'm just going to set my face this
step is important because it's going to
help you makeup last throughout the day
and here is the finished result as you
can see it's definitely a major
difference between both sides and I hope
that this video was awesome I try to
make sure that I wasn't too negative I
didn't offend anyone I'm just simply
trying to help you guys out and make
