you can see I'm wearing class today and
the reason why I'm wearing glasses is
because this makeup tutorial is for my
glasses wears out there because a lot of
you guys have been requesting of me to
do and make a tutorial that is suitable
for glasses you guys want to see a look
that you can wear and so slave with the
glasses on so I got y'all so without
further ado let's go ahead and jump into
the tutorial I hope you guys enjoy it if
you do give a thumbs up and let's just
jump into it shall we do the first thing
we do is go ahead and pry my skin and
for my skin type I'm kind of like
in-between
basically this part of my face is all
dry and this part is oily and that is
where my glasses will lay so for my nose
I'm going to take the benefit
Porefessional matte rescue and this
should keep my nose mattified throughout
the day let's go places on my forehead
as well anyway for the rest of my face
I'm gonna take my Laura Mercier
foundation of primer and this is
dehydrating one just because you know
it's about to be winter time and my skin
gets really dry so I want it to be nice
and hydrated now I go ahead and just let
these primers sink into my skin a bit
before moving into foundation just
letting it nice and when you call it
ready for it
great now for my foundation I'm taking
my honest osseous stick foundations and
these foundations are great because
they're actually formulated for oily
skin and that's why I applied my
hydrating primer because they're going
to balance each other out but it's also
going to be great for my nose because
it's not going to get all oily and come
up throughout the day and I know this
for a fact because I wear this
foundation a lot so I didn't want to
just throw on a foundation I've never
wore before like I want to wear one I
know hey cars outside I want to weigh
one that I know lasts all day
I'm going to take this morphe in for 39
and just buff this into my skin
and then taking whatever is remaining on
the brush I'm gonna go ahead and just
apply this to my nose for concealer I'm
gonna go ahead and go with my Tarte
shape tape concealer because it is my
favorite one
and it kind of dries down to a semi
matte finish even before I said it would
just I think why I'm obsessed with it
then I'll go ahead and quickly set this
with some Laura Mercier powder my
Lorimer powder
I'm gonna go ahead and just set my
forehead as well I'm also gonna set my
nose and then for the rest of my face
I'm gonna take my Sephora micro smooth
powder on this big more feet are zero
brush I like to mix it a little bit
lower mercy it how do I do this I'm
gonna go ahead and step away from the
face for a second and work on the eyes
and I'm starting my brows I'm gonna take
this beige cosmetics Studio Pro
waterproof brow pomade and you want to
make sure to use something that's
waterproof so your brows stay in place
all day I mean that's just kind of like
everyday thing but definitely be wearing
glasses so your glasses won't smudge
your brows
and then go ahead and of course set it
in place with my honest I'll see a clear
brow gel and I'm gonna go ahead and
clean it up using my NARS radiant creamy
concealer to prime I'm going to take a
thin layer of my anastacio waterproof
cream color in the shade honey gonna set
it with some loose powder for I shout
today I'm taking the jouer essential
matte and shimmer eyeshadow palette they
open it up and be taking the shades
desert sepia and dark chocolate for
today's look I'm going to start out with
desert first it's a light transition
shade and I'm going to take this morphe
in 518 and just blend it out into my
crease and I'm going to go ahead and
take the shade sepia
and place that right on top
next switching over to a zoeva 231 I'm
taking set via again and I'm just gonna
pack this onto my lid I'm going to take
the shade dark chocolate I'm just going
to blend this into my outer crease area
take that morphe brush just to soften
that shade out and I'm gonna go ahead
and create a quick wing a very simple
tiny wing using my Kat Von D trooper
liner
and then we go ahead and pop on some
mascara this is the Too Faced better
than sex mascara and it's the waterproof
one and then for lashes I'm taking these
lash that I got from the drugstore
they're called the S I don't know what
they're called but there are six 15 so
I'll have the link down below and I'm
taking these ins because the band on it
is very thick and comfortable so it's
not a mink lash band where it's a little
bit thicker it's very very thin so I can
just move them around they almost look
like my lashes but just more dramatic
and then diving back into my Joey
palette taking this morphe in one six
eight I'm going to take the shape which
is this matte vanilla go ahead and pop
this on my brow bone
and I'm also going to put this in my
flappy fold that may go ahead and take
this makeup geek pencil this is their
eyeliner pencil and this is nude places
in my waterline and then using a more
feed besetting tube brush I'm gonna take
the shape sepia and just place this on
the outer corner and if my bottom lash
mascara I'm going to take the only
mascara that truly satisfies my bottom
lashes and that's the it cosmetics
superhero mascara
now to finish off the rest of the face
I'm going take my NARS contour blush and
this is a morphe forms that go ahead and
contour peruse and then for my nose as
opposed to doing full-on nose contouring
I'm getting a little bit of powder dust
it off and then just sweep it on both
sides just to add light definition well
as a lot powder
for blush I'm taking makeup Eakes
puppy-love cuts very nice soft pink
blush and this is a Sephora number 55
brush and then in a previous video I
mentioned that lately I've been loving
using a white matte eyeshadow to
highlight and this is perfect for this
look because I still want to highlight
but I don't want to be shimmer so I'm
taking this Kyoto palette I'm taking the
white and this one because it's nice and
creamy and this is a morphe e49 i'm so
uses to highlight
to line my lips I'm taking this NYX
matte lip liner and this is the suede
one and it's in a shade subversive
socialite
and then for lipstick I'm taking this
full throttle lipstick which is also by
NYX and it's in the shade Nightcrawler
so that is it for this makeup tutorial I
hope you guys liked it and took a lot of
tips from it even if you aren't a
glasses wearer I'm sure you can still
take some tips because I think they're
pretty cool thumbs up if you did as well
