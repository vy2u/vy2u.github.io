today's video is going to be a tutorial
on this look and I also included the
hair this is x2 my second time filming
this look I decided to refilm it tonight
it's about to be twelve o'clock I'm so
tired and so hungry
we just want kind of little right now
because I was like uh but I try to do
all that camp for you guys and I knew
you guys want to see this ASAP so I
decided to just refilm it tonight and
include the hair because the first
tutorial did not include the hair
because the hair was just random I was a
ghost my hair can do this now so it was
really random sighs I tend go ahead and
just include the hair because you guys
are really really really really liking
on Instagram so you guys see it in the
tutorial where I show you guys have to
the hair look hope you guys like the
overall look in general
I really did enjoy creating it I have
created a brown smokey eye before I did
a little bit different this time and to
be completely honest my lighting
situation wasn't that great in that
video is really bright overexposed and
I'm just more confident now I have a
better setup so I just I don't mind
filming another video like this so you
guys don't mind either and help you guys
just enjoy the tutorial in general but I
don't want to talk too much I want you
guys to you know get into this tutorial
so I was talking now please subscribe if
you aren't already I love you guys and I
will see you guys soon okay so like
always the first thing we do is just go
ahead and prime my eye using my mac
studio finish concealer and then setting
it in place with some translucent powder
oh gosh my voice sounds so bad it's the
morning time forgive me and today's eye
look is actually super duper easy and I
only use one palette to achieve it I use
the morphe 35o M palette and I do have a
code for all things morphia will be
linked down below and I used a light
brown shade and a dark brown shade
and literally that's it and I just sat
there and I just blend in my life away
just making sure it's nice and soft in
the crease area bouncing back and forth
in between two brushes which will be
listed below and then I took the same
dark brown and placed it all over my lid
it's such a easy look like yeah you
could do it okay I believe in you
and then I took those same exact
eyeshadows on a smaller brush is a
pencil brush from zoeva and I placed it
in my waterline then I went ahead and
took some concealer on a flat brush just
to sharpen up my eyeshadow and I'm doing
this so that when I add the little wing
on the bottom it matches up perfectly
and it's nice and parallel and neat and
Bom
so I took an angled brush just to extend
the waterline basically that's what I'm
doing and then I softened up a bit and
then I popped a bone colored eyeshadow
right in the center just to give that
little area a pop now the eye show is
done I'm going to apply some mascara
this is benefits roller lash mascara and
I made sure to apply it heavily on the
bottom lashes just so that they don't
look blank because sometimes they do
look blank and then I popped on some
lashes these early lashes and style
Canas and then these are the eyes done
now I'm moving on to the face I'm going
to contour and I'm using the honest
hacia contour kit and light to medium
and I don't know what made me pick up
this kit haven't used in a very long
time but I was feeling it I'm quickly go
ahead and contour my nose all the
brushes I use will be listed down below
so do not panic okay and then I went
ahead and add some blush this is Taj
majal blush by NARS I just feel like the
nice orange sheen will look really nice
with the brown eyeshadow and then for
highlight I'm using Mac soft and gentle
for my lippy at first I was gonna do
strictly Brown I was like no Alyssa like
you can't just do all Brown so I took to
face Naughty by Nature which is the
brown shade and then to face Queen B
these are new liquid lipsticks and I mix
them together to create a nice mauve
shade and I think that I liked how it
looked with the brown eyes and now I'm
going to set my face and we're gonna
move into the hair which I'm really
excited about because you guys are
really liking it first you want to just
go ahead and add some moisture to your
hair you want to use water or some sort
of spritz and then I took my eco styler
olive oil gel and this brush I have had
for like a year and you're just going to
gel your hair down and completely
flatten it you're going to use a lot of
gel I know but you just want to flatten
it and make your part wherever you want
your part to be then I'm gonna take a
rat tail comb and I'm just going to go
in an S like pattern almost like a snake
just go like a snake in your hair and
see it creates this beautiful pattern
and you just want to do that around your
entire head it's extremely easy just
make sure you have a large yellow in
your hair and you just take your time to
make sure all those X's and snakes are
matching up and you just want to add
your file details and then your hair is
done so here is the finished look I
really hope you guys like how it turned
out
thumbs up for this hair though I was so
impressed by the fact I was able to get
some movement inks I really did not know
when I went to do my hair earlier this
morning why I did it then they keep me
do this at this length so thumbs up for
that thumbs up for team short hair does
everything let's cut the slo-moes
because my favorite part and I will see
you guys soon be sure to comment down
below what else you guys see
