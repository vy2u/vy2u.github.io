know I have been gone for almost like
five days now and people are like okay
like I'm waiting for a video like I'm
waiting but I have just been
experiencing some really crappy
headaches like just like really bad for
your headaches and I feel really kind of
like low like physically I'm emotionally
okay but physically I was like look the
hell is going on my bod so I have just
been kind of down a little bit but now
I'm starting a little bit better I'm
taking iron pills so I think they're
helping me so I am okay now so hope you
guys have missed me the guys missed you
now onto today's video I did a look
using the violent boss X laura-leigh
palette and the reason I'm so excited is
because honestly and fame I kind of just
was very happy because it was my first
time meeting her and I watch her videos
and she's awesome
it was my first time meeting her and she
was just so freaking loving she gave me
a hug like she was just so goddamn nice
and it was just so refreshing so
honestly originally I wasn't gonna spend
any money I was just there to kind of
walk around it'd be cool but after
meeting her I instantly went to the
booth again and bought that palette me
and my friend did because we were like
dude she's so freaking awesome so I have
to support anyone who's awesome like
that so it tested me let's just get the
tutorial I hope you guys like it
please be sure to subscribe to me and
subscribe to her even though you guys
probably already are because she's
amazing and I'll see you guys soon and
do some concealing I'm gonna take my
L'Oreal True Match concealer and shape a
little bit under my eye as long my
forehead just a place where I normally
place my consent I'm gonna go ahead and
blend that out with my Beauty Blender
I'm going to work on setting everything
in place I'm gonna take my morphe g35
brush and my Laura Mercier powder and
just set my under eye
i'ma go ahead say that same powder in my
morphe III brush just to set the rest of
my face I know I look crazy right now
but I promise you I will fix this I mean
nothing to fix this is kind of how it
normally looks but it won't like this
thing I promise
okay so this does occasionally happen
with my Laura Mercier ends up looking a
little bit too light on me I don't know
what causes it but sometimes it does
happen so to fix this I'm going to take
my Maybelline fit me powder and the
shade coconut number three five five and
I'm just going to kind of just buff it
over my skin and this kind of revives me
it doesn't make me look as crazy because
yes I was looking casket ready
I'm not hello you can't be ready you
didn't know any cast you ready
I placed under my eye as well just just
soften up that under-eye highlight okay
so as you can see that brought some
color back into my face so now we're
gonna step away from face and move into
the eyes and work on my brows first I'm
gonna take my honest hacia soft brown
dip brow pomade and my Sephora number
twenty two brush the angled liner brush
I'm gonna go ahead and fill in my brows
I'm gonna go ahead and clean up my brow
using my Inglot number 9s brush and my
mac studio finish concealer like always
and then to prime my eye I'm going to
take my Urban Decay primer potion in the
shade Eden I'm gonna go ahead and blue
it together with my sponge okay so I
went ahead and applied some under-eye
powder and the first shape I'll be
taking is mama bird and ragamuffin gonna
take a mixture both them and just place
it in my crease area and this is a
morphine that's really scratched out
whew zoooom you scratched out but some
more be blending brush
and on top of that I'm take the sheet
fry and on morphine 519 brush I'm just
gonna place that right on top
I'm asking to place on my lid
next time I take these shade whiskers
and we're taking that the morphe brush
this is M bo7 I'm pretty sure to be
right there
I'm gonna take whiskers and place it
closest to my little crease line and I
can bring this one up as much as the
other shade because I want more than
intensity to be right in the crease
next I'm going to take this morphe 408
brush and to szymek mix a medium liner
on it I'm gonna take these shades fleeky
and 1988 I'm gonna mix them together and
placed upon my lid but I'm not gonna
place it all over and I'm just gonna
place in that center part because I want
that to have some pop so please my
mixing me liner on it and then a mixture
of fleeky in 1988
now a lot pitohui and I was trying to
find my brown liner but I couldn't find
it so I decided to use a liquid lipstick
I use the melt it's too faced melted mat
and I'm just going to take it
it's nice Brown I can't think of the
name to save my life and I'm going to
create a wing with this paint brush
actually because I cannot find my brush
that I'll usually do it with so I can't
find anything today but I make it work
and then before I apply my lashes I go
ahead and just quickly do my under-eye
concealing it easy I'm going to take
ruggah muffin and then not that bright
earlier I probably did it my bright
mouse drag muffin wow I just realize
that I'm so pleased that in my already
my waterline I'm not got plates in the
waterline just underneath I'm gonna take
what is this whiskers and place that a
little bit closer up I'm not gonna smoke
it out at all I'm still plays they're
right near the waterline and then I felt
like I wanted a pop of color in here so
I'm gonna take these nice this make a
big full spectrum eyeliner this is mint
and I'm just going to place a couple
layers in the waterline but we got st.
layers is because yeah I do one layer
let it dry and that's layer just to add
some intensity
the last thing we do is go ahead and
take that same rpm 408 brush I'm going
to take basic and sugar mix together
just to pop it into my brow bone taking
about a nice little highlight I'm going
to take larlie and sugar and place that
right on that little inner corner and
then I went ahead and kind of darkened
my brows off-camera
it wasn't even intentional I just added
a powder and by default putting that
powder on the brow made a darker but I
list my use down below and now for my
contour my take my black radiance soft
focus finishing powder and this is milk
chocolate I'm gonna take my morphe e3
brush to contour
our blessed time will take maketh weeks
puppy love cuz it's just just my field
right now like I think it's my favorite
because it shocked me because I first if
it'll be light as hell looks like once I
put on my face is just get such a nice
one that wherever that is just makes me
happy so let's go puppy love and then I
almost forgot to contour my nose I'm
going to just take this morphe g 39
brush same powder and hope for the best
I'm not gonna do anything too crazy I'm
kind of just defining it and then put
highlight I'm going to take the violet
Voss pearl highlighting powders and it
comes with three-and-a-half filling the
number was a smooth gleam and starglo
would work for me let's see
and then for lips I am going to take my
Kylie matte liquid lipstick and this is
true Brown K first time trying it so
we're gonna see if I like it
now let's try the liquid lipstick it is
very liquidy so I'm hoping that it's
okay okay nice so here's the finished
look I want a hint upon this like minty
sweater to mess the mint
