today's video I'm quite excited because
I have been seeing a lot of people mix
their stuff and it could be like hair
products makeup this is the person who I
first saw do this and kind of bring this
to youtube and if I am miss speaking if
someone else has done it before I
apologize this who I saw I do it and I
love our channel so I decide that I want
to go ahead and have some fun and mix
some stuff just to kind of switch it a
bit and to see how it comes out
so we're gonna be mixing together my
foundations my concealers my primers my
bronzers my blush my liquid I like my
highlight it wasn't as raised I tried to
limit it to about 10 to 20 kind of in
that range so just throwing that out
there because that would you just been
like a lot so if you guys want to see
then just keep on watching I hope you
guys enjoy it and I already go ahead and
switch over to camera number 2 because I
want you guys to see all the mix in it
this is camera number 2 my hands are
ashy I'm not that she actually here's my
little jar I got this Moo target and I
have a couple of these so I'm gonna go
ahead and we're gonna mix our primers
first let's do it
as you guys can see I went ahead and put
down a crepe backdrop on the table so
you guys can see it because I'm
realizing that most of the primers oh
why didn't you can't see it but gets the
white so let's go ahead and resume but I
will just bottom the crap but it'd be I
was like aha
okay let's continue
my sicily tillage operator ah just put a
little drop of her that felt so painful
it one more primer my fingers are really
head cut a sheet that's crazy
look at my monitor like this okay they
gonna mix it up yes I am be heck of
bootleg and I'm using my last fuse but
I'll have my spatula okay so now the
primer is nice and mixed up let's smell
it because that's just what we do this
actually smells very pleasant
okay I'm weird let's go ahead and close
up and never go on to foundation because
I want to mix everything first and then
put it onto my face so that nothing just
sitting on my face as I mix because this
may take a while
this is a spray Suzuki a little weird
but we're gonna try it anyway
okay foundation mix is go ahead close it
up and do some concealers la girl Pro
concealer what was that mmm look at it
it's like water right now oh my goodness
let's I mean we got some concealer but
you got a lot of water
try for your how to get this out I think
I'm gonna scrape it on to the bottom you
like to scrapes
I didn't want to work out come on a lot
the last four are little pots so I'm
going to take the end of this and I'm
just scoop them out like so it's great
and keep scraping scream and scrape
mixes as best as I can now ready go I
have to face powders and I don't think I
own a lot of them I'm going to use
basically like all the ones that I own
because there's not many and I think
this should be easy that sure there's a
dump some bin so hopefully this goes a
little bit smoothly for me than the
concealer because that was the hardest
one so far
and lastly Patrick's powder hope this
ends up being really good and I could
use this now we're going to go ahead and
do liquid highlighters because a lot of
those this isn't a highlighter but it's
a face gloss and I feel like that's in
the same categories we're gonna add this
last because I thought I have more than
I guess I do so okay so now we have that
I'm not gonna mix it yet I actually kind
of want to wait to mix it with a brush
because I feel like that would be a
better scenario for me now we're gonna
mix my powder highlighters together and
this is yeah I probably have a lot of
these let's go ahead and just get
started because I feel like I'm have a
lot I know I am
occasionally 20 highlighters Athene fact
I'm gonna also mix this with a brush
because I think this is not gonna work
so let's go ahead and close it up and
actually I think I want to shake it up a
bit since the powder the blush I don't
have a lot of blush so this should be
pretty easy I have a lot of blush
palette so I'm gonna scrape from each
little thing in the palette and then I
know I said that the lustrous lasts but
I forgot was you saying spray don't have
a lot of them I'm gonna mix together the
ones I have I think I'm actually gonna
use this to put the setting spray in
because this is like empty so I'm glad
because I did not want to have to dump
anything cuz I don't be wasteful so
let's go ahead and just add in our last
thing sprayed some more feet go ahead
and dump it into here and then I know I
keep saying the last product last
product but I just feel like I'll be
cheating if I did not do bronzer because
I want to make it a full face experience
- eyes and the lips obviously so we're
gonna go ahead and mix up some bronzers
I don't have many of them but I have
enough to least mix at least five of
them just okay so everything is nice and
mixed and we are gonna go ahead and
start with the primer you're going to
grab it I asked so much stuff it's
driving me nuts that it's so cluttered
but it's just a lot of products
I'm gonna go ahead and rub it in it's
not sticky like my assistant primer it's
not sticky it just feels like it's like
a velvet finish okay I went ahead and
wash this brush I got washed if I wipes
it off I'm gonna go ahead and dig to the
foundation I mixed this pretty well but
I want to get everything a nice good mix
before I apply it just to make sure it's
getting a great chance this finish looks
beautiful you guys seeing that it's
awesome okay let's do it
that looks bomb look at the coverage
just look I just went over that come on
well it doesn't just look good like I'm
like in shambles
[Laughter]
That's not me the kid Wow Wow
okay not gonna lie I was a little bit
nervous and now I'm just like now I mix
in the concealer a little bit more we're
gonna go ahead and apply some concealer
hope it's enough let's see I will say
that I'm not like getting the same like
wow factor as I did the foundation
company foundation I was like whoa and
this is like okay let's just see how it
blends it hope for the best
okay we're Nelson me some teeth let me
see what she said
all righty let's see this four head
blend okay that's a terrible but it's
not giving me the wow factor like that
foundation lid so I'm not Helen Crist so
let's go ahead and set it before we get
Saul Creasy and stuff like that let's
see how lucky I set it and I'm a little
bit scared of the setting powder because
what if we look crazy well we're gonna
go ahead and sit that feels very soft
actually it feels like just like velvet
that's cool at first I thought since
there's so many powder it was gonna be
thick and heavy but it literally just
feels like you know like you know the
angel clouds and everything is just like
you know I mean hope that was you know
what I mean done that but you don't know
you do I know you do okay let's go ahead
jump off the remaining powder let me go
ahead and go into the bathroom where
it's pitch black and let's see look
flash in there it's I'm not having any
crazy flashback I thought I would so
that's good that means that all the
powers I'm using don't have like that
whatever ingredient costs a lot of
flashback okay let's go ahead
okay okay
warm it smells pretty good do we get oh
okay now for our blush go ahead and do
that well that's pretty oh I'm gonna use
this stuff oh that's pretty
I think what's next we have liquid
highlighters which I do not mix I'm
gonna go ahead and take the brush I
actually don't want to take that brush
take a smaller brush to mix it together
a nice mixed okay looks nice and mixed
I'm gonna take something on the back of
my hand but this much and then we're
gonna go ahead and take a sponge and
we're gonna apply it to our face let me
spread it out a little bit so it's not
too thick feels really good looks really
good
I'm excited
okay looking beautiful let's go ahead do
the other side a little bit on the
forehead for some glue thunder okay that
looks beautiful and I built that too I'm
literally gonna use these products and
you guys are gonna hate me everybody
listen I just use your record stuff
number like no I'm gonna use this tell
that mix evil it's 30 of them ah you
guys are you so mad at me but it looks
good and this looks great let's go ahead
and add our powder let's do it
I'm so dramatic look so good
then is that it okay I used everything
and the last thing we need to do is set
it all in place I'll go ahead and take
my little setting spray let's spray it
out to get it nice and sprayed that's at
our face okay so here is how we are
looking and I think it looks so good
this highlighter is what I need
and honestly I mean I think it just
looks really good so we're gonna wear
this let's see what I'm into this it is
234 and I'm glad just try to keep it on
for at least eight hours jamming open
its Albany Jasmine's come down to see it
do two things
oh no you need to be in Cameron that's
good right it looks like so legit on how
the foundation I was just like then the
highlights like a blinding see she's
telling you guys what I really look like
cuz I mean you guys probably haven't see
all the tints like on camera but we're
gonna see how it looks after eight hours
out so you guys need our it looks like
it looks legit okay so it is now ten
sixteen and I mean that's that's long
enough okay you know like I'm tired I'm
solar fusion earlier I was at the bath
so we're gonna take this off but here is
how we're looking and honestly speaking
I want to break down like my favorites
of everything I'm talking like you guys
are really gonna do this at home but you
know I'm thorough
I love the
like so much and I definitely plan on
using it again both the liquid one
especially the likkle one as well as the
high light one and of course a plane
flying by at the second I decide to fill
this I love the blush it's still on
really nicely a faded - Everly nice soft
pink I like the contour the contour is
okay and okay as you guys can see okay
they put some shadow right there so you
guys can see the oil above my nose and
all this right here I truly think that a
lot of that is because the concealer
because I blend my concealer kind of low
around my nose area and the concealer I
mean you can see right here it's kind of
creasing I hated the concealer combo I
did do not like it at all it's oily and
I feel like if I were to do the
foundation and then I were to you know
do my raccoon seal with everything else
I think that we'd be looking much better
right now we don't look terrible I think
it would look better because that
concealer was the oily mess so I
definitely plan on using these products
again you know my little jars just kind
of won't be wasteful and I think this is
really fun little video so you guys want
to see any other like fun video
experimenting anything or just anything
you guys want to see let me know and let
me know if you guys like this one for
other than that thank you guys so much
for watching and I'll see you guys soon
as in Friday bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
