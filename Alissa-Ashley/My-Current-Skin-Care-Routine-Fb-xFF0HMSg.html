put it down hey you guys welcome back to
my channel so by the title of this video
I'm sure you guys know what this is this
is my routine and what I do to my skin
and all my good stuff
I've been getting a lot of questions
about what I used and I feel so bad
because my routine is so simple so I'm
just like I hope it's not too boring but
I'm going to go through what I use that
can be too long ago video really
straight to the point so if you want to
see what I does then just keep on
watching
okay so the first thing I'm going to do
is go ahead and remove my lashes these
beautiful lashes finally lashes I'm
going to put them in the box because I
don't go in with my floor so I have a
lot of laughs on my floor and I'm gonna
take the Garnier skin active my cellular
not cellular micellar cleansing water
and yeah I was seeing a lot of who uses
products I was okay I wanted because I'm
a follower and I just it seemed it was a
good product because everyone was
reading about it and it definitely is so
I only use it what I have I make a phone
if I don't then I don't use it but since
I do I'm just going to use it on a
cotton pad just to get off all of my
makeup and it is best to use with a
cotton pad I try to use a tissue and
it's just it's yeah okay don't do it
okay it's a fail okay so now that most
of my eye makeup is off and the rest
will get off once I like rinse my face
I'm going to go ahead and take a breast
our makeup using my vanity planet
ultimate skin spa system now and it's
funny because I'm an excellent person
the question is do you really use this
because to keep it real a lot of people
promote this brush and they'll be like
and the brush would be cleans you're
just like girl are you even using this I
do use mine I've been using it for over
a year now and this is actually my
second one because my other one was so
old I needed a new one so I really do
like this system I like it better than
the Clarisonic Mia if you
I was gonna ask I do like it better than
amia and oh let me go over my cleanser
drop for cleanser I'm taking the Tarte
rainforest of the sea deep dive
cleansing gel and they actually sent
this to me I would have probably never
thought to even try it out but they send
it to me and I'm pretty convinced our
nails stole my purity soap so I decided
to go ahead and give it a try and I love
it she loved it too because she tried to
use I'm so I'm dude you already stole my
soul like what do you mean so I do love
it I love it a lot and gets rid of
everything it works better with a little
more wet but obviously in my room but
it's still getting all the makeup off
and then on my problem areas I put on
the second setting it was a little more
abrasive and I just go over a little bit
and I go ahead and rinse everything off
okay so the next step is optional or
actually I mean everything is off no but
this is my routine I like to take this
dead sea mud mask that I got from Amazon
and at first I was I went honestly I was
just moved to spend money that night I
was like I want a mask so I just looked
at masks and this one popped up because
of all of its good reviews and it's
gonna treat me very well so I'm gonna go
ahead and do a mask I do this maybe two
to three times a week not every single
day I like to take a brush and just
brush it on my face stolen with wet it's
okay
I would like to try some more masks so
if you have any suggestions leave your
opinions down below now that my mask is
kind of drying down I do like to teeth
whiten sometimes I do not recommend
doing every single day just like mask
it's one of those kind of once every
other day pad thing and that's what I've
been doing I've been using this kit by
small Sciences and I'm sure you guys
have heard of them before because a lot
of people have roasted them before and I
personally am enjoying it I know that
with teeth whitening you just never know
what to trust because there are a lot of
brands I make even real with you guys
and yeah I ignore a lot of emails but
when they reach out to me since the name
was familiar I did decide to try it out
for you guys and it did give me a coat
if you want to try it out as well what I
recommend is starting off very lightly
and just put a little bit of the gel in
the trays just to see how your mouth I
guess reacts to it because some people
have more sensitive teeth than others
but I can say that my teeth are
sensitive as hell and it gave me no
problems and I chose the bubble gum
flavor so it's not as unbearable because
I've tried teeth whitening before and
I'm just like this is so nasty so i'ma
go ahead and just pop these in and I'm
just gonna chill probably snapchat a
little bit and I'll be right back okay
so so now my teeth are done whitening
and then once it's done usually the mask
is done but I kind of put it on pretty
thick today but I'm too lazy to let it
dry so I'm gonna go ahead and watch it
I'll keep it real lazy as hell I'm gonna
wash it off and I'll be right back okay
so after I'm done drying my face while
I'm go ahead and take my serum again I
own take my stand when I'm not being
lazy basically I don't do things I'm not
being Lindsay and
the serum is amazing but sometimes I
just don't feel like so when I do I do
like to take this serum because it's
really good it's from h2o beauty and
it's the renewing youth serum it just
feels like all their products feel so
great
like I love angel beauty then I got a
vid on here in San Francisco and
honestly we never get anything out here
the Bay Area's okay I gotta go and they
just showed us the products and the new
stuff we have to feel it I was like I
can take that home right so I've been
using it ever since and I'm gonna follow
up with the h2o water bright
illuminating night cream and I just I
feel like I'm in love with it because of
the pump because I don't know if you can
see it that's right but you just pump up
the night cream and it's just so easy
and I get about one pump and I like the
fact that it's a pump because you can
see how much you actually need it's
close to wasting product and you drive
it in my face in the nacrobat I just
left a little bit of Vaseline on my lips
and and before I forget I do use the
Olay Henriksen cream during the daytime
this way use whenever I wake up in the
morning and this is like my base for my
makeup this stuff is amazing okay like
it is so bomb I'm almost out of it see
the little white thing in the back yeah
that's just a little layer left because
it's just so great I got like a couple
months ago when I was like oh when it's
been money I'm being skincare and it's
the only thing I did not return because
so great so try it out try it out but
other that that is my routine I hope you
guys liked the video I'm sorry that I'm
have any like secrets this is just what
I do
to maintain my skin and hope you guys
like it
again be sure to comment down below if
you have mass suggestions because I do
like trying out new masks
there's maximum fun I hope other that
thank you so much for watching and I'll
see you guys soon there's no slo-moes I

skin slo-moes still a full know okay bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
