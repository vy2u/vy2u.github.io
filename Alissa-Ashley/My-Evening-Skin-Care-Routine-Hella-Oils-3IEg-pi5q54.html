as you can see I'm at a different
setting today I don't know I decided
that if I'm doing a skincare routine why
not do it in the area in which I washed
my freaking face because it makes sense
so I am my bathroom and I'm trying go
ahead and walk you guys through my
current skincare routine so yeah we got
my skincare routine honestly isn't that
complex however I have been using a
bunch of new stuff I use live stuff but
like it's not complete does that make
sense you'll see the first thing I like
to do is wash my face now sometimes I do
use makeup wipes when I only use makeup
wipes what I have on my makeup and I
don't know my makeup I just kind of find
to be in a necessary step I mean I do
get my sink dirty why I don't use them
right now I'm honestly out of them so
they're not a part of this routine today
but the first thing we do is go ahead
and wash my face I've been using this
origins 0 oil cleanser it's a gel
cleanser here's what it looks like and I
love this cleanser at first not gonna
lie
the smell was quite overwhelming when I
wash my face I couldn't breathe I was
like what's going on so if you do happen
to purchase this do not freak out and
goes away up with the second use but I
was like what it is what's going on so
I'm gonna go ahead and use this to wash
my face as you can see it is well used
because I really like it it was sent to
me in PR but I have no obligation to use
it I just like using things open to me
specifically skincare I love skincare go
ahead in it all of my face wash away
this second later beauty coz there still
is one layer underneath that was not
coffee I was confident know the
difference mm-hmm now that I've had that
lathered on I'm gonna go ahead and go to
my sink and I am going twins us off
okay so now we are clean we'll go ahead
and just take this towel and a half and
pat myself dry make sure I got all the
makeup sometimes when I have to sink I
will go in with more cleanser after the
first wash just to make sure I get
everything don't get everything then
yeah it's okay for your skin and now to
hydrate and moisturize here is my
favorite oil at the moment I use a lot
of oils in my nighttime routine there's
my favorite thing to use it's not a
nighttime yet but this is I'm not going
anywhere so this is levity
this is the rosehip oil I got some
Amazon and if you happen to purchase
this oil I didn't know but this has a
little tint to it so I recommend putting
it in a cup so that way when it drips it
doesn't get on your counter because it
has like an orange tint to it and it
kind of gets everywhere so I'm go ahead
and take some drop it on my face and
just massage it it in the next oil I'm
going to take is this carrot seed oil
which I got from Amazon as well drop two
drops or three onto my face I'm gonna
massage that in as well and then the
last oil I'm going to take is this if
from caress it's called the wild rose
oil we'll go ahead and take some of that
as well I've got a lot of oil on my face
but it keeps me so hydrated and so like
youthful my skin feels so good when I
wake up it's just amazing I love oils
I've been obsessed I don't use actual
moisturizers anymore at nighttime I use
nothing but oils and then the last thing
I like to do for my little routine is
make sure my lips are nice and
moisturized and I'm trying to get it
open as I'm talking I like to use this
chapstick it is a strawberry-scented
chapstick it smells so good and keeps my
lips nice and hydrated I love you guys
wanna know my lip
routine I don't have routine I just make
sure that I hydrate my lips they cannot
not be hydrated if I lift her too
freaking big just go unhydrated does
that work I don't know if it is I don't
care for this you get the point they had
me hydrate at all time so this is what I
made with chap sticks I like it a lot it
smells good my lip tar was like oh did
you eat strawberries I'm just like no
and I'm like oh and that is it for my
skincare routine I told you guys it
wasn't that you know I'm not doing the
most that is what I've been doing lately
I yeah I don't think slowly as much as I
should right now my little spin brush
broke so I haven't been exfoliating and
if you guys have any recommendations for
a good like an exfoliating scrub be sure
to let me know but I've been really
satisfied with my routine because my
skin has not broken out it feels clean
whenever I do our makeup it looks really
nice and radiant as you guys can see so
yeah I like my routine I hope you guys
like it as well and that is about it for
this video I hope you guys like the
change in scenery it's much more
personal I got on my hero but that is it
for this video thank you guys so much
for watching and I will see you guys in
my next one
peace out did it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
