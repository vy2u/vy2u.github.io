today's video is one that you guys have
been asking for for a very long time I
slapped myself took so long and I'm sure
you guys pregnant oh she's a cat she's a
cat daddy she's gone she's not gonna do
any more but I am and I took so long
because I was actually planning
something and if you follow me on
snapchat you know that I am a
perfectionist I like to just put all my
effort to stuff and I always try to
think outside the box or thing is
something that I can bring like a new
element that people aren't really doing
maybe they are are bugs don't know and I
was okay I want to make sure that my
channel is something that you guys can
come to to really learn because I can
sit here and just like oh I like this
brush but you're gonna be okay what do I
use that brush for or what's the
difference between the morphe in 514 and
the morphe 27 Alyssa's so as opposed to
just talking about the brushes that I
like I decide to start a brush bootcamp
and brush bootcamp is something that I
thought up because I was okay I can tell
them about the brushes but they need to
know how to use them so I selected 15 of
my most crucial necessary morphe brushes
I have so many buy decide to narrow down
the best that I can so you're not out
there spinning on your coin and I am
going to teach you guys how to properly
use them to blend your eyeshadow and the
reason why there's 15 is because I am
doing a series of videos on different
eye looks because you don't use the same
eyeshadow brushes for smokey eyes that
you do cut creases do you if you are mmm
no each eye shall look requires a
different set of brushes so and some of
them make use the same brush and that's
why I chose 15 to make it easier but I
will be showing you guys how to achieve
different eye looks it's going to be
extremely in-depth I'm gonna yeah
prepare yourself and even when you get
the brushes get notebook too because I
want to be really personal I want you
guys to really learn and the reason why
I'm encouraging you guys
the brushes that I'm telling you about
today is because it's going to be very
it's going to mean you and you're gonna
be sitting there with your brushes I'm
say okay
pick up your more feet in five 14 brush
and do this so I want you guys to learn
with me I wish I could do classes in
person but I can't and I'm actually
quite nervous so we'll be doing like
video classes so it's gonna be really
really exciting and if this I want is a
success I would love to do a face one as
well and using proper face brushes and
all that stuff so I'm really really
excited about it so hope you guys are
too and yeah that was a long intro but I
just want to explain to you guys what's
gonna go down I will have all the
brushes listed down below I will have
the exact link so it's easier to find
for you and I also have my code that you
can use if you want to save some money
if not your baller they you have these
like over here but let's just talk about
the brushes that I'm going to be
recommending to you and then we're gonna
be using in brush bootcamp okay so I
have 15 here and I'm just going to let
you guys know which ones this video is
going to be super in-depth obviously
because I'm saving that for the brush
bootcamp which will start August 5th and
the reason why it's August fit is
because I'm trying to give you guys
enough time to purchase the brushes and
also it lands on a Friday and each one
of these videos for this series will
land on a Friday
I just think Friday's a good date okay
so the first brush that you will need is
a more fleet m43 one brush if you do not
own this brush just make sure that you
have a pencil brush because pencil
brushes I feel like are some of the most
important brushes especially for hooded
eyes because they're nice and tiny and
they definitely help a ton so either get
the morphe one or if you already own a
pencil brush and use that one and that's
fine the next one is going to be the
morphe m157 it's a dual ended brush it
kind of reminds me of concealer brush
which is why I'm using this one and if
you watched my math mixing medium liner
dupe video I mentioned that I like using
concealer brushes to apply my Mac makes
'i'm liner as well as my pigments so any
concealer brush will do but for the
series i'll be using the morphe m157
brush you'll also need the morphe 27
brush i love to use this brush to apply
my primer and honestly i feel like the
way that your primer goes on just sets
it in place for your entire eye shall
look so this brush seems to really
impress me out of all the brushes that i
own for applying primer because it
really gets nicely into the eye without
going too crazy and it just really gets
that primer nicely onto my lid in crease
area so any first like this will do I'm
not sure if you can see the texture on
the video but II 27 from morphe is what
I'll be using for this series you'll
also need a morphe M 506 brush as you
can see this brush is a little bit more
tiny and for hooded eyes typically are a
little bit small so we'll be using this
one a lot for detailing and really
really getting those colors nicely into
the crease area or any other brush you
may have like this will work it's
similar to the pencil brush in the sense
that it's more small but it's a little
bit more fluffy and they are used for
two different things so it's up to you
but again this is what I'll be using for
brush bootcamp so you want to follow
along know and do your thing you will
also need a morphe seventeen brush I'll
be using this to blend out cream
products and want to do my smokey eyes
demo you will see that the reason I'm
choosing this one is because it's nice
and rounded it's the same texture as the
one that I'll be using to prime my eye
but this one will work better because
this one will allow me to have more
control because it's smaller and I love
these brushes to blend out cream
products on the lid in crease area you
will also need one of my favorite
favorite favorite morphe brushes this is
the in 408 brush I have about six of
these I've been using them for over a
year they are perfect for blending out
eyeshadow on the under eye area so this
is definitely something that I recommend
and you don't know if you do not have it
don't know it something about doing this
you guys mmm
and then you'll also need the more feet
in three to six brush this is also a
brush of mine that I've had for years I
got a new one in LA so I'm very very
happy about that but this is perfect for
little small areas that you need to get
into especially they put it eyes so
definitely consider getting this one as
well because I'll be using that and
basically all the eye shell looks that
I'll be doing you will also need the m16
9 brush and as you can see it's a little
more domed and that is perfect for one
of the eye shell looks that we will be
completing together it's nice and small
if you notice the pattern I like to use
more small brushes as opposed to huge
and fluffy brushes because those just
end up making my eyeshadow look a
disaster so this is definitely one that
I like you will also need the Emma 330
and this is another cult favorite of
mine I have about five of these and this
is a perfect blending brush it is nice
and soft it is small enough to not
overwhelm my hooded eye but also big
enough to get the fluffy job done and
then you'll also need a more feet in
four for one brush another cold favorite
of mine and this one has a different
texture than the other one that I just
mentioned they're both blending brushes
but as you'll see in our series they are
used for totally different things
you'll also need a more feet in 412
brush and this one is similar to the
other dome brush that I showed you guys
but it's a little bit bigger so it's
going to be used a little bit
differently it's one of my favorite
crease brushes and then you will need a
more feet m22 to brush and this one is a
dome type brush as well but it's a
little bit smaller and you guys will see
that this one is going to be used
differently than the other one so
they're all going to be used differently
and I know it's kind of hard to keep up
with hints while I'm doing this video
because they all kind of look similar or
someone looks similar but they cannot
complete the same things and then we got
three more to go
you will need a morphine idean brush
this will be used to apply my brow bone
highlights and my flappy fold highlights
and just a bunch of stuff it will also
be used to carve out my crease
area it's just a perfect brush for a
little detail work like that and the
texture of it is what makes it perfect
and I'll explain that when I do the
video you will need a more feet in 514
brush and as you can see this one is a
blending brush but it's much more skinny
it's almost like a long pencil brush
it's a little bit more fluffy and this
will be used and about every single book
that I have planned so definitely make
sure you get your hands on this one and
then lastly the morphe 36 brush I also
like to use this to apply in my inner
corner highlight this one is totally
optional but I do like this one a lot
from an inner corner highlight because
it allows me to really pack that pigment
on to that inner corner as well as
underneath my eye in that little inner
corner so this one's optional if you
have something like it that's fine but
it's definitely one of my favorites so
that's why I'm recommending it and those
are all the brushes that you will need
and if you notice any similarities to
the ones I just showed to the ones that
you have at home that is perfectly fine
I am just showing you guys my favorites
because you guys were asking for my
favorites so I'm just doing what you
asked for and I'm just letting you guys
know the pressures I'll be using for the
brush bootcamp I will be using only
these brushes I will not use any other
brushes because I do not want to confuse
you guys or make you guys like ding it
oh my god that brush I'm actually gonna
mark these ones with red or a colored
tape to make sure that I'm only using
these brushes so yes do not worry about
throwing extra brushes these are the
ones that you will need or that I would
prefer you to be using so you can follow
along with me and yeah I'm really really
excited about it I hope you guys like
the idea and if you don't want to follow
along with boot camp you don't but these
brushes are still some of my favorites
so you can just go out and get them if
you want them and you just want to go do
your own thing ok you don't have to wash
boot camp but I'm really really excited
and I hope that you guys like the idea
and I hope that you guys are excited as
I come and you are be sure to let me
know your excitement and get me pumped
up be my cheerleader ok
there that thank you so much for
watching I cannot wait to start this
with you guys
and I'll see you guys soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
