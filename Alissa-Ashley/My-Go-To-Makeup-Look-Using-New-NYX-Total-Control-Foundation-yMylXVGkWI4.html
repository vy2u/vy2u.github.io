oh hey guys I'm back to my channel so
today's video is going to be just like a
little I'm trying on foundation until I
make up with you guys I guess you can
say I don't know what you call that but
I feel like I've been in my day even
though it's only been a week and that's
because I had a schedule to upload every
Monday and Friday and I miss Friday
because my skin was breaking out so bad
I had the worst allergic reaction to I
don't even know what under here was
swollen I don't know I don't know what I
still don't know what caused it but it's
finally gone I'm still a little bit sick
so you can find here in my voice but
work you know what screw the sickness
songs my skimmed okay I shouldn't even
work so if you guys want to see whatever
about to do to my face I don't know what
doesn't then just keep on watching
I probably something really simple like
my little simple everyday look but I'm
going to mainly be reviewing and they
makes total control foundation because I
supposed to do that a couple weeks ago
by do not get to do it cuz got sick but
this is their newest foundation and it
was amazing I've already tried it and I
post on Instagram is actually part of a
little campaign for the foundation so
that was pretty awesome me a part of and
the pictures came out really cute but I
was able to try it before you guys even
know about it and it's absolutely
wonderful and I also was able to try the
second time for another photo shoot so
yeah it's just been awesome
I can't we forget to see stuff but this
is the new total control foundation I
have the shades 16 and 15 caramel and
mahogany and I want to say I was a
different shade on the shoot and I think
it's because yeah the weather kind of
makes my skin change it's really really
weird but I'm either darker and lighter
sure a bunch will go to that but this
foundation retails $14 and it also comes
with a brush I do not have the brush but
it comes with a brush and that's $14 as
well it is already up on their site as
well as stores and all that good stuff
so you guys a little grab it which is
awesome because when I was originally
gonna film this video it was not out yet
delete you guys have to get it you guys
want it let's go ahead and just let's do
the makeup
okay so first time take my Melanie meals
saundra deluxe peach deluxe I'm taking
this as a primer because it's nice and
hydrating and it's glowy and I want kind
of a radiance to my skin today because
the weather's really back so I just want
it has radiance next I'm going to take
the foundations I'm gonna shake it a
little bit and there draw for
foundations so I'll show you guys in a
second time I mean by that and I like to
mix the two because I said my skin tone
is just like weird so I mix more light
than do dark but I kind of just
gradually add as much dark they need
because we're now my skin a little bit
lighter than it is dark that makes me so
so I'm tip drop a little bit on the back
of my hand just dab it onto my face a
little goes a long way and this
foundation is a buildable coverage
foundation I like a lot of coverage so
I'm going to add a lot but you can go
for a really nice natural look like they
dip in a photo shoot you can go for
Super Bowl coverage it really lot of
hands-on like your preference but I like
more coverage now I'm gonna add like
about two drops of the deeper shade
and then to blend this out I'm using
morphe 31 then you can see it just
blends into the skin it's really really
nice
it's a very velvet finish I wouldn't
call it dewy I wouldn't call it super
matte either it's really nice and
velvety okay so now we look good nothing
on to our concealer and I'm gonna use
today kind of feeling tart shape tape
kind of feeling NARS radiant creamy
we're gonna go for the doors today so
apply my NARS radiant creamy concealer
and this is the shade biscuit and yes
it's biscuit um someone comment saying
are you sure you get the name right
because like biscuit is a funny name yes
yes I've been using it for about at
least five years now five years that
trust me I know the name of my concealer
now go ahead and blend this in with my
Beauty Blender
and inside it in place I'm going to use
my Laura Mercier powder which
everything's nice link first and then
step I rest my face something like some
for micro some powder I got a new ones
nice and pretty little I use it so nice
whatever means anyway I'm going to take
this more PE 58 and I mix a little bit
Laura Mercier powder too

all over the place I'm going to take
this brow eyebrow pencil eyebrow pencil
brow brush to the angled brush and just
brush on my brows first and I got my
brows what does they thread it for the
first time and it was pretty cool like I
was like she make them look so neat and
it look way better than they did it
first so I like them and I'm gonna take
this equal brow and this is the shade
Rita and I love this equal brow done
should I fill my brows
i'ma go ahead and clean up my brows with
my tart shaped ape concealer and this
morphe r45 brush I like this brush
because really nice and tiny so I can
get really really in there now we'll go
ahead and apply these shape tape
concealer to the rest of my eye and this
is the r35 brush by more feet I'm doing
this just to kind of clean it up and
make it look nice and just flat and even
next I'll apply some mascara this is the
julep lint matters
