channel so today's video is going to be
my morning routine even though I filmed
this at 1:30 in our afternoon we're
going to act like it's morning because
it's a morning routine so I toss them
around a bit and then I wake up and then
obviously the first thing I have to do
like every social media obsessed person
is check my phone I have t-mobile's so
it loads kind of slow but once it gets
going I just show love to people I
follow and then I get on Twitter and
read all the fake deep tweets that are
tweeted and then I check my subscriber
count because I really try to get to
fight for JK go on BuzzFeed a little bit
see what articles they have and then I
hop up and I go to the bathroom because
by this time my bladder is like Lissa
you need to go or I'm gonna get on your
nerves because I have an overactive
bladder so this is something that I have
to deal with every day and then usually
a hop right back into bed because I mean
yeah I'm not starting ID yet and I
scroll I watched some TV and sometimes
actually hark me get out of bed because
my mattress is so comfortable he would
be mattress promo this mattress was
gifted to me by low mattress in exchange
for review when I moved into my new
place three months ago
and aside from the easy assembly in the
awesome free shipping this mattress has
made such a difference in my sleep I'm
not exaggerating all my old mattress I
was waking up so many times I'd be night
and look this one I sleep like a baby
even though I live alone so sometimes I
get off scared and matches are actually
a pretty big commitment you know it's
your sleep it's your back so it's pretty
cool because they offer a 100 night
trial and if you do not like their
mattress they will come pick it up for
you as well as give you a full refund so
definitely check them out I'll have a
little code down below and then after
all this fake sleeping I'm ready to go
to bathroom and wash my behind I've
drawn the water I like my water nice and
hot and then I hop in the shower and I
just scrub-a-dub-dub I like using Dove
soap sensitive
rinse this hair yes I'm bald but it's
still hair okay and I'm gonna freakin
shampoo it okay so don't don't say Oh
what are you watching to lose your scalp
I'm watching my hair and then I go ahead
and then I go ahead and wash my face
using my Vani Planet brush it was heck a
spin back my soap bad Meow's okay okay
so yeah go ahead and I exfoliate make
sure my face is nice and clean then I
rinse all that off and usually like if I
have makeup on my entire sink it's dirty
it's so fun and I make sure my face is
nice and moisturized I have a two-step
moisturizer that I'm currently using and
so far so good abused it for a couple
weeks it's the bomb I'll have that
information on for you guys and I go
ahead and brush my teeth you know make
sure my breath is nice and fresh and
then I spit it out
hello and then lastly I take my easel
bladder control because my bladder sucks
and this helps I take my iron pills
because my iron sucks too and then I
take my daily vitamins and these are the
women's gummy ones and then that is done
for the bathroom now it's moving to the
kitchen I go ahead and make my breakfast
and I love making bacon egg and cheese
bagels this egg get out the damn thing
damn let's go ahead and set this fire
and get cooking
go ahead and take my turkey bacon I've
convinced myself that turkey bacon is
probably better than regular bacon so
I'm trying to be helping here so I go
ahead and cook up that bacon look at
that look at that now go ahead and add
some oil I cracked my egg it was popping
at me and I do not like the yolk it's
gross to me but I make my little egg
take that out as well I drain some of
that oil and put my bagel into the pot I
like to use a thin bagels put my little
slice of cheese my bacon my egg and it
is ready to go then I go ahead and have
some orange juice I love the one with
the mango and this is my breakfast and
then add on to my breakfast go ahead and
take that and I move to my little office
space I hope my little blinds because I
love natural lighting and I just eat my
breakfast and I scroll and I watch stuff
and I do whatever I'm doing when I go
through you guys's comments and I read
the nice stuff and the mean stuff and I
banned those people my channel and then
go ahead and check the people on
subscribe to and see who up
this is Alisa here miss flawless use
clothes around millions to go ahead and
subscribe here she's awesome
then I go ahead and check my email and
everything in a nap time done with all
of my scrolling and computer checking I
go to where the magic happens
yes my feeling grew so that is it for my
morning routine usually after I've done
it doing all my stuff I come in here and
I film for you guys actually just got
done filming this if you liked it let me
know and I'll post it if not I would
just post something else
I don't know but obviously my routine
varies but that's the most consistent
routine that I have in terms of those
are things I do every morning sometimes
the thing that changes is my breakfast
sometimes I'll go to Panera Bread
Starbucks if I don't have time to cook
anything I'm too lazy honestly or
sometimes I wake up my I'm gonna film
this today so I go and get everything
necessary to film that it just kind of
all depends on the day but hope you guys
enjoy that and if you do like little
routine videos like that let me know and
now may become a nighttime video um yeah
I'll just film what you guys tell me to
film but other Matt hope you guys
enjoyed it if you did give a thumbs up
and I will see you guys in my next
