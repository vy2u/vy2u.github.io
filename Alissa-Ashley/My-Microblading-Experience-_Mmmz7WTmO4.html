so I need water
I'm out of water that's great so for
today's video I am going to tell you
guys all about my eyebrow micro bleeding
experience as you can tell
throughout this little video you tell us
quite excited about it and it definitely
did not end up how I thought it was
going to end up you know I'm about to
get my eyebrows Michael you did I know
that's not the best lighting I'm in this
elevator so I just want to let you guys
know what they happened hopefully she
allows me to vlog otherwise have you
been sad so I had an appointment to get
my eyebrows micro bladed and
unfortunately I cannot tell you guys the
price of it because this is like a
complimentary service because my
management team they set it up and I was
okay I want to get them done because the
person who did them they are known to
give people amazing brows and it is true
if you go to her page she gets people
amazing brows so I was just really
excited about the experience because I
was like okay cool cuz you guys know
that like my brows well if you don't
know now you know my brows have always
been like an insecurity of mine because
they're so thin and I can't grow them
right here they're just a lot of bottom
them's like okay I wish this was
different so I was very excited I've
always wanted to try micro bleeding but
I've always been very nervous but I
decided that I was going to get them
done so she's about to fill in my brows
so you can see the shape and everything
and then I'm gonna get numbed and then I
would have brows so excited I've always
wanted it but always been like scared
I'm scared so I go in to get them done
and everything's all good and we do the
numbing and we figure out the shape of
the brow the color everything's going
all good and ultimately she did my micro
bleeding and in terms of the pain of the
micro bleeding there were definitely
some strokes that hurt a lot actually
started tearing because I mean it's just
like a little scrape and you can hear to
scrape it's definitely something that
you to prepare for because I thought it
was gonna hurt at all but it ended up
staying a little bit so I do want to go
ahead and let you guys know that if you
do plan get as done it is a teensy bit
painful I know everyone
for in terms of pain but for me it was
painful feeling it and mind you I've had
like about ten piercings and ten tattoos
so to experience that kind of pain I was
okay this is a little bit different
it was bearable but it was definitely
different so we do the whole thing they
do look a little intense once you're
done so I was like a little taking it
back to come okay like I know but it
looked crazy for the next couple of days
but I know that once they heal
everything's look great so get them done
go home everything's fine I do what she
told me to do I put the triple
antibiotic on it and then I supposed to
put a ng ointment on it and everything's
that go out good I wake up and I look at
my face in the mirror and I'm just like
okay something looks different I was
like my eyes I don't know if this is
like normal for micro bleeding or maybe
I have some sort of reaction but I woke
up when I woke up all this a couple
hours ago they were fine now literally I
mean you guys are not hooded eyes but
not this hooded like all this right here
it's puffy I don't know what happened um
I'm making like an hour and see if it
goes away okay so it's actually been
about three hours and it is still
something my light keeps going off it's
still swollen even why do this you can
see like this whole area is I'm : and I
texted to see you know what's going on
and she said that it could have been an
allergic reaction to the numbing cream
that's just now catching up to my face
or it could be like neosporin so she
told me I just dab it off and just leave
it be so I'm hoping that it gets better
because look how crazy I can't do
anything like this I plan to film
something today but this looks kind of
crazy so I'll keep you guys updated like
they looked really kind of swollen and I
was okay I wasn't expecting that as a
reaction but I guess that may be a side
effect that may be like just a part of
the healing process
so I sent a bitch Darnell I took
pictures obviously and I was okay like
there
but swollen so I go throughout the day
and that day it wasn't that bad it was
swollen and I could tell it was any more
swollen as day went on but it wasn't too
terrible I thought that okay all i need
to do is put some ice on it
get some allergy medicine some benadryl
and it'll go away just an update it has
been maybe like five hours i've checked
in as you can see i am still very
swollen
yeah kind of sad because i mean it just
feels really heavy and just not that
comfortable i'm hoping it goes down by
tomorrow um yeah i mean i don't wants to
do I removed all the ointments and
everything off of them just to keep them
dry I just hope that they improve
because this kind of sucks so me or Nell
we end up going to lunch everything's
all fine I have my glasses on because I
was okay like I still look crazy and
everything is just kind of going and at
that point it was just swollen there was
no bumps or anything it was just swollen
so you don't know we have our lunch I
get back home and I go to bed and before
I go to bed it was still a little bit
swollen and it was starting to get bumpy
and I was getting nervous because I was
looking up little videos and stuff
online and you know like these really
really terrible stories about what has
happened to people for micro bleeding
whether they got a like infection or
just a bad reaction it just looks really
scary so I was terrified our nails
scared for me she was like oh my gosh I
hope this doesn't happen to you I'm like
me too okay
the eyebrow lady is that that thing's
the worst call the doctor she's
everything that's used as disposable and
sanitized but sometimes clients have
sensitivity to neosporin or a lidocaine
so hopefully that's the case for me I
just don't want to be one of those
things where like they scab up and it
just ruins my face cuz I'm just like
dude that would make it so I can't film
for like days and that would just suck
as a whole cuz I'm like I'm breaking out
I'm breaking out like even around here
I'm breaking out this is just terrible
this is just terrible I'm really like
thinking if this was even worth it
honestly this is like stuff so I go to
bed I wake up three hours later and
I do this to touch my eye and I'm like
why why can I not feel my eye and I
freaked the hell out oh just an update
it's done way worse I hardly have eyelid
now I actually had less of an eyelid and
this we brought with this ice on it so
um I know since she's in town she's
coming to pick me up with a friend so
that we can go to the emergency to see
if they can do something I'm kind of
like in disbelief that this is even
happening right now I don't know what's
going on but I'm just keeping you guys
updated I just can't believe this is
happening like I thought this vlog was
gonna have an entirely different
direction I did not anticipate it
becoming this at all so I go in the
bathroom and this is what my eyes look
like they were so swollen to the point
where I had to move like it was just
like it was so surreal because I'm so
used to feeling my eye and I couldn't
feel the shape of my eye because that's
how swollen they were so naturally I
panicked ice in the face Darnell I was
gonna I don't know what to do she said
okay let's go to the emergency so her
and her friend they left the bar thank
you for leaving the bar for me and they
can pick me up and they took me to
emergency this is at 1:00 in the morning
so we get there and they put me in a
little room and they see the reaction
and oh okay this is just a really bad
allergic reaction and at that point I
was a little bit relieved because I was
just fearful of it being in an infection
because you know I feel like an allergic
reaction obviously it goes away after a
couple days whereas an infection I mean
it could you can do some damage okay so
at that point I was just relieved that
they said it was allergic reaction so
they gave me some drink they gave me
some benadryl they prescribed me some
medication and they sent me on my way so
I took the medication I did all that in
the morning I woke up it was still very
swollen but it got better so I was just
monitoring it throughout the day I was
taking the medication I was taking my
benadryl I was just laying low I was
really frustrated because you know I
want to be able to fail
you know be productive but I couldn't
because my eyes were red and bumpy and
swollen but I was just happy that it
seemed to be improving so it's going
down and all the while you know the
brows they still looked kind of decent I
mean I thought that they're gonna last
and be okay but I feel like the allergic
reaction it pushed out the ink because
this is what my eyebrows look like now
and as you can see they basically look
the same from when I started like so
essentially all that trauma in trouble
was for nothing because it didn't really
last I mean it last a little bit up here
but on the ends where I really wanted to
be it did not it didn't hold up at all
and everything need water to hold up at
all I mean this is the picture when I
first got them done and I was really
hopeful that that was able to stay like
that and that that's the brow that I
would have but I guess that just wasn't
in my cards because this would look like
but honestly speaking I am very just
grateful that this didn't end up as bad
as it could have ended up and I'm just
go ahead and be grateful my little thin
brows and call a day and just I'll just
continue to fill them in with my pencils
and my paw mates because I will never
ever do that to myself again because I
honestly don't even know what it was
that caused me to have that allergic
reaction I want to say that it was the
numbing cream that could have caused it
because the numbing cream entered my
bloodstream because she puts the number
on and then she goes through the things
and then she puts it she rubs on again
so I feel like that kind of got into my
bloodstream and I had allergy reaction
to that so it could have been that it
could have been the ink she was very
sanitary so it wasn't her process in
terms of like you know she wasn't
dirtying like that like she's very
professional and if you aren't lerczak
to numbing i highly recommend her
because she's super duper kind and i
think she did a great job like when she
first did it I think my body just simply
was not having it and it rejected it I
was definitely expecting this video to
go totally different I thought that I
was going
have an amazing video vlog to share with
you guys about how amazing it went and
how I'm so happy with the results
however I can't do that because yeah
from about Wednesday to today has been
just like so not fun it has been
traumatizing like each night that I've
been waking up I've been waking up ever
like running to the bathroom to make
sure my eyes are okay because I'm so
like ah yeah that was my micro bleeding
experience I'm very sad I did not go
better but I'm glad that I'm at least
able to put out this video and just kind
of warn ahead that definitely do a patch
test or see if you're allergic to
anything that could be a part of the
process of procedure of micro bleeding
because it definitely is traumatic like
waking up with your eyes swollen like
that and not knowing what the heck is
going on and not knowing like what could
happen and then you go on google and you
see all these horror stories it's really
really not fun so I highly recommend
doing a patch test or just doing further
research instead of just saying okay
yeah I'm doing micro played again going
in and experiencing all that because it
definitely was not worth it and it was
just very very not fun so that is it
from my experience like I said I was
hoping it would have went better but it
didn't and it happens I'm just happy
that my eyes are okay because man I I
was scared I was really really scared
and my skin's getting better it's a
little bit breaking out still right here
but for the most part it's getting
better so I'm just happy that it's
getting better so I can just get back to
filming and act like that never happened
but I hope you guys found this little
vlog micro bleeding experience to be
helpful in any sort of way and I hope
this doesn't scare you but yeah that was
my experience I thought I'd share it so
there you have it other than that thank
you guys so much for watching this video
and I'll see you guys in my next video
which I promise to be much more positive
and not so scary with pictures of my
eyes swollen shut bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
