welcome back to Mission makeup Monday so
snails broken so embarrassing
so today's video we should make go on
day and I'm going to go ahead and do it
the old-school way because I feel like
I've been you know trying a bunch of
different little ways to do it but I
just feel like doing the old-school way
where I spent my colors first and then I
am left to join and on the old ways I've
spent for each color and as to decide
after go
yeah that's old-school way so I'm gonna
go ahead and do it that way because have
it been that way in a while and I know
you guys like it that way so that is
what we're going to do so let's really
engage thirties okay this side make me
dizzy how can i style gold first huh
that's me tricky is usually gold as
would be pawn their lid I mean I guess
my brow bone okay I wasn't expecting
goals to me first
but we have to use it and only place I
can think about putting goals in is my
brow bone for now because we don't even
know the transition shades or anything
so I'm gonna go ahead put in my brow
bone I guess this is the start of my
look and this is the D or the Dior Dior
skin new heirloom in either number three
and honestly if I can choose a
highlighter that I would splurge on and
I'll be totally okay with it it'll be
this one so beautiful
alrighty so now I'm gonna go ahead spin
for our next Tyler so first one that
makes in may be busy
give me something seriously yellow that
you yell the last one music okay there
is no yellow using the last one but I
kind of want to spin again because I
have a yellow looks I'm posting tomorrow
so I just don't know one with yellow
though because I don't we all this weird
it's literally a yellow look like hella
yellow so we're gonna be okay where's my
burgundy I know it's not Burgundy okay
so we got Burgundy
Oh duh have my milk back I have like all
the hide let me get my burgundy where's
that there it goes
burgundy I'm pronouncing it burgundy cuz
okay I just lost two things I'm shading
him we ought to employ my friends oh my
god wow oh my god we were about to go in
there blind
okay anyways I went to school with a guy
and he okay if you know the one who's
like hello fake deep and you know
they're always I feel a deep and all
eyes different and oh yeah I'm different
you know so we used always joke we
didn't he didn't know you just believed
I would don't say oh he's covers now
pronounce Burgundy like Burgundy cuz
wait no cuz oh I know I don't want to
watch this and know that I'm shading him
because what do you remember that this
is the stuff that he said now I'm not
gonna do it
no don't you
we're gonna take this is love sick from
melt wait this super yes oh I actually
want to take a MIG mug that's more
burgundy then this is the soap I'm gonna
stay down what is good alrighty and this
is a more feet inside 18
and then I think we're going to use the
other burgundy this one is kind of more
red but we need to use them in to blend
this out a little bit so I'm going to go
ahead and use that because it's weight
to the lighter burgundy so we need to
kind of use that to blend this a little
bit we don't look crazy okay so we got
that all burgundy burgundy pull our mate
oh my mom hello miss
somebody's fly offices oh wait oh I did
pick hey wha oh my god okay well I gotta
pick it all this would draw my god hmm
alrighty
my you pick color oh I'm just going to
say you pick so you pick means one of
you guys picks so I don't get to pick
back up on snapchat and just oh my god
Wow okay time to snap we're gonna snap
I'm so down hmm quick someone snapped me
a random color name alright I guess I'd
wait for what you guys think cuz I'm
still I mean I thought that admit I
could just take but really the I think
is over there they're landing on you
pick so I don't get to pick so we gotta
wait for someone almost being dirty and
get to wait for someone to like pick
color Oh blue okay photos blue a
pancreatitis it was the first one I got
all right so we're doing blue and I mean
soulmate because I was getting something
blue so oh my god we're like we're cool
right
so that's crazy Oh crazy but this is
kind of like a teal but I'm going to use
this teal to create what I'm trying to
great and I'm a pop it with the blue
you'll see you will see
that's what I feel bar just yet but I
mean we're doing it cool okay if I'm
sided with the gold right here because I
don't know I want to figure out a way to
tie in the goal so we have to skin for
earlier but it end up being
yeah as you can see when I open my eyes
it's not there but when I close it there
we kind of have this like peekaboo thing
going on right now that's how I feel
about it I do you want to complete the
look because I think that we can create
something cool with this going on I'm
going to go ahead and add a little wing
I think want to put the burden be under
here yeah I wanted to bring me over
there
I think or do I don't want to be blue I
think we look pretty and our blue I'm
going to go ahead and finish off the
rest of my face off-camera like my brows
and everything I'll be right back
and then from Litella I'm going to take
a Bondi Vampira all righty so here we
have the finished look I switched my
backdrop because I wanted to be very
sultry also went a little bit more bold
on the brows because I think the bold
look so I don't know it's just bold
okay so here we had to finish the look
and I wasn't speaking like many of the
missions you make a Monday look that I
do I was doubting it a lot and I okay
this is gonna come out really strange
you know I don't ever I've never used
blue and bourbon together ever it is not
really a combo that I go for you know
yeah I never do it but I think that
looks kind of cool I mean really cool
honestly and just a whole peekaboo liner
thing you have going on where if my eyes
like this you do not the liner but then
if I kind of tilt or I close my eyes you
see the liner I think that's that's so
cool no like pretty games are either
awesome so I definitely plan on making a
video on a more wearable look that has a
suitable liner going on because I just
don't know if that's cause like I was
never thought to do that so thank you

this look or this video be sure to give
it a thumbs up and yeah let me know
other kind of miss to make on Mondays

style you prefer because I do read all
the comics and I take it all into
consideration so yeah I hope you guys
