video is going to be a mystery makeup
tutorial you guys all look so it's not
so much of a mystery team or what's the
only way you can see look is if you
click on the tutorial because its own
nose blurred so that's the foot in it
and this idea was actually suggested to
me by a follower of mine and his name
right here and she left the comment I
was like but that's an awesome idea
so I damned her and we were just talking
I said okay well since UN's idea how
about you be the first one to suggest
well look you want to see for this so
she said she wants a bit pink with
glitter so I tried to do my best and I
think it'll be awesome and this can
become a series of sorts and every
single week I do mystery makeup Monday
and that'd be really really fun and I
think it'll also be fun to get you guys
involved and have you guys comment down
below what look you want to see next and
every single week I'll choose someone's
look and now you post your comment
you'll be right here next to me and
you'll just know that you picked does
look for this week so I'll be very
exciting so if you like how that sounds
let me know I'm just really excited for
it as you can tell I can stop teasing
but let's get to the video I hope you
guys like this idea and talk to you guys
later is the first thing we do is just
go ahead and clean up my brow
and this is a royal and langnickel flat
eyeliner brush I'm gonna take my Urban
Decay primer potion and Eden and like
always I've been loving this you guys I
really really have it's just amazed
I'm gonna blend into to get with my
dubious place brush go ahead and set
that in place
big bird shadow I'm gonna take is simply
Marlena by makeup geek and I'm taking
this morphe in four-for-one brush and
I'm just going to flip it all over like
literally all over it even my lid and
I'm taking the a BH modern written songs
palette I'm taking the shade love letter
which is a deeper pink and I place that
right on top I'm gonna switch over to my
zoeva 2 3 4 brush just to pack the color
onto my lid for my lid I'm going to take
my Mac mix and medium liner first and
just apply a thin coat and I'm taking
max rose pigment and I'm just gonna pack
that right on top
for less I'm taking food beauty in these
style Samantha at first
oops at first lieutenant love these
but I'm they're growing on me oh come on
Oh God Oh God there we don't go come on
well that's drawing and doing its thing
I'm going to take love letter from ABH
palette and just place that in my
waterline and kind of connect it to the
outer corner of my eye shadow up top so
I'm gonna take my Laura Lee palette I'm
gonna take larlie and I'm gonna mix it
with tickled pink and just pop that into
my little inner corner I love love love
lobby for this area it's so pretty
alrighty so for my contour my take my
black radiance pressed powder this in
the shade cafe I'm used in a while so
I'm using my Sephora angled I'm a not
angled it's not 50 product so you got to
know it's number 55 I actually like the
Sephora brushes like I do I have about
foot 3 or 4 them they're really nice I'm
going to Houston time a meet-and-greet
and people are excited I was like I'm so
happy and excited because I mean me
personally I'm not like I did
like I'm just like who want to meet me
but the friend of people do is just so
like amazing it's just me just thought
I'd hear that filthy deal like contour
my nose I'm just a lazy contoured but
you guys must be you want all the things
I do they are lazy when
let me know like lazy hack something
like that that mentality then her Bluffs
over take NARS orgasm first time using
this I'm coming excited I feel like it
has like gold little tint to it and sort
of my eye shadow so if I highlight I'm
taking my artist coat or gold digger
and let me just say I'm so happy because
it's my new one and I'm so happy that
they change the packaging because my
first one didn't have a little swifter
but this one does so it won't get
everywhere
very happy about that
how am I Cupid's bow a little bit and my
nose now what what cargos go with a pink
eyeshadow this isn't gonna be hard
hold on having no luck guys but I could
take the tart glossy lip paint and this
is double tap and hope for the best

infallible makeup extender so here is
the finished look I really love how this
came out like I'm so mad I can't oppose
