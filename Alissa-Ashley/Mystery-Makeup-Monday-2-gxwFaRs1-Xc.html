thank you so much for being here be sure

let's just jump into this mystery makeup
Monday
okay so first I'm gonna go ahead and
just concealed underneath my brow I know
my hair looks like super puffy right now
my camera died on me but I'll apply a
concealer to unnies my brow and I'm
gonna take my Urban Decay primer potion
and it's Eden and I'm just going to
apply that to my lid like always and I'm
gonna go ahead and just blend it out my
Judy's place brush I'm gonna go ahead
and quickly set that in place with my
Laura Mercier powder for my first shade
I'm going to take my Laura Lee palette
I'm taking the shade fry on a more feet
in for I think this is a 3/8 I'm pretty
sure that sounds familiar and I'm just
going to place this into my crease area
I'm taking pride because it's like a
yellowy sort of shadow with a bit of a
green
undertone so I thought it would be the
perfect transition shade for the green
so yeah kind of one with the flow and I
think that came out pretty well
then I'm taking dirty martini by mega
peak and I've got to take my zoeva two
to four brush and I was going to place
that all over my crease and I'm gonna
keep rotating between the dirty martini
and the fried is to make sure everything
is nice and a blended and then nothing
looks too uneven or crazier ink like
that and feel free to carry this onto
the lid as well because it's gonna act
as a base for our shimmery eyeshadow and
then I kind of wanted a more deeper
green so I took this vies art this is a
dark matte number four palette and I'm
gonna take the green in this palette
just to deepen everything up
now I'm going to take my Mac makes a
medium liner obviously and a morphia 19
punch and I'm going to take my lordly
palette I'm taking smashley which is a
nice green shade and I'm just going to
put that on my lid
and if relax I'm taking little ashes in
the stock on
that's work on the bottom half of my eye
I'm gonna take the NARS it's the I paint
is green okay that's all you could smell
this is green
I'm gonna take this Oh Ava 237 shader
brush and I'm just going to place that
underneath my waterline now I go out
with that shape from the Bizon palette
and just set it in place
now I'm going to my Laura Lee palette
I'm going to take more mixing medium
liner and just place it on the inner
corner I'm gonna take fleeky which is a
yellow shade and just place that array
in a corner case let's go ahead and
bronze I'm going to take my morphe e3
brush and my Black Radiance
was this pressed powder and this is in
the shade cafe so I'll go ahead and add
some color to my face and I'm going to
take my morphe in five-to-four brush
okay my favorite nose contour brush and
the same powder and just go ahead and
contour my nose
for blush them takes something nice and
soft I'm gonna take mega Peaks
infatuation pop it on it's not too pinky
which I don't want thing to pinky
especially with green I thought it looks
very Barbie like I like them a little
bit more natural
and I'm gonna take this lethal combo of
highlights I'm gonna take my laura
geller gilded honey and it some more
feet fan brush by pad for so long that I
don't really see the name on it but this
one looks like so if you know the name
be sure they'll be the plug and let
everyone know because iron one time
someone do the name like name or the
number so yeah so I'm taking Laura
Geller and I'm gonna take the Oprah
highlighter Beverly Hills and okay so
I'm gonna angle it I love you guys and
see you I'm taking this bronzing shade
and this highlight shade and I mix them
together I'm gonna pop it right there
and if from lips I just I don't know I'm
aiming towards Brown so I'm gonna take
Oprah this is in the shade Brooklyn I'm
gonna just place that on to see how I
feel about it
and then I want to mix in my Kylie lip
kit this is Dulce case just cries yeah I
love what it does to Browns okay so let
me go ahead and do my hair put my swag
on and get this all together I'll be
right back
okay so here is the finished look I am
Slade okay I feel like it's so
frustrating because my mystery makeup
