so I think it's pretty obvious what
direction I decided to take today's
mystery make a Monday it is fourth of
July happy fourth of July by the way so
I decided to do a fourth of July
inspired makeup look and I really like
how it turned out
I'm a really simple person so I decided
to do like a nice little blue glitter
wing and some red lips but I love how it
all came together so if you decide to
recreate it if you have some time be
sure to tag me on Instagram or Twitter
or you know bring it to me figure out a
way to get to me so I can see it and be
sure to comment down below what else you
would like to see and what you'll like
next mister make a Monday to be and yeah
that's it oh also I know a lot of people
have suggested that I show the look at
the end and I know it's kind of hard to
explain but I'll try to explain the best
way I can I'm trying to avoid what's
called skipping basically I feel like if
I were to wait to the end of the video
to reveal the look it will cause a lot
of people to skip to the end and that's
not really what I want so I'll grab it
you know okay this is what you're
getting this look you're getting and you
can decide if you want to continue to
watch to see how to achieve the look and
the mystery is in you not knowing what
the looks gonna be T click the video so
I think that's mystery enough for me so
if you guys understand it now but yeah
without further ado let's just get into
the tutorial first I'm gonna go ahead
and take makeup geeks latte and this is
a zoeva
two to four brush I'm just going to
place this all over my crease area as
well as on my lid
then I'm gonna take some Mirage which is
also by making pink and just place this
on my brow bone now I'm going to take
this so for eyeliner and it's called
fancy blue and it's like a liquid sort
of felt tippy liner and I'm just going
to draw wing
i'ma go ahead and take some mac makes a
medium miner I'm taking this paintbrush
it's an actual paintbrush it's from
Princeton Art in brush and it's an angle
spotter brush and it's really really
thin and has an angle so I feel like it
was just perfect and I'm just going to
take some mixing medium lineup first and
I'm gonna dip into my blue glitter this
is from NYX I'm just going to pack it on
and it's best to do this in sections you
don't want to put all the mix and medium
and then try to the glitter because I
may dry up
I'm gonna go ahead and apply some lashes
these are blue lashes and these style
tees and I cut them down quite a bit
because I only want them to be on the
outer corner and then for the bottom got
my eyes like actually think I wanna keep
it blank I haven't decided yet so News
go ahead and do the rest of my face
while I make up my mind I'm gonna take
my black irradiance pressed powder cafe
and this some more people rush by the
way
and I'm gonna take this make a pink
blush it's xoxo imma go ahead and add a
little bit of inner corner highlight
this is the same shape that I used my
brow bone which is Mirage by makeup geek
oh and this is a morphe b19 brush and
then i res it looked a little bit naked
so I took my morphe M 408 brush in the
same latte eyeshadow and just placed it
right on that little lashline waterline
whatever it's called right there for my
highlight I'm gonna take my boo because
it's all over glow and this is light
glow and my morphe import 3/8 brush and
just kind of go in with this I've been
loving this product so I would be
excited to use it
my lips are in shambles I can't figure
out freaking lip color I'm gonna take
this your ways don't love pronounce it
I'm powerless
then I don't like this red so I'm going
to top it with color grains trade Watson
