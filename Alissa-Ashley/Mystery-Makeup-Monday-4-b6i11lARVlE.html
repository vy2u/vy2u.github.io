mystery make up Monday
I know how to miss last Monday and
that's because I was in LA and he fought
on snapchat or Twitter you know that I
was out there for six days from
beautycon and I tried to film in my
hotel room but I was so exhausted and
the air up there sucks because my whole
throat was just tight it was just bad it
was really it was really bad so I just
couldn't get done I would never miss
another Monday again unless something
comes up obviously but I doubt it will I
hope so knock on wood
nothing come up but I'm back for this
Monday it was a struggle to frickin film
this because I just kept messing up and
I was like boring oh I've done this
already so I decided you know what just
go all out just do something different
so that's why it's all cool tone because
you gotta be used to see me do a lot of
warm tones stuff so I just want to step
out of my comfort zone so you guys like
how it turned out and yep that's all I
have to say really
trying to forget something but it's okay
if you do like my Michigan makeup
Monday's be sure to subscribe so you can
see the airing Monday and make sure to
comment down below what else you would
like to see from me other than that
let's just jump into this tutorial all
right when I had to prime my eyes I used
my Urban Decay primer potion Eden but I
didn't set it with powder I let it dry
down a bit and I'm gonna take this great
eyeshadow from makeup geek and I'm just
going to pack it on to the lid the
reason why I didn't set it is because I
feel like if I were to set it with
powder that it's not gonna make this
matte eyeshadow look as whatever the
word is you know what I'm saying like
it's not gonna really pick it up as much
and it may be just a little bit patchy
but because I didn't set it it's gonna
really just stick to the eyeshadow
primer
put some powder I need my are to catch
anything cuz I may have to catch some
stuff mm-hmm I'm just packing that on
and this is a so 8 by 2 3 1 burn and
then with the morphe in for for one
brush I'm just going to soften out the
edges and go ahead take a deeper gray
and just pack that right on top and I'm
gonna take a more two feet in 408 brush
and I'm just gonna take the same colors
and place them all underneath here I'm
gonna go ahead and create a winged liner
use my chat Von D tattoo liner
and then I took this Mickey pigment it's
light here I didn't want to spill it I
took some Mac makes a medium liner on
the back of my hand my Sephora angled
liner brush number 22 and I'm just going
to take a little bit of mixing medium
liner first I just start in the middle
I'm not gonna go on top of the wing I'm
going on top of the wing
oh God pop up pop up to explain I'm
doing and I'm just gonna place the basic
medium liner right there I'm gonna just
tap into the pigment blow it away so I
don't get too much and just pack it on
top of the mixing medium liner
and then it's okay if you get some on
the actual wing itself you'd have to go
back in with your wing liner and just
clean it up I need to go back in with
your wing liner
I meant lying there Jesus you guys I'm
not myself today you just clean up clean
up everybody everywhere as we just seen
a priest yc8 the cleanup song I'm like
I'm not cleaning I'm gonna go ahead
and apply some lashes these are Lena
lash and style Naomi and I'm using this
house flashes black lash glue and I used
it by the day and I'm just like why
haven't I been using black lash glue
sooner it's so much more easy so I'm
like OMG okay let me not talk about why
this cuz I mess it up
and then I decided to make the lash line
a rare we call it so what's that caused
something wrong oh my god oh no but this
little area I decided to smoke it out
and I'm going to use the hourglass
mechanical gel eyeliner in ocean floor
and I want to do blue is it a black just
switch it up and I thought it went
really beautifully with this whole
entire eye look I just I felt it in my
heart and my soul okay we put it on okay
I'm going to take my morphe in 408 brush
and just kind of softening and diffuse
it and I good stuff let me go ahead and
just warm up my complexion why say like
that I'm going to take the Black
Radiance
true combo true complexion contour
palette and light to medium and I take
both of the shades the contouring sculpt
shades and just do my fizzle I love this
eye look it's so pretty
what Lepus I go with this though that's
some real question
oh how rude and PI this is a four-eyed
nerd 55 brush my bad almost didn't tell
you guys
and then for blush I'm gonna take Tosh
maja I feel like orange II blushes pair
very well with cool tone eyes that's
just my personal opinion I'm just gonna
go ahead and lightly apply that to my
face and then for highlight I'm taking
my Ruby kisses all of our globe bronzing
powder and light to glow and this is a
morphe b8 fan brush that got a new fan
brush for you guys because i know my old
one i couldn't figure out the freaking
number for it
so is okay what am i using it and this
one's just beautiful so now you know new
fan brush in the building okay
and okay I know that I use a lot of
freaking mommy cool tone pink tone all
that color of lip colors but I feel like
it's the most suiting for this look so I
mean hmm hmm how's it going Sofia it's
too hard of stone let's do some freaking
great
a little bit black lipstick just a ton
of down a bit we're creating right now
you guys this is what real artistry
wherever looks like that's in black I'm
trying to like spice it up but not be so
boring all the time then we were not
stopping there I'm gonna try my best to
create a metallic lippy I'm taking this
royal and langnickel large concealer
brush and this is dose of colors shell
I'm just gonna like just please down my
lips and I'm going to take that man
pigment that I used as my wing and just
dip my little finger into it and we're
just gonna like to see what happens here
and then it wasn't giving me life the
way I want my life to be given so I took
this try got the pan I took this
coloured raine flashing lights silver
ocean
silver eye shadow I was gonna pack it on
top why I did but like we're gonna do
some work with a camera well Alyssa so
here is the finished look in honey I am
here for this I am like I love this like
I have to go out and puppet now I don't
care if I get stares
I don't care about that because I feel
like this looks so freaking cool um

this for some sort of like space look
