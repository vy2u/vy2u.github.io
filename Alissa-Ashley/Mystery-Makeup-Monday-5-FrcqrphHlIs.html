gonna go for I know what to do something
with yellow because I got a couple of
comments last week saying something with
yellow and a little bit orange so that's
why I tried to do but okay popping right

mystery because I want this to be a real
Satori who hold like they can shell out

onto the video so if you have any
suggestions for my next mystery make up
Monday let me know in the comment
section below because I usually go off
of what people are saying in the comment
section and that's how I come with the
look or sometimes I just sit here and
just let my creative uses like I did
today
so yeah you want to see how I got this
look then just keep on watching okay so
as you can see our I have one eye pretty
much done I'm not gonna zoom in because
this is such a basic look and I requires
me to switch out lenses and all that
stuff so I'm gonna take this morphe m51
8 brush and he kept on d me vida loca
palette and I'm gonna take the shade
friends it's just a yellow eyeshadow and
place this everywhere
I'm also gonna use my finger just to
pack this onto my lid next i'm taking
this mac mixing medium eyeliner i'm
gonna go ahead and lay down my lid and
I'm gonna take this coloured raine
superstar eyeshadow and just place that
right on top and this is a Ruby kisses
concealer brush next I'm going to take
this NYX jumbo pencil into the shade
cashmere but any kind of golden
champagne crayon will do I'm gonna use
as a base I need my eye
now I'm gonna pack down that yellow
eyeshadow from the Kat Von D me betta
loca and just place that right on top
and I'm also gonna go over it with the
superstar my shot and color ring
when this some work the import or eight
brush also placing this on my flabby
fold next I'm gonna go ahead and just
pop on some mascara and then I want a
little more definition so I may take
this zoeva two three four
Lexi smokey shader brush I'm going to
take an orange eyeshadow this is awesome
the kat von d palette and place that
directly into the crease area and I'm
there layer the yellow one right on top
and I'm going to bring it up even higher
because I feel like I want to be a
little more defined so I don't look too
crazy so I'm just keep going back and
forth with the orange and the yellow and
two I'm satisfied and this is a zoeva
two to eight and AM or PM one in five
one three
let's go ahead and quickly add some
color to the face I'm going to take the
Too Faced milk chocolate Soleil bronzer
just to see okay he's gonna show up on
me hmm
barely I was trying to freaking switch
it up and not do the dark chocolate
because I want something a little more
subtle when I guess if i mix them a
little bit it'll work out for me
and then for blush I felt like my makeup
geek summer fling was perfect for this
because it's nice and PG and then for
highlight first I'm going to take my
ribbon kisses all over glow bronzing
powder and this is a morphine ether t-3
brush and I'm going to take a little bit
of Anastasi as peach nectar
I decided to go ahead and add some wing
line and let's bug the eyes looks little
to make it for my taste
I'm gonna take the cap on the trooper
liner and just draw my wing I'm gonna go
ahead and pop off some lashes these are
Lily lashes and style Miami and then for
lip color I knew I wanted something
bright I just I want to be bright so but
I couldn't find the perfect color I'm
gonna do this little shade right here by
mixed two shades I'm gonna take a color
drains speechless first very pretty
color by the way on its own
I kinda like this might someone actually
I really like this this is so pretty and
it was not intentional with his backdrop
I did not glad to on blue lip okay and
then to add more of a little blue
element since now we're doing blue lips
I'm gonna take it the Anastacio
moonlight kit and we take blue moon and
we'll go ahead and just glance my cheek
here is the finished look I am gonna
keep my hair like this like the little
curls I feel like my curls are probably
coming back after bleaching for so many
times but I haven't bleached in a while
so they're coming back so I want to keep
them so this is the finished look and
I've been really really trying to step
out of my comfort zone y'all

out if you do be sure to give a thumbs
up and let me know what you want to see
