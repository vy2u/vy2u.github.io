today's mystery makeup Monday is going
to be a little bit different and it's
going to be a real mystery it's even a
mystery for me I already have my
foundation stuff on and I'll explain
that later let's to be real mystery date
because I decided to create okay
I bought this freaking expensive ass
little wheel thingy on Amazon and I
decided to cut out like a bunch of
different little terms like make up
terms and like colors it's like that and
basically what I'm going to do is for
each step of my makeup I'm gonna stick
on some of the levels terms and a
business and it's got to tell me what to
do and I have to do it and it may be a
disaster it may come a beautiful we're
going to find out together her if you
want to see how it's gonna turn out then
just keep on watching
okay so I'm still with Vince with you
guys i sat there and cut them all out I
printed them I put little velcro's make
either be I'm too cool for the first
thing we have to do are be brows and for
the brows I still want to do the same
little challenge where I chose a brow
bones okay how do I write that down so I
found this little thing online I'm sure
if you look up brow shapes it kind of
pops up automatically and they have all
these little brow shape so this is
glamorous natural this is dramatic
natural seductive natural so I much just
printed that out and I'm gonna put them
on here where the other ones the crown
like everywhere I had a bunch of
deadlocks this one is the one I'm scared
of it's exotic natural so I'm gonna spin
this thing and whatever lands on I have
to try to create that Brown shape to the
best of my ability so let's just try
this one down
nice here okay please please please
ah dramatic natural so you see this
shape right here I have to try that so
let's do it - to make this easier for
myself I'm going to do my little eyebrow
trick where I outline with concealer
first and then fill it in obviously I'm
not going to get it that thin because my
brow isn't that thin but I'm gonna get
the same tree I'm gonna try so we're
gonna try this out I'm going to take my
mix tape and frame and this is in the
shade chocolate on my Sephora number 22
angled brush and we're just gonna get to
work here okay look at you again
okay straight around okay
okay now let's go ahead into the other
one I'll be right back
so now let's move on to our eye shadow
type and what we're gonna do before we
move to the colors of the eye shadow I
want to choose a look and I really try
to break it down so it's like more fun
so we have halo eye as an option which
I've never done before so I'm really
scared by that a metallic eye a basic I
shall look we're just basically what I
do every single week and you guys tell
me to do something different a dramatic
eye
I'll cut C which is a cut crease but I
couldn't freaking fit it and a smoky
eyes let's go ahead and just what I'm
doing basic okay like I can spin again
on this cuz I don't want to bore you
guys just make more fun cut crease okay
rich boy dad that sounds more fun but I
don't like a basic you know like you
know those to me not to so I got a
second spin on that one let's do cut
crease you guys okay so I went ahead and
put my colors on my little board I have
pink yellow orange blue purple and green
I didn't do red because I don't really
own red eyeshadow so how's that gonna
work so I didn't do it oh and okay I
guess Sam that's only explanation I have
I didn't know else let's go with that
let's let's pitch God look I want to cry
okay so I have my Kat Von D V vida loca
palette I'm taking the shade misfit and
it's a nice little green shape where's
my mirror I'm gonna take my Sephora Pro
angled brush the same one I used my
brows MacCready crease
I'm not going to think well like I did
in my cut crease hooded eyes video I'm
just like go along my natural crease
line and I'm gonna take my still aim at
230 brush and more of that green and
just bring it upwards into the crease
area
okay so now leave to choose the color
that I put on my lid I went ahead and
just shifted the shades on my little
wheel just to kind of switch it up and I
feel like that like decrease the
probability of me getting green again
because I don't want to get green on do
something fun let's go ahead and just oh
I'm so close to creepy
see I tried to fix it but so close the
goddamned green I think it says how I'm
spinning it okay so we got purples I
guess we're going for a halt look today
I'm a little finds a purple okay so I
got my purple it's in my super Beauty
palette and I feel dumb because I didn't
realize there's a red eyeshadow in here
so technically I couldn't say red but
now that I know that have a red
eyeshadow red look coming soon I'm gonna
take this nameless brush and I'm just
going to add a little bit of concealer
to my lid just to clean it up a little
bit make more neat and I'm gonna start
packing on this purple
and now that's on and you look crazy we
have to choose a shame to go under here
go ahead and just it's like stuck okay
we have it over look it's like stuck
right there
edible count that's not count okay yes
we do it orange for my orange shadow I'm
taking beta Peaks Morocco and then I
fight the purple could use a little bit
more shimmer there's a little more shine
so I'm going to take this make a peak I
shadow what is it
masquerade and I'm gonna place it right
on top and now the purple is so dominant
I feel it you'll be smart to carry the
green up a little bit more so it doesn't
get lost four lashes I'm slipped along
these little latches in style con X is
just sitting here and I didn't make a
little spinny for the lashes so I'm just
a pop them on now go ahead and just
bronze up my skin and this one really
didn't require a spinny thingy but I
need to actually definition for this
look to come together
and then for blush I have a purple blush
a orange flash in a pink blush so I want
to make it fun you choose that as well
so not a blink Atlanta like peak okay
where do pink and this is mega Deeks
Valentine actually never used before it
looks really pretty and I can't buy my
other one so let's do it
it is the morphe 53 brush I'm going to
just pop on any highlighter that I have
this is Laura Geller ballerina and now
we in choose lip color so I'm really
hoping that it's something that's like
decent because this right here just pink
lips and of course we have choose the
finish so am I gonna have to make a
metallic pink lip a regular matte liquid
lipstick or gloss okay cool oh so scare
in the metallic okay so I try to put
lipstick on and my lips are so freakin
dry so but I'm gonna take color Raines
sorbet so here's the finished look and
uh it's not the most wearable look ever
but it was fun I think is very fun to
just kind of go with the flow well not
really go to flow go with the wheel and
just create this look so I hope you guys
like this video it was really a mystery
indeed so if you guys want to see more
like this not every single week because
I own it could freakin risk my freaking
makeup look on a wheel every single week
oh you want to see this every once in a
while let me know and if you have any
suggestions if you do want
see and you want to improve it let me
know what I can do better
other than that thank you so much for
watching and I guess we can get some
snowballs at this look you know it's
interesting if it was this little steel
so I'll see you guys soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
