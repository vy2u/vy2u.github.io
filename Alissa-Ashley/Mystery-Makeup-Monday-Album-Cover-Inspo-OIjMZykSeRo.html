for today's mystery make up Monday I
won't the one I have lately been staying
up until like 2:00 and 3:00 in the
morning don't know why I'm glad tired
right now anyways I listen to music last
night and it inspired today's video
because I love music and I think that I
don't know I want to just talk to you
guys more about like nah make up stuff
and I just want to talk to you about my
music choices so you guys can get to
know me better
so basically what I'm gonna do is I am
going to spin and whichever album cover
it lands on I am gonna do a look
inspired by it and we are just gonna
talk about music I'm gonna talk to you
guys about why each and every single one
of these album covers is even on this
board and why so if you guys want to see
that then just keep on watching and I
hope you guys enjoy it ok so as you can
see I have my base on foundation powder
concealer no brows because I don't know
where these brows may end up being or
looking like but as you can see I don't
have my my far out lens today so kind of
can't see all of them at once
as you can see I have 14 at different
albums on here and in terms of how I
went about selecting the album's none of
them are new I didn't want to new school
I wanted to do albums that I personally
grew up listening to just my childhood
whether it be my mom will play around
the house or just albums that I listened
to in high school so that's just this
era that's the era we're focusing on
today so I have a bunch of them on here
I want to talk about some of them if you
guys don't mind
we have Ledisi lost-and-found and that
is one that my mom used to play every
single weekend because I know what kind
of household you grew up in but the
weekends were cleaning weekends so I'd
be sleep in my bed and then I'll just
hear lettuce lettuce e we have black
street man the album was just aa mary j
blige grizzly bear victim is Kid Cudi we
got awesome Kid Cudi honestly if it were
up to me I would have
all of his albums on here but I didn't
want to not be fair or I carry the
immense patient I can never pronounce
that word of me me Amy Winehouse Frank
classic Stevie Wonder Earth Wind and
Fire
this is u2 and this is a single that I
am referencing so we'll talk about that
later we have Lauren Hill we have some
karl-thomas we have some Kanye West late
registration so those are my choices for
today so now because I am talking so
much and I plan talking a lot this video
let's go ahead and spin to see what
album will be pulling inspiration from
for this makeup look I'm so excited it's
nice because the colors on this album
are amazing okay so we got some goddamn
cake cutting we got some kid cudi let's
put this in the back of us let me scoot
up and let's do a look okay so let me
get my eye base ready so we can get to
this look Oh what am I gonna do dang
what am I gonna do okay okay so well
since we landed on cake huh D let's talk
about what cake Cuddy's music means to
me personally my favorite song on this
entire album my favorite song is my
world and men like I think that's just
like one of my top ten songs to listen
to of all time and I feel like it's
because depending on what mood I'm in or
basically I could be in any mood but
that song is always gonna just put me in
a certain vibe it's just gonna put me in
this vibe that gives me this overall
confidence that I could do anything and
I like music like that and I like Kate
Cuddy's music like that because I just
feel like it just gives you such a just
such a good vibe like he's just a whole
vibe on his own and then of course
there's other classes as well the song
day and night is on there and I remember
the first time I heard that song this
was back in the myspace era ah
this was the myspace time and I
went I went to school this girl and she
had a sister at the time I didn't know
they were sisters I can't remember her
name cuz I'm really bad memory but I
went to her profile you know how
whenever used to go on someone's profile
songs to play
I was Instagram I do that so that we can
just kind of get a feel for people but
she had that song playing and I was like
I was like oh god this is all good so I
wouldn't put on my profile - I used to
just copy people songs I'm like oh I
like it
I'm like I want on my profile so I went
and I put it on my profile - and that's
my first time ever hearing Kid Cudi okay
so as I do my eye shadow
let's go ahead and talk about some of
the other albums that I have here on my
wheel let's circle back to Ledisi man
honestly speaking sometimes I could sit
there and listen to Letta C and I'll
damn near be in tears honestly with a
lot of those albums and songs I'll be in
tears and to be very honest with you
it's not even so much the song itself
that is bringing me to tears it's the
memories connected to the songs that
make me very emotional because man and
I'm just gonna say this I'm gonna say
before I get to my makeup because I
don't know I'm so emotional so I'll get
watery eyes sometimes I probably well
right now because I've already mentally
prepare myself last night but it's like
man if you are like younger or even like
if you're my age but mainly if you're
like what from the ages of like 12 to 15
high school like middle school and you
you know obviously still live like in
your parents household I just like
cherish the things that your parent does
and of course not all of our parents are
like perfect
I don't know anyone's like background
personally like if you do like have like
issues with your parent I'm sorry and I
you know hope that this is not like
bringing any bad memories but for me
personally my mom you know like she used
to you know wake up and clean and it's
like in those moments your thing okay oh
my god you know like why she always want
to clean like why she always cleaning
but then it's like as you get older and
it's like you see
your parent they're getting older too
and it's like you're not realizing
because you're worried about your own
little growth it's like they're getting
older and it's like she's not able to
like do all that like she used to so
it's like it's almost I don't know it's
just such a like a surreal feeling
seeing your parents age and realizing
okay like wow like they're getting older
in you they're not able to be as active
as it used to be for example and it's
like I don't know to me I feel like now
as an adult I cherish and value and
appreciate the energy my mom had you
know just being around and like raising
us and just like her overall spirit as a
person because it's like now I'm able to
listen to all these songs and all these
albums and I just I get so overwhelmed
with so much joy sometimes I do cry
because I'm just like man like that's so
cool you know like it just it makes it
makes your heart feel warm because it's
like you just connect those songs to
your parent and you're just like wow
like yeah pretty cool mom so sometimes
as an adult I just I wish I can go back
and you know appreciate that more and
like I wish that like when I heard the
music I didn't get annoying oh we're
cleaning today I wish I was just kind of
like just more excited to be in the
moment in the presence of my mom's like
beautiful spirit she's still alive but
like it's just you know it's different
you know it's her in different times now
so what I just do
so I mean luckily like as an adult I
definitely am able to show my mom I
appreciate her in different ways but I
don't know sometimes I just wish I can
go back in time and just appreciate more
because it's like I mean we're not
getting any younger
we're freaking yeah I'm an adult and I
just sometimes I just wish I can go back
just simpler times where my biggest
worry was having to get up and clean
let's talk about another one we look
back let's see we don't tell my next you
talk about Cuddy we talked about Ledisi
room five is another one that we grew up
listening to so I won't touch on that
one too much blackstreet man my
Blackstreet
Stevie Wonder there's two songs in the
album that I just absolutely love you
have to listen to them because they're
just such good songs
let's see Earth Wind and Fire let's talk
about that those are that's another
problem
more specifically the song Wonderland
and betcha
and on the way those songs they just
they touch my soul like I guess so I get
yeah I get I get highly emotional would
I listen to those songs because I'm just
like me and like I missed those days it
really makes you like miss growing up
they really do and then let's see let's
talk about Amy Winehouse now the Amy
Winehouse and the Mariah Carey those two
are actually not connected to my mom I
feel like they're more connected to my
aunt because I used to go cuz I mean I
kind of it was pretty awesome growing up
because we lived directly across the
street from my grandma's house so
whenever we wanted to go over there you
just cross the street and I used to go
over there and I would go upstairs I'll
run upstairs and my aunt had a little CD
player did they still you CD players
anymore I want a CD player and I would
put on those two albums and another
album as well I thought basically
everything she had up there but mainly
those two and I would just jam out and
just be in my own bubble and that was
just a really fun memory for me
especially Amy I love anyone else let's
see what else could we talk about let's
help her Kanye's album late registration
to me is like a classic but the one song
on that album that I still listen to
repetitively to this day is roses and I
remember I had an iPad iPad my iPad iPod
dang we haven't had an iPod so long I
forgot I pronounced it iPod I had an
iPod and I want to say it it was like a
hand-me-down from a friend I was just
happy to even have it or maybe she just
let me borrow it and I just kind of
borrowed it for a very long time and I
will listen to roses over and over and
over again that was my jam it was just
like to me it just takes me to such a
deep reflective space and I like music
that does that because it just makes you
think and to me I like thinking I don't
really know what I'm doing exactly but I
think this is coming out pretty good
let's talk about that u2 song I have on
there u2 is a band and they have a song
called beautiful day
and that song it used to bring me so
much happiness like man
used to bring me so much happiness I
remember me and are now we went for the
weekend to our friend Aaron's house and
Anna was super cool I haven't spoke to
anyone from high school honestly and I
hope she's doing good I really do but um
we went to her house and I don't know at
the time it just seemed so cool that we
were able to go over there pikas my mom
was really strict in the sense that she
didn't want to say anyone else's house
only because she was really protective
I'm not gonna say strict actually
protective because I feel like strict is
when you just kind of her just on one
but she just really protect it but she
just didn't want anything happened to us
and we stayed there for the weekend and
it was just so peaceful we decided to
have a picnic and we went to something I
think it's called the Berkeley Bowl bulb
not Bowl bulb one of those I always get
it wrong but we had a picnic and we
rolled bikes and as we rode our bikes on
the beach we listened to that song and
it was just one of the most peaceful
moments of my life I was just like wow
like this is just why can't every single
day be like this and honestly speaking
with high school I did I mean I feel
like for the most part I try to be like
the happiest I can be but high school
was kind of rough I could feel myself
getting red like on the inside because
whenever I do talk about like anything
personal I get really like nervous about
it but high school was just it wasn't
the best time I'll just say that I won't
go into too much detail but I don't know
I'm not really I don't open up a lot if
you guys I'm beeped that's why I'm like
I have some people who asked me to oh
you know like get more personal and I
was like
no because I don't know I just I like
being I'm very guarded they regard it I
need work on that but I am very guarded
this is a really gorgeous I look
actually anywho a lot of these songs
help me get through certain things now
obviously I mean a song can't help you
get through section a food stamps like
they can't get you through that it can't
get you through having a shitty dad it
can't get you through that kind of stuff
but it can make things feel a little bit
better and I think that's what I did
that's that good did so I can appreciate
that
like I'll have moments where I'm just
like you know really down and I can just
list our music this time music
grizzly-bear two weeks that song is
another song that has brought me to
really happy times you should listen to
it you should list all these songs I'm
naming honestly cuz they're all really
great songs are you guys living for this
I look because I am honestly speaking I
never realized how oh man I think that I
had some sort of realization but like it
never dawned on me how much music can
really truly impact your mood until it
was eighth grade and I had this
boyfriend like I don't know even count
that and he had severe anger issues but
he don't mean that whenever he listens
to plies his music it just does
something to his brain that makes him
one I like snap and do crazy and I
was like at the time I'm okay like what
are you talking about and then it's like
as you really list and music you realize
that the type of music you list it
really impacts your freaking mood so I
try to list for the most part happy
songs I don't like listening to certain
songs especially when I Drive because
it'll like make me have like road rage
and I already had that like on its own
as it is so I try my solicit certain
things times oh okay like like for
example like if I'm in traffic I'm not
gonna listed t grizzly because then I'm
be yelling everyone I'm gonna get mad so
I try to avoid certain songs so I'm
saying is to say you know like if you
want to like you know have a better mood
maybe look at the music you're listening
to because I think that it definitely
can toll the impact
differently as told by my eighth-grade
boyfriend can we focus on just kind of
knocking this under eye out i'ma stop
talking for a second cuz I've been
talking a lot
and as you can see on the album there is
just a little bit of a light shade so I
think I'm just gonna kind of use some
eye base in this little part right here
and you can put a little bit of a light
shadow right here nothing too light
though because I want to flow good with
this look
okay so here you guys have the finished
look and I I just I love love love how
it turned out I love it so much I love
the choice to not do brows because I
just feel like it's making these eyes
pop so much I love this lip shape choice
I just I am so in love and I think that
overall I just feel just like I don't
know I'm more satisfied happiness about
it knowing that it was inspired by one
of my favorite albums I'm just I just
can't say I came as out cheesing so yeah
this is what I came up with I hope you
guys liked this video and just like
hearing about my music choices I don't
know I feel like you actually know I've
never felt ashamed of my music selection
even though sometimes I do though okay
like I know that I don't listen to like
typically what a lot who will listen to
like I would choose these over a lot of
the new school stuff any day because it
just brings so much joy to me but yeah I
just I love the music that I listen to
I love the fact that my mom raised me
around with a good music and I'm able to
just cherish the music because of the
memories that I had growing up and I
just I like the emotion that it brings
out of me and I hope that music does the
same for you
but that is it for this video that is it
for this mission make a Monday yeah I
like how this turned out so much let me
