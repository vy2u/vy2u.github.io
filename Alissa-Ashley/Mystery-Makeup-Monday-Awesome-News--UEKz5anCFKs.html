well it'll be what you guys asked me for
and you guys asked me for our red looks
of here you have it all so the title
says have good news and the good news is
that I'm finally getting my own place
and yeah it's so stressful no one told
me it was gonna be this goddamn
stressful I moved in early September
September 2nd so I'm just really really
freaking out I haven't bought any
furniture yet I've been going to for two
places to kind of figure it out because
it's a really long process I've been
doing a lot so that's why I've been
really really stressed and yeah it's
been crazy it's been crazy so I'm just
letting you guys on it now because I'll
most likely kind of be missing in action
the last week of August because I'm
really got to buckle down and get
everything together and it's just gonna
be a lot cuz you know it's up my first
apartment I've never been this process
before so yeah I'm a little bit nervous
and moving in by myself it's a lot ok
for one person so but I will be doing a
little empty apartment tour so you guys
can see the place cuz it's really nice
and I'll be doing on periscope so be
sure to follow me on periscope and
Twitter because I usually like link the
Twitter to the periscope however you do
that
I do that so you guys can see it and all
that good stuff so be sure to do that
other match this is a pretty long intro
look at the time right now so light
bounce up out of here enjoy the video
you guys and if you liked it be sure to
give me a thumbs up and let me know what
else you like to see I'm really liked I
really liked it I liked it you guys have
seen the slow moves later I looked it so
hope you guys love that as well and I
love you guys ain't nothing odd to say
sass see you guys later and I hope you
guys enjoy the look hey hey oh God
dropping stuff already the first thing
I'm going to do is take my Urban Decay
primer potion and this is in the shape
Eton I'm just going to place as I love
my eyeball I'm going to blend this out
with a morphe
twenty-seventh splint blend blend all of
my eyeball
and with this kind of look it's pretty
important to have a nice prime eyeball
so that the red really pops otherwise
the red will not pop you want that
obviously I'm going to set that in place
with a loose powder is the colorless
powder this the kett cosmetics colorless
powder and I'm using this one just to
kind of experiment with setting my eye
with a different loose powder because
the Laura Mercier one that I'd normally
use I mean it's okay but I like this one
is a little bit thinner so it just kind
of sets it a little bit better without
making my eye fell out heavy now we're
going to dip into this rib where am I
going I'm going to take this Suva Beauty
palette and has a beautiful bloody red
in it and I'm going to place that all of
my ball with a morphe 330 brush I'm just
gonna really coat the brush in this red
hey go ahead and just sweep it across my
eye
and we feel like it's getting a little
bit too intense you can take a blank
eyeshadow this is the white eyeshadow in
the palette and I want to use white as
opposed to like a color eyeshadow
because I want to be all red all red so
I'm gonna take a white because all its
gonna do is just soften the red and make
into a lighter red and not a different
color I didn't I love it
I just like you applying the red and
time satisfied with how my eyes look
okay pretty satisfied moving on to the
next color
I'm going to take the Venus palette by
Lime Crime and I just took this one
because it's the only palette that I
have as a deep red it's the shade and
muse and I'm just going to place this oh
this a is oh a foot two to seven just
going to place this close to the crease
area as well as all over my lid
and I can start kind of blending it into
the crease a little more if I have on my
lid just really working it into their
little getting your dinner it'll back
into my 3:30 brush and just please
soften everything up a bit I'm gonna
take my Kat Von D a trooper liner and
just create a wing
I do have an awesome wing line tutorial
that got over a hundred thousand views
in a week which is awesome and you guys
go check that out I'll link it down
below don't up illicit don't
I've been such a goofy Booga kitty this
years okay BAM like a boss
okay okay so for my glitter I'm gonna
squeeze a little bit of Mac mixing
medium eyeliner on the back of my hand
and I'm gonna squeeze about this much
just a little bit and I've got to take
my Sephora Pro angled liner brush and
the glitter I'm using is from eye candy
cosmetics it's called cherry bomb and
I'm gonna just take the mixing medium
place it on to my wing and then dip into
the glitter and place that right on top
so let me go ahead and do this you guys
to just watch me speed through it and do
it in sections you don't want to put mix
meeting all over the wing and then go on
with the glitter because since that dry
up and you just want to take your time
with this so it comes out really nice
and pretty
okay I think we're pretty good I think
we're pretty good
next I'm quite a little bit of mascara
this is the Maybelline last less lash
chin sensational you can never say the
name and then for lashes I'm taking Lily
lash and stalk on next for underneath
the eye I'm taking this NARS Kirillov at
Velvet Matte lip pencil that's the place
in the waterline not all the way though
just about right here I'm then going to
go back into the Lime Crime palette and
take muse and this is a morphe in 408
and I'm just going to kind of smoke it
out a little bit just a little bit
nothing too extreme
I'm kind of connecting it to my wing so
that I all kind of flows together and
I'm dipping into my super beauty palette
taking that nice bright red I'm just a
place around your knees and I've got to
take that palette again and take the
white eyeshadow and I'm just going to
pop this right in the inner corner I
didn't want my inner corner to be shiny
because I really want the focus be on
the red I didn't want to leave too blank
either because I feel like that looks a
little bit weird so I decided why not
just apply some white eyeshadow so it's
a little bit highlighted but not too
overwhelming and I'm going to go ahead
and apply some bottom lash mascara and
then I will be done okay so let's go
ahead and warm up my conviction you
could take my Black Radiance soft is a
soft focus of just regular it's the
right way press powder and this is
bronze glow there's some more PE for
brush
I want to go ahead and just deep it in
my contours I'm taking cafe cuz bronze
glow is a little bit more soft and
cafe's a little bit more extremes since
I go ahead and just choose a little bit
more different blush I'm taking Nick's
double dare
I'm just taking any blush honestly this
is a orange blush I just don't want my
cheeks to be blank
I don't want to be super dominant either
but I just need to apply something
because right now it's a little bit
blast so see how you can you can kind of
tell it's a wine flush but not too much
and that's what I want because I want
the books being read but I don't apply a
red blush either click like that looks a
little bit cloudy
just this this will do then for blush
I'm going to take my Ruby kisses all
over glow this is light glow and then
apply this with my r-12 brush from
morphe this is from their new
collections of rolls clothes collection
very beautiful apply this very lightly
as you can see I went ahead deep in this
brow I'm taking my morphe slate gel
liner and my Sephora number 22 angled
brush and I'm just going over my brow
with that hey my wig is on I don't know
I don't the rat had me feeling like
Geisha bottom so I was okay like you
gotta throw in your black wig Alyssa
like you have to but I don't know look
Claire I do where do I write lipsticks
what my lipstick okay uh I'm wearing for
my lipstick I'm wearing colored rain
cherry blossom
I like this look look at me
no don't look at that part me so here is
the finished look and I'm just ready to
get to my slow moves to be honest with
you because I'm really liking this I
think it just has such like a feelin
sexy vibe it's like branches and sexy
color and I'm so glad you guys are
suggest Nix I would have never thought
to do any of this so hope you guys like
the look and if you do make sure to give
this video a thumbs up and yeah I just
like it's my slow moves now so I'll talk
to you guys later see you guys soon
let's go to those little moves now she
says let's make it so good relationships
