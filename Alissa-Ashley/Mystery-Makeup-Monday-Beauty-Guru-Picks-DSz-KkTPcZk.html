what's my sick nickname cuz I feel like
I'm always sick I need a nickname at
this point because I'm always sick sick
Lissa Alyssa sickly a sicker welcome
back to our channel today's video if you
cannot tell by the title or the
thumbnail or that back there is going to
be really exciting because I am bringing
back a series here on my channel that
you guys loved so much I am bringing
back mystery makeup Mondays for today's
mystery make a Monday theme I am going
to be incorporating some of my favorite
be the influencers as you can see at a
focus back there on the wheel basically
what's gonna go down is that we all have
our steps in our makeup we have primary
foundation concealer powder brows you
name it I am going to spin for each one
of those steps and whoever I land on I'm
gonna text them obviously or DM them and
I'm going to ask them what is their
go-to product like what's their go-to
primer and I'm gonna use that primer and
that is how we're gonna get down so I am
gonna spin the wheel for each step of my
makeup and we're gonna see who it lands
on and we're gonna see what becomes of
my face so if you guys want to see that
and just keep on watching and hope you
guys enjoy it
I tried to film this earlier but yeah I
feel like sometimes I sit down and I
film stuff I'm just like I can't done
that better I could have had a better
backdrop like this black is giving me
life and at first it was an ugly color
so basically I'm just very
unprofessional eyes know that so I had
to redo it I'm saying honest to say I
already did my spins and in all fairness
because I don't wanna waste people's
time for brows Gaby are you texting me
like a long paragraph about how he does
his brows because he landed on him so I
feel so bad if I basically made him have
to freaking pick something else if he
got landed on if he sent me his whole
so I love you guys we thank you so I'm
not gonna sniff a brows and also I'm not
gonna spin for eyeshadow because it
already landed on manis so we're gonna
pick primer foundation concealer setting
powder contour blush highlight and lips
so those are what we have to spin for so
let me make sure my wheels okay because
those come after where we want the
earlier but let's go ahead and pick
primer
oh okay so for primer we have Patrick
announced move on to foundation it's on
Patrick again I feel like my wheels
glitching so I have to tighten it to
make sure doesn't do that so for
foundation we have Katie that's so funny
because earlier it had landed on
foundation for Katie and I messaged her
and I was like update I said I have to
redo everything I was like so just wait
a second and she said okay so no
foundation I was like no foundation and
not to tell her that she's my foundation
pic but now for concealer
okay so we have Mariah for concealer
okay now for setting powder
we have Nicki percent a butter now for
contouring blush Wow I like to keep my
hand on my chair
okay contour blush me I'm lucky hacky
not happy it's Jackie okay who out of my
notes
come on a plain old spell tacky okay so
for for highlight I totally forgot but
when I spun the last time in Atlanta
Nikita and Nikita's she respond to my
text so fast so I'm still going to keep
the one that she told me to use because
like I just I feel bad if I had to like
read text people okay so I'm gonna keep
it as Nikita for highlight because that
was who the wheel chose earlier and I'm
still evil oh and let it be that so now
let's do lips Nikki text back so fast
hi Nikki if you're watching this hello
okay so help it's two lips
okay we gotta do it again cuz they re
later I'm alright
okay so flips we have James and then
let's go ahead and spin for a setting
spray as well because I just realized
that we didn't spin for a brows
eyeshadow or highlight on camera so
let's go ahead and give it a spin in and
let's just do say x-ray Nikita are you
out there putting a curse on my freaking
wheel okay so I have to text her
takis uh okay so we have every
influencer for every step of my routine
so I'm gonna go ahead and text them
hopefully I get a quick response so that
we can go ahead and do this makeup look
and see how it turns out the next day
so for primer Patrick said that he likes
to use the tatcha silk cream weightless
and the anti-aging moisture rich silk
extract I'm super excited to try it
because I've never tried it before but
Tasha has pretty good skincare so I have
some good expectations or high
expectations so this is what it looks
like
I guess you just use this and you just
dip into it don't eat that much yes for
foundation Katie said that her go-to
right now is the Armani luminous silk so
I went to Sephora and I picked up two
shades I picked up shades 9 and 10
because I maybe I'm just in denial but I
feel like 9 it's too light for me but
tints too dark so I'm gonna mix the two
to get my shade see this is 9 I mean
actually 9 looks like it's a it's a
decent shade match but we're gonna mix
in 10 because I bought it and
I'm just like yeah I look more tan
anyway cuz I'd like this make me look
like my I don't know I just wanna look
tan okay see how that looks more like me
see I love my crazy oh yeah I remember I
used to wear luminous silk back in the
day this was like 2014 he had 2014 I
remember I used to like use my check
from work and I would buy a bottle and I
would use it to the very last drop
because I mean this is a pretty pricey
foundation and I was like oMG like like
you know we're luminous silk is that a
turf we're luminous looked up right now
we're looking good I love the fact that
I look so hydrating I'm so glad because
I like the tachi moisturizer mixed with
this it's given me so much hydration
that I desperately need it in my life so
I am very thankful for the selections so
far
for concealer Mariah chose the NARS
radiant creamy concealer which I'm happy
about because this is also one of my
favorites
so this is just very easy for me to do
and I'm in the shade caramel reciting
powder we landed on Miss nikkietutorials
and she said that she likes to use
Maybelline fit me powder and Laura
Mercier's translucent powder and to
think of a new one because I haven't
used this in a while let me go ahead and
just open it up and Nikki says that she
likes to use the Maybelline fit me loose
powder under the eyes and Laura Mercier
on the face however I have the medium
deep fit me powder and that will
definitely not look good under the eyes
because it was just dark in my concealer
so I think I'm gonna do a swap and use
the fit me powder on the face and this
under the hi just so I don't lose that
brightness
go ahead and do our setting and then now
we're going to take the Maybelline fit
me loose powder for the rest of the face
and I'm switching over to my morphe 58
okay so now the base is on so now we're
gonna move into eyebrows and for
eyebrows we have Gavi and that was one
of my original spins before I had to
redo everything there explained in the
beginning so let's go ahead and open up
his text and see what instructions he
gave me
okay so first setting the brows with
benefit to brow gel okay let's see then
we're taking the APH brow definer and I
picked up the shade Auburn so bottom of
the brow okay so I did the bottom of the
brow and the tail with the brow definer
and then taking dip brow I haven't used
this in like man at least two years so
Wow
looks good to me
let's look at my regular brow but just a
different routine I don't know I like it
and now we're gonna move into the eyes
just like the brows I had already spun
for eyeshadow we landed on a mani and I
texted him and obviously I'm gonna do a
look using his palate duh and he told me
what lashes he wears as well and
honestly I'm a little bit scared because
I mean I used to wear lashes a lot but
now I don't so I feel like it's looking
really weird to see myself in falsies
again because I feel like I hardly ever
wear like dramatic bosses anymore but
let's go ahead and do some eye shadow
okay so for the eyes we are going to
recreate this yellow look because I was
your scroll nails at ooh that one looks
like it'll be fun to recreate and
according to the caption he used
obviously the lunar Beauty life's a drag
palette and he used the shades campy
legendary snatched and cake face so
let's see how close I can get to this
eye look
I'm living for this I look right now
because I would normally have this read
all the way up here but the fact that
it's so low I feel like it's making my
eye look so pretty
I'm so excited first and foremost I'm
gonna take cake face cuz the last shape
that he used and clearly that's in the
brow bone
and it's not listed in the description
but there's definitely some white holes
just took I'm high there's definitely
some right on the waterline so I'm gonna
put some on there okay
looks pretty spot-on to me now there
seems to be oh there's a winged liner
involved oMG okay we gotta do the winged
liner I didn't see the wing
looks pretty good to me to mascara time
and therefore lashes Manny said his
favorite lashes are Lily lashes in the
style Miami okay
so Jackie said that she likes the APH
powder bronzer so I picked up the shape
mahogany I'm hoping that I got the right
shade oh my goodness like I haven't worn
falsies like this in so long I forgot
how heavy they feel and just how they
look like I feel like I'd look crazy I
feel like I look so weird all right so
let's see if I picked at the right Jade
Kathy I'm a went a little too dark you
know so I'm gonna have to apply very
lightly and then for blush she said that
she likes this NARS liquid blush and
this is Hot Tin Roof it's a liquid blush
I just said that so I'm gonna shake mine
up because I already had mine ready and
then for highlight my original spin
lends it on Nikita and she says she
likes more feet and Bret my rocks babe
in a paradise and she likes vacation
that's the specific one she said
okay
so Philips James chose a VH matte
lipstick and this is honey I've actually
never tried the matte lipstick so blue
see how that goes and then Too Faced
melted latex liquefied high shine
lipstick in hopeless romantic and PS
James you caught a lip gloss and this I
was looking for lip gloss in the store I
was like where is two-faced lip gloss
and then I was that it's not under the
name lip gloss
so let's go ahead and try honey thank
you James because at first knuckle I I
was scared that it was gonna be too
light for me I was like oh no no no and
then let's take hopeless or romantic
liquid latex look behind I lifted this
is such a pretty this is a pretty
combo I look at my monitor right now
Wow I like it first thanks Brad we got J
kissa her real name is Jessica by like
saying J kissa and that's a YouTube name
so where's that car J kissa kissa we're
gonna take the Kat Von D lock-it makeup
setting missed my shake it I'm just
doing just because now I know why I went
to my morphe setting miss because you
just go H this is a workout okay so here
we have the finished look using some of
you guys's favorite influencers favorite
go-to products and this is how it turned
out
let's go ahead and just do a quick
breakdown so primer or a technomage
riser I like how that feels
I feel like it definitely set the tone
for my overall makeup which I like order
our mighty foundation I'm definitely
incorporating that especially into my
summer makeup routine because I forgot
how much I liked it eyes I love the eye
shadow I love the eye shadow but one
thing that I am just not here for at all
are these eyelashes I'm gonna take them
off so fast because they just feel so
heavy and you don't even realize like
how heavy false lashes aren t stop
wearing them or the more natural ones
I'm yeah I'm gonna lose all my with
these I'll definitely be revisiting some
of these products for sure and
incorporating them into my routine again
or just like as a new step because some
of these I really enjoy so yeah that is
