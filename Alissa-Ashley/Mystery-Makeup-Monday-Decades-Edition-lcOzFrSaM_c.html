first off I know I probably look crazy
because I have makeup my forehead and
nowhere else the reason being is because
I am just having like like I think it's
like the worst breakout situation I've
ever had and I just felt a little bit
better on camera if I did not like if I
had makeup on it cuz it just looks
really bad so that's that
but today's video is going to be another
mister you makeup Monday and the reason
why I don't have my base on is because I
don't know how my base is gonna be
because we are doing makeup from decades
I decided to put a bunch of decades on
the board I couldn't fill it up I have
like three empty spots I could not think
but we're gonna spin and we're gonna see
which decade or which time we land on
and our makeup is gonna be inspired by
that time so let's see what we have I
think I also look I look at alien
because I have no brows on let's see we
have 60s makeup we have makeup from the
future and that's just like my own
interpretation on what I think is gonna
look like all futuristic and whatnot we
have 70s we have 2018 which I'm hoping
we don't land on because I mean is there
dust on my chin I don't want that guy's
boring we have the 90s the 2000s and
then I decided to do 60s plus 90s
because I couldn't think of like another
combo so I decide okay like if we land
on that we could do a mixture of makeup
from the 60s and the 90s because those
are two my favorite like places for
makeup in time we have the 50s
we have 2010 we have the 80s and I think
re the 60s so we have high school and
high school is basically I'll have to do
my makeup how I did in high school and I
do not want to do that because I just
would be dragging myself so let's hope
we do not land on that but without
further ado because I look crazy I just
wanna I wanna I want to create in my
face I don't look at the alien let's go
ahead and spin and let's see we get a
making my will is
all one okay okay let me see there you
go
[Laughter]
we got the seventies okay now let me go
ahead and just put this wheel to the
side and let's Google some seventies
inspo okay so make up in the 70s and if
you're bummed out that I did land on a
time you want it don't worry I'm gonna
be spinning that wheel I'm not every
week but like we're gonna we're gonna do
that again so do you not worry okay so
let's see I'm looking dang there's so
many different 70s make up I I'm
getting the same vibe from a lot of
photos well it seems to be pastel was a
thing liner was a thing very soft lips
like nice just subtle lips and a lot of
these photos but definitely I've seen
pastel green about a good three to four
times so I think that we're gonna lean
to the pastel side I'm gonna start with
the top just still can this primer and
like this primer because I just like
it's just a very like natural primer and
I don't know to me if like some primers
they just make you skin feel better and
I like this is one of those primers and
when I cover it I'm sure you guys can
see the outline it's a really big mark
right now it's it's kind of bad like
yesterday my skin was actually raw
because it got that bad but I just felt
like some primers they just they make
your skin feel better and not worse next
I'm just gonna take NARS sheer glow and
this is the shade Tahoe and we're just
gonna pull a little bit of foundation
and this is a little bit to me I know it
looks like a lot and I think that in
order to blend it out I'm gonna take
this morphe 34 just so it's nice and
sheer go on my skin to look very skin
did they do highlighting and contouring
oh my god I don't think there's any wow
yeah the common factor in all these
photos is that there's no highlighting
and contouring it's just see that the
skin is just left like skin and there's
some blush it's a little bit of
contouring but yeah
I think after we did this foundation
which is gonna set our face and that's
gonna feel really weird but this is what
we have to do oh okay I'm gonna set my
face in place
for browse for a moment I'm just gonna
brush them out of the way because I
don't know what kind of brow direction I
want to go in and we're just gonna focus
on this eye shadow price shadow let's
see what we have yeah okay so this seems
to be a really common thing in a lot of
these photos that the eye shadow is
brought basically all the way up to the
brow and they still did that to kind of
not harsh a little bit harsh brow bone
highlight so that's what we're gonna
channel taking a mixture of two P Louise
eye basis because normally I just take
rumor three but I also took one of the
lighter ones just some of my face to be
really bright now for eye shadow like I
mentioned green seem to be popping up a
lot so I do want to go ahead and do some
green and it seems to be a nice pastel
green so I'm gonna take this Sigma creme
de cat or pressed color palette and this
has a lot of pastels and we're gonna
work with like these three kind of minty
bluish greenish shades down here okay it
seems that the eye shadow kind of went
kind of like on the side and a really
browned way so we're gonna we're gonna
follow that as well
and I'm going to take this shade up here
it's like a yellowy shade and we're
gonna use this like kind of like in the
brow bone area I'm gonna take this
Sephora liner this is their fine line
yes stylographic fine line micro felt
liner it's really thin and I'm just
gonna line my what do you call it my I'm
a designer
next I'll apply a little bit of white to
the brow bone and I'm gonna apply some
mascara to the top left
okay so as you can see I wiped off the
green underneath here because I feel
like I put too much and then upon
looking again it wasn't that much so I'm
just gonna take this little more feet in
five fifteen and I'll buy just a little
bit like really close to my waterline
and then for the bottom lashes I did
these little mimic lashes because it
seemed to be a trend back then as well
some of them they just use their natural
lashes but I definitely want to do this
because my natural bottom lashes they're
just not as popping as theirs now for
the brows I'm taking this new product by
milk makeup it's their cush fiber brow
and I'm using the shade Dutch it's not
out yet but I really like it
to create a nice natural brow
and I'm gonna go over it with a dark
brown eyeshadow just intensify as you
can see I went ahead and added
individual lashes on this side because I
feel like that's gonna vacuum the
hallway like they've decided to do right
now I'm gonna add individual lashes I'm
gonna add about four
next I will mattify my face a little bit
with some micro smooth powder and then
I'm gonna apply a heavy amount of
benefits California blush looks like
this isn't so keep it goes with the
theme
and then for the lips I feel like when
I'm looking at this there's so many
different lip options some of them
aren't bright others more toned down it
definitely seems like the natural tone
down lip was paired with this kind of
eye looks I guess we're gonna go ahead
and do that we're taking bite beauty's
smoked sitar and the rail apply gloss on
top because some of these look pretty
shiny and this is by I don't know
pronounces brand but this glass is
called mirth brilliant gloss
the 70s called they told me that they
want me to leave you guys and go to them
some bye okay so here you have the
finished look I got this wig and it's
funny because I actually bought this a
couple weeks ago I don't know how the
bangs go but I got this a couple weeks
ago and like I was supposed to use it
for a photoshoot and so funny because if
oh she was supposed to be like very
vintagey so I'm like wow it came in
handy it's in the photo shoot I looked a
mess but now I think that this goes with
the vibe I don't search a photo I took
and it's really cute but yes the
seventies the 70s at first honestly not
gonna lie I was like it's her Hamlet I
was so nervous about this look because I
just feel like it's so different than
what I'm used to and I just I feel like
I look like dated which I mean obviously
it's the 70s I was a while ago but then
I feel like I put the wig on and I feel
like it brought the overall like look
together even this like little jacket I
think everything just looks how I want
it to look so here you have a finished
look and I cannot wait to do another
decade because it's like this is really
fun and like I'm so like inspired that I
actually just want to go take photos
like and just create a vibe you know
like I just like this whole wide but one
of my favorite things about doing this
video and especially just twos in a
decade is because this is not a typical
I look that I would just aim for and
where I would never bring up my let me
move the wig I would never bring up my
eyeshadow that high up and I would never
blend it like in the way that it's
blended and I would never keep my brows
so natural especially when using an
eyeshadow like that's colorful usually I
like to do like you know my more defined
brows but the fact that this looks so
cute and it's not what I'm used to I
feel like that's what made me enjoy
doing this because I mean you just never
really know what to eat right so yeah
but that's exciting
so if you guys happen to recreate it
which I hope you do be sure to tag me
because I just I want to see it done I
want to see it I'm demanding to see it
but other than that that is it for this
video hope you guys enjoyed it thank you
guys so much for watching and I'll see
you guys in my next
blue peace out and I'm sorry my bangs
look crazy I tried but I don't know how
to do hair I don't know okay so I'll see
you guys next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
