so today's video I'm going to number
using my big wheel I'm going to use the
little handy dandy or go to text the
handy-dandy wheel that's online the last
time this occurs
yeah I had to supplant them foot injury
so it's kind of like it's kind of
bumming down my energy a bit so I'm just
kind of like I can't move around too
much to presume get my wheel everything
so hope you guys understand I don't know
what's wrong my foot I don't know but
yeah let's hope we get better okay so I
realized the wheels to the small go
ahead and add more colors off-camera so
now we're going to go ahead and spin I'm
going to happen a few times because we
get to the bass number 10
won't you see you okay forget some black
so ready something slow beat and then we
hand
we can't you two Black Swan dude with
green okay and red okay okay ah okay
I can't you do that I do that I'm going
to Limburg okay so let me go ahead and
kind of get situated do my colors
together and let's do this already so
I'm taking my tab on de vida loca
palette taking this shade right here I
don't think Excel Excel anymore about
type of around there I use it but then
again only have mini palettes that I
have a bunch of like color and this one
does so does I'm always using it what I
want to do I don't know why these it I
don't know what you okay is we're just
putting this green right here okay I
really have no vision right now I don't
know what I'm going to do
it doesn't come out there though but I
know I'm going to do carve on B team
you're watching this brings back maybe
the local power to the people already
have it do not apply buy it again if you
were to come out with and again put some
people who still send a great palette
like I'm so glad that I bought it when I
did you know that was a year ago
well then you're gone yeah it was a
while ago but when to better palette why
is no neighbors upstairs are always
making our movie noise what are they
doing in there
how do do okay and I'm going to take the
same green and put our needs too
behind here Britt yes okay we'll see
this is mega Deeks dirty martini all
right he's got our base down can you see
me
I'm going to take this Maui beauty I owe
ever come a gel waterproof liner and
grasp graphite thanks outside I got come
out the more we pay and I'm just placing
that I'm not creating a wing I just want
to underneath it or on this line lash
line
for my melt cosmetics pack I have like
all the scriptures super super huge I'm
taking the black and I'm doing to take
this morphe in 514 and I want to place a
little bit of black on the outer part I
Haeckel taking this milk cosmetics it's
the radioactive stack this is Zenon
and I'm just placing it as you see this
Greenbrier over here I'd kind of wanted
a brighter green to let it pop enough
for me
no spooky it wasn't popping it up for me
I want to add more and then I cannot
find my handy-dandy lash tweezers so I
had to do this off camera because I'm
just really bad at doing laughs so I my
tweezers but these are a little easier I
can't talk
let me laugh in the style Mykonos I'm so
stoked about it
so yeah I cannot apply my lashes without
my tweezers and I cannot find my
tweezers so yeah be right back cuz my
lashes are so dramatic I have to add
more green just that we can like you
know be more present on the eye because
you can see the lashes kind of really
overpowered self of them thumbs bringing
up the grain more right was I don't know
when I want to use for my parish I kind
of want blush for this look no I know
but I look weird but that asks blush I
would have a color okay I go into my
free free do that
go ahead make my brows a little bit more
bold because yes they're a little bit
too soft but it looks so I'm wanting to
get the lower bowl
see I'm making the browser roll can
instantly make the look looks better
except first I don't know the look was
okay because I'd known to fire but like
it just wasn't you know I mean like so
if you ever feel like something's
missing just kind of just assess every
little part of your face okay is it less
missing is a brow missing so I think
that definitely making that brows more
bowls really is porn the put together
now I look good all righty okay what I
want to do that looking at the
viewfinder you want doom it took some
Mac PC meeting liner on the back of my
hand
I'm just take a little right Nick and I
think oh god I'm trapped it I'm going to
supernova glitter by mega peak
that's a sparkler they're kind of messy
and get all over the place I get cards
on my hands but it's such a beautiful
glitter that I just kind of deal with
the mist but yeah you've been warned
go ahead and take this dose of color for
us it's concealer brush and I'm Steph
eyes glitter
not bad not yet but I feel like an
element is missing so I'm going to make
this eye shadow it is what is this one
this one is make a peak and it's in the
shape is this right here the green and I
want to take that and I want to put it
right here because I feel like ill
create mice ombre so that it's not just
oh no you kinda have to kind of blend a
little bit it's so hard to explain but
I'm going to do it and I'm going to
explain what I'm doing okay so basically
as you can see on this side it goes
wooder to matte eyeshadow and she's not
really that blended but if I add a
shadow that kind of has an iridescent
not a chunks glitter shadow but just
like a really smooth shadow it just
makes the blend much better and more
seamless as opposed to looking like
incomplete so that's not a tip for you I
don't want to add something too glittery
if I want the girl only focus right here
I want that to have a pop but then again
I can just leave that little middle part
blank because then we're going to look
at UM blended mix so I'm adding this
shadow because it matches the shadow
underneath so it's not really creating
any different color but it's just
creating a different texture so that
blends better with the glitter add a
little bit glow nothing too crazy
because I want to poke through the eyes
all right so I had change the lashes a
little bit well how can you change the
lashes a little bit I change the left
okay so I'm going to take the same lip
color now only applies in the center
because you cannot cheat we Happy's red
okay that's all right and I'm going to
take this NYX lip lacquer like raw now I
just look like a kind of sexy vampire
who just like job down with the new and
the red on my lips so we go ahead and
kind of put on an outfit just it all tie
up and of your back alright so why am i
doing who does that already so here we
have the finished moose here has a
finished look and you know we change the
background to you know match our very
sexy suggested vampire voice and yeah I
like it
I dig it it's an everyday wear I will
know this lip part is I think i'ma go
with a look like this like in this
another looks it's a kind of fitting
kind of vibe but yeah if you have our
finished look we got a black we got our
green and we got a little bit of red so
hope you guys enjoyed this video I know
my energy isn't like up there because
I'm like what's wrong with my leg or my
foot you know rxe now is my leg and my
foot I know it's a couple days so I
should probably more concerned but but
