green for yellow green and orange off
the board
so that we don't end up getting the same
thing over and over again let's do that
be fair oh okay we got red okay
I'm do red playing you somewhere right
now okay well firstly take this Urban
Decay primer potion because we're doing
red I caught on my base to be a little
bit more bright because I'm now it's not
the bright it
but apply the red and blend it out you
will not look like the clown okay we
will look at it I hope oh my god
I don't relieve the red and a lot of eye
looks so I'm we're just gonna see how
this turn in admin side makeup look here
you go
okay so gotta write down for the most
part now go ahead and spit with a
colored lipstick red off that's where
I'm like whenever it's spin like this so
look so come out where bullets okay but
what the hell man I'm on the flag okay
I'll challenge me okay I can do this
watch this watch my create you guys you
can just believe it's turning purple
maybe this is fine it was meant to be
more wearable okay let's get for one
more eye color
I shall color and then we're going to
crease magic here go ahead and take off
blue I mean we're going to work where do
you do it when I make it work with the
wheel lace close to my eyes now okay so
now we're going to focus on the eye look
master I'm doing but I think I'm onto
something I'm going to go ahead and
create something so go ahead and I'm
going to take this concealer brush and
I'll see this concealer and go ahead and
just kind of carve out my crease of it
they want something I think so I think
we'll make this work you know just to
play the cutter blank are
Oh
okay so as you see these looks like I
completely stopped talking I started to
look clear and seriously and this is why
I just came up with I was just really
focused so I'm so sorry
we're not talking to you guys I was
doing that but I just felt like we
really created look Lucia it's gonna
look good so I mean I like this these
are called as I normally would not wear
just on my eye because I'm very neutral
you cannot tell but I like this look I
like it's not go ahead and do the eye

i'ma go ahead lie back a powder on my
freaking hand where to come from
I've never go ahead and um do a blue
lips I mean why not you know like just
wanting on just keep your Lea nice and
fun
I'm gonna take my uh Nastasia palette
I'll do you new double lips
why not
a little puff
then for Coloma taking my own sake at
moonchild palace
I don't know it feels right to do that
okay so here's the finished look and I
love how it came out and the reason why
I like it is because I will it's just I
don't know I think that mr. Meighan
Mondays they kind of pushed me out of my
you know neutral comfort zone my moment
insane look and it just makes me get
really kind of creative and fun with
color and I know keeps me healthy so

fact that miss you make a buddy that's
