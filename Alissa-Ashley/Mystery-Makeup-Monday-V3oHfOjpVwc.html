Happy New Year I know that I have been
in my a for about a week but Happy New
Year it's so crazy that 2016 flew by I
feel like yeah time was just moving
really fast kind of scary
I'm 22 in February it's crazy but happy
new year hope everyone enjoyed their
holiday break and all that good stuff
hope you got whenever you want for
Christmas all I guess I hope you had a
good time but I am back and I decided to
bring back you guys really love mr.
makeup Monday so I want to bring them
back and I decided I'm going to do the
mystery makeup Monday with the wheel
because that's you guys love and I'll be
doing them every first and third Monday
of the month hope you guys enjoyed this
video if you are new to my channel the
mystery wheel is something that I did
I'm almost bad someone someone tells
them I did this like a couple months ago
and it was something that you guys
really loved but I've upgraded my wheel
since here's the old wheel so yeah I
definitely upgrade to a much better
wheel so yeah and what I do is I create
a makeup look based on the whatever the
wheel lands on so it's pretty fun and
people seem to like it so if you do I
hope you like it as well but let's just
get started I'm out of breath
we'come sick so let's just get started
hope you guys enjoyed okay so as you can
see not all the spots on the wheel are
covered because I couldn't think of many
I make up terms to try but on our wheel
we have glitter so in Atlanta glitter up
to create glitter i we have halo double
cut crease a matte eye so like no
shimmer a cut crease a smoky eye and a
glossy eye so whatever the wheel lands
on is I have to do so let's go ahead and
do our first spin let's do it wait okay
okay and this wheel it spins so much
better than the last one watch it's
actually spins last with it spin it off
but for two seconds so more fun okay
doesn't let anything go so fight okay
let's spin again
silly are you things aside okay a matte
eye is kind of boring but I'll roll with
it let's go ahead put the colors on the
board and I'll be right back okay so our
colors on the board so now we're going
to pick our crease shade and let's just
see with it okay can I hate kids with
color parks I'm just like oh my god like
what can I do
okay big spin for the colors come on
come on come on green that's what
happened last time and green the
terrible but okay I have some green on
me right here let's do it
wait what kind of I am doing a mat I
totally forgot what I am doing I'm like
what am i doing now okay so this is the
super beauty palette I think it's like
the same green I'd to you last time this
is the cupcakes and monsters it's so
nice it's really pigmented
and this is a zoeva two to eight
new speakers
and to be fun since the little wheel
lint on a mat I shout look I want to
spice it up someone new to crease Cubs
and runs the V like the outer part or
just really depends on what lands on but
we're going to spice it up so spin again
for another crease go

doesn't count or maybe no I don't have
any other green those they make it to
the dark green biome got yellow green so

great idea
okay so I locate the only gray that I
have and this is make up these concrete
jungle and I'm going to put this like on
the outer part of the eye debate hmm so

that would be a disaster
okay let's go ahead and move on to the
lid color let's see what we got here
