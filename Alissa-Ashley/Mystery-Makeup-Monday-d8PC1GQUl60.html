back to misty makeup Monday so as you
can see my face is kind of already done
and I just kind of have the eyes to do
and the reason for that to keep it real
and because I was getting ready to go do
a pose as my friend because he honest
fool you on the weekend but I thought
about it I'm like Alyssa get your
priorities together because why would
you stress yourself out and film your
miss you make a Monday video on Monday
knowing that you have other things to do
because you're leaving to LA at 6:00 in
the morning on Tuesday want to do this
so I decided I'm gonna go ahead and film
mine is doing a Monday video before me
now my friend because I got Authority
together man got together so eat me read
or okay so I have my wheel and we're
gonna do we get so we got dusty pink
flash roads so we're going to do a
really nice dusty pink look and then
just search it I went ahead and added
some options we have matte shimmery
glittery or gloss and got a pic for that
too we have dusty pink roads and then
it's going to be glittery we're gonna do
something glittery dusty pink Rosie okay
so my eyes are primed so I'm going to
take this morphe imply 13 as you have a
more Pecos and go ahead and use if you
want to I am NOT a code pusher but I do
feel like I should let you guys go have
to code more I'm gonna take make it be
petal pusher eyeshadow and I'm going to
apply it
obviously on a saucy of you might modern
ran soft palate and I'm going to go in
with a shade love letter I want to go on
to this very lightly because this is
more pink more pink make it just smear
you know it's got me more pink than what
I go for
I want to apply it lightly because I
think mixing these two colors is going
to give me a just be kind of pink shade
but you've gotta fly with a really light
hand because you do not want to OD on
the page if you're you want like a
cheese round a team right now and then I
need that mega sea shadow once again and
I'm gonna go on top of it to hopefully
bring out more of assessment as to the
look oh yeah I definitely made it more
dusty see sometimes you kinda layer
shadows in order to get the shadow you
want because I did a pedal pusher and
I'm stock yet and then this and then it
kind of made a little more ashes would
you kind of give me more justice that's
what I want
yeah I feel like if I just I feel like
if I were just so glitter on my lid
that's so like I mean you guys will hate
me and I hate myself as well because I
think that that should find equivalent
to a cut crease type of look so I think
I'm gonna carry this shadow first it's
going to you first I'm going to carry
this shadow onto my lid as well
essentially repeating the same steps to
just on the lid area so that I will just
go goodbye that everything matches up
I'm gonna take on its office Dusty
Rhodes little mystic and I'm going to
use it as a winged liner stick where's
the mirror
I'm always looking from here to see what
I'm doing I'm used for we landed today
I'm really hoping that it is dark enough
light enough to get the effect that I
want become a wipe off this brush little
bit fails because it has to brown and in
reading a little brown liner
then I take this girl Laxus Twitter it
called Sparkle champagne it's literally
like a rosy gold dusty rose go litter
five mils on hope that my AC doesn't
blow it away
I'm taking my mat mixing medium liner
and then I'm not sure what I'm going to
do by me I do it and then if I like it
I'll explain what I did this mess it's
the kind of hype I'm alright now
because I'm not sure about what I'm
doing right now nervous then I want to
seal all that glitter in place with more
mixing medium on top so don't get any
transforming because then our look will
not look cute
well that's drawing a little bit when I
go ahead and apply a little bit more
mascara because glitter dig it on my
mascara and that's never cute look go
ahead and take these lashes these are
from the deluxe beauty and they're in
the shade of the shade like I don't have
to shave what's up it's a style they are
misdial lucky and I'm using this tar
deist Pro lash glue next I'm going to
take a little bit of that honest toffee
of dusty rose liquid lipstick and I'm
going to take this morphe brush is
really nice tiny brush from one of their
collections and I'm just placing this on
mine this far the eye I never remember
was probably I do it I don't know why
I'm using this as a space for underneath
here now going back into the on Sophia
palette took your love letter
popping that right on top and then for
lips i'ma go ahead and take this price
tag - low prices it's only other star
Christina have on hand right now
now savings on the sake of dusty roses
lipstick and then for blush I'm taking
this pinky blush a dusty pink I want to
be puppy puppy puppy love I make a peak
and I'm taking this Anasazi in the coal
guerrero glow kit and I'm taking kitty
cat because it's pinky and tone just to
kind of me on here just to kind of stay
with the pink eNOS
and this is miss your makeup Monday so
we got to spice it up somehow because I
don't know I feel like this could just
easily just be a really simple basis
look and you guys come here to see a
little bit of fun so imma go ahead and
take this on top your love letter and
we're Sekhar into our brows teeth
that's why not you know why not have a
little bit of fun they take it and
makeup geek over to open it
save on bigamy color and just putting it
in the front of the brow even if I won't
show up much but I'm still gonna do I
got a zoom already so here we have the
finished look and I do not wear pink
this isn't necessary supposed to be
monochromatic but it's kind of it up
that way I am living for this look I'm
so living for it I'm so glad I decided
to kind of take this into a different
direction at the brows I made kind of
start doing colored brows because I
think it looks really good my blonde
hair what do you guys think let me know
let me know but hope you guys like this
make a Monday hope you guys like the
fact that I decided to kind of just I
don't pick a theme and run with it I
suppose taking a bunch of different
crazy colors and if you guys want to
just be crazy color the rampant let me
know that as well because you guys may
love it or if you want to get mix for
both just let me know give me your input
