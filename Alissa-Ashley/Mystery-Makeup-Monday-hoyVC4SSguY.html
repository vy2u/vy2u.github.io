welcome back mr. you make a Monday so
today's video is going to be Miss
Jamaica Mon Euler go through good I
decided to switch up a bit because I do
want to have somewhat of a theme and the
theme today is going to be well I'm
going to attempt to make something that
is kind of like spring inspired or just
colours they remind me of spring so as
you can see with my cheap scratch
handwriting I decided to write down
different colours why normally have some
of them are like you know the titling
colors but I added pastel colors because
pastel reminds me a lot of spring so I
want to create a nice look depending on
what the wheel decides for me so that is
what we are going to do now sometimes
like to spin in each color I'd be one by
one and I just do it but for the same
creating a more cohesive look and just
having a little bit more like yeah it
works better when I spin all the color
first and then do the look I create
something better cuz I can focus more so
I'm gonna go ahead and spin for the
colors and then we are going to sort it
so I think for today I want to spin for
about four colours and just kind of
workable Yap so let's go ahead and spin
we have pastel yellow let me write down
my nose got really bad memory I put in
my new me some menos pastillas
white okay put that down and the lawn
color
that's a week okay alrighty so we spun
for our colors let me go ahead and put
away the wheel get up close you guys can
see whatever them to create and yeah
let's go ahead and do that right now
okay so right now I'm feeling like an
armory will look kind of good
so that is we're going to try I'm going
to use a Kat Von D pastel goth palette
and I'm going take the shade star which
is the yellow and I'm going to throw
them in a corner and it some more p.m.
for 1:12 yet 112 I know I'm going to do
fly envision it in my hand so hope it
comes out the way Emma fissioning good
now for my pastel orange this shade in
here Clementine it shows up more like a
peachy color on me I'm gonna take that
one first but definitely gives me more
peach than it does orange and take as a
base though once that work - yeah I'm
gonna take it all the way down okay so
now that I have that kind of pastel
based on I'm going to take the cap on D
maybe the local parent and this is the
shade analog it's the orange shade and I
pack that right on top I'm going to
blend in a second but I want to pack my
colleague on the first alright a got
more feet in 3:30 brush just to soften
out that orange and get a nice herbal
end and then we take some more orange
and pack it right on top
really crazy I cannot tell you that and
then I'm going to thank the cam on Z me
videoclip Allegan and after so fast me
vida loca palette and this is the shape
swoon at the pinkish shade right there
so go ahead and use that same brush and
just pack that on on the outer part of
the eye packs have high hopes in this
look leaders gotta stick with demand cuz
yes I am high hopes
okay so our colors are packed on and I'm
gonna switch over to the m3 30 and
smooth the upper part of the eye a
little bit I'm gonna take clementines as
my kind of overall color just to soften
up this outer part of the eye sister are
do want to FaceTime I'm filming okay
might I also go ahead and go in in
detail and that means I'm going to
continue to work this color or these
colors together to give us my splendid
Tom satisfied
ok so now we're going to take this dose
of colors consumer brush and I'm going
to take some tart shaped cake concealer
and want to carve out our crease area
actually I kind of want to shape
t-account on do the eat in prior potion
shake Cannes comma dark so that goes
really weird if I do shape tape
all righty I'll kind of focus but what I
did was take the shapes goal in the
capital gob and I set that eating prior
potion to give me a white base this does
include the white I'll go ahead and do
the other eye and I'm your back okay so
I'm going to go ahead and take this eye
candy glitter it's in the shade sleigh
bells and it's not even so much to make
my lid glittery it just seems to make a
little bit more polished and neat
because it was tricky packing that white
eyeshadow on top so I just want to apply
something like on top of that to make it
look better
so this glitter is not really a color
it's just kind of white so we're still
sticking with our white color I've seen
you look better if it has some glitter
you look crazy
so before I continue I want to go ahead
and just highlight my under eye just
kind of get a better idea
I also want to clean up this eye when
I'm done with the eyes yet but do you
want to go ahead and just do my
highlighting because that will give me a
better idea of what this is all going to
look like as in to this
take my Maybelline shine freeman's
powder to set this
now back to the I've taken my in for 112
I'm going to take the shape star in the
pastel goth palette which is the yellow
I just want to brighten up this area
more neck and take this Physicians
Formula two and one last booster
basically an eye liner and I'm just
going to line my lashline I'm not
creating a wing I'd feel like it looks
better this is black I'm also using this
just get rid of some of the white that
have my lashes
and icons do the rest of face if I think
about what to do
we're next so I don't have to do it this
look yet so I'm gonna go ahead and dress
my face this is a more py4 and this is a
black radian contour palette a blessin
taking this l'oreal infallible
infallible pink blush palette I'm
thinking a mixture of the pink and the
peach go ahead and just define my brows
back again because they lost some of
their what do you call it definition and
I was prime my eye we go ahead mute out
my lips and a little bit of glow
okay so here we have the finished look
and I'm not the lied to you guys during
me doing this look I wanted to stop and
wipe it off so bad because I had no idea
I was going it was looking a little
weird to me I was okay what it what's
happening you know I was just freaking
out because I don't know I usually tend
to doubt myself a lot look certain look
somes okay those metella graders are
great but I was like you know Alyssa
just keep pushing through this look just
kind of find something about it that you
can really just make something happen
and that's what I did my overall really
love how does look freaking turd out
it's such a cute festive look the lips
really pull everything together my skin
looks all nice and just I look a little
fairy a little pink or yellow fairy so
hope you guys like how this look turned
out as much as I did if you did enjoy
this video be sure to give a thumbs up
and yet then you guys so much for
watching and I'll see you guys I mean I
stuff alone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
