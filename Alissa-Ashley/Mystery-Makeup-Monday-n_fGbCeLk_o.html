the morning and I was like bleep
adjusted and then I got snapped a little
bit and then I just I knocked out so it

a long time and I'm freaking tired I was
like you cannot not post if you Monday

services love you make commitment to
this so here we are
but I'm drinking tired it usually when
tired really goofy so I'm just like
apologizing for how easy I'm going to be
in advance okay I went ahead and put on
brows because as you didn't really feel
that complete and I told you got a
snapchat and send me some requests on
what to do for Jason to make a Monday
but no one's gonna do that
no one I mean I got a couple snacks
loading their hats and stuff but no one
seemed to help me so we're gonna go
ahead and keep doing doing some ago I
spent for the percolator yeah yeah okay
loving to do spoon really okay
when do
they're like give me some finger it some
changes a little pink boy band soft
paint
alrighty that worked out ok let me go
ahead and just prime these eyeballs oh
wait no wait I'm soaked up time out I'm
lipstick all night colors in advance and
then do the look because last time I did
it when you take them off one by one
okay yeah I got picked three clothes I
got mega demon I look crazy right now
but look that takes like two more colors
okay pink silver
these are great actually sounds like I
can mess with those or then do pink
something great they go up on my other
lids and get up close and let's let's
creep smack Excel me let's do it okay so
I went ahead and prime my eyes
off-camera and fix my brows and the
first shade of ill into is a great one
this is bedrock by mega Zeke and this is
a more feet r34 brush I thank our noble
con look I'm going to go for looking
forward to it so glad to place bedrock
all in the crease area oh we're going to
split all my power all over myself out
of the devastated moving on okay we're
going to take makeup geek so I get to
get out to show you guys this is
concrete jungle shown in camera it is
concrete jungle and it is deeper great
we're going to build this look and
lately I know I love using the morphe
r34 I've been using it for practically
everything look I do I just stick with
one brush I try to use like at least
amount of brush as possible it's not
intentional it's just that I was like
cleaning eating it so like this is like
the brush roller with for now until I am
normal easy anymore and I clean my
brushes yeah there's that
and let me also want to carry this on to
the lid to even or cover that part up
but it looks better and just overall
either looks better when we kind of
carried that down and then put the
column put on next I'm going to do this
first next I'm going to take colored
rain flashing light it's a really really
smooth buttery Silver Shadow and I'm
going to pop this on to my lid and this
is a royal and langnickel concealer
brush and I use it for basically
everything but this is amazing I love
using a concealer brush for the lid you
see more precision alright next I have
let this dry for looking up otherwise
I'll mess it up and in order to create a
deeper gray on the outer corner I'm
going to take a black eyeshadow first
and put it right on the outer edge
I'm going to take that make us Keith
concrete jungle and pack it on top and
then my trusty more deep breath go ahead
and form it out of course
okay so as you can see I went ahead and
did my foundation off-camera I did my
foundation routine my last videos I
didn't wish you guys time to be honest
so go ahead and Bend up the eye makeup
I'm going to take this you a slim cream
eyeliner this is matte black and yes
Elizabeth we're going to like I don't
know what I'm doing but I don't isolate
them on something so rely on line the
bottom part that I'm doing and then
quickly we're going to go ahead and take
the morphe in for 3/1 and smoke it out a
little bit we're going to sue the beauty
ballot are using up every single min to
make a Monday video she's losing a lot
of the beauty and take that hot paint
that you guys is fault
and pop that underneath kind of I add a
winged liner like that make much more
fierce what do you guys think well I
guess I'm gonna do it it was a minor
okay go for lashes I am wearing lashes
for this look I'm putting on our ferry
from house lashes so pop them on or I
have one on to make life easy for me
because the band on these are a little
bit difficult to work with but not as
bendy so it's so challenging getting
them on my eye and this one took like at
least ten minutes honestly let me know
just warning it clogged Ryan's go ahead
and pop on our blush I'm going to use
makeup geek clothes it's a soul mate yet
soulmate blush three nice rosy pink
blush just some work we are three
nevertheless I'm using the cold gray our
glow kit I'm taking kitty cat because it
has a pinky tone to it
different look far I might take on a
sock is with lipstick in Madison well
this is where I take initially it
doesn't work out we'll see what we'll do
I know this perfect this is work in
machen sies I'm go ahead and do my hair
to a decent individual and on your back
all righty so here we have the finished
look and also if there's something about
that's giving me like a was that the 80s
era like super bright colors there's
something about it that's give me that
vibe that's kind of where I was going
what they're kind of felted and I was
okay like you know go ahead and do this
directions off your neck yeah got it
down I've got your definite look like
more 80s if the color on here up top
like more blue or something but I don't
know differently about it being great
and then just having the top pink go on
from here to here that I'm really
feeling right now I'm have to kind of
like revisit this whole kind of style of
makeup get in the future so I hope you

happy that I got the energy is new
because I do not want to miss that I
