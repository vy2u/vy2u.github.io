Mondays and first and third Monday of
the month so here is the little third
Monday expect more of this month and I'm
I'm a depressed because I have been
chasing my cats now they're being so bad
there are toddlers and like crazy but I
was reading the comments and I took you
guys suggestions because I was trying to
guys how I want I don't know I don't
want any list to come up super crazy and
just insane so I want more like
organization or whatever so I looking at
suggestion so for each little episode I
would be trying different suggestions I
was given and I want to does feedback on
how you guys like it so I can know if I
will continue that or do a different the
next week you know I mean so we are
going to just a little bit different
today post event use the colored
for your choose the colors first and
then just do the makeup as opposed to
shopping each time so I'm able to kind
of create something a little more
cohesive Oh al so let's go ahead to the
colors I decided I wanted to about four
colors and then I put the creative look
with those four colors doesn't matter
where I put the colors bicycles with
those four colors so let's go ahead and
just pin zoom in dude shall we go
everyone and by the way the silver is
like ruined because we let the cat the
filler where else we do okay
you were to get here okay
we agreed green sendiri current color so
that bad memory of my nose because yes
actually the crack you were crazy
even I can work with I can do I'll peel
an orange the hell you say with this
okay
I'm like really nervous monopoly what's
up and all that we have gold oh how are
you okay
and we'll at color yellow I mean that
actually starting to be a great
combination depending on like you know
your what you can think of so let me go
ahead and put the one way now because we
fund for the colors and I'm a you know
set it up so you're able to see me a
little bit closer because last time is a
little bit far away so we're going to do
that okay so let's see the code again
that's bad memory so yellow orange green
and gold okay I named it start out with
the yellow just as my transition color
but they you know if I should link on a
white base to make the yellow more let's
go ahead and use this Urban Decay primer
potion this beaded it's pretty darn
bright and this is a more PE
twenty-eight
okay so I'm not going to set this
usually I would but I kind of want that
yellow Julie stick I'm not so I don't
take my super beauty palette I seem to
use this quite often on homebuilding and
I'm going to take this morphe m53 for
and unselect pack that right on top so
next I'm taking this matchbox was it the
cover shot bull's eye palette I'm
thinking yellow and that as well this
means we'll be warm warm I could be
wrong but it's kind of seems a little
more bright which I'm right it is making
a little bit brighter I just want to add
that right on top because I know the
yellows going to get lost and I put it
warns on top so I really want to be kind
of hopin these forms the words and next
going that paint palette taking the
orange that's orange really nice Alex
now that place I've right
right there when I'm doing it
see on in with the yellow being lost
what the yellows gone no longer love we
put more almost kind of blended don't
want this book to be kind of wearable
you know like I don't want to be crazy I
want all the books I do on them if you
make a money or community I don't want
that anymore but this got a cover shot
solidly nice I've only used a couple of
other ones I hadn't I used to Bulbul yet
and I'm like most recent years times
impress right now with how painted you
want me lor so good job good job
Smashbox company packing on this orange
I bring it a little further in on the
inner little corner we kind of artsy
look and then the kind of I don't know
I'm kind of going for something here I
would take the yellow and I'm going to
kind of dig it into the brow brow with a
brow bone just the brow really it kind
of make it so that it's like more focus
right here and then I also want to note
I don't want to do that you want to do
that no I don't want to do that I want
to know okay I'm not sitting here like
painting of a look at my head I have yet
I have a plan do this I don't plan go
through the plan here okay so I'm
thinking something I eat in primer
potions back on my hands first and then
I'm gonna take this more feet r-25 I'm
gonna carve out my crease clump it out a
little bit
okay so now we have a muted out I think
I want to put yellow but okay I don't
know why I'm going with my face on
yellow it seems fitting for the crease
area I think though but we'll see see
hombu okay if I'm gonna take this NYX

taking bids where that I'm taking this
color drain eyeshadow and this is this
is what superstar I'm gonna pack out on
top and this is the morphe in 41

a shimmery kind of yellow gold on top
and then I'm gonna take I'm going to
take it coloured raine saint-germain

green and the place this on the
waterline one without the morphe in for

highlight what you should have did
before til the cars I did not have my
peepers well for my highlight of my Kiko

because I feel like since there's so
much of bold
I shall look are going on the brows
aren't bold enough to kind of hold up
with it I'm going to go to the brown
little bit okay so here is the finished
look and while it is colorful it's more
cohesive than when I just kind of spin
