welcome to mystery make up Monday I know
I missed last Monday but I'm kind of
getting my life together because I'm in
the middle of moving still and
everything is still boxed up but you
should see my room right now
everything's still boxed up I knew I
couldn't eclectic other Monday and I
want to bring back
mrs. wheel and I know you guys have been
waiting to see the wheel again on my
channel I know I'm sorry okay but if you

single Monday I just upload a look and
you do not know what look it's gonna be

okay so I lost all my little sticky note
thingies the little things I created and
spent so much time working on I'm on the
move so we're gonna use a dry erase
marker today sorry if my handwriting is
kind of bad okay I'm sorry but you get
the point okay so as you can see I wrote
down a bunch of eyeshadow terms we have
a smokey eye a cut crease a glitter eye
a basic eye a halo ionic glossy eye so
I'm go ahead and spin this and we're
gonna see what I shadow look are doing
today okay so do glitter now have to go
ahead and race these and put some colors
and yeah just gives you time okay okay
so obviously we're not gonna just jump
into applying glitter on our eyes cuz
that's not even a look we choose our
crease color so one hand roll down two
colors and I'll go ahead and spin and
see what our crease color is gonna be
hmm purple okay so I'm glad and grab
some purple dipping our I have a palette
out using makeup geek and I'll be using
let's see this is curfews so it's a nice
purple eyeshadow and I'll go ahead and
place this in my crease the one we're
taking my life together and we use a
morphe m4 12 supply this
Kadima add a purple another purple
I've caught Carnival just to kind of
transition because it's like I want to
blend it obviously we're go ahead and
add that to can we look crazy
okay so my Purple's on now let's go
ahead and spin it again to see we'll get
the lid color one of my Lakers well it
is this okay guy go ahead get some wait
where's my yellow eyeshadow hold on okay
so since we got yellow I think we'll be
smart to blank out my lid so it actually
shows up so taking this NYX eye base and
this morphe in one sixty we'll go ahead
and clean up my lid
and then for my yellow I'm taking am a
feast
Lemondrop I'm at to apply a little bit
of mixing medium first just to get that
to stay on
actually kind of gritty that's not that
bad okay so now for the glitter as you
can see I took off purple and drain off
the board because I don't want this
looking the same as like the last night

gonna go ahead and spin this and see
look glitter for you today silver but
the yellow they a cover now but me apply

this as the base for my blue so it's
really showing up it's blue goddamn it
ok so I do want to do a winged liner
today that's opposed tough erasing these
colors and putting like wing styles I'm
going to keep the colors I'm a louse in
sight what color wing I should do let's
go ahead and spin it spin it so see will

have any green ok so I do have a green
liquid lipstick this is co-ed reigns IV
so I'll go ahead and use this degree
green wait' puts on my hand
if you feel I gotta do right now don't
say
to the other side
okay this wheels like now for
lashes I went ahead and wrote down the
names of these lashes right here these
are the ones I could find because all
the rooms are boxed up but I went and
wrote down the names because these will
not fit on the board so I guess I would
just be wearing whatever one they line
up just oh no fall let's just see that
there okay which one's that bad berry
I'm dropping the Maas we speak okay so
these are House of lashes better rent so
I guess I'll be wearing these today so
go ahead and pop these on you guys know
you're almost as funny okay so I'm so
lazy that usually when I you know apply
my lash glue to my lashes I don't really
let it dry I just kind of go ahead and
apply it and I'm almost complaining that
my eyes watering but my friend Joycelyn
she said the reason why it's water is
because I got my lash glue dry snack
tool I try and be patient she said wait
till like 30 seconds like do it all or
hmm so I guess I have to wait now oh
 don't drop it
hold on okay so be dry enough we're
gonna pop them on okay so now you go
ahead take a blush color go ahead and
spin this bad boy orange orange
