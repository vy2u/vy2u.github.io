why just eight - I just said Hecate tits
huh uses more soft I've said too much
you know
Oh anyways today's video is going to be
on this look that you see right here I
tweet it like a couple weeks ago at this
point that I want to do a video on faux
freckles so I decide to compile this
whole look I'm not gonna just do my base
off camera and then do the faux freckles
on camera no we're gonna do the whole
thing because I just want to do that I
didn't want to get screamed at so yeah
this is the look I came up with it's
just really nice and natural you have a
pop of a shimmer that will look really
great
just everywhere in photos in person it
just adds a sparkle to the look and then
you know your full freckles you have a
nice natural lip and everything just
looks pretty nice and cute so if you
guys want to see how I got this look
then just keep on watching and I hope
you guys enjoy it okay just a little
disclaimer I am in a great mood but my
throat for whatever reason hurts it's
been hurting like the last couple of
days I should probably medicate that but
yeah I'm just letting you know I've been
drinking tea but I mean I think I need
something stronger than that because it
just feels like look so if I am like low
energy that is why but just know that my
inside spirits they're very happy right
now I just can't really like a handsy
okay so I'm gonna go ahead and start off
by priming my face I'm gonna take I'm
gonna take the top chestal canvas primer
because I have been liking it
next I'll go ahead and apply my
foundation and I'm gonna take my cover
FX power play Foundation and I'm going
to show you in 85
okay so foundation is on and the reason
why I decide to use that one is because
it just looks so natural it looks almost
like a mixture between a mat and a
radiate foundation so it just looks just
very skin-like and that is what I'm
going for now let's go ahead and move on
to concealer for concealer I'm gonna go
ahead and take my color pop no fill to
concealer and this is a shade dark 40 I
feel like I could be wrong but they
changed the shade names I know they did
and I used to be tan 50 I feel like this
is tan 50 but just now it's called dark
40 I could be wrong but they look
exactly the same and then like always
I'm gonna take my makeup revolution
banana powder just set it in place
okay usually I would take my Sephora
micros with powder however a lot of you
guys are telling me that it is
discontinued so for the time being I
will step away from it because I know
it's a tease I'm gonna show you guys
another little technique to get the same
sort of smooth and airbrushed effect so
instead I'm gonna go ahead and take this
Laura Mercier translucent powder and
this is medium deep yes medium deep I
could tell it was just medium or deep
they're both medium deep I'm gonna dump
some into the cap add a little tiny
bottle and I'm gonna take I'm actually
not going to take the e58 I'm gonna take
this really fluffy brush from hourglass
and you could take any sort of brush
that is super duper like fluffed out
like this I'm gonna dip into it and I'm
just gonna swirl it around
and the reason I'm doing this is because
if I were to supply this straight to my
face
it'll be a little bit too dark for me to
be considered a translucent powder and
I'm actually glad that she made this
powder because it's definitely great for
deeper complexions but I do like the
fact that it gives me like a tint
because that is why I like the Sephora
my crease move because it just looks
better it looks better in photos it
doesn't look as makeup II I just like
how it looks so I'm just gonna take you
know light amounts and just swirl it on
so I still have a nice airbrushed effect
next when I go ahead and quickly fill in
our brows
for my next step I'm actually not gonna
clean it on my brow I'm just gonna go
ahead and just wipe away any sort of
excess oil because as you can see we get
a little bit of that and I'm just gonna
apply a brown eyeshadow from the Jaclyn
hill and morphe palette with a whi 16
brush over my eyes
and then to add the slightest little pop
to the eye just to make it just a little
bit more mmm I'm gonna take this little
shimmer ville by cover up X and this in
the shade moonstone
next I'm gonna go ahead and apply a
little bit of mascara okay so the eyes
are done let's go ahead and move on to
the rest of the face I'm gonna take this
morphe highlighting contour palette this
is 8h and instead of taking the contra
brushes that I normally use I'm gonna
take this hourglass brush because it's
really nice and fluffy I'm going to take
my little contour shades and just flush
it over my face just like this go around
the perimeter of my face and I'm going
to take the opposite end of the brush
for my nose next for blush I'm going to
go ahead and take a liquid blush because
I want this to look a super-duper it
natural I just want to look really
flushed and this is a NARAS liquid blush
and this is called Hot Tin Roof you want
to make sure you shake it up before you
use it otherwise it will come up be a
little bit hard to use and I'm gonna go
ahead and take this morphe 34 and just
dip it to the back of my hand see how
much I smeared it out I smeared it out a
lot because I do not want to mess up and
I'm gonna dab it onto my cheeks
and on top of that I'm going to take a
little bit of more fees MUA blush when
the blush palette and just kind of pack
it on top and then for highlight I'm
gonna keep it really minimal and just
dip into an eyeshadow palette and what
I'm doing is I'm taking just like a
muted cut of Manila shade just so I can
get a highlight without getting shimmer
me grab this so I want a highlight as
you can see it's creating a highlight
with no shimmer for lipstick so I'm
going to take these lipsticks by bite
Beauty and these are so nice these are
some of the new colors i swatched in my
hand the other night now it's like I
gotta use these so this one is in the
shade lit tumeric let me go ahead and
wipe it off because I mixed them so they
got a little mixed on the tube but this
what it looks like it's such a pretty
coral curl coral honestly I feel
inclined to kind of leave like this but
I know this other color sets it off and
this is smokers sitar I hope I'm
pronouncing it right see how it just
gives my lips just a nice little pout
and I have some coral so that just looks
really good with a whole look mm-hmm and
now for the last step the freckles
actually I lied before I get into my
freckles I want to do my little elf
daily hydration moisturizer trick where
I just take a little bit and just make
my skin look more skin light let me do
that first
okay now for the freckles for the
freckles I'm gonna take this product
right here and I'll also offer an
alternative option if you do not want to
buy this product but this product is
specifically made to create faux
freckles it's literally called Frek it
is so tiny and so cute and this is
literally how tiny it is let me give you
guys a comparison let's see what do you
guys let's see so this is glossy a's boy
brow if you're familiar with this and
this is brick so this is how tiny it is
i was actually surprised by how tiny it
was because i was not expecting that but
yeah it's tiny say tiny again tiny okay
so what you do is you take the product
and this one looks like it's really
small and i'm gonna go ahead and just
dab dab dab dab dab and as you can see
that looks really intense we're not
gonna leave it that way you take your
finger you press into them i have lotion
on my hand you press into them take some
more dab dab dab dab dab - yeah yeah
ring finger press them in
and then what you'll notice is that what
makes it look so natural is that when
you dab it you're dabbing off some of
that pigment and you're placing in
another area so they look really nice
and scattered so you will think okay I'm
gonna get just the placement that I got
but no once you debit they scatter and
then as you can see I waited a little
bit to dab them so these are more
intense than the other ones so honestly
speaking yes this is I want to say $22
but this is the best faux freckle
product that I've ever used and it's
also the best technique that I've ever
used but I will offer an alternative let
me just go ahead and do my little
freckles right now because I want to add
some more
we're gonna let these last ones sit a
little bit that way they're more intense
okay so here my little freckles and then
as a finishing touch I'm gonna go ahead
and take this little brush right here
I'm gonna wipe it off cuz I use it for
my blush I'm gonna take a little bit of
my Laura Mercier powder and just swirl
it around and just sweep on top and then
I want the lips to be a little more
toned downs I'm actually gonna wipe some
of the lipstick off and then like I
mentioned if you do not want to spend
your money on just a product strictly
for freckles you can buy this Stila stay
all day brow liner it's a brow color I
mean brow color it's a stay all day
waterproof brow color and this is medium
warm and before I got this product I use
this to do my freckles because of the
fact that I like the color of it because
I mean it's medium warm which means that
it's not too dark not too light it also
has like a mixture of a cool and warm
tone similar to this shade right here at
the freckle and what you do is you just
take it it's a little pin like this and
you just Don your freckles I'm not gonna
add any more cuz I really need any but
you just dab them on and then you press
them in so this is another alternative
technique that you can use but I like
the frec a lot and then lastly I'm I go
ahead and just set my whole face in
place where my working setting mist okay
so here you guys have the finished look
and I absolutely love how it turned out
I like little looks like this because
they're just so cute and you just feel
all cute so you just have a great day
because you feel cute so yeah that is it
for this video if you liked it be sure
to give it a thumbs up and I guess I'll
just see you guys in my next upload
