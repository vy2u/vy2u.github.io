today's video is going to be a little
review or like swatch first impressions
type video on the new Anasazi lip
palette and I'm go ahead and just swatch
all the colors on the lips and I'm gonna
maybe mix up a few shades to see what it
can do what is capable up so if you want
to see me do all that then just keep on
watching so here is how it came and I
think this is just the pr box um if
you're on the PR list I think it just
kind of comes to like a certain
packaging and it's really cute or it's
upside down
wow those upside down and here's how
comes it's really nice
I'm going to take it out of this thing
and this is the lip palette and this is
a Volume one and I'm going to go ahead
and assume that there will be more
palettes because why else will they name
it value one you know they're going to
be a volume two three we don't know and
this what it looks like it comes a
little mixing palette and here's what it
looks like I have not opened it yet this
is like really like a live first
impression so this one looks like and
let's see the shelf life is 12 months
you get uh point zero three ounces each
each little product thingy I don't know
I'm saying right now I'm terrible at
this this one looks like and it has the
numbers for you and I'm going to assume
whoa based on the packaging yeah okay
yeah so you can take this off if you
want to you can remove this little part
that has about numbers and you know the
labeling I'm gonna keep it on for the
sake of you know being able to show you
guys the colors it's open up the lip a
little lip applicator
so it comes out lip applicator so one
end has the applicator and the other end
has the spatula and then you have your
little mixing plate
this is the mixing place we'll finally
use this later and I'm just going to dip
straight into it for the swatches
because it's not like I'm a makeup
artist somebody uses anyone else
and I made sure to exfoliate my lips
just to make sure that I'm getting the
ruh-uh consistency of the product
because I don't hate anything more than
when someone does the lip swatch
something in their lips or heck of chap
and they're like oh you know this
product can really work out sucks like
too easily those chapped lips in order
to get the true results okay go ahead
and do number one first
so as you can see the liquor on the
crazy the lip color is so opaque that I
was able to just apply to my big ass
bottom lip and just do this and it got
on the top looks quite up the computers
go separately okay so here in shade
number one I know I look crazy I would
personally rock us with a brown lip
liner it actually has a kind of a
brownie chain here but yes here's a
number one first impression on this is
that it's extremely opaque I like the
fact that it's creamy but not super
creamy so it's actually not slipping
around my lips whatsoever it's very
comfortable very lightweight it's almost
like a matte kind of finish but not
super matte like it's not like drying
matte but I'm actually really impressed
because usually what kind of lip
palettes like this the colors are very
creamy and they kind of slip around and
you don't feel like they're going to say
very long but this feels really nice and
comfortable on the lips without being
too creamy so I definitely like it but
let's go ahead and find another color
cuz we're crazy
for the sake of saving time I'm actually
is my finger apply this that's in big
lips and this little lip brush is like
yeah I got big lips
let me use my trigger finger
don't dog day
we decided to turn
every day
of names
I was read
into the bag
take it back
me
thank you
you
say
forget all the things we say you can
take it back and take
and
you
okay so now you're done with all the
colors my lips are like you Alysa me and
chill so we're gonna do look a few
mixtures I'm just going to kind of just
play around with a little bit and just
see what I can create so yeah but these
are all the colors as you can see they
were all really nice and creamy and
opaque the only one or the weakest link
I would say is the yellow but maybe it's
because I did just my finger than not
with the brush so we'll just see
whenever I get this brush clean I just
want to mix it but yeah that was the
weakest link to me just based on my
swatches so let's go ahead and just mix
them together I'll take the white and
then see what else should I take oh wow
or no let's say blue and let's take
let's take this orange right here it's
like kind of like a crimps and orange
me mostly white pundits of war mm can I
add one more color to my little mixtures
let's add is color guilty
whoa huh the Helen I agree
it's very interesting color okay so
here's one creation holy crap it's rain
so Martha
Wow let's go ahead and like let's make
one more maybe like two more okay let's
see what should we use let's go ahead
and do this color a little bit of yellow
let's go and a little bit of white okay
see what we got now okay we've got a
little salmon color and now I want to
create one more color on a good green
yellow will you get the white too
and little too black we're good great
great that's on these before them right
now Kisuke green huh supply our Dookie
green
all righty okay should I close this
video out with the like less operate lip
color probably all right so that is it
for this video and my final verdict on
this product is I love it I think that
for what it's worth it is giving you a
lot of product and though the pant size
might look small a little goes a long
way you do not need that much product
whatsoever so will last you a long time
I also like the fact that it comes with
a little mixing palette in a little
brush and spatula because some products
that are of the same nature do not come
with that you do have to fight
individually so I can find it already
includes that as well I like the fact
that all the colors are really nice and
pigmented and opaque the only one that
fell a little bit short was the yellow
but for what it's worth the yellow still
looked quite nice because yellow is a
really hard color to ace other than that
all of the cream colors looked amazing
and I thought they all had really really
great formulas and all that good stuff I
just don't have anything bad to say
about it honestly I really don't I can't
do any bad and say about it
I think it's a great palette especially
people who like to create little stuff
and I also think it's great for people
who I mean just kind of want some really
nice lip colors because I think the
formula is great it's not sticky
whatsoever as you can see I'm doing back
and it's not sticky it's not too creamy
it's not moving around too much it's
really nice and flat so giving me a nice
color and I want to mix them they're
creamy enough to mix so hope that makes
things if at all but yeah that's my
final verdict if you guys like review
videos like this be sure to give a
thumbs up and let me know what else you
want me to review but other that hope
you guys enjoyed it and now see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
