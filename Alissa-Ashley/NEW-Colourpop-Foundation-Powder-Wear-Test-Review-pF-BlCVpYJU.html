for today's video we are going to be
doing a review and why am i clapping and
every single word where are we doing
here whew and we're test on the new
color pop no filter foundation
they also made no filter setting powders
so we'll be using those today as well so
yeah that's that's basically what we're
doing it so that's what's going down so
if you guys want to see that then just
keep on watching and I hope you guys
enjoy also make sure that you are
subscribed to my channel because I mean
yeah you should be doing that if you're
watching my videos so go ahead and
subscribe ok I want to jump right into
it only because like my forehead all my
nails - I'm just in shambles but like
basically I kind of like I use this
product and then like it just did this
so now like it's just it's not fun ok so
I just want to make up on it is what I'm
trying to say so the first thing that I
want to do is moisturize I'm already
moisturized but I feel like this is like
a it's like a moisturizing primer I'm
gonna take the in broglie's cream just
so I can put it on my face while I talk
about the foundation because I want to
kind of like soak in so let's go ahead
and just pop that on right this second
vino filter foundation let's go ahead
and open it up so here is the box
well obviously like if you order you're
not going to get this but this is what
they sent me
and honestly I am convinced that I look
much lighter in photos and videos I
thought I looked really tan but I guess
I don't because they sent me as you can
see little sample sizes and they send 3
bottles of what they think could
possibly your match and this is let me
show you guys I was like come on man
this is the one they sent me that is the
darkest they won they sent me so I'm
just I'm convinced that maybe I just
need just my lighting because I feel
like I don't look that light but I guess
I do so without further ado let me go
ahead and figure out my shade let's see
I think I'm just gonna go ahead and just
test out a few so this is medium dark 40
okay yet this does not mean does not
mean let's see this is medium-dark 45
That's not me
this is dark 150 I flip okay we're
getting close we're getting close I feel
like if I were to blend this one out and
make okay this is dark 155 okay we're
getting better I'd like this undertone
is more yellowy than this one and let's
do one more so this is dark 160 damn I
don't know which one I am I have to
blend them out I feel like we're gonna
try like I wanna try this one what if
it's too dark
let's see so this is dark 160 I'm gonna
take this morphe g40 and let's just see
what this is looking like okay I think I
did a good pretty good match let's see
this is one side with and then one side
without I fight the coverage looks
really natural and pretty very skin-like
so let's go ahead and do the other side
and I think for the other side we're
gonna blend out with the brush for brush
this is the Sigma f80 flat kabuki I have
a love-hate relationships with brands
make a lot of shades because then it
just makes it so much more difficult to
figure out which one is my shade and I
want to make sure I get it right because
like I want to be able to make sure the
people that use me as a shade reference
get their right shade let's see how it
covers my breakout they covered it
pretty well okay so the foundation is on
this is about 2 coats of foundation I
think it looks really good it looks
really skin like in person especially so
I am so far so so good now for a
concealer you guys are probably
expecting me to use the color problem no
filter concealer however I
out I do not have anymore literally
every single one that I picked up was
scraped away because I use it so much
and we already know I love that but I
still want to of course conceal on
camera to show you guys the setting
powders so I'm gonna take this new
bareMinerals bear pro concealer I
actually picked it up yesterday this is
tan dark neutral this felt really good
in stores so I will definitely update
you guys on how I'm liking this at the
end the video as well because I mean
what if it's fire league then I'll be
able to let you guys know so let's go
ahead and blend blend blend and then let
me get my powder ready before blending
out the under-eye because I like to set
immediately after it so for the setting
powders they came out with the no filter
setting powder and then the no filter
sheer pressed powder so for the setting
powder they have translucent banana and
medium deep and then for the sheer
pressed powder they have fair light
medium medium dark dark and deep dark I
cannot begin to express how happy I am
that there's a deep dark in there
because usually brands they cut off at
dark so they'll have like fair fair
light light medium light medium light
just a bunch of variations of light and
then they just go dark so I'm glad that
there is a medium dark a dark and a deep
dark and then you have the fair light
medium so it's a pretty even little
balance so I appreciate that and also
I'm happy that they can with a medium
deep setting powder because obviously I
mean yeah I feel like this shade right
here will be pretty good for deeper
complexion it's like it looks like a
really nice setting powder so it looks
kind of like the same tint as the Laura
Mercier one the deep one she made so I
am happy about that so let me go ahead
and get the banana one ready because I
do play I use the banana one for under
my eye this looks really promising I'm
actually extremely excited to try a new
powder and then I think that for the
rest of the face I'll probably do the
translucent they've done some out okay
so similar to the Laura Mercier
translucent it has a nice little tint to
it so I appreciate that
because I tend to stay far away from the
powders with no color and then let's see
I'm trying get everything ready before I
even start to blend my under-eye because
once I do that yeah so let's see for the
sheer pressed powder I think I'm gonna
use the shade medium dark
I'm the sheer pressed powder maybe kind
of so much of how I use my Sephora Micro
smooth we'll have to see once we're done
setting but I do want to try out one of
these sheer pressed powders okay so now
that we're done talking let's get to
blending the other eye and setting it
this concealer feels bombed by the way
usually I stay far away from stick
concealers because they tend to be a
super duper duper duper oily but this
one I mean it does not seem that way at
all it seems to be really nice coverage
so hey we may have discovered a really
nice consumer as well but we have to see
it in the day but the color of this
concealer is nice as well oh I really
hope I like it because I've been trying
to look for a new concealer to use just
because I like to switch it up a bit so
if I like it I'm gonna go pick up more
so now let's dip into this banana powder
and let's see if it's nice
so far so good I'm excited oh yes this
is bright like my future I'm sorry
and then let's dip into the translucent
one for the rest of the face you know
this does to weigh some of that powder
with a more PE 58 and then even though
we already look good and honestly
speaking I'm low-key I get excited like
a kid evil eye I am so excited cuz I
feel like I look so good I was honestly
scared because I mean I want to take
pictures today so I need to look cute
I'm gonna take the no filter shear
pressed powder we're gonna take medium
dark just kind of want to just just tap
it on my face and see we don't really
need it but I just kind of want to like
just put it on my face just makes a
difference I think we look good I think
we look good so here is what we're
looking like honestly this looks so good
for one I am so excited about that bare
minerals concealer because I'm telling
you guys like well some concealers are
used they will be creasing right now and
I don't have to like kind of push in
extra powder I did not have to do that
so we might have found a really good
concealer as well and the foundation
looks good and smooth that banana powder
was nice that translucent powder was
good it did not make me look great I'm
excited like I'm so let me go ahead and
just spray my face this is what I like
to do ok so right now it is 12:00 p.m.
so we have a full day I'm gonna try it
wear it till about 9:00 p.m. just
collect like about 9 9 now it's pretty
good 10 hours and we're gonna see our
last I think that this looks flawless I
am super excited because man I mean I
just feel like when the colour-pop first
came out it's like they were good I feel
like they're getting so much better
because I mean they're litter
taking over the game like
I feel like they're creating so many
cool products that are like good and
affordable so if this stuff works out I
am going to be extremely impressed and
I'll let you guys know my final thoughts
at the end once we've had a full day of
wear and it's hot today so we're able to
see how it battles against the Sun - so
we're chillin
so I'll really go ahead and just do the
rest of my face and everything probably
just brows and stuff and then I will
check in with you guys at the end of the
day to let you guys know how all this
held up okay it is now 937 yes I am on
wallpaper it is 9:30 7:00 p.m. I came
over if I was at 11 or 12 when I finish
my makeup but here is what we're looking
like I got new necklace today here is
what we are looking like after insert
amount of hours aware because I do not
know math here is what we're looking
like and today was hot oh my gosh
there were certain parts of the day
where I literally had a sweat stash like
actual sweats - so today was a very very
hot day and I honestly I feel like with
how hot it was how much I was moving
around cuz I shopped all day literally I
think that this looks really freaking
good for $12 I think I think it looks
good you got clothes granted I did get
sweaty but for what it's worth I think
that it looks really good like I think
what's good and honestly speaking like
it didn't even start to get like this
until maybe like 8 o'clock so I feel
like it held up really well this is with
no touch-ups
so yes the bare minerals concealer it
lasted beautifully it didn't crease up
it didn't get all dry it looks really
good I do see oil mainly right here and
right here so yeah that's where I
usually get oily and that's where I
usually get hot I feel like even like
just in my hot studio I feel like I'm
starting to get a little bit oily but
honestly wait where is that where's that
darn powder let me see all it'll take is
just a little bit of powder let's see
this is the pressed powder by the way
shine Patrol boo boo boo and I feel like
just with that touch-up literally took
ten seconds we practically look like new
there are a little bit of creasing in
the smile line area but I've definitely
seen that area look way more mamie I
don't know to me overall I think that
this last step pretty darn amazing and
maybe it was the combination of the
foundation and the no filter setting
powders but whatever it was it works for
me and I think that definitely for that
price point I would highly recommend
giving this foundation and giving these
powders a try because yeah I was a
little bit scared because I was okay
like you know sometimes these things
don't go well and they look a little bit
like a crazy oily slippery disaster and
in the day but I don't think we got that
and I feel really happy with it and I
would highly recommend it I approve so
yeah that's all I got to say I kind of
want to spray myself with this setting
spray it's so hot in here but that is it
