find today's video it's totally random
by the way but I just got this vault
we're gonna show you guys I just got
this from colour-pop in the mail and
it's their new Lux lipsticks and
honestly I need to know about it I just
have to go on the page and I'll say oh
the new lipsticks there's 24 shades
there are $7 and I believe they launched
on the 31st of this month so I was like
why not go ahead and just swatch them
all on my lips for you guys so you guys
can see which colors you want and all
that good stuff and yeah that's really
it so if you guys want to see that then
just keep on watching and hope you guys
enjoy it
dude I would be lying if I said that
these weren't so fucking good like a
couple is so good I was watching them
right now and they're all so creamy and
pigmented and I'm just like colour-pop
why are you coming for my life
okay so now that I have swatched
all of them here are my thoughts on them
honestly speaking these are an extremely
good formula they are so creamy and also
extremely opaque because I'm not sure if
you guys can tell when I started but I
had like this really weird balloon right
on my lips I'm not sure what lip
products I used today that caused that
but I'm gonna get to the bottom of it I
have that on my lips and it literally
covered that even with the lightest
lipstick shades and that is that's a
good thing that means that they're
extremely opaque and pigmented and they
are so creamy I already said that I know
but I just want to put them on all day
because they're super creamy the only
thing I would say is that as you guys
can see as I was getting to the end
shades they began to stain so I'm not
really a huge fan of lipsticks that's
staying while a lot of them do stain
especially the pink ones pink lipsticks
always stay my lips I don't care what
formula they always leave a pink stain
so honestly am I gonna diss it for that
and say oh don't get it
not really because I mean every pink
lipstick I've used has definitely
probably stayed in my lips before I may
not like one that didn't but most of
them stay in my lips so I can't really
fault them for that but aside from that
I like them a lot I like the fact that
they're kind of really creamy but not
she Mia so I'm getting a little bit of
shine on them but they're not like
moving around on my lips that make sense
at all and they're also not sudra matte
if you'll extremely comfortable I like
them I like them a lot I loved the first
ones I was watching because I just
showed how pigmented they are and the
last one I just left them on actually
I'm lying I'm like every single shade
even though granted of course am I gonna
wear the SuperDuper pale ones probably
not maybe in the center that is it for
this
video if you guys liked it be sure to
give it a thumbs up and let me know
which shades were your personal favorite
and which one you guys plan on getting
but other than that thank you guys so
much for watching and I'll see you guys
in my next video
peace out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
