for today's video there's an inner plane
going by and they always decide to do it
about to film for today's video I am
going to be reviewing some new products
and they're gonna be skin based not
skincare based but like you guys know
like face products I'm gonna do a
foundation and two concealer that both
new in the streets
I really review the new bobbi brown skin
long we're weightless foundation and I
also got these in the mail by Beauty
bakery and these are called the cake
face concealers so I'm gonna be trying
them both out today to give you guys my
thoughts so if you guys want to see that
then just keep on watching first I'm
gonna go ahead and pry my skin I'm gonna
use my Sicily primer because I'm your
bit who I'm running low and I'm so glad
because I bought a new one last night
and then for a foundation we're gonna
try the Bobby Brown and I picked up a
couple of shades
I have 6.25 which is cool golden which i
think is my shade and then I also picked
a five which is honey and then 6.75
which is gold and almond I just picked
up a few just to see I'm gonna shake it
up a bit let's see the claims full cover
oil free shine control let's see how
much do you get one fluid ounce it's a
full longer coverage that looks and
feels like skin not masky heavy or cakey
this high-performance oil-free formula
creates a poreless shine free finish
with incredibly comfortable day to night
wear stays fresh all day and into the
night with coverage that lasts even in
hot and humid climates instantly
mattifies oily skin for a natural look
that is never dry dull or flat it helps
minimize oil throughout the day and
reduces the appearance of pores over
time okay let's try it out so let me go
ahead just pump out I'm gonna try cool
golden because I think that's my shade
and I'm gonna use a sponge for one side
and a brush for the other just to see
how they do that looks like a pretty
decent shape hmm okay cool and mostly
Zen I'm actually really nice okay so I'm
gonna go ahead and use my morphe sponge
just to put on this side to see what
we're looking like I'll just go back I
think this is good match
it's funny because like I had tried to
this review before and it just was not
flowing well because I feel like
everything was going terrible so I
didn't even get to really wear it or
finish it and one of the reasons why is
because I mean yeah everything was just
going to tear over my makeup that day
and also one thing I did know when I did
try to review it was that I did not like
the fragrance I feel like it was very
very heavy I'm not smelling it so much
now so maybe it have to do with the fact
that I was calm like sick I don't really
know why but I was smiling at him heavy
and hardcore that day when I was trying
but I mean nothing was working on that
day so I was like I give up on filming
whoo so this is like my first real
impression and it looks really good no
I'm able to blend it out and wear it
okay so it's definitely Matt I can see
that but I think that they are not lines
and not cinemas they're not frauds
because it's matte but it still looks
like skin and I think wasn't that one of
the claims were like you look matte but
not dull because there's definitely been
matte foundation so I'm so Kay like what
is this but this one isn't giving me
that I still look good nice and radiant
but still mattify it that's cool now
let's go ahead and take a brush to line
up this side for my brush I'm gonna take
the morphe white eight and I'm just
gonna go ahead and blend it out I'm
gonna be guessing see but I feel like
the longer its sat it was oxidizing on
this side cuz as I blend it out now it's
kind of turning a different color back
to the color when I first applied it but
it definitely seemed that it was kind of
doing some oxidizing over here it
doesn't look bad but I definitely think
I saw it I think that's one my I saw it
oxidizing am gaining hmmm I feel like
with the brush and maybe it's cuz it was
sitting for a long time it's not
blending as even I may have to go over
with the sponge because I feel like
there's some parts that are like
blending weird and
I'm seeing little brushstrokes but I
don't want to blame the foundation for
that because it could have been because
it was sitting and usually Mac
foundations they tend to dry quicker
than like a dewy foundation so it could
be me or letting it sit for two months
I'm not gonna have fault it for that I
also kind of want to add another layer
to see like is it buildable so we're
going to see but I'm definitely the
sponge because I feel like that I don't
know is better for me personally okay so
it looks really good I was able to add
another layer without it becoming too
thick so that's a good side I think I'm
not sewing pretty as you can see it's
not super shiny or shiny so I may not
you have to set it as much as I like you
normally set my do your foundations
because it's very matte so I don't want
to look too matte something so far so
good let's go ahead and get to these
concealers come quite excited about it
okay so for the concealers I'm not quite
sure which shade I'm gonna use let's see
there are one two three four five six
seven eight shades let me go ahead and
swatch them on my arm and then show you
guys
okay so right off the bat I could
definitely tell that these concealers
they have almost kind of the same
formula or I don't want to misspeak but
I know that the beauty bakery lipsticks
they dried down they stay in place this
concealer I don't know if you guys can
see but it is like very like it's on
there because normally with concealers
I'm able to can I just wipe them away
but you could tell the longer they stay
on the longer they dry down I'm
hopefully that that goes well on my face
we're gonna find out but this is this
foundation it's definitely kind of
oxidized it's definitely I'm really
oxidizing a little bit okay okay so I'm
gonna go ahead to the shade Pro pearl
caffeinated and we're gonna go ahead and
use this to highlight given how it was
drawing down on my arm I think I'm a
doing in sections because something
tells me if I just let it sit it'll dry
down so we're gonna do the forehead
first it said Melissa my red shade or
hope so or maybe it just looks really
light compared to the oxidizing
foundation
okay cool okay not collide first I was
scared I don't know if you guys can see
when I would do it it didn't seem like
it was budging but the more and more you
start to blend it you have to really
blend it it looks really nice because
you guys saw when I first put it on it
looked like it was going to look crazy
but now I think that it looks really
beautiful and that golden undertone is
really like shining through and I think
it looks pretty good it's not as like
what would you say I don't know it's
hard to describe it like it's kind of
blend it into my skin almost to the
point where it like it's not a super
highlighted effect which sometimes I do
like more highlights are may add a
second layer time to this side but I
mean I think it looks good I don't think
it's bad now let's go ahead and do a
second layer just to see how we're
looking at it see if it's buildable
because I do want more brightness in
this for sure
okay so far we are definitely liking
this concealer because I like the fact
that that first layer very toned down
but when you do out on top it's looking
pretty good I like this so far for those
scared
no okay so I think that after doing that
I have some hope because the first that
foundation hmm and then I saw the color
of this else okay like it's too light
but I think it's all kind of coming
together so that's go ahead and set it
in place because I mean I'm kind of
excited now to set my under eye and
highlight I'm going to use the bakery
power because I don't know it just feels
right to do so and this is yellow it's
their flower setting powder
and I'm going to go ahead and take my
micro smooth powder this is a for micros
and Shaytan and my more if you eat UD 8
and we're just gonna do what I always do
just buff away everything as you can see
I didn't put too much oh yeah this one
Dacians very much I didn't put too much
powder and I can feel the madness like
so you don't need to do too much
hardcore setting with this foundation
under eyes looking good nice and warm
and golden which I'd like to look okay
so here's how we're looking and I'm very
pleasantly pleased with this because I
feel like I love it with my under eye
looks really nice and golden and not
ashy or just crazy it looks very nice
and golden and beautiful it's set really
well the foundation looks really nice so
now I'm gonna go ahead and do the rest
of my face for the day and then I'll be
right back let you guys know how it's
looking and get a little check for the
time and I'm gonna go throughout my day
with this on and we're gonna come back
and see how it lasted I have high hopes
in it because this looks really
beautiful so we're gonna see we are
going to see okay so here is what we're
looking like I just add some blush
contour liner it makes it use it the
rest of my face but I try not to add too
much to the skin at just some contour
blush I didn't do any highlight I just
want to keep it nice and flat and matte
because I'm actually really liking it a
lot I think that this base is beautiful
it's really nice I like it a lot so
we're gonna see how it lasts about the
day whenever I look over here is my
monitor by the way cuz I'm just like so
I'm gonna wear this throughout the day I
love this concealer so far I love the
shade of it I just I just love it so I'm
hoping that it lasts about the day so it
could become one of my concealers in my
rotation and this foundation looks
really good
normally I lean towards a more dewy
foundation but this looks good
this looks really good so we're gonna
see how it lasts I'm gonna give it some
hours and I'll be back with you guys to
see how they kept up it is sunny today
so I am glad because I don't know I
thought you can't really tell the wear
of something with the weather it's like
more cold you can really tell the same
power when that Sun is out just beaming
on you so we're gonna see how this lasts
and feedback with you guys
okay so we are back and now it is
currently 6:30 I'm tired I have places
to go but this is how we are looking
from Seoul said I have this little
pimple right here but it's okay and okay
review time so let's go ahead do a
breakdown who takes to me my mom okay so
the foundation I'm gonna go ahead and
insert a photo and also our nose text
because she was being honest
Wow this foundation is wearing
beautifully I definitely think that this
foundation is a beautiful foundation and
I do plan to use it because it just
looks really good it did not get all
oily around here it looks really good
the undertone of it it's almost too
orange for me because you can tell in
photos it just has a very yellowy vibe
and typically whenever I do take my
photos like for example I use my NARS
foundation in my 50 it doesn't have the
same sort of orange or yellow reaction
so I definitely think that if I do
continue to use it I may have to mix
them or just get another shade as a
different undertone that's not it's
orange on me cuz I mean I think it's
beautiful but yeah like I was taking
photos
it was definitely giving me some kind of
yellow orange little flash even without
the flash so that only happens when the
foundation is too yellow so that's my
only critique aside from that I think
it's wearing great I am getting a little
bit oily around the nose but honestly
I've seen my nose look worse like really
bad and I've seen my nose be on some
other stuff so I'm not too mad about
that now for the concealer the concealer
it was good as well I have no complaints
about the concealer and truth be told
more
about the concealer because it really
surprised me at first I thought okay
this must look crazy because it just it
looked too light for me it felt like it
wasn't gonna blend but it is good so I
am definitely pleased with that and I
love how golden it is I love how golden
that concealer is and I mean yeah I have
no complaints about that I'm not doing
any crazy and creasing crazy increasing
crazy creasing under there either so I
mean I think this is really good I'm
very impressed with both products so
they both get a yes for me but yeah
other than that that is it for this
little review of both products if you
guys want me to review any other
products let me know so I can go buy it
and get it and review it and do all my
good stuff but other than that thank you
guys so much for watching and I'll see
you guys in my next video peace out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
