so today's video you can tell by the
title is going to be a little review
slash tutorial using the new fin T
Beauty galaxy collection I got it this
morning and I was like a listen you
better get yourself home and film this
video for my people so that is what I
did and I created this look that you see
right here and I am here for it so if
you guys want to see it be sure to keep
on watching also be sure to subscribe to
my channel because I am very cool
okay we're not gonna get into a speech
because I can on why I need to be in a
million because I'm bomb but anywho if
you guys want to see the video then just
keep on watching and I hope you guys
enjoy it let's go ahead and get started
and yeah let's go let's go cuz my
editing is fire okay let's go you guys
let's get started whichever way is gonna
go okay before we get started on the
makeup I want to break down what's in
this collection this is the galaxy
eyeshadow palette it has 14 shadows and
none of them are matte as you can see
I'm gonna go ahead and swatch them for
you guys and just yeah just see that's
to see the colors and I just want to do
some swatching because I never really do
live swatching so I want to live swatch
these for you guys to show you guys the
quality of them and how they're really
nice and creamy so I live for that and
it's pretty nice little color variety
and they're all very different I found
when working with them next we have the
cosmic gloss lip glitters and oh I live
I love love love these and here's what
these look like
and I'll swatch them later on in the
video you guys will see and then next we
have these starlet hyper glitz lipstick
i swatched these later on as well but
here they are on my arm and then next we
have the eclipse two and one a glitter
release eyeliner and in this watch I did
not release the glitter I just kind of
left them as is I should have released
the glitter I know and then lastly we
have the galaxy 2 wait eyes shadow brush
and that is it for the collection okay
so as you guys can see I already have
one eye halfway done and the reason
being is because whenever I pressure
myself to get on camera and just kinda
like Vanessa look
I just don't really sometimes I just
don't know so I want to know so I can
execute and slay so I did it off camera
so let's go ahead and get started on the
other eye
as you guys can see I have my brows in
my forehead foundation on I do not have
foundation under here we're gonna do
that on camera because I want to give
you guys a whole look and also because
I'm using blue eye shadow and yeah blue
you gotta kind of work with the blue
first before putting off foundation I've
learned so let's go ahead and get
started okay so I'm gonna first take my
NARS radiant creamy concealer and I'm
using this as a primer just because
that's why down this side so we got to
come and match it up and I was going to
blank out my eye my eye arises
Cinderella cinderelly
okay now I'm also gonna set it with some
powder just a light layer now for the
eye shadow I'm going to take about two
matte shades and the rest will be
shimmer I'm gonna take a Sephora Pro
palette this is the colorful one
editorial and we're gonna use two blues
in this palette we're using this light
blue and this really nice pretty blue
boo I'm gonna take the light blue first
and I'm just going to start packing it
on to the eye so I'm just taking the
nice blending brush to do this next I'm
taking that dark blue blue and we're
gonna pop that right on top only focus
on the outer corner and see how I'm
getting blue underneath that's why you
don't want to do the foundation first
because blue it's just most colors where
you know it's a little tricky and I feel
like when you get blue underneath your
eyes like if you rub it it kind of makes
you look kind of like not good
underneath like there's other colors
where you can use it that you know you
can wipe it away and it looks okay
because it's not gonna like it's hard to
explain but do you guys know how people
cut correct on their eyes and they're
usually color correcting blue and purple
tints you don't want to just add those
back with shadow now so it just doesn't
look the most flattering so I definitely
recommend doing your foundation after
the blue okay so we're gonna take the 50
Beauty galaxy eyeshadow palette which is
the star of the show and I really like
this palette actually I think you could
do a bunch of looks with it now I know
some people are really intimidated by
shimmers more specifically all shimmer
palettes however if you kind of think
about it I think that it's kind of cool
to have an awesome or palette because
most of us already have a lot of matte
eyeshadows or transition shades that we
already own so to have an Austin my
palette you can just really get creative
with it and just add these on to any
other look that you do do you know matte
eyeshadows with like I'm doing now so
I'm not I think is kind of cool to have
an awesome or palette because you don't
really see many of them where we're kind
of seeing them more and more now because
I think that companies they already know
we have a bunch of matte so they want to
give us some shimmer life you know what
I mean
okay so now I'm gonna take some mixing
medium this is kind of important because
as a hooded eye person if I don't use it
it will not be that great so you want to
use some sort of base sort of sticky
base and this is perfect for me and I
want to say Mac discontinued this so you
can get it from NYX it's called the
multitasker mixing medium same exact
thing I puts them on the back of my hand
and now I'm gonna go ahead and take my
finger and I'm going to Pat it on the
lid first we're gonna work in sections
and I'm taking that blue shade in the
palette that nice true blue and I'm
gonna pack it right on top okay so we
have it on the lid and now we're gonna
go ahead and work into this area because
like I said we're doing an awesome run
look so I'm taking a little bit more
mixing medium and then packing that blue
right on top
now you want to go ahead and wipe your
finger because we're using a lighter
blue and you don't want them to mix okay
okay class I'm going to take more mixing
medium and I'm going to go into this
inner corner right here and I'm gonna
take the lighter blue in the palette and
just pack it on oh it's beautiful yes
yes and then we're taking a little more
mixing medium when I say a little I mean
I'm just getting on the finger but
nothing too thick a really thin layer
okay and I'm going to pack a little bit
more on just a little bit and I'm taking
that kind of right shade in the palette
with comic blue reflex it seems like and
I'm gonna take this in the inner inner
corner in the hood and they're all up in
there I'm gonna go ahead and take my
pinky and go into my flappy fold area
right there with more mixing medium and
taking that white shade and I'm gonna
pop it right there now I'm going to go
ahead and take the two and one at
glitter release eyeliner and this is
alien bay and I'm just going to quickly
line my my
while that dries my going and take a
makeup wipe and just clean up underneath
the eye and I'm gonna go ahead and pop
on my lash this is the clay beauty and
the style lucky now to work on the rest
of the face before we finish off the eye
I'm gonna take these into Beauty Pro
filter primer just to prime my skin then
I'm taking the pro filter foundation I'm
mixing two shades because I'm tan and
I'm going to use four foundations I'm
mixing the shades 410 and 370 to get my
shade
next to highlight I'm taking the thin
TBT matchsticks and I'm taking the
shades honey and caramel and that's
because caramel is more of a toned-down
highlight and honey will give me more of
a highlight I may actually just use
caramel it really just depends on how
I'm feeling
am I gonna be extra and my mind
addiction we don't know where we're
gonna be
let's put caramel on first memory go
ahead and set it in place
now from the under eye I went ahead and
put some powder so we don't get any
fallout I'm gonna go ahead and take a
pencil brush and I'm going back into the
Sephora editorial palette and we're
gonna pop on the blue all underneath and
I'm using the darker blue and I'm gonna
go ahead and pop on some mixing medium
and I'm gonna go ahead and take this
shade and the palette I'm gonna just
pack it on and I want to do that just to
switch it up because at first how does I
do all blue and I was a glisten
you're cool with matte so you can do you
can do more colors next I go ahead and
contour a bit using deep into Beauty
match sticks in the shade truffle and
I'm taking my little elf brush I use the
last time the last 50 video and it's a
new one because I lost my old one I
don't think I'm gonna do this because
this is my favorite thing to do Aksum
gonna add some quick blush
and then looking at my eyeshadow I'm not
getting like heck of life I want heck of
life not just live on heck life so I'm
gonna go ahead and just tweak it a
little bit because I see what I want to
do I see my vision so I'm just gonna
pull up this blue a little bit or
basically just gonna pull up the
eyeshadow with the green to highlight
red and take this kilowatt freestyle
highlighter and this is in the shade
girl next door and cheek freak and I'm
ticking Chic freak and I'm gonna go
ahead and just pop a little bit on and
then for my lips I don't know what I
want to use yet but I want to show you
guys how all the lipsticks looks let's
go ahead and just knock up the lipstick
and the lip glosses so you guys can see
how they look on my lips
okay so those are all the lip colors as
you can see I kind of like took my pinky
and soften out my brows because I feel
like they're looking a little bit doing
tint and the eyes are so intense so I
just kinda have to check myself like
girl these brows are two modes but for
lip color I don't know I likes I like
kind of like along them with this look
so I really don't know what to do right
now I do not know let's figure it out
I'm gonna take the shade sky fly first
and pop that on I think I'm going to go
with you need me my name oh I wanna go
gal gal on the moon or spacesuit I maybe
I just do both you don't look at that oh
and a little bit of this
okay so here we have the finished look
one hand through on my jean jacket move
my big hoops woo these hoops are
freaking huge but you know what they say
the bigger the hoop the bigger the dream
so I got some big dreams okay so let's
go ahead and do a breakdown of all these
stuff we tried to do so the glitter
release eyeliners I cannot speak too
much on them I cannot hype them up I
can't put them down I can't really say
much because I did not really really
really utilize them to its potential
I didn't release the glitter I did use
it on my lash line and it worked just
fine and it was really smooth so I can
say that but I cannot say oh my gosh it
gave me life with the glitter because I
didn't release the glitter so we can do
some glitter releasing in another video
if you guys want to see that included
but I can't watch folks on these
shimmers in the palette and the palette
onto that I like the palette a lot I
feel like sometimes seeing a palette
with no matte eyeshadows can be
intimidating but if you kind of finesse
as you guys can see I use about two
other matte shadows that I have -
another palette you come up with a
really great look and I definitely like
the colors involved as well because it's
so different because usually around fall
winter time companies go in a more vampy
or Brown direction but this was so fun
and I think that's cool to have
something different a variety and just
something something look forward to you
know and in terms of the lip colors
those are honestly my favorites I love
the lipsticks and the lip glosses they
applied so pretty and the colors are
really pretty because again usually in
the fall winter everyone goes for like
nets and birdies and you know like just
I really Matt you guys know I'm
envisioning right now you know just look
up Matt inspo and you guys are fall in
Spohn you guys will see you know that
the Browns the deep Burgundy's and
there's not really much gloss involved
so I'm glad that glossy lips are like
this this is me
I love glossy lips I love glossy
lipsticks I just I love gloss so I mean
I'm pleased I'm pleased
so that is it for this video and those
are my little final thoughts
I like the collection a whole lot and I
cannot wait to see what finn TVD
releases next maybe they will release a
bunch of mats next we don't know I think
I'm gonna live for it either way because
it just seems like a lot of efforts
being put into the product and the
packaging and just it's just bomb you
know yeah there you have it that's it
for this video my hoops are making it
hard to move around oh my god if you
happen to recreate this look be sure to
tag me so I can see it because I like
seeing you guys sweet creations and that
is it for this video so yeah so yeah
well what kind of video would it be if I
did not say so yeah
thank you guys so much for watching and
I will see you guys in my next one
bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
