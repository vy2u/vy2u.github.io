finally have a new video for you if you
cannot tell my voice I am currently sick
and like the last two days I've just
been like in bed like just like feeling
like absolute crap and I was like you
know what today I just I have to get up
because you know I overall like
obviously uploading videos for you guys
and I was like you know what I'm not
gonna let this stop me even though my
voice sounds a little bit ugly it's okay
I hope you guys still accept me but
today's video is going to be on this
look that you see right here using the
new kilowatt foils by finta beauty and I
also used the new lip product and
everything like that I just want to use
things from the collection because you
guys have been waiting on it and yeah i
was just like better late than never I'm
a little bit late but uh here you have
it I created this look right here just
really nice and blushed and it's
definitely heavily inspired by some of
the looks that I've seen priscilla do
she has been killing it with these looks
I'm say okay like how like how are you
so good at creating looks so I decide to
pull inspo from one of the looks that
she actually did at the master class I
went to where they revealed the new
products so here you have it so you guys
want to see how I got this look then
just keep on watching and I hope you
guys enjoy the video also you can't tell
I am blonde again the curls will be back
however I just I need some roots because
yeah I look like a crazy mad scientist
with just like a platinum fro it looks
come crazy so yeah just a little yeah
isn't it something kind of like just
like sexy about a raspy voice or maybe
I'm just telling myself that so that I
can feel a little bit more cute but the
first thing I'm gonna do is take this P
Lewis eye base as you can see excuse me
I already have my base done only because
like man like even just do my base I was
just like damn I'm out of energy because
I'm so sick so I just save some time I'm
gonna take this P Lewis eye base I think
the same color this is rumor - there we
go I'm gonna take rumor 3 cuz rumor - is
kind of too light for me so if you have
a more pale complexion yeah this one
will work better for you but I mean
I'm like more like right here because I
still want like a bright base but not
nothing crazy you know like no nothing
cree-cree so I'm just gonna apply some
to my eyeballs and use this morphe e 27
just to blend in so before I apply any
killer waffles I do want to go ahead and
take a matte eyeshadow first because
when I was playing with them they look
good like just on their own but I
personally feel that it just it shapes
my eye shape better when I do a matte
first I don't know what's really weird
it's really weird how it works because I
feel like shimmer on a hooded lid it's
just so tricky to like manipulate so I
almost feel like putting them at first
it just it looks better okay just trust
me on this I'm going to take this cap on
Dee Beauty this is the 10 year
anniversary a Chanel palette and I'm
gonna take let's see I'm gonna take
probably these two shades right here and
this one probably just like a mixture of
all of them to create a really nice
transition in my crease area make sure
this I base is still nice and even and
then we're gonna take a mixture of all
three of those shades together and just
pack it on next and it was so hard to
choose a look because well from one I
feel like Priscilla she has been just
like showing so many good looks with
these cool off oils and it's just like
one instant I want to use what is a
sangria sunset and most of sunrise and
the other one I want to use this one is
poolside in seven day weekend because
she has just been like just serving
looks with both vibes it's been really
conflicting but I think to match the
background for background purposes I'm
gonna take most of sunrise and sangria
sunset alrighty let's do it
I don't know what I'm doing okay so I'm
gonna take a sangria sunset and we are
going to apply this in our crease
pull me out apart as you can see and
then I'm gonna take my Moses sunrise and
we're gonna pop this right in the inner
part of the eye just a little bit though
because I want the focus to be the same
crease as you can see I'm using the
exact same brush to apply the sankarea
sunset but what I'm doing is I'm dipping
into the product and I'm angling it so I
get the more flat side of the brush so I
get more pigmentation because obviously
I'm doing more fluffy it's kind of
spreading out the product and just make
it a little bit more diffused but now
I'm kind of packing it on because I want
that pop of pink then I'm gonna switch
over to a makeup shack at t61 brush and
I'm just gonna pop this underneath that
and then I'm gonna take another kilowatt
foil and this is poolside and I'm gonna
apply this to the outer part of the eye
and then to make sure that I still have
that pop ups and crius on set I'm gonna
just dip to the product and wet my brush
with some setting mist and then just go
into this little area to make sure that
it's poppin
next I'm gonna add some mascara now next
to really just kind of pull this look in
obviously I'm gonna use the kilowatt
oils for blushes and that is the cool
thing about them is that you can use
them on your eyes on your face on your
lips as well what I'm gonna do first is
I'm gonna apply a matte blush first as
the base to the kilowatt because I don't
know I just found that that looked I
like the way it looked just apply that
as the base and then I'm gonna apply
sangria sunset right on top see I don't
want to do this what kind of vibe I
think I'm psycho hmm I don't know kind
of a light layer so the focus is more on
the eyes
and then I want to figure out a way to
incorporate the other killer oil so I'm
gonna take let's see I want to take oh I
want to take mint in mojito and I'm
gonna pop in the inner corner and then
for my nose highlight I'm gonna take
sand castle and B and I'm gonna take my
mosa sunrise and I am gonna am I gonna
do that I think I am
let's see how am I gonna do that yes I'm
gonna apply to the brow bone
and then what color have I not used
because I think I've used one two three
four what am I missing
I think I'm missing seven-day weekend
seven-day weekend how can we incorporate
her let's see
Papa right here
the highlight the Cupid's bow - and then
before I jump to the lips I just want to
spray all this just to sink it into my
skin seems these was one time I finished
filming so I can go okay
my okay so I'm gonna take saucy
Mademoiselle I think that's I think
that's the one what I do I just a little
light later cuz I want the focus to be
these eyes and I'm gonna take some of
these iridescent lip Luminizer and this
one is in the shade bilingual see how I
kept the lip nice and just toned down so
the focus could beat these beautiful
eyes yes that's playing no no no no I
feel like this could be more blown out
like I'm being a weakling I'm gonna take
some more of that sangria sunset and I
am going to just kind of just drag it
out really honestly like let's get a
little bit more
okay so here you guys have my finished
look and I think I'm pretty sure I
successfully used every single shade of
the kilowatt foils which is my goal
because I first I was like down here and
do a bunch of different looks and then I
got sick and I was like wow okay like I
gotta give him something and honestly I
love how this look turned out and I'm so
excited about just taking photos
honestly because you guys know I love my
photos but that is it for this little
video I hope you guys enjoyed it and
yeah that's all I got to say Oh in terms
of a review on the product itself
obviously I mean I think it kind of
speaks for itself I feel like a lot of
people were definitely kind of like
scared when they first saw them because
you know they're definitely not like
what we're seeing like on every day from
a lot of brands like their vibrant their
different colors like there's just
different little undertones like a green
kind of highlighter like you know how's
it gonna work a blue Icee highlighter
has gonna work I feel like I like the
fact that they kind of go on a unique
route because I mean you're able to
create really beautiful looks with them
and honestly speaking I could have done
a much more toned down everyday look
even still using those same shades it's
just on how you apply it so you don't
have to you know get into the whole
blush look if you don't want to you can
just pop a little bit of that orange on
your eye and it'll work out so overall I
mean I was excited from the jump because
I don't get scared I do get scared but I
think none of that but overall I like
the products I like them a lot
the only thing I didn't use was this
right here this is the island bling of
two-in-one liquid eyes shimmer because I
just had so much going on my eyes but if
you guys want me to use this in a future
video let me know I can just pop it in
there but other than that that is it for
this video hope you guys enjoyed it and
like the look and I'll see you guys in
my next one he's up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
