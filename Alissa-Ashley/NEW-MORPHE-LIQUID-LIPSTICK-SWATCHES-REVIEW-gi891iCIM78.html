been chilling but I just I posted today
so if you haven't grabbed them yet now
is your chance to see the colors on wall
so and I also gave you guys a little
input on the quality and the formulas
and stuff like that and the fire but I
gave you guys little details my little
cool pop-ups my edits on the quality and
the reason why I cannot say like oh the
lipsticks are great but look at your bad
is because also had a different quality
to me so yeah you got to see the ones
that kind of gave me a little bit of
problems and struggles inside that and
you got to see the ones I was like oh
okay so I want you guys go ahead and
watch the videos to be really short
video you know just pretty simple just
yes to the color so I can be too much
talking but yeah that is it this blue is
killing it I think I like blue lips like

always hesitating crispy records is my
hottest liars

I'm going shall we okay so that's it for
all these watching that was what like 22
shades my lips
honestly surprisingly do not hurt the
formulas actually nice and comfortable
so it didn't it wasn't a pain to remove
them it didn't like you know you with my
lips
so actually nothing I'm relieved about
because yes what kind of hard you know
just wiping engine he is watching so I'm
glad that it wasn't too painful but
overall I think that the colors that
they you know released are pretty nice
I'll let you guys be the judge of that
some of the formulas were inconsistent
as you can tell my little pop ups some
see more creamy others seen more liquidy
it was very confusing but I just yes I
let you guys know which one for like you
know the good ones which ones kind of
fell a little bit short in terms of the
quality just being on cuz you guys but
over I think you're getting a pretty
good yeah the prehnite please you don't
hold some pretty nice I think you know
sounds good what do you guys think we
have a window but for the price point I
think they're great and you know is like
oh if you watch that you do not have to
I do not care with code use or if you
don't use the code I don't care but if
you want to I do have more feet code for
all things morphine so why not but I
hope you guys enjoyed this little swatch
video you guys want me to do any other
swatch video and put my lips through
some pain or let me know actually it's
not painful it's just like I'm leaving
