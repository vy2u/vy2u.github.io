so for today's video I went ahead and I
did this eyeshadow look and the contour
in the blush situation and the lips
using some new more food products and
you guys aren't really following morphe
on any other social medias they just
dropped a lot of fire stuff and I use me
pick it up and pick up the baby I use
the 39a the reason why I decided to use
this one out of all of them is because I
was getting the most requests to do the
39a if you guys want to see the other
palettes let me know like in another
video but today it's 39 ad and I create
this look using that palette and I use
the brushes from the 7-piece brush set
we're gonna go ahead and go through all
that do not worry but yeah that's a
breakdown of what I did today also I do
have a morphe code
I don't really push it too much like
even on the launch date I didn't post it
at all which I'm such a terrible filly
it honestly like I'm trash but I do have
a code here's the code it's out there if
you guys happen to want to buy the
palette after this video based on my
recommendation and yeah if you guys
don't know how codes work I get a
percentage of the sale so I mean hey if
I made you want to buy it then Abby why
not because it helps me a lot
it helps me produce these really awesome
videos with these awesome effects
because I invest a lot into my videos
how do you gotta explain that though
because you guys know that but if you're
new now you know but without further ado
let's just go ahead and get to this
video because I just talked hello much
and I'm gonna doing so let's go ahead
and get to the video I hope you guys
enjoy it before we get into the makeup I
want to show you guys the palette and
some swatches and the price and the name
so like you're informed here is the top
two rows of the palette I just went in
sloppily swatch it on my arm here are
the bottom two rows and then here is the
middle row of the palette so they're my
swatches and then I'm also gonna use the
bling it on seven piece brush set this
is all from their Holiday Collection and
yeah that is about it for what we're
using today that is new the first thing
we do is go ahead and take my color pop
no filter
cela and this is the shape tan and this
is a morphe b14 I'm gonna use this to
prime my eyeball that I need a bit on
the eye I'm gonna go ahead and just
blend this out I'm taking the slightest
amount of banana powder just setting in
place a little bit to make blending
easier next time I go ahead and take
this blending brush and I'm gonna take
the nice olive green in the palette and
pop it in my lid crease piece leave this
area right here I always get them mixed
up I don't know how you would think that
I was just kind of like no by default
from do tutorials so often but nope I do
not
then I'm going to go ahead and take that
color right in the center just to kind
of soften it out and I'm gonna go in
with that deeper shade of green in the
palette and pop that right close to the
crease and lid area next I'm gonna go
ahead and take my Mac mixing medium
eyeliner if you cannot get your hands on
this one and get the NYX multitasker mix
medium now go ahead and pop this on the
lid I'm gonna take that shimmery green
on the far right of the palate because
it's a nice olivey tone with some kind
of gold tones in it as well and I'm
gonna pop down the lid so a mixie medium
first and then dip it into that color
and then pack it on the lid I'm gonna go
ahead and take my morphe slate gel liner
and this Mac minor brush and pop on to
weave I said like it's so easy to really
it's not I gotta focus
so not got to talk for a second I got
folks on this wing cuz this one's not
fire so let's hope the same for the
other side
okay winged liner is popping now I'm
gonna go ahead and take the same liner
and I'm going to draw a little line
across my watch line next taking this
morphe g12 brush and I'll go ahead and
take the same olive green and pop it
right underneath and then see how
there's a really disastrous gap between
the black and the green I'm gonna take
the black eyeshadow in the palette and
pop it right in right in there to get
rid of that because ugly see
I'm gonna go ahead and pop on some
mascara this mascara is bomb
it's from Kiko Milano and this is their
let's see I'll just have mascara on it
it's fall 2.0 it's a Fall collection I'm
going to go to the store and stock up
because the wand it's so fire it gets
all the lashes and bottom ones too so
I'll go ahead and pop this on gonna go
ahead and pop up some lashes they don't
make that much of look like a huge
effect which is what I want because I
want to focus with the eye shadow so I
don't really know the name of these but
if I figure it out I'll let you guys
know I know they're Lily lashes I just
cannot remember cuz I just kinda like
dumped on my lash in the same place
which is a really bad really bad habit
now for the face I'm gonna go ahead and
take this shade right here to contour
let's see how that works out it may be a
little cool tone but we'll see
I mean conference will speak cool tone
they use they kind of go warm let's see
fire contour shade okay we know what
I'll be contour with for now mm-hmm it's
like perfect awesome
don't go D I'll contour Alyssa don't do
it but do it still don't see these
different brush for the nose I don't
ruin it and leave this brush for the
nose see how that works for the nose
took too much let's see I'm scared
always a mess on my nose contour and
layin I'm gonna go ahead and take let's
see why do we think oh gosh I took too
much of a bunch of that shade right in
the middle I want to see how I look for
a blush but I didn't mean to just go
boom and soften it out with another
brush you ever use on her blush
I love it a little middle section on the
pallet absolutely F been here for it
like okay I'm not gonna do I'm not gonna
overdo it but that's beautiful that's my
forehead you know it's so unnecessary
that's okay okay I'm sorry
Oh what next I'm gonna go ahead and I
don't know what to do next now if I
might so into that I'm here for that let
me close the palette now
oh here for it I'm here for it a lot
actually
okay for blush I'm gonna take a little
bit of color pops whisp I've kind of
been liking a matte face I love my glue
can I be mad mama inside global warming
now cuz I've been doing this
highlighting like we like make me mad
mama no okay I think the look is
breathing grab gonna take photos of me
cocky oh not coffee but like I'm gonna
be here for it like do you like take
photos and you're just like but they you
take photos you're just like like you
don't know me you know I mean it's gonna
be one of those things I'm like okay
it's really interesting because this
looks so pink in the bottle but then
it's kind of orange tone it tripped me
out because when I was originally
opening the box of all the stuff I was
like yeah I'm not whatever I already
have enough like pinky nudes but then
this shook me it's like an orange nude I
was like okay like you may be
good-looking make my beer we're gonna
beer supply it while I'm talking hello
much okay what supply
and then a plane was passing by being
hit allowed and interrupting but I added
this new Mac it is their twinkle twinkle
in liquid lip color and it's fire so I
just want to add it just because it's
real cute
and then lastly imma go ahead and take
this color pop setting spray this is
their Amber crystal setting spray and my
mom's calling me hello
it's a glue so then she says you know
okay as you guys can see I went ahead
and add two full freckles and I my mom
was talking to me you know what Lex you
tell me her her stuff so I could have
just saved mom when I call you back I
love the Bob but here you have the
finished look and I am super here for it
I'm glad that I added this gloss because
I feel like it wasn't a liquid lipstick
but it was the fact I didn't add a brown
liner that was kind of bringing an ashy
vibe to me I don't know how to describe
it but it just didn't look the best so
adding this orange it really just kind
of set everything off and now I feel
more confident and it comes together so
I'm really happy that I made that choice
but overall this palette is good I am
here for this palette and looking at the
palette now you can create so much you
can create a simple ground everyday look
you can just use it just for the middle
section alone because I think it looks
beautiful as a contour like this is my
new go-to contour shade this I'll
probably use to warm up my face like I
did today it's just like I'm like okay
it's so beautiful I really love that
freaking olive green I love it a lot I
mean this is a beautiful eye look and
then just like the overall like I'm just
really here for it and I don't know I
don't really have anything bad to say I
would say we had no I don't have
anything to say I don't have anything
bad to say I'll have to play with it to
see the other colors as well but from
what I'm getting so far is fire is fire
it's fire squiggle so that I mean that's
my input on the palette if you guys want
to see videos using the other palette so
they came out
let me know because I was thinking that
maybe I could do a video on my each
pallet cuz there's three of them I don't
know if you guys are like oh Alyssa we
don't want to see more more feed girl
you know we don't want to see it let me
know if you guys do want to see it and
I'll do that so but this fellas fire and
I'm kind of like I'm okay like time to
go take my fire photos so by blood I'm
really happy with the look and how it
turned out I hope you guys like it as
well if you guys happen to recreate the
look be sure to tag me if you happen to
get the thirty nine eight palette let me
know how you feel about it what looks
you're gonna create with it and all that
other good stuff and yeah that's about
it for this video hope you guys liked it
if you guys did be sure to give it a big
thumbs up and I'll see you guys in the
next one bye time you'll take my freakin
photos that look good bye you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
