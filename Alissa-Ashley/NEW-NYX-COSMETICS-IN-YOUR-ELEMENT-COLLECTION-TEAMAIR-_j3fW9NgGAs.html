so today's video is going to be a
tutorial a toot toot toot toot and I'm
going to be using the NYX element air
palette let's make a pair right here
there'd be something cool I'm just gonna
hold it this is the palette and NYX is
coming out with as you guys I'm sure
I've already seen on the social media
because everyone's like look I'm so cool
they are element palettes so there are
multiple elements I'll go ahead and give
each girl that's part of the campaign a
little pop-up and I was the air element
I am the face behind the air of them it
is not a collab this is not my product
and yeah a lot about collab
no I am just they chose to represent the
air palette because I guess I'm earring
cool but today I'm gonna be showing you
guys my look for the air palette as you
guys I'm sure I've already seen the
campaign photo boom boom
that's me you'll see the NYX doors it's
gonna be pretty awesome
I'm just so thinking for that
opportunity I'm going to recreate this
look for you guys so that you guys can
create a 2 if you happen to get the air
palette of your teen air hashtag team
air so yeah I don't want to talk too
much yeah we can go ahead and get to the
tutorial right now we can do it let's go
ahead and get into it let's go
okay so naturally I went ahead and
brought you guys in closely because
we're doing my look I'm gonna take the
NYX eyeshadow base this is number three
and I'll go ahead and pry my eye and
then from the elements air palette may
go ahead and take this shade right here
and I'm just taking that to flush over
the primer just to kind of set it in
place a little bit but not too much just
a little bit next I'm gonna go ahead and
take this light pink shade and I'm gonna
use it as a transition color
I'm then gonna go ahead and take that
really nice beautiful fiery pink shade
I'm gonna pop it right on top it's so
pretty in so pink and I just want to go
ahead and show you guys you're getting a
lot of pigment let me go ahead and show
you guys some real quick zoom into the
palette as you can see when I'm tapping
it there's not fallout
so you're getting a lot of pigment but
it's not super powdery so I'm doing this
over and over again I'm tapping it I'm
tapping it and you're not getting a lot
of you know a lot of what he call it
craziness so I'm still getting a lot of
pigment a lot of color payoff I'm not
getting a lot of fallout I'm nadiyah a
lot of fall from the actual palette
itself so you're getting extreme leave
nice pigment without a bunch of crumbly
nonsense so there is a way to get a lot
of pigment without making the eyeshadow
a little bit too powdery on a blending
brush I'm gonna go ahead and just kind
of manipulate the eyeshadow to be a
little bit more OOP just like that kind
of how like I have my look in the
campaign shot next imma go ahead take
the blue shade and I'm gonna pop that on
the outer part of the eye and as you can
see I'm going to apply the blue and it's
gonna kind of create a purpley mist on
play like cotton candy just on my
backdrop and that is what I'm aiming for
in the front my lid I'm going to take
the little peachy shade of the bottom
corner and I'm just gonna pop it right
there and now for the bottom four on the
I am I go ahead and take that bright
pink and just pop it all underneath and
then taking that same blue pop it on the
outer part as well just like the top
part I'm gonna go ahead and just go in
and do some detailing I'm gonna go ahead
and bring up this pink a little bit more
because looking at my campaign shock I
do raise it up a bit then taking that
peachy shade I'm go ahead and just use
that as soften it out just a little bit
taking the pink and adding on top of the
blue to kind of bring out more of a
purpley tint to it
and then for the lid the reason why I
kind of just flushed some pink over it
and kind of ditched the other original
freakin color is because I realize on
the campaign shot that sand shimmer
right there and I was like oh like
that's what I did it came back to me I
remembered it so I'm gonna go ahead and
put some NYX multi tasker mixing medium
on the inner part of my eye and I'm done
take that kind of shimmery pink and pop
it on my lid
I'm gonna go ahead and do a quick winged
liner
now go ahead and just pop on my left and
then here is the I look done I did do a
more intense lower lashline I don't know
I kind of like it very soft like this
because it's very nice and cotton candy
now go ahead and pawn a lip color and
finish off the look and then for
lipstick I went ahead and line my lips
with a brown pencil and now I'm gonna go
ahead and take glossy peach and that is
one of the three lipstick shades from
the air collection yeah make sure you
guys can see it and then I'm also gonna
layer matte rose on top which is another
lipstick apart the collection
all righty so here you guys have the
finished look hope you guys like it now

pallets as well as lipsticks from the
air collection to give away to you guys
