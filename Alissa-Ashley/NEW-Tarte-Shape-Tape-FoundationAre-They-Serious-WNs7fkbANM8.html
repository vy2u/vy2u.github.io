today's video is pretty anticipated
because this is a product that we have
been waiting for for quite some time if
you guys are familiar with my channel
you know that i religiously use the
Tarte shape tape concealer I think
that's a favorite amongst so many people
because we all love it and with the
success of their concealer I think they
realize hmm maybe we should give them a
foundation so they have created these
shaped a foundation and they sent me the
foundations here's what the packaging
looks like for the PR package in the Box
we have three of the mat shaped a
foundations and three of the hydrating
ones I assume they sent me the ones that
would match my shade the best and they
send me B brush a sponge it's called the
shaper contouring sponge this is coffee
paddle to perfection foundation brush
and they sent me three shape tape
concealers so for today's video I'm
going to go ahead and apply the
foundation on my face and let you guys
know my thoughts on the foundation so if
you guys want to see that and just keep
on watching I hope you guys enjoy it
here's what the wand looks like on D
foundation here we have medium tan honey
then we have tan sand which is my
concealer shade and we have deep honey I
know how to show you guys on my hand
so here the three shades they sent in
the hydrating foundation it looks like
I'm gonna have to mix two shades in
order to get a decent shade for me
because none of these will match me this
one looks very orange this months orange
as well they just none of our match
somebody go ahead and figure out what I
can do to get it to match to the best of
my ability and I think I'm gonna do
hydrating on this side and matte on this
side let's go ahead and do hydrating
like I mentioned tan sand is actually my
highlight shade we're gonna go ahead and
apply a little bit on this side of my
face and we're also going to apply
honey to mix in I'm gonna go ahead and
use the foundation brush they provide it
to blend this out
okay so here's what the sides looking
like I think mix them together gave me a
pretty decent match it's definitely on a
hydrating side because I can see the
sheen it's not full coverage because you
could still see my little mole that I
have right there but it's a decent
coverage and I think it looks okay not
to go ahead and put on the matte side so
we got our oh this is tan honey so this
is an even tan sand it's actually tan
honey that's on the matte side got tan
honey and we got deep honey we're gonna
go ahead and blend it out okay so here's
what this side is looking like I think
this side just seems a tad honestly they
both kind of seem a little bit orange
but this is what they're looking like in
terms of shock factor I'm not extremely
impressed like there's certain
foundations that I apply and wrap the
bat I am very excited about it both of
them just kind of seem very like okay
foundation I want to go ahead and apply
a secondary layer just to see if that
improves my impression on it so I'm
gonna go ahead and do that and I also
want to use the sponge to do this to see
if this one's any good
so I'm definitely not a fan of the
sponge I feel like it's extremely hard I
personally like the quickie blending
sponge that tart has available and I
talked about a lot here on my channel
this fund is no-go for me and the brush
I mean I personally don't really apply
my foundations with brushes to begin
with so I wasn't like a super fan of
that as well I will just stick to the
quickie blending sponge because that is
the sponge I like or a Beauty Blender or
the Penta Beauty sponge we're gonna go
ahead and apply the Tarte shape tape
concealer and this is mache tant's and
just to highlight our face now I'm gonna
go ahead and set everything on my banana
powder and my setting powders
and here we have it I think that it does
not look bad at all at first I was
getting a little bit scared because it
seemed like this shape tape it was just
much more I don't have to scribe it but
the foundation itself was a little more
orange in tint
so the shape tape just kind of seemed a
little bit crazy and a little bit wacky
looking at if I must say but after
setting it everything looks fine and
honestly I was prepared to do a ware
test with this foundation but I
legitimately don't to the point and here
is why there's no point of me sitting
here and doing a full on foundation
review and where it tests when in
actuality if I end up liking this
foundation it's going to be extremely
disappointing because of the fact that
the shade range is literally so limited
that my viewers as well as just women
around the world who watch me and men as
well they won't be able to wear it
because most likely more than likely
their shade is not provided I have to
mix two shades but the fact that they
are such a limited shade range for
people of color people with melanin is
just so disappointing and honestly I'm
shocked that Tarts would do this given
the fact that they knew that people were
extremely excited about this because we
all rave about their shape tape
concealer so much and I'm not gonna now
go on oh I hate shape tape concealer now
because that would be so not genuine but
at the same time I'm extremely
disappointed tart because you guys
should know better as a brand and you
should know that it is 2018 and it's
time to be more inclusive it is not that
hard to get into the lab and at least
try to make shades for deeper
complexions even if you may mess up a
little bit because granted the
foundation was a little bit orange so
there could be improvements the least
you can do is just try to write it and
then we give you our feedback and you go
and improve it based on that but at this
point it's a slap in the face because
you release saying shades let's go ahead
let's check out the show
name shall we fair stand fair neutral
fair light neutral light neutral lights
and light medium neutral light medium
honey medium honey medium sand medium
neutral medium tan honey tan honey deep
honey rich sand mahogany there's
literally three shades that could
possibly work for people with a deeper
complexion and every other single shade
is a light shade and even people who are
light have spoken out about the fact
that enough is enough and you guys need
to be more inclusive honestly speaking
while this foundation looks great it
feels really nice I cannot recommend it
because I just
I'm simply refusing to recommend a
product that isn't made for everyone
while we love you turret we do because
we get excited about your launches as
you can see we're all excited about the
foundation we love shape tape I love the
quickie blending sponge we love your
palettes we love your products but you
need to work on catering to everyone if
you're not gonna do it don't give us
some half-ass we throw in three
deep shades to claim your inclusive when
you're not and you know you're not and
you know that you can do better so we're
gonna hold you accountable not everyone
if you don't that's on you you can
recommend it kudos to you but I'm gonna
hold tart accountable and say that this
is not acceptable especially in this
time it's not acceptable at all and you
guys need to get back into a lab and
figure out what you're gonna do to make
everyone feel happy because it's no
inhale that you guys should launch a
product everyone's excited and then you
see the shade range and there's so many
people out there that are bummed out
because they're prepared to spend their
money their hard on money and give it to
you to get this product and there's no
product there for them so if you are
someone who was really looking forward
to hearing about how I felt about the
foundations in terms of beware and
everything I'm so sorry that I cannot do
that
for you I just simply don't feel it
right to thoroughly review something
that not all of my supporters can go out
and get and be excited about because
there's not a shape made for them and
I'm going to go ahead and do a full face
of some of my favorite brands who are
inclusive and who do think about a wide
range of people and actually cater to
everyone for prime area go ahead and
take the 50 beauty pro filter primer
for foundation I might go ahead and take
my 50 beauty pop filter foundation for
concealer I'm going to take my NARS
radiant creamy concealer and this in the
shade caramel to set that in place I'm
going take my makeup revolution banana
powder
and then for the rest of my face I'm
going to the laura mercier translucent
powder to bronze I'm going to take my
Too Faced dark chocolate Soleil bronzer
and while Too Faced was one of those
brands at one point in time we were very
frustrated because they did not offer a
wide a shade range I can respect them
for reaching us jackie ina to expand to
go deeper shade selection because
honestly a lot of these brands they may
not really know how to formulate these
deep shades but i can respect a brand
who reaches out to someone who has a
deeper complexion to try to make that
change and to try to offer a wider shade
selection because that just means
they're taking initiative to actually
make a change in their selection and
while they might have been naive at one
point in time they recognize the fact
that deeper shades do matter and they
recognize the fact that having a bigger
shade selection matters a lot so they
make that effort to at least try and
that's the matter respect and then for
blush I'm gonna take my NYX sweet cheeks
blush palette
I've gone ahead and done my brows
off-camera and I also add a little bit
of the bronze of to my eyes now I go
ahead and pop on some mascara and then
to add a little bit of a pop I'm gonna
add the coverfx
shimmer Biel and this in the shade and
moonstone next time I go ahead and take
the Bobbi Brown highlighting powder and
this is moon glow
and then lastly since this is a really
simple look I'm gonna go ahead and add
20 beauties gloss balm so here you guys
have the final look and it's not really
a look to slay it's more so a little
with the purpose because I just want to
go ahead and give some love to brands
that actually make an effort to you know
be inclusive and to show us that they
care about this being in this community
and that you know they they make an
effort you know to provide shades for
everyone and they may not always get it
right the first time but at least they
make the efforts to try to get it right
not just you know still throwing us
these products in 2018 where we're
looking my okay like where's the other
half of the shade range and they tell us
oh don't worry you add more later and
like no we are tired of being an
afterthought and my same we because
grants and I know I'm on the lighter
scale of you know black people or people
of color it still matters to me
cuz I'm affected by this because you
guys are my audience and I want my
audience to be happy I know there's
people out there who aren't darker than
me who you know like want to be included
as well and I feel for you and it's
frustrating for me as well so that's why
I say we because even though I may have
some ribs that have a shape for me if
they don't have them for you I'm still
going to get pissed off about it because
that's just not right to me so I hope
you guys took away something positive
from this video and I hope you guys
enjoyed it if you did be sure to give it
a big thumbs up and let me know if you
guys thoughts let's go ahead and spread
the love down there and let me know
other brands who are also inclusive and
who also make an effort and try to be
inclusive but other than that thank you
guys so much for watching my video and
I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
