welcome to another video because I am
uploading a lot today's video is going
to be a review on the new me grab it
imma grab the box cuz they said TP are
the new Urban Decay all all-nighter
concealer and it claims to be full
coverage 24-hour wear looks like you've
got nothing to hide so I'll be trying
this out today I do have someone to go
yes I have a life today I have someone
to go later I'm going to see Miguel so
I'm quite excited and right now it is
currently I'm showing you guys a time it
is currently yes I am on lock screen
still it is 10:30 and I figured any best
do I make up now to see to see how long
it will last so if you guys wanna see
how it lasts then just keep on watching
yeah
okay so first time I go ahead and just
prime my skin I'm just doing my face on
camera so you guys can just see what I'm
using like in conjunction with the
concealer apply my primer her foundation
today I'm taking my sin T Beauty
Foundation I mixed two shade and mix 370
and 410 so I'm going to shake them up
and that's gonna be my foundation for
today I'm in such a good mood I don't
know what where's my booty blender Oh
sweetie where are you
I'm gonna go ahead and take my tart
quickie blending sponge and blend that
in my hairline is kind of red because I
just please my hair so I'm had to go
over that I just want to let you guys
know what that was I put on hey let's
audition today whoa boy it's okay though
we can wipe some off it's okay but I use
a lot holy crap
oMG we got to like cheer it down a
little bit
can you blinds not Michael's window okay
so as you can see I have some foundation
in my hair but I'll be getting rid of
that later I don't want to focus on
right now because they'll bother me but
now to the concealer okay so now to the
concealer I'm gonna go ahead and let the
details on this concealer pop up because
I do not want to like say for example
oh there's 12 shades and really there's
11 because it's got driving me nuts and
I get it wrong so imma go ahead let you
guys know on the details on the screen
and also last night I did arms watch us
at each of the concealers with no flash
and flash to show you guys the colors
then they come in and I just have to say
it honestly like the shade range I was
kind of like what the hell like because
you go from late and then one dark shade
and companies always do that where they
kind of have like light/medium okay
here's like one dark shade maybe two and
I just cannot stand it I mean granted by
looking at them I'm sure that a lot of
people will be able to use them under
the eye in terms of like you know I'm
assuming they made it to conceal because
that's honestly what people use
concealer for to brighten so maybe it
will work out but upon swatching them
and seeing on my arm I was kind of like
my initial thought was what the heck is
this but we're gonna see how they wear
and we're gonna see how they do let's
see so I want to say I cannot even leave
what shade end up being the shade that I
want to go with let's see I want to say
it was coasters let's see
was it me him it was not medium medium
is way too bright
there was a medium dark warm I believe
it was that one yeah I think it was
medium dark warm because I want to say
medium dark neutral I feel like yeah
yeah it was definitely medium dark warm
so I'm gonna go ahead and use medium
dark warm to highlight and then let's
see there's also a dark one and dark
will go pretty good on me too for a
highlight but I'm gonna go ahead and
just DIC with medium dark warm because I
feel like this looks the closest to my
NARS concealers and I'm set based off of
that so let's go ahead and apply it
here's what it looks like let's see how
she does okay so how would I describe
the consistency um as you can see it's
pretty full coverage and that's just
without blending I don't know how to
describe it it's thicker then um it's
thicker than NARS radiant creamy
concealer try and think or dose thicker
than Tarte shape tape it's hard to
describe it but it's definitely more on
the kind like creamy thick side not the
liquidy creamy side that makes any sense
at all so this is what it's looking like
and each side took about two dips for me
to be satisfied now obviously like not
everyone's gonna want a lot of concealer
but I like to have some nice concealer
so I do two dips so it took two dips for
me be satisfied let me go ahead and
blend this out okay foreheads blending
out nicely okay now to the under eye
area
so far so freaking good cool okay that
looks pretty good to me let's go ahead
and put on the eye okay so so far it is
looking pretty good now we have to set
it and I think I'm gonna use a different
setting powder that I normally do
actually no I should just stick to like
what I use because I'm trying to see how
it fits to my routine because I want to
try out this beauty bakery flower
setting powder because I always everyone
use it and I forgot that I actually have
it but we'll use that in another video
let me know if you guys want a video on
that powder I'm gonna go ahead and take
my makeup revolution powder and set this
in place
okay so I'm done setting everything as
you see I went ahead and set the rest of
my face as well I'm gonna go ahead and
finish off the rest of my facepalm some
brows all that good stuff and I'll be
right back
okay so I went ahead and put on the rest
of my face and this will be in the
tutorial for you guys because I filmed
this cuz I'm on a roll go into a little
concert tonight so we're gonna see we're
gonna see how it lasts and I'll let you
guys know that in the night
alright come back to the studio you
might probably be tired and we're gonna
see how it keeps up I'm pretty excited
cuz it looks really good it's flowing
really well with the rest of my face
it's not looking ashy on me which I did
have an issue with the naked concealer
lookin ass yummy which is why you guys
never even seen it on my channel so I'm
quite excited so we're gonna see how it
lasts and I'll see you guys in a couple
hours
Tim I just realized that like I have to
end my video little that block I'm in a
weird test on the early car the Urban
Decay
oh I'm missing my quickly no my memory
card board so this iPod is that be so
bad
he hasn't he but I might have on the
record for my sound quality but I see a
change that I shot a little bit I didn't
want to go to Schumer tonight but the
consumer held up pretty well as you see
my nose area kinda oily but that it's
not concealer but this part I mean it's
still nice and dry the time right now is
the time right now it is full 15 so I
mean what I put it on like what 10:00 in
the morning I would say that I mean it
looks pretty damn good to be on that
long you know so there you have it this
is such a fun way to in the video oh my
gosh it sounds like so bad let's try and
traffic back there but I just I was a
cup of and all these were in the
studios because I didn't have any
tissues in my apartment so I come over
here and I was like wait after got to in
my video so I mean I'm sure that knowing
me up right out of my little pop-up my
final thoughts of the product because

other reviews or wear tests let me know
