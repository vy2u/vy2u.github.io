if you are new welcome because I am
getting a lot of new people hello how
are you doing I am Melissa and that's it
for today's video I'm going to try out
the new makeup revolution concealer and
I've been seeing a lot of people compare
this to the Tarte shake taste concealer
and since that's cancelled we're gonna
hope for the best because this could
possibly be a winner and I mean what if
we love then we could buy that it's also
more affordable so it's just a win-win
situation and they have a nice little
range that I'll talk about later so if
you guys want to see me get down with
this review then just keep on watching
and I'll be guys enjoy it
okay so imma go ahead and pull up the
photo that I'm looking at here on my
phone so we can discuss the shade range
because obviously that's something
that's important to me
so what I'm talking like that so there
are 18 shades as you guys can see I
would consider this to be a pretty
decent shade range considering the fact
that this is the launch of the
concealers they didn't just launch five
shades and all right okay let's just
kind of wait and add more they came
we're off the bag with 18 shades I can
respect that
especially for a brand that isn't a
luxury brand I like that a lot
they're affordable that's another good
thing but also I want to talk a little
more about the shades a little bit if
you look through c1 through C 9 those
are my kind of like more on the lighter
side kind of creeping into medium and
then C 10 through C 18 those are more on
the kind of medium tan is deep side and
they go really deep with C 18 because
obviously speaking we're not using
concealers to actually like I don't
think anyone actually conceals like that
we use to highlight so I know C 18 I
mean that can highlight someone that has
a really really really really really
really really really deep complexion and
you can even conceal with it if you need
to so I actually like the shade range a
lot and I actually got the shade C 10
and C 12 so you guys to see how they
look on me or I'll just swatch them and
decide which what I'm gonna use but I
think that for them to just be coming
out with this product and have these
shades already available they're okay on
my foot I like to make it revolution for
that so let's go ahead and stop
talking and get to applying it I'm gonna
go in with the Finn T Beauty Pro filter
primer to prime my face and then a pro
foundation I want to wear something that
is super super super long wearing and
it's kind of like known for its long
wear so I'm gonna take the Lancome tani
Dole Foundation and I am in oh it's
Tommy dull ultra 24-hour makeup just in
case you go and look for it
you're like Alyssa where is talky dull
this is the full name for it and I am in
the shade 460 suede I want to say that
this one may be my summer shade just
he's a bit too dark so we may have to
add in another foundation because I
definitely got this at the summer time
and I'm now kind of a little more later
than I would be in the summer which I
want summer to come back because I enjoy
being tan I love me Dan and definitely
the summer to you know I'm gonna make
sense on my fintan UD foundation this in
the shade 370 just to lighten this up a
bit because I gotta be realistic I
recognize that I'm not tan anymore right
now let me go ahead just mix them in
Foundation is on so now I'm going to go
ahead and get into these concealers I
got two shades and I was just trying to
kind of space it out because I know that
not every single shade goes in like an
order of like from light to dark usually
but usually they kind of mix it up with
the undertones and I just felt like ten
and twelve they were giving you our best
bet in terms of undertone so this is
number ten we're going to show you guys
well let me show you guys the wand oh my
god I'm terrible with this okay so
here's the packaging here is the
packaging and here's the wand I go to
show you guys the shades I think I'm in
a using C twelve because C ten is a
little bit more on the pinky on your
tone and C twelve seems to be more my
shade that seems to be more of the
yellow undertone to go ahead and show
you guys so here you have it C 12
definitely seems more suitable for me so
I'm gonna go ahead and use that one then
go ahead and apply it let's see how she
applies okay oh so far it feels really
good it's just like boom I'm concealer
thank you for inviting me onto your face
how can I see you today I'm gonna show
oh it's going to blend it out okay like
that match I like this color for my
highlight cool
okay so far so good the way I would
describe it is that it seems to be a
really nice coverage without like drying
down and being like matte which
sometimes if a concealer is too matte it
could get really drying throughout the
day and at the end you have those kind
of like dry marks I feel like that won't
do that because it does look very
hydrating but it's almost like I don't I
described it to me something sailors are
almost too hydrated to the point where
they slip around like madness and this
doesn't feel it that way it feels like
right in the middle and I hope that it
is because that would make for an
amazing concealer so now let's go ahead
and stop talking and apply our make a
revolution banana powder which I use to
sit my concealer I like to use this
power to set like basically this part of
my face because I tend to get a little
dark around here while using a banana
powder kind of brightens that area so
that doesn't happen
and if you're new to my channel the way
that I like to finish off my face in
terms of powders I'll just take the
Sephora microcement powder and the
shaytan and my beloved more of the e58
brush and i like to buff over everything
okay so everything is looking really
good so far I'm gonna just go ahead make
some little points I like the fact that
I don't look at Chi because some
concealers tend to have a really gray
kind of just not really cute cool
undertone and they make me look great
I'm not getting that at all so excited
it's not creasing it looks really nice
and smooth it doesn't look cakey it
doesn't feel cakey and I mean overall
I'm quite excited I'm gonna go ahead and
do the rest of my face off-camera and
not be right back with you guys okay so
I am back and when I first said I'll be
right back with you guys I finished the
makeup it was 10:30 it's now 11:30
that's how long I take because I just
get in the zone I'm just like oh the
brows let me do that but I'm gonna go
ahead and do my baby do what I do Franco
lunch all that kind of stuff and I'm
just gonna just see how this wears
throughout the day I'm gonna come back
at about 3:30 I'm timing it to be at
least five hours of wear because I want
to get this video up at a decent time
for you guys if I come back around 3:30
ish maybe four that'll be enough time
for me to see how it's going to wear
because that's what this is a typical
day that people have on their makeup
yeah maybe eight hours but you get the
point we're gonna see how this lasts so
I'm gonna go ahead and just enjoy my day
and I'll be back with you guys to see
how they kept up held oh oh I would have
hated if I edit that guy's size it kept
him like no it's held up okay I'm gonna
see how it holds up okay so I am back it
is now three thirteen may cover up my
messages is three thirteen
and here's what we're looking like I
think that I've had it on for enough
time to give you guys input on it
because I put it on around like 10 20 30
ish in that range
I think it's been enough time for me to
give my opinion on it
okay so right off the bat I really liked
it I liked the application like the wand
and I love the color because like I
mentioned earlier it wasn't gray or just
anything weird funky because sometimes I
do come across concealer that are great
or just a really really weird undertone
that just does not make me look good I
also like the fact that it's not drying
underneath the eye because sometimes
like when my concealers get dry I just
get the line right here like it just
kind of like it just does not go well
and I just not have that so that is
great the only thing I would say is that
around the nose area because I do blend
my concealer over here it is oily that's
what I would say but let's just go ahead
and show you guys how easy that is I
wish I had my I do have it do I have
that I can't find if I was gonna say to
use the Penta beauty and vism act and
that's just a little blotting powder but
I'm setting a setting powder this is
Dolores yay I just packed up pack pack
pack and now I look like how I looked
pretty much my first started so it's not
terrible for it to get oily right there
because that is naturally where I get
oily and it's pretty sunny today with
Kathy bucks I love the Sun but that's
the only thing I would say is that I did
see oil build up around my nose so it's
nothing a little blotting powder can you
know get rid of but it is something to
be mindful of that it did get oily in
that area but aside from that the under
eye is what I'm most concerned about and
the under eye looks great it feels great
it doesn't feel dry it doesn't feel
heavy like I mentioned and it's not yeah
it's not moving it's not crazy or
anything because sometimes I'm use
concealers where I literally get like
and the lines I'm just like what are you
doing
I'm glad that it looks good so overall I
would say that this concealer is a
pretty good concealer to only be seven
dollars and I highly recommend trying it
especially in the fact they'd come out
with a pretty nice little shape range so
I mean I'm pretty impressed I'm pretty
happy obviously we're gonna use it
continuously and like I mentioned since
we're looking for new concealers to
replace my favorite Tarte shape tape
that I mentioned literally a couple
videos ago which is so crazy and now I
kind of have to stop supporting that I'm
gonna actively look for new concealers I
can recommend to you guys
so we're definitely gonna use this often
just to kind of get into the groove of
our routine by our I mean my to see you
know just how it's keeping up with the
gang with the rest of my stuff and we're
just gonna see how it goes but so far so
good and I approve and I I think you
guys should try it out because I mean
it's pretty affordable and I look good
don't I thank you other than that hope
you guys enjoyed this video and you guys
did be sure to give it a big thumbs up
and I will see you guys in my next one
peace it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
