so in today's video I will be reviewing
and doing a tutorial on this look that
you see right here using a the new
morphe 35o 2 palette and everyone's so
excited about it I did a Twitter poll
and you guys really want to see this so
I got it done
and I am so loving this look I'm so here
for it I'm so here for the read I won't
sing here gasp myself I think I did a
great job so I'm gonna go ahead and show
you guys how I get it and I'm also gonna
go ahead and let you guys know my
thoughts on the palette because that's
important because you guys want to know
if it's worth the fight and yeah I mean
that's just a breakdown that's what
we're gonna do so if you guys want to
see that be sure to keep on watching and
if you guys are not subscribed already
be sure to do that because why are you
not subscribed let's go ahead and get
that done right now Before we jump into
the tutorial
you guys probably why I subscribe to
your rambling ELISA because I'm cool
okay wanna see how I got the look to
just keep on watching and I hope you
guys like it okay so the first thing I'm
going to do is prime my lid now today I
kind of experiment a little bit little
low-key and I use my face primer as my
eyelid primer I only did excels to
ladies define eyelid primer honestly but
it worked it's a concept and this does
sis League primer I know it's quite
expensive but my theory is you can use
any primer that has like a sticky kind
of clear sort of vibe going on and it
will work but you guys will see what I
mean it imports out I don't know it's I
like it I think I'm starting doing it
now so we go ahead and just apply this
to my eyeball use my broken nail finger
to blend this in and I'm just gonna Pat
it in it was a concept and now we're
gonna take our morphe 35o two and i just
knit and I glued the little plastic
thingy with all the names on it on here
it looks really bad because I use nail
glue but they that's like all I had
as long another colors to tell you guys
what I use that's what counts right so
I'm gonna take the shade
Universal it's right here right there
and that's gonna be my transition color
and I did this on camera because I
didn't really know what I was gonna do
and I'm speaking if I was I just got on
camera and did a look at probably just
been a brown smokey eye so I want to sit
down at my vanity and figure out a
concept and that is what I did I like it
okay let's do it I'm gonna take the
shade Universal and this is a morphe r35
and get this lint off of it oh I swear I
like I want it all hardwood floors when
looking for my apartment but I notice
that Lake you get dust everywhere with
hardwood so lesson learned
oh it makes you gotta see any for my
second camera let's go over there
because it's close up yes I sold energy
okay second camera and I think they
caught this Universal because as you can
see I just put it on and where did it go
I feel like this is kind of like one of
those shades where I'll use it later on
because I use on this side later on or
not you'll see let me just let me just
do my thing okay I'm gonna take these
shade let's see what you that is that is
a blaze and it is a orange color and I'm
gonna take the same brush and I'm just
gonna pack this on Tina pack on the
orange and as you can see when I get to
this side right here I'm kind of like
pushing it to my brow a little bit come
go for this like nice little editorial
look or whatever and on top of that I'm
gonna take these shade fire which is
that nice beautiful red and I'm gonna
place that right on top I'm not gonna do
that too intensely just yet as you can
see I have a really intense right here
but you guys will see the trick I use to
do that okay so next I'm going to take
the shade rich and that is a deep brown
and I'm only taking a little bit of this
and the reason why I'm sticking with the
same brush because I don't really need
this color to be too intense if I wanted
more intensity I would take a smaller
brush I have but I kind of want to be
just really diffused which is what I'm
sticking with the same fluffy blending
brush cuz we don't want a lot of like
intensity I want that tends to be the
red and you gotta see how I do
in just a few it's just a little bit
down in a corner or outer corner inner
corner fool outer corner next I'm going
back into the shade Universal and I'm
going to sweep this across over here and
this is why I think it's called
Universal because it just kind of
diffuses your eyeshadow a bit so if you
feel like it's too intense or you need
to kind of like make the blend more
seamless you could take that shade and
just sweep it over and as you can see it
just softened it up a bit so I get why
the name Universal next I'm taking a
little bit of tart shape tape I'm taking
this morphe brush right here and this
was a part of the little bedazzled
collection I'm not sure if it's doing
the site but any small concealer brush
will do and I'm going to carve out my
lid in just a little bit of concealer
don't take too much because I just
cannot see that going well just take a
little bit and then I cannot look up
because I do know I mess it up but I'm
going to take the shade sauce and that's
that shimmery orange and I'm going to
pack that directly on top next I'm
taking a little bit of tart shape tape
and I'm taking it on this brush and
that's why it's getting red on it cuz it
has red on it I'm just taking a little
bit of shape tape just to kind of make
the eye shadow and here because I liked
how that happened on this eye and I'm
taking the orange shade that I took
ablaze I'm gonna pop underneath
and this say morphe import 3-1 brush but
any pencil brush will do that you have
and I'm going to go ahead and take the
red shadow and just pop that right on
top and I'm going to go ahead and take
these shade rich in the surround and I'm
going to put a little bit on the outer
corner now to work on this red to gives
you really pop lock and drop it
rig it to pop more I'm going to take
this morphe setting spray I'm taking
this dose of colors blending brush and
I'm going to dip into the red I'm not
really time just like pack it on the
brush open my setting spray I'm gonna
spray the brush very lightly just a
little bit let it kind of air dry a
little bit cuz you don't want to get
directly onto the eye because you may
mess up your shadow
let it air dry and then I'm going to
pack it on
they get one more little round okay I
watch me really intense and I'm gonna go
ahead and switch over to this brush and
just kind of sweep over everything make
sure it's nice and blended
then taking on more PE 49 I'm just gonna
go ahead and Pat underneath just to give
it any sort of fallout you not want that
and that is basically the eyeshadow done
I may go in and add some more red it
really just depends on what I'm feeling
like but now I'm gonna go ahead a pop on
some mascara now for blush I'm taking
this busy art pallet and I want to take
like these little shades over here like
the more orangey ones just put a light
layer I'm gonna go ahead and highlight
my Cupid's bow I'm taking this laura
geller diamond dust and I go ahead and
pop that right there awesome my nose a
little bit wonder on this will look
let's see
took a little too much off upon further
investigation so I'm gonna take my
finger and throw it in and I'm go ahead
and take some Finn T beauty gloss balm
and pop it on top okay so here you have
the finished look and yeah yeah okay
wait you can see that I'm trying get
some shoulder fun sexy okay yeah okay so
here we have the finished look and
overall my thoughts on the palette even
though I allowed them to pop up as I'm
going is that I love it it is definitely
a step up from the 35 Oh in my personal
pin peen it's definitely a step up in my
personal opinion and I definitely can
see that they went up with the quality
in terms of the blend ability the
smoothness of it the butteriness of it
it's definitely a better palette as a
whole which honestly we should expect
because I mean more feet they're making
a killing right now they got us
affiliates you know with our codes
making the coins for them so I would
expect a brand who's making that much
money to invest in their quality so I'm
just I don't know I'm proud of morphe
because they start a little bit small
and I feel like we should kind of we
should all be proud because they're
stepping up their quality and that's a
good thing because I mean honestly
speaking not every brand does that some
brands they get big and they lower the
quality because cheaper for them so I'm
glad that they're investing in
themselves in that way because you can
tell and the products that they're
putting out and you just gotta respect
that so I'm happy I'm happy with the
palette so hope you guys like the look
