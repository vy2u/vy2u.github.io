so today's look is going to be a nice
pretty simple but not so simple New
Year's Eve look it's really kind of
toned down very warm telling a little
bit of glitter nothing too dramatic by
the same time you still will look hot
and sexy so yeah it's kind of a
last-minute look because I didn't really
plan on filming this but I loved the way
it came out and you guys said you guys
wanted to see it so hope you guys enjoy
please do not forget to subscribe and
check the description bar for all
details and let's get started alright so
the first thing I'm gonna do is apply my
foundation I'm using this foundation
from Shea Moisture I don't know the
exact name because it's very new to me I
bought it from Target a couple weeks ago
but it's my first time really using it
on camera and I am loving this so as you
can see I switched from a Beauty Blender
to this brush from Julius place because
I feel like it's better applied with a
brush so I went ahead and switched that
just to kind of speed up the process and
make it easier for me so yeah it's gonna
blend that into my skin next I'm going
to be taking the LA girl Pro concealer
this is the shape pure beige and I
decide to kind of try to make this video
as affordable as possible you know kind
of not going so high in this time you
know for my people who are watching me
and you know they might not want to
spend sixty two dollars on a wise self
foundation you know nothing too extreme
so yeah I'm gonna use something let me
use things that are pretty affordable
first look I'm gonna go ahead and bloom
it in and stop talking for now yeah
and now for my contour I'm going to take
the Ruby kisses 3d face creator and my
Julia's place brush this one's great for
contouring and it came my set so I was
like okay let me try this out I really
liked it but of course I can't blend
everything out with it so I did switch
over to the flatter brush from Julia's
place just to buff that out so it look
nice and good and then as you can see my
contour is a little bit not so defined
so I ended up taking another concealer
and placing it underneath my contour
just to clean it up just a bit that's a
tip if you get your contour a little bit
too all over the place and now to work
on setting everything I found that with
this foundation it's not necessarily
matte but it's not super shiny either so
I didn't really have to bake anywhere or
add you know a lot of powder which I
really really enjoy it and I feel like
everything came out really nice and
flawless it's so hard to explain but I
feel like the combination of all the
products I'm using right now are really
bomb so I will definitely be reviewing
that foundation in the near future and
now I went ahead and took my Maybelline
fit me powder just to set the rest of my
face and then I'm going to place some
more sacha powder just to catch the
fallout and the reason I didn't use a
sponge is because like I said it's
already pretty matte I don't want
anything too crazy now for the brows I'm
taking this nyx gel brow stuff that you
guys are recommending to me and I
finally got my hands on it they were not
sold out so I'm so excited and it's my
first time using it which is why I kept
you know have it check to make sure I
was doing it right but this stuff is the
bomb the only complaint that I would
have is that I wish it was a little bit
more warmth to it but I fixed that later
other than that it's a really good
product so I was really really feeling
it
now to just concealed underneath my brow
by the way I was using a paint brush for
my brows I don't really know the brand
of it but I will try to write it down
it's pretty tiny so I'll let you guys
know in the description bar and then I
went ahead and just pry my eye with that
concealer and now onto the eyeshadow for
the eyeshadow everything will be listed
down below because I'm just so bad with
eyeshadow names but I primarily used
makeup geek I believe the first shade
was chickadee this one is cocoa bear and
the next one will be honest osseous
fudge I do remember that much Wow
I remembered cool but yes I primarily
use just these three shades so no need
to worry
and I switch between two brushes both
from morphe and they will be listed down
below and as you can see I'm just
building up that intensity getting nice
and warm and then I'm going to work on
the lid for the lid I'm taking the LA
girl gel glide pencil this is the brown
one and I placed that on the outer parts
of my eye and I'm just going to blend it
in with my finger and then take fudge on
top just so blends in with my crease
area and then I went ahead and popped on
some Mirage from makeup geek on my brow
bone to make that a little bit more
fleeky now for my inner part of the lid
I took some Mac makes a medium liner and
I'm taking this really pretty shade for
makeup geek called untamed and then I'm
gonna go ahead and do these same exact
things for my under eye I'm gonna take
the LA girl gel glide pencil and smudge
that in and I'm going to add some fudge
and then I'm gonna add some montane I
don't know why I'm get some tongue-tied
I don't know maybe I have too much
caffeine I'm not sure let me stop
talking for now
and now the eyeshadow is done I'm gonna
take some mascara this is benefit
they're real and before I apply my
bottom lash mascara I'm just gonna dust
away that powder because I had the fear
that if I dust it away afterwards I
would just smudge all that mascara and
ruin everything
and now I'm going to take the Koko
lashes in the style goddess and pop
those right on top and now as I
mentioned earlier I feel like the brows
were a little bit too cool toned and
lacking some warmth so I went ahead and
took that fudge I shot off from aa
Nastasia that I used on my eyes and I
placed that on my brows and I really
liked it I feel like it really kind of
was my hair color and it looked good so
I'll probably be doing this a lot more
often now and now that the brows are
done I'm gonna go ahead and take the LA
Colors contour kit I think it's called
the I love makeup contracted and I'm
just going to bronze up my face using a
dubious place brush I'm going to contour
my cheekbones and my forehead and for a
blush I'll be taking makeup geeks summer
fling because my favorite and I thought
it goes really really nice with warm
tones because it has a little peachy
undertone and I like it now for my
highlight I know it sounds a little more
affordable but I really really want to
try the on Saskia glow kit and this one
is the that glow kit and I switch
brushes as you can see because the fan
brush I picked on was a little bit too
soft and I wasn't really filling it so I
used a zoeva brush instead and I'm
highlighting the areas that I normally
highlight BAM now for lips I decide to
mix two lip colors together it was a
very random choice but I was feeling it
I took color pops Limbo first and then
on top of that I took color pops
Tooley as I pronounced it and it just
created this nice beautiful gorgeous
shade that I was in love with and I will
probably over wear it until you got a
sick of it
now since this is a New Year's Eve look
I feel it couldn't be won without
glitter so I took this gold glitter from
motives cosmetics
I'll have the name listed down below and
I went ahead and took some Mac mixing
medium liner so that it can adhere to
those areas and then I'm going to just
spray my face and this is very very
crucial because you want to makeup to
last all night and this one's from
Scandinavia and then our look is
complete and I really really loved it
I'm so happy that I went ahead and did a
look because yep I I needed to but I
hope you guys really really enjoyed this
video if you recreate it

hope you like it anyway other than that

will see you guys soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
