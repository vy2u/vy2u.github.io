probably look silly because honestly
have a beef face I have on hoops and a
onesie this is a onesie from Target but
I'm chilling today and today's B that's
gonna be like a favorites video and I'm
showing you guys products that I've been
using or liking because you guys like
when I do this kind of videos so if you
want to see what I've been liking I do a
check on my cat's gonna make a noise but
you wanted together like you keep on
watching what are you guys doing okay so
the first product on my list is this
Kiko Milano eyeshadow and this is number
208 and this has actually been known
about on the internet for a while now
because a lot of people are saying that
it's a dupe for Mac's whisper of guilt
now I've never owned whisper of guilt so
I don't know I don't know but it is
amazing I actually went to the Kiko
store ELISA if you're watching this
video what mall was that ellison in the
valley I was out in LA and we went in
the head Kiko stores I go wow so I got
the eye shadow but it wasn't this one it
was number 200 and she's oh yeah that's
the one it wasn't the one it was still
beautiful but it's more of a pink
undertone so if you have more of a pinky
undertone maybe get the number 200
I think it's 200 I'll confirm gone below
but this one is 208 and it's very golden
and it's so pretty let's put some more
on already have it on but it's so sheer
in the sense that it just kind of really
melts into your skin and I love that in
the highlighter it's not even a
highlighter it's my shadow so the fact
that it's pulling off that kind of
satisfaction and sexiness without even
being an actual highlighter it's doing
better than some highlighters on the
market that I've tried so I've all here
for it the next thing we talk about is a
subscription-based service and if you
guys are pretty familiar with my channel
you know that I love scent bird they are
a perfume subscription-based service and
for 1495 a month you get to pick a
designer fragrance of your choice based
on your profile and the survey they give
you and the creators of scent bird
actually created another
subscription-based service and this one
is from makeup and this is called a deck
of scar
okay look my fingerprints it is called
deck of scarlet and for 29.95 you get a
new palette every two months now this
palette isn't just eyes shadow you get
three eyeshadows to face products two
pencils as well as two lip shades and
they made it so that you're able to use
it for both day and night looks you can
easily turn your day look into a night
look using the brown pencil and the
green eye shadow for example so it's a
pretty versatile palette and you're able
to cream off looks overall it's a really
nice palette because you're able to get
multiple uses out of that one palette
and it comes with a mirror I feel like
any product that comes with a mirror
deserves an award I don't know why not
all products come with a mirror because
it needs a mirror and I like the fact
that it's just a nice well put together
palette as you can see you just open it
up please open it we're ready to go so
you definitely make sure to check them
out I'll have all of the additional
details that you may need to know as
well as links Kohl's all that good stuff
listed down below in my description bar
for the deck of scarlet subscription and
let's launch next month now the next
product I'm gonna talk about is my
Clinique take the day off balm and no
this is not sponsored i noticed that
like whenever i've seen in a video it is
kind of sponsored but this is kind of
one of those products that youtube made
me buy because i kept seeing it so i'm
just okay like it must be bombs i decide
to get it on my own and it is quite
amazing now with this kind of product i
have tried other things of this nature
where you you know melt makeup off and i
did not like it at all i thought it was
very oily and i just did not like that
my skin didn't feel clean afterwards
they kind of spoke you know just not
it's like there was still some stuff
lingering on my skin but with this one
it takes everything off as you can see i
use the way you can't see because my
life is so bright but i've used quite a
lot of it but it lasts a long time i've
had it for like over a month now it's
pretty cool like i actually
the fact that you to me by it because
it's really nice and whenever I do sort
of makeup looks that are really freaking
hard to get off I just use it I use this
because it literally melts off
everything so hey if you've been kind of
contemplating getting it and you're just
like oh my god like everyone keeps
shoving down my throat because you know
they're getting sponsored do it I'm here
telling you as a non sponsor person to
get in try it out if you been wide try
it out it looks cool because at first I
didn't want drying I'm like oh this is
sponsored and I'm okay
I want try it and I like it out so go
ahead go check out because I approve I
approve okay next product this is also
some skincare related stuff and this is
the dr. jart plus I think that's how you
pronounce it the dr. jart plus and this
is the serum midden I don't have
paralysis okay
I don't pronounce it but I was in
Sephora one day and I love trying new
skincare stuff that's just my thing
I just love skincare if you guys haven't
noticed I like using new stuff for my
skin and I was just kind of looking just
picking stuff up and then at Sephora
they had a little cool machine thing you
were able to scan it and see the reviews
right there so that's why I did and if
you have the app you can do that too
that's pretty easy for you but I saw
these and I was like holy crap the
reviews are insane if you're amazing
so a lot of people that got the liquid
cuz it comes a liquid and a cream but
you to buy them individually yeah but a
lot of people said they got the liquid
and the cream oops what I just move they
got the cream too and I'll even on the
instruction that says to apply the
liquid and then follow up with the cream
and man I have been using it you can
kind of see the cream is like on its
last life is all cracking and everything
because I have just been using it is so
good because it's so gentle on sensitive
skin so if you have sensitive skin
definitely try these because I mean had
to smell it again just confirm it
doesn't smell like there's any fragrance
in it whatsoever it just feels good like
I don't know what to say like it's just
a really really nice combo and I never
would have thought to buy it because I
don't really hear about this brand a lot
but I just went to Sephora and I just
kind of explore and it
me too these so I really like them I'm
definitely getting more of the cream I
wouldn't say that if you do buy them
you're gonna likely end up having more
liquid because this is like yeah a lot
less of this but I need more cream so
definitely keep that in mind it's
probably gonna be something that you had
to keep up with and buy more cream but
it's worth it
I like it I prove next thing on my list
this is the melody Mills Hollywood gleam
body radiance and this is from your
Deluxe's collab it's peach deluxe and I
haven't using the video yet
I know but Sarge is my friend and I'm
gonna support her and it's the bomb and
here is a little before and after shot
that I decide to show you guys on my arm
so here's before peach deluxe and here's
after peach looks so it gives you a nice
a nice subtle kind of glow it is very
peachy but not too peachy to the point
where you're feeling kind of pink it's
just perfect and I cannot wait to use it
as a base for my makeup I've been seeing
Sandra use Collini by Melanie Mills for
so long and she's always in the base and
she actually inspired me to use as a
base so I'm so proud of her for having
to collab with them because it's just so
genuine you ever see someone have a
collab and you're like that makes sense
because they're always using their
products and they really love it so it
is amazing happy to see someone collab
with something and creates something
from brand that they really love and
they are true to and all that good stuff
I'm just very happy for her if you can't
tell so definitely definitely support
Sondra because she's amazing it she's
such a cool person and this is the bomb
and she made it so that it is suitable
for all skin tone so that's awesome as
well when you do that for all the skin
tone peeps and all that stuff so
definitely give this a check out the
next thing we talk about is my Sephora
micro smooth powder now you guys have
seen me use this in every single video
as of late because it is the bomb now to
be honest a lot of times I've gone to
Sephora I don't really trust love the
girls and that's there's no shade I just
you know I do makeup on like myself so
I'm just like no like you know I'm kind
of stubborn in that way I'm like I don't
need to listen anyone like I know
stuff so I don't really listen to
recommendations a lot of time I like to
either just look at the reviews of
products or I just kind of just chance
it and just buy and just see and then I
recommend to you guys you know I'm kind
of like on that end but I went to
Sephora one day and she recommended this
and I frickin impressed this is amazing
and I was like Alyssa you're late I've
been using that I'm saying okay okay and
it is amazing I'm in a shape tan and I
use it to set my face and it gives me
such a flawless finish and I love the
fact that well it's a finishing powder
so obviously it's for finishing but I
like the fact that it's not super heavy
and pigmentation if that makes any sense
at all it's almost like a setting power
that's kind of translucent but still has
a tint to it so you're setting your face
and you're staying true to your color
that make sense I just love it it's not
too heavy it's not too thin it sets
perfectly and when I use anything else I
notice that I don't get that same
flawless airbrush results
that's with this one so I gotta give its
props you know good job Sephora for this
product I actually have two and not I
mention it I don't know my new one is
that to find it but we're able to worry
about the later we were a bit later okay
so but this is the bomb so definitely
try it out if you want to not it's okay
but it's giving me airbrush finish and
you guys see that on my videos so yeah
it's a secret
the next thing to talk about is the
cover FX natural finish foundation and
this is not new to my channel whatsoever
and I have actually raved about it
before I want to say it's probably
showing up in another favourites video
I'm pretty sure but I'm super excited
why I say like that like what I'm super
excited because this is my exact shade
it's my exact shade because at first I
was in the shade in 72 I'm like okay I'm
in 70 and I thought that the whole
frickin time and then went went to
Sephora I was like hmm hmm and I decided
to just go ahead and just apply makeup
whenever I go in there bare face it's
never a good thing because I'm just like
my own personal swatch system and I was
just trying a different shade and I was
like I was like what so I thought so in
sent me the whole time really I'm a
genie this is a perfect match to my skin
it's crazy perfect undertone everything
the n7t is a little bit too yellow now
that look back at it and I didn't really
know but this one is perfect so I just
want to go ahead and just throw that in
there give them a shout-out for even
having such a wide range of shades to
select from but this is amazing so I
just want to like yeah I'm excited I
thought my perfect shade I just want to
share that so yeah so that's that the
next product that I have on my little
list and this is like the second to last
one I know I'm talking a lot I just get
excited when I talk about products this
is called eco brow and you guys should
be kind of familiar with me mentioning
it because I've been using it in my
latest tutorials and it is so good it is
actually a wax it's not a pomade and I
like the fact that it's a wax because I
find that with waxy products they don't
dry out as easy as pomades
so actually I left it out overnight and
the top was off and I didn't even know
but it's not dry whatsoever and it's
lasted me quite a long time and I just
kind of did my little brush into it it
since waxy it's not picking up a lot of
product it's picking up just enough and
I do my brows and you guys have been
loving my brows lately and this is why
cuz this is amazing and oops I dropped
the cap this is my shade Rita and I like
the fact that it just it complements my
my eye look you know because hard to
find brow products that look good with
blonde hair
that don't look intense and I like how
this one looks other people may not like
it I don't know if you do or not but I
like it so it matches for me
it's not too warm it's not too cool it's
just right so I like this product a lot
Iike brow if you're watching this I'm
totally not opposed to you sending me
some more you know like I'm bring it to
me because I love it I don't live in LA
so I met to figure out how to order some
more because this is the bomb and the
last thing on my list before I lose my
voice because I could feel it going away
is clarity it's not even a makeup
product it is Claridon and this is their
non-drowsy 24 hour and the reason why
I'm mentioning this is because if you
guys follow me in my life you guys know
I adopted two kitties and they actually
sleep your sleep right behind me they
like being wherever I am I got them and
on the first day oh my god I was
breaking out so bad my whole face had
bumps it was Rashed
out if that's is Rashed a word know how
it was just jumbles and i was like oh my
god like I want to keep them you know
like I just I would've felt bad taking
them back to the shelter I'm like okay
now they know my home they're excited I
was like no I like so I'm either gonna
freakin just have to deal with the
breakouts every single day and it
affected my skin even though I need my
skin to film or I may have to get them
back I didn't want to so I looked up the
best you know method or whatever and I
also asked Twitter and a lot of people
said Claridon so I tried it and I
haven't had any allergy since then and I
was like hey I get to keep my babies
because I was so sad I was like oh my
god like oh my god but that saved me so
I have to take every single morning and
as long as I take it every single
morning I'm good to go so I just kind of
want to mention that because I know some
people may want a pet but they have
allergies so I'm just saying I mean you
can try it and you could try to clear it
if it works for you that's great because
I mean aside from having to take the
pill every single day and sometimes hard
to remember at least you get to have
your cuddly friends so I just want to
mention that but that is it for this
video and I hope you guys liked it and
you guys want to see any other like
little favorite products and all that
good stuff like always let me know if
you want to see anything else let me
know
other than that thank you guys so much
for watching and I'll talk to you guys
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
