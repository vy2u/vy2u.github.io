just woke from a nap actually I'm so
tired so if you can hear my voice my bad
I just yeah yeah I thought today was to
be super productive and I just completed
knock down the couch but today's video
is going to be a review and you guys
have probably seen about at least 10
videos of this dang thing already but I
was like you know what I have it I'm not
gonna let it go waste I want to review
it to to formulate my own opinion on it
and I avoid it watching anyone else's
video using it I want to be able to try
it firsthand
I'm so tired I want try first hand and
to let you guys know my thoughts
Evelynn slots of difference so this is
the silly sponge well this is the
packaging but this is the silly sponge
and I got the actual one I didn't get
the broad search um that's flat one they
sent too which is awesome and here is
one treegasm already see what looks like
and honestly when I first okay I guess
it's like a first impression as well
when I first I kind of grabbed it I was
like oh because to me it looks a little
more thin in pictures and I know to me
it was like a little bit thick here can
you guys focus on it camera focus on
sponge Oh top hooks to me it kind of had
more of like a little thickness to it
that I was not expecting so like hmm and
it feels so soft it goes off anyways
I've subtracted I'm gonna go ahead and
try this bad boy out where and get
straight to it and I wanna try it with
multiple foundations so you guys can see
how it works with different foundations
because it may work differently with a
cream foundation than it does with a
liquid you know I mean so I decided to
do that and if anyone else has done in
the video again I haven't watched you
watch this video because I want to give
an opinion so my bad so the first
foundation imma try is the cover FX g80
foundation and um I guess I'm just go
ahead and just dip into it I guess okay
so it's picking up on the sponge
go ahead and just apply it huh it's
actually not that bad
interesting I'm more during if people
tried it with the cream foundation goes
with a cream foundation it's pretty nice
Wow that's blending really nicely I'm
like shocked right now honestly because
I didn't know how it's gonna work
now I kind of had a feeling that it will
work really nice with a cream foundation
so just kind of my own little uh what do
you call professional what do you call
it my first thought but I'm like really
shocked at how easily it's blending and
it's getting all the product on my skin
and my skin doesn't look cakey at all it
looks very nice and it almost look like
a skin finish in my opinion it's not
taking that product on okay okay let's
do more cuz I'm a cakey person I'm
assuming that if you want to kind of get
more coverage you can I just had to pack
the foundation off first and then it
come like Pat it in when I rub it in it
gives a nice natural finish okay okay
this is actually kind of cool it's kind
of cool all right can begin to that nose
area squeeze into that the sound it
makes is kind of weird but I kind of
like this this is actually karmic this
is actually pretty cool this is pretty
cool I'm like I'm like impressed right
now because I know whenever like well I
didn't watch any YouTube videos but I
did see like little Instagram clips
obviously that's why decide to get it
because you guys were like sim to me
it's Cena it was hard to move around
with a local foundation but with the
cream you guys are kind of seeing a
first hand it looks really nice with the
cream so the Korea foundation worked
well and I'll go ahead and try another
one put a little bit on it interesting
let's see this side
okay so this side let's see definitely
wish I didn't put as much product on the
little sponge because I feel like when
you put a lot on it seems to kind of
just smear it around and that can give
you a nice or not a nice if you give you
a bad cakey finish because see look if I
take it into the sponge and just scoop
up foundation is time just packing off
to the side so I think that using less
is more so here where so I know I got a
towel in here somewhere
let me just like wipe off like half of
it swipe up half and let's just work
with a little bit let's work with half
of the frog to see how that makes
difference okay yeah that's much better
so if you apply less it works better
which is awesome because I mean you're
essentially saving pods I guess by doing
that okay okay so here's this side me
personally I loved the way the cream
applied I liked the way the cream is
sitting on my skin and I mean by that is
that it has a nice skin like finish I
mean this is foundation is just 12
anyway but I like that it didn't just
kind of sit on it it kind of did what a
foundation should do we just kind of
like blend into your skin very
flawlessly we're at this side I did kind
of find a little bit tricky when using
more product it was kind of just
slipping around and even after moving it
it kind of just still has that feeling
that I'm not really blending the
foundation in as much as I can
that's how it feels oh I look at it it
looks fine so maybe that's just a
feeling it gives because it's like a
little silicone whatever but I don't
know to me I've liked how it worked the
cream a lot like I like the cream a lot
so now let me go ahead and find I'm just
trying to find foundation I could just
throw on my face real quick okay so
let's go ahead and try the NARS all day
luminous weightless foundation because
this one's nice and liquidy I really
want to try one that's liquidy to see
how it works and that's really liquidy
so I feel like I want to move it it will
just slip right off the sponge let me
just go ahead and just kind of move
okay I got a lot of extra products let
me just wipe that on to my little handy
towel and let's try to blend this out
okay yeah I don't like it with the
foundation at all I do not like it with
the foundation I did not like about this
foundation it is not blending well at
all yeah this foundation is a little bit
too liquidy it's literally just kind of
moving the product in one area and no
matter how much I do it it still give me
those it's giving me texture in those
circular motions but it's not looking
flawless so I think this foundation is a
little bit too liquidy to work with this
so we've wipe it off let's wipe it off
and let's try another foundation I'm
trying to try as many foundations as I
can to show you guys how it works yeah
but that one yeah that was a no-go I
wasn't wasting much time but that was a
no-go so let's try another one let's try
my Armani luminous silk because this
one's nice and kind of liquidy to do one
pump of that see how that works can't
put too much again it's kind of easy to
waste product because you're used to
kind of using more product than you have
to but I'm telling you if you do happen
to try this use less because I'm saying
that yeah less is less is better okay so
I keep having to remove it I think it's
because my forehead such a small area
but it definitely is blending better
with this foundation then with the NARS
one so that is a good sign okay so yeah
that one definitely blend it better than
the NARS one we cover nards with not
yeah it was not going well the
foundation is a little bit too light for
me so I always mix it but that's not the
point okay we're just kind of blending
okay so yes that's nice but on off my
favorite foundation formula with this
has got to be the cream it just blend it
like a dream and then doing that patting
motion just gave a really nice coverage
out feeling that if you were to use a
cream with it
able to build that coverage so I can
like take more I just go into it and
just pack it on and you're able to get
more coverage it almost kind of helps
you kind of customize the coverage I
just dropped it it almost seems like
you're able to kind of customize the
coverage with the sponge because it's
not uh it's not having a sponge absorb
the product it's just kind of sitting on
the sponge you're able to kind of Pat it
and get your kind of preferred coverage
so I like this I like this from cream so
the cream is the winner in my opinion in
terms of the foundation that works great
with and now I guess for fun we can try
a concealer with it as well or you can
see Lola okay go ahead and try the NARS
creamy concealer get in focus Shani file
a little bit
well okay
he's planning decently you guys
now the only dilemma that I'm running
into here is that I cannot get to that
little middle part because of the way
that the sponge is kind of shaped egg a
mere decently but not the same way that
I can get into it with my beauty blender
aside from that it's pretty nice but
definitely really nice okay so that is
with that and I also want to wipe it off
and that's cool thing about it you can
literally just wipe it off and use it
for other things that's pretty cool I'll
go ahead and see how it works with
powder as well let's just go crazy
actually
should I try to cream contour first no
one would have a cream contour actually
okay yeah let's just stick with the
powder case with the powder it's not
sticking at all so may have a little
dilemma there so let's go ahead and just
try it anyway for fun
yeah I don't think that would powder
it's the best try wipe away the excess
yeah with the powder it isn't the best I
just yeah
the powder didn't really do much for me
in terms of excitement and again it did
everything get in that inner corner to
the inner corners look a little bit
funky so yeah definitely just kind of
keep it for foundation maybe let's try
let's try this too I wanna try blending
it with the cream contour to see how
that work - oops
interesting I'm trying to get an angle
so that it doesn't spread the contour an
unflattering way so that seems to be a
challenge because the sponge is more
flat so I don't want to kind of get the
contour shade everywhere on my cheek but
once you got to get the hang of it it's
actually not that bad but that bad to me
it's a little bit too wide so it's kind
of getting on areas that I will
preferred my contour not to be but it's
still okay so and then again once you're
done with it you can just wipe it off
and you're good to go so I guess that's
it for my demo here let me go ahead and
kind of washes off so I don't look crazy
ending this video okay so that is it for
this video I thought about honestly kind
of putting on a light glam so I can kind
of end it looking a little bit cuter but
you guys know me okay but that is it for
this little review but yeah my final
review is that it works amazing with
cream foundations if I were to use this
with any foundation it will be the cream
foundations to me it works cool with the
other foundations but it's something
that you have to get used to because the
feeling of it is so strange with the
cream it just felt more correct it just
felt proper with the cream it's so hard
to explain if you happen to buy this or
you did purchase it and you're talking
or how to use it try with the cream
foundation because the cream it just
works good I said cream like five times
Green it didn't really uh excite me too
much when it came to the concealer
because I couldn't really get in here
and also with the cream contour it may
take some getting used to in terms of
figuring out how to use it so that it's
not spreading the product everywhere
I don't know that I love it for the
Korean foundation I'm really excited
about the cream foundation using this so
yeah my final thought is I think it's
nice I think that anything that's
different to the beauty community is
pretty cool because sometimes it gets
boring so that's why we're reviewing us
we're trying it because exciting we're
like oh cool a new thing to try out so I
definitely think it's cool for someone
who just Cena wants to try something new
to spice up their routine and yeah if
you have cream foundation it work
beautiful because I loved it but other
than that that is my review I hope you
guys enjoyed it and if you want me to
review anything else let me know and
yeah I will see you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
