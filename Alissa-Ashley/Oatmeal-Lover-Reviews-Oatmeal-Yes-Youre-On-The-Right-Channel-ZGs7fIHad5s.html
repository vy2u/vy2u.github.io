if you follow me on Twitter you know
that I love oatmeal I love oatmeal it's
it's it's one of those foods where I was
like wow I love oatmeal I eat it every
single day I eat it midday 8:00 at night
time I love my oatmeal so I thought hmm
why don't I do why not I review bunch of
different oatmeal flavors but that I
haven't tried for you guys to give you
guys a really serious review on appeal
okay so I'm gonna go ahead and review
this oatmeal
let me show you guys which oats I got no
other companies doing this right now you
know I mean it's kind of cheap you know
like we'll talk about later but I just
hope it's very pigmented and you know
I'm a Quaker I got my I got my I got my
Quakers this is not sponsored by Quakers
I don't even like Quakers old music
because I do but once you're in the
oatmeal game for a long time you do just
elevate your status I got the Quakers I
got to variety packs this one has maple
brown sugar which is actually fun fact
the only flavor of oatmeal that I've
ever tried so this is new to me too it
has cinnamon spice and apples and
cinnamon and then this one it's the
fruit and cream and this I'm excited for
this cliff smells good they have
strawberries and cream blueberries and
cream peaches and cream peaches and
cream and then bananas and cream so
let's go ahead and try it for this gets
cold and I'm gonna be mad so let's go
ahead and try this gold meal let's get
to it so first we're going to go ahead
and by the way each oatmeal is in this
cute little cup cuz I wasn't acquit it
in bowls I'm not gonna waste be wasteful
I'm gonna go ahead put these these
little disposable cups Oh what's getting
all loopy oh my gosh that put enough
water
look at how stiff this whole lethal is
or I'm going to ace a mark see
this is maple and brown sugar oatmeal
all right know how this tastes because
the only one that I ate growing up as a
kid so not either old milk ahem I know
you just like the cinnamon I just get
disgust at the you know what are you
doing why eating that maple brown sugar
oatmeal
it's the jam mmm let's create a rating
system renovate the oatmeal by flavor
wow factor and I mean I guess those only
two things you can kind of rate this old
mill by because they are gonna have the
same consistency so flavor wise maple
brown sugar 10 out of 10 wow factor
hug this a 5 out of 10 because there's
nothing Wow about it cuz I've had it for
all my life
we're gonna give it 10 at 10 so this old
meal it's winter okay I love maple and
brown sugar let's go ahead and try the
other oatmeal's okay so this one this
this is cinnamon spice oatmeal first
time trying it out let's see I like it
oh I don't like those for flavor I give
this 3 out of 10 the only reason why
it's a 3 is because you know how you get
the right pack when you live with
siblings everyone's seen the old mill
and then you go down they're hella
hungry at nighttime and the oume pops up
and you're like damn they only have
cinnamon spice left guess so I have to
eat that's only when I was at 3 because
it's bearable as I'm like I would eat it
at 3 in the morning cuz I was starving
is only one left in the variety pack oh
well I choose it no wow factor I'm
underwhelmed with this oatmeal
this is apples and cinnamon and just
inspecting this old meal I see there's
little chunks and I think that suppose
we apples let's try it out
that's a fake-ass Apple I can I can
speak it's a fake Apple which I mean I
totally get it you know like I can't put
real apples or maybe it's real maybe
it's just dried out I don't really know
that's pretty good though
alrighty so we're gonna mix up this
oatmeal this oatmeal is so hard minutes
kind of break my food we're gonna go
ahead and child this old mill now we
have apples and cinnamon this we're
gonna try out let's see this one okay
okay I definitely think this one is
better then the cinnamon spice why am I
saying here being hella serious about
this I'm serious my my oatmeal man
gonna be serious this is much better
mm-hmm mm-hmm
this is a new favorite flavor
mmm we're gonna give us 1 9 out of 10
because is it like sudden setting off
fireworks it's not let's do a heck of
good so we're given 9 out of 10 wow
factor 10 at 10 because I'm very
pleasantly surprised and it's better
than that cinnamon spice crap and where
I take one my buddy
okay so I think that was it for the
first path the flavor variety overall
I'd say that you to get that pack of
oatmeal I think that let's see you get
four packs of maple and brown sugar you
get four packs of the apples and
cinnamon and then two packs of the nasty
cinnamon spice so at least I know that
cinnamon spice is the weaker link so at
least they included less of that so I'd
say that if you buy it I think that you
like it because I mean maple and brown
is the best in town and then the men
apples and cinnamon is the winnaman so
now let's go ahead and try out the other
pack low key I'm getting like a fool I'm
really contemplating this okay next up
we have I fell off but this is bananas
and cream it even smug bananas barely
okay yes it does I'm like it smells like
banana bread
ooh I don't know if I put more water in
this but the consistency of this one is
definitely less dry and it's more like
smooth
maybe it's the banana inside of it
that's creating that consistency we
don't know we're gonna find out okay
let's go ahead and try out bananas and
cream okay let's see
Wow okay that is very banana II which
I'm not sure if I like that don't like
that too much I feel like if they were
to take a little bit of banana came to
talk it'd be okay but that was very
overwhelming let's go ahead and try one
more spoonful just to see our impression
I mean and I'm not feeling this dude
nope
I don't like that one dude ready so for
that one it has a very funky aftertaste
that I am NOT buki with okay don't like
that one too much there's too much
banana inside of it Quakers you're
watching this maybe tone down on the
banana and then I'll give my life but
okay flavor wise I would say that's
about 5 out of 10 because I mean it
tastes good but then it's like that five
points got knocked down because the
aftertaste is very like what the heck is
going on in my mouth and then wow factor
I'm gonna go ahead and give it a 10 9 10
because I was wowed wild about the fact
there's too much banana in it so it's
not a good Wow but we're student give it
ten at ten let's go ahead and try some
more right next we have this one I
mislabel
okay yeah this is not Pisa cream
okay so I mislead with him
this one is peaches and cream this wood
is blueberry cream you could literally
see the blueberries how does that label
that peaches I don't know but we're
gonna try we're trapped blueberries and
cream first
even though mislabeled it okay so this
one is nice consistency in the oatmeal
I'm not really a huge fan of blueberries
unless send muffins so we're gonna see
how I like this let's go ahead and take
a little spoonful of that Bon Appetit oh
I'm vibing with it oh wow Wow okay okay
okay for that one flavor ten at ten char
you attend and then for wild factor ten
at ten I would say that it was very
pleasant and it reminded me of a
blueberry muffin but an oatmeal form so
I kind of got my life so go blueberry
now let's go ahead and try peaches and
green
well let's try it you know to see if
it's good oh okay new water hold on okay
so peaches and cream I just fail them
but flavor-wise I'm gonna have to give
that a 7 out of 10 because I feel like
I'm a texture person and those little
peaches bits I'm just like like it feels
so different compared to the old mill
and I just don't really like that
mixture it just didn't really flow well
in my mouth and then wow factor I would
say like a 8 at 10 because I think the
flavor was on point it was really good
peaches and cream you know what I mean
and yeah I mean the flavor was on point
but I just can't go over that texture so
we got knocked off some points for
peaches and cream and now we have the
last one which I'm glad because I'm
honestly like a fool I'm so fool this is
strawberries and cream it smells really
good it's going to mix it up I think it
looks disgusting
I mean I think that looks really nasty
what do you guys think I mean looks
gross but we're gonna try it out oh wow
oh wow wow oh wow some good stuff man
Wow flavor-wise 11 out of 10 this is so
good and baby it's because now I'm on a
happy high so like everything's a be
good to me but this is really good this
is some good stuff
let's see wow factor Wow
LM not in I'd say that out of all the
old meals that I try out today
this one is the number one oatmeal that
I've tried I'm like in disbelief I'm
like what is it called when you're like
really happy utopia you do folk whatever
you fo pay you for eeeh that's what I am
this is so good I miss out on my own
little world there's clouds around me

glad that we ended it on a green oh wow

the oatmeal that I usually make but
