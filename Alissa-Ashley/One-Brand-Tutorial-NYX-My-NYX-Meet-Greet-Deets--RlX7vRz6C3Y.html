time no see I know if you are like in my
loop you know that I just lose to my
first apartment so I have been just
unpacking and doing a bunch of stuff so
I'm so sorry for me am ia but I'm slowly
getting into the groove of filming so do
not worry have no fear today's video is
going to be a one brand make a tutorial
and the brand is NYX Cosmetics I decide
to do NYX because I am actually happy
indeed ingredients with NYX and here's a
little flyer here's all the details and
I have all the details down below the
reasons I don't want to say them is
because I don't want to get something
wrong because I just know my brain so
everything that you need to know is
popping up on the screen it will be in
one eye Creek brownie plaza as where all
the stores are I'm always there and it's
going to be outdoors from 6 to 8 p.m.
and I just really hope to see all my Bay
Area peeps there because I want you guys
so I'm really excited it's like my
second meeting greed so a clown nervous
but I just know it's gonna be fun hope
you guys are there in attendance so yeah
without further ado let's just go ahead
and jump into this look if you guys want
to see more one brand making tutorials
let me know and let me know which brand
you want to see down below other that
thank you so much for being here and you
being patient with me while I move and
let's just yeah let's just jump this
tutorial cuz I'm just talking now ok so
the first thing we do is take this nyx
honey do me up and i'm so go ahead and
use this as like a primer just leather
it on my face
it feels very hydrating and it kind of
just kind of wakes my skin up and i know
this because i degree film this video
three times already so every sometimes
put this on I just felt off so I'm gonna
go ahead and massage it in
now I'm going to take the mineral stick
foundations I'm going to shades 9 and 10
and I learned that it comes out the best
but put nine in the center part of my
face
and then ten on the perimeter this 10 is
a little bit darker I'm going to take
this morphe 439 or in 439 brush go ahead
and blend this out
next I'm take this highlight and contour
duo and this in the shade was this this
is shape 4 and I'm going to use the
highlight shade under the eyes obviously
in my forehead then that I explained
this and at first I didn't when I got
this product I was only obsessed with
the contour shade because usually I just
have my little other conceal or my
little Holy Grail drugstore concealers
but this actually works pretty well
because I used it yesterday and I really
liked it and it reminds me of my NARS
radiant creamy concealer actually but
just a little bit more hydrating the
NARS one is a little bit more on the
matte side so I like them both that was
really nice and I'm gonna go ahead and
just blend this in with a damp Beauty
Blender
and I'm gonna go in with the contour
shade and use that for my cheekbones I'm
use that same brush for my foundation
just to blend this up
to set my under eye I'm taking this
hydro touch Foundation and this in the
shade golden I know it's a foundation
but it's very very lightweight so it's
great for under the eye well from my
experience I'm going to rub this beauty
blender into it and just go right
underneath I and then while that sits
for a little bit I'm going to take the
shade honey it's also a Hydra touch and
I'm going to use this morphe e to set
the rest of my face now I'll go ahead
and do my brows I'm gonna take Nick's
Taemin frame and it's in the shape
chocalate and this is just an old Mac
angled brush I think the 266 it's all
yeah the Schilling is gone I'm go ahead
and use this to my brows
now to clean them up i'ma take that
highlight contour duo and I'm going to
take some of that highlight shade and
put on the back of my hand and I'm going
to take this morphe in one sixty and
I'll go ahead and use this to clean up
my brows you know they're pretty sharp
so they actually don't even eat cleaning
but it's just like a it's a habit and
then to prime my eyes today I'm using
the eyeshadow base and this is number
three I like number three because it has
a little tint to it so it kinda reminds
me of Mac soft ochre in that sense I
don't like using white primers that's
move the HD and crazy so I will go ahead
and use this instead now go ahead and
just set it in place with my face powder
for eyeshadow the look is actually
really really easy I'm taking this
full-throttle i shadow and let's see
which one of this it's number eight
color riot and it is so pigmented you
guys will see it actually reminds me a
little bit of the Anasazi of Modern
Renaissance palette but just like a
little mini version so I'm gonna take
this orange eyeshadow first and this is
a more feet are thirty seven and go
ahead and just place this all in my
crease area I'm gonna take this vivid
beautiful cranberry whatever you want to
call it shade and I'm place that right
on top
I'm going to take this more feat in 518
it just just softened everything out and
this brush is no eye shadow on them just
use it to kind of soften everything out
of it I'm going to take this morphe in 5
6 to take that cranberry shade and just
continue to apply it wanting more
intense
well that escalated quickly I just kind
of got into all the world and started
doing all this stuff but I like how it's
hang out so far I'm going to take this
Real Techniques smudge brush and place
that cranberry shade underneath here as
well okay so on this side I can re wet
head did some stuff because I just
needed to have a plan okay so I'm gonna
take this pigment it's called Shanghai
Sun it's like an orange pigment also by
NYX and I'm taking some of the
multitasker mixing mediums on the back
of my hand
and this is a in blocked 9s brush and
apply this on my lid only in the little
inner corner part though and then at all
about conside riot I'm going to take
this matte liquid liner and go ahead and
create a wing
and I'm going to take this pigment it's
clock go ham it's a really pretty golden
yellow pigment and I'm I take this uh
what is this royal and langnickel mini
smudger brush and I pop this in my
little flap you fold to highlight and
then we're an extra little lint I'm
going to take that white shimmery shadow
in the inner corner on this little
palette and I'm going to take this same
brush go ahead and pop this in my brow
bone in that four bottom mascara I'm
going to take the double stacked mascara
it comes with fibers and mascara so you
just put the mascara on and the virus
then mascara and just builds up and
creates very nice lashes now we're go
ahead and finish off the rest of the
face I'm going to take the new nofilter
finishing powder and open its art open
things about nails and this is the shade
14 I'm hogging me and I'm taking this
morphe brush it's like one of their
blinged-out brushes I use this just to
contour
man from blush I'm taking this bless
right here it's called double dare and
actually one of my favorite NYX blushes
and just blushes in general because very
orange and pigmented so just make sure
dust it off but it gives a really nice
warmth to the cheeks and I'm going to
take this tango with bronzing powder
it's new to me and it has like a
bronzing powder and almost like a
highlight as well I'm taking this morphe
b8 I'm taking a highlight shade my use
is for my highlight today that's nice
that is so nice
and then from the color first I'm take
this lip liner this is the suede matte
lip liner and the reason it's called
suede is because these lip liners were
inspired by some of the liquid suede
that was cool and this is club topper
time into that ready I probably did go
ahead and line my lips with this
and then for lip color I'm taking this
full-throttle
lipstick and this is just so cool
because at first it was my first time
trying it yesterday at first I was
applying it I was like this looks like
it's going to be very very shiny but it
dries down matte it's the most
interesting thing ever and this in the
shade loaded so what see how I'm flying
it it looks all like shiny and applies
kind of almost liquidy
it's really weird you'll see the magic
okay so lip color for the most part is
dry and go ahead and do my hair put some
clothes on hi we're back so here is the
finished look I've been living my hair
like this lately just I just wet it a
little bit conditioner and I just go
