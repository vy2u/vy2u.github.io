today's video is going to be this peachy
makeup look and I decide to do this
peachy look because if you follow me on
snapchat Too Faced hosted an amazing
event surrounding the return of the
sweet peach palette as well as them
adding new things to the sweet peach
collection so I was able to get all
those products so I'm going to be
showing you guys them today and using
them in this tutorial and I also decided
to use all the other two-faced items
that I have in terms of foundation
concealer bronzer all that stuff so it's
pretty much a one brand makeup tutorial
aside from just like three other things
like my brows and stuff I tried to make
it predominantly to face because you
guys were asking for that and it's cool
because I could show you guys the new
products so you want to see how I
created this look as well as the new
stuff and just keep on watching and
don't forget to subscribe it's right
down there I don't know why I never
encourage you guys subscribe I should do
that I should like yeah subscribe to me
but yeah just remind you to subscribe if
you watch my videos and if you're new go
ahead and do that enjoy the family we're
so close to 500,000 subscribers just
freaking amazing and I really want to
get there before the year ends so do
that for me please but yeah without
further ado let's go ahead and jump into
this video and I hope you guys enjoy it
the first time I just go ahead and prime
using the hangover primer I've had this
for a while and I can't just bought it
because I kept seeing everyone else
where it says okay I want it but I don't
think I've ever used on my channel
before maybe like once
next time go ahead and take the Born
This Way Foundation and I'm in the shake
caramel and I've noticed that the Born
This Way Foundation were the one that I
have is more on the I don't know what
tone I would call it it's definitely not
super yellow tone which is fine most of
my foundations are very yellow tone
because I have a yellow undertone but
this one works as well it's more neutral
I would say go ahead and blend this out
and let's just stop and go grab my
mirror cuz in the other room see how
this doesn't really have a lot of yellow
to it it's more so just very neutral but
it blends to my skin really well
next for concealer I'm gonna take the
Born This Way concealer and this is a
shade medium tan
now I looked on the two-faced site and
it seems like they do have setting
powders however they were not at my
local support and I did not have enough
time to order them for this video so let
me go ahead and just set my face in
place with the powers I normally use
they'll be linked up below and I'll be
right back okay so I went ahead and did
my brows off camera as well as well as
kind of just did this I really quickly
and go ahead and start with the eye
shadow and I may use the shadow
insurance a 24-hour shadow insurance to
prime my lids kind of blend this out
with the morphe y 16 and then with all
of my primers like just go ahead and put
a little bit loose powder to set it in
place now taking the star of the show
which is the sweet peach palette I'm
going to take these shade puree and I'm
taking this morphe b79
I'm gonna go ahead and just place it in
my crease area next I'm go ahead and
take the shape summer young which is
even more warm toned and they're both
pretty warm tone shadows I find this
palette has a nice mixture of both warm
and cool tones but obviously I'm warm
tone person so I line with the warm
tones so I'm go ahead and place that
right on top to neck and take a shake
candied peach even though has a bit of a
shimmer it will still work to kind of
add some pink eNOS to the eye to make it
more peachy and then switching over to
this brush bride dose of colors the
concealer brush I'm going to take that
and place it on my lid I'm not gonna
place over the entire lid I'm just gonna
do like half the lid because I want to
just kind of make I don't know I want
more emphasis on the crease than I do
the lid today
and then directly on top of that I'm
going to take the shade candy peach
after that I go ahead and create a wing
and I want it the emphasis of the wing
to be more on the outer corner so the
outer corners be a little bit thicker
and the inner parts to be a little bit
thinner and this is the two phase sketch
marker now go ahead and pop the shade
peaches and cream directly into my brow
bone area it's a very nice pigmented
creamy off-white shade it's very pretty
and then I'll go ahead and take the
shade just peachy and pop that right on
top and I know it's a pink but I kind of
want the Bravo and have a pinky kind of
peachy little tone to it just so kind of
goes and flows with the look now I'm
going to go ahead and pop that peaches
and cream in the flappy fold and I'm
also going to mix in the pinky shade as
well and then on my waterline I'm taking
that first shade that I took from my
crease or the second one actually this
is summer young place that on that area
down below and then right inner corner
I'm taking the shade candied peach next
time I go ahead and pop on some better
than sex mascara this is the waterproof
one and then for lashes I'm taking Lena
lashes in the style Naomi
now to finish off my face I'm going to
take my infamous to base dark chocolate
Soleil bronzer I used to use this like
in every single video so I tried to like
calm down on it because I knew that like
I was okay maybe they're getting bored
but you guys know this is like my Holy
Grail and this is the morphe for
and if I blush I'm going to take the new
blush which is the Papa Doble peach and
it's so adorable I'll use the same brush
just apply this very warm oh my god it
smells like peaches see I can just add
like a luminous to my skin I don't think
I can see that but see how this is kind
of like more radiant I like that I like
that a lot
then a person it's like you're getting
this very faint blush color but it's
very nice and like luminous I like that
I really do and then for my highlight
I'm going to take these sweet peach glow
I'm going to take the nice golden shade
on the far left and this is a morphe Y
14
and then for my lip color I'm going to
take the new creamy peach oil lip gloss
and they came out with eight of them but
I'm going to take the shades peach tease
and pop and peach and mix them together
and then I decide to randomly do foil
freckles but I didn't really talk
because I did not really know where it
was going I didn't know how they come
out but then again I also want to record
it because I feel like you guys would
have killed me if I did not record it so
I'm just taking this kind of like marker
that I have and it's light brown and I'm
just creating the most natural faux
freckles that can create if you guys
want to see a video on faux freckles let
me know because I liked how they turned
out okay so I want to do my lip color
over after icon just did this faux
freckle edge I just felt like some of my
actual dip color it's just too dark so
it's just kind of showing through in a
way I don't like so I'm just go ahead
and take this concealer which is the
same shade as my face and just kind of
smear it all over I'm gonna go ahead and
take those same glosses and just pop the
right on top so that is its for this
makeup tutorial and here is how to look
came out now obviously you can go with a
more bold lip color if you want to
however I liked the kind of sweet and
simple and kind of softer peach look and
I also want to use obviously the new
products
so yeah just saw that out there if you
don't like the more neutral lip but I do
so hope you guys like it as well and yes
you want to see any other one brand or
brand focused videos or just any videos
that you may want to see and let me know
I have a bunch coming up planned but I
had to order stuff so that's wait so but
I will see you guys in my next video and
hope you guys like this one and give a
thumbs up okay just grab and Annika
