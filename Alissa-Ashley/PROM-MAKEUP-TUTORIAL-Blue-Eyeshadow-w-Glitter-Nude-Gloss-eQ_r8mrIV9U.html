today's tutorial I decided to do this
really bold and pretty glittery blue eye
let's go ahead and get some close-ups I
really hope you guys enjoy this look
because yeah glues are very very
intimidating to me they're actually more
intimidating than blacks are so I was a
little bit scared and I did two refilm
this look again because I noticed some
you know small errors in the first
tutorial and I feel like I'm not doing
my job I'm teach you guys how to mess up
so I decided to redo it so if you guys
like it also be sure to comment down
below your prom dress color so I'm able
to do a video for you as well because
this was requested me to do a blue look
other than that I don't want to talk too
much let's just get into toriel and hope
you guys like it and if you do like it

video and not other good stuff because
you guys support means everything to me
yeah hmm okay I'll Don you guys later
okay so first we do is take this pencil
from Sephora it's called my boyfriend
jeans it's a really pretty blue shade
I'm going to place that all over my eye
right in my crease area before dries up
I'm going to take my Judy's place brush
and just really work on blending that
out
I'm go ahead and add some tape to the
outer corner of my eye so I like a sharp
edge next I'm taking makeup geeks
Neptune eyeshadow just place that right
on top and I'm taking blueberry where's
the deeper blue and place that right on
top now picking bedrock which is a nice
soft gray shade just to kind of soften
it up a bit
times I take my shape up higher just to
match my other eye because I know this
is my other eye has I shot a little bit
higher
now I'm going to take some Knicks
glitter glue and place it all over my
lid and then for my pigment I'm gonna
take this pigment from donessa my rigs
and it's called
sequin it's a really nice blue shade
obviously so pretty that is
and then on top of that I'm going to
take this face and body glitter by NYX
and it doesn't have a name so I'll just
link it down below I got it from old
times I pack them right on top just add
even more sparkle now I'm going to go
ahead and apply some concealer over here
already have that I done you know like
as far as concealer because I want to
see what it look like such as the same
for this I just make sure to try to get
really really neat
so my forehead as well well level over
here go ahead and take my Laura Mercier
powder to set that in place I'm when you
just powder to set the rest of my face
as well
I absolutely take miler Mercier powder
and place underneath both eyes because I
am going to finish them up and I do not
want any blue under my freaking eye
otherwise they look actually horrible so
I want to make sure I have enough powder
to catch all that fallout to complete
the under eye on my take that my
boyfriend Jean sounds club right my
boyfriend's jeans place it in my
waterline and once we meet my waterline
I didn't take it all the way in I
stopped like Midway there just blend
that out gotta take a pencil brush and
Neptune just to really set that in place
and I'm going to take this brush it's my
concealer brush royal and nickel I put
some of my boyfriend jeans on it and I'm
just going to create a sharp edge
gonna go ahead and apply my lily lashes
you didn't install Miami I do have a
code for these lashes if you want it
make sure you get it on all the way up
poke my eye out now to finish off the
rest of the face I'm going to take my
benefit hoola bronzer and you want take
a bronze that's more cool town just to
kind of go with the cool toned mists of
your eyes I don't really want to look
bronzed I kinda just wanna look nice and
mattified I guess she didn't say I'm so
gonna highlight though I got the
highlight obviously from blush I'm going
to take mega Peaks summer fling blush I
want to take a nice soft kind of peachy
coral color cuz I feel like that kind of
shake goes perfectly blues or it could
be like you know a Conca a plum ish pink
shade it all looks really nice as well
but I own one of those posh aids I'm
take a nice coral color and for
highlight I'm taking Becca's opal
because I like you know this shade
especially for this eye look it's nice
and you know cool toned not too golden
and then for lips I'm going to take
tarts glossy lip paint in the color snap
