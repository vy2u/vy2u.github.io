so today's video is going to be another
Halloween makeup tutorial and this one
is a sexy poison ivy look and honestly
this wasn't even planned this was not
planned I had did a green on Marie I
shall look and Twitter was like poison
ivy poison ivy because I didn't know
what to do with it
so I wash it off I wind bots and leaves
and everything and I put together poison
ivy look and this is the final result so
I really like how it turned out hope you
guys liked it as well
if you want to see in the other
Halloween making tutorial be sure to
comment down that comment that down
below other than that don't I have this
intro to be too long
make sure to give this video a thumbs up
if you liked it let's go ahead and just
get started okay so the first thing I'm
doing is just taking my honest hacia
waterproof cream color in the shade
honey just to lighten up my brow if you
do have thicker brow hairs you may want
to do the little blue method just to
kind of glue them down and get your
brows nice and muted but I really have
many hairs to begin with so ought to do
is take my cream color and some loose
powder just to lighten my brows now for
brows I'm taking this liquid lipstick
and this is by code rain in the shade
red C and I'm just going to create my
brows and you want to be patient with
this because if you mess up it is really
hard to remove because it's liquid
lipstick and it has strong staying power
so just make sure that you take your
time and then afterwards I'm gonna go
ahead and just conceal my brow / yuj and
prime it with my honest Asya waterproof
cream color and set it lightly with some
powder oh yeah and I also took some tape
just to sharpen it up I guess the little
clip of me setting it got deleted
whatever anyways next I'm taking this
NARS I paint this in the shade
mozambique i've been using a lot lately
and i'm using this just so that my green
is nice and vibrant and i want to really
pop and for my green I'm taking this
Suva Beauty palette and it has a really
gorgeous green in it and to soften up
that green I'm going to take the white
eyeshadow in the palette I didn't want
to take any other
transition color I want it to be true
green and then the outer corner I'm
gonna go ahead and add some black I want
to do an ombre eye and I want to be nice
and kind of vixeny it's so hard to
explain but it's very sultry adding
black to that outer corner of the eye
and then as you can see I'm just taking
green eyeshadow just to soften up that
black just to make sure the blend is
nice and poppin
so I'm just going back and forth between
the black and the green and then for the
inner corner I'm just taking my mac
makes a medium liner and I'm popping on
this shadow from the melt cosmetics
radioactive stack just so I can have a
nice vibrant neon green just to finish
up my little ombre eyeshadow look I was
going for and then I'm going to go ahead
and do a very tiny winged liner but I
just felt like winged liner really
pulled the look together and then I'm
gonna top this off with some lashes and
these early lashes in style Miami and
now let's move into the face for the
face already had foundation on so I'm
just taking my Tarte shaped tape
concealer and I decide to make sure that
my face was very glam I highlighted
areas that I normally never highlight
but I want it to be very defined and
just sexy so I'm gonna go ahead and just
blend it out with a Beauty Blender
after I'm done playing that out I'm
going to go ahead and take this honest
Ostia foundation stick just to cream
contour because I want my cheekbones to
be very defined and I went ahead and
blended in that lighter concealer
underneath it as well just to make sure
everything is nice and blended and I'm
gonna go ahead and take my Lorimer
powder my Laura Mercier powder just to
set my highlighted areas in place and
I'm taking my Sephora micro smooth
powder just to set the rest of my face
because I want to be nice and flawless
and this powder is flawless I just I
love it it's amazing and then for my
contour I'm taking my contour blush by
NARS I'm taking basically products that
I know will have me looking flawless
because I want to look flawless
I set flaws like ten times already but
anyways I'm just going a little bit more
heavier than usual on my contour and
then for my nose I switched over to my
morphe in five to four brush and I
snatched the hell out of my nose it
looked amazing I loved it and then I
took a look at my brows and I realized I
wanted them to have just more of a ooh
so I took it that super Beauty palette
that I used earlier it has a nice
beautiful vibrant red and I just put
that at the front part of my brows and
I'm taking moslem beak and I'm placing
this all over my waterline and I'm just
gonna kind of smoke it out just a little
bit and set it in place with the green
Suva Beauty eyeshadow and I'm going to
take a little bit of black eyeshadow
just to place on the outer corner to
really make my eyes look nice and sexy
and then I went ahead with that neon
green eyeshadow and place that on my
flappy fold just what those are you know
get some love to it one neglect the
flappy fold so I put some green in it
and it looked so nice and then I also
placed that green on the outer part of
the eye just just really add to the
sexiness of his eye look and then for my
highlight it actually took a white
eyeshadow I wanted my highlight to be
visible but not shimmery so the white
eyeshadow really gave me what I was
looking for so yeah definitely different
for me but it looked great and it really
enhanced those parts of my face without
too much so I was very impressed with
the white eyeshadow
after that I'm go ahead and apply my lip
color this is Red Sea FICO drain which
is the same liquid lipstick that I use
on my brows and as you can see I'm kind
of creating myself a different Cupid's
bow just to give my lips a little more
of a different appearance for this look
more sexy and then I'm go ahead and just
draw these leaves and I just looked at a
photo of ivy and I just kind of outlined
with my Kat Von D trooper liner and then
I filled it in
why gotta focus first I filled it in
with my makeup forever flash palette and
this is the green in that palette and
this part was pretty easy actually and
then afterwards I set it in place with
the super Beauty green eyeshadow and
then I'm gonna go ahead and add some
detailing with some black eyeshadow just
so they look a little bit more
what-do-you-call-it detailed and I also
added these little leaves on the other
part of my face but since that is the
left side of my face I'm terrible at
doing things on the left on camera so I
did not show that but you get the point
and in the final step for this look is
just applying my little fake leaves that
I got from Hobby Lobby and how I'm gonna
do this is I'm just taking the leaves
off of the little plastic stem they come
up very easily applying a spirit gum to
where I'm applying the leaves and you
have to let the spirit gum dry so it
gets tacky and then I'm gonna go ahead
and just place my leaves right on top I
took a mixture of small and big leaves
just to give a variation and yeah that
will be the final step of this look I
really hope you guys like how this
little poison ivy look turned out and if
you did be sure to give this video a
thumbs up other than that thank you so
much for watching hope you guys enjoyed
this look and I will see you guys soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
