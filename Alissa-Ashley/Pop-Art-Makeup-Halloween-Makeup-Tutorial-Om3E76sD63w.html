today's video is going to be a Halloween
making tutorial on this platform stuff
that you see right here at you guys what
you want to see and I got a couple of
wool actually a lot of pop art comments
so I decided to go ahead and do my take
on that and I decided to do it just a
little bit differently as opposed to
doing a full face
I decided to kind of carve it out -
whatever you want to call it some of you
guys like that little different twist
also I brought the video it may seem
like I'm a bit confused as to what I'm
doing that's because I was and I would
just kind of go with the flow and I
almost stopped my way by do not help you
guys like to look because I'm just
really weird about Halloween look so I
hope you guys like it
so you want to see how I achieve this
and just keep on watching and you want
to see me do other Halloween looks than
just comment down below other than that
let's just go ahead and get started okay
so I had a lot of difficulties while
filming this difficulties meaning my
camera stopped recording in multiple
scenes and one of the being the eyebrows
but all I did was take this makeup
forever liner at the aqua liner so it's
waterproof and I just filled in my brow
the way I would normally do it but just
super thick and unrealistic and then I
also use this honest hacia waterproof
cream color and the shade honey
just as my base for all of my eye shadow
and just to make sure have a nice even
lid now what I'm doing here is just
taking this white pencil and just
carving out where I plan on putting my
little pop art I kind of want to give
like a paper like edge which is why it's
uneven and I'm gonna go ahead and just
fill in the little portion of my brow
that is on the side where I'll be doing
all my pop art and imma go ahead and
just add in this little detail on the
brow I looked at a lot of pop art
reference photos just to do this because
I
doing and then I'm gonna go ahead and
just make the brows a little more round
because I just didn't like the whole
school year look browsing next I'm
taking this eye shadow
I'll have that listed down below it is a
teal eye shadow and I just noticed that
in a lot of pop art reference photos the
eye shadow is nice and vibrant so you
can choose whatever color works best for
you but I want to do teal and then I'm
going to go ahead and just take this
felt tip liquid liner and I'm going to
go ahead and outline the eye shadow
because it's not supposed to be normal
eyes will see pop art so I have to
outline these shape and as you can see I
kind of didn't fill in all the way and I
kind of wanted to leave it that way just
to make sure I was getting the shape
that I wanted first and I'm gonna go
ahead and just fill in that little
missing portion that did not get filled
in next I'm taking this white pencil and
I'm just going to make my eyes appear
more bright and then underneath that I'm
taking this Too Faced felt tip liner and
I'm just going to go ahead and just
create a line it's hard to explain I'm
doing because I mean I don't know what
I'm doing I'm just following reference
photos and pop art photos but it's
pretty easy to follow along you're just
creating a fake little eye line wherever
you call it and then fake lashes and I
took that white pencil and I'm just
trying to mark out where I want my tears
to be I did not know that tears be so
hard to draw they're just little bubbles
I was like oh my god like how did he do
tears so I finally got together and then
after I do that I'm just going to
outline those tears with my felt tip
little marker just so I can know where
I'm gonna be filling it in and then
after that I'm going to go ahead and
just fill it in with some white pencil I
didn't really know what I was doing with
this honestly so I had to go back in
with the mint pencil and on top of this
I'm gonna put another blue pencil and
honestly you can skip all these steps
really you just need a white pencil but
I just I couldn't find my blue eye
shadow and then I found my blue eye
shadow after doing all this so I'm just
letting you know that you do not have to
do all this I'll do it right now to get
some vibrant blue
I just yeah I was meeting my life
together okay I was in shambles and then
afterwards I'm going to finally go back
in with that felt tip liner and just we
bowled in a word no I redefined my
little tease and then I'll be done with
that for now and imma go ahead and just
add my little nose definition again I
looked at reference photos to know what
to do because I didn't know what to do
so I just looked at reference photos and
the nose had some definition going on so
I decided to do that as well just to
bring it all together and then the next
step is applying my little comic dots I
did the four head off care because based
on the way that the mirror was
positioned you guys wouldn't have been
able to see things I was okay that would
be a little bit pointless and annoying
so I'm just taking this brown pencil
first and I'm taking a brush um with
some of the dots because since I have
foundation on the pencil is not being
you know cooperative so I may have just
going with the pencil just to make sure
that the circles are smooth but yet you
have a great pencil you not need the
brush so yeah just continue to apply
your dots
um this is just honestly so boring so as
I'm speeding it up because it's like
it's nothing exciting and I had to go
ahead and just complete my little paper
ripped edges on the shoulder area and
just continuing my dots and then after
this I'm gonna go in with a red paint
and I'm just just brightening the dots
and I just didn't want to keep the dots
that brown color because it wasn't
really comic it wasn't vibrant so I want
to go in with the red paint and I'm just
going just doing the thing oh I also
decided to just add in my little cheek
bone line at this moment before
continuing the dots just to make it
easier because I know that it may be a
little bit complicated
trying to put that felt tip liner over
the paint so I just want to avoid that
and actually continuing my dots and with
the red paint I was a little bit more
patient with it took my time because I
didn't want these to appear definitely
more neater than the brown liner so yeah
just take your time
and I also decide to just go ahead and
outline my face while I was at it
honestly with this look Alan all over
the place because I did not know you
know what I was doing so I was just kind
of going to flow and just completing
different things and just bouncing back
and forth because that's just how I do
things that's how I complete my work
that's just how I work as an artist so
yeah you don't have to do this you can
do like you know more organized fashion
of creating this look but I'm just all
over the place that's just who I am
naturally so this is what I'm doing so
sorry about that so yeah back to
continuing the red dots and yep just
making sure they're nice and neat and
this paint is from NYX it's actually the
bomb as you can see it's really vibrant
so I was very happy about that and now
I'm moving on to my favorite part which
was the lips I'm taking this coloured
raine cherry blossom lipstick and it's
better if you use liquid lipstick as
opposed to a regular lipstick and I'll
kind of explain why in just a bit but
after I apply my layer of lipstick I am
when I move on to applying some mascara
and some lashes I think I changed the
lashes I later on to the look but I did
this just to miel occupy myself while
the liquid lipstick was drying you know
you just had to keep bouncing back and
forth just so you don't get bored so
just do what you can while you're
waiting for something else to be
completed and I'm moving in to outlining
the lips now they're dry the reason why
I mentioned that using and liquid
lipstick is preferred is not because I
actually knew what I'm talking about
it's because I watched a tutorial on how
to do pop our lips by Jordan Hans here
on YouTube she has a full tutorial which
was awesome and super convenient because
I did not know what to do so I'll make
sure link her tutorial down below
because that's just who I use as a
reference and you got to give credit
where credit is due and our tutorials
are awesome and you should subscribe to
her anyway because she's doing a
tutorial literally every single day this
month that's just insane that's goals I
cannot do it but anyways she said I
liquid lipstick is best
so that is what I'm using and I just
simply followed her tutorial as a
reference which is why I'm gonna link
hers down below because she'll explain
all this stuff she'll break it down to
you the way I can't
oh and PS if you are going to recreate
this look you should definitely get your
hands on this NYX liquid liner the white
one because it was perfect
it gave me no problems it was definitely
easier than paint would have been for me
personally and it's just so vibrant as
you can see it's a true white so it just
made everything so easy and it lasts a
long time and it did not budge
whatsoever so good job good job and I'm
gonna go ahead and just remove that
little line on the sides I was okay that
doesn't Iggy's in so yeah and then I'm
gonna go ahead and just take my Kat Von
D trooper liner and just outline where I
decide to do my little paper edges I
decided that it will be better if it was
black in shadowy so it almost looks like
the pop art is popping off on my body my
baddie I'm such a weirdo that's how I
pronounce body okay so yeah just
creating shadows I'm taking this NYX
face and body paint it is black it does
not break you out because I've been
using it just to kind of practice and
create stuff and so far so good so just
letting you know it's an A in my book
and to continue to create my shadowing
it's pretty easy to follow I'm going to
do the NYX paint first and I'm gonna
apply some black eyeshadow and just
smooth it out and just do my thing
and then this last and final step to
this look is optional applying some
glitter glitter makes everything better
and I was kind of devastated because my
memory card had completely filled up but
I did not get notified so I was just a
blind stuff and it wasn't even recording
but all I'm doing is taking my Mac makes
me medium eyeliner if you are in subby
here you know that I use that to here
things to basically everything and I'm
just taking that first and then packing
my glitter on top and I honestly think
that the glitter really made the look
the look it made it awesome so that
would be the final step and then you're
done with your little pop art Slayers
and you're ready for Halloween so here
is the finished look I hope you guys
enjoyed it if you want to see any other
Halloween tutorials you better let me
know so I can do it other than that
thank you so much for watching and I
will see you guys soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
