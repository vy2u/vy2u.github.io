today's video isn't going to be a
tutorial it's actually me trying a
product I bought this like over a month
ago and I just I never got around to
using it and it's like by the time I got
out like maybe probably won't see it or
want to see it but on Twitter you guys
want to see it so this is the color on
professional I'm sure you guys have seen
people use these it is when it's like
you put the eyeshadow on it's supposed
to just be eyeshadow I'll not explain
this crap okay
it's basically press-on eyeshadows well
it looks like so I'm gonna try this out
today so yeah let's just do it um that's
a color instructions oh it does it's on
the back Alyssa Wow
okay okay so I got the I think I got the
smokey they all just drop I'm in
shambles but I got the smoky one and it
comes with a set of five one two three
four five so it comes with five
different colors that's what it look
like
hope you guys can see my lights kind of
bright but this one looks like these are
B eyeshadows and it comes with an
applicator in a setting powder so let's
read is instruction shall ye I can open
okay there we go
Jesus some all over the place okay so
sets to place it smooth it peel it blend
it set it for our reason I don't like
have to involve water or something but
let's see we have noche another noche oh
wait all those doubles oh wow
so I think that I'm gonna try just a
couple of them they have like a purple
one ish yeah it's called ill so we're
gonna try it ill first alright let's
just try a brown first just to kind of
be simple this is called Ibiza so let's
just see okay so I place it oh okay so
okay uh-oh
okay wait I show you guys pop see okay
so you kind of like lift it and then
it's like if you lift this thing it's
makeup on it Oh
I'm Pekka fascinated okay so do I put
them oh how do I put this color hmm
so wait I don't know how this was to go
okay yeah so I just wants to do so I
just place it on my eye God and I just
press I smooth it out
and then I peel it off okay
holy crap okay I'm like kind of confused
I'm like why the hell it doesn't have a
little little what'd he call them the
thingies the little dots but whatever so
now I guess had to blend it this brush
is like trash like the bristles are like
in shambles but let's see uh okay so
kind of like a creamy okay why why the
bristles falling on the eyeshadow okay
so I'll brush I'm a cheat he's my own
brush what the hell let's take this more
feet in 518 to blend this out cuz that
brush was ridiculous so I guess you just
blend it out it has a creamy consistency
this is like inch Davis heck interesting
this is like low-key kind of working I
mean like aside from the fact that I
mean the actual color choice I'll expect
to be a little bit more deeper I mean
low-key I mean this is kind of a look
like oh my god I mean this is kind of
nice though like the color I mean I
don't know like something about is nice
like it wasn't as bad as I was gonna be
so now I gotta give this setting powder
we open it up oh ah savage okay open
here I'm trying to set you wanna have to
sniff it take this uh fluffy brush to
set it so you just set it okay let's see
I mean Loki this is actually kind of
nice like in terms of the actual like
product itself like the consistency is
actually really smooth I'm very shocked
by this right now I think this is kind
of cool like on the low low on the low
low like I mean when I wear it every day
absolutely not
but like it's kind of cool okay I mean I
was expecting more of an ombre but aside
from that I mean the eyeshadow is heck
of smooth I'm not sure you guys can see
how smooth it is
that's very smooth I kind of like this I
mean granted well I like offered like
different shapes if I was his company as
opposed to just one shape yeah but I
mean it kind of fit let's try not a
color I want try this other color cuz
now I'm like okay so let's try this one
so I forgot to like show you guys but
you just peel this little part off and
the product is like inside and then you
just take the eyeshadow thingy let me
get it off this thing without messing it
up hmmmm
just take it press it oh god oh god
Oh like I messed this one up you press
it oh my god let's you press it and then
you remove that B oh okay let's blow
this one out where's my with my brush
with my brush okay this one's this one's
uh hmm the color scheme on this one is
quite interesting
just say that it's kind of cool though
like this is kind of cool like is it me
or do both the colors at the same maybe
I'm tripping red try the black one but
these look the same they look the same
what the hell okay and instead of blend
this one out as much as the last one I'm
just gonna set it oh god got a hell of
setting powder does do the excess I mean
yeah I don't know I don't know to me if
they kind of just made the upper color a
little bit better this can kind of work
like are you guys see what I'm seeing
like are you seeing the potential I
think that this can kind of work okay so
let's try this black this is the smoky
one and this is called noche ah give my
eye shadow okay let's just do the same
thing I hope this comes out good like
this is black like this is this is legit
oh don't distract me you guys oh just
drag me press it on and then I peel it
off this looks crazy okay I want to
blend it out I'm gonna blend it out to
see like I'm gonna give it a chance okay
I mean this was the craziest at all them
but like I'm gonna blend it out anyway
okay oh car let's see oh my god okay so
wait shut up Linda the black first let
me do that first we blend out the black
first and then I can move in to blend
out the rest wait but that does make
sense cuz we make a whole thing black
okay let me wipe this brush off goodness
Alyssa yo use your mind oh my god do
this other Dalmatian he's calling me om
phone call I actually just hopped on a
phone call for about a good 10 15
minutes so this what I shower looks like
if you don't set it it's very greasy and
it just gets really patchy it's gonna
have to go back in with my brush just
kind of brush over it to fix it be I
want to show you guys that because neat
the setting powder too I mean make it
look okey I mean this one looks terrible
but like oh God like you like finger to
kind of like huh I guess this is just
how this one looks let's go ahead and
set it okay so this one was a
disappointment obviously I was a
Dalmatian but I feel like this one is
pretty nice which one was that one that
was the purple one right this one was
ill I think this one's really nice let
me go ahead and I want
by something so just go take a palette
in the eyeshadow that I have and let's
see
but what shade is this I'm gonna take
like a dark brown and place that on top
I want to see if you can put eyeshadow
on top of it which one looks of it you
can blend it out a little bit so I think
with this one you can kind of build on
it because it's kind of light you know
I'm saying so I don't know I don't want
to I don't know I don't notice it I
don't want to write them off like oh my
god they're trash but at the same time I
mean this one obviously like no but I
don't know I feel like with the lighter
ones you can kind of work with them a
lot and put one on one more time just to
kind of see how it comes out is it humid
come on cools the first one but yeah
whatever I don't care go ahead and slap
some eyeshadow on this one to see how
this comes out okay so I mean I mean I
don't know man like the black one that
was terrible but I just I feel like
these have potential I just wish they
came in different shapes so that they're
not just all plaster onto your eye
because the texture of is actually very
soft and it's not creasing up at all
when you set it with the powder so I
think that part is nice about it and
blending it out and just setting it was
just a cool process because you're not
expecting it to set so well but it did
but I don't know I don't know I think it
can work I think it can work if they
just come up with different shapes for
other eyes stuff for this cuz like what
the hell is this shape like what is this
like Wow
but I don't know I think I see some hope
in it I think I see it
see it you know I see it being cool in
the future but right now it's just can
use a little bit work but I mean I don't
know what do you guys think what would
you guys try it would you guys try it
let me know in the comment section down
below yeah that's it for this video let
me go and wash this off because I'm just
like these are we match but hope you
guys like how this turned out
I mean not the eyes but just a review of
this me trying out something you have
any other prog you want me a tryout just
because comment down down below other
than that thank you so much for watching
