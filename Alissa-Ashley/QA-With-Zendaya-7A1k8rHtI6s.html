so in today's video I mean you guys
already see the title so I won't ramble
I say that now that I probably will
anyway as you can tell by the title
today's video is super exciting if you
guys follow me on Instagram and Twitter
you guys saw this boomerang right here
and you guys you guys freaked out you
guys were like whoa what's happening
right now oh my gosh Alyssa do you see
who you with
I know if you do not follow me on those
medias as you can see with a boomerang I
was able to film with Scindia and I
loves India I was like wow and this is
such a great opportunity it just felt so
natural and I was like heck yeah look
this is so exciting and we actually
filmed a New Year's Eve a makeup
tutorial on her app so I have all the
app information down in the description
bar please check it out because our
looks our slate and I was so fun club
before we even got into the makeup we
actually sat there for like a really
long time and just talked to each other
did a little Q&amp;amp;A a little icebreaker
action and here's where we are today I'm
gonna go ahead and show you guys a
little bit of that to an a on my channel
and the rest of it is gonna be on the
app as well as the makeup tutorial so if
you guys want to check out more of us on
her app be sure to download it and yeah
you guys will be able to see some Q&amp;amp;A
action here on my channel right now so
if you guys are ready for that then just
keep on watching I hope you guys do it
with this whole makeup thing I envision
doing something bigger than I'm doing
now right it's like more like helpful
like I've been thinking about something
just more beneficial in the sense that
like I don't know I might do something
that like includes like all skin types
all skin tones like I'm all for that
so like I don't know I thought about
maybe like creating like a secondary
channel where I get like like a
collective of people yeah and like
whatever product comes out we all like
try it just to make it just like a
one-stop shop so yeah exactly
what's your my lifetime goal that's a
huge question and there's so many things
that I feel like I want to do but I
think my life's I'm going this is gonna
sound super corny and cheesy is to be
happy and that's true for anybody in any
field of work you know is I I wish
people happiness and what they do these
you don't love that you do then what's
the point and I know people like I guess
the Millennial age is like oh you guys
don't want to work you guys don't want
do anything you just want to do we love
exactly it's just something that I think
a lot of people older than us didn't
have the opportunity to do yeah so they
didn't understand it it would either be
Denzel Washington or you know have real
I need you guys a Leo how did I get it
because because you know a you know it's
gonna be an amazing movie you know it's
gonna be amazing movie you know be up
for an Oscar you know that it's gonna be
quality images they're just amazing and
they don't miss because they're just
really out there so I don't mind having
one line let me play their daughter
finesse or something
who is my hero
that's my mom pusher mom she kind of
like gave me the space to be me even
though sometimes me was annoying and bad
but she's still allowed me to be me be
myself so it's like she just kind of
like let me be me and I kind have to
figure out what me was the best me and
now I'm the best me they look you know
you today they're your first teachers
your first you know everything and so I
definitely say my parents
I'd say as far as like someone that
isn't related to me the women in my life
or just like my hair goes you know know
me would it be my grandparents my
grandmother's or whether it be my little
nieces who are in some ways my heroes
because I know that they look up to me
so I have to do stuff and push myself to
be better for them I just think the
women in my life in general I just felt
like that will support that base you
keep it going
morning or night person both really I go
to sleep super late like 2:00 in the
morning I wake up by 6:00 in the morning
no I don't know how I do it I didn't I
just wanted those kind of people you
just can't do that
yeah no no not me waking up today I was
like oh so your night versus totally
favorite huh do you have any other
hobbies besides me Tequesta tasty stuff
not so cool I love taking photos like
eventually I want to do like photography
and if I can forget squeeze in time or
like I love photography video stuff I
think that's gonna be like my next thing
and everyone always always wants like
know like what am i using how do I do it
I take my own photos I got my little
photos sorry okay how do you do that by
yourself so I mean that's my hobby a
hobby I like to say that I do my hobby
for my living which is kind of weird you
know like acting singing is whatever
order whatever like all those things are
like technically a hobby that I happen
to also do is my job as lately I have
been using Korean skincare all right
well I mean I've tried cuz it's like
seven different step sounds okay maybe I
do like to this day and then like I use
its what's called if they're called glow
tonic it's like a little peel pad so I'm
doing that every morning and every night
and my skin's just been like</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
