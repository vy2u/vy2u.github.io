I know it's been like over two weeks
with just freakin yes thank you because
I know it's been over two weeks and a
lot of you guys are probably wondering
Alyssa where the heck did you go some
people speculate that I took a break
because of this the Internet and the
whole honest octave subculture probably
the oldest people just coming at me
false I would never allow myself to
you've ran out the internet okay this is
not a date to me I'm sorry like it
doesn't really affect me to that degree
to the point where I'll leave my loyal
subscribers hanging
I moved that's why I love I moved to LA
from the bay bay to LA and yeah moving
takes quite the toll on you physically
mentally and emotionally especially
moving all alone so it's just been a lot
to keep up and also I'm just trying to
find this balance where I'm paying
attention to myself more I started going
to personal training you know I just
want to care of myself and I also yeah I
need to figure out I take care of myself
while still taking care of my
responsibilities to utilize which is
uploading consistently and not letting
yeah and I'll let you guys go so wrong
any Content so it's just it's a learning
process but I'm super excited to be in
LA I am so happy I the first was scared
but now that I'm here I'm just like my
happy dance I'm just so happy out here
so sorry for keeping you guys waiting
I've been dealing with that and it's
been like fun and crazy and just
stressful but so worth it so but I'm
back spelling now so hope you guys don't
hate me too much today's video is going
to be a really simple look I want to do
something simple because back to school
is back way back to school can't be back
school is back and I know a lot of you
guys who wanted to see something really
nice and simple for back-to-school and
even work so I decided to create this
little simple look I just wanted
something simple because yeah I'm liking
simple lately and I know
to be really nice easy routine to follow
and we all like easy and we all like a
time not so time-consuming routine you
like some that it's time efficient and
that is quick so I decided to create
something just back so if you guys want
to see that and just keep on watching
and yeah hope you enjoy it okay so the
first thing to do is go ahead and
moisturize my face I am using the
origins gen zing energy boosting gel
moisturizer and I'm using this one
because it does really awaken your face
I like to fight that has by and see it
it smells good I'm go ahead and use this
because they keep your links in a week
already
without the magnet next for foundation
I'm gonna go ahead and use a stick
foundation and the reason being is
because a stick is just easier ought to
do is open it up twist it out and then
boom boom boom or loom so with a stick
ish that saving more time because if I
use a little foundation after shake it
pump it out da don get a beauty blender
and blend for my life worse with this I
just apply it I don't know what this
lint is on my babies for my towel
I'm just employ it I'll be sloppy with
it and go ahead and just blend it out
with the brush next we'll go ahead and
roll my stick foundation take a sponge
apply it to the back of the sponge and
I'm going under my eye and a little bit
more detail I'm not gonna wear concealer
I'm just gonna do foundation so I just
wanna make sure that that's all covered
next to go ahead and set everything
you'll go ahead to when makeup
revolution the man power
it's only eight books that old time go
ahead and we're gonna sit that's that
away
and then for the rest of my face like
always we'll keep my store Mike remove
powder now I'm go ahead and do my brows
already brushed them up with a spoolie
then I go ahead and take the la-z-boy
brow or yep I thought was brown boy boy
brow I'm gonna go ahead and apply it to
my brows while that drives down a bit
and we'll go ahead and add some color to
my face I'm using this elf bronze peach
I'm taking it at the contour shade on a
morphine 7 to go back and forth and the
reason why I'm using this is because as
you can see unless you can see it's a
kind of creamy moosie texture so it's a
little bit of natural it's a little too
powdery it's look really nice and glowy
very subtle but still have color also go
ahead and take that blush as well now
that the brows dried down a bit I'm
going to take my benefit to precisely my
brow pencil and I'm just gonna add a
little bit of definition because right
now it looks old but not defined I'm
gonna go ahead and take a little bit of
elf bronzer contour on a more feet in
5:02 and just flush it over my eye area
and then before I apply my mascara and
all that I'm go ahead and just spray my
face to get it refreshment and go ahead
and add some mascara to my top and
bottom lashes
and if this part is optional by doing at
a little subtle highlight I'm gonna take
this Becca and Chrissy Teigan take this
one go over my blush area I'm trying to
go subtle but this is three popping but
it's still gonna be nice and so I'm
using them working in 5:01 to apply this
and nipper lips I'm taking this la girl
lip stick this is their lip apply style
oh one swipe of tinsel creamy color and
this in the shade teddy and you just
roll it up and apply your lips and then
because I want a little more definition
to the powder contour shade and I'm
applying it over the elf one just
because I want to be a minute or more
defined up here my eyes are so small and
this helps them can go ahead and apply
my brows a little bit more alrighty so
here you have the finished look and as
you can see it just looks really simple
and nice and fresh as you can see my
highlight is very subtle my contour
isn't too harsh don't slip it's kind of
like a part of my skin and that is why I
was aiming for the lip color is
overdoing it let's not under doing it as
well so it's kind of putting everything
together the brows are nice but not to
you know precise and all like look like
you spent 30 minutes on it like normally
how eyebrows look it looks to be nice
and simple it looks really nice and
fresh so yeah so yeah so yeah that as
well
18 for us I hope you guys like it hope
it was simple enough to follow along I
hope it was simple enough to use as your
new everyday routine if you're going
toward school or just if you want to
look a little bit done up but not too
done up you just want to like this so
hope you guys like this video and let me
know what else you guys want to see so
I'm back to my film and grind dizzle and
well yeah they're done so other than
that thank you guys so much for watching
