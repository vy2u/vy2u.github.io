say
hey you guys back to my channel so I'm
honestly faking this energy because I
know Han right now because I'm so hungry
I've been literally sitting here since
10:00 the morning freaking filming this
look and I am starving but I am so happy
with how it came out I was inspired
obviously by bees and I just kind of
just want the flow honestly almost got
people I never really have a plan I am
NOT organized whatsoever I just go with
what I'm feeling and I just kind of go
with the brush leaving I can't put this
so hope you guys like it obviously
basically I tell you guys no I'm
entering the NYX face awards this year I
am extremely nervous about it but hey
you know like it does not hurt to try
and you know that's just you know a nice
little life tip it is not her to try
because you never really know if I don't
make it this was still freaking cool
this is cool okay so hope you guys
enjoyed the video I know I've been gone
i stripping it's still tripping but I
just you know took the sacrifice I just
went for it
helped you guys like the video be sure
to comment down below what else to guys
like to see I will be resuming my prom
videos and you know my glamorous stuff
but hope you guys just enjoy everything
in subscribe and do all that cool stuff
that makes me happy makes you happy
because make me and I'll see you guys
soon okay so the first thing we do is
just go ahead and pry my eye
this step is extremely important because
you want to make sure to have a nice
smooth blank base for all of your eye
shadow next I'm gonna go ahead and just
outline these shape before filling it in
and I'm doing this so that I can you
know go and look at my other eye which
is already done just to try to get those
shapes as identical as possible so I'm
going to use a light brown eyeshadow
just to you know create my shape and as
you can see I'm not bringing in all the
way and that's because you know I don't
want to interfere with the yellow later
on next let me go ahead and take my
first eyeshadow and I decided to take my
middle shade first and I'm going to use
this almost like a guideline for my
darker shade and
yellow shade just you know to kind of
blend them into that middle shade that
makes any sense at all and I didn't go
directly in with the black I actually
went in with a dark brown because I feel
like the blend you know would have
looked better and more seamless and now
I'm just quickly popping in my yellow
shadow I'm not gonna focus too much on
it because I will be putting glitter on
it later now to work some of that black
into this look I'm gonna start at the
very end I don't want to start right on
top of the brown you know on the kind of
middle middle right area I want to start
at the very tail of the eye just to kind
of really ease that black into the eye
just to you know give myself some
opportunity to decide how much black I
want in the eye does that make sense I
hope so and then I'm going to take a
blank brush and I'm just going to work
that brush into the black and the brown
just to get a nice ombre and now we're
good now I'm go ahead and step away from
the eyes I want to you know go ahead and
work on the face before applying the
glitter because the glitter does dry and
you know I just didn't want to risk it
you know guinea flaky so I'm going to
use my concealer to sharpen up that wing
I'm go ahead and contour I put my
foundation on by the way so yeah you're
not hallucinating my skin's not heavenly
I just decided to not include that
because it's no not really
educational or anything like that so
i'ma go ahead and just contour and I
really did like this contour product a
whole lot it was like pop and I was like
mmhmm okay now go ahead and just set my
areas in place and I'm essentially doing
everything that I normally do in terms
of you know my regular face makeup and
just make it nice and flawless and just
smooth just like I prepare for my
honeycombs but yeah I'm just going to go
ahead and set everything do some quick
contouring some quick blush and then
move on to the honeycombs
okay so now for the honeycombs fun fact
I'm actually very very scared of holes
so yeah to say that I tried to you know
make them look as realistic as possible
but not too realistic yeah I definitely
did that on purpose because I probably
would have scared myself but I'm taking
a light brown eyeshadow just to create
my little honeycombs I have a picture up
on my phone that I'm looking at just as
a guide and you would think these things
are easy but for me they were struggle
at first thing like Cheerios I was like
oh god Alyssa get it together and now
I'm taking a black cream liner just to
you know darken them and make them look
on nice and defined and then I went
ahead and took a black eyeshadow first
just to create shading and I also took a
brown eyeshadow just to really you know
make it look like it's popping from my
face it looks so creepy but I like it so
I was loving it and I took that same
brown eyeshadow inside of the honeycombs
as well as a yellow eyeshadow now movie
back into the eye imma go ahead and take
a black liner pencil and I'm just going
to put that my waterline but not all the
way in just keep it on the outer and
middle corner I'm gonna set that in
place with some black eyeshadow and I'm
gonna go ahead and take my glitter like
I mentioned I kind of want to do this
step a little bit you know after I did
some other work on my face because it
does dry and I just did not want to
flake i'ma pop out some lashes I tried
to use lashes up when it cover all my
work nothing too dramatic by the same
time still fluttery and sexy now I just
went ahead and took that same glitter I
use on the eyes and I pop that in first
into the honeycombs and I took this gold
you can see I was shaking like a mad dog
but that's cuz I was trying to get to
drip and I thought it would work but
really I just looked crazy and now I'm
going to take that same glitter liner
and pop that onto the upper brow just to
create some detail for the Queen and I
put that underneath the wing as well
next I decided to add more honeycombs
like I mentioned I just kind of go with
the flow and I felt like it would look
really nice traveling down my neck and I
am going to kind of skip a certain part
in this I'm not going to show you guys
where I'm shaded because it's
essentially the same exact thing I did
on my face so I didn't wanna you know
makes you guys time on the same thing
but now I'm just you know gonna drip the
honey and yeah I did out my face but I
mean it looked cool on the neck so I
want to show that anyway moving back
into the eye yes I know I'm all over the
place
i'ma go ahead and just smoke it out just
a little bit this part was a little bit
difficult because my eyes were breaking
out I think I'm having an eczema
breakout so yeah it was a little bit
hard but I did it anyway
now I'm taking some NYX jumbo pencil in
the shade milk one of my favorite
products by them and I'm using this to
really make sure the yellow pops and I'm
going to do the same thing I did in the
inner corner where I apply the yellow
and then the glitter just to match it up
now I'm just gonna speed through this
because it would be extremely boring to
sit here for ten more minutes and watch
me apply this black cream liner onto my
body but that's why I decided to do and
I just felt like you know Abby has black
in it I feel like I was missing some of
that black that I wanted so I decided to
put it all on the body and I'm gonna
drip more honey onto myself as well I
just felt like I needed more honey I
needed it and I kind of went crazy with
it and applied a whole lot but I really
really liked how it came out and then
this will be the final step
and here is the finish look I really
hope you guys like how it came out
it took me so long and I'm so happy with
it and I'm so happy to be entering this
contest wish me luck
wish a girl some luck other than that
thank you so much for watching and I'll
see you guys soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
