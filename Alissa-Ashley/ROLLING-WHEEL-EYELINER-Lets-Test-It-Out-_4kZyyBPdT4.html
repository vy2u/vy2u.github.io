so you're probably wondering Alyssa why
are you so cool says right now and then
because we're doing a video involving
something around the eyes
we're doing a liner test you can tell by
the title is nothing sinful we're going
to be trying to have the sliders day it
is the Mac roller wheel liquid liner I'd
say really slow without a problem
pronouncing my arse and my double uses a
bit tense and I'm going to try not to be
black when I know there's different
little colors I'm into the black one
today and the reason why I want to try
this out is because it is yes it's
definitely a unique eyeliner going to
pop it out and so we're talking you guys
need to let me have my face though it's
okay you guys can understand it's all
good
so here's gonna look like with a duct or
just a product oh it's just just go
ahead and wipe it off okay boom here
glue looks like when you open it up okay
my mother really close out even see it
look a little pizza cutter it's so
interesting
okay I went ahead and put a different
little backing because my hands are too
light but this will look like in its
spin this whole thing spins it's so cool
okay look at that
my little pizza cutter okay clearly I'm
excited now I have yet to watch anyone
else's review because I wanted to give
my own little reaction
Alicia guys oils like on inside as well
here's the inside the product so I guess
the process inside that whole thing a
little secret little tunnel thing it is
kind of there but back to I was saying I
have not watched any reviews I want to
do is give my troopers impression in my
review then go ahead and give it back in
and just coat it with some product and I
guess you can just go ahead and them try
it out I'm really quite interested to
see how you even use this thing but
we're going to try it
we're gonna see I'm gonna go ahead
assume that you go this way with it
because it rolled out so let's go ahead
and try and see Uncle Pete let's see how
this works
so apply some okay so I'm not totally
just fail that's a great thing did not
fail so now I'm gonna go ahead and try
to do the other way which is what I'm
nervous about because I'll say how
they're gonna work let's see how my team
you don't mess up I want to go out a bit
it look normal and decent it's not
really that easy on back you have I just
roll it I was like tagging a complicated
me just roll it across and see what it
does
lift up make sure it's nice and tight
this part we're going to just that's it
okay that's easy all right
refocus hopeful of the glare review so
up sorry but that was pretty easy to
apply to see how it is to fill it in
over here so far so good and I have yet
to get by into the fog so I mean I got a
lot done with just one little
application request it's at one time I'm
a prince I am impressed but let me go
ahead and fill it in this is actually
pretty cool like I'm not alive you
because I thought it would be far
hardness wow I did it I mean the Louie
looks pretty good I mean maximals neat
but I mean I think that from a most part
this is pretty good wing I cannot make a
little bit thicker I don't know if I
should I go let's try get a little bit
bigger because I want to you but just
know that me this is pretty decent and I
feel like this it's muddled is that
okay so how I explained it I feel like
it seems need a bit tricky to really get
the little wheel going on the parts of
the eye to have a little more a little
more skin so I'm going to dip it one
more time and see if it's easier one
more prize I'm okay it's definitely
easier to go eyes more prized on it
which means more confusion
Mixon and it not me that a nasty way to
still make audacity okay so I mean I saw
problems pretty cool I mean is it even
amazing yeah we look pretty good this
one's pretty good
I think this gave me a really nice link
but how easy is going to be to do this
online not so dominant I my right side
with yes
how easy does that need to get to the
other side because that's what's tricky
about liner in general you can't get to
match because one of us or all of us
have one side of the eye that's a little
more easy to do I have my lessons I'm
left-handed so let's go ahead and try
the right side and let's see if we
struggle if we do it's all good you know
we tried we're going to see okay
no I planned longer business up Oh
okay let's just continue as super could
fix it I like this little a prepare for
getting to the inner corner that's one
thing I will mention it into here really
easily and it's getting really close to
the lash line which I like because with
some liners I find that after I do my
liner on my lashes you can still see a
little bit like a space left because I
cannot get the pin in there but this is
getting to the lash line will be very
likely getting it pretty good
pretty damn good I'm impressed by that
I mean is it bad bad
a lot different okay yeah this got team
is up because this link a my love me I
mean from this angle just looked at that
but for my real-life angle it looks a
little funky a painless discolored brush
just to clean this wing up over here
okay at least the problem was pretty
easy to cover and weak it didn't smudge
or smear or creating so a greenness
right there so that is existing so yeah
I mean just even I'm not even sure it
looks pretty feel freedom even I think
okay so I went ahead up slice a mess
scary I wanted to go ahead and give you
guys my little final thoughts on this
wing liner before i zoom back out and
close out this video something you'll be
weird to close it out but half my hair
come but let me go hand is near a little
bit closer you guys okay so I want you
guys to see what I'm seeing to kind of
get a grasp where I'm going to explain
so if you look a little right here and
you can see it doesn't look smooth and
that's because I noticed that the more I
applied product right there it was
getting a little bit dry so that kind of
brings inclusion that you may not want
to polish products up too much which is
usually the case for most liquid liners
like the same consistency you don't want
to keep piling it on because it will be
a little bit crumbly like if I were to
put another layer of this it may crumble
off so there would be mindful of that it
still looks good so let me wrong I just
want to go see Michael don't keep going
over and over again which it may take
maybe two times to get your ring perfect
with this kind of applicator so I just
wanna let you in no do not do it over
and over it makes it may not be the best
also I want to say is this I on this
link it feels a little bit dry so yeah
the formula may be anything in the
picture are which is probably why I'm
kind of seeing where it could
potentially crumble
but overall the wing is really nice in
black and it's very Max wing which I
like a cheap shiny wing liner so yeah
that's kind of what I have to say about
that in terms of the applicator I love
the fact it gets really close to the
lash line because some of us struggle
with that getting really really close so
I think that's so
applicator being that flat kind of pizza
cutter sort of thing it kinda got really
close to lash line which I really
enjoyed about it the most and yeah
overall it seems kind of easy to apply
my wings it didn't seem as hard as I
thought it would be in making a few
practices obviously but I think thought
about three nights it can't really nice
came out really nice what do you guys
think okay so I went ahead and zoom down
just to close out this video because it
would have been weird to close it out
all freakin zoomed in but overall I
think this little wing liner is pretty
cool I'm going to go the toilets when we
talk about it I'm holding you I think
it's pretty cool is it the most
practical if you are on the go
absolutely not
because even I cannae to be really
really slow with it this is definitely
one of those applicators or winged
liners that you use if you're at all I
have to do our winged liner no this
seems more like a really cool type of
liner if you are just kind of into that
kind of thing does that make sense it's
under here to make up you like trying
new products I definitely think that
this is a fun kind of purchase do I see
myself using this every single day no
because the idea can see on this I I
kind of went a little bit too far up so
it is easy to slip up and kind of take
the wing too far too little keep the car
goes Oh in a roll a little bit so it's
not the most practical for everyday the
main things I love about is the fact you
can get close to your lash line so I may
use that for that purpose and just use
my other wing liner to complete the rest
of my wing but I mean overall I'm
getting pretty full product I'm not mad
at I think it's kind of cool uh yeah
that's kind of my verdict on it I know
that like you guys pry our like okay
I've never heard this proxy for Alyssa
so you probably what is going on but I
just wanted to do something fun for you
guys and yes not every single day that a
brand comes out with a winged liner
freaking applicator looks like a pizza
cutter and that looks so intriguing so I
just want to go ahead and give you guys
this quick review
so if you guys liked it be sure to give
it a thumbs up and I will see you guys
in next video hi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
