so I just got done filming a video where
I test it out waterproof flash
long-lasting products and it's probably
re-up by the time up on this video and
today I'm going to show you guys how I
removed all that makeup because as I'm
sure you guys know sometimes waterproof
products can be a little bit tricky to
remove because they're waterproof and
they're meant to stay on your face but
it's not want to get off they just want
to come a resident on your face I'm
going to show you guys how are you
Lucas using the ponds cold cream
cleanser this is the ponds cold cream
cleanser and it will sense me by pause
this video is sponsored by ponds to
review for you guys and show you guys
how it works and then so you guys know
if you do not know I'm going to let you
know whatever I get a sponsorship to use
a product and show you guys it on my
channel I like to try it beforehand to
make sure that I am recommending a
product that is worth your time and
worth your money just having that trust
with you guys look important to me so I
want to make sure you guys know that if
do not know but I've been trying to
supply for about two weeks now but a
week and a half
ish and I am really enjoying it and just
the first little impression when I first
initially tried it I was amazed because
for one area move my makeup so just
effortlessly that's where I'm looking
for and it also did not make my skin
feel stripped of its moisture and that's
where I go wrong with some removing or
make it removing products I was there
moving makeup products sometimes they
just tend to make my skin feel dry and
I'm soaking like Reuther moister comes
the activity but this did not leave me
feeling this way at all and also do not
leave me feel as oily because some may
carry movers compatible a little bit
oily and you just consult a key
you don't feel clean so I just think
that this is a great product because you
remove the makeup and it still allowed
my skin to feel moisturized and I do not
have to go on with a second additional
cleanser to do any cleanup work because
it got rid of all these makeup so for
today's video I'm going to show you guys
how I move my makeup just using this
cold coming closer
and yes I mean snot tutorial but
sometimes I find that therapeutic see if
you remove their makeup so you want to
see me remove my beat and just keep on
watching and hope you guys enjoy this
video
hope that was enjoyable for you guys but
now step by step what you do with this
is you apply the cold cream arm to your
face and a little goes a long way I
actually use a little bit too much and
then you massage it into your skin and
what it does is melts off your makeup as
you can see my makeup is literally just
slipping off of my face it's removing
everything waterproof everything it
removes everything and it removes
everything pretty quickly it takes me
about maybe 2 to 3 minutes if that to
remove everything and then wipe it away
and then once you're done massaging all
that makeup away you're going to take a
warm washcloth and you're just going to
wipe very very easy and you can also use
a cotton around but I only use the con
round if I do not have a lot of makeup
on but I recommend that if you have a
lot on to just make your life easier and
use a washcloth because it's just it's
easier trust me and then activist just
go ahead and follow up with your
moisturizer and then you are all done
hope you guys enjoyed this video if you
decide to try out the ponds cold cream
let me know how it works out for you and
I'll see you guys in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
