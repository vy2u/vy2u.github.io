so for today's video
it's not really anything special like
the look is very simple I mean though
it's really cute look I'm not really
focused too much on the look I'm also
just want to make a video trying out new
products or more so just giving you guys
my thoughts on new products like the
where is it at like the cover of X power
play foundation I use the new maybelline
age rewind concealer in the different
shades I used one of the new shades
because I did add more shades finally
after years I used the Christian
Dominique latte palette and just little
stuff so I just want to go ahead and
just give you guys my thoughts on those
new products because you guys like when
I give you guys my thoughts on new
products so if you guys want to see that
and just keep on watching and hope you
guys enjoy it okay so the first thing
I'm going and do is prime my face lately
I've been using the Too Faced hangover
at three-in-one replenishing primer and
setting spray just because I don't know
I haven't really didn't feeling like
applying a primer first these last
couple days I don't know I just been
spraying so it's just easier for me next
I'm going to take the new cover FX power
play Foundation and I am in the shade in
85 and the way I discovered this is that
I actually took a few and I guess I can
do it now and I'm gonna show you guys so
let me go ahead and dump some out let me
just show you so here's an 85 right
right and then here is carcass which is
my perfect match in the NARS foundation
so they're very very similar see from
this see from this angle they're
SuperDuper similar almost identical the
NARS has a touch like a little bloop of
like a warmer red pigment I'm assuming
but they're very very similar and the
NARS one matches me like perfectly so
that's how I was able to determine that
in 85 is my perfect match it's crazy
because I've used so many cover FX
foundations in the past and I used to
think I was in
seventy-eight thing I was G 70 then I
would not G 80 so yeah basically I
wasn't very close but now I got machine
and if you are not aware this foundation
is actually knew about at Alice's video
and probably won't even be released yet
it actually releases on the 15th and I'm
gonna go ahead and just insert the
swatches I did up the foundations and
explain them to you guys on the screen
because I'm terrible explaining like
verbally because sometimes I mess up but
there are different undertones there's
the peas the ends and the G's so here
are all the swatches and all that good
stuff for you guys because they did send
every single shade this video is not
sponsored by them I actually reached out
and said hey can I review the foundation
because you guys love when I talk about
foundations and just any complexion
products here on my channel so I reached
out to them but let's go ahead and apply
it on her face now and also while we're
here before we put it on I do want to
mention that I actually did a wear test
on this foundation so I'm gonna go ahead
and search some photos because I was
just taking photos throughout the day
and honestly this foundation is so
beautiful and I don't know I feel like
lately brands have been killing it with
foundations there's so many I'm just
like wow like these are also great you
know like because I wore it actually for
my birthday and it looked so smooth
actually it was so smooth that someone
wants to know what primer I use and this
girl comment it saying Photoshop like
okay okay like okay like thank you but
people are so freaking rude for no
reason you know but yeah it looked
really good it looked very good so now
I'm gonna go ahead and just blend this
in I did find that I'd like to blend it
in with the sponge because I tried a
brush and a sponge and I just I like the
sponge I'm just so excited you know
because even like I just felt like I'm
finding like a really good shade and so
many new foundations so I'm just like
yay because I mean I'm telling you guys
I mean you guys have been here I'm
always having to mix foundation shape
with everything everything so the fact
that I am now having foundation options
like I have my NARS I have you know
actual options where I could just take
one bottle and use that and not to mix
it I'm so happy about that because you
know some people are like oh you know
like mixing not that big of a deal it is
a big deal when a foundation is $45 and
you have to buy two bottles because you
have to mix to get your shade like who
wants to do that that's like what over
100 bucks fun so I'm very happy before I
forget this sponge you guys probably
like okay that's a really big Beauty
Blender it's not a be blender I actually
bought a pack of sponges from Amazon
I'll link it in my description bar
because I I want to say it came with
five or four sponges and I really like
them I mean obviously I'm using it and
it's blending really good I like them
okay so here is what we're looking like
here's what it looks like when you do
not set it obviously I'm going to set it
because I want to last well today but I
do want to show you guys the finish
because I feel like back in the day
whenever I would hear the term matte
foundation I would get scared because I
don't know to me old-school matte and
new-school matte is so different
old-school matte was cake face it was
thick it was just like a mask whereas to
me the new matte is still very skin-like
and I appreciate that because yeah I
used to get scared it I know a lot of
people probably still get scared when
they hear matte foundation especially if
you have dry skin I have dry skin so
whenever I hear matte foundation I'm
just like okay I've got to stay with
matte but I mean all these matte
foundations have been working out
beautifully for me because I think that
the new term or the new way that brands
see the word matte is so different and
it's just so much more natural so I
think it looks really good
II know it's matte you can still see
that it looks very skin-like in radiance
I'm on board with that now let's go
ahead and apply some concealer for
concealer I'm gonna use one of the new
maybelline instant age rewind concealer
as you can see I've already used it
because I just I couldn't wait I was
dying to use it and I've been using it
like the last two days and okay let me
just apply it and then you guys will see
this is the shade wears a shade golden
we're gonna let dry down just a little
bit you know do the Jackie and the thing
because I just noticed that whenever I
do allow it to kind of sit a little bit
it blends beautiful and I'm happy that
they added more shades finally because I
actually used to really love this
concealer and I use medium and I main
made me at the time I was a little bit
in denial about the fact that it was too
light but I just like the formulas so
much but I'm glad that they have like
you know other shades now that's amazing
and while we're here can I just mention
that some of these drugstore brands have
been killing it
especially Maybelline talking about you
you guys want to see a pool based
Maybelline let me know because I'm
thinking about it because I want to
start doing more full face of like one
brand
I just never know what brand to do yeah
it definitely blends really nice and
just full coverage and beautiful when
you let it kind of sit a little bit and
then I go ahead and take my makeup
revolution banana powder to set this in
place and what I did is that I actually
mixed in a little bit of the Laura
Mercier translucent powder because I
wanted to come and tone down the banana
E in the banana powder because since
this concealer is definitely more on the
yellow side I do not want my under-eye
to look too yellow especially in photos
and then like always yeah you renew or
if you're new you probably don't know
and if you are new I like to fluff over
my makeup with my Sephora micro smooth
powder in the shade Tam and my morphe 58
because that's how I roll
okay so our base is flawless I'm just
happy to have new foundations that have
amazing shade ranges and that work good
and that look good and like so I'm gonna
go ahead and do my brows off-camera and
then we're gonna do some eye shadow
action on camera I'll be right back now
to go ahead and create this I note I'm
gonna go ahead and use the Kristin
Dominique Lotte palette I will show you
guys to show off pretty it is but I got
a dirty already because I actually use
it a lot so I'm gonna go ahead and I'll
be taking this shade first this shade
second this shade third so those only
three shadows that I'm using or actually
no amazing a little bit of this to to
soften but that's what I'm gonna do to
create this look sooo let's take caramel
now did you guys see it and I actually
have been trying something I mentioned
that I'm trying it because easy here my
channel yet or those all videos I'd
never made it to my channel I've been
trying out the thing where I don't set
my lids after priming them with
concealer because Daisy she had tweeted
saying that works way better she's not
lying it actually works really good it
does it really does
and I find that when I don't set it my
eyes don't feel as dry in the sense that
like I don't know sometimes I feel like
a mate over set with too much powder and
then my shadows don't blend as well so
to her and actually I lied I am NOT
taking hazed or not I'm taking pumpkin
spice which is an orange in the palate
and I'm gonna place that right on top
then I'm gonna go ahead and take double
shot which is the purple and a lot of
you guys are waiting for my video before
you decide to purchase it and I love
this palette I really do find myself
using it in some way almost every single
day because so many of the shades like
the whole top row actually is perfect
for an everyday look and you guys know
me like my nice warm everyday look so I
definitely use it a lot then I'm
switching over to this makeup Shack
brush it's the t53
and I'm going to pack the purple on my
lid and I'm gonna go ahead and apply
some mascara this is my Kiko Milano fall
2.0 mascara
and now I'm gonna go ahead and apply
some lashes and I'm mrs. Vito got a bad
because you guys always want to know
what lashes I'm using but truth be told
I literally have so many that I kind of
just pop them out of the package and
then I just I just don't know they just
kind of lay around so I mean there's so
me that I really know what style or pair
it is look at a bad
but I'm gonna get better okay I'll do
better we're calm - I'm actually gonna
take that Mac in Jeremy Scott collection
because I actually really liked how the
contour looked because of the fact that
it was so subtle and not super warm it
looked really good on camera and
pictures and I'm gonna take this NARS
contour blush and this is Gina just that
very very very lightly so it's very
light see it's SuperDuper intense apply
a little bit and then blew it up I
actually don't have anything new for
blush only open this up I'm gonna take
my little NYX palette and that I ruined
when I scraped out on my brushes and
then because you can never go wrong with
lip gloss I'm just gonna take my bare
minerals what is this
gloss and this is in the shade Meeks
okay so here you have the finished look
and as you guys can see something's
missing I decide that I do not want to
do highlighter today and I mean
sometimes I just feel like I really want
to I don't want to glow so that's one of
those days this is it so that is it for
this look up you guys like how it turned
out and all because just like this
little video of me trying some new
products to give you guys my thoughts on
them because I know that whenever stuff
releases you guys aren't okay listen
what's your thoughts on it what's your
thoughts on it hope you guys enjoyed

a thumbs up and let me know what you
guys want to see next but other than
that thank you guys so much for watching
