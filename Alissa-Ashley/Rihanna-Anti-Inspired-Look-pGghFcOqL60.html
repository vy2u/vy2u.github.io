today's look is going to be a Rihanna
inspired look I already did one before
by really like this one I've been seeing
her little anti diary type little thingy
thing he's and I just got this wig so I
was like hmm I was like let's see what
we can do here and you guys really liked
on Instagram so I decided to make a
video for it it's not gonna be much of a
tutorial it's just gonna be a look you
know really fun so don't forget to
subscribe and let's just jump into it
the first thing would do is apply my
foundation I'm using the coverfx cream
compact pound a pound
foundation put pounds of it on the
foundation and I'm going to buff it into
my skin with my zoeva cosmetics buffer
brush and I'm taking my L'Oreal True
Match concealer and I'm just going to
you know do some concealing and
highlighting and whatnot I'm pretty much
doing everything that I normally do so I
won't talk too much but I'm just gonna
get my face ugly first before focusing
on the eyes so yeah let's just do that
now that I'm done blending out my
contour I'm go ahead and work on setting
those areas in place I'm talking right
now because I want to let you guys know
that I mixed my Sasha Buttercup powder
with my Laura Mercier translucent powder
again I stopped doing it for like a
month and I just went strictly to Sasha
but I did this time actually liked it so
I was okay so I may start doing that
again eyes once let you guys know that
because you know lately in my videos
I've been only doing Sasha so I want to
let you guys know and I kind of tried to
go for a stronger contour for this look
because I feel like her cheekbones are
chiseled as if and cheekbones are gold
so okay let me you know try to slim this
down a little bit
so yeah I'm gonna work on setting
everything that was not talking okay
now on to the brows I'm going to take my
Marc Jacobs brow pencil and honestly for
the brows I didn't even you know snatch
them like that you know I didn't slay
the brows today I just filled them in
very very naturally because well for one
you can't really see Brianna's brows
with the bangs and - I feel like you
know just she keeps her brows pretty
natural so I want to keep my natural and
I'm gonna go ahead and prime my eyes I'm
using the NYX eye base I believe it's
called it's quite new to me so yeah I'm
just gonna blend it out and run it in my
little fingers my fingers look so chubby
because I didn't have nails on because I
bit them all off do not do that okay cuz
they really hurt and I'm going to set
that primary place with some light
translucent powder okay so now that our
brows are done and we are primed we're
going to move on to eyeshadow and just
let you guys know this is a Rihanna
inspired look but the eye isn't exact
and the reason being is because our our
shapes are not the same at all my eyes
are very hooded and they just have much
more skin and they're smaller than hers
so I had to essentially kind of tweak it
up a bit to make it work for my eye
shape I did something similar you know I
just tried to follow you know the
direction of her eyeshadow and the
placement of it but I did have to make
it a little bit different so that's
flattering on my eye shape and I just
wanted to be mindful you know when
you're doing celebrity looks don't feel
like it has to look exact do what works
for you and work for your eye shape does
one time say so yeah I'm just building
on my Browns she really just seemed to
only have brown eye shadows so yeah I'm
just kind of working and adding more
definition and depth on the outer parts
of the eye because it felt like that's
where the focus was so yeah and I'm just
gonna clean up my lid a bit because it
did look like she had a shadow on her
lid
and now I'm just going to pop it some
black eyeshadow on the lash line because
for my reference photo it looked like
the lash line was defined so yeah and
don't worry
all eyes showers and everything I'm
using will be in a description bar like
I mentioned it's not so much a tutorial
I'm just having fun and I want to do
look
okay so now the eyes are done we're
moving on to the face I did some pretty
intense contouring in my opinion I used
benefits hoola bronzer because I wanted
to look this very shadowy and I placed
some light blush on top of that now for
the lips I blanked out my lips using
foundation and a translucent powder and
now I'm just using a really thin winged
liner brush just to kind of create a new
Cupid's bow because I feel like
Rihanna's Cupid's bow is pretty damn
defined so I want to you know emulate
that and try to you know just make my
more defined it wasn't you know meant to
look exactly the same it's just mixed
look define so yeah I'm gonna you know
just do that and I'm going to fill in my
lips I probably doing it the exact lip
color that she had on but I just
followed my reference photo and it
looked like a purple color so I mix two
liquid lipsticks together to get this
shape so yeah I'm just go ahead and fill
in my lips and then after that we are
going to pop on our wig my wig is from
my first wig it's the sister company of
rpgs show and it was bomb I cut it a
little bit and I also cut the veins and
kind of frame my face more but it's
definitely a great wig for beginners
because it's just so easy to wear um
yeah this is the finished look you guys
here's a bunch of slo-moes of me try
looks sexy but if you guys want to see
other inspired looks let me know and
I'll see you guys soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
