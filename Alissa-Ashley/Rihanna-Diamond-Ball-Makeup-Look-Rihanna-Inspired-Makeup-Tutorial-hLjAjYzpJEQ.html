lot of you guys asked me to recreate
Rihanna's diamond ball makeup look so of
course I went ahead and did it it is
super duper easy to achieve I actually
really really loved it and just the
simplicity and the subtle sexiness of
the look so if you want to see how I
achieve this look a Rihanna inspired
look then just keep on watching it's my
first celebrity inspired makeup tutorial
so I'm very excited so yeah don't forget
to subscribe and check the description
bar for all details and codes and let's
jump right into it the first thing I'm
going to do is just prime my skin with
my skin in a via makeup primer spray
this has become a part of my routine now
next I'm going to take my benefit Girl
Meets pearl illuminizer I want to use my
New Jersey Mary won but I couldn't find
it and I found it after filming so it's
like goddamn it now I'm going to apply
my foundation I mixed two foundations
together to get my desired shade they're
both very very high-end so I'm so sorry
about that but I'm just loving this
combination right now and then I'm going
to use my bare minerals bare skin
concealer in the shade tan I usually use
the medium golden one but the tan ones a
little more subtle and I feel like
Rihanna's highlight wasn't super duper
bright and extra it was very subtle so I
want to go with a subtle highlight
now though her highlight was quite
subtle her contour was pretty popping so
I'm going to take my makeup forever
Ultra HD foundation stick in the shade
r53
oh and I'm just going to blend it in
with a damp Beauty Blender and make sure
it's all nice and bronzy I love this
product for contouring it has become my
favorite definitely during the winter
time because in the summer time I didn't
really know how to work with it but now
I feel like I know what I'm doing here
so it's the bomb and then next I'm going
to start setting all that in place I'm
gonna take my Laura Mercier and Sasha
Buttercup powder and I'm going to blend
that into my skin with a dampened sponge
I feel like I like this method a lot
with my under eye area as well as my
forehead because it just allows it to
seep into that area quite nicely and now
I'm going to just set underneath my
contour and create my little beard you
know I do if you watch my tutorials and
if you don't use it because you're
missing out and then I'm going to blend
my beard away either let that cake or
not cake cook today I'm Zebulon it away
and then to make everything look a
little bit more seamless and put
together I'm gonna take my Maybelline
fit me powder and this is the same shade
as my skin tone and I'm just going to
blend it in and I feel like this is a
good tip for you guys if you feel like
your contour and highlight aren't really
seamless just do that and you will see a
difference and now I went ahead and put
some setting powder under my eye to
start on my eye for my brows I'm taking
my benefit browsing in the shade dark
and I'm not going to over draw my brows
today I'm just gonna follow my natural
brow shape and of course extend them and
make them look nice and neat I know
Rihanna's brows aren't really super
dramatic they're nice and natural and
they frame her face very very naturally
so I wanted mine to be the same and I'm
going to conceal them just to clean them
up and now I'm just going to quickly
conceal and prime my eye and then after
I do that I'm going to set it in place
with some powder so I have a nice face
and then I'm going to move into eye
shadow for this look I'll be using the
Inglot rainbow eye shadow number 108 and
as you can see it contains three
different shades of orange so I'll be
using those for the entire look I'll
also be using honest osseous cream soda
orange soda it's a really light of
orange yellow shade just to make sure
everything is nice and soft so yes going
to be doing that and it's very very easy
you just want to build your colors and
then afterwards I'm going to pop on some
Mirage it's a single eyeshadow from
makeup geek on my brow bone to get a
nice pop and brow bone that Rihanna has
and then I'm going to just quickly
conceal my lid just to make it a little
bit more clean and I'm going to pop
Mirage right on top of that and then
that'll be pretty much the eye shadow
complete for now next I'm going to add
my wing at first I made the wing very
very small but I end up going over it
later and kind of flicking out just a
bit because I did see a close-up photo
and she did have a nice subtle but you
know flipped out wing and I'm going to
apply some lashes I took these lashes
from new bounce um and then the style
Bella but I cut them so that it looks
like the outer corners or more fluttery
and then for the bottom part of the eye
I wasn't entirely sure what's going on
there because some people of course
probably edited the photo so it looked
darker in some images and lighter and
other images I decided to go with a
quick black liner in my waterline and
then smoke it out very lightly with some
brown eyeshadow and then I went ahead of
course pop out some mascara underneath
there because her lashes were nice and
fluttery and then I noticed the I sha
was slightly rounded up on the outer
corners so I went ahead and did that to
finish off the eye now to finish off the
look imma go ahead and finish up your
face I'm going to really get a nice
sharp fleeky contour with my Too Faced
dark chocolate Soleil bronzer I notice
that her contour is very very sharp so I
want to achieve that it was my excuse to
have a nice popping contour because
usually I try to make it a little
so sometimes it fails sometimes it
doesn't fail but I want a mind to be
nice and sharp like hers and I'll go
ahead and kind of contour my nose just a
little bit just to make it look a little
bit smaller and then for blush I'm going
to take Mac raisin blush because I feel
like out of all the blushes I own it is
the most similar to the blush that she
had on in the photos and then I'm gonna
go ahead and flick out my wing like I
mentioned earlier just because I looked
at another reference photo and I noticed
that her wing was much more dominant in
the look and in reference pose I also
noticed that she had a pop-up highlight
on the inner corner at first I didn't
know how I was going to achieve that
because I don't really have you know
that tear duct area so I decided to put
it on that extra flap or my nose you
know so where that area is it's hard to
explain it's just that extra skin and I
actually really really liked it so I'm
probably not try it out again very soon
and I also noticed that she didn't
really have highlights she had more of
an a kind of luminous luminosity to the
skin
so I took my Kevin Kwan central skin
enhancer and just pounced that on the
high points of my face I took this one
because it's very very subtle and not
SuperDuper shiny for the lips
I took a Mac verb lipstick because I
feel like her lip color was a very
subtle pink shade and it wasn't you know
too pink or to purple or to anything and
if like verb is the perfect shade and
then I popped on anastasi as undressed
lip gloss right in the center because I
feel like it was lighter in the center
part of her lips and it's actually a
really really pretty lip combo and now
to finish off the look I'm just going to
set my face in place with Scandinavia's
makeup setting spray and then I'm gonna
let that air dry and fan it and out pop
in my wig and then that will be the
finished look I really really hope you
