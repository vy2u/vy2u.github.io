in today's video I'm going to be
breaking down what I do to achieve my
platinum blonde hair you guys I can't
see that much but it's kind of being
yellow so now's the perfect time for me
to touch it up so I'm gonna go ahead and
just go through what I do I am quite B
I'm quite obsessive over it so whenever
it sees like whenever I see a little bit
of yellow I don't like it and I can see
some yellow so I'm gonna go ahead and
show you guys what I do to get rid of
that yellow as much as I can now I'm not
a professional but I mean I think that I
do a pretty decent job so if you trust
me that you can go ahead and follow what
I'm doing also I'm gonna show you guys
how I styled my hair because a lot of
people expressed to me that they cut
their hair because of me so you guys
need to know what to do to style it like
me so if you guys want to see them and
just keep on watching
and yeah let's go ahead and get started
okay so my first step we're gonna go
ahead and bleach my hair bleaching it
cuz my groups are kind of growing in and
they're a little bit more yellow than
the rest of my hair so I'm gonna go
ahead and bleach them because this is
just a part of my process you don't have
to bleach at this stage if you do not
want to but I I like my hair to be like
as even as possible of my roots are kind
of shellings I want to get rid of those
for Bleach I've been using the ion color
brilliance bright white cream blinder
and you gets you eight levels of lift
and I've switched over to cream bleach I
don't know I just like the way it works
better and yeah it doesn't feel as
damaging on the hair as powder bleach
I'm not sure if like it's proven to be
better for your hair but for me
personally I've noticed a difference it
doesn't get as dry so I go I'd use my
cream later today and forever now that
I've discovered it I guess for a while I
did not even know they make cream
bleaches ah okay I'm running low so I
may go and use both hands to squeeze out
some bleach and then since I dye my hair
a lot I have this huge 30 volume
developer and this is from Milan as well
and it'll go ahead and just pour it and
mix up my mixture okay so now I have my
bleach nice and blended and smooth and
now I'm gonna go ahead and add some
olaplex to it now unfortunately if you
not have your
licensed you cannot even buy this I
don't have my license I don't look so I
mean if you can find a plug by all means
but I'm adding this because yeah if you
just just school olaplex it's helpful
and pretty sure there's alternatives to
olaplex you can use and get your hands
on but I got a plug so I got the good
stuffs I'm gonna go ahead and mix it
into my bleach okay so that's mixed in
and I'm gonna go ahead and just go
through my hair with this comb like this
comb because it's a rat tail comb so
just give me really nice and in there
and I'm gonna go ahead and just put the
bleach onto my roots I don't really need
to bleach too much of my actual hair
because that's just adding unnecessary
damage but I just want to get my roots
because my roots are more yellow than
the ends of my hair so I'm gonna go
ahead and just put this bleach into my
hair I said hair a lot of times
so once I'm done with that I'm gonna go
ahead and let this sit in my hair I'm
gonna monitor it usually it takes about
20 minutes if that I'm gonna monitor it
because I do not want to over process it
and then I'll be right back
I'll get back I look crazy okay so it's
been about 20 minutes and my hair looks
to be as light as it's gonna get it's
still yellow but it's as light as it's
gonna go it's lift it to whatever it's
gonna be so I'm gonna go ahead and rinse
this out
and shampoo a little bit I like to use
my shampoo where's that I like to use
this shampoo right here it's from Apple
G or Apple G and it is the keratin and
green tea shampoo so I use this to
shampoo so I'm go ahead and just lightly
do that and I'll be right back okay so
the bleach has been rinsed out and as
you can see my hair it looks kind of
stringy and like kind of straight and in
the beginning it was curly but do not
worry my hair is fine it does this every
single time and the curl pattern comes
back because I take care of it but yeah
I don't just like do this and freak out
like oh my god my curls are gone no I
think it's just got like a natural
reaction when you freakin bleach your
hair but do not worry my curls be back
now I'm gonna go ahead and tone my hair
that is my next step and I'm not gonna
use a mixing bowl because I do not have
another one I'm just gonna use my
resources use a good old cup and this is
actually kind of better if I just throw
it away instead of rinsing it out
anywho the toner that I love to use that
I always gravitate towards because I've
tried mini is the wellin t18 toner it's
the best one in my opinion for a white
hair it just yes works the best so I'm
gonna go ahead and use this and
going to use the Wella cream developer
and this is in volume 20 so I'm going to
mix up my mixture and be right back and
then just like my bleach imma go ahead
and add some olaplex just to kind of
help minimize the damage
now the toner is in i'ma go ahead and
leave this in for about a good 15
minutes while monitoring it to make sure
I don't over tone even though honestly
speaking I prefer to overtone than under
tell them because those are my undertone
I still have a lot of yellow but if I
overtone I may have a little bit of a
purple tint but I can just bleach that
out I could just hit it with bleach and
then it will go away so yeah I'm gonna
go ahead and just let it let it sit and
I will be right back once I feel like it
is ready to come out okay so this toner
has been sitting and I've had like wipe
the edges because adding the old look
like something a little more liquidy so
I'm gonna go ahead and rinse this out
and we are back like always
okay so as you can see like I mentioned
I over tone it a little bit but it is
okay I'm going to take the remainder of
my bleach and I'm literally gonna just
slap it right on top and that's the
reason why I pull my hair to the front
because as you can see really only the
ends of my hair like the main part not
the roots got purple so I tend to brush
over the roots and knots not the roots I
need to brush it over the ends of my
hair and not so much the roots so it's
just easier to brush it in front and
then hit it with some bleach just a
little bit okay so I'm going to go ahead
and leave this bleach you've heard about
a good two to three minutes
nothing over that and then I'll be right
back I'm gonna go ahead and take some
shampoo and just a lot of this up and
rinse it out and then move on to our
next step
but now this is ready to come out so go
ahead and quickly rinse this out okay
now I've got that shampooed my going to
take this ion intense moisture
conditioner I'm gonna go ahead and just
really get this in my head I took too
much but yeah basically I'm going to yes
let this just really sit in my hair I'm
applying a lot because I want my hair to
be nice and moisturized conditioned
because I just did a lot of damage to it
for like you know green bleaching yeah
bleach it was damaging so and tell me to
so I'm go ahead and just make sure to
decondition I'll be right back they let
this sit about 30
minutes and we're gonna rinse it out
okay so now my hair is nice and white as
them get because I mean obviously I
probably can tell like one more time to
get the roots one more time but is I
mean it looks okay it's not super yellow
and as long as the majority of my hair
is white I'm okay I don't want to overdo
it you know I mean so now it's time for
styling the first thing we do is go
ahead and take those can't - shea butter
coconut curling cream the tops on the
Florham - Leda to get it and I'll go
ahead and take like about a nail love it
one nail and I'm just going to do this
just like that and the reason I do that
is because what the amount of gel I put
in my hair sometimes the gel how I
explain it
it'll penetrate my I don't know how to
explain it
I'll explain that I'm gonna do one more
for the back if basically adding this it
I might explain it let me go ahead and
style and I'll explain it at my style
because they'll probably come to me then
I'm not I do it but as you can see I'm
pushing my hair upward that's a reason
why deconditioning with it going upwards
because it's gonna be easier in terms of
styling because this part swoop this way
so just a little easy little trick that
you can do to make life easier for
yourself next I'm taking my beloved
brush that needs to be cleaned
I've had this brush Bradley sick in two
years something like that something
crazy this is my homie this is brush for
a name it which we named the brush we
leave it mmm we don't have name for her
yet but this is the homie what brand is
this she's no brand okay
probably from Walmart probably Walmart
and then I'm gonna take my big ol thing
that eco style Jill I like or eco styler
not style I like this gel this specific
gel because it's clear if I use the
green base one I used to it adds yellow
tint if I use any other one it adds
yellow tint this is clear so it's not
going to impact the color of my hair
obviously I can't use brown gel because
I mean what do you think that's gonna do
so I like to stick to clear gel and this
one's my favorite which is what I have a
huge one now I used to just take
brush and dip it in but I'm actually not
takes on my hand as you can see and we
are going to basically Pat it into the
hair just to get it on the hair because
I find that this little method makes a
lay flatter because it's going to
penetrate more of the warm the hair than
just the top layer because sometimes
when I just do the brush method I just
dip it it doesn't get really nice and in
there so I'm gonna go ahead and just use
that put it in the hair I'm saying the
hair like it's not mine I'm go ahead and
take my brush and I'm going to begin
sweeping it down this part here is
pretty easy and okay as you can see
you're getting nice white and that's why
I added the conditioner because the
conditioner is kind of white so when I
gel it down it just looks more popping
because whenever I don't add a
conditioner sometimes the blonde it
blends into my scalp because my scalp is
light and you don't really get this pop
and white that you see right now so
that's a great tip for you so I'm just I
continue to brush this part down I
usually do this side first because I
have to do a part on the side so I kind
just finesse over here to see how much
I'm gonna suit this way went ahead and
did my part and all I did was just do
that I'm not gonna do it over kind of
mess it up and I'm going to work on
scoop it down this side it's not perfect
yet I'm just kind of getting it brush
down as much as possible first and then
the back
I don't you guys probably see but it's
not flat oh it went blurry you guys
didn't see that but basically I'm gonna
take a comb and I'm just going to use
the comb to get as flat as possible
because my curls do kind of try to like
stick up if it's not like you know
smooth so I'm using a comb to go through
it to smooth it down oh yeah okay now
it's looking pretty flat I went ahead
and dipped into my gel and on this part
here this part seems to try to stick up
the most so I'm just taking gel in the
area that tries to stick up the most
go ahead and just brush this part down
it's hard to do got out of mirror but
then I'll go ahead and look in that
mirror and fix it if I need to and then
even with all this Jill you'd be shocked
because my hair it'll still try curl up
as it dries sue I've learned to add a
little bit got to be glued and this is
the styling spiking blue unless he
sparkling I'm making a little bit of
that well about this much and I'm gonna
get it nice in my hand I'm gonna sweep
across my hair and I'm gonna brush it in
with a brush
I'm mainly focusing on that part of the
hair because this part tends to try to
curl up I take my brush and just sweep
that in I'm gonna go ahead and say go
toothbrush take a little bit more of
that got to be glued just put a little
bit on the brush I'm gonna use this for
this part right here because I just want
to get in really detail because I mean
of course I got into it with the brush I
didn't get into it the breastfeeding
white but I got in that year with the
brush if I just want to make sure that
it's really nice and slick laid look at
my monitor right now feeling myself and
then honestly that is it we are late as
hell
we're lead me I'm late till finish and
that is it and honestly speaking I don't
even have to put a scarf on I won't do
anything because using that got to be
glued to save my life it really hardens
it in a way that makes your last on day
but that's the point where you're
feeling like oh my god I have like a
brick on my head so yeah I mean that's
it
that's me so after this you would
proceed to slam your face you know that
good stuff and then you'll be good to go
and I mean naturally you want to wash
your hands cuz mines are really sticky
right now but that is it for this video
so I showed you guys how I got the color
and I showed you guys how late the hair
I keep looking at it so nice video so
hope you guys found this to be helpful
if you did be sure to give it a big
thumbs up
that is all that's all I have for you
for this video on my hair and yeah thank
you guys for watching and I will see you
guys in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
