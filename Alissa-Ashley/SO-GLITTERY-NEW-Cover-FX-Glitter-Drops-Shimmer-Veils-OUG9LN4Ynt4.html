for today's video I literally just got
these in the mail and I was like with it
because I have to watch the mouth like
oh my goodness I'm going to be using the
new cover FX glitter drops and shimmer
heels just to create this lip that you
see right here and I just kind of want
to have some fun I decided to do a nice
little pastel kind of action look we got
some purples we got some blues and you
guys want to know what those colors
remind me of they remind me of two of
the themes in the game best fiends and
they are sponsoring this video best
fiends is a gaming app it's a venture
gaming app where you're able to collect
the fiends and you match same colored
objects to defeat the slugs and this
month if you play you can participate in
the winter challenge and you can win
some pretty cool prizes like winning a
new character best fiends is a free app
and you can play it without Wi-Fi do not
need no Wi-Fi to play the game and get
addicted like me so if you guys want to
check it out be sure to check my
description bar for all the details and
downloading the game I'll have it all
linked down there so you guys can play
it as well and let me know you guys
thoughts on the game I'm sure most of
you are you play it because we always
talk about here on YouTube
we love our best fiends but that is it
for my little sponsor thank you for
sponsoring the video best fiends again
if you guys want to see how I achieve
this look then just keep on watching and
I hope you guys enjoy it
the first thing I do is take glitter
drops and this is the shade lunar it's a
nice kind of bluish glitter it has like
purple hints it's so hard to describe
but it's so magical and I want to swatch
it for you guys I'm gonna take a
blending brush and I'm gonna apply this
as the base I know may be weird to apply
a glitter base but I almost want the
shadow to like shine from like
underneath if that makes any sense at
all
so that's why I did that and I might let
it dry and then dipping into the dose of
colors ice cream palette I'm gonna take
this lavender shade and I'm gonna apply
it all on top doing this gave my eye a
nice kind of lavender Sheen because it
mixed with the glitter so it just looked
really pretty and then on the outer
parts of the eye
apply a purple shade just because I
wanted my eyes to have some dimension
and just like not just a one toned look
because I just don't know I like how it
looks this way and then I took mint chip
from the dose of colors palette and I'm
applying that to the inner part of the
eye to make that part really pop and
more shimmery here next I'm taking these
shimmer reveals and I'm taking the
shades halo and amethyst I mix them on
the back of my hand and I'm just gonna
apply that on top as well just to just
add even more dimension this looks so
good in photos and then you want to make
sure that dries so you get no creasing
and this lasted a pretty pretty nice
time it didn't like smudge or anything
throughout the whole day I'll insert
photos and then I'm taking a purple
shape and the dose of colors palette
just to finish off the bottom part of
the eye I'm not gonna do shimmer on the
bottom just macked to finish off the
eyes I'm gonna apply some mascara no
lashes for me today because I really
want the focus to be on the eye shadow
and lashes may have overpower that and
that'll be the eyes done now I'm gonna
finish off the rest of my face I'm gonna
go ahead and just bronze a little bit
give myself some color and I'm using my
chanel natural glows your color stuff
that I always use and then I'm gonna
apply a violet blush because I felt this
looked great with the eyes I applied too
much a little bit so I had to kind of
tone it down but as long as we have a
violet factor we're good to go for this
next step I'm gonna show you guys how to
apply the glitter drops to your face an
effective way without looking crazy
first you want to do my little step
where I apply my ELF daily hydration
moisturizer to the parts we're gonna
apply the highlight next you want to
take the remaining lotion on the back of
your hand and mix in some of the drops
I'm using the shade Aurora and I'm gonna
mix it together and you want to make
sure it's nice and mixed and I mixed it
with the lotion because it's gonna apply
easier and it's gonna be less glittery
these are glitter drops so it's super
glittery but the lotion kind of toned it
down and made it a little more wearable
for the face in my opinion so I'm gonna
go ahead and apply this with my Tarte
quickie blending sponge and I'm add some
more and this time mixing my blue
glitter filled I use earlier just to
really match
the eyes but just make sure you blend
this really nicely and apply it very
gradually you don't want to just go boom
and put on your face otherwise it's
gonna look a bit and then after we're
done applying that we're gonna be extra
and we're gonna mix up some more but
just in a bigger supply and we're gonna
apply this to my shoulders you don't
have to do this
I'll just being extra and I want to see
how I look so that's what I did and I
ended up being very glittery but don't
worry it washes off very easily all you
need is water but it looked gorgeous on
the skin so I was not mad at it and it
looked yeah it looked really pretty okay
next for lip color I'm gonna apply a
really simple lip stick this is just a
nice neutral pink and I want this to be
a really nice hydrating formula so that
way our shim reveal glides on easily and
this is amethyst shimmer ville because I
like the purple tint to it and then on
top of that for an extra kick I add
lunar glitter drops just because I was
just I was going off for it I want to be
glittery in this end up looking very
pretty it was more subtle than I expect
it to be because I thought was gonna be
boom but I really liked it and then
lastly I'm gonna go ahead and set my
entire face in place and then here you
have the finished glittery shimmer look
hope you guys like how it turned out if
you guys did be sure to give this video
a thumbs up and let me know are you guys

them other than that thank you guys so
much for watching and I'll see you guys
