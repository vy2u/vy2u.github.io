for today's video I decide to film a
graduation makeup tutorial I did
something nice and soft I tried to use
products that will last throughout the
night or evening whenever your
graduation is daytime outside indoor
crying I tried to make sure to use
products that will last and I also try
to make sure use products that are
affordable because if you're graduating
then most likely you want to save your
coins i whatever looking you're gonna be
doing because you know you know I don't
want to talk too much in my intro
because it's gonna be a talker video so
yeah I'll see you guys soon and help you
guys enjoy let's get tutorial okay so
the first thing we do is you go ahead
and cleanse my skin um I actually just
got at my boyfriend's house so yeah I
didn't get to on my face so I'm gonna go
ahead and do that I'm using my purity
one-step facial cleanser and my vanity
planet ultimate skin spot system go
ahead and cleanse and exfoliate have a
little pimple right here so I need to do
this go ahead and drive my face the
brows gone and now I'm going to take
this Olay Olay Henriksen I think it's
called it's the truth cream advanced
hydration it's new to me I don't let the
fact I kind of like build up on the
edges but the great moisturizer so I'm
feeling it was like 45 bucks I think
that's for thanks for go ahead and prime
my skin with the skins and navy and
makeup primer spray using the oil
control as you can see it here it's kind
of running out he'll use a regular one
kind of more though
oh god the bowl burning out no firm
foundation I'm taking the car effects
nap natural natural finish foundation
I'm going to squeeze a little bit on my
hand the back of my hand I'm gonna dab
onto my face now I'm building out my
Beauty Blender
so I just realized that the last two
proxies we're kind of on the higher
inside so I'm going to tone it down a
notch because is graduation and I'm
going to try to use some more affordable
stuff so for concealer today I'm using
the Loreal new oh it's new L'Oreal True
Match super blendable concealer in these
shades in 4-5 highlight with that it's
one my favorite drugstore concealers
they get a little bit nose contouring
the hell's Kat down a blade I would be
lender next time take my Maybelline
shine-free powder just to set everything
in place I see some crease in a little
bit so let me go ahead lend those out
and quickly set
I'm actually do a little bit of baking
and I'm take the same powder and just
place on you in my eyes and it's gonna
brighten and all the other good things
that bacon does for us to contract
aching my Black Radiance soft focus
finishing products in the shade milk
chocolate I'm taking my zoeva won 2-6
looks cheap finish brush just apply this
this powder is very pigmented so I make
sure adjust the excess you know so you
don't get too much of a strong contour
eye contour so strong but whatever it's
gonna look nice so and then for my nose
contour take my morphe in five to four
brush in a same powder
okay so I already did one eye off-camera
nominal headstrong other not going to
zoom in because it's very very very
simple so go ahead and take my auto
stocks a dipper I didn't get more today
because yeah I need more and this is the
makeup addiction angled brow brush and
of course you want to make sure to set
your brow in place and use the Anastacio
clear brow gel to do that let me go
ahead and clean it on my brow use my mac
studio finish concealer like always
actually the pretty neat today so i
don't want to need to clean them up i'm
you use concealer to prime so got to put
it on anyway any red handle brush you
see i use it some juvies please here's
another one go ahead and blend that out
i'm take that maybelline shine free
power just set for i shall see i'm use
two pallets or the new morphe palette
and try to show them one by one because
i've been trapped on the both same time
it's a fail so here is this one this is
the 3500m formats it's really nice and
then here is the 35 OS for shimmers okay
so first take the matte palette for my
crease area i'm going to take this shade
right here this nice kind of transition
shade places all in my crease
I'm going to take this shade right here
it's a nice soft shape too but it has
some kind of pop tool because it's more
on the bright side that makes any sense
go over lay that on top of that another
shape we just did and I'm gonna take
this shade and this shade is a nice kind
of reddish brown cheaters bump in and
I'm trying to use you know as least
brushes as possible so just make it
easier I'm doin lay it just place that
right on top i mighta carried up as much
and then we have switch brush to the
morphe dat brush and i got take this
nice brown shades nice chocolate shade
it's not too deep that's saying I'm
Steeve enough too deep deep enough to
really kind of define the crease area so
that's why once you use that one now I'm
going to switch over to the 35s palette
I'm going to take the 2 to 6 smudger
brush by zoeva and I take my Mac mixing
medium liner and place it all over my
lid it's just a little bit of a shell
that I used on it that's okay and then I
don't look up I'm going to take this
shimmery shade pimpy it this nice kind
of champagne shade right here now go
ahead and create a wing using the morphe
slate gel liner okay so for mascara I'm
using benefits they're real mascara I
don't think it has any claims of being
waterproof however it is waterproof as
hell use that one because it's the only
thing that I have that's close to
waterproof for last I'm going to take my
thrive Cosmetics infinity lash adhesive
this the only left glide use and I'm
going to take Coco lash in the style
goddess and wait for the glue to dry and
I
like their lashes the band is a little
bit thick and I also don't like that
they don't really respond to people and
their comments on the page I don't like
that Koko lashes like people acts oh we
can get them and I never see Ben respond
so I sounds a little bit weird but yeah
it from the bottom half and take my
zoeva to 3/7 detail shader brush and I'm
going to take this car right here the
one it has somewhat of a pop out
something on me okay I might ignore that
right now I'm place this really close to
the lash line not smoking it out I'm not
gonna have too much for the inner corner
my take away girls you let out a glow
glide gel liner this is the white it's
called whitening and placed on the inner
corner I'm going to take the same color
that I used on my lid and place on in a
corner for blush I'm taking my ELF blush
palette and I don't know which one I
want to take then we take the lighter
shade just kind of see how I feel about
it first all right that didn't show up
so I'm gonna take this one down here all
right that one's showing up not for high
I decided to take Mac soft and gentle
and not to say that it's affordable but
it's easier to kind of get your hands on
some other highlights I own so I'm just
going to take that place it right there
a little bit in center of the nose
and a little bit on the Cupid's bow and
then from lips I think it's best to wear
a liquid lipstick soca lasts longer so
I'm going to take my kiss New York roots
the coffee lip pencil and everyone
always asks where I get them I get to
the beeswax or it's 1zz
and I'm taking color props beeper a
liquid lipstick and last time I do just
set everything in place with my skin
today be a finishing spray this is the
oil control so here is the finished look
I really hope you guys like it
I tried aim for something nice and soft
and honestly you can wear this anywhere
you want but this is what I would wear
for my graduate hope you guys enjoyed

subscribe I want to hit 200,000 bite you
