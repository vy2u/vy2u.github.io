today's video is going to be on this
look that you see right here I wanted to
do something that included faux freckles
because you guys really like how mine
turned out what was at the peach video
you guys really liked that and I also
want to do something that kind of had a
grungy feel to it so I kind of some
smokey Brown and I just kind of just
kind of played I kind of just kind of
just kind of I just played I just played
with what I was feeling and vibing on
and I want to create something very like
just like this this is what I want to
create so that's why I created goddamnit
so this is what you get today um yeah
that is it for the explanation on this
look do not forget to subscribe because
yeah that's important this is how you do
it I don't know why people are saying
they're getting and subscribe to my
channel so now I have to verbally tell
you guys subscribe and every video which
I did not want to do that's annoying but
go ahead and subscribe you haven't
already and make sure that your
notifications are turned on for my
videos because some of the notifications
get turned off I don't know what's going
on with YouTube but just make sure you
subscribe and you get notified if you
want to and we're all good
so yeah let's go ahead and just jump
into this tutorial I hope you guys enjoy
do it enjoy the dude just enjoy the
tutorial it's okay sorry I have my
foundation on because I just want to
kind of skip a step to make video
shorter but the first official thing I'm
going to do is go ahead and take this
eco brow in the shade Rita and this is
their defining wax and go ahead and
create this kind of bushy straight kind
of brow I want to go with this kind of
look today and this is the brow gal what
is this the angled brush yeah it's just
a raw brush I think go ahead and make
hair like strokes with this wax and as
opposed to curving it downwards I'm
going to keep it straight when doing
this try not to use the spoolie end as
much because all it's going to do is
move around the wax and they give it a
little defining little strokes and if
some of these strokes are a little bit
more pigment in the other that's
perfectly okay because as you can see
it's creating a texture
I'm gonna go ahead and take a little bit
concealer just to clean it up a bit next
time take this Aiko brow gel go ahead
and just apply a little bit and it's
tinted which is why I'm using this let
me go ahead and set it with my honest
hacia clear brow gel because the ICO
doesn't really set it the hair still
move I found with that Jill so I want to
go ahead and make sure that it's nice
and in place now go ahead and take some
more concealer and just use that to
smooth all over my eye just to make it
nice and even
go ahead and lightly set it with some
powder and now I'm going to take my eco
brow may use as a base today it's very
thin and then directly on top of that
instead of use an eye shadow I'm going
to take my Sephora micro smooth powder I
decided to do this because it's close to
my skin tone and I just kind of want the
look to look very just natural as
natural as possible go ahead and fix
that a little bit I saw a little mistake
then go ahead and set it in place next
we'll go ahead and take this you a matte
brown slim cream eyeliner go ahead and
pop this into my lash line
and then after that I may go ahead and
take the matte black when it plays on
the outer corner and as you can see I'm
kind of making the liner a little bit
low and that's what I want now before we
continue the eyes we gotta go ahead and
do the rest of the face because we're
gonna do some stuff under here so I'm
going to take my NARS radiant creamy
concealer in this in the shade biscuit
use this under my eye just to highlight
also go ahead and just highlight the
middle of my nose you guys never really
seen me do any kind of nose concealing
highlight I would do it today because I
know that look at the foundation I've
been freaking moving because of the faux
freckles as I make sure that my nose
still gets its shine
I'm going to go ahead and quickly set my
under eyes in place with some lower
Mercier powder and then for the rest of
my face and we use my Sephora micro
smooth powder and this is the morphe y
one it makes it a little RSA to scare
all over my hand I have my scare like
all over my hand Wow oops anyways let me
go ahead and take that brown pencil and
smudge it all underneath my eye then
quickly taking this Inglot 9's brush to
make sure I have nice smooth edges now
taking some of that NARS contour blush
shade just to smoke it out very softly
I'm also take the brown and place a
little bit up top as well just on the
outer part and use my finger just to
kind of smoke it out a little bit but I
want that to be very faint I'm gonna
take this it cosmetics superhero mascara
and just coat my bottom lashes
let's go ahead and warm up the face I'm
kind of jumping around because I don't
really know I'm creating by no I have a
vision so we're going to go ahead and
jump around do the other stuff what
we're kind of like thinking a little bit
I'm going to take this two-faced dark
chocolate Soleil bronzer because I used
in my piece tutorial and I can't put it
down and this is a morphe for brush cuts
which is my morphe m-52 for my nose for
blush first I'm take a little bit of
mega peeks summer nap summer fling
places on fling puppy love
kind of kind just sweep it just a little
bit going upwards motion becomes I give
myself around like a I dropped it a
longer kind of hold on I gotta pick it
up try get myself more like kind of look
that means instance at all
I don't know the boob is we doing the
bloop do the bloop bloop okay I'm
stopping now and if my full freckles I
went ahead and did a little bit over
here because want to make sure that this
tool that I use other time is still like
legit and this is the a tude house tint
to my brows it's for the brows but the
most similar thing that you can get
because this took a little while because
I got on Amazon but it's like from like
China or something you could use the Kat
Von D eyebrow pin to do this too because
it's the same thing I'm just gonna go
ahead and just kind of create little
dots very very light hand with this I'm
just going to place them randomly and I
like this pen because it's kind of brown
but it's a cool toned Brown so you're
not getting too much warmth and I think
that the warmth can add a little bit
more I feel like when the freckles are
too warm just leave your faux they look
more faux some people obviously have
more warm freckles but what I'm trying
to say is that this kind of lends to my
skin more and looks more natural because
not
like reddish it's more of a coolie
undertone the neutral and under like I
do what it's kind of like flatten them
with my finger and if I do this and I
have the amount of freckles I want I'm
gonna take my Sephora microscope powder
and just kind of go over it very lightly
and it's my highlight I want something
that's gonna okay you see I'm looking
right now there's highlight on this side
and you probably can't you probably
would have no unless I told you that was
there but this was that turn over here
you can see it but basically what I'm
trying to say is I want it that's more
subtle and just kind of more into the
skin if that makes any sense at all so
take my morphe Y 14 and this is the Dior
Deora skin nude air Luminizer it's very
expensive but I like it because the
formulation is very sheer and not super
like BAM in your face unless you want to
be so I'm just go ahead and just kind of
smooth this on my high points but I want
to just kind of like seep to the skin
and that's what this highlight does
therefore my nose I'm going to put it
right on the tip for lashes I want to
say these are mood lashes and style
Miami and I just cut them down a
preacher they are by 90 percent and a
lot of you guys are actually one lash
glue I use in my last video and it is
the callous yeah callous eyelash
adhesive and I got it from Nene's in LA
because a list of our community so I
like it be good I got the clear one and
the dark one I use a clear more and then
because these lashes are kind of
dramatic I'm taking my NARS contour
blush and this is a dose of colors
blending brush and I will go ahead and
just place on outer parts of the eye and
time satisfied with the intensity of it
for my lip column taking this NYX liquid
suede and this is downtown beauty and
I'm taking over cosmetics liquid
lipstick and this is Dubai
so that is it for this tutorial and
here's the final look I love how it
turned out I'm very happy with it I
didn't really know exactly where I was
going with it why I knew I had a vision
and this is the vision very soft at the
same time a subtle edge some folk
freckles to really tie it all together
and I just like how it turned out so
hope you guys like it as well if you did
