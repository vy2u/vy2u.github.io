for days video what the heck was that
that kind of hurts when you do it
multiple times don't do that
welcome back to my channel so for
today's video I'm going to be showing
you guys how to achieve a spring skin I
want this video to be very skin focused
because I was thinking and I have so
many ideas for spring makeup that I want
to break it down into categories so this
is the spring skin I'm gonna go ahead
and show you guys my tips and tricks on
how to achieve this spring skin and yeah
that's what this video is going to be
for today yeah that's all I have to say
Wow shocker cuz I usually talk a lot
don't forget to subscribe but so I do
not ramble let's just go ahead and jump
right into the video
yeah really short intro okay so first
things first I'm gonna go ahead and do a
face mask this is the origins clear
improvement and the funny thing about
this mask well it's not about the mask
but I guess I can go ahead and give
credit to this mask for allowing me to
fulfill my life's purpose of becoming a
meme I use this before they change the
packaging I know it was older packaging
I know this for a fact unless my memory
is completely fool me right now but when
I used to use it it was a different
packaging but I'll go ahead and use this
to mask up and I'm thinking about doing
something where I challenge myself to
use like a mask for like 30 days like
the same masks just to see like the
improvements and everything you guys
probably loose about unity improvements
I think that masking is honestly to an
extent very therapeutic in a way because
you just get to relax and just enjoy the
fact that something's on your face just
making your skin better and I mean I
don't know I think it'd be kind of cool
okay so now our mask is on I'm gonna go
ahead and just let this deep clean my
pores and honestly speaking like
everyone's always saying a list of what
pores they don't exist we don't know
them in wild it's super flattering I do
have them especially on my nose so
honestly I've am asking a lot lately not
in heels and a wide sell bag but I have
been masking and I'm gonna go ahead and
just let
sit to just chill here while it dries
down and I'm gonna go ahead and wash it
off and be right back with you guys okay
so for my first step I'm gonna go ahead
and just prime the areas that need to be
primed and this is the NARS Port and
shine control primer and honestly
speaking this is like one of the only
shine control primers that I've tried
that actually works because I've tried
quite a few and this one it really works
I dig it
next for foundation you want to go ahead
and take something that's gonna last you
long I like to stick with foundations
that I know are bomb and then I happen
to review a lot here on my channel so I
have a lot of them that I love but this
one is drugstore and I love it I have
mentioned it before it's the maybelline
superstay foundation and I'm in the
shade 330 I'm gonna go ahead and mix in
some of my ELF daily hydration
moisturizer
I've already pumps them on the back of
my hand so you guys can see the ratio
and I'm gonna go ahead and take this
sponge just as Sonia cushy cushy Kashuk
I don't know how to pronounce it it's
from Target you guys know I'm talking
about and this sponge is fire and it
covers a lot see see how it's already
halfway done god I love it so see how
adding that moisturizer it just it made
this foundation look like second skin
because this foundation alone it
definitely looks like foundation it's so
hard to describe it's not a bad thing
because obviously you want your
foundation to look like foundation if
you know what I mean like I mean that's
what it's for but to me I feel like
adding a little bit of lotion it's
making it look so much more skin like
and that's what I want so I'm still
giving getting my uh coverage factor for
just more skin see how I hope you guys
can see on camera but it looks like just
second skin I still have that amazing
coverage from the superstay there's just
more toned down and it feels really good
that's the most important part it just
feels very lightweight it doesn't have
nothing on but you can tell that it
definitely added a nice even coverage on
my skin next for concealer I'm gonna
take my color pop nofilter concealer in
the shade 10:50 and I'm just apply it
just a little bit you guys know I
usually go OD oh my concealer this is
like a little for me like this is this
is almost like you know it's a lot to
handle
but that's I'm used to taking it up but
I really just want enough just to make
my undereye nice and even time ago I'd
taken another sponge from the same line
at Target and just blend this in
and I'm gonna go ahead and take a thin
layer of my makeup revolution banana
powder just to lightly set this in place
and so that you don't get a powder look
okay I just dipped into my powder and as
you can see it's a lot just tap the
excess powder see how much it is on the
back of your hand and then go under your
eye
you
and then taking the same sponge I'm
gonna go ahead and Ruth
my mouth area as well
and then I'm gonna go ahead and just
buff this out with a morphe 58 I'm not
going to take my micro smooth I'm simply
just kind of buffing into the skin just
to make sure that powder is nice in this
I don't know how to describe it but I
just want to Pat it down next time I go
ahead and just bronze my skin I'm taking
my favorite bronzer it's kind of bougie
but this is no bronzer oh and this is
also a bougie Tom Ford brush but to keep
it so real these things like a mug
like I don't think I've ever dealt with
brushes that shed so much before in my
life and I deal with a lot of brushes so
shit's like crazy
don't forget to use coke glue maman
morphe brushes calm for a 10% off
because like honestly it bounced the
joke if you didn't get it so don't be
like oh my god such a good boy
so serious yeah this brush was expensive
and I have other ones that I also bought
from them and all of them shed like
crazy and I've really never had a morphe
brush do that to me
and the morphe brushes are more
affordable so yeah just note it just
note it not always not the expensive
stuff I can't talk basically I'm saying
is Muji stuff isn't always worth it next
for blush I'm gonna go ahead and take my
milk makeup lip and cheek rally and I'm
sure you guys have seen me do this
before and let me see yeah they haven't
seen my fingers for this actually no I'm
taking a sponge we just do my sponge
I'm take the butt of this sponge and
just dip it into here and just go
directly on the cheek and with this you
want to be gradual you don't want to
just rub it just tap it like so if you
rub it you're gonna get a lot of product
on the cheek and it's not gonna look
good like this okay so just gradually
build it and don't do this just pounce
it on and imma go ahead and put a little
bit on my nose because I like how it
looks you don't have to do this though
it just looks really nice it look kind
of like rosy man let me go ahead and
just wipe off the back of this sponge
the blush will come off fairly easy if
you do this and you just kind of bounce
it onto a napkin and
I'm gonna go ahead and take the C yacht
LEM didn't do he sticks we're gonna dip
this into there and go ahead and apply
it to where we're gonna highlight
you
and then to go ahead and highlight I'm
gonna go ahead and take these two shades
vacation in Maheu
from the britman and morphe highlighting
palette and i'm taking this morphe m14 9
and we're gonna do our nose first
and I'm gonna go ahead and take the fan
brush and take a vacation this is
basically the same shades and I'm gonna
go ahead and just lightly just tap it on
and then for a more blush because I
definitely like more blush look
especially for spring I'm gonna take the
new NARS wanted palette this is watch it
too I'm taking this orange shade right
here and this is a makeup check t7 brush
just that off and we're just gonna do
this like so
and then just had everything in place
I'm gonna go ahead and take two settings
phrase first I'm gonna go ahead and take
the skin and navy eye makeup finishing
spray and this is the Bridal one because
it's super duper duper duper long
wearing you shake it up spray some out
and I'm gonna go ahead and take a little
bit of the more piece a miss because I
feel like out of all of these setting
sprays that I've used this one just it
just sets my makeup into my skin just
better I don't know how to describe it I
think it's because the mist is so
lightweight it just sells everything in
and a really nice Pleasant in a
satisfying way so here you have the
finished look and I just love it looks
like these because they're so radiant
and so simple and I feel like they
really do bring out like just the beauty
of anyone because it's like you look so
radiant and the eyes are really nice and
natural the brows are natural and then
you have a nice local loss to really
enhance your lips a little bit
everything just looks really nice and
soft and when I think of spring this is
the kind of skin that I think about and
this is like an ideal look for me so
that's it for this spring of skin
focused look hope you guys liked how it
turned out and if you guys happen to try
out any of the little techniques let me
know how it works out for you and of
course stay tuned for some really nice
fun and colorful spring eye makeup looks
but I just really wanted the skin to be
the star of a show for this video but
that is it for this video like I just
said and yeah let me know your favorite
thing about spraying down below let's
just leave comments down below and I'll
see you guys in my next video peace out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
