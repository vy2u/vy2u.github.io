today's video is gonna be a nice
summertime glowing makeup look I was
really inspired by Alyssa forever here
on YouTube and I was really inspired by
her look because she did this really
beautiful golden look and you know she
was just coming out the shade with her
glow and just yeah she's doing the most
it was amazing so I'm really inspired by
her glowing look I did this I love those
that yesterday and you guys me like on
snapchat so I'm psyched you know just
for you do it's nice and soft and yellow
and I did a wing today and never do
wings so hope you guys just like overall
look and honestly it's like the videos
gonna automatically be appealing cuz
look at this yellow backdrop
look at it you host such an inviting
color anyways let me shut the heck up I
hope you guys enjoyed the video if you
do enjoy the video please do subscribe
other than that thank you so much for
watching thank you so much for being
here and supporting me and I'll see you
guys soon
hey it's me okay so the first thing that
we're gonna do is surprise some a Prai
apply some primer this is the Laura
Mercier radiant bronze primer as you can
see just add such nice glow to the skin
and now I'm just applying some becca
topaz around the perimeter of my face
just to add a little bit of a bronze you
know one look all nice and golden now
I'm just applying my foundation this is
the cover FX natural finish foundation
and this is my favorite whenever people
see in person there's like what are you
wearing I'm like cover FX because balm
for concealer I decided to go with the
bare minerals bare skin concealer and I
like this concealer because it gives a
nice coverage but it's not too thick or
cakey or SuperDuper extreme glam ish is
very soft and I'm going for a softer
look so we gotta use a softer concealer
and to contour I'm going to take this
NYX contour highlight duo it's very new
to me I don't know the correct name but
this
I love this contour shades you guys
gonna see me use all the time now don't
get bored I just love it and now I'm
gonna work on setting everything I'm a
usually Laura Mercier powder and
honestly you guys gonna probably be like
ELISA why'd you do that all that doing
this and primer and all that just to set
it and the reason being is that
throughout the day all of what I did
with the primer the backup it shined
through so yeah it may seem that I'm
just completely taking it away but trust
me I am NOT it really does make a huge
difference and I looked on goals and
stuff everyone's complement to me I was
like yes and now I'm just bronzing up
with the black radiance pressed powder I
believe this one is chocolate or
something it'll be listed down below
like always now I'm just quickly
contouring my nose and I'm definitely
going to make sure to list this brush
down below because I feel like this was
the perfect nose contour brush I was
really liking you guys from morphe now
I'm moving into the eyes I took my mac
studio finish concealer like always and
use that to prime and then set that in
place with some translucent powder this
is just the most effective way of
priming my eye for me and for the entire
eye look aside from one eyeshadow I'll
be using the juvies place a nubian 2
palette so I took this nice kind of
brown shade first and then I took a
yellow shadow from another palette and I
mix the two together this look is
extremely simple into three eyeshadows
okay maybe four but it's still pretty
simple I took some more concealer just
to kind of blank out my lid and then
some mixing medium liner and then that
really really pretty yellow shade that
you see on the bottom left and then on
top of that I decided to go ahead with
this NYX glitter that I used in my queen
bee look just to kind of add more
sparkle now to just achieve a quick wing
I do plan on doing an updated winged
liner tutorial I feel like my first one
the wing was you know
kind of boring and I want to do one
that's more dramatic 400 eyes so I will
be doing that nice to pop on some lashes
and then I'm just going to really
highlight the crap of my little flappy
fold you guys always tell me the name of
that area but I just like to call flappy
phone I think it's cute and I'm using a
mixture of a white kind of eyeshadow in
the palette as well as the yellow that's
on my lid and it just creates the
perfect golden little highlight and then
I decided to add some white liner to my
waterline I never do this but I felt
like it was suitable for this look and
then I went ahead and added these same
shells that I added to my crease which
were the yellow and the nice brown shade
right to my lash line after that I'm
just going to add some bottom lash
mascara not too much but just enough to
complete the look and then the eyes
would be done for my highlight I decided
to use old time fee which is the benefit
Watts
up cream highlighter and I just apply
this to the areas that I typically
highlight and you can skip this step
it's totally okay because this will
definitely enhance the crap out your
highlighting some people they can't
handle that so if you want you can just
skip directly to your powder highlight
but i want to glow a lot today so i
applied that pretty much everywhere i
did the most got milk but yet i did the
most and i also applied it to my
forehead just to give a nice sheen when
I look to the side and people are like
whoa who is that
 now I'm just going to apply Laura
Geller gilded honey and I like this
highlight because it's nice and gold and
I feel like it was perfect for this look
and then I went in with this dose of
colors highlight and this just added
more Gold's and Miss to the skin like a
more baked to look for blush I'm going
to use this NARS blush and I'm so sorry
I didn't realize this a vib bruise
exclusive I love this blush I hope they
make it permanent and then lastly for my
lips I decided to go with my roasted
coffee lip pencil that get abused by
store for $2.99
and then my Anastacio undressed gloss
and then this will be the
finished look I hope you guys enjoyed it
and I'll see you guys soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
