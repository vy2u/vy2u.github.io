today's video is going to be a little
review slash demo of the new Sephora Pro
palette and I'm sure you guys have seen
them already and here is the two that I
have or here are the two let me go ahead
and speak grammatical English here the
good that I have I got the for this the
pro pigment I'll order both Pro pigment
palettes but this one is warm and this
one's editorial so go ahead and show you
guys this house first I am going to zoom
in on the eye so I do the eye so I'm
going to go ahead and kind of break down
the palette details before we go ahead
and do that so here's a warm palette
very pretty I did use this one because I
actually filmed a tutorial yesterday so
I decide to go ahead and read them for
you guys so I can already have my stop
on this one that's what this one looks
like BAM I'm trying to get my viewfinder
and make sure you guys can see it
because it wasn't going to focus at
first the palace both retail for $68
each it's a lot of money I know
even I bought them I was like okay these
better wow me because I need to see a
tall for a pallet I mean that's a lot of
money like you're getting them on I show
so ready go ahead and see one great with
these today I made you a brown smokey
eye with a warm palette because you guys
really want to see a brown smokey eye so
I got to make sure cleaned y'all and
then I don't know what I'm going to do
with other palette but we're going to
create some well today so if you guys
want to see me just talk about the
palette as I doing my due and view them
and just keep on watching alrighty so
off-camera I went ahead and prime my
eyes and the Smashbox photo-finish 24
hour or we're going to call it week
where our photo finish primer and I'm
going to go ahead and just jump straight
into my first look I'm gonna go ahead
and knock out this brown smokey eye
because it's super easy and already I'm
doing so go ahead and do that one first
go ahead take the yellow shade in the
palette first and just place that on my
eye
and I'm going to take this orange shade
which is a couple rows down and we'll go
ahead and just place that right
underneath because I want to show you
guys what's doing right now I'm going to
show you guys this palette right now as
you can see there is a lot of kickback
so that's one thing that I most want to
power when I first use that is that it
does do that so just be warned so you
will have to kind of blow on it as you
go because otherwise it would just
become a disaster to be a mess other
than that they apply really nice as you
guys can see right now but yeah it has
loud back kick back so just prepare the
blue that sounds kind of nasty but
prepare to blow next time go ahead and
take the brownie red shape to the right
of that shadow I'm going to pop that
right on top of that let me go ahead
take some mac's fix+ and I just want to
spray my brush and I'm the pack the same
Brown onto the lid area I'd like to
spray it more even next to be able to
use the shimmer at the palate I'll go
ahead and just pop this light gold into
my brow bone then I go ahead and take
this kind of light creamsicle orange
just to kind of blend the two together
so it's no harshness going on up there
next taking my morphe in 4:08 I'm gonna
go ahead and take the same Brown that
I've been using on places the whole eye
I'm gonna spray with some six-plus and
I'm still pop it underneath here
then years just look at how it applies
without any six plus I did not read
can't see it re what so hard take ours
and then same time I did not go ahead
and win my brush again I'm just go ahead
and dip into it and show you guys how it
is without sex plus so that's the
pigmentation Oh absence invitation
without six plus on this I I just want
to do the six plus because it kind of
makes it easier to apply my opinion
under the eye but here's without eating
six plus just you guys can see the
pigmentation because I want people to
say oh it's going to take my dick is a
big plus note this is without big flow
still think we do go ahead and take the
orange and just pop underneath and it's
official I let them pop a little bit of
the gold shimmery shadow of rice in my
flat fold area so here we have this look
with the first pallet and my overall top
of this one is obviously I personally
love the colors in it I'm sure you guys
know me you guys know I love my brown I
love my yellow you know the little
mellow yellows the oranges but this
whole palette screams spa it screams me
however if you've already purchased the
morphe and Jaclyn hill palette I would
say go ahead and save your money and
don't get this because I don't know
where it went with my palette hold on
make sure you got k here is the Jaclyn
hill one I got banana power over it
anyways ignore my banana powder here is
the Jaclyn hill one and it has a mellow
yellow if anything this yellow is easy
to be more pigmented than the one in
this palette because it has a little
more yellow in it have the brown I can
essentially create the same exact look
with this palette so if you already
purchased palette I know it's coming
back on Tuesday it's going back I put
the date because they just announced it
but if you are purchases salad it is
more affordable and you do get this
little pop of color you I mean you know
like honestly like you don't need to buy
this before Pro one if you already have
this one and I'm saying if you don't
have this one because I'm sure a lot who
bought it because it was such a like
highly anticipated palette so if you
already finished
on this and wait to get it I wouldn't
recommend you into some more problem
because I mean you can do the same thing
with it because I literally just
recreate the brown fungi that I did but
this one was out last week so you don't
need a salad but if you are makeup
collector and you just love having a
bunch of different shadows even though
they can all be the same then hell yeah
go for it because I love it now we have
this look done let's go ahead and wash
this off and go ahead and do a look
using the editorial one all righty so
I'm gonna go ahead and take this more
feet in four for one and we're going to
go ahead and I like to use orange
because it's orange to want to use it I
think let's see it's a rice bag to tell
you that this palette has the same kind
of kicky becky where it kind of gets all
over the palette you need to blow so far
on the back but I mean so far feel good
go ahead and take this kind of magista
shake it looks really pretty oh yeah oh
yeah the kool-aid man kool-aid man says
that right yeah
the Masters / parents and - outta the
car go dragon pigmentation pigmentation
pig mint taste it this usually nice I
feel this okay let's see what I wanted
you to meet I'm going to go ahead and
take this shade it's right next to the
orange like a peachy shade
I don't know I'm doing with it though I
kind of like push it upwards over the
orange you know like I know I applied
the orange but like we're going to
cancel that I just put this I'll
gather why I think this neon color for
neon pink be bit go ahead spray my sick
 and I'm going to stick that to the
lid
it's like spraying fix+ made it darker
than what a seviche
that's okay I'll kind of I'll lay it
down first and then I'll go over it with
the dry layer do a bit of dry layer okay
this paint has a lot of Fallout lots of
farlows the pretty pink though begins to
fall out as you see is I'm packing it on
it's coming to its true form which will
be neon but holy fall I guess I can't
see as much as I'm doing it but it is
falling oh my god oh my crying pink
right now he wipe this off okay that's
good because some fallout I've noticed
kind of nears that one just kind of went
off so by under eyes okay and now we're
kind of takes a really bright blue
almost a really pretty blue or take that
blue we're gonna pop this as our
transition shade
and I'll go ahead and use this Mickey
green shade as well mixed that is
what do I do next I'll go ahead and take
this really vibrant blue very vibrant
pop it in closer support you guys do we
get that with these pallets like both of
them are amazing I mean granted I am
getting to fall out but I mean look live
look live all that look amazing
this pigmentation is Wow
I'm gonna go ahead and just kind of
blend that out a little bit with the
other shades I put on it'll look crazy
off kara went ahead and pop my lashes
and did some really big a swing I love
it where you gonna make it the wings is
big but I mean look good so that's okay
and I'll go ahead and finish off the eye
by doing the bottom task of the eyes
well if you would go ahead and take this
oh I don't even know what this is a
royal land nickel it's just an IV color
brush and put the pink underneath here
stop with the dark pink right here in
the neon pink in the inner corner okay
so here we have the second look with the
editorial palettes overall myself on
this palette is that I love the
pigmentation the pigmentation is
definitely there you guys can see that
design me applying these shadows they're
really nice shadows in terms of the
quality of them on blending the only
thing that I will say especially about
this palette is that I noticed a lot
more fall out with this palette versus
the warm palette and I will dig up until
my under eye over here is kind of more
cool tone because the blue kind of stain
under my eye so that's what I mention is
that the Blues yeah you want to make
sure you lay up some powder before you
wear the blues otherwise your eye will
look kind of cool tone and I don't like
that does not look good so other than
that I would definitely this palette is
really nice if you do not have anything
like it I definitely were recommended to
be purchase because those pinks
look at them they're giving me life is
looking at them like the Pink's the
oranges living I did not use a purple so
I'm sure we will find a way to use those
in a later tutorial
I do not going to use the shimmer but
let's go ahead and just kind of swap
over so let me just kind of grab some
those look nice so I'm sure those will
not disappoint
using with palettes I kind of aim for
the mask because I feel like it's hard
to pull off a nice matte eyeshadow
specifically a Mac and neon bright
eyeshadow then it is a shimmer shadow so
I kind of want to aim for those once
more because I think those are more
important to review because a shimmer
trail I mean most of our nice I mean
unless you just come have a really bad
lab most shimmer shadows don't
disappoint but the masks that could get
kind of tricky but these masks really
nice as you can see to space on my
eyeballs so yeah that is my final
thought on this palette and my final
thoughts on both palettes are they're
really nice and if it's for my review
I'm talking so much because why are you
