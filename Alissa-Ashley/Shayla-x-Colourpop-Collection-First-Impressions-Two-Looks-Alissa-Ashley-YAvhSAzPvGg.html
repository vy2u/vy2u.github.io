for today's video
as you can see in the title I am going
to be demoing and kind of first
impression and kind of reviewing the
color pop and makeup Shayla
collaboration I have yet to use anything
so I'm quite excited because it looks
really good so if you guys want to see
that and just keep on watching and hope
you guys enjoy it okay let's open it up
first off let's see it says Shayla X
color pop makeup is more than painting
our face it's an interpretation of our
souls and a perception of our creativity
XO Shayla I think that's really cute and
here is the artwork what do you call
that
like the promo work for it I thought it
was really cool little video with the
dripping stuff I probably freaked out
because I'm claustrophobic and if I feel
anything on my eyes I'm like ah so just
thought I'd share that but what's really
cool on her and here is the packaging of
the PR hints the purple backdrop I
thought I had a darker purple but I did
it so I was really sad about that
because you guys know what take my
creativity stuff seriously thought I had
one to match that's okay
here's what it looks like to loose
powder highlighters three luxe lipsticks
I believe this one is a gloss yes it is
an ultra glossy lip and then you get an
eye shadow palette and I'm pretty sure
it's 16 shades I think that's what I saw
on trend mood make sure 16 shades so you
get 16 shades in the palette and let's
go ahead and open it up here is the
packaging it's called perception
perception percept perception perception
mm-hmm I'm so hyper I'm so fight for I
would apologize but honestly no because
I'm a doped up on happiness and no one's
gonna take it away from me here's what
it looks like really nice and pretty and
when you open it up oh I'm gonna use
that warned you guys already know me you
guys already know me me go ahead and get
in focus here this is what a look like
and also in the palette you get a nice
sized mirror as well so we'll use the
mirror to do our makeup today I'm gonna
go ahead and do the eyes first because
just
actually in my routine I do eyes
highlight then live so we're gonna do
this step by step so I go ahead and put
this down and let's get into this
palette okay so obviously I can't use
every single shadow on my lid but I'll
go ahead and link shayla's video because
she's watched every single shade so you
guys able to see them but I'm gonna go
ahead and create a little look I'm gonna
go ahead and first prime my eyes with my
Maybelline instant age rewind concealer
puts out on her eyeballs and I'm
blending this out with the morphe Y 18
I'm just gonna get that nice and on
there I don't like to put too much
because I feel like if you put too much
concealer you can get a little Creasy so
don't put too much taking one of my
favorite brushes this itsmyrayeraye BH
Cosmetics I'm gonna go ahead and take
the shake culture which seems to be a
really nice transition shade and we're
gonna pop this in my crease okay nice I
was right I really enjoy palettes that
have a nice transition shade or just a
shade that can be the base of every
other shade I can't stand in with
palettes have like a bunch of really
intense colors and there's no like
transition because it's like while the
colors may be pretty how am I gonna
transition it how am I gonna you know
like soften if I need to so this color
you could tell it's really good for like
say you apply too much of one of the
more intense shades you can use this to
soften it out so I love when palettes
have those kind of colors in them next
time go ahead and take the shade thick
Oh Ashley Nam say I'm torn between the
thick and revenge by thing I'm gonna
take thick because I love orange and I'm
gonna go ahead and just pop this on the
outer part of my eye
switching over to a morphe y22 I'm going
to take those exact two shades and pop
muttering my
and I'm gonna go ahead and pop spill the
tea which is a shimmer on my lid and
this is with no primer or know like
stickiness to adhere to I definitely
like the pigmentation of that I'm gonna
go ahead and take revenge and I'm gonna
pop that on the outer part of my eye
and I'm gonna go ahead and pop on a
little bit of mascara and I'm gonna take
and bothered and pop it in this little
inner corner and in the lip color for
this we're gonna go ahead and pop out
one of these luxe lipsticks and this is
go ahead and place this on the lips mmm
I'm not gonna fill my entire lips
because as you can see I kind of have
like a natural lip line I feel like it
may look a little bit crazy without a
brown lip liner um but I don't want to
put one because I want you guys to see
the true color I like this color a lot I
love peach enews they're really really
pretty and I love I look on my skin tone
so I am happy with this and then I'm
gonna go ahead and pawn this lip gloss
on top to finish off look number one
like that I like it I like it okay so
here you have look number one I decide
to do two looks because I just want to
give you guys a more simplified option
with the palette and they were going to
go ahead and up it up and do something
more glam I just want to give you guys
two options because I just think that's
kind of cool so now that we've used a
little bit of the palette to create one
look as well as a lipstick and a gloss
let's go ahead and create a second look
and we're just gonna build on top of
this so I can use more of these shadows
in the palette and use other lipsticks
to give you guys my final thoughts on
this collection and then we also have to
dig into these freakin highlighters
because I want to see what those are
about as well okay so to build on top of
this to make it more glam I'm gonna take
played-out which seems to be a nice
little brown shade and we're gonna pop
this on the outer corner and probably
carry it a little bit inside I - wow
that's pigmented okay
we're gonna take a little bit of thick
just to kinda blend it out
oh it's looking good already I'm gonna
go ahead and actually I feel like hmm
I'm not gonna match the bottom for my
eye I'm not gonna put the dark on the
bottom I think I like the fact that it's
deeper on the top I'm gonna leave it
like that I'm not gonna put the brown on
the bottom
nope but I am gonna go ahead and use
another one of these shimmer eyes I
think we should have some fun and I'm
gonna take let's see this is ie it's
like kind of greeny golds you have sassy
which reminds me a lot of I think it's
blue brown pigment by Mac I think I like
that one I think I like sassy I'm gonna
go ahead and take sassy and we're gonna
put on the lid that takes a C on a
finger I'm going to spray that finger
and i'ma pop on the lid
be ok
and let's go ahead and use the other
lipsticks I'm gonna go ahead and take
come on sis it's a pink let's see how we
like it
that is really pretty however I feel
like it does not look good with this eye
look so we're gonna take it off cuz this
is not I don't think Elizabeth's I look
but it's really pretty really really
pretty what an offer does I look and
then let's take quicky quicky is
definitely another one that I would pair
with a brown lip liner to look better my
fear one of them all is the ooh I like
that one the most
so I'm gonna go ahead and put that on
because I felt the most like beautiful
with that went on this combo is
literally everything I like it a lot and
the more I look at the eye look I feel
like it looks incomplete because I had
to put the dark on the bottom so I guess
I'll just go ahead and do that
so I don't get mad when I'm editing this
and I don't like a look
okay so we're looking good now let's go
ahead and get into these highlighters
because I feel like I was the most
excited for the highlighters for sure I
feel like if you love glow usually
excited about all highlighters and this
is one of them okay so one of them is
called booming going to open it up
here's the packaging by the way go open
it here is what it looks like
really nice and pretty and the other one
is called pose ooh
may I just say that I'm so happy that
sticker came off with such ease I hate
it when I get products and it's like the
sticker is a pain in the butt to remove
because you're just like dude I want to
use the product but I can't get to the
products and how I'm going to use the
product why you do that did the product
okay so pose definitely seems to be more
on like the rose gold side whereas
blooming is definitely more gold so I'm
gonna go ahead and use boom in because I
mean naturally I just feel like gold and
highlighters look at the best on my skin
so I'm gonna go ahead and use boom in
someone go ahead and take my morphe e61
and go ahead and dip into the cap dust
some off and let's see how it applies
okay oh you guys saw that did you guys
see that let me do it first so and this
is like my review and this is like what
I look for with any highlight see how
you can see it and it's blinding but
they want to turn to the side you cannot
see it sitting on my face I always say
that whenever I highlight sits on my
face I hate it I think it looks really
ugly and it brings out texture this one
you cannot see it blinding you can't see
it it on the news
okay so here we have the finished look
and just to give you guys my little
final thoughts on the collection even
though I'm sure that it's obvious that I
end up really liking it I personally
love color pop products I do I apply
every single thing that comes out no
because there's a whole lot of stuff
that comes out we all know that color
pop is always constantly releasing
things in terms of what I liked the most
if I were to have to recommend maybe one
or two of the products from the
collection I would definitely say that
the highlighter is really really really
pretty and I was pleasantly surprised
because sometimes loose powder
highlighters are almost too much for the
face in my opinion but this one is
really just nice and Cheney so I like
that about it and I also think that you
could probably definitely filled it to
be more intense if that's what you
prefer and I also like the lipstick
because I feel like it's a really nice
peachy nude and I like the gloss and I
like the palette I mean basically I like
everything
the other two lipstick colors they were
nice but will I wear them realistically
probably not so much because I
definitely lean more towards
turns towards a peachy nude color and I
think loss and like the palette because
I feel like what the palette as you can
see I did two looks with it so you're
able to do a nice everyday looking
you're also able to do a nice vampy look
so I do like having that option in a
palette but yeah that is like my little
final review in my first impression I do
light the collection and congratulations
to Shayla for having a color pop
collection because color prom is really
cool brand but yeah that's about it for
my rambling I very much hope you guys
enjoyed this little video if you guys
want to see any other product reviews or
just any other videos from me let me
know but other than that thank you guys
so much for watching and I'll see you
guys in my next video peace up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
