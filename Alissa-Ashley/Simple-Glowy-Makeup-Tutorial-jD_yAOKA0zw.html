for today's video I partnered with
Sephora to bring you this simple glowy
makeup look highlighting is currently
trending s áfourá
and you guys know them all about the
glow so for today's video I'll be
showing you how to achieve this simple
look the first thing I'm going to do is
moisturize my skin and this is belief
aqua balm and it's super hydrating and
this can be found at Sephora every
products I'm using today can be found at
Sephora and then I'm going to take this
beautiful Marc Jacobs product this is
there liquid dew drops and I'm going to
mix it with my foundation and this is
going to make my foundation with more
radiant and dewy it also kind of sheers
it down a bit and makes it look more
skin like which I like because whenever
I do a glowy look I try to focus a
little more on the skin and make sure
the skin looks amazing and I'm going to
blend that name with the Beauty Blender
next for concealer I'm taking this
concealer by stellar and I like this one
because one it's hydrating - it's not
too matte and I do not want a mattifying
look and three the color of it isn't too
overwhelming because I don't want to go
for that crazy under-eye highlight look
today I kind of wanted to be more
simplified so that the focus is more on
the glow you never want to have too much
going on to your face when you're doing
a glowy look you want to focus on that
glow because that is we're aiming for
and then I'm going to go ahead and set
my highlighted areas with this Laura
Mercier translucent powder
there's no baking going on today I'm
just packing that products in with the
Beauty Blender just to ensure that it
stays nice enough you know nice and
since and then we're gonna take this
Sephora number 98 brush and we're going
to lightly dust away that excess powder
leaving us with a nice flawless finish
and then we're going to take my beloved
Sephora microphone powder and we're
going to lightly set the rest of our
face in place nothing too crazy but just
setting it really lightly now for brows
I'm taking benefit browsing and we're
going for a pretty simple brow today
nothing too extreme I'm just going to
fill it in and follow my natural brow
shape just to give me a nice soft brow
after we're done filming in our brows
I'm just taking that stellar concealer
to do some light cleanup work and we're
going to use this to prime our eye we're
going for a really simple eyelid today
by simple I mean super simple we're
going to take this Sephora collection
Pro dimensional highlighting palette
it's beautiful and we're going to take
the clear gloss and we're just going to
apply a little bit gloss on our lips
just to give us some shine nothing too
crazy or editorial just very very simple
and we're also going to use this as our
base for our highlight for our face and
adding a cream base before you add your
powder highlight and really intensify
your highlight and I'm only applying a
little bit because I don't want to go
for something too intense I'm kind of
finding a little middle ground a little
bit intense but still nice and pretty
and soft so I'm just really packing that
in with the finger and you want to use a
finger because your finger is warm so
you're going to get a much better
results by just taking your time and
patting in with your finger and if you
guys still need a little bit of help
even after watching my tutorial you can
download the Sephora app and they have a
virtual artist feature where it will
virtually take you step-by-step through
the highlighting process as well as a
bunch of other tutorials if you need
some extra assistance and now we're
going to take the very pretty Kevin a
Quan and Neil highlighter palette and
this palette is gorgeous because it is a
blend of three of his best-selling
highlighters and they're all different
tones so in certain lighting situations
as you can see right here it looks a
little bit more golden but when I went
to another different lighting situation
it looked more pinky and rose gold it
was really cool and I was like whoa this
is really cool so this highlight is yes
for me and now we're going to go ahead
and bronze up our skin really quickly
using our Too Faced dark chocolate
Soleil bronzer I'm sure I'm like a
broken record with this product but I
want to make sure my skin is really nice
and warmed up and then we're going to
take this beautiful benefit gala for Nia
blush and this blush is so rosy and so
pretty and I feel like it will look
perfect with
just look and then we're going to finish
up our look using some mascara and just
a little bit of mascara nothing too
crazy just enough to enhance our lashes
because again I want the focus to be on
the skin when I'm glowing
I like the focus to be on the glow I do
not want a lot going on and then we're
going to add this light pink gloss from
the Sephora collection and I want to do
a gloss because I want to keep it very
simple very everyday wearable nothing
too extreme and then lastly I'm going to
set my face in place with this khloga
tour miss that can get us before as well
and then we have the finished look if
you guys happen to recreate it or if you
happen to just want to do what's
trending at Sephora be sure to hashtag
highlighting and hashtag trending exif
aura so that can see you guys look other
than that thank you guys so much for
watching and i'll see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
