hair toot I'm actually quite flattered
that you guys want to learn because I
don't really have a lot of hair so I'm
just like okay so the first thing I did
was I just kind of dampened my hair and
then I'm going to take my shea moisture
coconut and hibiscus curl enhancing
smoothie and I'm going to massage that
into my head and the reason I do that is
because I use a lot of gel and if you
only use Jo your heads gonna feel like a
rock and this just kind of makes it nice
and soft but still firm I think my brush
and just kind of start brushing it and
then I'm going to take my eco styler
olive oil gel and I'm going to start
brushing the top of my hair back I just
draw at the top and kind of just work my
way around it I said way way around it
and I'm going to take this brush just to
kind of brush everything back so that
there's no little lumps because you
can't get that if you rush through this
and then I go on the side behind my ear
in the back of my head and then I'm
going to do the same to the other side
this is honestly so easy honestly I feel
like it's super achievable it just all
depends on how much you wet your hair
and how much product to use I feel like
my tip to give to you is not to over wet
your hair because that's the reason why
the curls start to pop up I used to have
this problem a lot now I figure why is
this not working for me
but because my hair was too wet so you
just wanted to be a little bit damped so
it's easy to work with and then you
apply your products you feel me and I'm
going to brush it again just to make
sure everything's lying flat and I'm
gonna go back and with a brush and
continue to work on my little slicked
back hair style and I use my nail oh my
god it's a ratchet to create a part
that's kind of too lazy to get a comb
and it works off mix have claws or nails
and then I'm going to work on my edges
um I don't really focus too much on baby
hairs come on child
I'm kidding um yeah there's never been
that series to me I just like to make it
nice and sleek and then I'm going to
just keep brushing it and time satisfied
with how it's laying and then I'm going
to make a little duck tail in the back
just to kind of make sure it's nice and
together I'm going to smooth it down it
is going to look a little bit white at
first but that's just the curl enhancing
smoothie but after it dries that goes
away and there we have it see it was
SuperDuper easy um you could do this at
home
DIY um so yeah so here are just pictures
of me with this hairstyle um I've had it
with so many different colors as you can
see um blonde or whatever kind of color
you might call this someone's add a
little bit of a curl to the front if you
guys want to see how to do that I will
make a video on how I create my little
waves and that is it
thank you guys so much for watching and
please let me know what you guys would
like to see next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
