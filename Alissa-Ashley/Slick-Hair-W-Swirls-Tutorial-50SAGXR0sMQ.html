today's video is pretty highly requested
and is how I achieved this hairstyle so
let's jump right into it the first thing
I'm going to do is take my Shea Moisture
curl enhancing smoothie and you can take
any kind of leave in conditioner product
that's relatively thick and very
conditioning because this just helps
with slicking down the hair and it
doesn't make your hair hard as a rock
and I don't really like rock hard hair
only like some things are okay I'm
getting my god and I'm just going to
spritz my hair you use water but I like
to use this because it smells good and
I'm going to make sure my hair is nice
and damp and I'm going to take a comb
and just part it out and really get my
part nice and sleek and I'm just going
to take my eco style or olive oil gel
eco style is my favorite gel it doesn't
matter if it's clear pink olive I like
all of them and I'm just going to work
on slipping back my hair as you can see
I'm taking a wide tooth brush and I'm
just brushing my hair down and that's
what helps with the sleekness because if
I just go with the red brush I'm still
going to have some frizzy and some curly
hair underneath that slicked back layer
and it's just not going to lay back flat
and right now I'm just fixing my part
because it got a little messed up and
I'm just going to work on really just
slicking back my hair I do have a
slicked back hair tutorial without the
swoop so if you want to see that I'll
link that below and yeah I'm the reason
it's so white is because the curl
enhancing smoothie it's a very white
product like it takes forever to dry
sometimes anywho now I'm just going to
take that first top section of my hair
and just part it out because that's the
part where I'll be focusing on the swoop
and I'm just going to lay the rest of my
hair down flat and now for the top part
I'm going to switch on and off with the
red brush and my comb and I'm using the
comb because I want that part to be
really flat as you can see a lot of
product is coming out at first but then
it becomes easier to comb through which
is where the leave-in conditioner comes
into play because it just makes a little
bit easier
my hair so yeah I'm just going to comb
it out until it is completely flat like
I want it to be flat like a like a flat
booty and then I'm just going to brush
it out and I'm not going to create the
swoops just yet I actually want to make
sure everything's flat first and then
you see my little swooping technique in
just a second
now the first thing I'm gonna do to make
it easier for myself is just get it all
nice and neat as you see me doing here
I'm just going to make sure everything
is nice and flat on my forehead and this
is gonna act as my guide and now I'm
going to take my comb and start making
my little swirls and as you can see I'm
just pushing it up and using the comb to
make the swirls and that's why I like I
always like giggle to myself and you
guys asked how do you do this I'm just
like dude it's so easy like literally
I'm yeah I'm not a master at it but yeah
as you can see it's really easy I'm just
alternating from one end of the poem to
the other um you can make your swoops
more defined you can make them more laid
back they all come out differently when
I do it it just all depends on you know
how focused I am but that is all you
have to do and then you have your swoops
and you don't necessary have to use the
same products you've used whatever
products work for your hair this will
works my hair and now I'm just taking a
toothbrush and going in and detailing
you know you can't just have you know
just a flat style I want to have some
not baby hairs but you know I want to
add some texture over there you know
kind of want to have just swoops and
then the rest of the hair just kind of
boring see I'm just working on it and
then usually when I you know place my
hand over the hair it gets rid of all
that white stuff so don't freak out
about that and I'm just gonna perfect
the style and then it'll be done
and now we are finished and of course
it's not like perfect right now because
our gel still has to dry but after is
dried it is perfection so I hope you
guys like this thank you so much for
watching and I'll see you guys soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
