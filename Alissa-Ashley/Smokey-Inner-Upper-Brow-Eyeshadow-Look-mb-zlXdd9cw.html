today's look is nothing super special I
just switched up the way I did my eye
shadow for this look and I really liked
it and I filmed myself getting ready
because I knew that if I post the look
if you guys really liked you guys are
gonna want a video and you guys did end
up liking it you guys asked me if I
filmed it and it so here we have it hope
you guys like this look I actually
really enjoyed you know the switch up so
yeah don't forget to subscribe and let's
jump right into it so the first thing
I'm going to do is apply my makeup
forever Ultra HD foundation and if you
notice my video is a little bit slow
paced in this part because I've noticed
that I really speed up this part a lot
and yeah I just want to switch it up
just to see if you guys like it so if
you guys do like it when I make it a
little bit more slow even if it's the
same thing let me know because I will
continue to do this next I'm going to
take this cat cream makeup and this is
just going to be to correct my under-eye
I don't have extreme dark circles but I
do have some darkness and pigmentation
in that area so I just want to clean it
up a little bit before applying my
concealer and then next I'm going to
take my honest hacia concealer this is
in the shade 3.5 and it is quite a few
shades lighter than my actual skin tone
but this is my favorite concealer like
these last three months or so and I'm
going to place that underneath my eye
like I said and on my forehead just to
highlight those areas and then for my
contour I'm going to use the Make Up For
Ever Ultra HD foundation stick in the
shade are five-30
avoiding placing on my jaw line because
I'm finding that I don't mean like
placing on my jaw line anymore I like to
use a powder bronzer instead of a cream
on that area because yeah I'm not as
defined anymore so it just looks a
little strange and I blended out my
highlight using my ISA Beauty sponge
it's definitely been my favorite and
I've completely abandoned my Beauty
Blender and I'm going to blend on my
contour with the foundation brush that I
used earlier
and then I want to add some definition
to my nose using the same makeup forever
foundation stick and my artis brush it
will be listed below because I cannot
remember the name of it but yeah I'm
just going back on my sponge just to
make sure it's nice and blended
and I'm going to start setting my
highlight using Sacha cosmetics butter
cup setting powder and for under the eye
I am going to let it bake why do my eye
shadow but I'm just going to place on
all the other areas where I want this
powder you can set your entire face with
this powder but I just like for my
highlight and to set my face I'm going
to use the cover FX illuminating setting
powder in the shade medium and I'm just
going to place that on the areas where
I'm going to apply my bronzer and the
bronzer I'm using is the Too Faced
cosmetics dark chocolate Soleil bronzer
and the reason I like to set that area
first is because I feel like when I
apply the bronzer on liquid it just
feels sticky and it gets a little
blotchy so I avoid that by setting it
first and I'm just going to take some
bronzer on my nose as well for the eyes
I'm going to start up by taking my
Anasazi a brow powder duo and I used to
take my dip brow but the reason I'm
taking a powder it's because when I
apply my eyeshadow and I blend it into
my eyebrow it's just going to blend more
seamlessly and it's gonna look more
natural and I feel like the Dipper I
would have looked a little too intense
and it wouldn't have worked for this
look and I'm going to clean up my brows
with my mac studio finish concealer and
then prime my eyes use nikkei cosmetics
cream makeup that I used earlier now
since I use a lot of different
eyeshadows and a lot of different eye
shadow brands I'm going to save myself
the embarrassment of getting very very
tongue-twisted and I'm not going to say
the archives as I go instead I'm just
going to explain what I'm doing and all
the eye shadows will be listed in order
of use below in the
scription bar so first I took an orange
I shout out just as the face and I
created the shape that I'm going for
with that eyeshadow first and I'm taking
a brown eyeshadow and going over that
shape specifically focusing on the inner
part of the eye because that's the part
where I want to be the most smokey and
bold and I am switching off brushes I
like to take certain brushes to pack on
the product and then other brushes to
kind of blend it out which is what I'm
doing and I am just taking a mixture up
orange eye shadows I took lighter orange
eyeshadow I took orange eyeshadow I knew
weren't gonna be as pigmented I took
Brown eyeshadows knew that we're gonna
be as pigmented and I am just building
that up in time satisfied with the
gradient that I was trying to create and
right now I'm just packing on I chose on
my lid it took me about three tries to
get a nice color that I was satisfied
with I didn't want to be too bright I
didn't want to be too muted so I ended
up you know messing around with a few of
my pigments until I got the correct
shade and then I'm just going to dust
off that excess powder because it has
served its purpose and I'm going to go
back in and really try to add more depth
and definition to that inner part of the
eye because I really want it to be very
dark and of course this I shall look is
for everyone but I really want to switch
it up because I noticed that I pretty
much do the same I shall look all the
time and then I took these very very
natural lashes because I wanted the eye
shadow to be the focus and then I took
this pencil from la girl and is a brown
pencil and I'm going to smoke that out
using the same Browns I use on top and
these same orange I used on top as well
and I'm just going to dust away the
excess powder on the rest of my face
and next I'm going to go ahead and
contour my nose just really connecting
my nose contour with that eye shadow and
making sure it's all nice and blended
because I felt like a nice nose contour
would go great with this eye shadow
placement and then I took some brown
eyeshadow and created a small wing on
the outer part of the eye because I feel
like it would go well with this eye
shadow placement a lot of what I did it
kind of just willed the flow and how I
felt would look good with how I did the
eye shadow so yeah just follow me here
and even with my nose highlight I did
not bring it all the way up because I
felt like it would have went bad with
the eye shadow placement and for my
highlight I took the anastacio so
Hollywood illuminator and I highlighted
all of my areas I don't mean highlighted
and I really made sure to highlight my
brow bone today which is something I do
occasionally but I want to do it because
I thought it went right with this eye
shadow look and then for the lips I want
to use one of the new Anasazi lip
glosses and this is in the shade sepia
and then for the final steps of this
look I'm going to take on stassi's brow
is just add a little bit of definition
into the brows and then I'm going to
spray my face with some fix+
and as you can see I was really trying
to keep my eyes open because I was
dreading the idea of mascara getting
onto my under eye which has been
happening a lot to me recently and it's
been happening so much and that's why I
decided to do my bottom lashes last and
then after that we will have the
finished look I really hope you guys
enjoyed this I really enjoyed it I like
switching up every once in a while and
doing things that I am not used to doing
but yeah if you do recreate this look
make sure to hashtag Alyssa Ashley on
Instagram and also be short on what else
you guys like to see and thank you so
much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
