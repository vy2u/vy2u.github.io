so for today's video I'm gonna go ahead
and show you guys how to get this little
look right here and it's not even so
much about the look the focus is this
beautiful palette I might use the
palette for the look but I only created
because I wanted to use this palette so
bad and if it looks familiar it is
because this palette is inspired by the
burn book in the movie Mean Girls and
this palette is from storybook cosmetics
and if you have not seen me girls before
what are you doing I'm sure you see it
you guys will understand why this
palette is just like God everyone's so
excited because we're like oh my
goodness we're all Mean Girls fans we
love Mean Girls so to have a palette
that looks like the actual burn book
it's just so cool and when you open it
you get all this beautiful goodness so
it's just double cool and the names it's
like it's butter carb gruel Glen Coco
Wednesday so fetch it's just like it's
so nostalgic so I'm sure everyone was
excited about it so I want to go ahead
and do a video for you guys but yeah
that's what we're doing today I'm gonna
go ahead and show you guys how I got
this look using the palette and just my
overall review on the palette itself and
if it's worth your money isn't a concept
or is it cancelled we're gonna find out
so if you guys want to see then just
keep on watching and I hope you guys
enjoy it okay so starting out with a
clean eye as you guys can see already
did this i off-camera and here's a look
of the look that I filmed yesterday with
the same palette and I'm just kind of
like went crazy with color because I
wanted to try out a bunch of different
shades so I'll go ahead and give you
guys a little review at the end of the
video because as you guys can see I used
like practically every single color in
the palette but lose my voice I toned it
down a bit because our nails said it was
a lot sue I'm gonna go ahead and take
this NYX jumbo eye pencil in the shade
milk and I'm going to apply that to my
eye as my face just a little bit Yarnell
was like not good
I knew much that's okay
so I did this sign I sent to her I was
like this is okay and she was like oh
you care about my opinion I'm just like
shut up
I know hmm next I'm gonna take this dose
of colors blending brush and I'm taking
the shade you can't sit with us and I'm
just gonna apply it to my crease next
I'm taking a shade so fetch and I will
describe so fetch as a really pretty
matte orange it's not going to give you
how do I describe it okay so on a scale
of 1 to 100 in terms of vibrancy I would
say so that just like I've ever mm make
a 70 so it's not gonna give you like BAM
orange in your face like NARS purchase
single eyeshadow would it's like a soft
orange as you guys can see it's not like
a BAM
hey I'm orange nice to meet you it's
Rafa so that's that's describing things
that I'll describe it hey na hey y'all
I'm orange was good okay I'm gonna stop
talking now next I'm gonna take
Wednesday and Wednesday is a hey I'm
Wednesday what's good Wednesday is a
super vibrant pink it is super duper
duper in your face and I like this color
a lot because it's so fun and I'm gonna
pack Wednesday on the outer part of the
eyes see how much more vibrancy is in
Wednesday versus the other colors so I
like that because when you first look at
the palette you might assume that's so
fetch is gonna be super intense so I
don't know I feel like palettes or what
makes a good palette is when there's a
mixture of intense mattes and not so
intense kind of pulled back because you
can play around a bit and you can also
create everyday looks with the palette
with the less intense Maps so I think
upon looking at the palette you might
think that orange is gonna be like boom
but it's actually a really nice pretty
soft orange everyday color a long phrase
but yeah I'm trying to describe it as
best as I can
so you doesn't get a thorough review but
I love Wednesday Wednesday it's so pink
on Wednesdays we wear pink well pop that
on okay so next I'm taking NYX jumbo eye
pencil again and I took some on the back
of my hand I just kind of like scribbled
across it I'm gonna take this winged
liner brush from dose of color instant
and I'm gonna kind of do like some
crease carving or lid carving or it's
increased carving we're gonna do some
carving is all you need to know and I'm
gonna carve in the what he called inner
part of my eye come on Alyssa you can
talk and then I'm gonna take the
plastics which is a really nice white I
should say and the reason why emphasize
that it's nice is because sometimes
whites are hard to pull off it terms up
the color payoff whereas this one is a
really nice white like you get a nice
nice weight so if I go ahead and pack
that on I'm also going to go ahead and
take you can't sit with us just to blend
this little part right here so it's not
awkward that's a nice little blend right
there next I'm going to take in glocks
number 77 gel liner and this is a Mac
two 6-3 brush and I'm gonna create a
winged
and I go ahead and apply you can't sit
with us on a morphine for three one two
the bottom part of my eye and I'm also
going to apply Wednesday and then this
part is optional but I kind of just
wanted to add more color to the look I'm
gonna add gruel and I just want to use
that one specifically because amazing
I'm gonna pop this in my little inner
corner fluffy fold area and then we're
gonna go ahead and apply some bottom
lash mascara off-camera I went ahead and
applied some blush and a little bit of
highlight nothing too intense which is
why I didn't even your cortex and what
folks would be the eyes but I will do my
lip color on camera from the color I'm
going to take the scanty Beauty lipstick
I wanted to distance gravity and I'm
gonna go ahead and pop a clear gloss on
top okay so here we have the finished
look and just a breakdown on the palate
I'm gonna go ahead and do a breakdown I
did talk about each shadow as I was
applying if I want to get more detail
just to let you guys know my final
thoughts my favorite shades and the
palette arts
I mean basically all the matte shades
cuz I'm looking at it right now and it's
like a boom boom boom all the matte
shades I live for them you guys are
probably listening you'd even use all
the matte shades in today's tutorial I
know but I did play with them already
and I live for them especially good
cocoa because like a nice kind of brown
and you guys
I live for kind of like brownish shades
so I love the mattes in the palette my
favorite shimmers would be Regina George
because when you look at Regina George
it looks not as like I don't know do you
miss those shadows were like blue I'm
gonna use that
when I saw 14 of George I didn't think
that
but then upon doing a little swatch and
then like swipe it on my hand it's such
an interesting shadow because it has a
pinky gold vibe to it that's really
pretty it really kind of like
two-dimensional that's really cool so it
really shocked me when I used it
yesterday and then you have cool mom and
cool mom is a really nice soft blue that
I liked as well but my favorite I would
say out of all the shimmers it's
definitely gruel only because it's such
a nice green the only thing I would say
about rule though is that the texture of
it is different and the other shimmers
in the palette and it's a little bit
chunky so you want to be mindful when
applying it because it will have some
fallout but aside from that the color
itself is really pretty overall I think
the palette is great I definitely can
see you getting some really nice
dramatic looks and really nice everyday
looks with the palette even though I
first glance it looks a little crazy
because you see gruel you see just pink
you see all that stuff so it's
intimidating but when you play with it
you see that it definitely has potential
cuz even this look is softer than the
look I did yesterday
and I'm pretty shy to go even softer so
there's a lot of versatility and there's
a lot of creativity in this palette
alone and honestly if you don't even do
shadow I think the concept of a freaking
burn book as a palette is amazing and I
would have gotten it regardless even if
I wasn't gonna create looks because I
mean it's so I mean we love Mean Girls I
don't know to explain that we love
meeting girls so that is it for this
video I will not ramble but let me know
in the comments section down below if
you plan on grabbing the palette or if
you're gonna skip out on it or if you're
gonna wait a little bit are you excited
let me know your thoughts on the palette
but yeah that is it I'm sorry for
talking so much thank you guys so much
