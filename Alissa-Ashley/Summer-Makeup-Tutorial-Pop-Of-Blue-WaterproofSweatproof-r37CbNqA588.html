today's tutorial is going to be on this
fun summery look I use waterproof and
sweat proof products or products that I
know last of the day so if I recommend
to you guys you're talking so much my
hands we stop and I just try to make it
really nice in sweat proof and I've been
getting a lot of suggestions to do
something like this so I want to make it
very nice and fun because I know I'm
just a basic look like last week so like
okay I got a come with the heat so
that's why I try to do some of you guys
like it and yeah um I'll have anything
else to say so where is it in the toriel
I feel like I was supposed to say
something if I figure it out I'll write
down below but let's just jump to the
tutorials and I can't figure out well
good thing okay so the first thing we do
is go ahead and spray my face with my
skin Canadian makeup primer spray this
is one my favorite primers of all time
and I'm going to take my benefit
Porefessional and this is Matt rescue
and it's a gel consistency and it's not
really too silicone II which I
absolutely hate I hate crime as I have
with a lot of silicone and so we do
slippery on my skin I like them to have
it absorb in my skin
I'd like it just around it's such well
cut it away or it a good pop go on
better that way for foundation I'm gonna
take my cover FX natural finish oil-free
foundation and this is just the perfect
foundation for me you guys know I love
it
and it's just
so thumbs up why this all over my skin
and I like this foundation because it's
not really dewy but it's not really
matte either it's just a really nice
natural finish the name says it all and
I'm going to blend it out with a Beauty
Blender to conceal I'm going to take my
Too Faced Born suede concealer and I
have been using this for the past couple
days aside from yesterday because I was
just like I don't like wear makeup but I
got them in the mail and I just love
them I tried them out our day were like
80 degrees and it literally did not
budge whatsoever
it just gives such a nice natural finish
and I just yeah I'm really feeling this
concealer and this is a shade medium so
I'm going to mix in another shade
actually because medium is too light but
the other shade is a little bit too dark
for my preference so mix them together
gives my ideal highlight shade the other
shade is deep tan and I'm going to blend
it out my Beauty Blender
I'm also going to use the shape deep
just to contour I have been loving it
because it reminds me of my dark
chocolate bronzer and love to face if
you are here all the time you know I use
it all time
next I'm going to set my under eye in
place on my Laura Mercier powder and I'm
going to try to do this quickly so I
don't get any creasing
and then for the rest of my face I'm
going to take my Maybelline shine-free
powder and this is the medium one get a
bunch of it and the freakin top I'm just
going to place on my face I love this
powder it is my favorite drugstore
powder is like four dollars they have a
light one as well the lighting reminds
me more of the Laura Mercier powder
because it's like the same tint but for
the rest of my face I don't like it to
be too light so I use the medium
okay the first thing to go ahead and
fill in my brow I'm going to take my
Anasazi a dip brow because it's
waterproof and it stays in place all day
and I'm going to apply it my number 22
Sephora brush I'm go ahead and conceal
like I always do with my mac studio
finish concealer and then to prime my
eye I'm going to use the Urban Decay
primer potion and this is Eden and you
guys know that I've been feeling this
lately and yeah it will stay on all day
it has stayed on all day for me which is
why I love it so much and I'm going to
blend it in with my morphe 27 brush and
then for extra assurance I'm just going
to set in place like always with a loose
powder
it's the Laura Mercier leas pattern same
one I have under my eyes I'm moving into
eye shadow I'm going to take the violet
Voss holy grail palette and I'm taking
the shade hashtag in my Judy's place 125
blender brush and I'm just going to
place this all in my crease area
and I'm going to switch over to a 1:27
blending brush also by dubious place in
my makeup ich Morocco gonna place that
right on top next I'm gonna take my Mac
mixing medium lighter and just place
that all over my lid and I'm going to
take color drains pumpkin-pie eyeshadow
and just place that all on top let me go
ahead and create a nice bold winged I
decided to do a winged because I want to
include my favorite liner for waterproof
which is a cap on pain trooper liner and
I also just want spices up except for
doing and then for mascara I'm going to
take the Makeup Forever aqua smoky
extravagant mascara and it is waterproof
and I'm just going to do a late coat
from mascara and if relaxed I'm taking
Lily lashes in stock on for the bottom
half my eye I decided to do something
fun I'm going to take the Sephora
this is in the shade my boyfriend jeans
it's a waterproof pencil after that
places all my waterline and then once
it's kind of in there I'm going to take
my zoeva two to six smudger brush and
just smudge it out and then it doesn't
really have to be set in place but to up
the vibrancy I'm going to take mega
Peaks Neptune which is a really nice
pretty blue shade
and I'm going to take benefits they're
real mascara and this is the new one and
I'm just going to cut my bottom lashes
okay so now let's go ahead and add some
color into our skin I'm going to take my
benefit hoola bronzer first in my morphe
brush I got a whole set of these Badawi
brushes and I'm just like okay it's time
to use these the soap freaking amazing
now go ahead and take my Too Faced dark
chocolate Soleil bronzer and go ahead
and just runs up and a switch brushes
it's another bedazzled one to contour my
nose I'm going to take my new more B
blush palette and yeah my lighting is
too bright you can't see it but i
swatched two of the shades on my snap
and I'm really gonna wear one of them
cuz it's so so pretty yes it's so pretty
imma go ahead and add my anastacio so
Hollywood illuminator and this is a
morphe fan brush but I've had it for
like a mere two years I do not own the
name
and I honestly don't know what lip color
to do so I'm going to take over
cosmetics mocha once I got the flow here
I'm going to Dubai and I'm also gonna
take a little bit of Brooklyn
and the last thing we do is take my
L'Oreal infallible setting spray gave my
some nice little spritz I realize I
forgot to hide my little flappy's so
imma take my morphe EMV 19 fresh and my
Laura Lee palette I'm taking shale
arleigh I'm just going to highlight
highlight highlight and then I feel like
my eyes that's just incomplete someone
take my morphe in three to six brush and
I'm just going to connect the bottom to
the lower half of the wing okay so
here's the finished look I really like
how it turned out
I just wanted something more vibrant and
fun and not boring because sometimes I
know that I tend to be repetitive so
I'll handle two blue here and they will
like it so oh you guys too if you do be
sure to give it a thumbs up and let me
know what else you like to see other
than that thank you so much for watching
and I'll see you guys soon and I don't
gotta say it
