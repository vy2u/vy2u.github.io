for today's video I'm gonna show you
guys how to do a winged eyeliner using
cream eyeliner because it's a whole
nother level of levels
you guys wanna learn keep by watching ok
so starting with my cream eyeliner and
my brush I'm gonna go ahead and start in
the center I like to do this because I
like to pull the product outwards and
inwards versus inwards and outwards if
that makes sense because sometimes I
pick up too much product and if I start
with all that product in the inner
corner as you can imagine it might not
go the best because I'm gonna get all
that builds that with product in the
inner corner so I like to just start in
the center and move my way to the inner
part of my eye and the outer part of my
eye lining the lash line and so it's
nice and black I also like to use my
angled brush to push my lashes downwards
as you can see I'm doing so if you have
curly lashes that's a great tip for you
use your brush and push them downwards
do not try to just work on your wing
with your lash in the way because it may
get a little disastrous so you want to
pull them downwards with your brush very
gently now that my wing already know
where I want to be so I'm taking more
product and I'm just going to slowly
edge it out very very slowly wanting
your time with this and then I'm going
to go in the opposite direction and
notice how my brush changed directions
with the product and with my hand
movements and I'm going to then fill in
the base of my wing with the rest of the
product but moving the brush in the
direction where you're pulling the
product is so important see how I'm
going inwards now and my brush flipped
you want to make sure that your brush is
going along with you that's so important
now to thicken my wing I'm gonna pull
the wing inwards and this is very
important because if you do it outwards
and you think about it you may
accidentally make your wing too big
you're gonna a me Winehouse wing it was
poppin for her she's an icon but maybe
not for us and then when I get to the
inner part I'm gonna pull it outwards
because I don't want to pull it too
inwards because then the inner part may
be too thick and I have much more
control pulling it outwards
come to the inner part of the I hope
that makes it and for a hooded eye I
like the inner part to be the thinner
part because if I make it too thick then
it's just gonna overpower my eye and
then after that I'm gonna go ahead and
just take my brush dry and I'm just
going over the wing because the product
is still more wet in some areas than
others so I just want that to dry down
evenly and then taking a really skinny
felt tip liner brush I'm going to go
into that little tiny part of the wing
because I don't want to go in with my
brush because again I do not want to
risk overdoing the wing and making it
too huge so going in with the liner
brush is usually the safest way to
finish off your wing and make it nice
and sharp I'm also gonna make sure to
get really really into that little outer
corner that you see because I want this
to be a black nice beautiful wing and
then I am done with my wing I hope you
guys found this video helpful like you
