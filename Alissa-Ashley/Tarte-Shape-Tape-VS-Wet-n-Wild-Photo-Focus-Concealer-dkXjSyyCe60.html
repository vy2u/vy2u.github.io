so in today's video we're going to be
comparing another product last week I
did a $5 powder versus a $50 powder and
this week based on you guys's requests
I'm going to go ahead and compare the
tart shape taste versus the wet wild
photo focus concealer because a lot of
you guys have heard of these are dupes
or similar so we're going to be testing
this out Tuesday so if you want to see
my comparison then just keep on watching
I'm talking very fast slow down okay so
like always when I go ahead and do our
base makeup we're going to go ahead and
prime with our Milani prime light primer
crap my brows going to disappear new
when we just wipe them up in a pin then
I went to breakfast Darnell so I had
doing some brows my face is completely
clear but I guess my brows are my
security blanket so I'm using brown for
breakfast those brows for breakfast and
then for foundation we're gonna use the
Make Up For Ever Ultra HD sticks and I
lost both of the cap yay me so just this
one favorite foundation so I'm go ahead
and use this this is shade y 4 4 5 and I
mix it with Y 505 and I'll go ahead and
take this morphe g8 to blend this out
like I mentioned in another video this
g8 is clone eyes foundation okay so now
for our concealer I was lower tech and
today I'm going to go ahead and take the
tart shape tape first I'm going to shade
kin-san I used to use the shape tan but
then everyone loses hands and enhanced
and is a little more better for my skin
tone because of the yellow undertone so
it looks better
I'm go ahead and use that so it will try
one in my eye I'm going to go ahead and
blend this out and this the Tarte
lending sponge which if you guys been
watching my latest videos you guys my
favorite blending sponge at the moment
it is soy saw
and then before any creasing takes place
when I take another quickie blending
sponge and take my cap on the golden
powder we got that in place
taking the c34 brush right go ahead and
dust with the remaining powder look like
a crazy person and look go ahead and fix
that okay so go ahead and do the one
wild side and the X we have not tried
these yet some will be interested to see
I swatch it on my hand a little bit to
get the color correctly but I have not
used under the eye look see this is a
shade this is deep but I say this what's
deep deep an oh it feels really good and
then we're going to mix in medium peach
trying to get to next other side get
pretty good match I'm going to go ahead
and blend this out let's see how it
blends that's nice
that's really nice let me go into my
mirror frizzle mirror and this looks
really nice yeah definitely I definitely
see why people are calling it a shape
tape do because in a way it's kind of
seeming to blend out the same it have
that kind of same not overly creamy kind
of consistency about it it's hard to
explain the tape shapes consistency it's
like it's not how to explain it it's
creamy without being slippery this class
feels the same way where it's creamy but
it's not slippery and it covers really
nicely
go ahead and set it with the exact same
powder so I keep my eye wide so I don't
crease up
amra got decimated with the same brush
and away this time I'm seeing brighter
and then we look absolutely crazy let me
go ahead and set the rest of my face and
I'll be right back okay so you can see I
went ahead and made my son with decent
as the brows the colored contour all I
just stuff you look normal and here you
have it I do want to go ahead and share
some observations that I made while
studying this sign is my first time
using the wet and wild concealer like I
mentioned and the first thing I noticed
was that this side has more of a pop to
at the mid sides and I think it's
because I used the peach concealer and
Peach usually brightened so that's just
something I want to you know mention to
you guys to this side seemed a little
bit brighter and actually like that
element about it because of the nice
frightening is kind of a warmer
brightening whereas this side doesn't
really have that and I've never had
anything compared to so I never noticed
this I didn't have that but this side I
like a little bit better because of that
little brightening element in that more
warm element and yeah aside from that
both sides look essentially identical to
be completely honest with you
they both set really well I don't have
any cakey or dry under-eye feeling on
either side whatsoever I'm looking right
now to see it in topics please you guys
but no dry feeling both sides are pretty
nice no creasing going on and I decide
to not wear in the eyeshadow because I
want to focus strictly on the concealer
look at so far so good
and let's go ahead to a time check right
now it is 11:40 we're going to go ahead
and we're going to keep this on our face
for at least six to eight hours and I'm
going to come back with you guys just
like the last video and let you know and
show you guys and all that stuff how
they kept up and which side overall
looks better so I go ahead and just do
my do and I will be back with you guys
later my nail just ripped off in the
most painful way ever and I want to cry
oh my god in result it like it's perfect
right here and it burns so freakin back
my back
I mean it is the day and I'll show you
guys the time it is now focus multiple
come on here right here that's now 942 I
have been out and today we're quite the
day I'm right tired made me ready like
that's like a track for our hoof amazing
but um yes the day was quite interesting
and here is how we are looking and the a
my form is kind of oily but uh in terms
under I oh look another nail popped off
earlier today was a day in terms of the
concealer then look at the slope I mean
hope I'm pretty person well like they
stayed on both sides were killing today
now I will say on the heart side and one
point a day I had a little line right
here and it's a dry line and I get that
often with shape tape and just I just
corrected by taking like a spray like
this what hyaluronic acid in it
is that our I guess it I think this one
does I pick any hydrating spray and I
just sprayed on my face whenever I do
get a little line because sometimes it
happened with shave tape and I think
that's why some people do not like use
it under eye but I just kind of work
with it whenever it does happen
doesn't that all the time only sometimes
I guess depends on my skin that day but
this side stays pretty solid yes my
final verdict for this is that on a
plate neither side is the winner I think
that it's kind of a solid tie you go
seeing how they held up and I think the
both sides look great so I guess you
could say that you want to splurge on
the shape tapes and I would say go for
it is a great concealer and if you want
to save and get the wet while it's a
mock consumer as well I'm actually
really feeling the wet and wild went a
lot like yeah I mean it both look really
great you haven't seen your first hand
me a closer they both were pretty good
then a good job and it was currently
both okay too
so that is it for this little comparison
