little area we're doing I want to try a
bunch of makeup that claims to last long
I'm sure if you have done these kind of
deals before but I want to try it
because a lot of these cause I've never
tried before so it to be me to meet her
pretty French try it we're to go to
Sephora we're going to see in 24 hours
you say hmm
I don't folks we got it good tape where
I was going in this one and it this one
is allegedly let's see this one says 59
Zippy's washes is the most popular I got
the last one
in black vehicle water first yeah all
righty we're getting this waterproof
rear choices okay girls that actually
have some Beauty bakery this is our home
so I'm going to put this Smashbox funnel
back because I want side vb3 because I'm
trying to get and you guys already know
that they're known to be like super
long-lasting so I'll do that
I'm Thomas for summer like cream
eyeshadows is pretty
it's pretty hard for hell expensive yep
$45 that's a lot of money that's so
pretty
oh my god my color Sonia
hey I grab everything that I think I
need in order to army give the video
done time with this stuff to make sure
either thing I hope I do and I don't I
probably out at a home on a tweet but I
just want to try and like new stuff
because what I want to repair them and
everything to the game line then we're
going to see like some licenses I'm not
looking forward to be able to do is I'm
really not play will be favoring but
explain here you might old you guys and
American soldiers scary okay wait
let's make up Spencer why I mean it's
worth it for like
Meech thank you all right so we have our
makeup now and yeah I mean I'm filming
this like a day ahead and I'm going to
wake up super early in the morning so
that we have like a full at least 12
hours to see how it works so I guess
I'll see you guys in the morning
bye okay so it is 754 and by the way yes
I do for my own self as my lock screen
because whatever I put but I have my
Sephora bag and yes I want a hammer
yesterday and then to go to hand though
but I got some good set my hope cement
are freaking tired I'm going to start
out with the hourglass mineral primer
and I got the tiny one I don't know if
you guys knew that but you guys me it's
a little tiny small one if you're just
trying it out because almost got a big
bottle and I'm like why would I do that
it's my first time trying we're going to
like it a little tiny sample size one
anyway I apply that to my skin my first
time trying to primer it is a little as
silicone your thought it would because
we're our reason I thought that it would
like feel like a lot of pure Kong I hate
primers that go that way but exactly
does it feel that way that's it in this
I'm going to try the Smashbox Studios
skin 15 hour we're hydrating foundation
oil free and I got to change 4.0 I'm
hoping that is a slip match first we're
trying Smashbox foundation gonna shake
it potentially watery let's see
don't shake it no but it says it is
media subpool buildable covers oil-free
controls oil all day we have to see
about the nose sweat humidity it's
exercising resistance color true and
transfer resistant dim I matte finish
I'm going to shake it up a little bit
because it seems a little bit liquidy on
my hand and let's just see it makes
difference okay go ahead fly it it looks
a little yellow I'm gonna burn it out or
like a yellow orange but I'm going it
out honestly speaking I'd rather it be
yellow than it'd be great so glad I have
that problem because with a lot of
foundations made great up on these like
most of you saying okay it doesn't
matter if one job okay cool now for
concealer I got their studio skin 20
for our water from concealer we're going
to try that as well entertain mediums
darts I'm hoping that that's a good
match this one very soft and shape the
concealer - how many body seems a little
watery so we're going to see it alright
so that was doing my nose itching so
back and then I go ahead and set it in
place with the cover FX perfect perfect
profitting perfect setting powder and
I'm use this you can I know that works
well and yeah I play the power guy knows
the sexiest so it is it like it is a
mess up almost up you know I mean now
we're taking our for a microscope powder
in the shape tan and this is a morphe 58
and not like how these Smashbox and zero
is set too much not really my fav
usually like - a little more hydrated
and it kind of has this texture about it
underneath yeah it's not really not
loving how it looks photo not for brows
I'm using the hourglass brow sculpting
pencil and let's see it's been on
display that it's supposed to be long
lasting so that's why I picked it up and
I want to also try it because a little
angle to it looks really nice and pretty
go ahead and use it on my brows now I'm
going to go ahead and prime my eyes
using Smashbox 24-hour photo finish
shadow primer and I got the last one in
stock eyes okay like this must work
really good because it was none on the
shelves and I've to have or check the
drawer and there's one left
I'm gonna just apply it directly to the
eye okay so for Ison they take this busy
arts and I've had to get this little
palette it's comp Theory six shades
palette I'm gonna go ahead and take this
shade right here first this same work
p.m. 5:18
we're going to see how this climber
works usually I set my primer but it
cannot instruct me to do so so but I
mean the color above it is showing up
really good actually
alright is a blimp out pretty nicely as
well the primer isn't stiff at all I'm
digging this I'm really doing this
I think the Mac makes a medium liner if
you have hooded eyes or I mean if you
have any eye shape so mainly for hooded
eyes use a mixing medium they have when
I mix as well and just apply a little
thin layer of it first and then your eye
shadow and then seal it with a new
medium and it will not budge all right
still dry just a little bit but I'm go
ahead and do my liner and this is the
only product that I bought yesterday
that re tried before and I bought in a
bunch times already but this is the Kat
Von D tattoo liner and I just bought
this because I know it works good and if
I mascara I was told to try the Diorshow
iconic and this is the waterproof one
and this in the shade over black so
we're going to try this today I'm going
go ahead and add a little bit of
eyeshadow to the bottom lashes
all right through the bottom lashes the
bottom lash line now for blush I'm
taking this Make Up For Ever HD flush
disco blush cream and it's number three
three five I'm taking this because I
mean creams are known to last longer
anyway so we're put the cream on there
for bronze I'm taking this Amazonian
clay matte waterproof bronzer in hotel
areas and new to me as well
and it is both being water
so renew that mmm smells good
and therefore highlight I couldn't
really find one that I prove to do
anything so I'm gonna take the one that
I've been loving recently and this is
max - Roger glow I don't think they sell
it anymore but it's so gorgeous
a little bit of that so we're going to
use this e bakery wanna see Oscar hey I
mean this is their liquid and this is
triple berry roots I just went -
voiceover first what he called a
chapstick on it
and then I add it in this card this is
your up to it I'm going to set my makeup
in place with the Urban Decay all
nighter that's a little travel-size come
on see if I like it or not just already
had it but we're going to unsprayed
anyway now to go ahead and do my hair
get dressed and I saw my lashes but
they're in the car on my dash because I
took them off on D so actually I guess
this little bit as important as well I'm
using the House of lashes lash glue and
I mean I guess you can see like how that
keeps up I want to include that in there
because I know you guys always I know
like well ask when you think so yeah
that is it and these are Lena lashes in
the style Naomi alright so I want to
hand in by her and I spotted sweater
give me a chill day and yeah maybe a
quick little update before I start the
day
so the concealer area looks much better
after spraying and setting my face it
kind of set a little bit more so it
doesn't look as tech streaks at first it
was looking very very dry so I'm hoping
that dryness does not come back during
the middle of the day because sometimes
that happen but happy free face looks
good for now and then it comes back so
that doesn't happen
let's see what else the lips still a
little bit sticky but I mean it looks
good it feels okay like it's not too
sticky and I think I think to do this I
can to do with this I think you can do
lose everything looks pretty good
everything's nice and max sir and see
how at last let's do this get started
I'm hungry
so let's go who's not devastated because
I just left my sandwich and my lipstick
on I already did messed up and the way I
eat I take little bits and pieces of Sam
tonight I because I don't bite into it
because I can't because I these are so
temporary veneers so basically they'll
pop out if I did that so I really ate it
and took my time making sure that I
didn't I'm s ellipse and we got some uh
yeah yeah I can't even drink my smoothie
without this stuff coming off I'd be
able to take a look off and maybe
reapply it but yeah this is yeah it's
not comfortable
nothing so yeah I'm not really feeling
it Oh some puppy 11:00 news if I have
the beard think but I dive into a reflex
eventually because I'm Shawn so my games
seven four four so when you go ahead
just me in there who is room i nose
makeup though fella
alrighty so some of the piercing in and
it kind of hurt oh my god I start really
washed up I can't hurt because I guess
my comments shrunken or whatever the
word is and he's like put in police we
make it the proper size so that's done
by the makeup is okay I was like the
makeup okay so we're good to go so now I
can walk around some more I really know
where I want to go on sleep but I'm just
trying to fill my dance with stuff so
that we can really see the wear but it's
sunny so that's a good thing because we
live to see the last of the Sun you know
sometimes I get oily or when it's all
funny and stuff it's hot so good this is
good so yeah I second with you guys my a
couple hours I don't wanna know you I
talking too much
alrighty so quick update click update I
got this lipstick at Sephora it's a
cream stain collection and it's lasting
pretty good I ate pizza and everything
and I mean it's a little bit all in the
center part but I think that what makes
it a little bit better is that it's not
crumbling off it is just a little bit
all about to reapply it but I trying to
show you guys a little egg right now but
I mean as far as my face makeup would
you like the main thing no oil is coming
off I'm tapped my nose just to kind of
see it inspect well it's saying pretty
I'm Matt and usually I'll be oily at
this time of day I'm not so we're good
we're good guess who's stuck on the
bridge and traffic and my ETA home is an
hour at least what can I get home it
will be 7 o'clock so that leaves with
like at least one more good hour two
hours to test the 12 hours or like just
kind of yeah you know if I say so Jamie
Bridge traffic let's go
alrighty so I'm back home now and hope
your time it is it is 7:00 tomorrow me
it's 722 and I mean I don't think an
extra hour will kill us eyes met we got
the general idea so go ahead and go into
the southern room and I'll share my
thoughts alrighty so it is now about
7:30 so here's what we were looking like
after about nine hours and honestly okay
let's just break down every single thing
speaking in a mirror okay so in terms of
the mascara when I'm the wind this
happened but something transfer over
here ah you guys can see it probably not
it's kind of it's not too bad but
literally a mascara guy right here let's
see what else the concealer didn't
really crease at all the concealer
actually looks pretty good it surprised
me the most because when I first started
as you guys remember to be guard yeah
you guys watch the whole thing I was
like so shading the concealer I was like
what is going on I don't know if it's a
powder incentive with I don't know but
it looks so dry and it felts so look I
want to literally stop and wash up
everything I was not feeling it at all
but in it surprising me because it looks
pretty good and it settled in pretty
flawless didn't have that dry feeling on
the day so I was really happy about that
because I was like so that looks good um
the eyeshadow primer retreated as well
now I don't know if you guys can see
right here when I was putting on my lash
I'm really got glue all right here so
don't mind that part I don't want to you
know like yes that's my fault
but I found a primer yeah he never tried
this my child still pretty good it's
pretty good the brow stayed in place
they did not sweat off forehead areas
looking good not too shiny a little bit
of Sheen on forehead just a little bit
the mouth area like right here I do see
a little bit of cracking I don't know
how to describe it it's not extreme
cracking just trust me I passed back
cracking this and I feel like and I move
my mouth it was kind of creating a
little bit of a smile line type thing
situation going on I don't normally get
that so it could be the foundation that
caused that but overall I think it looks
pretty good to be you know on my face
for about nine hours I was extremely
impressed I was not sure what to expect
especially since the foundation was
yellow the concealer was turning me off
you know it was all these factors that
really scared me and I mean anything
looks pretty well the lip color as you
can see it's not the same as when I
first you know was over here because it
ended up
yes do not work out for me and maybe
it's those specific colors because I
know that some companies there are
formulation isn't super consistence of
some colors are better than others as
you want to so try more the beauty
bakery the colors but yeah that is my
final little thing I hope you guys like
this kind of video I know it's probably
me long and edited yet as I know it's
going to be long but hope you guys
enjoyed this that different videos I'll
probably keep everything I bought by one
return I don't really like returning a
lot of stuff left I like hated so try to
keep these things that pertain to where
they may just be I like them so thank
you guys so much for watching this video
and I will I just spit hello I'm so glad
no stand in front of me because I was
