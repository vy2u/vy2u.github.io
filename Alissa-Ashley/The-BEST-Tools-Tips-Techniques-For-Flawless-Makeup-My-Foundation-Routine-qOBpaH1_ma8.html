today's video I'll be showing you guys
how to achieve an extremely flawless
foundation at base I'm going to
breakdown very thoroughly how I do my
full face when I want to be extremely
flawless and just tips and you can
include into your routine if you do not
do them already and yeah that's that's
what it remember we're doing today so
you guys want to see if and just keep on
watching okay so the first step to
achieving a flawless face is priming
your face to prime today I'm taking this
Sicily double thumbs for primer and I'm
gonna use my hands to rub this in I
don't apply prime I own the anyone
applies prior with a brush or bun or
anything it's best if I with your hands
just really get in there and give a
primer that's more on the liquidy side
make sure that you allow it to dry down
just a little bit to get it nice and
sticky you do not want a dome primer and
then boom foundation you want to do that
primer a little bit of time to dry down
so it's nice and tacky to apply your
foundation because otherwise when you
apply it too soon there's a mixed
together and it's just yes not going to
be decorated let's just so make sure you
let it dry down a little bit for
foundation I'm using my foundation day
two I promise not everything can you
lose you I promise but some of that
stuff I tried was just so good I have to
use it this is a ton for waterproof
foundation it doesn't necessarily matter
I mean it does matter but then again you
don't have to use any of the process
that I'm specifically using it's all in
the technique so it doesn't matter if
using a $2.00 combination it's all on
your technique obviously may not last as
long but it will look good we personally
don because you're putting it on
correctly so I'm gonna go ahead and take
my foundation I put it on my back hands
the back of my hand first and act like a
dot on my face for blending out
foundations I kind of it really depends
on my mood usually I would use a
blending sponge my favorite blend Clark
it is so dirty is the Tarte quickie
blending sponge it is so much better in
the Beauty Blender so much better than
any other sponge I've tried it's just so
soft so this would be the sponge are
used to blend or I can use this morphe
import 3:9 that has probably freaking
cat hair on it
AM or PM 439 I've noticed that with all
my morphe brushes is consistently the
one that I like to use for buffing a
foundation it just kind of works well
with every foundations I've tried to
bust out with it unlike some of the
other ones that are more black this one
seems the best one so I'm gonna go ahead
and blend on one side with this and the
other side with a sponge just two guys
and see it just because go ahead and let
them move out and I'll go ahead and take
this sponge just split out this part and
as you can see it has a little bit of
pigmentation right here not enough to be
doing the most do a color correcting
anymore
because actually lightened up a bit but
I do have a little bit I'm gonna take a
little bit more guy foundation I take a
thin layer first and then just take a
little bit up a little scar right here
start right here see right here and I'm
just going to go ahead and blend out the
sponge for concealer I would definitely
say that my favorite concealer that I
always go back to that I've been going
back to for at least into three years is
the NARS radiant creamy concealer so I'm
going to take the shade biscuit and I'm
just going to apply a little bit my
forehead
a little bit under the eye and I'm gonna
go ahead and blend this out with my
tarts sponge going to the eyes what I
like to do I'm blending out my under I
like to bounce back and forth and I
learned to bounce back and forth I'm
going at the mirror by the way I learned
about second fourth to avoid having one
eyes look more blossom the other as
opposed to blending out one eye and then
the next I do them both back and forth
so they're nice and even because
sometimes yeah I get more consider on
one eye but doing this I find gives me
more of us successful chance of not
having that happen then okay as you can
see it's kind of creeping up in my nose
which I do not want a lot to do on my
nose and if I continue to blend it she's
going to go onto my hair so I'm gonna
take mine
back in and just kind of DAB off the
sponge a little bit to get any excess
concealer off it and then I'll go ahead
and complete the blend you don't want to
blend this two up because it's a little
crazy you want to control it so that's
right under there where you need it to
be where you're planning to be so if the
earth feel like your sponge just has a
little bit too much frogs and they're
kind of blending out just dab it off and
as you can see I'm controlling with
concealer goes more now to see how if I
were to kept blending it a bit all up
here I'm controlling it by kind of
bouncing it inwards a little bit too and
on a nose area I kind of to just kind of
travel it into the eye because that part
will probably wipe drop anyway with my
prying we've got a little bit by the
mouth area because last thing you want
is just a concealer and then like the
mouth area does kind of like a look when
it's not be involved so while I do is
take the remainder I'll just blend it
right like that
what I'm doing right now not to the
point where it's all over my mouth but
just a little bit seamless so that it
doesn't look all divided this is to set
my piloted areas I have been lovingly
make revolution banana powder I like a
banana powder because I have more of a
yellow undertone so just as yellow it
just works with my undertone it
brightens me and I just love this powder
glowing eight freaking dog at Ulta so
I'll go ahead and dump some out and then
before I go and work on setting I like
to make sure that any creasing under
here it's a little bit but there's still
some there because if you do not blend
up those creasing before you set your
under-eye you're set increasing so you
want to make sure that you go in before
you dip into your powder and make sure
that it is nice and blended so I'm
Michael a little crazy to come up and be
like drag along but I want to make sure
that once I win them out they're blended
out and I'm going sit
so once I have that initial layer on if
I have to I will go back in will have a
secondary baking layer and I have to put
this powder into where my eyes are
potentially creeps up to make sure that
my whole under eye is nice and set and I
will not have creasing issues I'm
pushing it upwards I'll go ahead and do
my forehead this part is kind of easy
nothing too extreme and then what I like
to do I'm going to set my face with
another powder but if you guys ever
noticed I like to set around my mouth
with this powder as well even though
there's no concealer around I do not
highlight my mouth area
I like uses powder because my mouth area
tends to get a little bit darker due to
the discoloration ice melt in my mouth
area you know it gets a little bit
darker so I like to take my brightening
powder or on my mouth area so it doesn't
happen I find that if I were to set my
mouth area with my other powder it kind
of created darkness around here and I
don't like that because you know
obviously looks weird
so I'll set my whole mouth area with
this banana powder Dan for my face
powder
we're gonna go booze again this is the
YSL was it souffle the crop powder go
ahead and take my sponge and I'm taking
this powder because I love it
thank you Jeff you're putting me on but
any loose powder with a tint or even it
doesn't have to have a tint it can be
the laura mercier translucent I just
personally do not like using powders
that are just completely white
I do not like use those powders I find
that what I do I become have this like
gray cap on me so every powder I use for
my face has a tint to it and I'm just
going to pack this into my skin there is
light layer though now once I have that
powder on I'm going to go in with my
holy grill combo if you need anything in
your life to make your face freakin
flawless even if it's just like without
any of these products of heaven right
now
you need visa for microcement powder and
you guys bob is coming in
be more be e58 I'm explained why I like
them both for one the e58 if you look at
it it's a fluffy brush but it's kind of
you know dense and has an angle to it
which allows us to be perfect onto your
face I found that using this brush
increases the flawlessness of our makeup
versus using a big fluffy brush guy you
use big fluffy brushes and I mean
obviously while these still look nice
since this one is so much more as dense
and has that angle it's so much more
precise and it really really really gets
approximation to the skin as opposed to
just kind of buffing on layer this one
just makes it everything lasts long so
if you need one more P brush in your
life that you will only or morphe brush
I would definitely d8 because I cannot
live without this brush if I do not have
Express with me my makeup just does not
look the same and in the Sephora micro
smooth what I learned about this is that
whenever I do not use it I get a lot of
smile line creasing and I think it's
because the powder is so feel finest
micro smooth that it kind of gets into
the little crevices that for whatever
reason these other powders I use do not
get into so once I take this you know
nice and flat I take this and I just
buff it over everything I end up looking
so flawless one skip this step it is not
the same I can you're not a kid you're
not I love this powder because it's not
a super thick powder as you can see it's
not changing the color it's not making
it look more cakey it's literally such a
fine powder it's perfect to get into any
little crease that did not get filled
with all other products on our face this
is like the final step it seals
everything in and I like it because I
have a little tint to it so it's just
perfect and it's perfect
like it is everything that I would want
in a powder so see now my face looks
really nice and smooth and this is a
color and being all good the next step
will be to I am going to set my face now
I like to set my face two separate times
and I'll explain why I'm I think this
Too Faced hangover primer
really honestly all I need is a spray
there's no specific reason as to why I'm
using this spray ice I can spray myself
down and the reason why my display
myself down after doing all this is
because okay it's fresh on my face so if
I spray it it's going to easily sink
into my skin now sometimes people like
to spray their faithful to go with their
entire application but I find that I
look extra flawless when I spray after
all this powering layer and then I go to
the other stuff and I spray one more
time
it looks good I'm gonna go ahead and
spray you don't have to do it but this
is what I like to do and we go ahead and
do it in stop talking I'm spray
everything and then what I was doing
I'll take the flat part of my sponge and
just press everything in make sure you
go under your eye as well because
sometimes the spray doesn't really hit
under eye but you want to make sure it
does because I've noticed that what I
forget to hit the under eye it could
potentially end up being a little bit
drier than every other area of my face
if I do not hit it with this spray now
to contour I'm going to take this becca
multi-tasking perfecting powder and I
like this powder because it's kind of a
mixture between a warm toned powder in a
cool tone I don't like going to cool
town on my powders when it comes to
contouring even though it does create a
shadow and that's simple because usually
when I do that and then I layer on my
bronzer it ends up looking great because
of that cool foam factor so I like to
take a powder that kind of mixture so
I'm not getting anything too long to the
point of orange but I'm also getting
something that's a little bit more cool
you need and I get to take my morphe for
I like this brush and I mean I use it
Presley every single video when I do a
face routine because it's just a nice
angled brush dust it off i second dip
into it def it off I like start like
about right here and then I push it
upwards you never want to go downwards
you want to push upwards first and then
go back and forth if he goes downwards
you might end up getting too close in
here and that's not gonna look good
okay amber to my nose contour after I
finish with the cheek area I'm not going
to do my forehead because as you can see
it kind of already has a broadly look to
it based on me put in the highlight
right there
and I'm going to do a little bit my chin
just a little bit you don't want to go
to OD under the chin and then for my
nose I've missed this before my favorite
nose contour brush is from morphe in 5
to 4 and I'm going to start from right
here and just continue to push it down
as you can see we're looking crazy but
that is okay we're not going to leave
like this this is a graphic that Eph I'm
going to sweep over it now to finish
bronzing up to face I'm going to switch
over to the morphe m40 - I've been
loving this brush lately to kind of add
some bronze because a little more fluffy
then the e4 so it's going to guilt just
get it nice and diffused diffused
bronzes and I'm taking my Chanel powder
this is a healthy glow powder now for
blush I'm gonna go ahead and cream blush
and powder blush and the reason why I'm
doing that is because it's going to last
longer I'm going to take this NYX bright
idea illuminating stick in the shade
coral met a crowd magnifique
so that's what it is I'm pronouncing it
so wrong now I'll go ahead and take two
fingers and really warm it up nice onto
my fingers and then I'm go ahead and Pat
it off a little bit because you know you
don't want to go in and just you know
accidentally put too much product in and
I'm going to stiffen up my cheek and
just a plate take a little bit more you
want to just gradually don't want it
going with a bunch of products because
then you'd end up like a mess and then I
go ahead and take my Fiat London dewy
sticks I'm gonna go ahead and apply this
but the same kind of stick but this is a
highlight stick I'm going to apply that
kind of right on top of the blush area
for blush I'm taking this on saw see a
blush trio and I'm going to take the
shade Miami which is a this one and
ginger and mix them together and then
say more feet eg3 I
- eg three because kind of love you but
flat as well I'm going to tack on ever
so lightly just like that for my
highlights dancing in my Joey skinny
disc is completely broken so here you
have it and I'm going to use a morphe 61
if you notice the pattern most of the
morphe brushes that i've used have come
from the elite collection and that is
because in my personal opinion that is
the best collection of brushes that more
be has I just I think that in terms of
quality those are the best ones
obviously there's other ones that you
know are hidden little gems that kind of
pop out that are great too but this
collection in particular is the best one
so I would definitely recommend if you
do invest in more fee based brushes get
the elite collection because those are
that one is the best one
I'm gonna go ahead just tap on top of my
broken highlight kind of patting it
first and once you get it on you go
ahead and sweep there for my nose taking
this morphe e14 go ahead and just take a
little bit of highlight apply it to the
little point of my nose and then apply
it to right here I want that to be more
precise so that's why I stick this brush
and that's the edges so you don't get
any harsh little lines now that I have
all this on we'll go ahead and spray my
face one more time just let that sing it
to my skin but this time instead of
patting it in and uniting to do that I'm
gonna drive down I'll go ahead into my
brows and everything and I'll be right
back okay so here we have the final look
as women throw on some lashes my brows a
lip color just really simple because I
want to go through the face because that
we just finished and as you can see
everything just looks really nice it
looks nicely blended there's no harsh
line right here there's no clear
division between my contour my blessing
my highlights everything looks very
seamless and that is what I always try
to aim for when joy makeup because I
don't want to look like on a face chart
you know where everything is separate
you do not want to look like that you
nice and blended but yeah that is how I
achieve my super flawless space in my
opinion it's all about the tools you use
obviously I'm using good products and
it's important to find products that
work for your specific skin type so
don't all out and buy a to enjoy primers
you don't need it it's what you're using
it's working for you then use that but
this tribe didn't techniques and maybe
upgrade your tools to different brushes
and sponges they're tools that you're
using to apply the makeup is just as
important as a makeup you're using
because if you think good stuff a bad
tool it's not to look like this Michael
it's flawless
so hope you guys learn something and if
you did be sure to give this video a big
thumbs up and let me know if you guys
have any other questions I didn't
clarify in the video other best and you
guys so much for watching and yeah I'll
see you guys next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
