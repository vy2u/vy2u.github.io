the BH Cosmetics and it's my ray-ray
eyes shadow palette and this year they
gave us a palette it also has contour
shades as well as highlights and they
also gave us a nine piece brush set and
I love BH Cosmetics because they're very
affordable and I love Rea because she
also offers affordable makeup tutorials
as well as mega comparisons and other
cool videos and we're gonna aim for a
bright eye look today like Patricia
bright who is also an amazing creator
here on YouTube and this eye look is
bold like Shalom black who is so bold
and confident everything that she does
and I admire her so much
I'm gonna go ahead and continue to work
on my eye shadow and I'm gonna repeat
the same steps on the bottom part of the
eye and another content creator who
creates amazing eyes she'll looks on
here is Yuki you guys should check out
her channel as you can see her eye
shadow is poppin next for mascara I'm
taking Maybelline's big shot mascara and
what makes this mascara special is that
it was their collaboration with makeup
Shayla where they launched mascaras as
well as her own city mini palette now we
have the eye shadow done I'm gonna go
ahead and complete a winged liner
because I feel like this look needed one
and then for lashes I'm taking Jasmine
Browns collaboration lashes with I'll or
and this is curly queen and it came out
with two latches you can find them at
Ulta and you better get them because
jasmine is my best friend
okay and now the eyes are done and are
looking really nice and pretty like
Sidney blacks eyes because her eyes are
amazing now I'm moving into the face I'm
going to go ahead and contour and I'm
using the itsmyrayeraye palettes do this
because it has contour shades and then
for blush I'm taking the Tarte and
makeup Shayla collaboration and this
blush is really nice in pink and soft
and it went perfectly with this look to
add a nice glow before highlight to the
skin I'm going to add my little lotion
from ELF and I'm applying this all over
my face because I want that
nice inner glow like NEMA tangs glow
because her skin is always glowing and
then for highlight we're gonna take miss
Jackie I know Jackie Jackie Jackie
Jackie her collaboration with artist
Couture and this is 'la peach and LePage
is 'la bomb it is love radiant it is I'm
getting annoying with the loves but this
is an amazing highlighting you have to
get it and then for lips we're gonna
take my collaboration gloss with elf
cosmetics this is nude rose and this was
definitely the highlight of my year
because I never thought I would get a
clap so thank you l for gave me my first
collab and an amazing one at that and
then I want to look nice and stylish
like Alyssa forever here on YouTube so
I'm gonna pop in my jacket and I would
do my hair so let's poppin like our nail
but I don't have hair so we are good to
go for this look
alrighty guys so here you have the
finished look and if you couldn't tell
like theme of the video it was just like
my way of showing support to my fellow
black beauty influencers who have had an
amazing year whether he would collapse
mission or just really killing in the
industry as I'm sure you guys know it is
a little more challenging for black
content creators in the beauty community
to get the same recognition as others so
I just think it's really important for
us to really support each other and I'm
gonna use my platform to do so and also
this is my way of saying you know like
I'm so proud of everyone for having a
really good year and this video is in no
way trying to you know like Shay anyone
that she's not like in my major I just
simply want to uplift my fellow black
content creators because it's important
to do so in my opinion so I hope you
guys liked it and honestly a trim that I
want to see next year is that I am
hoping that you know more of us are able
to get opportunities and grow and you
know just really kill it in the YouTube
community and just like as a whole you
know I really hope that we kill it next
year and I hope that I'm able to do a
full face using collabs cuz that would
be amazing but yeah I mean I just want
to do this video because I don't know
I've thought about it on my
yeah I think we had a pretty good year
so I'm just I'm very excited and just I
don't know I'm really yeah really
excited good to see what next year
brings I'm just I'm just hoping for like
a really really good year and I'm hoping
for just more diversity and everyone
winning and everyone getting amazing
opportunities and I just learned life's
want greatness for everyone I'm sure you
guys can tell like I'm just all like
let's just kill it
so hope you guys like this video if you
did be sure to give it a big thumbs up
and I'll see you guys in 2018 that is
crazy

freakin crazy and I hope you guys are
excited for the new year because I am by
