today's tutorial is going to be on this
makeup look right here and I love you
tell but SuperDuper vibrant and just
nice and just it's fun and I want to
start doing a little more fun colorful
tutorials actually have a lot planned
because busy summer and summer is fun
and vibrant and I just I want you to
feel that with me so and you guys are
saying that you want some more color so
here you have it hope you guys like the
look be sure to comment down below what
other colors you want to see me do other
than that nothing else to say be sure to
subscribe you haven't already and thank
you you're subscribed and let's get
started okay so I already have my eye
primed so the first shadow I'll be
taking is this nice yellow shade from
the Kat Von D me vida loca palette and I
want to use this as my background color
so that I just don't apply orange
because if I just do that it reflect and
for my orange today I'm using the NARS
Persia eyeshadow and I love this shadow
and I know that NARS eyeshadows are
pretty expensive but I've had this for
about two and a half years and it's
still so pigmented so I really
appreciate that in ours and as you can
see I'm creating almost like a winged
like shape with my eye shadow and I'm
also going to make sure to carry that
Orange over my hood so that the eye
shadow doesn't get lost and I'm also
going to place this shadow on my lid
I'm stuck go ahead and soften everything
up by the way all the brushes views will
be in the description bar below so don't
freak out
next I'm taking my MAC Cosmetics mixing
medium eyeliner and on top of that I'm
gonna apply pumpkin pie Biko drains one
of the new eyeshadows and it is amazing
they're amazing I'd swatch them on my
snapchat so I'll be sure to list my code
for them down below and then I want to
add some sparkle so I'm going to take
this arctic litter in the shade melon
and these aren't eyes safe and they did
not bother me whatsoever and it's
beautiful I mean look at it it's amazing
and then for lashes I'm taking huda
beauty lashes any style sascha which are
slowly becoming my favorites because
they're just so nice and perfect for
every look and now to work on my
waterline I'm taking color pops puppy
cream liner and it was very dry out to
be honest with you guys but I made it
work I tried my best and I'm just going
to smoke that out a bit with some NARS
Persia just to get it nice and orange
underneath there I want to be all nice
and orange and then to add more of a pop
I took coloured raine superstar and I
applied this right on the edge of my
wing as well as in my little inner
corner flappy folds and then these are
the eyes done and then for my face I did
my foundation concealer and everything
off-camera and this time it wasn't even
intentional it's because it kept messing
up I had to redo it five times and it's
because I forgot that I self tan the
night before so my foundation was not
matching my neck I was like what's going
on like this is my perfect shade and I
was like oh yeah I sub tan so I'm so
sorry about that you guys you know that
I'm always I'm pulling on my shade but
yeah today it was just like no but
anyway not to finish the look off I'm
gonna apply my lip color taking my
French - coffee lip pencil and then I
took this orange lipstick from Lime
Crime only orange I had on hand and then
this will be the finished look I really
hope you guys enjoyed it thank you so
much for watching and now it's slo-mo
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
