today's look is going to be this teal
look right here and I have just been
really feeling color and I'm kind of
just knocking out each color that I
possibly can and I'm really excited
about it because colors they just kind
of screams summer and teal it's so
summery spring so I'm really happy and
it's makes me happy so I hope it makes
me happy as well
so we are so close to 200,000 I
mentioned in my last video but I'm just
keep Mitch knit so you got my okay maybe
I could tell my cousin's friends sisters
aunties uncle to subscribe to our
channel so should get there faster and
we'll be all good other than that thank
you so much for being here subscribe you
have it already and let's just jump into
the satori oh okay so the first thing to
do is just draw a line or eyebrows gonna
be I'm not gonna fill it in yet yet but
I just want to fill a line there so I
can know where my shadow first next
we'll go ahead and cleaning it up
and then instead of taking my mac studio
finish concealer I'm actually take my
Maybelline age rewind concealer as my
face today and I really really do need
to find a better base because I noticed
that the studio finish doesn't work the
best when it comes to super bright
shadows so I definitely definitely
definitely need to figure something out
because I was struggling but I figure it
out and the Maybelline Asian line is
better and I'm gonna set that in place
with my Laura Mercier my first shadow
I'm taking mega peeks time travel and
it's really deep sort of short a sort of
teal shade I'm taking my zoeva 230 luxe
pencil brush and I'm gonna place this
directly into my crease I'm not gonna
fake a crease today I'm just gonna place
it right where my crease is because I'll
put a matte eyeshadow on the lid so
let's toll you okay now I'm taking
dragonfly by makeup geek and I'll place
that right on top
then I'm gonna take my zoeva to 31 petit
crease brush and I'm just going to
soften everything out of it just soften
everything up I'm gonna take makeup
geeks sure thing it's really late till
shade
now I'm going to leave that alone for a
bit I'm going to take my Mac laying low
paint packed and my raw and lathe and
concealer brush and I'm just going to
clean up the lid area
and I'm gonna place short things right
on top and then I decided I want some
shimmer so I'm taking makeup peeks
sparkler in the shade solstice but first
I'm gonna take a nice thin layer of mac
mixing medium liner and I'm just going
to play solstice all over my lid for
foundation take my Carmex natural finish
foundation obviously okay I took a whole
lot of dough god
for consume I'm gonna take my Maybelline
instant age rewind how this light shade
have food that's the one that was into
it being too light for me but we're
gonna we're gonna try this out I would
normally set in place with my Laura
Mercier I'm actually gonna take my
Maybelline shine-free powder because
since this concealer is pretty light or
lighter than I normally do the powders
got toning it down because it has a tint
to it and then set the rest of my face
that powder as well I'm gonna go ahead
and add some more powder just to catch
any fallout when I do my under eye let
me bottom half of my eye I'm taking
makeup geeks liner pencil in the shade
mint and I'm placing my waterline now
I'm gonna take dragon line and place it
directly underneath only smoking it out
just a little bit and I'm gonna take my
deepest shade that I put in the crease
area on a place it directly underneath
and I'm not gonna bring that down only
get place on the outer corner haven't
decided what laughs I want to pair with
this look yet so let's go ahead and
knock out the rest of my face I'm gonna
take my Too Faced dark chocolate Soleil
bronzer and this whole time I'm using my
royal and langnickel blush brush to do
everything
i take my morphe m-52 for brush from my
nose like always for blush I'm going to
take makeup geek summer fling blush I
feel like coral shades go perfectly with
teal let me do that for my highlight for
some I take Smashbox Hollywood late
mom's gotta take this small morphe in
won 7-2 brush just a place that I'm
gonna deflect me fools can I be taking
you champagne pop and just placing that
right on top it kind of rhymed then I
went ahead and applied some mascara to
the top of my lash and I was a put on
the bottom as well free lips I want to
you bits simple so I'm gonna go my gloss
from Marc Jacobs in the shade love-drunk
and then for lashes I want it a lash
with a big thin band because I didn't
want to cover my work so I took the
Christina lashes in the number five to
three and their stupid routine so here
is the finished look I really like how I
came out and I'm so happy it came out
