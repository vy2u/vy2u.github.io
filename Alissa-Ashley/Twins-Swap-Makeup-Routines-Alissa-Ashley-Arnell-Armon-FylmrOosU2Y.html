cast already okay so now we're gonna go
ahead and get Steve and what do you like
to do first one on your routine I do my
brows first well I like to do my full
face so you gotta do primer foundation
conceal their baking and then you touch
all off and then you're gonna move into
the brows and then the eyeshadow and
then the contour you loves you so much
you do your brows first fool I did not
oh that's where I said that
oh so Alyssa primer is this something
sounds expensive to me it's $200 it's in
France I've seen those expensive
double tees your immediate and long-term
instant long-term Cicely whatever that
is oh gosh okay so foundation we have
Tom Ford
haha you take longer we have this would
be a really stressful thing for me Tom
bowed and she also spin Tiant he makes
these to UM foundation oh you big
tanzanite

do your brows first you know like why
did you wake up one day and say I'm
losing my brows person my routine okay
to be honest I do my brows laughs but no
okay no no like I do my brows first and
these fix them yeah I fix them again
yeah yeah like I'll rest my brows first
then I like apartment that at the end
but um for the most part I'd do them
first because I'm really lazy and I hate
doing them til I'm getting them out of
the way somebody onto them last forever
we don't like doing it I just want to
rest but for the most part didn't first
I know I was like you know wait I hate
missed that time I'm telling you you do

your undertone at all
all right now like I just this
just unbelievable like a little flawless
this the best you've ever looked you're
like no lie to you I wouldn't lie to you

expensive stuff let's see what this just
talking about well actually no good just
no no sweetie that's for the full face
you'd use make it revolution about our
to set your highlighted areas
what's the Sephora how do you move
forward because everyone knows about the
microphone so I think I'm okay
you said everything or not everything
you set your under-eye and then around
your around your mouth with the banana
powder to do that first I cannot believe
she does not know about the microscope
powder you guys thought about to you
that I lost it Ilia coolies okay good
and then you see that brush will put in
there for you the more p38 you're gonna
take that supports microscope and you
get a buff it over your face look it
smells really good actually
that smells really caught it okay so
let's see you simpler we do not Arnel
uses this foundation I use different
color some more tan I'm not cheating but
I can't use this shape because it's not
my shape or maybe it's Thompson my shape
look it's not oh maybe it is oh okay
wait I'm not a knight I'm telling you
oh no this is to life and you look at
look at this I got a mix in my tha EKU's
use code blue mama for 10% off or
whatever wherever you get oh yes it is
it's my dark shade up like I don't know
to do what my friend Oh
we're go ahead and take this broad shade
say foundation but we just need we just
need to color this may be a little bit
too dark but I'm hoping that by just
putting little dots of it
oh it's not terrible okay okay already
well I haven't used a Korean broad thing
in so long that scares we're gonna see
how this turns out well you kind of you
know played me for a fool by giving me a
pencil so watch me good what's that
Barney is oh yeah she's magic powder
oh my god you get you know I am I'm in
the group now what my bro you better
make it work good job
how long does take a look at you Center
feet so fuck you
so this is fucking my eyes ah so yeah
that's in c-45 that's why your shade
that's good
you don't think so you look flawless
girl highlight time yeah
please this or this down for top though
the bottom okay oh wow
I literally look like myself like what I
do make up the way bigger come you see
the worse
oh wow little bit highlight my my
earring some board for lips use books no
no no wait I lined my lips first using
this that's pretty
what I use maxvill your the Mac one your
face plus I have that
I just need it oh yeah please I've been
using what I have I'm using extra using
my little DIY one you made this this
trust it
okay so we are done with our looks now
let's go ahead and critique okay
out of all my products which two were
your favorite the Tom Ford Foundation
okay and the highlight okay what are you
- your favorite I would say the gloss
and the blush actually because I first I
thought the bluffs that look like just a
mess but this is actually quite pretty I
would say it's quite pretty
now which two products they do not think
at all the brows wait why I don't like
do my brows with cream you're probably
really good though are now like they
finally match your hair could used to do
so light I think they look great yeah
it's it's doing your eyebrows
okay like turn right didn't you like to
see what didn't I like I do not like
this concealer because it is totally not
your tone whatsoever and we're gonna
work on that a little listen tomorrow I
do not lay there you go
you need to did this because this
literally as I was bluffing it it brings
out my texture what textures exactly
I'm a night attention abroad texture
that's a shame I'm in house no yeah I
was at the brow product that mean that
really wasn't a problem I'm just not
used to my brows with a pencil and it's
cool tone so that was pretty stressful
for me not gonna lie you know I'm kind
of like you know I mean grant ever look
good on camera the highlight is
beautiful you need to know this is
beautiful
not more so I mean yeah oh wow do you
like my stuff like my mom would
literally like Rob all those stuff I
could but she sure would do that
sure you were gonna get that Tom for
foundation cuz you guys heard on camera
that's just who you for me
get it to me but I mean overall would
you say that you would consider doing my
routine yeah no definitely I would turn
on rocks my no brows the stick let's
step by step would you do with no steps
oh no I would do my brows first I would
never treat my routine for the world
eyes like this I feel like when you do
brows first okay that's done that's at
the way when you do your brows in the
middle I can do your bait like you're on
a roll you're blending you do so clearly
right oh my god now go do my brows I
don't like that I mean I do sometimes
but I don't like I like do my brows
first it was a disaster for me but I'm
glad that our nail enjoyed it I'm glad
that you found some props and you're
gonna like I'm probably the middle
body's high like it is roto actually
