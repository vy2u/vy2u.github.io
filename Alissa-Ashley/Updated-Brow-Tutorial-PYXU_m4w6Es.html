good morning because I'm recording this
voice over in the morning but I really
want to get this video out for you guys
first I'm going to take my Kevin uh Quan
central skin enhancer this is a shade
number eight and I'm just going to
outline the bottom of my brow usually
people fill in their brows before apply
the concealer but I've been learning
that I like it better to apply the
concealer first and just get my shape
out the way as opposed to placing the
product not liking the shape and then
going over the product with concealer
because sometimes it just looks a little
sloppy next time I take my anastacio
number twelve brush and I'm just going
to start filling out the bottom that's
like to do second I have a broad
tutorial but that one's um a little
outdated because I don't do my brows
have taken him before and it was really
thick after they go through brow phases
samms outlining the bottom brow getting
it nice and straight and I'm going to
start pushing the product upwards and
into the brow before I apply any more
product to the brush and Dad mentioned
this is dark brown yes the dark brown on
the stasi Oh dip brow mimic little brow
in the front and right now I'm just
creating the standard brow shape and
then I'm going to take this little brush
and I'm just gonna blend out some of my
concealer I'm going to go back to the
insular towards the end you'll see and
I'll explain why I'm splitting it out
just a little bit
and if you want to keep your brows
simple like this you can but I like to
go back in and make them a little bit
more HD because that's just my thing or
mimic little brow hairs in the front
just glad I don't have mini to begin
with and then I'm going to go to the top
and create a more bold defying shape
because upper at the top wasn't has to
find and then we'll work on the tail of
the brow and make sure that that looks
very very defined as well again you
don't have to make it as defined it's
just my personal preference so yeah
so just working abroad magic here
creating trust issues as people say
let's not just excuse it's just just
talent just face it and I'm gonna take
that spoolie and you know just make sure
I don't have any little brow brow
bubbles you know those things like it's
probably just kind of piles in it just
looks darker on some ends and light on
other ends just make sure we don't have
any of that
these will nice even brown a little bit
of fade at the beginning and then apply
more concealer and the reason I do this
is because afterwards I kind of go in
with the full I look and I don't like
the whole quick brow stripe highlight
underneath that makes any sense I like
it till rate even so I'm just applying
concealer to brush it down and then you
know normally I would follow up with a
look so it all goes together I'm
splitting it out with the a cosmetics
brush just there concealer brush or any
fluffy brush would do just became a nice
nice even brow and even concealer area
and I'm going to set that all in place
with anasazi is clear brow gel very
gently because I don't want to wipe away
all of the hard work because if you go
too hard you can be losing some product
you don't want to do that and then you
have the finished well it looks pretty
and nice and neat I'm sure you guys
comparison see those money for brow my
after brow and I went ahead Dibble for
them and that is the finished brow I
hope you guys enjoyed this please let me
know what you guys would like to see
next and thank you so much for watching
and barring my little tired voice
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
