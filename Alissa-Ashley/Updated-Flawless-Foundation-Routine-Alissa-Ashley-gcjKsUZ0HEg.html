today's video is going to be updated
highlight contour slash foundation
routine it's because I've been using a
lots of new products lighting brushes
and powders and everything so I really
really want to keep you guys updated
because I've been loving it and I hope
you guys love it because it is the bomb
to me yeah don't forget to Like comment
and subscribe
that means the world to me and yeah
let's just get started so the first
thing I might do to get a perfect base
is cleanse my skin
I'm taking my purity one-step facial
cleanser and my vanity planet store
ultimate skin spa system brush and I'm
showing you guys the products which
means you guys go look for them you
can't find them and all the names of
them will be in the description bar as
well as the code that do have for this
skin care device so yeah I'm going to
rinse that off and then I'm gonna
moisturize with my M release late -
cream concentrate this is my favorite I
use in like every single video I use
every single day when I didn't use it my
makeup was a struggle
so next I'm gonna take the color FX
mattifying primer I like this one
because it is anti acne it fights your
acne and I do get occasional breakouts
in the areas I'm applying them so I'm
just going to apply that first and I'm
going to take this Kevin Kwan and
illuminator I'm going to call it because
that's kind of what it does and I'm just
going to place that on the perimeters
around my eyes just anywhere what I want
a nice glow in the next I'm going to
color correct with this la girl Pro
concealer in the shade orange and I'm
just going to place that on top of the
areas where I have a little bit of
darkness and pigmentation because that
helps with that and I'm going to take
this brush from the juvies place brush
set and I am going to blend out that
corrector these brushes are new in my
routine and they were sent to me for
review but I can honestly say that they
are
I don't want to cus amazing like
literally as I was filming this I
stopped Midway when I realized how
bombed they were and I emailed them like
these brushes are life like I was so
excited about them even my mom thought
made me she sounds on fleek and she
never says that selves ok ok Juvia ok
so I was very excited to share that with
you guys and then I'm going to take this
la girl Pro concealer and
is in the shade cool tan and I'm just
going to place on top of the color
corrector as well as any other area that
have little scars or even under my eyes
just because they're a little bit darker
just to get a nice base and I'm going to
blend that out with that brush and I'm
going to switch over with another brush
once I get to the larger areas on my
face
and then on to this flat top foundation
brush I am going to start dabbing in the
product I am NOT moving it around or
swirling around I am dabbing it because
I do not want that product to be you
know moving around because yeah they'll
defeat the whole purpose of me
correcting those areas basically is what
I'm trying to say that you see it's
pretty flawless and I'm going to take
the Make Up For Ever Ultra HD foundation
and I'm going to take that same brush
pump a little bit on it and then I'm
going to just blend that into my face
going in circular buffing motions
you
and then I'm going to take my honest
hasta concealer this is three point five
and I'm going to take this other Judy's
place brush this is a flat brush so this
is perfect for concealer and I'm going
to apply my concealer underneath my eye
as well as on my forehead
next I'm going to shake the other girl
Pro concealer in the shade beautiful
bronze this is something that I use like
every single look so you know the love
is real and I'm going to place that on
the areas where I'm going to be
contouring like always and I want to
take this blending sponge this is my
first time you all this is my second
time now my first time being introduced
to this company they included these
sponges and our makeup show bags and
yeah this sponge
definitely just replaced my Beauty
Blender I kid you not I will have of
course the name of it and everything in
description bar but I can't remember
heart because the brand is so new to me
and I'm going to take that buffing brush
and just blend everything out and I'm
going to keep switching off which is why
I'm speeding it up because who wants to
sit there and see me blend but yeah just
watch me go to work with these brushes
and then I'll be right back with you
guys okay
next I'm going to take this brush it's
like a traditional foundation brush
basically and I'm going to blend out
where I placed some la girl Pro
concealer in the shade cool tan my
camera didn't catch it but I did place
it underneath just to make my contour
look a little more defined so yeah I
placed under I blended it out and then I
kind of mix the two together a little
bit so I didn't get left with a harsh
line yeah because we don't want that and
then I'm going to take my pin eye banana
powder of course and I'm going to set my
highlight in place and also I will
mention that these sponge that I
mentioned earlier this is another one of
those and I have two of them because it
came in two pack I think it's very cool
because you know you can have one damp
one and one dry one so you don't have to
you know use your damp one for dry stuff
so I thought really cool see I'm just
going to set all my highlight areas in
place as well as underneath my contour
to give it some more definition because
we're all about that contour in the next
I'm going to take the new addition to my
squad which is the kett cosmetics
colorless compact powder and have that
one in the loose one and I'm going to
take this brush it is not a flap top it
has a little bit of a roundness to it
what I thought would be nice for setting
my powder I'm going to swirl it into the
cap powder and I'm going to dab it and
then I'm going to move it around just to
kind of buff it out
I want to dab it first because if I
moved around too much it would you know
move around my foundation because what
set yeah but yes this power is amazing
I'm going to do a review on it because
it is so amazing it has no flashback it
keeps you making in place all day and I
think you guys all need to know about it
but that's for another video and the
next I'm going to take my Too Faced dark
chocolate Soleil bronzer which is
clearly a favorite and my zoeva 109 face
paint brush and I am going to bronze up
my face you know pretty simple and
clearly this bronzer is my favorite
because I use in every video I have
tried other bronzers but they made me
look very great I'm just going to stick
with this one because it gives me a nice
you know contour at the same time it
adds some warmth so that's what I really
love about it
in the next I'm going to take the
smaller blending brush and I'm going to
use this to contour my nose and I like
this brush because it was fluffy enough
to make my nose contour nice and soft
and seamless by the same time you know
point enough to give me a nice defined
nose and there are very few brushes in
my collection that do that so I was glad
that this brush in this set did that for
me so very impressed
in the next I'm going to take the same
brush that I use for my cat Cosmetics
powder and I'm just going to sweep away
and kind of buff out my highlight and
then I'm going to be left with a nice
flawless soft smooth slayed highlight
which we all love and then I'm going to
just bronze up a little bit with the
same brush because I want to look a
little bit more warm because I love my
bronzer I love looking warm and then
lastly we are going to highlight using
the by brown bronze glow this was a
limited edition but I will list a
product recommendation that is similar
to this one down below because you know
don't want to make you guys feel sad and
I'm using the same brush that I use for
my nose contour just to get a nice
defined highlight and then I'm going to
place at the tip of my nose little wedge
between my eyebrows and then I'm going
to kind of slightly blend those together
so you know it's just not two separate
areas but I like doing that because it
makes my nose look more defined as
opposed to doing one stripe down the
nose and I'm going to take this last
brush and it's a flat kind of definer
brush and I'm going to use that to
highlight my Cupid's bow there are more
brushes in this set and I'll be sure to
show you guys on Instagram so don't
forget to check that out if you are
interested in purchasing them but after
that that is the finished look and as
you can see we're very very seamless and
nice and smooth you guys always ask me
you know what edit do you use you know
what software do you use and it's not a
softener I just you know I spend a lot
of time blending and I make sure
everything's nice and seamless and I use
products that work and another bomb so
you know hope you guys you know like my
recommendations and I hope you guys you
know go out and try these products for
yourself which ever one you know jumped
out to you but that is it for this video
thank you so much for watching and I'll
see you guys soon
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
