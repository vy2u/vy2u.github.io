it outside but I want to go inside
goofball to get a facial it's my first
facial so I felt like why not vlog my
experience and I'm gay message so I'm
gonna go inside and I'm gonna walk my
little experience if you guys won't come
with me than a kind of choice to watch
this video you can I think I'm pants if
you want to yes because it gives a
little warm under the sheets it's not
too fully naked it's up to me but you
can yes I may usually go in the world
okay go underneath okay okay all right
I'll be right back okay so I have to
just take off some clothes and my
necklace is how do I do it will he have
music
yes I just got the bra down okay oh I
didn't know this is such like an
intimate they're gonna be just fine I'm
gonna walk out of here looking glowing
so now I'm gonna be been doing facials
I've been doing this for about 11 years
now
oh wow yeah I started off at plastic
surgeon's office oh yeah and then this
is my second year being here on my own
okay I'm gonna put this team on you so I
have to it's gonna be me yes oh my gosh
you're super new huh like he's gonna see
steam coming out sometimes it smells a
little funky just because it's called
the ozone okay I will actually just help
kill bacteria I just you know any
situations going on so that just kind of
smells a little bit funky okay initially
and then you don't smell anything
who's my best angle you guys I know I
get this experience what's this so we're
gonna start cleansing this is just a
sponge with water initially I just wipe
everything
oh this this is a call to free cleanser
you're so cute oh wow
you've been missing out girl
the newbie you so are but it's so cute
you're a virgin
so how often are people able to get
facials
you know once a month depending like if
I have a lot of company clients so a lot
of them come and you want them in there
re weeks but mostly it's once a month
so what I'm doing is just kind of
massaging this and to loosen up any dead
skin just get things a little bit going
stimulate a little bit oh this is a
cleanser does it feel weird because I'm
good okay
who knew that just getting stuff under
your face right there smells good
peppermint you are a little bit on the
dry side zone
do you feel like you get dry a little
bit cold like this whether she still
tries I don't let it so much then
changes its my top lip like how much
those are now you get close your whole
bit you do
there's a map that I want to just put on
your book okay is that okay I just put
on the face nice out of you it's just
cuz the lights gonna get really bright
so I kinda dig near your eyes so you're
not like point blind if I want to do
extractions on you which means I'm gonna
clean you know little congestion
by the way this blonde hair is so nice
on you suits you really okay swear to
keep your eyes closed you're gonna feel
like it's going in your eye but I
promise you
feels weird are you doing okay
so weird
I don't like oh Lord oh but it's okay
you Louie that was so good
but I see it Oh show the camera it's
creepy but the copper complex this is
how you can apply it to just you know
why you no sign of the cheeks the
forehead the chin and then you just rub
it in
it's also good yes that blueberry
chicken
I like to do is hydrate in the morning
treat at night now we're done so I'm
gonna step up take your turn whenever
you're ready just open that door and
I'll come back in okay all right
sweetheart
that felt amazing
I don't want to move I just wanna stay
here I like facials I was always scared
of them coming okay like I don't ruin my
skin you know cuz I'm stuck could be
like really harsh but I feel great I
mean I guess I'll talk to you guys I
leave here but well well oh no it's the
same Wow okay look at my skin you guys
is it glowing I'm trying you guys see
that don't lie I mean so you don't I'm
into my mouth I'm sorry but that was
such a great experience
oops it just felt like a treat to me and
just you know like I highly recommend
just getting a facial or even like if
you don't need a facial do something
that like just requires you to do
nothing and just lay and be pampered has
such a great experience and I'm so
excited I'm excited to do the monthly I
think that'd be great for me because
like I've been trying to do more for me
lately so I'm excited and I'm happy my
skin's literally glowing so yeah my
first big spatial facial experience went
awesome and I'm very happy so hope you
