well first long time no see
I know I think I like we gonna have
first it turned into almost like a
little bit of a phrase because I was
killed uninspired and then on that
little break I got sick with prolonged
it and then I had to get my teeth done
so it's the logical answer call now I
really happy and you guys know notice my
teachers right now and fearful that we
are talking as to pronunciate more so I
guess the good thing because now I'm
forced to pronunciate and slow down a
bit
plus is so different and these are even
the permanent ones these are temporary
so the permanent one grows better and
yeah but today's video is going to be a
Valentine's Day makeup tutorial and yes
that's it John has named a tutorial
because you doesn't want anyone
and also it's a bit of an update on day
two routine because I'm using all news
products for my face for the most part
and I want three guys so you guys want
to see that and just keep on watching
and what you guys like you
okay so the first thing that I'm going
to do is climb Aniston ours radiance
primer it's pretty bomb it's really
hydrating any like it and on Instagram
live which is so fun by the way I just
Sarah lighting blinding word and it's
really fun but a lot of people asking me
asking me as they ask I talk to that by
the things the wrong way asking me
what's a good primer and I like it a lot
it's very hydrating and SPF it is a lot
of you guys have been wondering what
foundation I am wearing or just reading
lately I have been using the maker
forever
sticks the Ultra HD and they are amazing
and I'm going to shade why four four
five and why 505 I just put the lighter
shade almost my face and I think the
darker shade I put it mainly on the
perimeter and I kind of mix it in
basically I'm not too light to a dark
age of makes them
which is like my scenario for most our
nation's Wow I did all this I don't have
these by the prepares against in studies
and media and I'm gonna take this morphe
in for 39 and just left it in it doesn't
really matter what you use
I think that it just the finish of it is
nice to either wait but I like to be you
wonder what is okay okay what my search
I look really greasing right now but
that's okay with me because my simply
dry so I kind of want to look this way
so that I ran look this way the dry
anyways now for my tape shaped concealer
a lot of you guys want to know what
shade I am and I was using pan at first
and then I went to Ulta they have more
shades there so I got kin-san because it
looks more yellow tone that's more me so
I need this now and I stocked up on it
too because they never have enough stock
I know a losses in putting a lot and
that's because I am okay and I'm going
to take this part of you to entertain
and it's actually really good
like I never thought that I would buy
the sponge that is like better than the
blender and it was actually really soft
I like it a lot
and then to contour I'm going to take
these shape rich not even see this the
first time I got my shape didn't have
these dark entities in store I really
like it because it's like the perfect
combination of warm and cool tones so I
think it's great for the contour Toby
simply this is a Sephora 47 brush
lightly kind of blend out and I'm the
golden money later let's not be like you
disrespectin in my corner there on day
the Tarte blender pounce on that a
little bit for setting powder to take
the perfect setting powder I cover that
pretty ba man it's so good like I got my
hands in the finally because kept
beating like pulled out on Sephora and I
thought it was doing nice and I would
prepare it to you where to
I think that it's better then more might
be a little bit because more applying
new let me sense I'm learning that
especially to start out of line and work
my way to the inside because by then I
already have powder on this fund and
sometimes whenever I'll start on the by
the nose area I'll mess up the
foundation it's so hard to explain but I
like going out and then work my way in
and it works out for me
and I'm telling you guys this sponge is
so soft its soft in the B blender so I
actually like it a whole lot more active
on other woods I like it a whole lot
more than the musical in front of the
eye because it's so soft and just you
know it sounds is really nicely so I
start I'm not getting at cake you'll
finish if anything is nothing miss food
is the goal around mouth area a little
bit
call my face I'm going to take my
wonderful Sephora micro-sim powder and
this is number 40 tan and I'm going to
take my e - for us by morphe and i'm
going to go ahead and set the rest my
base this is really my holy grail of
face setting powder and then I'm going
to take this morphe 53 I liked it
because it's like I'm like tapered and
it fits right on the eye and the tick of
Micra smooth and hums lifts up under it
because like I mentioned the color X
doesn't have that yellow tint so
sometimes you can kind of leave it a
little bit more white than usual or that
I prefer so I'm supposed to go over it
more detailed with the mikaelsons -
totally down now for my brows you guys I
keep doing you guys back and gone I put
my like Instagram Instagram fan you guys
have been love my brows lately up
Instagram live and mountain I'm Krishna

been using the BH Cosmetics Studio Pro
waterproof brow pomade in the shaper
dead picks the bomb
I love it and I'm using this brow Gow
brow brush lose my favorite by the way
playing brush these brows I'm a filament
actually left it open overnight so kind
of try but it's still good it's still
the bomb
okay so I see I would hand you one last
camera because I didn't know well doing
soon as I want to make sure I knew I was
going to do and I'm going to go ahead
and do the other eye now the first prime
that the Urban Decay's primer potion is
eaten oh god that's your trouble is my
face new oh come on
okay he'll worry what the hell and later
dude rip sup to my face maybe close old
no no and I'm gonna go ahead and take my
morphe 27 and just slim this in and then
for this look is so simple tastes like
three eyeshadows and one little glitter
I'm gonna use the Anasazi a modern
Renaissance palette and I'm taking the
shade and we stick it up click on my
chest I'm taking the shade Venetian red
go ahead and take this morphe in 5 3 4
go ahead and kind of put some into block
palm out go ahead and just pack that
into the inner corner and I only really
want some inner corner I mean internet
your outer corner and I'm taking burnt
orange
I'm so Jesus is softening it and I'm
going to pack it all in to make it more
intense but you want to take softer
shapes to make everything nice and soft
and blended
and then taking me morphe 36 and take
the Venetian red again and just pop that
on the outer corner on the lower lash
line a waterline whatever this is
right I can never really know and then
this is so beautiful just by sila it is
they're magnificent metals glittering
glow liquid eyeshadow this is a rose
gold retro and I'm not going to apply
directly with the wah I'm going to take
come on the back of my hand because
easier to have control over it and I'm
gonna take just more feet in 41 and I'm
gonna pack it onto my lid you want to
mix a little bit on your hand too
because sometimes I mean I know it's
kind of liquidity so make sure you're
getting really nice little tape glitter
part of it and not liquid and then again
and then you want to make sure I'd like
on your hand you're scooping it up
because you want to people is really
nice big chunky glitter particles
because it's really gonna Sparkle and
I'm going to go ahead and pop it on the
lower part my eyes love oh okay I got a
bunch of my eyes you do not want to do
that glue it in the eyes no bueno
and then playfully eyeshadows done
because yes
click simple that's it now I'm going to
mascara for a mascara I'm taking the
jewel Eclipse matters and I sound
excited because my favorite mascara
right now and I'm going to really make
sure to come transfer right there oh my
god okay like I'll say I'm going to make
sure to take my time and make sure each
lash and mine is separated as much as
possible
and then for lashes a lot of you guys
want to know what lessons I was wearing
will that resonate and they are the
salon perfect go glam a multipack and
you get a one prepare to bow impact and
the number 6:15 they are amazing I
absolutely love them because it's like
they get kind of at the natural feel was
out there my laughs I'm like okay but I
select this very lightweight I need to
take them out of pack I got mine from
Walmart by the way they're very
affordable
now the cons from go ahead take my NARS
contour blush this Gina listen more PE
for put you over to my in five to four
for the nose
and therefore bless and ignis narcissus
for this is unfiltered one now I'm
taking a mixture of this one and this
one and this one just create some
perfect rosy cheek okay I had a little
bit too much so go ahead and take a
little bit of trans with the power just
dust over it might make more of you
brush much better and therefore
highlight I'm taking my peach glow it's
the baked
gelato for illuminator by Laura Geller
and this is the morphe 51 take that and
just place it on my high points
highlighted areas I think I like the
peach because it's more subtle why
