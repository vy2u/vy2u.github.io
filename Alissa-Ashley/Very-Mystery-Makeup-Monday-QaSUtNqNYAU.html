welcome back to misty where my different
welcome back to mister you make a Monday
you guys our favorite thing on my
channel I love the fact that you guys oh
yeah yeah I want to say that I'm so
happy that you guys like this series of
mine I think that's like amazing because
when I originally came up with it some
people that I kind of like pitched it to
with the hey what do you think of this
thought it was kind of corny and you
know I was a little bit discouraged
about doing it I was like you know
Alyssa like you can with this little
cool concept and just push through and
do it and see how they liked it and you
guys end up liking it so much and it
actually gets the most views on my
channel so I just want to thank you guys
for liking it so much and I mean even
though obviously when you come with a
super cool concept other content
creators want to go and snatch it
Christopher Columbus it so far no one's
really done that so I mean I'm thankful
for that as well because that just means
that I mean it's some decent amount of
respect to going on community and it's
allowing people to just have their own
careers concepts and not always taking
it because you guys know that everything
on you to the recycled but yeah I can
ramble all day I can just return to a
rant video I just want to go ahead and
thank you guys so much for liking this
on my channel because it means a lot to
me do you want to say that but today you
just doing lawn or context we are upping
up the mystery we are busting it up and
you can see on our wheel right here your
I like Alyssa are your life so bright
that you cannot see the word no I mean
they are but like that's something that
you can ask you the words you cannot see
it because maybe we use invisible ink
today and even mile creek I can't see it
I can't see I don't know what any of
these things are and I'm there you just
place them randomly on the board we're
going to spin and we're going to take
this invisible ink pin because it's a
lie on it oh my god rub the batteries
has a light on it and we're going to see
what it decides why my so dramatic yeah
in that so cool like
that's cool and oh god is falling and
falling ah dude my life are kind of
bright so I do have my little extra
camera and I'm gonna have to like hold
it as I reveal the freaking name because
yeah my legs are too bright for business
you guys let me see it don't make it as
cool but we're going to go ahead and
spin and today I'm going to spin for
four colors and we're going to create on
the create magic for glows you know
we're going to create cool so let's go
ahead and spin now going on
alrighty so let's switch the camera to
now I'll do the reveal let's do it huh
oh yeah we have green oh the green is on
the green so we have green our first
colors Oh
Monday's just love green don't they
okay so you have green green again you
guys so amazing gun-slinging all right I
see this is all righty so we have black
all right what the heck I'm gonna cream
green black the black is our second
color now I'm going to go ahead and
spinny in
for our next color we have cream cream
for the off-white kind of color
what are we going to do with black
greenie cream
my parents kind of everyone take one
more color and let's see what we get
okay I can't really tell if this is the
same color ever let's find out see this
is in color oh okay
I forgot to mention before we started
that I added two little post-its on here
that says I pick and you pick so the
lands on I pick that means that I get to
choose the color to add to my look any
color that I want and if it lands on you
pick that means that I'll go to either
snapchat or Twitter probably snapchat
because that probably more better
because a lot of you guys follow me on
there and I'll post the random snaps
saying pick a color and whenever whoever
snatched me first and pick the color I
open it and that's the color I actually
use for look so I decide that I want to
do that just to include you guys a
little more in it so now we have cream
black green and I pick so let's go ahead
and switch up our set up a little bit so
I can get more I'm close and let's do do
all righty so I went and brought you
guys in closer and often speaking I have
no idea
one two three I do not know I mean I'm
happy I get to choose an additional
color to help me out of this but I mean
green black and cream said what can you
agree with that I mean I'm sure you can
create you just want something so I
think that I will let's see I think of
like my brush here I'm trying to make
because the other color adds has to be
like mine I take color I can't take
multiple colors since I'm a brush I
think that the color I'm going to choose
as my I take color is brown
I'm inches brown I'm going to take this
brown here from the vibe art talent this
happen else advice on and actually don't
dumb take this from this Brown right
here we're going to place it in the
crease area
all right can look back Yolo can look
back yeah I think I think I have a look
I think I do the choice to looks a good
choice to go brown it's not too dark not
too light so go ahead and take some
shape tape is a tape shape JP I said it
right okay shape dude concealer and I'm
it carve out the crease area I think
yeah
and then go ahead and pick this cap on
being me view loca palette and I'm just
taking the cream I so inside just pack
it right on top I'm going to go ahead
and add a winged liner I'm gonna go
ahead and take up on that guy's shadow
and we're going to put this on the outer
corner are we I think so yeah
I think little nervous I'm gonna leave
in school we're gonna do it kind of
carving it out a bit
this is a more feet in one to four brush
and the other brushes I use from dose of
colors it's like a breast of a fit to me
and meiosis I really did it I liked it
that's tight right looks tight I'm
trying to get wearable because I feel
like another looks a wearable and like I
want to make you guys proud and make
something really wearable we're going to
take a little bit of this morphe slate
gel liner and we're going to take that
same brush we took earlier and bring it
in a bit and I want to be more intense
right here
I'm gonna go ahead and take some mascara
just coat my lashes so I look crazy
without it I'm going in with a different
liner because the other one kind of got
more matte and I want this to kind of
pop more this is a Physicians Formula
one and then for lashes I want to go
three nice and fluffy in slithery and
these actually sent to me by Method
youtuber just remove the shade here on
YouTube intern with our lash line and
these are fire I'm like okay slow let's
go ahead and put these those alrighty
let's go into this bottom - I gotta
incorporate our green okay so for the
base for green I'm going to take this
Sephora this is their matte pencil it's
waterproof it is in the shade
staying alive I mean ah just stayed
alive and it's more of a teal green but
I think that by placing this first and
then doing our agree on top it'll pop
more I'm so doing hm
and I'm going to go ahead and take if
more be m12 for not staying alive stuck
in my head and I'm gonna take this from
the movies maybe their milk that maybe
to look a ballot and it's going to save
misfit and I'm going to pop this
underneath just to bring out more the
green
