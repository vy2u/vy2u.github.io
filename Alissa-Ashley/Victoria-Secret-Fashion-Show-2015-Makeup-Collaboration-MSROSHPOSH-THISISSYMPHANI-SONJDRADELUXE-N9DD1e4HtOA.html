based on this intro I'm pretty sure you
guys can get a clue on what kind of
video this is me Symphony Sandra and Raj
all teamed up together to create a
collaboration video showcasing our
recreations of the Victoria's Secret
Fashion Show makeup at the Angels war so
be sure to check their videos out once
you are finished watching mine the first
thing I'm going to do is pry my skin
with the Marc Jacobs perfecting primer I
want to use a nice hydrating primer to
act as a base for my 24 karat gold
facial mask by gold glam Beauty this is
my second time using this mask and I'm
using it because the Angels have such
radiant skin and I feel like this mask
the first time I used it it just gave me
this nice radiant glow from within it's
so hard to describe the feeling you get
once you massage into your skin and
you'll see in just a second after I'm
done applying it a lot of you guys are
very intrigued when I wore this mask on
my Instagram and you want to know if
those worth the money in my opinion I
would definitely say that it is worth
the money it'll be a great gift for
someone that you know you want to make
them feel like a celebrity or someone
super important awesome because
celebrities do use these facials however
when they use the facials they cost
seven hundred to a thousand dollars
because it's at an actual spa so I think
it's pretty cool that you get to
experience luxury at home and I like
that because I like going anywhere and I
like touching my own face I don't trust
anyone on my face so yeah I think it's a
really good purchase and I will have a
coat for you guys to use you know just
to knock that price down just a little
bit because I know it's a little bit
high now on to foundation
I took my Maybelline fit me foundation
this is the dewy plus smooth one after
the doing one because I want my skin to
look nice and dewy and then I'm gonna
move on to my bare minerals bare skin
concealer I have been falling in love
with this concealer lately I have four
of them so far all them are different
colors I don't even care they are just
amazing and they just blend so
beautifully into the skin and yeah I
just like it's the perfect you know
balance between lightweight and creamy
so I'm quite impressed and only $20 so
that's pretty cool now I'm taking the
Ruby kisses 3d face creator and I took
this because I like its consistency I
feel like it blends really well into the
skin so it will look like I'm a little
bit contoured but not overly contoured
it won't be too harsh and I know that
the Victoria's Secret
you know angels don't contour you know
they're all nice and chiseled
I'm not chiseled I'm like a little
chunky burritos so I'm gonna contour I
can't be an angel without rosy cheeks so
now I'm gonna take my smashbox la lights
lip plus cheek stick pencil thingy that
it is I don't know what they call it but
it will be instruction bar and I'm just
going to place that on my cheeks as well
as a little bit on my nose because I
watched videos of the actual artist
behind the scenes of the show and he put
the cheek cream on their cheeks and nose
okay I guess I have to do what he's
doing now I'm taking my Maybelline set
plus smooth powder because it's a very
very lightweight powder and I just want
something that will still allow my skin
to look like skin and it's just a nice
smooth powder so I was like I'm gonna
pick you up today now I'm taking my Too
Faced dark chocolate Soleil bronzer not
putting too much just bronzing up a
little bit and I'm gonna take Sigma's
cheeky blush I end up placing more blush
on my cheeks towards the end so you'll
see that towards the end like I just
said I'm such a weirdo and I'm taking
benefit Watts up cream highlight I knows
that the Angels don't really have
highlight on it seem like they're just
radiant from within like how house way
so instead of doing something super
chunky I took my Laura Mercier face
illuminator because it's much more
smooth and all pretty and soft okay so
now we're going to step away from the
face and do the eyes and a lot of you
guys loved my eye brows and I love them
too because I did them much different
than I normally do I tried to make them
look much more natural and for my brows
I'm using the benefit browsing in the
shade dark I absolutely
lovely browsing because it comes with a
pomade type texture thing and it comes
with a powder as well so as you can see
I'm just creating little brow strokes or
brow hair strokes with my zoeva winged
liner brush and I am just going to
almost create the shade that I would
normally create but just make it look a
little bit more rough and natural and
I'm gonna take the it cosmetics bye bye
pour concealer because it is one that is
similar to my skin tone and I'm going to
take this paint brush to clean that up
so the brows are very very easy to
achieve you just have to create little
mini brow hair strokes if you guys want
a more in-depth tutorial on how I create
these brows let me know and I shall do
it for the eyes I'm gonna speed through
it a little bit because it's just so
easy all I'm gonna do is take this color
pop eyeshadow and this one is get lucky
it's a nice gold shade and I'm going to
take my Too Faced dark chocolate Soleil
bronzer and I'm just going to lightly
enhance my eyes by making the outer part
look a little bit more open and that's
why I'm taking that bronzer there and
then I took a deeper brown eyeshadow
this one is from make a peak it's called
hot chocolate and I'm just going to make
sure that it's nice and blended
I'm almost trying to create a shadow to
make it look like my eyes have a little
bit more depth and texture because of
the fact that they're so small and just
tiny and hooded so I'm just really
trying to enhance the outer part of the
eye to finish off the eyes I'm just
gonna take some NARS audacious mascara
and apply it on my top and bottom lashes
and I'm gonna apply some lash singles on
the top just to make my eyes look a
little bit more big and these ones are
firm Ruby kisses I believe or kiss New
York give those breaths confused but it
will be in the description bar below now
for the lips to achieve that nice pink
pout I'm going to take on estancia's lip
gloss in the shade metallic groves this
was a part of the holiday set and I just
like it was the perfect shade for this
look and now like I mentioned earlier I
went ahead and pack some more blush on
because I feel like the Angels have nice
rosy cheeks and I really really want to
embody that because I just like it's
such a pretty look and after that the
look will be complete
it and I really really enjoyed this look
I just felt like it was so beautiful
because it's just natural enhancement
and it's just nice and soft and you guys
loved it on my Instagram as well to help
you guys equally love the video so that
is it for this video hope you guys
enjoyed it please make sure our check
out everyone else's videos below they
will be linked in my description bar and
I will see you guys soon
