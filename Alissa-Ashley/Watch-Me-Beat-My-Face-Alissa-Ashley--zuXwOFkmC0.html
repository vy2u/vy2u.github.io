for today's video I decided to put
together this really I don't know I'm
gonna call it yet I just I don't know I
like it so we're running with it and I
want to give you guys the video because
I know that when I dropped the photos
you guys are your videos so I'm just
like okay let's do it but I don't know
how to call the look yet
but this video is in partnership with
NARS they are sponsoring this video and
I'm going to be using NARS products but
yeah that's about it my rambling if you
guys want to see this look then just go
ahead and keep on watching I hope you
guys enjoy the video okay starting out
the bear baby face I'm gonna take the
new natural radiant long wear foundation
and this comes in 33 shades it is 16
hour wear transfer and sweat resistant
and it is also full coverage I'm most
impressed by the shade range because
they got it right the first time and I'm
so on board with that and I also really
love the finish of the foundation
because it gives me a really nice full
coverage on my skin it still looks and
feels like skin in this war very well
throughout the day next I'm gonna go
ahead and conceal using the radiant
creamy concealer and this concealer and
I we go way back this is one of my
favorite concealers if you have been
watching me I use this so freaking much
it's like one of the best best
concealers ever and I'm gonna use it to
highlight to my face and then I'm gonna
go ahead and set that in place with some
good old banana powder because I am a
yellow little thing and I like to be
nice and golden and banana powder does
it for me and then I go ahead and buff
my Sephora micro smooth powder that I
use in every single video all over my
face just give me that nice airbrushed
look and just a set the rest of my face
I decided to do my brows off camera and
I'm gonna go ahead and do one eye
off-camera as well and I'm gonna use the
new narcissus wanted palette and this
palette includes 12 shadows with four
finishes and it's their new pure pigment
formula and here is what the palette
looks like and I'm gonna start this look
by applying shadow Hill which is a
really nice matte and as you can see is
the perfect soft transition shade
and I'm just gonna flush this over the
entire eye and then afterwards I'm gonna
take the shade Lala which is a Shimla
shade but it's a very subtle shimmer
nothing too glittery and this is a
shimmery deep bronze and I'm taking
temptress which is described as a
saddened paprika and this shade is
definitely one of my favorites in the
palette because it's very soft but still
bold enough to get that nice kind of MA
the cranberry look that we're getting
right now and I'm gonna go ahead and
repeat the same steps on the bottom part
of my eye and I do this a lot just to be
very cohesive and make sure that
everything flows nicely to it next I'm
gonna go ahead and apply my mascara I do
apply lashes but I skip that part
because the lashing you see me wearing
in the next clip I end up canceling them
and I'm gonna pawn different lashes I'm
gonna go ahead and do my little contour
thizzle to get these cheekbones snatched
and I'm gonna apply this blush this is
Taj majal blush and I love love love Taj
Mahal to me this blush is amazing
because it just it would look good on so
many different skin tones in my opinion
especially deeper complexions so
definitely check it out next I'm going
to do my lip using the power matte lip
pigments and done it again and walk this
way and this is actually my first time
using these lip pigments these are only
two I own and that will not be for long
because I'm going to frickin get more
these are so good I'm trying to
emphasize this these are so good they
lasted so long they're so smooth I was
shook I was like wow in this color
combination I was just so here for it I
was like okay okay anyways now I'm gonna
go ahead and pop in a little bit of
brown liner into the waterline just to
make the eyes pop a little bit more you
know getting a little bit more boldness
without adding any shadow to smoke it
out I just want a little bit of bold and
I'm gonna go ahead and highlight my nose
because she just needed a little bit of
a button nose because it was looking a
little bit flat and then for the final
step I just wanted to add a little more
radiance to the cheeks so I'm adding a
cream blush on top to really set it off
and then here you have the finished look
I really love how turned out I love
the products I hope you guys liked the
look as well if you happen to recreate
it be sure to tag me and let me know
your thoughts down below other than that
and you guys so much for watching my
videos and I'll see you guys in my next
one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
