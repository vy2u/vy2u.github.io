night because like 9:30 at night is kind
of random I just I don't know I feel
like I don't like my hair anymore I just
and I go through this at least like once
a year I just I don't know I just I just
just I keep saying it I don't feel like
myself I feel like my most happy style
my blonde short hair so I'm just gonna
go ahead and just do it and I decided
you know why not get a kick out of
frickin filming me being impulsive and
just shave my hair off I guess I'll just
show you guys my process belong where
I'm at it because a lot we want to know
how I've choose my blonde so I'll just
show you guys everything so I'm just I
take this comb oh god I check out my
other brush I'm trying to find my other
brush but I mean it's okay I basically
just want to brush out my hair because
I'm about to freakin cut it but it hurts
because like a lot yell at it yeah I
don't know I feel like after I dye my
hair brown I just kind of lost interest
in it and I just want a fresh start so
my hair looks crazy like this next one's
kind of cool huh got straightened
because of all the jello having it
soaked on just naturally strains okay
that's hella Joe Jesus how much gel do I
need oh my god okay so this is step one
crazy now the Clippers I have are pretty
cool they're from wall designer and you
get this one I got the pink edition from
salads it comes down little thing and
everything it's legit and it also comes
with a tiny it's called the peanut so I
got from Sally's if you're interested
I'll link it down below I don't know if
you care but I'll show you got that
anyway I guess I'm just gonna go ahead
and start the shop
mr. on guard number two
okay that's not doing shit so I guess we
gotta take this off and go to the lower
one
you
still do anything that's
all right click myself again man
this is awesome
Oh God
I'm not a professional barber so it
probably will come out the best but
that's okay
I'm so happy like I'm really happy trade
out way to me it's just tickling my
titties right Oh tickle the Dedes wait
ha ha I can't do is allow
I feel whole stay cold okay so now after
I kind you let the first layer I just
kind of see what else I have to do I
kind of like this little length okay
this part here it's too long this whole
little part here is too long so maybe
okay so now I'm going to go ahead and
just kind of comb it to the opposite
direction yeah I kind of like this
length what do you guys think
no I want a shorter I do I know I do
so in fact grow back in a week or so so
whatever
okay so I mean in the past basically
every time I've done this I fucked up
but you know what
why not I'm gonna go in with no guard so
we just go ahead and just kind of strain
my hair a bit you know get it in the
pattern that I'm gonna cut it so I won't
mess up with other times and let's just
hope for the best that we've heard
so I think that I'm good
this is like the limp I want it's very
low I know it looks kind of uneven but
that's like someone that's Jill okay so
don't freak out over this okay it's
totally fine but I feel so happy now
honestly a lot who asked me you know
like why is it so easy for me to do this
it it's because okay I guess it'd take
us like a little hair story just as like
a little middle part of this video
before I get into bleaching when I was
about 15 I'll be fool like during that
kind of stage I was always dyeing my
hair and one day I was kind of like
dyeing it it I just completely fried it
my oh my face I just completely fried my
hair and I was very just frustrated so I
just started to kind of chop it in our
nail you know she was so dramatic like
the last so what are you doing oh my god
you know she just freaked the hell out
and I would just cut in it and I was
listen to some very emo song I was like
I don't over here anymore
and my mom was like what the hell are
you doing and I didn't know what to do
so we actually called over my neighbor
because you know he was a guy he was
like in his 20s all guys the Twins have
Clippers so he end up cutting my hair
for me I dyed it brown and I was just
like okay and I was bald like I was like
this so I just kind of felt really
confident in that moment in that moment
I realized ELISA you don't really need
hair you know just feel confident and I
think that even in that moment it's like
some people were very judgmental towards
it even my dad let me I was an asshole
because he would always pick at me
because you know I think that people are
more accepting that short hair is shit
now but back then it's like people would
always associate short hair of being a
lesbian I don't know why that she's very
ignorant in my opinion because it's like
what is your hair doing sexuality that's
just me
I just don't know in that moment it's
like I'm just like realizing okay like
some people don't let the short hair
some people are associated with this I
didn't care you know I just was feeling
very liberated and I just felt so cool
you
like not yeah just not cool you know and
it's like even just now sometimes a
comment saying oh please guard your hair
you'll be so much more of a woman you be
so if we're beautiful and I just don't
see it that way I think that I'm
beautiful because I possess good
qualities in myself and that makes it
beautiful I don't think that hair is
what is the definition of beauty so I
don't take it as seriously as a lot of
other people do so whenever I feel like
it I just cut it off because I know that
to come back to me it's not something
that many attached you like oh my god I
need hair but no it always come back you
know like so that's just my whole
philosophy on things but sorry to
Congress interrupts I know you guys here
for the bleaching so I started to talk a
little bit and say that these kind of
things are not like I'm not gonna cry
about it Michael Vick oh my god I miss
my hair I know I feel so happy whenever
I do this that's why I do it like twice
a year so yeah let me go grab my
bleaching stuff and let me show you how
I bleach my hair as well just like my
favorite products for bleaching right
now okay so for my blond they're still
hair of my face my blonde I actually
found this at Sally's because I was just
tired of buying the same things I just
want to see is there anything better out
there for me oh that rhymed okay I like
to use the brought broad Jesus it's
called blonde brilliance and it's by who
the buyers it just caught bronze what is
this oh this one looks like okay
I'll link it down below it's called
blonde brilliance and this is their
Express nine level powder Lightner
extra-strength and this is their a 35
volume developer and I have a couple of
developers and I'm going to be using all
blonde brilliant stuff today it's not
sponsored whatsoever I went to Sally's
emojis okay and I also have this mixing
bowl in this little brush thingy okay so
with this I kind of just eyeball it
um oops this is brand new is I've opened
actually before eyeball it but with my
mixture from my bleach I kind of just
eyeball it
and just try to get a nice creamy
consistency with it so does I have less
hair I don't have to use as much bleach
so I'm gonna put about that much in
too much okay maybe I need a little bit
more just a little bit more and I love
this bleach it doesn't like burn or
anything like some of other bleaches
I've used in the past and I'm going to
take my developer just kind of eyeball
it mix the two together until I get the
consistency that I want I'm not a
beautician I did not go to beauty school
but I just kind of simply don't
necessarily trust anyone else in my hair
so I would rather make mistakes on it
but I've been dying my hair blonde so
long that I kind of got it down so yeah
all right now I'm getting some comments
like I went to beauty school you're
doing it wrong okay so it is nice and
creamy so I'm just go ahead and apply it
to my head I don't know where my mirror
went so I'm going to use this little
NARS mirror to help me because I don't
know what the hell it went I lied to you
normally I just kind of use my freaking
hands I just slap it on but for the sake
of looking professional I'm going to use
a little brush
okay so now I have to wait for this to
light into the level I want to lighten
make sure you get all of your edges
because there's been times where I've
like had a little brown stuff it looks
so silly so yeah I'm just gonna sit here
and I'm Oh see look I even get a whole
part it's you guys fought because I
usually don't mess it I just had messed
up oh I'm in wait for this development
I'll be back okay so I'm gonna see okay
so I went ahead and washed off the
bleach I kept it in for a good like 20
minutes I'm gonna take this blonde
brilliance it's their perfect blonde
ammonia free toner this is champagne I
usually get the Platinum one but I
wanted to try champagne because it seems
more just like a blonde blonde so I'm
gonna go ahead and use this so platinum
because sometimes the platinum is a
little bit too cool tone for me I'm also
going to take the 15 volume developer
not the 35 that's really high so I'm so
go ahead mix the parts that it says on
the bottle I'm gonna go ahead and apply
this toner to my head I got a new set of
loves and honestly what the toners
doesn't work so fast
I literally just like slap it into my
head I don't have time for the brush I
just slap it into my head
and then with the toner I don't really
put a time on it I just monitor to see
how it's toning and then I rinse it out
we go ahead and do that okay so as you
can see I have makeup on and that's
because like I don't know what this kind
of hair you kind of have to slay so I
decided to go to sleep last night after
washing up that toner and I woke up and
then I did my makeup and yeah I don't
know I just I feel the most confident
with this hairstyle I just I really
think it enhances my features I feel
great the world likes it because I get
the most stares and comments what about
I just think that overall this is me so
I'm thinking I'm going to stick with
this like I'm always going through hair
whatever you want to call them but I
like this and I just feel very happy I
feel very mean so yeah that is it for
this very random video it wasn't by any
means and tutorial I just kind of want
to share the experience with you guys
I'm just shaving off on my hair because
I always do it and I never get to record
it but I thought it would be fun so yeah
hope you guys liked it I don't know and
I will talk to you guys later I guess
yeah peace out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
