explain this video is three outfits for
New Year's Eve I kind of tried to stay
with him the sequined trend just because
I know that everyone's gonna be wearing
sequin and I wanted like a different
kind of look so um always more that you
can dub out things for the things that I
put my videos for the things that you
already have in your closet I use
Jeffrey Campbell ITA's as my shoes and
all the outfits just because that's what
I had downstairs and I didn't bring a
lot of my black shoes home so I just use
those but I'll just put in what you have
and it'll look just as good or it
probably better because the leaders
didn't really go with everything but I
just I had them downstairs
so however it has a great New Year's and
is safe and has a great time and I'll
see you I'll be uploading my get ready
with me New Year's Eve edition probably
January 1st so I guess I'll see you in
2013
bye hope you enjoy
um</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
