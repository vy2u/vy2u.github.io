today was one of those days we're gonna
feel like feel like we know make up so I
just didn't and I'm filming this in true
for you songs make up what you gonna do
about it
today's video is in collaboration with
our X bar and I'm very excited about it
because they're a great protein bar
company I have the sample pack here what
I like about them is they just have all
the ingredients listed on the front and
then on the back like any other protein
bar I have all the ingredients but the
only difference is I can look at them
and I can read and understand and
pronounce all of the ingredients that
are in this bar I'm obsessed with that
I'm gonna be a fan of protein bars for a
long time I'm one of those people that
will sacrifice something in order to be
on time and a lot of that time a lot of
time back to eating so I'm gonna kind of
protein bars nice I don't make fan of
protein bars I think they're great for
on-the-go I hope this would be the
perfect video to collaborate with our X
bar because you guys have been asking
for healthy snacks and what I like to
snack on during the day so this is it I
do have a coupon code listed in the down
bar so check that out if you want to
produce some more X bars but other than
that let's just get right into the video
so for the first snack I'm gonna do a
superfood jam on whole grain toast this
is really easy make your own jam at home
just require berries lemon chia seeds
and honey and you just cook it up you
can blend it up and put on toast and I
love it so delicious and sweet second
healthy snack is an Rx bar and these are
healthy protein bars I love them there's
no BS ingredients it says it right on
the package there's three egg whites two
dates and six almonds as the core
ingredients they taste really good
there's no added sugar they're gluten
free soy free dairy free which I'm into
my favorite flavor is the mixed berry
flavor and you can go to our x-bar comm
slash Alegre and use the code Alegre to
get 25% off your first order
the third healthy snack is already
prepared foods that I get at Whole Foods
my personal favorites are the no meat
spicy buffalo bites and the hazelnut
patties filled with protein vegan so
delicious
snack number four is cauliflower buffalo
bites there are ton of different ways to
make these and they're ten different
recipes online I just made them a really
simple way just on top of the stove you
can also throw them in the oven and
that's some spicy vegan Mayo and I love
these great snack you know so just make
them and heat them up for later one of
my all-time favorites and I've made this
basic my whole life because it's just so
damn easy you could make it on top of
the stove you could make it in the
microwave but I just edamame beans you
freeze you have them in the freezer and
then you just heat them up basically and
throw some sea salt on them and they're
just really delicious and nutritious for
you leave a comment on what you love to
snack on other than that thank you so
much for watching peace and love love
you all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
