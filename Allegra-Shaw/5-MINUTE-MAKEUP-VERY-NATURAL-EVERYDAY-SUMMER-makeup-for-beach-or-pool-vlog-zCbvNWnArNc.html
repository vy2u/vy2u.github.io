my purse today just lay down and I
lipstick once I can go got too much
debris okay my purse is wrapped on my
arm all right it's for sure you're
foolin
all right here we go
I get it
okay
Oh
I'm saying after what I want to take
excellent
okay all their crazy bricks then I just
took off my makeup and I'm going to put
on a manuka honey mask literally just
manuka honey on my face but I'm having I
just had dinner kind of having a sugar
cravings I this is not sponsored they
just sent me this they want they asked I
want to try it
this is called crave crush and it says
this will stop one sugar craving so says
dissolve one crave crush on your tongue
immediately following meals snacks to
take daily as needed don't exceed 12 a
day so it's just like zinc and some leaf
extract
I like how much sugar craving right now
so and I literally just ate so I'm going
to do it I'm gonna do it let you know if
it works I'm also watching the Bob story
right now watching the hometown dates
Dean's hometown dates crazy okay so it's
just this little white thing feel like
I'm taking Molly statistic a mint but
all you know how it goes
my honey face mask on but still
dissolving it online tongue and I want
to show you I want to tell you how it
works so says as it dissolves in your
tongue crave crush binds to sweet taste
receptors suppresses sweet taste and
helps reduce sugar cravings in seconds
honestly I like I don't really feel like
I want op sugar anymore I was thinking
like I want to have like chocolate
something sweet I really feel like that
anymore
is it a placebo effect I don't know if
it doesn't matter hmm pretty impressed I
want to do right now is like drink water
so if you have crazy sugar cravings ah
how I suggest you at least check this
out try for yourself see if it works for
you because worked for me I'm gonna have
some water okay it's the last day of
July at the cottage but what I wanted to
do is since I'm a little bit burnt
and film some makeup the perfect summer
makeup it's like super lightweight no
makeup I just had a shower so I'm going
to just do that right now okay
not the ideal setup but we'll work with
it fine okay so a lot of these products
will actually almost all of them are
glossier I got a package in the mail and
then very happy with what I got I spent
a lot of money but so obviously after
you wash your face you can use some
moisturizer I use the bio through aqua
plum I'm actually out of it
what kind of sucks moisturize so I am a
little burnt I kind of sucked up
yesterday and didn't even SPF so what
I've been really liking for neutralizing
any redness I'm also this is my mirror
right now so I'm going to be looking
over here a lot I've been I got the dr.
jart tiger grass color correcting
treatment well it's a thing like this
I'll link it down below but it's just
basically this like green thing has SPF
30 in it and it basically just corrects
a new redness I do find it washes you
out a little bit so if you're super tan
I might not work as well as if you were
pale but I like it for putting under
makeup
I just got it all over sweater okay
oopsies so my whole face is on a red
let's get even the whole thing out and
you can also if you like to look at this
on your skin just use this as like your
face like your foundation like you
wouldn't need to a foundation on top or
anything or like that which I've seen
people do looks very nice but I am a
little more tan than this tends to color
correct too but it's all bad and because
the glossy products are so lightweight I
like this to really cancel the redness
because that also doesn't do the best
job with canceling out the redness next
I'm taking a glossy skin tint and this
isn't dark so I think that their color
collection isn't very good because I
shouldn't really be dark so I either put
on my finger or put it directly to my
face but this is really just like the
skin tint it's not doesn't have any
coverage really kind of evens you out
but I would not say that this has any
coverage like the most lightweight cover
you can build it up a little bit but
it's still like nothing and you're like
well why didn't put it on your face but
it kind of just like evens it out and
then I have the Glossop a concealer you
don't want to buy glossy or you can't
get access to glossy a be milk makeup
sunshine skin tint is very similar I do
like this one better it's less orange so
I'm taking the concealer and I go I got
second tailor in medium and again it's a
very lightweight concealer perfect for
this no makeup look and I just usually
finger because I think it blends in
really nicely and I'm guessing this
medium color would be the color of the
skin tint if you got medium I have no
idea if this is blended oh so alright
let me check on slim in kind of and if I
feel like I hear any coverage like I'll
put a update like a more intense
concealer on but I don't need that for
right now I also don't feel like I need
to set this under-eye concealer so
that's nice is so light kind of just
sinks into your skin and that's that's
it so the next thing I use is the glossy
a cloud paint in desks this is a pretty
dark color for me and I can use it as a
bronzer so what I do is I just take a
bit on my ring finger do dark that is
for me I feel like this smell would be a
really nice blush if you or a darker
skin tone I think it'd just be one of
those like it'd be like tart exposed for
a darker skin tone I think that'd be
really nice but for me you can use this
bronzer just blending it out and
everything should be really natural not
precise right because you really this
makeup look like it's supposed to make
you look like you're not wearing any
makeup okay when you guys tell me that I
didn't blend out this concealer I think
this looks nice okay done with that and
you could set that with a powder if you
wanted to but I'm really more for that
all natural dewy look and then for blush
even pops both beautiful colors more of
a coral V color and
this is more of a paint color I like the
pink color in the summer I think it
makes you look placed by a little bit of
a toasty tan although I don't feel like
I need the toast you can look right now
because I am toasted and super pigmented
lightweight like I use things are just
amazing I really really love the cloud
paints I think they really killed it on
the formula and the colors ah and then
because it is such a natural makeup look
you don't really want to like a glittery
highlight on so I really been liking the
NYX dose of goo which is just like a
nice sheen I just put it down my nose
the normal highlight places eyebrows but
it's really just a super natural color
or not color you know what I mean and
then what I do which is kind of weird is
I take a Kleenex and they just Pat it
down and so much access comes off and I
really just want it to sink into the
skin so I really like this step I feel
like nothing sitting on the skin then I
just finish it off with the glossy rose
bomb.com Universal skin valve they have
a ton of fruit flavors and colors and
whatever but it's very natural mmm
there's off some all men are setting
spray purely because I like the feeling
of a sudden Clary super super natural no
makeup makeup this is like perfect for a
pool party or a beach day and like that
here's the SPF under your skin so you
have the SPF and then you also have the
coverage from to come in a little closer
how natural this looks I'm very obsessed
so thank you because you now ship to
Canada and I always amazing products
okay we actually have to leave now cuz
we're getting out of here but thank you
guys so much for watching this video
