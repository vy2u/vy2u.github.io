which is crazy I want to see this
Valentine's Day lookbook up for you guys
as you can see the back of my apartments
like not done at all I have no furniture
you can tell by the echo this lookbook I
am featuring v watches I've been a fan
of v for a while and they sent me this
beautiful black watch it's all black the
face is black and the hands are silver
or like a dark like chrome and it's a
matte black band and I'm honest it sucks
that I wear it every single day um so
then they offered to send me watch I was
like a duh so I am featuring this in the
video I just want to give you some info
into what v watches are so all styles of
v watches are available at 12 a.m.
AEE st time on the 5th of every month -
VIP members as well as individuals on v
v waitlist so v watches are only
available for 5 days or while stock last
s' so if they sell out in two days so be
it can't get into the next month so if
you want one of these watches be sure to
sign up as a VIP member for exclusive
giveaways and competitions and
information on the products a lot of
products sell out in one to two days so
you definitely want to sign up to be a
VIP member if you want to get your hands
on one of these bad boys there are free
shipping and returns worldwide which is
epic so I think that's really great
because I hate buy something online and
being slammed with shipping up check out
they'll be a $10 off coupon code in the
description so check that out if you're
interested other than that let's get
into the Valentine's Day lookbook bye
enjoy I work
I thought I would do a voiceover
lookbook because I don't know if I have
done one of these before so this outfit
is perfect for brunch or day date or
something and I am wearing a coat from
forever 21 a shirt from hm the belt is
from boohoo and pre-sleep the jeans are
the castings those that's in a ritzy a
brand and then the shoes are Steve
Madden I am touched this outfit
it also looks great with black pants as
well and black shoes if you want to do
something more like that
I think this outfit is so cute but it is
not warm enough in Toronto to wear this
to the jeans again are the castings
jeans the shirt is from American Apparel
it's really cute and the shoes are from
Windsor store and I just think so it's
really simply just throw a jacket on top
if you wanted and I am obsessed with it
so if it's perfect for dinner or
something the footage is a little blurry
but I want to show you anyway so the
pants are from all stains they're waxy
black pant the shoes are Aldo the jacket
is Zara
and that crop is also AllSaints its
Opeth's screams valentine's day is so
sexy the dress is boohoo and the shoes I
will link down below
this is most likely what I'll be wearing
a Valentine's Day
this is a brandy melville sweater
Abercrombie sweatpants and that is it
just a great night in outfit putz super
comfy
