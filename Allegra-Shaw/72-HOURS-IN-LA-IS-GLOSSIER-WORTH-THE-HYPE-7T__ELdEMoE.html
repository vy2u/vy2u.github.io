tacos vegan tacos are these vegan it's

worked hard I think that the rest of the
girls went to like Alfred's T or
whatever alfred's room and then I fell
for its tea house and I went to max

like pop-up thing and I met Joey there
we looked at that and then we kind of

[Laughter]
just go back to the room it's a pretty
fun day I'm gonna go hang by the pool
for like an hour before we are getting
her hair done very tired spend a lot of
activities and I think that if you're
like an introverted person like me as I
said my last video you know like being
on all the time it was pretty exhausting
so working through it definitely like
take me on my comfort zone which is cool
but I need to go hang out and be by
myself
we're getting your hair done
I don't know what I want to do should be
a like a dream
my hair lay I really don't know how to
work those cameras
welcome to another episode of the light
of the ledger straw
today's episode we're talking about hair
and sunglasses okay looks like neon so
we're going to Chateau Marmont for
dinner
I'm wearing this just a vintage t
leather skirt heels it'll be on my
Instagram most likely and then on my
lips I'm wearing glossy zip with glossy
is clear gloss it doesn't look as neon
in person as it does on camera it's like
red not pink but it's going to pink
hi breakfast and Joey spills glass
everywhere from the plant and now we're
trying to put it back in so
we're in Malibu beautiful
girls are putting their stuff I'm like
such a mess
trip I've just been such a disaster but
this is
like
really California's
we're gonna serve can be interesting
do you like my wetsuit
feel very Blue Crush
I look good I don't have to talk John
you can just talk her me what said I
don't have to talk jobs later we arrived
at the Instagram offices we're gonna
meet actually don't know who are meeting
either really guys don't you like how I
always I'm really done up when I do
YouTube videos
bring that out of public do you want us
to get all good I feel like you would
 watch
like to 6 a.m. brought the airport
very tired
girls checking in
you know it's crazy they have to pay to
check your bags now raise your hand if
you're ever flying and you do not have
to pay to check a bag
$21.00 like
oh my god oh my god you have to see this
I am wearing those jeans that ripped one
second
I like my sis jeans that ripped and they
just ripped even more Jesus Christ I
don't have any jeans now like that our
jean color okay I just got back from my
trip of glossier to LA and they feel
like I have enough stuff now in the
glossier in my glossy collection to do a
full brand review because I feel like I
basically have everything first thing
when I start it was this is the skin
tint I have it in medium and dark right
now I am the dark shade I think that's
pretty nuts I feel like it should not be
called dark I've said this before cuz
like there's no universe should I be
dark they do have a wide range of shades
so it's just like the name of it is
shouldn't all be dark
I feel like medium will also be great
for the wintertime so medium and darker
and colors this has absolutely no
coverage you're wearing on my face right
now it just like gives your face a nice
like sheen and kind of even though your
skin tone a little bit cuz you a little
bit of color you know it's just like a
skin skin tint that's what it is the
concealers I get in medium I have them
in medium it really let this concealer
doesn't really like crease for me
anything but I really only like it for
under the eyes it's a very oily
concealer should have oily skin highly
do not recommend but under the eyes of
have drier eyes this is really really
nice gives that nice sheer coverage
that's easily buildable but just really
easily builds a ball is this concealer I
like to put on my eyelids and it just
kind of takes away any redness so I just
really love that the product that I
hadn't tried before is there louder
pretty impressed with this stuff so one
of the powders it makes me look very
cakey and I don't like them
what this does like this little brush is
really cute too it kind of just makes it
instead of looking super like Gracie or
anything just kind of gives these skin
tint more like a dewy finish and I
really like that I can put this over my
eyes and it's no big deal
doesn't crease but I just feel like it's
one of those really easy powders you can
put in your purse and the little brush
is really great for that as well so they
don't have a bronzer kind ups about that
I think a lot of people are upset about
that like the glossy bronzer I think it
like a liquid bronzer kind of thing
would be amazing they have boy brows so
everyone is obsessed with boy brow and I
don't fill in my eyebrows ever so what
they have is they have a clear one and
they have a non clear one so I have to
use the clear one and I really like the
way it makes my brows kind of like I can
kind of feather them up so I'm gonna try
the boy brow with some tint to it right
now I've never tried it before us so
like everyone raves about it I just
think I feel like I'm not someone who
can give you a good opinion because I
never do my eyebrows so anytime I put an
eyebrow product on I'm like oh okay but
it's not super harsh it's very natural
which I do appreciate for us ladies with
already thick brows feel like sometimes
things can look a little harsh but yeah
it looks nice good color but I really
about the person too and then there
Claude paints are like my favorite my
favorites are bean and puff which are
the pink and the orange ones so oh
that's right Beamen puffer my favor I
like both and equally just depending on
what look you're going for and then they
also have trying to find out right now
dusk and they don't since the bossiness
have a bronzer I like to use dusk as a
bronzer I've said this in a previous
video and you can apply with your
fingers or the brush I just don't think
I have any brushes right now so I'm
gonna do my fingers so what I do is I
just kind of DAB where I want it to go
and it does have like a pretty warm it's
a it's cool tone but it's also like it
had that kind of like pink flush to it I
find it's just like a really simple
natural kind of thing for me you may not
like the color of it because it is
actually tended to be a blush but that's
cool I don't care for me it works but if
I didn't have a bronzer I would put this
on top brushes a bit of bronzer on them
so
so I like that I like just having the
option be able to use I wanted as a
blush or bronzer I definitely use puffs
more than a used beam although I do
really love beam and this stuff I'm
telling you you need like none or it
like it's so so so pigmented and glossy
is very affordable which is nice and you
get like a ton of product that was like
less than a little pump you know I also
want to talk about the air bomb calm so
I have the Rose one that's what I've
been using and I really really like but
they actually gave me a bunch of other
ones so the birthday foam calm smells
like milk our birthday truffles whatever
they're cold comes like that I just took
way too much out there mint ones really
good use I just like trying them this
one smells like actual cake so I usually
just put them on my lips although you
can put them on your eyes to give me a
back glossy effect if you'd like glossy
a effect highlighter and I have it in
quartz and this is a really nice
highlighter but it's a very natural
highlighter so it's just something that
like I would put on the daily I feel
like glossy a really gets me and how
much makeup I like to put on during the
day would I ever use these products at
night I haven't used the blushes at
night and stuff but it's definitely more
of a daytime look and it's definitely
like a certain type of look you know but
the highlights are really nice
my least favorite out of the bond coms I
have them all here my least favorite is
the cherry one but that's purely because
I don't like the smell of cherry but
this one actually is tinted if you
wanted like a nice tint
it's nice but I would rather just like
not let this smell on my face so then I
have all the lip stuff I have all the
lipsticks and really happy they gave
these to me because it's not something I
would normally buy I'm missing - missing
one right now which is zip which is the
one that I wore in that Instagram right
here and then I put the clear gloss on
top and those are the things that I
understand right now
mmm oh my god they taste amazing that
bomb calms the lipsticks are really nice
they're kind of just like an easy to
wear lipstick um this color I'm putting
right now is cake they're just no fuss
fuss kind of like smears or you can just
kind of put them on and get some color
to your face or to your lips and I
really like that I'll just swatch them
quickly for you this is Jam that's cake
leo then this is crush the lip gloss is
like a classic lip gloss it's really
nice hide that like juicy sort of shine
to your lips the colors if I really like
obviously worried about instrument one I
wore so that kind of sums up the lip
colors milk jelly cleanser conditioning
face wash is really really nice the
packaging is beautiful
it doesn't like heavily take off your
makeup but I would definitely suggest
like take off your eye makeup before you
use this but I really like the
consistency I put this actually on dry
skin and rinse it I'll just take how I
like to wash my face I just have been
really liking this like the pump I like
that I just like everything about it and
just break me out doesn't strip my skin
my skin doesn't feel tight or anything
after so really really love that product
and their newest product which I got my
hands on before anyone else
well my anyone else but like before a
lot of people is the body hero bye bye
boss yay oh okay so this actually comes
at the pump it's just in the other room
right now I haven't used this specific
one yet but let me tell you I've heard
amazing people like I haven't used it
all over my body but I tested it so
basically it's like a shower oil smells
like
Garos kind of rosy but also kind of like
old-school sunscreen like in not in like
a bad way basically you do is you just
put it all over your body and it gives
that like thanks hydration and
everything and then you rinse it off in
the showers with like almost like a body
wash for like more like a conditioner
for your skin I would say all of that
and then this is the moisturizer combs I
think it comes with it or it and rochev
you buy them separately or they come
together but this is just a nice glowy
hydrated cream they still make it
Suntory today I was using it but I think
this is a great cream filling at night
out when you want to get that super nice
pretty glow so I really like I I'm
looking right now it's just like it
gives you this like amazing natural glow
with no sparkle because like I cannot
stand how they sparkle all over my body
so that's it for my glossy brand review
