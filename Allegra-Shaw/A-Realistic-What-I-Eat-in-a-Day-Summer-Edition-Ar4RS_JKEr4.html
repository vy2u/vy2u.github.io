like my favorite favorite snack also if
you guys are interested in seeing my
recipe for my walk I make a very basic
walk no tomatoes just avocados and just
the amounts in stuff I put in let me
know and I'll just make a blog post on
it really easy quickly before I go I
just want to talk to you about this
little program this presses new red bag
program which is available in every
everywhere in Canada except BC and
Quebec but what it basically is is you
know about Nespresso capsules are made
out of aluminum and are recyclable so
this little red bag you can get at with
every Nespresso Club order or they're
available at the Nespresso like
boutiques stores as well and all I have
to do is throw your capsules in here and
then drop it in to a Canada Post mailbox
and Canada Post will ship it back to
Nespresso for you and they can recycle
them super easy and simple I love that
dress is making just easier ways to
recycle it's really great and it gives
you the whole how the process works on
the bag they have a prepaid thing on it
you just fill out your name and your
address and then you take this little
sticker off so you have the tracking
there you go
I actually decided I'm going to walk to
the post office to do this
change into something a little nicer it
might actually untuck the back of this I
get it's summer but I don't know today's
like a weird day it's like warm but very
humid use that crazy amount of mess in
the background but I got some parcels I
just want to show you before I leave

funniest interaction with someone I was
like stuck in the middle of intersection
driving like where I'm driving you know
just stuck in another section poking
this down she was like like I love your
videos I'm like oh I probably look
really pissed off oh no but hi to the
person who I just met flowers in the
middle of intersection not exaggerating
when I'm saying it was like the
apocalypse downtown coming home it was
crazy
oh my god and I didn't have any form of
payment on me to pay for parking so I
had to pay in quarters I have like
change in my car that I didn't give to
homeless people like I always have like
a big thing of change I had to use all
to change paper parkings I couldn't get
out of the parking lot I have these
little zit patches on my face so if you
see those that's what I have on my face
testing them I don't see if they work I
took a whole my makeup sort of I just
used to wipe like how things like
biodegradable wipes now I'm gonna make
dinner I call home way later than I
thought I was gonna work out then do
dinner I think gonna do dinner and then
do an at-home workout now it's about
7:00 o'clock some dirty I don't know um
but since I did have a glass of wine um
I'm gonna keep drinking water that's I
always like counteract my wine with
water so that I don't feel like shit
it's time to make dinner there's
something on my screen it looks like
totally on my face as most of you know I
use a meal delivery service just
something that works for me I've used
one for almost a year now I'll on it off
you can like skip weeks I think it's
really cool um you can like skip weeks
and stuff so right now I'm using
hellofresh so right now for dinner I'm
gonna do the peach Joey and I are taking
a night off tonight
and that just means that we're not
having a sleepover we do that because if
we don't do that we end up sleeping at
each other's houses every night and then
getting annoyed with each other because
we spend so much time together mmm
because we work together as well so just
how our relationship works we take
nights off I'm gonna make dinner I'm
gonna watch The Bachelorette because I
get to have a little girls night
probably gonna do a face mask later and
you know be greasy this is what dinners
supposed to look like let's see what my
dinner ends up looking like okay I'm
wearing something different because I
feel bad I actually feel guilty my
friend came down with his three-legged
dog and I just went down to say hi to it
okay so dinner I'm having dinner now
pretty good I mean this obviously looks
better but pretty good I have some
leftovers for tomorrow some rice there
so I'm gonna eat this while I finish the
Bachelorette I never know when chicken
is cooked could get salmonella I'm
really weird about chicken probably goes
for eating raw chicken so it's just
really like chicken zucchini
rice and onion there's some cilantro in
the rice check in with you guys after
I'm done this meal this is for real like
how did this even happen I just dropped
it just dropped it when you try to
adults
I actually really lost track of the time
like everything was just a bit later
than I thought so it's actually like
10:00 10:30 now I'm gonna wait for this
food to digest a little bit and then I
might do an at-home workout I did
workout yesterday I think so not too
concerned if I don't get a workout in
today and then it'll work out tomorrow
um just cuz it is so late and working
out like really close to bed just I just
can't sleep after it so we'll see see
how I feel in a bit like half an hour
but the last thing that I have during
the day and make sure that I hit about
two 2.5 liters of water a day I track on
my water usually but I also just had a
liter water bottle too so it's too crazy
I usually drink a tea these teas are the
ones I've been loving I love the yogi
combing tea and the yogi stomach use tea
I just like love these seasoned things
they taste so good I honestly feel like
this one actually makes me
and I actually like this one helps my
stomach probably weed oh wow libido is
your sex drive that's all I am meeting
today that was a very realistic what I
eat in a day actually like I think I
like tell me if you like the vlogs I
really just like seeing the meals I
think I'm like walk along as you can see
like how like how active I was like what
I did you know like I probably if I had
done that what I eaten today normally
like I wouldn't have included that glass
of wine because like I don't usually
have that every day but you know today I
did and I just kind of went with the
flow
