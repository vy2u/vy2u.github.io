another haul for you don't judge me I
hadn't done a haul in so long and I did
one and then now I love to shop again so
first I'm going to start off let me just
test it at this coffee mmm
I'm so sad I got a grande starbucks
drink coffee and I want the Easter cups
give me one fruit oh wait so where's on
the drop with this box cool new audio
motika I found
principales all over YouTube probably
seen it many times - somebody go through
those and they're just so cute oh so
excited it feels like spring and summer
and festival season very excited if you
want order who princess Polly there is a
coupon code electrography 20% off and
they also have free shipping over $70
some US dollars so that's great that's
like commenting off and everything that
I show you will be linked down below as
per usual the first thing is like
totally I haven't tried on any of these
things yet but I've actually worn these
like a ton of times these are this key
you to the ring link their tee
sunglasses and these are just like the
largest sunglasses ever and I love them
because they're great for when you're
hungover and or not wear makeup I like
to wear them with like my like gray long
coat like a sweatshirt like really
casual many Saudis it looks super chic
so love that the next thing is this
distressed t-shirt dress and it is
called trying to make pink I don't know
what it's called agarn extra small which
is like gray color has a rip right here
it's like really lightly distressed and
being really good for summer to just
throw all the things just like a cotton
t-shirt dresses show
it's really cute next thing I'm pretty
excited about for summer it's this Toby
Hart ginger a little Lighthouse play
suit and it's why it's like this
, Tyrael it is it's like really it's a
cashier but it's just really pretty
think it's really nice with them like
just sneakers throwing it off the beach
I'm pretty into it not really my style
like normally my style but I think it's
a really nice in summary all this is a
trial also you're like looking at how
things that look on the body the next
thing is this big western-style belt
appreciate for it is silver another one
but it was like gold and I more like
silver person so this was just really
nice as like jeans and just like a
statement belt and actually really nice
like super Western it has that skull
size thing nice and then I hope you fit
I got these refuge which a lot of leg
high waisted pants there's black dress
I'm in size eight and they're like
really stretchy like almost like a
legging and they'll a cup in the front
and then they're skinny all the way down
and really hope these fit because they
think they look so cool like this was
just different detail to a black pants
it pops from the box they're not like a
legging material and I just really like
them I think they're gonna be like a
really great going out pants you know
everything's just super formal on the
website so you love that this tea or
it's a cropped what is this across long
sleeve but it has like all these the
asymmetrical sort of details like right
here on the neck and then the bottom is
it is like kind of see that like it
looks like that and it's like more of a
hot you know maybe cotton but it's like
a small calm took a cotton blend but it
just look more like a fantasy material
so it's like more sheet than just like a
cotton crop top you know but this is by
indica very large kay
I think this will look really cute on a
house it broke the box I really like
this I feel like it's very neat this is
from the brand NTSB and it's like a
white just slip dress but the bottom is
like crate so it kind of is it's just
like a different edge it's a little more
just like sheep not sheep pull a little
just different than like a slip dress
and I hope this looks really good
so I think we're really nice in summer
as well and today is the first day of
spring so like a perfect day to do the
whole elevado be nice and then I got
this is like super festival a vessel
season is literally just around the
corner and it's almost really cool like
Osheaga I love this print very festival
and it's like as long you're going to
see it on my body it's just as long
dress and it is like almost like a wrap
dress how does these like little short
sleeves and it's kind of go fire the
front of Loretha bot I think is really
cool like black boots quante body chains
that sort of thing it has like a really
cute festival outfit and I thought of
Paris my loss is not sure if I like
these ones as much as the other ones but
they're going to have their splack
aviators they're just like crazy there's
just a little bit large on my face like
I kind of feel like a cop or something
but I like them they're cool life time
just like dry you-sun losses by tea as
well and then last thing that I got is
this bond ice and Australian tan because
in ultra dark because I have tried to
repent if I have tried letting tan but
never turns on ice and I honestly didn't
know where to get it it's like I'm in
Toronto so in order to get it so I saw
this website like gotta get it going to
try it out they could be heard really
good things up on a chance - yeah so
that's the purpose of poly so make you
think for summer again my promo code is
Allegra and everything will be linked
down below so make sure to check them
out the next thing I want to show you is
actually what I'm wearing right now
so it's just this uncle bright-orange
crewneck and I have been loving this
college this color I just think it's
going to be really big for spring and
summer
it's like safety orange and suppose it's
objection on the instagrams it has been
released so you can check it out if you
want it there's only a few so if you do
want it I would pick it up now because
we didn't make that many we want to see
how many of you guys would actually like
this but I wore this with it next time
I'm going to show you looks really good
with like a light wash jeans I actually
have been on uncle Instagram on the
story I've been posting inspiration like
fashion inspiration with items that are
very similar to ours so like maybe some
high-end items so like I've seen these
in high-end stores but this is like more
affordable you mean select inspo so if
you guys get you inspired and give you
more outfit ideas for like what we make
and I'm to be doing that and I'm just
like I really love this color it's like
just so cool and has like of the logo
some raindrops drop top he'll be really
cute and then I was wearing it with
these bad boys from Topshop they have
them in red too but I thought I would
start with the black let me tell you
though the genies and like I love the
genies but since the material is that
that vinyl material they're not super
comfortable and they don't make your
bottom look that nice because it kind of
flattens it out but they look really
good from the front you can wear like a
sweatshirt like a long coat I just
recommend wearing from all devices your
bum is look like a flat pancake sort of
thing but I just love these are so chic
and just like oh this material I'm
telling you this vinyl material I'm
going to be huge for spring I just love
this and I think I don't know I also
know how much these were but I got them
from Topshop so I got a pair of jeans to
talk about season it IV they go home
talk shop with a straight jeans but I
can clean as I try them on the light
wash ones in talk shop and they look
really
so I've often black and then they didn't
look that good so I'm gonna return them
but I do like a straight concept they're
really like high-waisted which I like I
got this hat from big it up here in
Toronto but it's just a bricks and a hat
I think these tops are going to be
really in for spring as well like this
it's really like it was only 40 dollars
and I just really like it I think it's
just like super sheet you know something
different over those wiper top something
and then the next band I bought from Ted
Baker and is a pricier item but I had a
wedding to go to and I bought this
beautiful sea star to show you but it's
just like a beautiful jumpsuit and
jumpsuits are so flattering like I only
going to pet ever tribal on my Toronto
like a ton they're so flattering make
you look so tall and lean and slim but
this was a Ted Baker one you literally
can't see it but head like a Collard and
then I weren't open with like a fancy
bra on your knees who looks so good has
a belt little panties textured material
it's like oh it's beautiful it's like
stunning on but you'll see in the try
and push it and then I need you they
wanted something super high to go with
that so hope you skied mine shoes
they're all sale for $35 what they're
not like the company issue in the world
because this kind of digs into your toes
you know what's high and there's no
platform but there's 30 bucks they may
look really nice and I was doing speak
for so long but I don't know
I wanted a skinny heel and have these
and like a stick heal but this won't be
a fitness to be sex box I can't like
they know exceed my appeal for $35 but
has the second page though so I bought
but hasn't come in yet so it was like
two pairs of glasses and some like
carbon thing I don't know I'm not
nothing too interesting you know
probably on Instagram as I have it up it
in mind that I want to take photos but
