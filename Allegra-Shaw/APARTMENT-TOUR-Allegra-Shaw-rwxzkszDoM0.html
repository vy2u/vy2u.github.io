very requested I'm just gonna walk you
my apartment when I got things I have
lived here for about a year and a half
so it took me this long I would start I
started with absolutely nothing I had no
furniture it took me that long to kind
of get the place to where I'm happy with
it if you have your own place you know
that like you're never done you can
always do more to kind of like change it
up but it did take me a while to get it
to a place where I feel really good
about it I am renting this place so I
couldn't make like a ton of changes I
definitely if I owned this place I would
have made a lot more changes but this is
what I got with my rental and yeah I've
lived here for almost two years now so I
