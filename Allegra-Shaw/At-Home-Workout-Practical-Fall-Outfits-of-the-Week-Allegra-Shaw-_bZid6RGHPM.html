think I'm gonna do like a vlog the sweet
but it's gonna be like it outfits of the
week and also a vlog because I'm getting
a bunch of beauty treatments done that I
wanted to like kind of take you along so
I want this to like be an informative
video yeah
so my first outfit today is late on so
I'm wearing these velvet leather what
wearing these develop it's from Aldo
they sent me them and I love them I do
love all David's I think they're super
comfortable and then I'm wearing black
jeans these are my Jamie jeans from
Topshop and then I'm wearing a tank top
and a sweater from Alsace I'm just
trying to figure out how I want to style
this I think I might tuck it in and then
put a belts on and then I don't think
I'm gonna need a jacket because the
weather's be kind of weird here but it's
just like a really easy casual outfit so
this morning I am going to get a facial
at Dermalogica I put it on my story that
I needed like a theis car recommendation
a lot of people have worse skin than me
I'm just on camera all the time so I do
look really pale this lady guys want to
show you I took photos but like this is
it but like all of this redness is just
scarring I have some swearing like a few
here but it's mostly just on my chin
it's hard to see but you know when I
look in the mirror I can see it and I
sin someone came all the time and since
I don't wear makeup all the time I would
like to get rid of this and have that
like beautiful skin your accompany you
reached out to me and said they would
give me a treatment at the Dermalogica
spa here in trouble
air-ground an elevator in this building
whoa
those knots I missed for elevators to
get up here
so not going to take you the treatment
but I'll tell you how it is after I'm
just getting ready right now look like
such a mess
that was so good oh my god what an
amazing experience
I never treat myself to photos or
anything so okay you couldn't see me
changing I'm just gonna talk I'm sure
I'm dressed okay I just finished my
facial it's getting that overview
definitely I'd love you to pay attention
to happen
get on your daily microphone right this
is definitely gonna help reduce the
scarring that you're experiencing and
how often every sympathy Oh every day
I've used a pretty strong extol you
treatment today Dermalogica
yeah I did a really strong good slowly
so I'm just in today
very well so you can go right ahead
inclusive doing a guy who opens assets
prescribed in every day is it can be
common that you will experience some
searching if there may be some bacteria
especially feature planet or I think
this is have a few on the back your
hands a lightweight oil you can see it
on the new oils very healing for the
skin so post breakout when you've got
that just scab kind of taking its time
to heal spot this collar or put it off
your pure life this is a lightweight
moisturizer which you have on the skin
at the moment
kids hyperpigmentation so these are dark
I do recommend you nights treatment
means microdermabrasion yes and then
what order would you recommend it so
we'll start from you getting I've got a
free cleanse bomb yep your cleanser yeah
you always want to use your kinds of
actives and frequent want to ensure
everything is so pretty cleanse bomb
your cleanser your exfoliate yep and
then you'd go into your serums okay for
example your feature - oil and then your
pure lights yep and then at night time
go through this box right and then
should be moisturizer and the night
cream or eye cream moisturizer does not
really matter it doesn't because you
shouldn't be bringing your eye cream up
to the eye area or your moisturizer up
to the eye area at all Thanks there you
go all right so this is my skin after I
think it looks a lot better
she was say my skin is super dehydrated
but I was so hungover on Saturday I am
24 years old so I'm still recovering
from the hangover she did some
extractions it was just a really luxe
experience and like just informative and
good and like I never treat myself to
facial I just really I really really
enjoyed that and she said I could go
back in six weeks for a
microdermabrasion what you think will
help with the scarring and I got three
free products that suggested so I got
the fight over replenish oil which is
new I got the pure light this is the SPF
50 and then I also got the eye treatment
it's really nice I'm really excited to
add those into my routine and kind of

outfit today I'm just I'm actually want
to get laser hair removal so I'm just
wearing black boots these AllSaints
faded jeans black old sweater from H&amp;amp;M
watch pretty simple and I'm gonna throw
a coat on yeah I have one session
session six weeks ago for laser hair
removal and I'm getting it up the 10
spot and I really really I'm liking it
it doesn't hurt at all and I've had
laser hair removal before and it didn't
work
so that's kind of annoying yeah I didn't
work I got it like a long time ago and
this I can actually see some results
already after one session it's well it's
like super professional they're just
like easy I really really like going
there for anything like they do nails
they do eyebrows through all that stuff
when I've gone there for a while so when
they said that they were doing laser
hair removal I was like I gotta get in
on that and their machine is like really
nice again link doesn't I have a pretty
high hate all pain tolerance but pain
one to ten like at - like it's nothing
it's nothing I have no idea what the
temperature is out so I put on a leather
jacket and then I put on our uncle coat
on top what I really love about uncle
code is that it's like pretty thin but
warm but you can layer it and I love
that this is the small/medium that I'm
wearing I love the layered coat look the
sweater is pretty chunky layer with
though so I'm walking there now
friends so you don't to focus on the
pain I'm obviously not going to show you
because I mean my vagina
I got self tan I got spray tan last week
fun fact you can't do laser window spray
tan so otherwise it's so windy out it's
not even funny I was getting blown away
huh okay so just had my appointment it
was really quick you can't actually get
laser while you're not supposed to if
you have self tan and I spray tan so
don't do that so she couldn't do like
some parts that had the tan on but no
big deal I can just get it next time but
so fast and so painless I just like its
honestly shocking and I got my first
session of my underarms done because who
likes shave their own arms not me and I
don't even have that much hair so I just
went prices vary but check out their
website you're in Canada I'm a big fan
of 10-spot I just put up my meditation
video if you haven't seen that I highly
suggest you watch a lot talk with my
anxiety and meditation in my journey of
meditation and pretty like
nerve-wracking video I just picked my
face pretty nerve-wracking video to put
up when you put yourself you know out
there and tell people what you like one
aspect of what you've been struggling
with I think it's a little bit
nerve-racking for anyone but I hope you
guys receive it well I'm gonna end the
vlog here this has been a crazy week of
vlogging like so much has happened so
hopefully gonna condense it down goodbye
for flogging for now I'll see you on
December 1st I also see you like for the
rest of November uploading videos bye
