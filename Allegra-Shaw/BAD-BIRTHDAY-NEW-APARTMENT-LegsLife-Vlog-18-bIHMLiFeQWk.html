I just arrived at the Drake Hotel in
Toronto I am staying here tonight
because it's my birthday so we're going
out and even like a big thing 23 so I'm
gonna give you a little hotel room tour
because this hotel is so great so here's
the front door and then so you walk in
like this I got the Excel suite because
it is my birthday so I went all I have
like a closet here with some robes but
you know I'm getting in those in like
one minute and then it has this area
here house like this little cool thing
and they gave me some free champagne
which is really nice then this way I
don't know how to turn on the lights
so and then the bed here and like every
room is different so it's really
eclectic and cool and then I haven't
even been in the bathroom yet so this is
the bathroom shower and all that yeah oh
this is the hotel I'm very happy with it
it's honestly a beautiful hotel and it's
a boutique hotel in Toronto on West
Queen West and I'm very excited for my
birthday so I'm going to just like chill
get in my robe probably get some food
and then I'm gonna start getting ready
and I'm gonna do get ready with me video
probably in here me those are great
great lighting and I brought my camera
and everything so I'll film naught and
then dinner and doing dinner with some
friends and then pre drinking and going
out so that is what I'm doing so so it's
like two days after my birthday I made
you really vlog that night because I've
just kind of got really hectic so
basically I'm very upset with the Drake
Hotel
I love the aesthetic of the Drake Hotel
I love like I loved the room the room
was epic but the service was extremely
disappointing and I don't want to like
talk about the establishment
because I what the Drake is all about
like I'm so into but basically they like
 up my entire birthday and I'm
just really upset about it
so got there the room was great as you
saw it was so beautiful I got the
biggest room in the Drake Hotel so
obviously pretty expensive we needed to
add more people to the dinner
reservation and they just wouldn't
accommodate like I just feel like if
you're if you have the biggest room even
though you have a room at the Drake like
you're obviously guests there and like
they should be accommodating to you to
add someone - we had to have three
people and we even said like you know
I've got another table we can just throw
some extra chairs around the the
original table and that's fine like
we're we'll accommodate and they were
like absolutely not so that's so
we couldn't add more people to the
dinner reservation so instead of them
accommodating they actually lost you
know ten bills like ten different
people's bills we had to go somewhere
else which you know getting a dinner
reservation for ten at that late was
really hard and then we kind of got
screwed over for dinner and I ended up
eating dinner at like 11:00 or like at
10:30 and then we get back to the Drake
and they won't allow anyone in my room
like I'm sorry I paid money for this
mine residence wide why are you they're
not sleeping there we're literally
there's a lounge area in the room we're
gonna go have a few drinks and we're
gonna leave before 12:00 we're gonna
leave before 12 p.m. sorry 12 a.m. and
they just wouldn't dive food on me
and I just wouldn't allow it and it just
was like so it was just so insane that
they wouldn't allow it when they were
saying like noise and stuff but the
Drake Hotel at night is a bar so if you
go there you shouldn't expect this like
quiet peaceful room especially on a
Saturday night when the floor is
literally vibrating from the club
downstairs I'm not gonna make more noise
than that and it wasn't like I was like
20 people it was literally like 13
people maybe in total so like any other
hotel you can literally like house many
people as you want in your room cuz you
paid for it but they wouldn't let us
back into the hotel it was honestly
insane so and I couldn't have a Prejean
can you do a straight the bar and it was
just like they literally just up
my entire birthday and I'm just very
very upset with it and I don't want to
be upset with a drape cuz I actually
love like everything else about it so
that was my experience but other than
that I had a really good night hey my
hope it was great makeup turned out well
and yeah so I just needed to say that
because I was like just so upset and
disappointed but I feel like if your
birthday doesn't go well the year will
be great that's what I hope so I'm just
furniture shopping online and oh my god
furniture is so expensive I don't know
how I'm going to for initial whole place
they've literally been looking on like
the free stuff section in Kijiji cuz I
feel like I could get some cool stuff
off there and like trying to refurbish
it because I literally can't afford to
furnish a whole place is gonna cost like
conservatively five thousand dollars
which is a ton of money and like need to
pay rent and stuff on top of that and
it's just it's just insane like have a
lot will do this um so yeah couches are
like a thousand dollars like what but I
got some glasses like cups and I got
like utensils not
not only flatware but you know like
spatulas and stuff so that's how far I
am into the things that I own what's
most important is I get my bed which I
found a bed that I'm down to have for
pretty cheap hey guys so I just got the
keys to my new apartment and I was
really excited so I wanted to just share
with you because I have some vlog clips
so I'm just gonna sneak this into the
little vlog so this is the first tour
that I'm gonna do obviously when it's
furnished I'm going to do another tour
and my friend Bentley who has a company
called rain interiors is helping me
furnish the whole place so you'll be
able to see the whole process which is
great okay so here's the door and then
to the left is a closet which is nice
and then the bathroom is here
I guess I'll switch the camera around
everything's pretty small I mean it is
Toronto so it's pretty small so right
here is the washer/dryer and this is my
room yeah it's a half wall if you can
see it's a half wall so doesn't go all
the way which is actually nice because
it just makes the space way more open to
new and then the kitchen
I mean it's all kind of one thing the
kitchens right here I get a little
island I have a nice balcony it's really
hard to tell when there's nothing here
yeah it's so exciting
look at this natural light I'll be able
to film in rid of this oh my god look
this is like perfect lighting
but yeah this is my new place it's small
and perfect for me and I'm so excited so
yeah I just got I'm just like looking at
the apartment and stuff I have to figure
some stuff out I have some meetings
today so just leaving the apartment now
just asked like if you're familiar with
the building or if you like see anything
that would kind of like compromise where
I live just like don't put in the
comments as basically all I asked
because honestly if you live in Toronto
and you've been in that building before
it'll look familiar so all the units
look pretty much the same um so yeah
just keep that in mind please and yeah
it's gonna be so exciting because it
kind of gives me like a whole new video
what is it like a new subject
you know like furnishing my place which
is crazy oh okay so I used to go to but
yes so I just got internet at my new
place so I guess I should probably start
sleeping here since I haven't really
been sleeping here I would see me at my
parents house still I need to my
mattress should be coming tomorrow um so
I have a mattress pad right now the
place is a disaster still but I got my
closet kind of set up my bed
well my bed I made and stained white and
then I'm like trying to make stuff I
don't know
oh but I'm you know progress oh you can
see the cupboards getting there
everything we're getting there we're
getting there it's a process though I
still have to move a bunch of stuff but
I'm just so tired you know moving is
just so tiring
and I don't have any tools here so what
can't make anything more I put up
shelves so I need to go get tools
but I don't know if I should sleep here
tonight or not I'm just starting to edit
this vlog I'm wearing this shirt in like
every vlog clip I'm just starting
to edit this long now that goes all the
way back to my birthday it's about
February 8th now birthday was January
