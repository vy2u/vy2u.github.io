and then I deleted it so I have five six
tips for you to start your gym career it
is 2016 it is beginning of 2016 a lot of
people want to you know lifestyle or
have a lifestyle change and that
sometimes involves going to the gym the
gym can be a very daunting place it can
be a little intimidating there are a lot
of men especially if you're a girl there
are women's only gym so that's a really
good option but um it could be kind of a
scary place so I'm gonna give you five
or six tips on how to make your first
gym experience a good experience and to
how to feel not so uncomfortable while
you're there didn't always have a
comfortable outfit that you feel
comfortable in so um I recommend
leggings or pants for your first time so
you're not constantly pulling down your
shorts and I recommend a tank top or
t-shirt something kind of slim fit that
you can still do the exercises in but
nothing too tight where like your boobs
are pouring out or you know you want to
be in your outfit and feel secure
confident a good pair of shoes that you
feel confident in because if you feel
good you will leave more focused on your
workout than like oh my god is my ass
showing
number two is have a plan and stick with
that plan
so before you go to the gym do some
research on you know what you're going
to accomplish up at gym so your first
time going there you want to do a light
day look up our workout routine that you
feel like you can accomplish out the gym
and stick with that routine look up how
to do the moves the form and write it
down either your phone or a piece of
paper and write it down and have it
there with you you can even write little
notes on how to remember how to do the
perfect form and then when you're there
if you forget you can always look
something up but yeah have a have a plan
um and stick with it so you're not like
looking around when I do I don't want to
do sometimes for me when I was like that
I would I would look around
to do and then I would just leave
because I feel so overwhelmed so having
a plan is definitely the best tip that I
can give you number three is have music
or have a hat or both and have a
playlist ready to go something that's up
eat and fun and what you like the
headphones will help you keep focus and
won't I always work out headphones
I hate listening to the men scream and
row I just hate that so I love that
music this just really keeps me focused
keeps me in the zone um and kind of
blocks out all the other noise that's
really good as well because it kind of
gives you blinders so you're not looking
at other people and then you feel like
you know they're not looking at you
which they're not but a hat is just like
a nice little extra accessory that you
can put on to make you feel a little
better
I always wear out my hair's really
greasy great tip number of toys focus on
yourself and what you're doing don't
worry about what that guys doing what
that girl's doing or you know focus on
your own routine focus on what your
gonna wait you're accomplishing where
the burn is what you're feeling really
get into your workout look in the mirror
to look at your form like that's the
best way to keep in your own head and
block other people no one is looking at
you I don't want to focus on themselves
so just focus on yourself and your work
number five is start small with weight
and then work your way up you don't want
to like take a huge weight and then you
can't carry and you drop in and what
I've already to start small ease into
things you know if your first workout
you can only really stay on the mat and
do bodyweight that's okay you have to
feel comfortable with yourself and what
you're doing I know when I first started
working out I would do like 10 minutes
of cardio and while I was doing cardio I
would look around the gym to see where
all the machines were that I was going
to used for my workout that's what I
would do
number six so
if you are starting out and you were
later I'm sure about form you can always
take it class thing classes are really
great um cuz there's a teacher that help
there's a teacher there to help you with
your form or you could hire a personal
trainer like a one session I know a good
life gives you like a free personal
training session which is always great
and they can really teach you the form
they can show you the machines they can
show you how to use the machines making
sure you how to you know what weights
you should be using so that's always
great for starting out in the gym or you
can bring a friend along like me who is
um you know more acquainted with the gym
understands you know working out and
it's like good good at working out and
then they can help you along with your
workout you can you'll feel a little
less intimidating when you're with a
friend because they will help you and
then you can kind of like have your
focus with that if you don't even so
those are nice extents for how to start
your new year in the gym and um if you
guys do this video I hope it was helpful
if have any other questions you can
leave now below I have like five workout
routines on my channel which I will also
link down below so you can check those
out and a lot of those you don't even
really have to venture into the weight
room you can kind of just use the mat so
that's always great um thank you so much

we'll have some more like in the gym
workout routines up for you guys but
would not love you so much thank you
peace love woo your new me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
