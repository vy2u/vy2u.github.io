coming up and this is the first video on
my back to school series I'm gonna be
doing probably just like some outfits
maybe some advice videos but yeah not
really going back to school this year
which is like very very weird for me I
have been going back to school my whole
life and this is the first year that I
am not but this is something that I
would have totally weren't on my first
day back to either high school or even
university doesn't really matter as much
as the university but you want to look
put together you want to look nice when
look tanned and fresh and summery but
you don't want to look overdone up
because if you're over dumped the first
day of school and then the second day of
school you look like a bum kind of
really defeats the purpose so we just
want to look very put together and very
tanned and fresh and like you just have
an amazing summer in the Sun so this
would I put together it's using a lot of
multi-purpose products so this is a look
that you can wear everyday at school and
it'll only take you like when I recorded
it to be 10 minutes so 10 minutes it's
pretty good and that was like with
camera difficulty so probably take you
like 5 minutes I also use a lot of new
tix products I just think they're super
versatile really easy to use and just
like blend really nicely the outfit
super simple you know like just really
nice so so gonna look see how to get
this look keep watching so I'm just
grabbing the bodyshop tea tree oil
putting that all over my face because my
skin sucks and they break out all the
time and I'm taking the Maybelline fit
me concealer and I'm kind of using this
as a foundation sort of so I'm just
covering up any areas that need to be
covered up which is essentially my whole
face at this point so just gonna cover
that up and then blend it out
something
then I'm scrubbing my a nude sticks
concealer in medium four and I'm kind of
using this to give my face a little more
definition a little more depth so I'm
just taking this putting some of the
eyes to brighten up the under eye area
then I'm taking this Revlon nearly naked
powder in medium and just setting
everything that I have done with a large
fluffy brush
then just gonna add a little warmth to
the face with my Bobbi Brown bronzer in
natural and just gonna put that in any
areas where the Sun would naturally kiss
your face
then I'm taking one of my favorite nude
sticks the color love and I'm gonna be
putting this on my cheeks this is super
creamy and blendable and it's such a
pretty color
then I'm taking the nude six an angel
and I'm just gonna put this on top of my
lids and it's just a really natural
shimmery color it won't look like you
have a lot of makeup on but will kind of
just give your eyes this nice Sheen I'll
also be using this as a highlight it's
just such a pretty color
then I am just taking a black eyeliner
and then I'm taking a Lancome mascara
and just do my normal thing then again
grabbing that new six and love and you
know as my lip color so it's gotten a
very versatile product that you can use
on lips and cheeks so that's all for the
makeup as I said a very simple versatile
not to me like what five minutes and now
on to hair my hair is a little bit
greasy I'm sure you'd want to shower but
I don't wash my hair every day so I'm
taking this dry shampoo putting in the
top and then throwing into a high very
Arianna esque ponytail
in Canada you don't get to wear dresses
very often so I love to wear dress in
the first day back I'm just wearing this
shirt from brandy melville jean-jacques
from Abercrombie back up commercial
converse sneakers and you're set so
casual and kills alright well that's it
for now thanks for watching and have a
great first day back at school</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
