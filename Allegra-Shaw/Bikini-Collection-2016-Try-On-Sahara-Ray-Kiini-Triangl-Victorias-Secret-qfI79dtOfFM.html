collection video I did one of these last
year but I wanted to update one because
I've taken at a lot of keys of take them
out a lot take them out of my collection
I'm really scared this paintings in foam
I have a cannot move
I'm taking some out of my collection
I've bought some new ones and I got a
few online and I find getting sizes
online really difficult so I wanted to
help you guys if you were thinking but
ordering some online
some of them are the same as last year
um and I will show you maybe I should
move to the side so to the side you know
to the size that I can put like a split
screen and I can show you what the key
looks like right here wait
so the first bikini this is a new bikini
it's from triangle and obviously like
you know triangle is it's everywhere but
they came out I used to not really like
their designs and they can post a new
ones that are actually very cute and it
fits beautifully and I would highly
recommend I think I'm going to get a few
more because I really really like the
way this fits so I got this one not sure
what it's called to have everything
linked down below
my personal shop obviously um but it's
this one with the near my head with the
floral bought it was in the green top
and so when I talked to the person you
can like chat with triangle people
online I talked to one of the people and
they told me to old order a small and I
ordered a small top that is um in it fit
but it wasn't like tight so like it fit
whatever but I felt like if I was like
doing water sports whatever it would
totally fall off so I actually returned
and I got an extra small return Ross's I
was actually pretty easy kind of
obviously as an inconvenience but it
wasn't difficult got an extra small on
this and I got an extra small in this
my bus is a 32 scene Babbitt said it's a
small 32 C so yeah and my bottoms my
waist is a 24 my hipster like a 25 so
I'm a very small person so extra small
is usually my size and I think this fits
really well
I like the neoprene I like the cheeky
bottoms I didn't like the old bottoms
where it was like full bottom that's I
think why didn't order for me before but
I love the QI bottoms I think it's
really just a really nice bikini and it
fits well and I feel very comfortable in
it and I feel like I'm not only gonna
fall out of it which I really like so
highly recommend this bikini think and
the nice thing is it's ninety dollars
American kind of expensive opinions but
not always American and you get the
whole bikini which is very rare it's
like set I like that a lot
triangle love that and the next one is a
bikini from kini I also got an extra
small in this and I started small
because I think they only run small
medium large and this is the white one
it's really hard to show and there's no
ponds just make very flimsy it's knit
crochet it fits really nicely and the
bottoms look like this kind of cheeky
bum but I like that in a bathing suit I
like the white I like the way it fits
the only it's not see-through I went in
the water it's not see-through but
obviously there's no padding so you can
see the nipples again I got a small it
fits me perfectly actually the top is
like a little bit too small my boobs it
kind of like falling out but F oh that's
more like a cool
you know you know there's like beach
bikinis cottage bikinis pool bikinis
something that's like a pool bikini um
then there is this one that I got two
years ago from Victoria's Secret
torski was actually discontinuing their
bikinis that's why I'm not gonna go into
huge detail about them because they're
knocking bikinis anymore and it's this
one I haven't won this one in a really
long time but I didn't want to give it
away cuz it's my only strapless sort of
he's just as floral bikini has some
padding in it just nice nice little
underwire and then the bottoms are these
little kind of cheeky bikini bottoms and
those are really cute um the next one is
the heart rate I actually just got this
one have a warning yet but I've tried on
um this is also pretty this is a like an
expensive bikini but I don't wear my
bikinis like all the time if they're
going to get ruined whatever so being
this for me lost a very long time so I
don't really have a problem spending
some money on them because I'm going to
wear them like quite a bit in the summer
and when I go away and like I don't feel
like I'm reading them you know I mean
that's my logic anyway and so it's just
a black like bra top looks like this
again no padding kind of into that if
it's like a bralette it's very similar
to like their bitsy a bra lat I got an
extra small nope I lied I got a small in
the top I got a small in the top because
I think this at the model was wearing a
small and like it looked really tiny and
like I looked like I had bigger boobs on
her so I got this small and it fits
perfectly so um small was good for me
and then I got these bottoms not the
ones that are supposed to go with this
top I got the like ones that look like
this they're like the thong ones they're
nice don't even say is like the front is
really thick like the front leg goes on
to my legs kind of I don't know if it's
comfortably and like it definitely is
like covered like your vagina is covered
which obviously you want but I think I'm
going to order the bottom
go with this top as well just have some
variety because you know I love a black
bikini but it is good quality it is how
expensive oh that's the only thing next
is this one I bought this a while ago
from vote a swim extra small in both and
this is the top that makes your boobs
look really nice um purple frilly it's
kind of girly for me but I think it'd
work um makes your tits just look
phenomenal
and then the bottoms are cheeky scrunchy
bum bottoms make it bomb look really
cute I would get that bikini in black no
frills don't be amazing um next one I
think I had this last year this is also
from Victoria's Secret it's just a mesh
white bikini feel like everyone hot only
gotta have a little bird I like hangs
out on my dad now um mesh bikini and
then the top I like this top because
there's no tying needed it just hooks
together so you don't get those like
tight and lines on your back pretty
makes your body look nice um what should
we do
I'm just like stick my hand here to God
I was like funbags like what do we have
next
uh this one it gives me one I don't
think it's the Sasha this is a
reversible dating suit from vitamin I
want to get this right one is vitamin A
swim
this one's reversible which is great too
because you two bathing suits in one I
mean this side isn't that nice but it's
not bad I like definitely morning on the
side so it's just like snake sins or
print again kind of cheeky and then the
top I don't know how I'm going to show
you
is one of those talks that like Criss
crosses around your bodies so you like
put it on like this and then it goes
like okay I can't show you but it is
reversible block and a snakeskin and I
think it's a really pretty bikini and I
like the wraps around body eight I think
it makes your body look really nice and
she's absolutely different to a bikini
obviously you'll see like how it looks
right here so just like show you these
strings this line is also I really like
this one a lot just gives you kind of a
weird tan this is from geek Soto and the
print is this these are the bottoms I
really like the print I think it's
really nice and summery and those
bottoms and then the top is one of those
like high neck halter tops and anything
that your body look just like really
nice and it hits like a nice place kind
of to look curvy and I need that somehow
very curvy um and I really like the high
knife although it does give you a kind
of a weird tan not gonna lie and then
now we're getting to sit oh no I have
one more this one I'm not sure if I had
last year oh yeah I definitely did this
is also reversible and very nice but
it's one of those has like those strings
very boho I like the top it goes like
that has these strings hanging down you
have pink or Discworld sorry the coral
or the mint side and the bottoms are
cheeky it's just like very I said this
already but very boho and has these
things hanging down really love that
bikini
I love bikinis they're just like so nice
I wish I had lived in a place where you
like wear bikini every day would be the
life okay these ones are kind of just
like my miscellaneous ones um I have
this one piece I got rid of the other
one piece just cause like I don't really
wear one pieces but I still like this
one think one pieces make you look
pretty sexy I think like colors of this
one I would love a black one as well but
I never really wear them because I want
to get a tan like him in a bikini I'll
probably want to beat and so yeah but
this one makes your body look very very
nice
I hope you can see right here um like
damn girl I would just compliment myself
um this is from Victoria's Secret so you
can't get this something they're just
continuing as I said but there are tons
of one he says they're so on-trend oh
yeah these are from Old Navy and I think
well maybe if you're looking for a
budget-friendly bikini I think that they
have great budget-friendly bikinis this
is just the right one it has faded
because I've worn it so many times but
these are full bottom key knees and then
it's just a triangle classic triangle
halter top I think they just are
flattering and awesome they've lasted
such a long time and I'm pretty sure
that was $20 so if you're looking for
wonder from the bikini I highly
recommend Old Navy I think my phone as
well I'm sure and then I got rid of the
or having to have that one in black -
I'm the same red bikini and black and
then I kept I threw out I gave away the
bottoms this the key but I don't know I
kinda like the top if you like maybe I
could get some wear out of it so um
Samara can flag top bikini top and then
I just kept these bottoms because maybe
I don't want to wear this sort of bikini
that I felt like the American flag laws
were just too much so I think the white
would look kind of cute together
that's from Old Navy and the bombs are
from Victoria's Secret um and then I had
I just have these block bottoms from
Victoria's Secret
because they're scratching moment
they're still like cover so you know
when you just like need you need to wear
bathing suit but you don't want it to be
like sexy because if you're with your
family or something so I just keep some
bathing suits around like this and then
I just have an old lady talk to wear
with that that's my baby suit collection
I really really like cut it in half some
flasher I know it is a lot of I have a
lot of bathing suits I do know that um
but I've plucked them over the years and
I really love them all and I feel happy
with my bikini collection other than I'm
going to buy those other black bottoms
but feel happy with it and I think I've
collected a good good collection a good
variety over the over the last you know
five years six years body hasn't changed
that much in that long so I hope that
you've got most helpful if any questions
