my bathing suits collection I'm sort of
summer so I'm going to show you all of
my baby suits that I own I will not be
purchasing any more bathing suits this
summer I have a plethora of bathing
suits
samp let's just jump right into it and
most of them are Victoria's Secret just
cuz they're most accessible but a lot of
them are Old Navy as well is this one
from Victoria's Secret I had this I have
another bikini kind of collection this
one's just a little more in depth than
bigger this isn't or one firm but two
years ago just flower detail strapless
it comes with a strap but I never wear
the strap um it's like kind of rusting a
little bit that's gross
yeah it has an underwire some padding
and the bottoms are these floral scrunch
bum Chiki I don't think these figs is
available anymore but it's a I really
like this cut of bathing suit that
Victoria Secret has it's really nice
makes your boobs look nice and my next
one is from Old Navy I have a couple of
these in a couple different colors I'm
going to show you them all at the same
time
see it's an American flag bikini it's
just an old from Old Navy I think I got
for literally five dollars um looks like
this and then the bottoms are just full
bottoms with tie strings and I have this
bathing suit in black in red and I have
the top in white so this is kind of like
my go-to making a love triangle bikinis
I think they make my body with the
nicest so that's what I usually go with
um so here are like this is the red
these are the bottoms I'm not sure the
top is but yeah this is like definite my
favorite bikini just the old navy
triangle bikini and they're very very
inexpensive which is nice the next one I
have is this one from Victoria Secrets
just leopard print has like a gold thing
in the middle
how does like built-in pads I really
hate this top it just like doesn't sit
properly
uh it like shifts around a lot it
doesn't really have a lot of give so I
don't like this top at all
I'm only one of the things you like once
or twice and then the bottoms are okay
there they're all right there pretty
nice um they look like that they're a
little bit cheeky but no too much um
it's okay I don't really recommend this
sort of troms√∏ by don't like the
Victoria's Secret triangle tops it's not
only thing um the next one I haven't
actually worn this one before tags are
still on it this is a vota swimwear I
was given this one my friend who owns a
store Cologne a um that'll be linked
below if you want to check out there
anything suits but it's this purple one
I just don't like the ruffles like I'm
just not that girly I think it's really
cute if here this is your style but I'm
just really not girly um scrunchie
um tie bottoms and then the top makes
your boobs look just amazing that's what
it's meant to voda bikinis have this
like special technology that makes your
boobs look wonderful and it really
really does so this is the top I'll
probably wear this top with like some
different balls so it will be out
shortly
this one's pretty expensive I think but
um everything will be linked down below
so this is the bottoms for the black Old
Navy
so yeah just black and I have this top
from airy it's kind of the wrong size oh
my god a size too big but it's nice I
just have the top in this and I kind of
just mix and match this cute not only
big family push-up bikinis out of ours
whatever and then this is the white top
from Old Navy it's kind of dirty because
I've worn it so much but that's the
white top and then to go with that
because I do want to wear that when I'm
going to Greece in a few days so I
wanted to wear white bikini um I just
got Victoria Secret bottoms to match it
the whites are kind of different though
like whatever a big deal
um this agency it's really cute it's
hard to get on but it's cute so this is
from Victoria's Secret and it's gonna be
very difficult to show though it is a
triangle top like this
and then the back is like this racerback
kind of things a gold chain it's really
really cute on cute print and the
bottoms I don't know if they saw this
one anymore at the bottoms are just like
regular bottoms really hit print on them
um and then I have this black top this
is from Victoria's Secret yep
so this is like one of those push-up
tops I don't really wear this one that
often it's okay again I like the
triangle ones more then they like
push-up you ones but it's nice and then
I like black bathing suits are literally
my favorite mating suits so I don't
really know why I purchased so many
suits because I just always resort back
to my black triangle one so I have two
black triangle tops because I just go
through them like I just like having a
bunch of different on hand because they
are my favorite what else oh this is my
newest or I had two new bikinis and they
are amazing um this they're from
Victoria's Secret there again for my
trip to Greece um it's just this white
mesh bikini like and I like that it
doesn't have ties it just like makes it
a lot more clean and um the tan lines
will be a lot better so it's just mesh
and then bottoms like this just regular
kind of bottoms mesh
I love the mesh print it's really sporty
and cute and then this one I am just
like obsessed with my of again another
newest one from Victoria's Secret it's
reversible which is epic and so in my
clip I have both designs on so you can
see it I'll probably wear like that like
one design on the bottom one design the
top and okay so the top looks like this
it has these dangly things in the front
and these day my things in the back it's
just like really different it needs kind
of sporty and boho and all these things
so the one side is like this kind of
blue cheetah print in the fish eyes is
quarrel there's a couple different
colors this is available right now if
you want to get this but I do love this
bikini I would purchase it in different
colors if Victoria Secret wasn't so
expensive on lime to Canada and then the
bottoms are cheeky like this again
reversible which is epic to bikinis in
one love that and then I have a bunch of
like song bikinis that I wear when I
like go away
um this one has faded very much so this
one's faded a lot this is from pakka
ooo-ooo lo ha Aloha and I think it's cuz
I wore it in chlorine it is crazy faded
but it's just like a thong bikini like
this I have this block and then I have a
red one that's kind of similar to that
and then I have one so I have two full
pieces but I don't want one is um I have
a full piece just for fun I wore it for
work because I need two one piece bikini
and it just says Sun surf sunset on it
this cool mature thing and then the back
this is like a racerback
it's pretty cool pretty nice um I don't
really wear one-piece is a lot of more
of a two-piece kind of girl kind of
quick video those are all my bikinis I
