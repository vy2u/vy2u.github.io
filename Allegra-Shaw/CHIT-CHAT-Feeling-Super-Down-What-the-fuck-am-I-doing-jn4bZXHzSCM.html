funk I haven't filmed anything yet so
I've just been like working on
other companies and we're going through
like a lot of changes right now I don't

because I just like haven't been posting
and you post any videos last week yeah I
go my phones went crazy right now um so
basically what's going on is so as you
guys know I own two clothing store
companies sort of thing and what we've
decided to do as I told you is we're
gonna close bladder eggs so by the way
if you want to purchase on Gladrags
actually this week you can go on click
Change comm you can purchase a coupon
code and you get 35% off your

addictive see on sale we're just try get
rid of inventory everything that song
vibrates it's not gonna be available
anymore and then what we're gonna do is
we're just gonna do uncle
so uncle is my clothing brand making
t-shirts and like sweatshirts and
graphics and it's really cool so I
really love you guys could follow us on
Instagram uncle peril Uncle Caroline
Instagram and it's like really kind of
graphic pictures whatever but once we
get our new question out they'll be like
tons of cool pictures and then what
we're gonna do with the Gladrags
Instagram squad Mexico if you want to
follow us there is we're gonna turn into
like a like a vintage sort of like like
a tumblr but on Instagram so it'd be
like a tumblr like my tumblr feed but on
Instagram because we want to like I
don't know I feel like that Instagram is
like a way for me to be like creative
and post pictures that I like but I
don't really fit with my Instagram feed
so that'll kind of be like I created out
of it and that the name will change
everything and we'll make some cool like
vintage tumblr sort of thing but so
everything that I'm doing clothing wise
is going to be on uncle and we're doing
something really cool collabs and it's
gonna be really great we're gonna we're
gonna make like and some of the pieces
like the t-shirt dress
we will probably bring over to Uncle and
kind of make it different and it'll be
like an uncle sort of online T t-shirt
dress what everything is the works
everything take changing right now and
I'm just like a lot of change and yeah I
just like really want to get the ball
rolling on like closing god right - I
just want to sell it over inventory so
we can really focus on Cologne make it
like such an amazing company uh yeah
just like I don't know
I feel like everyone goes through lulls
that like know whenever I mean I think
people film about them but I have never
like filmed really saying you know that
I've been feeling like shit so um I
honestly get my stuff I feel like it's
like the changing seasons you know I'm
seasons change everywhere kind of feels
like weird and mine usually happens at
the end of August but just like the last
two weeks I've just been so tired like
can't fall asleep and I sit a little
sleeping late and I just feel like I
haven't been like in a good place so
that's why my videos haven't been up to
par but if you have any suggestions
whenever like comment down below I will
be doing a permit tour
I just need to finish a few things and
then I promise I'll be doing a perimeter
I hung all my pictures so that's good I
seek it to side tables some layouts and
carpet and then I'm gonna end fix this
bar Kurt situation and and then I
promise I will film in apartment or it
will be up by like I'm guessing in
November it'll be up so that is coming
really all I have to say just kind of
want to film like this video and if you
want to see the Halloween tutorials I'll
do them and I'll just post them all like
in one week and it won't follow a bit
like I'll just post post them all I be
like every time I do one I'll just put
it up and yeah so I don't know if I
should should I show you some stuff
Fillion when war breaks or there's like
my foot this is like my favorite sweater
of all time this is the please don't
make it harder sweater it's white
sweater and I love wearing white in the
winter I know you're not like not really
supposed to but I love wearing the white
sweater with like a like a white like
tank and even the black pants and boots
think it looks really good so sir please
we'll make a purchase order and I love
this sweater it's a strokes lyric we
have tons of like shorts and stuff if
you're in the southern hemisphere
and you're going into summer right now
we have like all of our shorts like on
sale like crazy on sales so for like
what they are they're like one teaspoon
like really great shorts so those are on
sale and yeah the quick change thing is
really cool I guess I should just
explain with this so basically you buy a
coupon code through clip change and they
get thirty five percent off your order
on black bags and a dollar of the okay
wait so you buy your coupon code and the
dollar of that goes to get real and get
real is a organization charity
organization or non-profit organization
for the LGBT community and spreading
awareness and you know fighting for
LGBTQ rights and my friend Chris owns it
and it's a great organization center
every while it's pretty big in Canada so
yeah I think that's a really great cause
and like if you're gonna buy something
anyway you're gonna get 30% off our our
website and you're gonna support a great
cause and we did them off because I
thought it was kind of confusing to I'm
that I think the coupon code is five
dollars and 25 cents but you own to make
that worthwhile all you need to do is
spend $18 so if you're gonna buy
something it's it's worth it if you're
gonna spend over $80 and I'm pretty sure
there's nothing on her website under $80
so it's worth it whatever you're gonna
buy yeah other than that's I hoped just
like I'm just gonna get back into this
thing I just want to film this video
because I kind of want to talk to you
guys and like I missed you that weird
we were really friends I like actually
miss you I was like I haven't talked to
him in so long um so yeah I want to show
you this part of my life I guess I had
this like clip in a vlog and I was like
so upset and I like film the clip and
then I didn't put it and I kind of
regret it not putting it in so I want
you guys to see that like you know life
isn't always like boom boom boom like
upbeat fast global Bloods like you go
through these like shitty kind of lulls
