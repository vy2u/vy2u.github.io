9:30 and I'm not dressed appropriately
for the weather at all I'm wearing a
sweater and shoes actually in an outfit
video but it's freezing but what
can you do well you can dress better for
the weather today just going to my
Tuesday meetings probably gonna get my
nails done cuz I leave Milan tomorrow to
pick a winner for the Traci Fashion Show
or sorry the winner for the nail mo u
London nail thing and I have to film
Victoria Secret Fashion Show
today but I couldn't say to everybody I
think I think now
it is seventh grade
remember
they're just good incentive money
but I can fit
the other love you
for sure in public in public because
actually but we're adults
Josh went home meeting my nails done
I got Sherlock it's called topless beach
it's okay
I don't know Norman not great but it's
too dark to film Victoria's Secret look
now before the fashion show so I think
I'm just gonna film it tomorrow and put
it up for you tomorrow just you want to
do it sorry I'm just sitting here
thinking now like is there even a point
in doing a Victoria's Secret Fashion
Show makeup look because I feel like I
just like looked on YouTube and you can
like find the actual makeup artist
telling you so I feel like it's kind of
stupid to even do that so I don't think
I'm gonna do that anymore and I'm just
gonna film like I don't know probably
nothing but I have a lookbook coming on
Friday so that's exciting so I feel like
economy so for this well whatever
so sorry I haven't walked today it just
been so busy running around but I did
leave worst experience ever I
went to the in-center because I needed
to pick up a bag it's travel with I
don't really have like a big purse so I
had one in mine so I just like went
right to Massimo Dutti
went there bought the purse well like
picked it up went to cash register I
looked at the price they thought was 165
dollars so I'm like perfect like a
little expensive but you know what can
you do yeah that was in Euros
so then it was like too late by the time
I purchased it and I just know God
so I might return it because I don't
think I want to spend that much money on
a purse and then I and then I need a
laptop case so like where you gonna get
a laptop case I don't know oh the Apple
store yeah
Apple stores a disaster I just wonder
like why do you people go to the Apple
store to just hang out why like I just
don't get it don't do that and then yeah
I didn't how many cases I went
everywhere and I'm sweating and I want
to die so yeah I'm gonna go about Combe
do you work and then hopefully go before
my flight tonight and find a lot buggies
so I finally got home and I made myself
a little pomegranate bowl as well as
some fun fruity water and now I'm just
going to actually even open some
administrate what I got today and then
I'm gonna film the video where room is
really messy so don't judge but first I
got this skirt just on sale Black Friday
it's one teaspoon and yes I got that
skirt I got this like gray jacket um cuz
I wanted a gray one I got it a medium
didn't have a small so I think I might
have to get it taken in but it was
really cheap it's got on sale with the
promo code so looks like that I'm sure
this will be a no fit video and then get
ready for this one actually I got this
laptop case because I needed one for
myself this is the purse I got it I
don't you can see it really well this
light but has these like studs on the
bottom and I can really find anything
just this big like it's huge
so it's like absolutely perfect for
travel I can even use this if I like one
away like one night you know so purse I
just tried the jacket on and it's
actually I don't even need it tailored
not let I'm wearing great outfit
but like that if I'm wearing a t-shirt
right now but if I was wearing a sweater
I feel like it would actually be fine
who knew that I could be a medium at
forever 21 also look at this painting
that my cousin did so good
Bobby done one on Instagram I just got
so much work accomplished in the last
three hours
it is crazy so now look at my room how
friggin gross is that I need to pack Oh
water's lemony yeah
not sure I want
oh they have gluten-free and vegetarian
options
but they're all possible so I'm gonna
try to get this vlog up tonight before I
leave and then so this might be the last
vlog see anyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
