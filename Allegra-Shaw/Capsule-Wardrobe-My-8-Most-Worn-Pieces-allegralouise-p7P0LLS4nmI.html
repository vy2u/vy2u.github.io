something so today I'm going to do a
most worn items video this is to go
along with like my capsule collection
kind of thing that I'm doing gonna take
like three of these items plus like
another thing and do like a whole
capsule video works like 20 something
outfits with everything that is used on
my capsule wardrobe blog post I'm going
to do that video it just it is a lot of
changing so I need to have like so much
energy to do it but today I'm going to
show you my top I think it's eight most
worn items using my favorite items in my
wardrobe the items I always like reach
to so they are kind of basic but I love
them and they're just my favorite so
let's just get started the first item is
these black coated jeans I will have I
will try them on so you can see fully
but black coated jeans are just like my
go-to all year round summer winter I
love the look of them I just think
they're like super sleek and nice these
are from Topshop they are these are size
25 and the length is 5:30
I just tried on I went in because I
don't like how short they are I don't
really like crop pants that much
especially black pants their lunch looks
like my legs look really long doctor
wear like a super high feel appease but
I tried on like tall ones I think are
like a 32 or 33 leg or something and
they were amazing so I'm going to buy
the tall jeans I'm not even tall but my
coccyx but I finally like they come up
higher it is longer and it's because
they fit me better so I'm going to get
these do's and Jamie jeans by the way my
love of goods code is block Jean I think
they're just so easy
off and they just look really good my
old favorite pair was the all super they
don't so many more and they ripped the
Jamie jeans are pretty good and they're
only about $95 which is pretty good for
jeans so I think that if you don't
prepare coated black jeans in your
wardrobe you gotta get on that because
they are askew of her pants the second
pair of pants are mom jeans
I wouldn't say these are like my
favorite fit no I wouldn't do that my
favorite like wash and like team they
are like super thick Jean and I found
them kind of hard to wear in the summer
because it's like super hot out but
there's like tons of your mom jeans is
the ones that I have I just a lot based
on which comes down the pairs I like
well I did that they ripped the bezel
differently I remember I was thinking
buy them anymore but these are American
Apparel high-waisted like 80s mom jeans
and I did cut the bottoms off to make
them not frayed I just didn't like how
tight the bottoms were so I was like
 those when I cut it but I gravitate
towards these all the time I think they
make a note to look really like in style
and like chic but in like a really
stylish way they look really nice like a
belt and a button-down shirt and then
you can also like make them a bit
runnier
it's just they're really versatile and
they're super on-trend and I reach for
these all the times these are a big
staple in my wardrobe lock pants and
those and then awesome the summer like I
would get gratitude toward shorts but I
don't have a shirt off of me right now
that I do like shorts are always
disabling any the next thing which is
actually kind of surprising is a this
Harley Davidson vintage tees I don't
know why I love this T so much I
accidently like these are bleach stains
on it which was accidental I was like
bleaching something and I got all over
my shirt but I just love the way it
looks I love the material I love the way
it falls and I'm just like I just really
love to chew this with mom jeans this
with last hands like I just love and it
feels like
the comfiest t-shirt ever so anywhere
vintage begin be a band he this is a
hardly innocent people like it could be
a vanity because anything I just I think
this was just big staple I love the like
a little riff in it it's not distressed
but it is you know it's just such a
great t-shirt and I do
I like wear this all the time so six
people in the boardroom this is like a
classic and probably a staple of
anyone's wardrobe it's just a white
t-shirt this is an all same t-shirt
v-neck but not too low but not too high
it's not super fitted but not super
baggy
it's like grab a hole in it
 that's with resin and water and dry
shouldn't really like service on the
dryer but I knew anything white t-shirt
I think it's just like a staple I I love
white t-shirt white t-shirts and black
pants white t-shirts and mom jeans when
he should send any literally any pair of
jeans or pants or anything I think a
white t-shirt is like a staple and I
think that you can get I think I would
me personally I would spend this is
t-shirts like 90 bucks I would spend
more money on a really nice fitting
t-shirt because I do wear them all the
time I think that you can get good deals
on white t-shirts but I just aroused the
Mormon need a really good quality
well-made t-shirt that's going to last
me a long time than like having to
repurchase all the time so white t-shirt
draw something for the web so you can't
see this lipstick it's like crumbling in
the middle and online the next thing is
like one of my favorite pieces in my
collection of clothes I got it well I've
had like a few leather jackets over this
it's a leather jacket I've had a few
leather jackets over the years but never
one that fits perfectly I could wear a
sweater and I could wear it with tank
top and it was just like a beautiful fit
I have had gas leather jacket I've had
as are a leather jacket I've had
literally every brand that is like
inexpensive but I was like you know
wear a leather jacket all the time I
need to like spend a lot of money on one
that's like AI love so this is the OL
Seng spell fern leather jacket it's
about six hundred dollars Canadian I
actually bought this in the States but
it's around 85 95 Canadian and it's just
like like my favorite thing ever it's 50
FLE it's such nice leather I love the
way it's wearing like right here it's
just like a little bit like sticker it I
just I love the waist wearing it's going
to last me forever I'm hoping but it's
super well-made and I really love my All
Saints leather jacket I know some people
don't like All Saints but I just love
the solid rocket and it's sickly
beautifully integrating four other
high-quality leather jackets that you
don't if you want to go to all seems
like Siri has a really nice leather
jacket which I think you're also isn't
it
symbolizing advanced companies right now
but you know like every I just think
that you're going to buy leather jacket
like maybe just buy one that's a classic
fit so this is like a biker fit doesn't
have to be by surface but just a classic
fit and not like embellished or
embroidered because that's what's going
to go out of file with this classic
leather jacket isn't going to go as well
so I love it i revert always want to
just like wearing a low jacket on the
kids feeling so uncomfortable they go
around each other I'd rather look at me
thinking like I look so cool and I'm
like I am cool with my leather jacket
and the next call the item is kind of
surprising but is like my most worn
dress for sure
it is this Wilfred free trip button up
dress and it's not like structured it's
really flowy it is really sheer see if
we're like super nude underwear with it
but it's a wall please kind of like
wrinkly material dress hi-low hem you'll
see it on people lean up but it's also
my most worn dress I wear and you can
wear it to like an event
it looks really good they go long at his
long black with mandarin collar laser it
looks stunning with that a white blazer
it was really good with that looks it
was a leather jacket and then it also is
good like casually just by itself looks
good my like gray long Cody for I wore
it with flat boots I've worn it with
like sandals I've worn it with heeled
boots it's just like such a versatile
piece I'm going to actually style this
in that video that I was talking about
because it's so versatile multi
resistance exact ones available anymore
but I know that ERISA has similar ones
and I'm sure that you can find just
literally like a white button-down dress
the buns actually don't even go all the
way down but it's just like my most worn
dress and I don't even know when I
bought it like maybe a few years ago and
I just like I didn't even like balance
my first want it and now I like I love
it I love it and then oh my most worn
boots I would say this this season
custom these ones they're from Aldo last
year but they do have a similar pair
this year and they're just like a soft
bootie with an almond toe in this round
heel I think they're really comfortable
I love the way they look I really do
love all those shoes I think for the
price they last like a pretty long time
this one I just broke the heel I just
like you can see inside there right
right there is this white but I've worn
these like an insane amount of time
there were them out to the bar I welcome
to meetings I wear them like just during
the day casually they're super comfy I
love all the shoes and I think they're
only they're 180 maybe maybe 150 but I
love the soft MIDI because as I said
with those Janie jeans they're cropped
right so these go all the way up and
they cover my leg so that look looks
streamlined and then I can also tuck
these into a Nam Jin's are testimonies
and Steve they just are so versatile if
you like local I Instagram I wear these
all the time so these are amazing and
then lattes on my feet right now our van
either it's a heart also between bands
and hi pop converse but I think that I
wear is is more just because they're
like easier or not high-top but I do
love a good high top offers so just a
sneaker either vans or coppers I cannot
live without I just throw them on like
running errands or like looking like
whatever there's like a sneaker right
you can they're just anything so yeah
those are my eight pieces that I don't
think that I could survive without so
dramatic obviously with autism so they
are men want most warm pieces and they
are my favorite I am going to do that
video with styling them and I'm going to
give you I think I have written their 23
outfits but I have four staple pieces so
that white button-up dress long jeans
black pants and then shorts I'm going to
do those for staples I'm going to style
them in different ways so you can you
know get it inspired by your wardrobe so
