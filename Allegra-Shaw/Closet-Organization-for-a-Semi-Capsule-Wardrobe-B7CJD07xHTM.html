or a film once before and it turned out
really bad so I'm gonna try my best to
do it this time
um this is a pretty massive closet and
you levels don't have quads like this my
father my parents house was actually
really small so he looks pretty good
luxury for me and I have like throwing
out half my clothes so nothing out is
away but my wardrobe consists of a lot
of clothes everything I wear constantly
and I love so I'm going to run through
it here and then I'm also going to take
the character and kind of give you a
close-up I think so let's just get into
it people you can see all I just like
here I see directives and then it goes
into shirt everything's kind of
color-coordinated the like
color-coordinated by section so directed
our blazer stories and dresses and then
shirts blocked to white up here at each
impose up here at keep things that are
where too often like overall the season
hops up there and then below is where I
store my gym bag I also have shoe racks
I'm not sure if you can see it but I
will have footage of it so just toss it
there um these are all the dresses I own
I have some summer stuff under that
having gone through Nate you've gone
through it yet so I'm not sure so you
keep it but I do have some summer stuff
under my bed like dresses and stuff a
lot of it about here one that I better
like very very summery
and then here is where I think a little
bit more organized before but such as
life and so here I see some cheese and
some tanks that I wear a lot of
comparatives and some can use some
t-shirt
I see five pay tops and t-shirts here at
key territory tank tops and crop tops
here t-shirts and long sleeved here like
wash and like normal color jeans black
jeans which I have a lot of the like you
know black gray let their pants stuff
like that and then I keep all my
underwear there in these little things
up here what can't sweat shirts and then
I have one over here that you can't see
it the head like t-shirts you know like
my sorority t-shirts some more bands to
use things I don't wear that often that
I don't really want to do away because I
have memories and stuff and like a
t-shirt not let me keep all their
sweaters here so in the summer this is
when I will switch out substitute my
sweaters I'll put them in umberto so I
don't believe we'll come all the time
but again kind of color-coordinated a
little bit as in Canada so it's kind of
cool to love sweaters so then you can go
goes into here so my white sweaters here
Tasha ornaments Jeremy over love then
this is again my t-shirts are cut
begging to go in here questions go there
and then here I can longer to like this
long cardigan so good even if you also
see myself there ahh bras needs to be a
little uh not so messy I keep my pajamas
and we sleep stuff here just so short um
here you shorts it all year round you
got and I don't know a lot of eggs so I
just eat an egg right here this is like
such and where its heat bellies we're
off drops and like maybe like stalking
stuff like that and then I see my soft
down here and then again shoes are lined
up on bottom so that's
that's my whole entire wardrobe pretty
pretty organized which are seated
organized containerized organized and
you just find stuff again with summer
stuff was in my bed and I will switch it
out and seasons change but other than
that that's my wardrobe I hope you guys
