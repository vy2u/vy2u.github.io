date nights
outfits lookbook first outfit is a
little more dressed up I'm wearing a
body suit from gooseberry intimates a
little bit too big for me and I had to
put navel pads underneath because it is
see-through but it's very chic and you
could definitely wear this out if you
covered up the nipples or let them free
whatever you want these suit pants are
from a ritzy ax and they're white and I
think you could definitely put a white
blazer over this as well choose our Aldo
and my bag is super old from H&amp;amp;M I love
this outfit it's dressed up it's sexy
but it's still chic the second outfit
here is my favorite new tunic I just
wanted to show you another way that you
could wear this tunic if you see my
outfit of the week video I styled it two
ways and this is a third way so just
belting it I double belted it I should
have pulled out the top of it I just
didn't have a mirror when I was filming
Co and then I put it with boots so it's
a bit more grungy casual and easy to
throw a black coat over that and to be
pretty much perfect for any occasion I
also wanted to style it with a pair of
flats this now that I'm looking at it
does kind of look like a pajama set but
I think if you lived in a hot climate
it'd be perfect these are just some
little mules that are also just a bit
too big for me but I can make them work
I love the blue color and I think this
is just a really casual easy outfit I
really like it what do you guys think I
know it can look a little pajama but I'm
kind of into it it's sexy but it's
covered up and I don't know gives me
good vibes the next outfit here is one
of my favorites super classic and casual
but dressed up because there is heels
you could also pair this with flats if
that makes you feel more comfortable but
it's just a pair of nice flattering
light wash high-waisted jeans belted
with a button-down pattern shirt you
could also go the route of having like a
red pattern shirt you could just do a
solid if you wanted
this is the apana shirt that I have in
my wardrobe and really like this I
paired it with a nude clutch and black
heels and I just feel really comfortable
in this outfit but I feel sexy
this again is a casual but put together
outfit
excuse my shirt it was a little bit wet
and I threw it in the bag and it got
very wrinkly you're gonna see it's a
very very wrinkly shirt but it's just
jeans and a t-shirt this outfits my
favorite light wash jeans belted with an
oversized uncle Studios t-shirt with the
pink blazer to give it that Valentine's
Day feel and pink is really in this
season I'm loving that and then I wore
the same flats you could also easily
pair this with white boots black boots
you can pair it with heels you pair nude
heels black heels it kind of just goes
everything and this is again just a
really casual outfit but it looks put
together it looks chic and I feel really
confident and good in this outfit I just
realized I keep telling you how these
outfits make me feel but this outfit
videos for you guys and about you guys
and giving you guys inspiration whatever
these are just how these outfits make me
feel maybe they'll make you feel the
same this is also a really great outfit
super easy I wore an outfit like this a
couple valentines days ago but for this
outfit I paired a biker leather skirt
with a classic camel crewneck cashmere
sweater I debated putting this with a
red sweater but I want to show you that
you didn't have to wear red or pink on
Valentine's Day so I thought this was a
great option it's very neutral I wore it
with some flat boots but you could
easily wear this with heeled booties or
even higher up like mid calf booties I
think that would look really nice here
what with heels you can kind of wear it
with ever you want but this is just
probably what I would wear it with and I
would pair some necklaces and then I
would just put a coat on top yeah thank
