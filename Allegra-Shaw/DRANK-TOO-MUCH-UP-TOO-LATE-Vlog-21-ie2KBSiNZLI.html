just go home from New York yesterday um
I'm so tired like I have tired voice and
it is like in the afternoon still and
basically I'm like having withdrawals
from New York so so fun but I have to do
so many things today and I'm just like
dying so after like refilm videos most
like not happy with how it turned out
and I have to I'm gonna go get food
right now so that I can just like stay
in my apartment work all day but I was I
put just like some tinted moisturizer on
but it's actually looking into getting
cold laser therapy for my face I
actually I got not like a recommendation
but um one of the the Canadian wife on
hockey wives she saw her Instagram and
she suffers from auto acne and then had
I don't acne scarring and said that cold
laser therapy really helped her so she
had this like found this place in LA I
don't never go to LA so I'm looking for
some places in Toronto to do that and
hopefully it takes away my acne scarring
I broke out like crazy because like I
was in New York for five days and like
didn't sleep and wasn't very nice to my
body so I broke out but it'll go away
and I feel the video I have to edit some
stuff to edit the governor balls MIDI
Governors of the haul video which
Governors Ball is like the best
experience ever like a highly recommend
going it was amazing yeah it was like so
incredible so I had Wilbur
I don't know I said that yeah I had when
got tacos had the mushroom tacos and
avocado tacos all cada one was alright
even though I heard it was amazing I
maybe I just don't really like like a
huge piece of avocado would have liked
if it was like more chopped up but the
mushroom ones were really really good
I'm just gonna put on some makeup and
then fill in video I'm really pissed
though because I ordered a vlogging
camera for before New York
I already sony a 5100 a 5100 yeah and it
didn't come in time but yeah I also got
some juice this is the deeper one I
drank the other one so I'm gonna put on
some makeup but I'm gonna film this
video I'm not this is my bag from New
York Silvan unpacked not gonna unpack my
makeup because I don't like unpacking I
literally like had never had allergies
in my life and I have allergies now I
think like I don't I don't even
understand right now I am actually just
changing my Twitter picture because I'm
like so sick about one ugly one that I
use oh God
I'm like dying it's about ten and when
Starbucks I got coffee because I've just
had been not feeling drinking hot coffee
lately
not sure why well it's summer so that's
probably why I'm also just editing the
golf-ball video and another video that's
gonna go live next week and then I'm
just gonna plan out the videos that okay
I don't know how to change my Twitter
picture I'm just gonna plan out the
videos that are gonna go up in between
those two videos so next Tuesday and oh
no no no this videos so next Friday
right yeah oh yeah I already have it
planned out but there's someone that I
want to do uh have some other works do
have a report to do just so weird I
never do reports oh well you know it's
crazy I forgot to tell you guys when we
were in New York we were we sit at the
Ace Hotel which was like such a nice
hotel really hit the bar like everyone
were just like hanging on the lounge and
like do work it was kind of weird but
super nice hotel but when we were
leaving Skrillex was coming in like we
had our bags wig for a cap and he was
like getting out of a manoeuvre and yeah
it was pretty epic
we saw Skrillex we also saw Jonah Hill
walking his dog with another comedian I
don't know his name but just walking his
dog and so well also I look really tan
right
holy loving tan is amazing amazing
best self tanner ever used so right now
I'm planning out like a what I eat in a
day sort of video and as some of you may
know I you know I was like sort of vegan
really I don't know I'm just like trying
to be fully vegan I will never be fully
vegan because my family will never make
me another meal at Lake holidays so on
those holidays I will have to eat meat
because my family does give a about
your eating preferences anyway when I I
eat mostly vegan during the week and
stuff so I have been watching hot for
food they're part of actually kin
community which is my network as well
and like I knew about them but I had
never watched like their videos and I am
I'm obsessed
like they are amazing they have
everything that I love to eat
excited to because I think the hard
thing about going vegan is like what am
I gonna make I mean like it's expensive
and you need to have like a lot of
different ingredients and I need to go
grocery shopping but it's nice to be
able to like look at their recipes and
kind of like plan out maybe a few meals
that you're gonna want to make this week
and then you couldn't like write down
the ingredients and you know what to buy
at the grocery store because it's kind
of difficult to like going to the
grocery store just like boch it when you
don't really know what you're gonna make
and I know that mom is always like have
meals play-doh for the week but like
when you're by yourself here's like oh
 it I'll just eat out so I just
wrote down everything that I'm in need
and and then I can film a video that day
that I make these recipes but there's so
many good recipes I highly highly
recommend to their channel if you eat
I just bought Kanye West tickets for
Toronto so excited
August 30th they were pretty expensive
but worth it because we didn't get to
see Michael Ball I'm actually just in
the middle of all I just finished
filming this breakfast that I just ate
I'm in the middle of what I eat in a day
because lately I've been very hungry and
I thought I'd film what I eat a day when
I'm very hungry so that people are gonna
be for not eating enough like
yesterday I was starving all day so I'm
gonna do what I eat in a day but I think
I'm gonna go I think I'm a way out for
dinner tonight so I'll just film a
dinner another night if you know what I
mean like I'll eat what I even if I go
out I'll film a meal that I make the
next day so like a true what I in a day
but I'm not gonna film like a restaurant
I don't go out for dinner enough so I'd
rather do something that like is
actually real I don't know if that even
made sense cuz someone texted me and I
was reading my text well he's trying to
explain but if you understand you got it
it's like an average what ie today
instead of like this is what I ate this
day you know what I mean yeah anyway
yeah thought I'd share that I was so
productive I'm in a row now because put
self tanner on and I hang up my robe so
productive today almost on the would I
eat in a day video well not almost done
I did lunch
need to do snack later but hungry right
now
I just watched all my vlogmas videos and
actually I'm pretty excited for vlogmas
I don't so far away but yeah I need to
shower soon
so bad at vlogging um so I guess I'll
just continue whatever Clips I had
before in the other clip I was like with
most Merck and she had like that meet up
and stuff that I went to and now I'm
just printing out some stuff to ship in
order we got some cool things if you saw
my Gladrags lookbook the give me
t-shirts and then give me coffee shirts
and the Toronto sweater and the please
don't make this harder sweater really
great stuff and just like keeping adding
to the inventory so doing that right now
and then I have to add a Canadian Tire
to pick up some bins because it's just
all inventories just like overflowing
and I need some stuff to make it not
overflow and then yeah I'm gonna meet
with shre in we're going to this cool
backyard party thing tonight so I will

be better at vlogging but I need to blog

you know my vlogs are so boring cuz
they're not like cohesive you know what
I mean I don't know what to do I don't
know if I should even put this one up
like I'll probably put it up but there's
not cohesive and like I feel like it's
just me talking I don't know maybe I'm
just like not a good of water like tell
me want to see in vlogs like do you like
when I talk to camera or do you want to
see like what a meeting all of those I
watch people are just like talking to

tonight I'm not sure I have to put this
vlog up for you guys
so I just wow dark in here
just got home from getting some tacos I
went to Wilbur I'm not obsessed with
what we're like I really love tacos but
well we're just so close to my house
it's so fast and so cheap that it's just
like the easiest food teen it's like
good portions for me you know like three
old tacos and it's good for me so I'm
