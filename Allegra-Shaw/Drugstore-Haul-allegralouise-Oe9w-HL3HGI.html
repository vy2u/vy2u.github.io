drugstore haul um I don't think ever
done one of these before
so um oh and Rea my lips should I put
something on let's do it
well that doesn't look very good so um
for warning if you hear some loud noise
in the background the air show is this
weekend so I look really close to the
water and the fighter planes are going
over my building and it's very loud
okay so drugstore haul um I went to the
drugstore I bought some things I want to
show you but I also a sense of things
that you can get the drugstore so I want
to show you those as well I'm a water
like press samples in the mail I think
it's the cold 8 Pierce ampuls so I want
to show you some things that I actually
really like okay first thing is where is
it oh I got a little Oreo too much
foundation and three I use em for in the
summer but it is now September 2nd so
we're going into fall and I'm going to
lose the tan and yeah I thought that
this was I don't know I had I actually
haven't opened it or tried it but I feel
like it been for works on 3 will work so
god I really like this foundation it is
kind of these methods like 20 bucks
which is kind of expensive for a
drugstore foundation but it only lasts
like super a long time and it's a really
great drugstore foundation this is like
probably my favorite drugstore
foundation and yeah so that second thing
is I talked with these boys OB tampons
these my favorite tampons ever they are
open it up they're so tiny they look
like this there's no applicator so that
makes them super eco-friendly which is
great they're super comfortable because
you can just like you can like fit it to
your body it comes in a regular super
and super plush so the normal and
these with regular ones just ease it
through on your bag easy to throw in
your pocket
My Hair Salons I've been using these for
years Amy going to your own box for free
click the link in the description and
fill out your information from your own
box for free while supplies last I'm
pretty sure that's still going on yeah I
got my box for you want you to get your
box for free
duh okay let's what's the next thing
okay I got these lip liners I really
like the mix lip liners these are NYX
lip liners uh and I got the one in
natural I just don't have it on me right
now so I bought the one in natural I
really liked it love to the colors and
then I'm like hey I'm gonna go buy some
new ones and like when I go to the
drugstore I usually pick colors that
like I've seen or heard on YouTube so I
couldn't remember any of the colors I
had seen on YouTube so I got this one
nectar cuz I just felt like I heard
about it before yeah it's not great it's
like shiny it's like a nice color but
it's like shiny and I don't really wear
shiny lip products so I never like that
but I mean maybe it'll look like a matte
lipstick over top and then I got this
one in pinky beige thinking that like
it'd be really great I'm wearing on my
lips right now I was you saw in the
beginning clip and it's just like too
pale it's just too much of a pale pink I
don't know if you can see those so not
really impressed feet I love the formula
of them I think they're like really
great they stay on they do the job
they're waterproof but I just picked
like stupid colors but I really like the
color natural so if you're looking for
like a natural lip liner I really like
that color if you have any
recommendations for colors I would pick
them up because I like these lip liners
so give me some recommendations for
those the next thing are these lipsticks
going these lip products or don't even
these were I was set up the whole Kate
where is it Rimmel Kate lipsticks and
these lipsticks are so good they're mine
they're hydrating Oh am I like super mad
but they're mad they're hydrating and
they last like quite a long time for
just like a normal lipstick so the
colors I've been loving are 45 which is
just like a neutral sort of shade like
really easy to wear I think it might be
too overexposed but it's just really
easy to wear looks like that it's really
nice that's 45 and 41 which is just a
little bit later same sort of tone these
actually really good together if you
want to get like kind of ombre look so
they look really good together they both
really look good about NYX lip liner and
then the color that I think I'm gonna be
loving is 30 which is like a dark purple
and it really is reminiscent of Mac
rebel like very similar so been loving
these I love the formula and I think
they're pretty inexpensive for lipsticks
which is nice
I think the lighting so those are all my
colors all like super natural but I
really love this little family of colors
I think maybe the mat on top of the
doctor might actually look really good I
guess we're going let's just finish the
lip product so actually use these yet
these were sent to me in like a balloon
with sparkles in them this burgers are
right here I'm gonna pop the balloon of
a storybook one everywhere
but they're us lip balms but they have
like an iridescent shimmer to them I I
don't know I don't know how I feel that
EOS lip balms I think that they've
actually make your lips more dry like I
feel like I have like acid in it which I
know is like a thing
make sure looks more dry so you can
become like addicted to them but I just
made that up I have no idea I thought I
should case so I don't know I haven't
used these but these look really pretty
this one's like a pink one and I have a
clear one like you can't see it but it's
like this shine so just going on now
you smell really nice landing like the
same because the lights going in and out
but these look really cool they look
shiny and cool and they smell really
good really not impressed with the
sparkle situation that's all over my
apartment
that's all get over it after lighting is
hard to work with let me tell you I got
this Marc Anthony hydrating coconut oil
shampoo it smells really good
he says sulfate free infuse biotin I
just needed a new shampoo and I honestly
didn't know what to get so I got this
one if you guys have used this before
let me know what you think
smells like coconuts and the next thing
I was something whole selling hansen
argan oil spring collection nail
polishes and I love Sally Hansen nail
polishes I think they're really great
which is the gel ones so I gave these a
try I'm actually my nails are like
really they're all falling don't falling
off like I ripped off the shellac that
wasn't me so I'd slap on painted over
them and I really like the formula it
was super easy to go on like super
opaque so this is the color chai on life
and it really likes this color but
there's tons of nudes like nudes for
every skin tone there's like fun colors
there is like some sparkly ones whenever
I don't really wear those I usually go
for like a nude black or white but
they're tons of colors and I like the
argan oil formula I think it was really
nice like I care only seen it like these
nails look really good and then see with
the top coat I really like the top coat
so I want to show that just like argan
oil formula it's really cool I'm always
looking for a good top coat you know it
wasn't like super shiny but it it was
good I liked it and then what I've been
actually loving is the argan oil color
therapy nail and cuticle oil it smells
phenomenal I just keep this on my bed
and I just there's a tiny little brush
on it and I just put it on my cuticles
like whenever I remember and just smells
good and moisturizes your cuticles so I
then
not a lot how to recommend that I picked
up some tweezers tweezers are so
expensive like what um my kids just like
had them for a really long time and they
like work clothes and probably getting
the hair so I went to go buy the
tweezers and I'm like holy these
are $20 for tweezers so I decided to get
this little 2-pack because this was like
10 bucks and I came with two and like
who cares they're mini so it has like
the flattop one and the pointy one cause
I wanted to get both and they used them
and they're really good so crazy how
says the tweezers are but I just got
this little pack and it comes a little
case which is cute to keep them together
I picked up an eyelash curler this is
the quo eyelash curler it's black I just
like don't know where mine is
so I just have any one I really don't
really curl my lashes but I feel like I
only can curl them because I can't pull
out this roller don't know how good this
one is so I can't attest it out but I
hit all my left killers are the same
like all the metal ones the same yeah
that was like black I don't know
whatever I picked up some metal hush
very exciting that the Sensodyne medical
watch was I want to have both wash what
like I don't want to brush my teeth and
I want to have fresh breath and you some
time to pee so I got somethin uh wash
and does that it oh we're done okay that
was it
