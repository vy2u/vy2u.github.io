hey guys what's up if you're new here
I'm Allegra subscribe if you want I make
fashion and lifestyle content I think
that's what we're calling it now so this
video is a booty workout it's an easy
workout that you could just do in your
home you don't need equipment I use
booty bands and ankle weights which will
be linked down below if you want to buy
those but easy easy workout to do
basically anywhere so click the bell be
notified so you don't miss out
I also have an AB video which will be
linked down below I have a full fitness
playlist if you're looking for other
parts of the body so let's just let's
just get into video just recorded this
whole voiceover in it didn't work so
that's great ok so the first episode
what the first exercise is a squat with
a kick you can do this with the
resistance band with the ankle weights
like me or you can just do with your
bodyweight whatever you want
basically just squat down and kick to
the side I do about 15 to 20 each leg
and it's a great warm-up workout kinda
gets your heart going it's also pretty
challenging
the next exercise is a side step or side
shuffle harder than it looks you just
squat down and shuffle from side to side
you can do this as many times as you
want I usually do about five each way
four times or something along those
lines
great exercise keep your bum down I kept
coming up keep your bum really down you
want to be as low as you can go next a
little butterfly pulse action so you
just squat down and butterfly your legs
really works your outer glute area like
this exercise the next one is a kickback
standing kickback at the beginning my
leg goes straight my supporting leg but
I eventually drop down and you know
bent it to make it a better supporting
leg if this is too hard for you use a
wall don't struggle but the keeping off
balance will make the exercise harder
but don't feel like you need to do it
like this you can always hold a wall if
your balance is off
and now we're on the floor so now we're
in the glute bridge section first I'm
doing a bridge with my feet together
this will really work your hamstrings
it's a definitely hamstring focused
exercise and then the next exercise is a
glute bridge variation so just one leg
on the ground and then the other foot
the heel is in the air and the toe is on
the ground I got this variation off the
project summer body by Bailey on YouTube
and I really liked it it really really
burns and it's way harder than it looks
so I do about 15 to 20 of these in each
leg
to end it off I just do a classic
pollute bridge digging my heels into the
ground and squeezing my glutes together
and you could also do a little pulse at
the end if you wanted to make it harder
the clam digger definitely one of the
awkwarder moves in the bunch to do at
the gym resistance band will make it
harder you don't have to do with a
resistance band but just opening and
closing your legs really works the outer
glutes
I think Tosh and dev do this move a lot
and you know like who doesn't want a
body like Tosh and dev sexy I just
called them Tosh in dev as if like
they're my friends
- Oakley and effenberg medicine I meant
and the next exercise is a classic
donkey kick had to add these into the
bunch I always like to end off my
workout with these keep your back
straight and I'm doing this with a
resistance band as well but you don't
have to I also really like the straight
leg variation where you just keep your
leg straight I think those work really
well sometimes I'll switch it up and do
both sometimes I'll switch it up and
just do the straight leg but for this
video I did the donkey kick and then I
will do a fire hydrant again a classic
move before making the booty rounder
around the outside keep your back
straight keep your movements controlled
and work that booty
