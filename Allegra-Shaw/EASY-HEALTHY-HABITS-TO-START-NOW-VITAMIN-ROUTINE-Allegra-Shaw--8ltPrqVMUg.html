today's video is going to be a vitamin
routine as well as things that you can
start doing right now to live a
healthier well balanced lifestyle I did
one of these before and you guys seem to
like it
um so I thought I would do it again
different tips and add my vitamins in
let's just preface this video by saying
I am NOT a doctor I am NOT a
nutritionist Trisha nourished I'm not a
nutritionist and I'm not a dietitian so
you need to consult with whoever you
need to consult with before taking
vitamins before doing anything
health-related you need to listen to
your own body my what works for my body
is not gonna work for your body and I
would highly suggest you consult a
doctor natural path nutritionist
anything before you know taking vitamins
and supplements and all that stuff the
first tip is drink a glass of water
before every meal for two reasons a lot
of the times you think when you think
you're really hungry you're really just
really thirsty and I saw this before so
that's a great way to quench that thirst
get that water and take in and then also
there's some studies that say that
drinking a glass of water before meal
will help you consume less calories in
that meal and it'll also help you not
overeat number two I know we all lead
very busy lives so sometimes it can be
hard to eat you know healthy the whole
day but what I like to do is I know I'm
gonna be running around or I know that
it might be hard to get like super
healthy meals in I like to have one
healthy meal a day so I can feel really
really good about that meal whether it
be like I was running around all day and
I you know didn't have time to eat like
a proper breakfast and a healthy lunch I
like to really have a nice healthy
nutritious dinner the or I know that the
rest it is we had a guy do that for
breakfast or you know if I have that
time in the middle whatever I like to
have that one really nutritious healthy
meal and I feel like that will help you
get on track and it's just a good way
you don't have to feel so you don't feel
like guilt you know number three a big
one for me have healthy snacks around if
I don't have healthy snacks around
 so having healthy options to just
grab very key even pre making things
I've I found that really key so I'm
hungry during a day and I don't have
time to cook or I just need something to
grab and go it's there it's ready and
it's super healthy number four I know
it's gonna be a hard one for a lot of
people don't eat until you wanna die in
a food coma eat until it when you start
feeling not like a little bit of
fullness stop I'm pretty good at this
I've always been good at this my family
not so good at this they eat until they
literally cannot even get off the floor
so eating when you feel full you just
stop and a great way to do this is to
eat slowly because your body can then
kind of figure out when it's full number
five
super super important for every
individual listen to your body listen to
what your body means and what works for
you because what works for someone else
is not gonna work for you get in touch
with your body build a relationship with
your body listen to it give it what it
needs and do you totally forgot to film
this tip number six tidy up sometimes
when I when my apartments a mess and I
feel really unorganized and disorganized
I don't want to cook and I don't really
want to take care of myself because I
just feel like messy so tidy up take
care of like your surroundings and
you'll just feel better works for me
when I'm clean and my apartments clean
in my bedrooms clean and I feel
organized I make better choices number
seven do physical activity you enjoy
I've said this before but this has just
really come into fruition into my life
in the last about month I have been
hating going to the gym I don't want to
go I hate the gym I go to I just really
dislike the experience so I started
working on at home and I loved it and I
feel sore the next day and I just I've
been loving it so because I don't like
one to the gym right now I workout at
home and then you know I'm sure I'll
I'll end up back in the gym but fine
physical activity you enjoy it doesn't
necessarily mean going to the gym
Annamarie my vitamins let's just
let's just get into the vitamin routine
okay so I've done a ton of a different
vitamins I don't take these every day
I'll go through the ones I take daily
and then I'll go through other ones but
I really try to listen to my body and
what my body needs and what it's feeling
that day please check with someone a
doctor to see what your low in or
whatever don't just kind of like off
what you think really like you need to
figure out what will work for you
so for daily intake the first two things
that I take on the daily that are super
important to my health and well-being
are things for my stomach I have a
sensitive stomach I have always had
stomach problems so digestive enzymes
and probiotics and that are really
important to me and my health your gut
health is very important so I almond
vitamins are from hum this is not
sponsored I just hum is just really easy
and convenient for me so that's where I
got my vitamins the first one that I
take daily is the gut instincts and
that's 25 bien organisms and ten strains
of probiotics so I really take this one
to help my digestion get my stomach in
check all of the hum nutrition vitamins
are kind of like tailored towards beauty
Spilhaus something beauty in it but I
take this one for my stomach and along
with that I take a digestive enzyme this
is the flatter me
it says supports flatter stomach and
healthy digestion again I take this for
the digestion aspects of it but it has
all of your digestive enzymes that
you'll need for the day so I take these
two for the stomach and then I have a
daily the daily cleanse helps clear your
skin and body from toxins so this has
some algae and some detox herbs and then
I take a base control with iron I am low
in iron very low in iron so this one I
get the ID they have this one without
iron as well whatever you need but this
has all the things that you need you
know a normal multivitamin I'm talking
about I usually take at Omega is daily
or just I ran out of them and I'm
waiting on a shipment so omegas are
super important that's what I take daily
all these other ones are kind of like
extra ones depends on how I'm feeling
another one that I take frequently is
the b12 turbo boosts your vitamin b12 I
don't eat a lot of b12 comes from dairy
and comes from me I don't eat a lot of
that so I don't get it enough of it into
my system so taking a b12 from me it
really helped it's good for your red
blood cells good for your metabolism
tons of great benefits to taking b12 and
just to let you know that all the hum
nutrition's are vegan friendly uber
energy this isn't one I take very often
this has dr. Jen's l-tyrosine b5 and b6
I take this one on days like today that
I'm very tired and I'm usually take it
in the morning or I could take it mid
dr. noon if I'm gonna you know I really
need to have a I need to have like a
very productive day and I'm kind of
fading out instead of having coffee I'll
take a vitamin and they'd help you with
you know combating that fatigue I don't
take again I don't take this daily but
this is a good diet I like to have on
hand because I have such a busy schedule
um skinny bird this is like a weight
loss program I really don't take this
one that often but it helps with stress
eating boosts metabolism the green tea
it helps curb appetite so I like to take
this one around dinner I really don't
take that often um but if you're having
you know trouble with overeating or
being hungry all the time this is a
great one to take I feel like I should
be sponsored by home for this video okay
and someone's for aesthetic this is
purely beauty related collagen so this
is a three capsule sort of collagen
thing collagen is great for wrinkles and
skin mostly for skin and preventing
wrinkles if I don't take a pill I have
these as well which are from vital
proteins and you can put them in water
or your smoothies I really like these
for collagen there's one that's
unsweetened or unflavored so I usually
put this one in my smoothies and then
this one is like a lavender lemon one
which is really delicious and I like to
put this in water so these are great for
collagen as well however I like to have
my collagen not today about
do it wine I like to take every day
because they're gummies and who doesn't
let him to eat some gummies when I first
started taking these I thought they were
disgusting is they're vegan gummies but
now I really like them so they're the
hare sweet hair for stronger healthier
hair I actually didn't buy these I got
them why I bought something I think they
came as like a free like sample we've
got a full-size free sample I really
like these I actually have seen a
difference in my hair and nails from
taking vitamins my nails are way
stronger they'd grow longer my hair is
healthier shinier it looks nicer so I
really like these this is biotin folic
acid folk tea b12 zinc and pollen and
ten different nutrients for your hair
and nails same kind of thing this is the
red carpet this is black currant seed
oil gamma I don't know
vitamin E there's a ton of different
things in here and this is for glowing
skin shiny hair again ascetics so I
don't I I really don't take these
depends on how many vitamins I'm taking
I try to limit how many supplements I'm
putting in my body at one time but I
have that one as well the last thing I
really like from hum is the raw Beauty
green superfood powder I add this in
with my scoop of protein in my morning
smoothie which a blog post will be
coming on my healthy morning smoothie
soon I really like the raw beauty and
it's a good addition to my healthy
smoothies that's it for vitamins another
healthy thing that I like to do is take
a shot of apple cider vinegar trust me I
don't do this every day but I just kind
of like I water it down just a little
bit I do a little shot at half maybe 3/4
apple cider vinegar and a little bit
water and I take a shot and it's so
disgusting but it's so good for you also
a great thing for your hair you can do
an apple cider vinegar rinse there's
just so many benefits to apple cider
vinegar I have a beauty hacks video
where I think I talked about them but
you can look them up just google them
that's it that's how those are my little
tips on how I stay healthy and things I
do every day to stay healthy and
maintain my figure and get me healthy on
the inside longer hair healthier nails
you know all that stuff I really I've
been liking this and none of these hurt
my stomach which is huge for me I can
take them I suggest you don't
one empty stomach I never do that
because your body does not like to take
a vitamin it's on an empty stomach so
make sure you're eating make sure you're
drinking enough water that's it thank
