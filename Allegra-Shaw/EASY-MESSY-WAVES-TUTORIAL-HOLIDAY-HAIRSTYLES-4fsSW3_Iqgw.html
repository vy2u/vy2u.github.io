video I am finally doing my classic
hairstyles video you guys been asking
for it I'm doing these waves along with
my more natural wave I want to thank
Dyson for sponsoring this video you
don't know how much I love a guy's
character I actually do because I've
talked about it many times they sent me
the new black and purple Dyson super
sonic which is so sleek and pretty uh I
go from here I thought this video would
be perfect for around the holidays
because this hairstyle is great for when
you have events and then my casual waves
is just like good for those family kind
of holiday things they don't have to
like look super good they still why are
hearing to be nice I definitely wear the
casual waves more often but I love this
from one I want my hair to look really
pretty and these are like my no fail
waves this hairdryer has literally
changed the game it is so light like
it's just crazy the hairdryer obviously
comes with it then you have two little
nozzles the styling concentrator and the
smoothing tool comes the diffuser which
we'll be using and then it also just
like extra bonus comes to this little
heat mat which is like just so nice it
comes with this little thing that you
put in and helps you like hang the
hairdryer like thanks Dyson for thinking
about me and where I'm going to store my
hairdryer very sweet of you okay so I
just wanna talk about this hairdryer a
little bit because I want to tell you
why this is the best hairdryer I've ever
used
so this hairdryer has intelligent heat
control so anything over a hundred and
fifty degrees is gonna burn and damage
your hair this hair dryer doesn't go
over that it goes only up to a hundred
if it doesn't go super hot how is it
gonna dry my hair it's actually the like
super fast airflow that will dry your
hair fast so instead of using a bunch of
heat to dry your hair it's gonna use
that powerful velocity of airflow also
something I really have to talk about
which my hair salon uses these now and
it's like game-changing for them it's so
light it's also super balanced so it
doesn't have that heavy back-end and
then non heavy front end so the motor is
actually in here which is nuts
so it's just really balanced and easy to
just kind of like flip around and the
girl who did my hair last time at my
salon was using this and she just like
it saves my arms let's just get right
into the looks so this hair look is my
we're glammed up hair I wear this when I
want like my herd I just know what's
gonna look good I get out of the shower
I put some people checked into and I put
some G's you in my hair to keep the ends
nice and clean and then I just go in
with this smoothing nozzle because I'm
super bad with the round brush so this
tool is great because it kind of takes
away this type of having used a round
brush you can just use your fingers and
you can blow-dry your hair smooth my
hair takes it all the friends I love
that and I since I filmed me blow-drying
my hair
it took me under five minutes to dry my
hair which is in same 5 under 5 minutes
like my hair was completely dry so I
usually just point the nozzle facing
down to create the smoothest texture
possible but then in the Front's on top
of my hair I lift my bangs up and I
blow-dry them upwards to create more
volume and then I also flip my hair both
ways and blow-dry them both ways to
create that volume and I'm then easily
able to flip my hair both ways with my
hand throughout the day and it'll kind
of move with me when I'm trying to draw
my hair quickly I use the highest heat
setting as well as the highest power
setting and then when my hair is about
85% 90% dry I drop the heat setting down
one so I'm on the middle heat setting
and the highest power setting so after I
just blow-dry my hair it's all sleek and
smooth I hit it with a cold shot to keep
the style and and smooth out any frizz
and then I go in with a 1.5 inch curling
wand and I curl my hair and I just go
through these sections alternating
forwards and backwards I like doing
forwards and backwards because I just
think it creates a more natural look and
all the hair is not gonna fall the same
way and then as I get closer to the
front of my face that's when I start
just doing away from my face so I get
this nice like you know windswept
windblown sort of look when you're
curling your hair with your wand you
want to make sure that the barrel is
pointing down and your own you're
leaving about two inches out of the
bottom so you don't want to curl the
hair the whole way you want to leave a
good chunk of hair out to create more of
a wave and not so much a curl to the end
this is a crucial stuff in making the
waves look very natural and beachy
rather than a babydoll curl and then
this hairstyle is all about the products
that you use at the end so so first
put in a little more Gazoo to create
that shine I'm really into shiny hair
and it's just like a good product to
keep nourishing your hair with and then
I throw in my igk texture spray this
stuff is so key for me I don't use
hairspray or anything I just really want
this like nitty gritty texture in the
hair and I want the curls feel to fall
and move throughout the day so I don't
want them to be stiff so I spray this in
my hair and then I just scrunch up my
hair to create a very natural look you
can also do this with dry shampoo I just
prefer a texture spray in the end you
can nice frenched it with a little weigh
wave spray it again creates more texture
and then that's it you got this super
glam holiday hair from holiday to beyond
holiday this is the second look and it's
the casual more natural wave look the
way I get this look is I first put my
hair up into a bun out of the shower
this gets it out of my face and away
from my face while I'm do my makeup and
getting ready and then when I'm ready to
do my hair I let it down I put in my
veda be curly and some Gesu so then once
I put those products into my hair I get
into the diffuser so I take the diffuser
and I magnet it on to my hair dryer and
then I use the lowest power setting and
the lowest heat setting to create the
most natural wave look we really want to
try to replicate just being outside and
that sort of air dry effect try not to
take the diffuser from the bottom of
your hair and scrunch it up to your
scalp because it'll create kinks so just
try to lay your hair on top and go
through and then at the root you can
kind of massage it in so it creates more
texture at the top another great way to
use the diffuser is to flip your head
upside down you can get underneath where
I feel like it usually takes forever to
air dry you can really get in there and
dry and also create some nice volume
once your hair is completely dry that's
when you'll go in with some other
products I go in with the keys you again
because I haven't had a haircut in a
while so my hair's a little rowdy at the
bottom so some keys ooh I use the way
wave spray and they love using dry
shampoo as well you usually have dirty
hair saturation who's a lifesaver it
also has some great texture to your hair
if you need it then you end up with
these really natural easy waves and you
can just I like to flip my hair back and
forth
it looks just really easy and nice and
it's great for those days over the
holidays where you want to like look
nice but you don't want it look like
over glam or anything like that so great
holiday hairstyle but also a great
everyday
