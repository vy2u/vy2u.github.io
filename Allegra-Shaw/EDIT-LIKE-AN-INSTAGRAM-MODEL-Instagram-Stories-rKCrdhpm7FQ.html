video today and I just tried to sit on a
box and I fell through the ball so
that's how it's going right now but I'm
doing I um I am doing a having a heart
attack
what's going on okay anyway quick heart
attack in the middle of my video I am
doing a how am i Instagram theme you
guys know I changed my Instagram theme
like once a season so we kind of get
these videos once a season but like this
Instagram theme has been like highly
highly requested so I'm gonna show you
what I do also if you're new here I
don't know why youtuber say this if
you're new here I'm Alegre I make a lot
of cool videos Heather I come in and
check them out make a lot been making a
lot of vlogs and I feel like that's like
the way to get to know me there my vlogs
like that's where I kind of show you
more of my personalities so if you're
into that check those out I am so close
to hitting 600,000 subscribers I'm
freaking out so by the time this video
goes up I probably would have will have
hit it which is insane it's so crazy
that how many people have pressed
subscribe of course not all those people
watch my videos I can't believe that I'm
in Veloz seen at least one of my videos
and been like hey I want to subscribe be
creative so more people wanted to follow
with journey but what can I say that's
fucking amazing like 600,000 peoples I
can't even like wrap my head around it
and if I start talking about it I'm
probably gonna get emotional so 500,000
I did the Gucci giveaway for 600,000 I
think I might just do like a makeup sort
of thing or like a clothing thing I'm
not sure I actually didn't expect to hit
600,000 this quickly so I'm not prepared
so prepare so let's just get into the
incision part of the video I'm like sort
of freaking out right now I have my live
count going have 300 most people left my
feet is very like bright and clean and
sort of colorful I think I sort of
mastered what I want to do so if you
like kind of see down that's where I
started it started like really colorful
it's kind of using
kind of photos I wanted kind of oranjee
and then lately I've kind of moved in to
more like white and clean I haven't
changed the way of anything I've just
been changing the way I take photos to
kind of make it more that white
aesthetic but I'll just show you but I'm
taking photos right now I kind of look
for like clean white backgrounds or
things that just have a lot of white in
them so I'm kind of keep my feed looking
similar what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
edit three different types of photos -
on my phone and one on my computer so
for a normal photo I'm gonna do like a
iPhone quality photo a non iPhone
quality photo and then I'm gonna go into
a photo that like doesn't have the right
aesthetic to fit my feed and how I make
it my aesthetic okay so let's start off
with this photo this is a photo of me
drinking coffee at a diner
I have already gone in and whitened
anything that I think needs to be
whitened
so I whiten the plate and I whitened
dislike background in the mirror I have
done edit Instagram editing videos where
I show you how to whiten stuff it's
facetune I use the teeth whitening
two-lap they will be linked in the cards
if you want to check out how a white
fish use face tune so I'm not gonna do
that this videos it just takes up too
much time and then the filter I've been
using is c8 that's just what I've been
using I really like it it's in vsco cam
using this go cam to edit my photos and
yeah I've been using c8 and then
depending on the everything I do is
obviously - depending on the photo so
for this one okay I'll bring it down to
it like 8.2 because is doesn't really
need that much filter to it this is a
pretty dark photo so I bring up the
exposure quite a bit to around like 2.6
contrast I usually bring down just a tad
I always sharpen the photo session with
an iPhone photo photo it makes it look a
lot cleaner
saturation again really depends on the
photo I'm gonna bring the saturation up
like to on this one they're three again
this is a dark photo some bringing these
shadows up quite a bit to brighten up
the whole photo temperature now I
usually warm the photo and that's what
I've been doing I've been warming it but
since this one edited pretty warm I'm
gonna actually bring it down to like
three so that it kind of counteracts
skin tone I always bring down so it's
more pinky undertone and then I always
bring up the grain to bode you know 1.5
or two that's how I did at the photo
it's really simple a more professional
style photo I do the same sort of thing
but they're usually just easier to edit
so I put c8 on it kind of makes it it's
a little too much so I usually bring on
a professional style photo like sitting
like this on a professional style photo
and bring it down to what six and then
let's just play on this one I'm gonna
bring down the exposure because it was
already kind of expose a little bit the
contrast I'm still bringing down again
always sharpening the image just a tad
saturation I'm actually gonna bring the
saturation up one no you know what I'm
gonna actually bring the saturation down
to two minus two shadows I always bring
up just a tad and then the temperature
here since this is already a really cool
toned photo I'm gonna bring the
temperature up to like 0.5 skin tone
always bringing up skin tone down for
pinky undertones and then adding
Rane very simple and easy that's that's
all I do just that
super easy I don't spend too much time
editing photos and I obviously I use
plans the op plan so I can see my feed
and I just paid for like a better
version of it in this app I can just
kind of like plan my feet and make sure
it all like it's cohesive and nice to
get out for doing not know there's a ton
of different ones this one I paid for
but you can I switch from mosaic oh
because Isaiah Koh is just flinching and
whatever but I actually really do like
this one I like that you can like switch
them around and that the feed like
shifts when you add a photo so on my
computer I edit on Lightroom later you
do have to pay for Lightroom but you can
get the Lightroom app free on your phone
and you can download a ton of people
make mobile presets for Lightroom if
that's something you want to do okay so
here we are on Lightroom and I'm just
gonna imported the photo that I wanted
to edit so this thought it was great and
I really like it but I just it's not
white and bright it's just a different
aesthetic so I need to edit it a bit
differently so I bring it into Lightroom
and I actually bought a bunch of presets
from different youtubers instagramers I
have the JC Murray ones because I saw
this girl and it's with them and then I
really never use them as I don't like
them so I don't like those but I have
the gypsy lust presets I got those ones
and I really like them so I got got
their fashion preset pack and I've been
using them so for photo like this I use
preset number three preseason number
three just like brightens up the whites
in the photo and it really saves me a
lot of time and I'll do it myself
and then and I'm like that's it and then
I would airdrop the photo to my phone I
would bring it into vsco cam I would do
I would add the seed filter to it so
this is it edited with just the fashion
preset and then I would add the C 8
filter on top at
low-set like you know 3.5 and it doesn't
make like a huge difference but what it
does is it just makes sure that the
undertones of the photo match my feed
then I would put it into plan and make
sure that it all went together so that's
it that's all I do
literally all I do I'm gonna show you
some other things that I've been using
as well if you want to learn how to
remove people out of photos I have a
video about that if you want to learn
how to how I make myself look taller I
have a video about that so those will
all be linked in the cards and down
below i have an instagram like playlist
on my channel okay so these are all my
light are my photo editing apps so i use
vsco cam and facetune the most face
Gentoo is pretty crazy you can like
literally change your face like it's
insane
spring is the app that I use to make
myself appear taller if I had a bad
angle or I just kind of look like a
little stubby or something if something
myself look a bit taller down hand me
for that one just sometimes I just catch
a bad angle and you just look like
really short I'm like I not that short
in real life I'm actually like I'm five
six plan is my feed planning app after
light I was using a lot when I was doing
the vintage theme they have a lot of
great vintage filters I have a video I'm
not to light room but I've edited a
photo and you know something is just a
little off like if the green is just a
little too I really hate green and
photos I don't know why I just really do
if the green is just like a little too
much in my photo Lightroom you can
actually adjust the colors of or you can
adjust be like saturation hue and
luminance luminous luminous I was
specific colors so I like that for that
photo tanks where I keep rabbit photos
okay it was nothing in there I've had
that for literally years Skylab is a
Skylab is a like you can add sky into
the photo it's okay it's not great Kyra
Kyra you don't care Kyra's I don't know
where you've been
Fuji is like a disposable camera effect
it's cool I'll use it for stories
sometimes and then slide is really cool
you can
like take a photo and then they you do
like a little slide and it makes cool I
did that everyone stares I mean I did
that really poorly but and then what
I've been using for stories is this
called unfold so if you saw like my hair
Instagram story that's what I used I use
the unfold that's it it's so fast the
easy view guys have really been asking
for how to edit my Instagram photos so I
thought I would give it to you thank you
