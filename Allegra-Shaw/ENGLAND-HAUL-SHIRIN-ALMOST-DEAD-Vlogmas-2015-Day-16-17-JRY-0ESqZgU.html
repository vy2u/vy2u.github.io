that it's a human heart and it's
epic and I loved it it was like 130
pounds so that's really expensive for me

it looks pretty actually it looks like a
 bag on this but that's what I
got and then that's all I really got in
England shopping it's just like really
expensive to shop there because for
Canadian the conversion rate is just
double like everything is dope

like ten dollars um from Zara and like I
got like a turtleneck thing this is a
model focus yeah and and then I got that
dress and my necklace and that's all I
bought so it's pretty good I wanted to
say my money didn't want to spend too
much money
