get this glam up daytime glam daytime
glam makeup look I wear this one I have
events and like all that you know when I
have to be glam during the day I've been
really loving a bold lip lately so yeah
it's a chitchat kind of video I have a
lot of questions and answers your
questions that you asked me via
Instagram so if you're not on the
Instagram make sure you follow me there
and yeah thanks so much let's just let's
just start so I'm gonna do my makeup on
camera for you yeah because if you don't
follow me to Instagram I post it in
Instagram story asking if you wanted to
see a beauty video and it was an
overwhelming yes so we're gonna do it I
don't have any room it's all my prep
material no then by my bathroom and I
have no room so I'm using the glossy a
priming moisturizer I already have
moisturizer on my face and put it on a
few hours ago so I'm just putting a bit
of this priming moisturizer keep the
skin very hydrated my chin broke out if
you can see right broke out because I'm
going off birth control not because I
wanna have a baby cuz I've been on birth
control since I was like 14 for my
period I'm going all fit so my body is
kind of like getting used to it and also
had a facial and she said that like it
pulls all the stuff out so that's why
I'm breaking out it's like two things in
one but I'm sure it's just mostly the
birth control kind of my body adjusting
okay so I'm using the Dermalogica primer
hydro blue primer this has been a
favorite of mine for a while and like it
has a bit of not like pigment to it it's
white but it kind of like a mesh mesh to
your skin tone like can you just see the
difference on my chin there it's just
like way way less red which is great I'm
just gonna put it in some other areas
here where I have some pores probably is
done I got a spray tan the other day my
hands didn't really enjoy it I very dry
hands also might know
not came off but like you know peeled
off you see any like little dots on my
hands you know why okay so this is
makeup I wear when I have to feel like
glam during the day so if I like a
conference by a meeting I have an event
that kind of stuff this might not be
glam for you but for me it's glam I'm
using this Giorgio I have a spray tan
so I'm matching but I'm I'll show you
the stuff I use when I'm not and I'm
using the Giorgio Armani luminous cell
foundation and the six point five this
is like my summer color and then I've
been really loving as well
the Charlotte Tilbury magic foundation
in five medium love that one and then
for very light days when I'm not
breaking it like this
I used the cosmetics CC plus cream in
medium so I love those but today since I
have a tan on I am using the georgia
armani and i've been loving this brush i
think it's a body shop it's either a bra
body shop or a vanity vanity something
not i can't remember but i love this
brush i love the end of it I know it
cosmetics is a brush like this too
so um I'm just gonna put the product on
the brush and I like that it doesn't
make it like super full coverage I just
love it I love the way it puts the
product on everything I'll link
everything in down bar so I'm
considering doing vlogmas talk to this
one a lot cuz I think last year I said I
wasn't gonna do it this year but then
everytime blog must rolls around I like
just want to be involved so I think I'm
actually gonna do it again but what I'm
gonna do I would like to know started
putting a little bit more on my chin I
would like to know like what your ideal
vlog length is because like I see people
putting up like an hour-long vlog and
I'm like dude I don't have time to watch
this my ideal is like 10 to 15 minutes
but tell me what your ideal blog length
is and this will be like daily right so
probably not gonna have an hour of
footage for one day they
let me know about that you have so many
fun things going on in December we're
gonna I think you'll pop up in Toronto
from go because they have a bunch of new
stuff coming out and I know it's the
holidays and people don't want to like
buy things online so I think we're gonna
do that which is exciting we're just
kind of like finalizing I'm using the
Kat Von D walking concealer in neutral
one l15 neutral I think that will be
very exciting and then like somebody's
just like a fun month like I love the
holidays joy and I talked about going to
New York for a few days
okay there's hair in my face running out
of his concealer I do love this
concealer and then since I have a
breakout on my chin and you take some
concealer and put on my finger so I'm
not like putting the wand on some
bacteria and I'm just gonna I put up
this week I actually put up two videos
this week already because I forgot I
didn't have time to put up the video
last Friday so I put up a what I eat in
a day video which I love I love what I
eat in a day videos I'm gonna be doing
more of those and then I put up a how to
style a leather jacket that's probably
my most favorite video that I've ever
made I think it's just like the coolest
video ever the editing everything so you
haven't seen that how they recommend a
check that out because even if you don't
really like fashion videos that much
that I think sprit e cool not to like do
my own horn or anything would you guys
like to see like a more natural I just
feel like natural makeup is just like
everyone does it I think - well I think
everyone does glam makeup - I don't know
would you guys like to see a natural
warm natural makeup and now Jamaica is
just like make your face look nice and
then put mascara on actually gonna pull
up my phone and look at some questions
so umm someone asked me how I got into
modeling I don't model I'm five six too
short really to model I like was scouted
when I was in grade eight or something
very young when they were like hoping I
would grow and then
just never grew so yeah I don't know and
I'm using this Charlotte Tilbury contour
one mine exploded everywhere I just got
a bunch of Charlotte Tilbury products so
I don't contour my nose because look how
small my nose is why would I need to
contour my nose a lot of people also oh
sorry I take this sibling brush this is
the del M tools 9 5 5 and I just blend
everything out a lot of people ask me
questions about uncle so I'm going to
answer some now so uncle is my clothing
line clothing brand
we do like androgynous street wear
casual wear is what we like to call it
and I love your ask them that sizing so
we are in the middle of getting our
website to be to help you more with
sizing but we try to make everything as
true to size as possible so we try to
make my body type a small that's how we
kind of basis based our sizing because
I'm for sure not an extra small I'm for
sure a small and then we kind of size
great everything about it 1.5 inches our
sizing so I usually fit a small in all
sizes but I can wear like a t-shirt I
can wear an extra small it's just really
tight on me not really tight but tight
I'm now going to use the whole outer I
feel very calm this morning it's nice
it's a nice feeling how they they
meditated yep I feel very calm which is
nice so I'm taking the router and I
think is a light medium with the glossy
brush and I just focused this really in
the middle of my face and then I take
some more and I go over the eyes just
blend it any creasing my eyes tend to
crease a lot
I love the router I really do what an
amazing product if you want to try to
cat 1d powder I heard that's amazing as
well yeah we ship worldwide and you know
highly recommend you check
they're looking for really great basics
what do I need I'm gonna actually use
the same brush and then should it go
over the bronzer with Charlotte Tilbury
do face sculpt and blush I'm just taking
this and I'm just going to go over that
contour just lightly the spray tan wants
me looking pretty tanned already now I'm
gonna go into eyes I'm using again the
Charlotte Tilbury instant eye palette
but this one's special because this one
has my name on it but holy has my
name on it so amazing okay so I'm gonna
do the hair looks a little bit greasy
and you know what that's because it is
so I'm gonna use the desk eye that's
just something I like I like those
colors especially for fall I'm using the
shimmery color and I'm gonna use my
finger because I feel like it picks up
the sparkle the best I'm putting that on
the lip just gives are really pretty
like Sheen and this is the makeup i'm
wearing in these instagrams which
everyone's been asking about so that's
why I thought I would do this look my
favorite look right now though it has to
be like a pretty neutral eye with a bold
lip I just love I never like I don't
like wearing lipstick because I feel
like my lips like don't don't enjoy it
but I like the way it looks I like the
way it makes my face look okay so I rock
that up into the crease a little bit too
not on purpose
taking a fluffy brush I'm gonna use the
brown color in the palette the like
burnt kind of brown color and I'm really
focusing on I want my eyes to look more
long and not so big it's just what I've
been preferring lately so I'm doing this
very lightly in the crease but I'm
really gonna focus on like elongate in
the eye just pulling it out these are
pretty pigmented so I really like to
start light and build them up I remember
learning windshield wiper motion on
YouTube remember that was like whoa we
should wait promotion I'm gonna just
clean up things everything with my
finger so just love
this look and then I'm taking the darker
color it's just like a dark brown and
I'm gonna focus this right on the outer
corner feel free to not use the same
brush but I the only one that I had my
bag and also I'm just being realistic I
usually don't switch up my brushes that
much when I'm in a rush I'm gonna answer
a few questions before I do my eyeliner
what's the key to my confidence I just
kind of don't care what anyone else
thinks like I do
I don't sing like things don't got to be
negative comments for sure it got to me
sometimes but it's just like I me and
you're you
and let's just if you don't like me
that's cool I don't care like not
everyone's in like me and not I was
never a person who like needed to be
liked by everyone so I just kind of
always had this like okay you get we get
and like sorry I'm just to love yourself
I guess that's the key loving yourself
and working on yourself and working on
your relationship with yourself that's
the key to confidence well I just
figured it out
so my asking my Gucci slides are
comfortable very comfortable did it take
a while to break them in not really yeah
they're really comfortable I wanted to
take two yet uncle up and running and
did you plan on starting any more
business in the future also I love you
in your style plenty to just connect and
uncle is just hitting so we start an
uncle at the same time they started
Gladrags we kind of just like didn't
really do anything with uncle and we
really focused on Gua Bragg's so uncle
is gonna be like really a year in
November ish end of November and so it
takes a while like I think Gladrags is a
great learning experience for uncle and
kind of it takes a while that wasn't so
sure when you're starting from scratch
like you need to make mistakes you need
to learn the business you need to learn
the business in your city and and all
that so it takes like a I don't takes a
while and WestJet plans starting your
business in the future yeah I would love
to like have a product or something
maybe like a beauty product or I don't
know yeah I don't know yeah so I'm just
taking a Marhsall brown eyeliner and I'm
just gonna do a slight way
just a really natural sort of eyeliner
wing I don't know why this would be
natural because like who has an eyeliner
wing on they're not truly like that
let's answer another question
our knee-high boots still in how do you
style them for fall/winter not really a
knee-high boot person I think some
people pull them off really well but I
just personally really like ankle boots
I would probably wear like a knee-high
boots just like black pants but I'm
definitely more like an ankle ankle boot
person that's my biggest advice for
starting a YouTube channel consistency
be yourself good lighting what are some
foods you eat avoid to keep your skin
clear I avoid dairy that breaks me
out like no other and I just try to eat
like a balanced diet I feel like I don't
get a lot like I take vitamins to
supplement for the days that I don't eat
as well as I should try to eat a lot of
greens I try to eat just like a whole
balanced diet I cut out a lot of like
preservatives so when I'm cooking I try
to cook with like raw natural
ingredients and I don't cook with like
canned soup or like anything that has
like preservatives in and I tried and
not cook with so that when I eat like a
meal when I go out or like how fast food
I I kind of hadn't that balance that
makes sense I go to lip color is
Charlotte Tilbury pillow talk I love
that I love all the glossy eight wants
glossy cake and glossy like are really
good too I am halloween is coming up
halloween is this Friday
well it's next Tuesday but I'm going out
this Friday and Joey and I are being
Margot
oh so this video will go up the day I'm
going up probably and join her oh my god
- throws my costume Joe and I are being
Margot and Richie Tenenbaum from The
Royal Tenenbaums a good Wes Anderson
costume and then on the Saturday I think
Joey has to like go
for work so I think we might do
Jokke and JFK I'm gonna clean the eyes
up this is kind of a process well it's a
process when you can't like get really
close to the mirror so eyeliner is on
and I'm just going to tightline and for
mascara I'm gonna use the L'Oreal
telescopic you guys can use whatever
mascara you want and you can use soap
falsies if you want what are my favorite
products rocky scarring I actually sent
it a story asking for you guys for
suggestions and I got so many
suggestions I'm gonna try the ordinary
acne scarring stuff I have to go in this
week or next week but that's a lot of
people recommended the ordinary where is
my favorite place for a semi fancy
brunch in Toronto semi fancy I know Co
let's kind of like fancy well my
favorite but actually you know what
Colette is really good if you don't go
to the all-you-can-eat brunch I don't
like their all-you-can-eat brunch but
maybe you can't you do but I really like
their like Saturday brunch and it's kind
of fancy Oh someone just saw stated name
of this lipstick it'll be in the video
so I don't need to answer that question
where's my blush guys blush it's just
like this video she's gonna be like a
leg red digging through her makeup bag
so I'm using the Charlotte Tilbury
ecstasy looks like that just to brighten
up the face so just a little for
highlight I've been obsessed with glossy
halo scope in quartz and I just put it
on my ring finger and I put it all over
my face I just love it it's supernatural
not into heavy highlights anymore for a
while I wasn't even wearing a highlight
but I think this one doesn't look
shimmery and it just looks like glowy
it's just a bit down the bridge of the
nose brushing out my eyebrows you guys
know I don't do my eyebrows because what
do I need to do it's just another
product on my face which I don't need my
eyebrows are tick crazy I used to be so
insecure about my thick eyebrows and now
I'm like yeah
look at these brows I could maybe fill
in like a few patches but it's just not
worth it for me okay and now I'm gonna
use some setting spray I'm gonna use the
all-nighter so do I get the travel sized
ones I'm gonna let that sit and while it
sits one more question when you were a
university student to save money what
kind of clothing pieces would you
gravitate towards clothing stars okay I
was like a Shopaholic in university I I
don't know I was like blah I was like go
the bar like drink and I've come home
and like shop it was ridiculous and I
would buy like pretty cheap clothes and
in the end I would just like keep buying
clothes cuz those clothes were bad so I
just learned to buy nicer quality
clothes and have less because like I
would always like oh I didn't do it for
the bar they're like no one remembers
what you wore to the bar you know it's
fun to have it like a few piece of bar
pieces to go out in but like no one
knows no one remembers so I don't know
like just simple pieces like that's what
I always recommend to everyone like
basics are key to a wardrobe also
vintage stores amazing so cheap vintage
I mean Value Village staying motivated
to get off your ass when you live alone
I live in a studio by myself and if I
don't have a reason to get up I found
myself laying around doing nothing all
day this is by Olivia hi Olivia I feel
like we have a good relationship me and
Olivia
I don't really lay around
I find it hard button putting mascara no
find it really hard to do nothing
I just I'm always have to like I feel
like I always want to be productive I
don't know I've I've been working I got
into YouTube forever so I don't remember
the last time like I had nothing to do I
always have something to do but I think
a great thing if you feel like you have
nothing to do in the morning is go to
the gym first so you feel like first of
all make your bed big accomplish for the
day like get into bed make your bed
go to the gym or like go outside go get
a coffee like just leave your house come
back shower get ready for the day and
then like because you're ready you won't
feel like oh I'm gonna do nothing
all day I think getting outside getting
exercise and getting ready is a key part
to being motivated even when I'm at home
editing all day and I probably not going
to leave my house I get ready I don't
put makeup on but I shower I brush my
teeth I'll do my hair you know like I'll
go out in the morning and get a coffee
maybe something like that or I'll just
like go sit on my balcony but just like
having that morning routine even when
you don't have to leave is like key to
being motivated and I think getting a
workout in in the morning or getting
some sort of physical activity in the
morning will make you feel a lot less
like sluggish and lethargic and when I'm
doing my mascara fost look I pull my
eyelashes to the side I don't curl them
because I want them to be straight and I
like pull them so that my eyes look
really long and then I only put mascara
on the bottom corner my biggest fear
that's a great question I don't know my
biggest fear is drowning to be honest oh
I just remembered I had a dream about
drowning last night
yeah because fear is drowning my
favorite youtubers a question I get
asked a lot I really lately I love
Megan's blogs for like informative
workout videos I like Abby Pollak I
think she's like super scientific about
it and I really enjoy that
I like Lydia E millons vlogs um they're
long but I like them and I like I like
to watch people who are like very not
who aren't like me which i think is
weird but um I love my girl Elena Elena
honestly I don't know how to pronounce
your last name is it petrol or Packer
Ellie I don't know should have asked her
when I saw her but I really like her
videos I like her makeup videos I think
she does really beautiful makeup should
I just look at my subscription box
there's a lot of people that like I used
to really like that I just kind of don't
watch those much anymore but I go
through phases so though I like
Yvette's keys well I think they're
really good that's kind of it for me
right now I'm going through like a weird
YouTube phase so right now I'm going to
use the bite Beauty lip pencil in oh
seven six is the number it's orange it's
an orange lipstick this is a lip liner
imagine if this was a look what's my
best you know best advice for University
um have fun I think having fun is a key
part of university I think you're there
to study but you're also there to expand
your mind and have a social life
study hard always thought of University
is like my full-time job someone once
told me that the amount of work and I
was in history and like I wrote so many
essays but the amount of work that profs
give you is not you can't do it all like
there's no way that you are gonna be
able to do it all especially like
someone like me I'm a slow reader so
there is no way in hell that I was gonna
read all the pages that I needed to read
a really big part of university is being
able to skim pick out the main points
and understand the concept without
having to read every word so one
prioritizing your work but like what's
the most important thing that needs to
get done - what's the least important
and also skimming and writing down the
main points and the main arguments to
that point is like super important
especially in seminar classes where you
have like 500 pages to read for one
class like that's not gonna happen
next I'm going to put on the bite Beauty
a mousse bouche and puree
I think this is a super pretty color and
you can keep it like this if you'd like
but there are two other things that I
like to do just I like to put the color
by by TV the color maple this is also a
very pretty color by itself this just
makes it a little bit more deeper red
this color with marscapone a' is also
very nice and this color by itself is
beautiful and while my lips to be a bit
more matte I take a sheet of toilet
paper put over my lips I'm taking the
louder like this
a little bit more Matt see what I mean
and then leave in more extra okay I take
glossier cake because it's a brown color
and I put that on top I mean this stuff
really doesn't do anything but I like to
think it does this is a lot I go for
when I have to be pretty glam which is
not very often but okay so that's the
look I hope you guys enjoyed it thank
you guys so much for watching this very
long video I hope I can edit it down to
a reasonable time please let me know
what your favorite video and vlog
lengths are in the downbar because I
will help me kind of edit down videos
thank you and I love you all and these
love and follow me on Instagram
