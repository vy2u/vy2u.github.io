today I'm going to show you how to look
good in five minutes and I look good I
mean put some makeup on I'm sure you're
all beautiful without makeup but
sometimes we just want to put makeup on
to make ourselves feel better i right
now have some zits all over my face so
I'm definitely in the face of wear eye
makeup when I leave the house but I
don't want to you know spend an hour
putting on makeup every day so this is
what I do mostly every day let's just do
it
Oh also there's a giveaway at the end of
this video um so stay tuned for that
it's a massive giveaway so you'll want
to be involved the first thing that I do
I have like a crazy zit here and a
crazies it here from the weekend so I
thought this would kind of I liked doing
these makeup tutorials when I have zits
because feel perfect skin it's really
easy to do your makeup I don't know what
the fuck happened but Jesus okay so I'm
going to start with the Dermalogica
hydro Blair specifically in the areas
that I have said my skin is just I don't
really know what's going on I mean I'm
still getting off birth control so skin
is just having a little moment but it
was totally good before this weekend so
I think it was just the fact that I
didn't take care of my body this weekend
cuz I was working the whole weekend but
that's it right here is like a actual
crater so cool lately I've been liking
color correcting just because I'm able
to put less makeup on when I color
correct so it's gonna take a bit of the
green this is a essence one I just sent
this someone sent this to me so you need
whatever you have but just a bit of
green over the zits you cancel that out
and any redness that I have on my face
which is basically all over my face one
day I will have beautiful skin one day
and then I've been liking taking the
yellow this is a more liquidy one so it
comes
this little doe foot applicator and just
dabbing that near my eyes the yellow
corrects dark circles I'm also going to
be using a more peachy concealer to
correct dark circles I feel like when
you only have five minutes to do your
makeup you're either like you know
really tired or you just really messed
up and you are just sitting in a robe on
your bed scrolling your Instagram for
too long after the shower which is
probably the case
sorry month and then the pink is really
great for brightening so I also just add
that a bit under here to brighten up
that area how does it here to Jesus not
good kind of just brightening up we're
at one of Braden up we're not any
Charlotte Tilbury Wonder glow I always
find myself kind of going towards this
in the wintertime I feel like it gives a
really beautiful soft golden glow to the
face and yeah I just I really really
love this product I think it's a great
base for under makeup I've had it for a
pretty long time I've this was probably
the first Charlotte Tilbury product that
I ever bought so no I really liked it
for foundation I like Jesus CC cream a
lot at the time if I'm running late it's
just really easily blendable but I
really really love the Tarte stick
foundation clay stick foundation this is
medium neutral it's so easy to apply and
it's really great it's buildable and
just a fast foundation so I like taking
a really big fluffy kind of brush when
I'm running late or at all times I feel
like it blends up the foundation really
well I don't know why just a foundation
like a
Australian or New Zealand person I just
find this is the easiest way to blend oh
you can add any extra foundation to
places that you need really easily and
then you can take a beauty blender and
they like to go over my face to absorb
any product that I don't need do you
guys like that I film my videos when I
hums it's my skin in this area is just
not I'm going for a microdermabrasion
this week concealer is the next up I'm
using this nyx concealer in cwo 3 it's
really peachy so it does cancel out
those dark circles really well also I
went back to the turn shape tape it's
just start shape tip is just really
really thick and I find this concealer
way easier to work with and way faster
to blend out I like the Tarte shape tape
when I have a lot of time to do my
makeup but my favorite I would say is
the Kat Von D I found that super
blendable and just beautiful coverage
buildable I'm actually gonna blend the
concealer out with a Beauty Blender can
also blend this out with your fingers I
really like blending things out my
fingers may blow up I'm gonna go still
use some cream products so I'm using the
Hollywood contour wand by Charlotte
Tilbury this wand is really great
because it's just like really blendable
and easy I find it easy to use in a rush
give some nice contour to the face I'm
going to be using the this brush
to blend it although I feel like for I
just I self tend to the other day so I'm
not too worried about being bronzed just
because I'm pretty bronzed for this time
of year I still want to add some
definition to my face
okay so powder time very crucial step
for me I'm going to use the glossy a
router this is like easiest powder to
use super fast and I'm gonna use their
brush because I really like it so I just
tap it in and then they go over my area
specifically my eyes my eyes had to
crease a lot I can really bang this
makeup look out in five minutes and they
usually do it you know when I'm running
late or if I need to look sort of
presentable you know I'm kind of a no
makeup kind of gal most the time but you
know sometimes you can't wear no makeup
or if you have one is it so you don't
only want to go in public and make them
I totally get it
you need to be Charlotte Tilbury
film-star bronze and blush glow I've
also really loved the benefit hoola
bronzer on I'm gonna be just a little
small brush to kind of just chisel out
some areas there is a blush in there if
you want to use it but I've just kind of
been feeling the charlotte tilbury cheek
to chic in ecstasy I just really love
the color I love it there's two colors
and I find easily blendable and just a
beautiful light pink sort of peachy
coral color you do you want to use them
where a brighter color cuz a brighter
color is gonna you know make things pop
on your face make you look a little more
youthful and awaken all that good stuff
the easiest highlight of all time is the
glossy halo scope I love this I love the
color gives it just gives a super
natural easy glow and I use my thing
because it's one of the products you
kind of want to warm up to use oh but I
just I love it I just put that too far
down a little bit but also the inner
corners hit the inner corners if you're
feeling tired this will make you look
more awake it's gonna brush my eyebrows
really quickly because they're getting a
little intense
you could add powder highlight on top of
that but I'm good with just this I'm
going to add a nude eyeliner to my
bottom lash line this really keeps me
feeling that I look awake it will kind
of contrast make your thighs the whites
of your eyes of whiter which makes you
look healthier and then gonna add a
brown eyeliner to the top line it's just
a bit softer than black and also I just
don't have a block just gonna spring my
face I'm just finishing this the whole
night your Springs I think I have two
more spices in there and then I normally
would use the telescopic by L'Oreal but
it's done I need to buy a new one it's
really clumpy and gross now so I'm just
gonna use this mascara that I have it's
okay it's an essence mascara but I don't
know too much about essence so I just
sent to me but I'm just gonna use it
right now use whatever mascara is your
most favorite and easiest to use that's
what i always recommend I always put
mascara my bottom lashes just my
personal preference and then since when
I'm gonna rush I don't usually put on my
mascara that well I take a q-tip I
always have q-tips on hand and they rub
off any excess mascara and any creasing
that's happened my eyes do crease pretty
intensely so I have to do that and then
I look at the time and see if I had any
extra time if I had any extra time I
probably would throw some eyeshadow on
obviously I know this is an ideal order
but it's all about time management here
and I would just throw on something like
this color like sort of shimmery color
just all over the lid
just to kind of pull look together
no just put it with my finger just a
nice bronze Sparkle really feel like is
kind of the easiest color to use so I'm
just going to throw on a really easy
color this is the NYX pin up out in
corset I also really love Charlotte pill
Charlotte Tilbury pillow talk since this
is basically like lip color you know
have to be like super precise with it
which I feel like is key and soon and
that would be how I look good in five
minutes if I need it to look a little
more dramatic and I only have five
minutes I would put on something like
the lorac matte lip color I think this
is a really easy product to put on gives
you select that bold lip makes you look
way more put together but it's not like
you don't to be really precise so this
is the lorac lip color in Rosewood
just looks like this super put together
again but it gives you more about darker
sort of vampy vibe so I love this as
well and let's just do the giveaway so
