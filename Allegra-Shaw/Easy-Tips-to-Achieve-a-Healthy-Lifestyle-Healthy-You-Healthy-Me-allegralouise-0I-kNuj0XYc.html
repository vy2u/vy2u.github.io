video and I'm partnering with continue
which is my network and so I'm writing a
bunch of different creators in the
network and we are all coming together
to make a playlist I guess of different
videos to help you get healthier on
April subs the World Health Day and
somebody coming out so I feel like
everyone's coming in the mindset of like
getting healthier just feeling better
you know feeling fresher and also like
dark and dreary cuz winter is now over
you might have come from their channel
to my channel see so it's so high but
everything will be linked down below to
check out their videos not play with
them all that good stuff in my video as
you can tell by the title is just five
simple easy and realistic tips to have a
healthier lifestyle so let's just jump
right into my workout clothes because
I'm going to go work get after this so
tip number one is drink more water and
it feel like this is the tip that
everyone gives but it's just so
necessary your body made up of like 60%
water so you need to replenish that
whirring - you just need to give your
body the water that it needs and you'll
just feel so much diving up so much more
energy and if you don't like water ah
some lemon to it eyes your home water
every morning one's a great little
tablet and Kickstarter especially in the
mornings and a lots of flavor to your
water as well drinking water is very
very important tip number two if you're
big snacker don't snap unhealthy items
like chips and chocolate bars and a lot
just gross like carrots and hummus or
pita and hummus or anything like that
and just kick out the old unhealthy
snaps bring in some healthy snacks you
can still eat and still have food and
satisfy your cravings but
without the unhealthy saturated
processed fat and the if number three is
to meditate this is a hard tip getting
in that hang of meditation can be a
difficult one it's definitely a practice
but you will honestly feel so much
better in your body and your spirit and
your mind and there's so many great apps
and books to help you start meditating
but if you suffer from anxiety or you
know you overreact or anything like that
meditation can just really calm you down
and give you a nice ten-minute break
mental break from the day and I highly
highly highly recommend it I have a
whole blog post about meditation so you
can also check that out and to help you
kind of get into it but I'm going to pit
every day and it has honestly changed my
life tip number four is exercise now
this is not to be going to the gym I
personally like going to the gym but
just finding you enjoy you could do like
those SoulCycle classes or you could go
for hikes or ride a bike or do a class
out of gym you know there's so many
different ways to exercise you don't
have to go to the gym and lift weights
but just make sure you get your heart
rate up being active and people feel so
much better and my last tip tip number 5
is get enough sleep I think when you're
tired you make a lot of unhealthy
choices and it's just harder to make
those like good healthy decisions so
just get up late get your 7 to 8 hours
or whatever your body needs there's a
great app called sleep cycle that will
actually help you wake you up so you
don't feel when you wake up you don't
feel like all brawn gained growth so
definitely get enough sleep your body
needs it and I can approach it for you
guys
protests don't drink alcohol during the
week alcohol is literally so bad for you
so instead of like going for a beer
after when we come home and you crack
open a beer like have a water have
something healthier Eleanor Guthrie
obviously you have your occasional drink
you can drink on the weekends like I'm
not saying cut alcohol out completely
but try to cut back a bit and I think
you'll feel a lot better because even if
you have a few drinks and then you don't
think you're drunk or anything
morning your bodies will cab process the
alcohol out of your system and you're
not going to feel the best you could
feel so cut back on the alcohol cut in
on the water and you'll feel so much
better thank you guys so much for
watching I love you all make sure to
check out the other creators videos and
you have a whole well-rounded playlist
on how to get a healthy kick start to
the summer and world health day thank
you so much for watching I love you all
peace love</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
