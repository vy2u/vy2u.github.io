foundation or teens sloshed what I do
with my face everyday for makeup just
what I wear to school so if you want to
see how to achieve this look really
basic really simple then keep watching
Thanks
so the first thing I do is I grab
foundation now I'm just going to use
this foundation right here it's the Mac
foundation MNC 20 it's pretty light this
is my winter right so in the summer it's
completely different what I usually do
is I put a little my hand like like that
much ish maybe a little more actually
now I you okay I think I just put too
much whatever okay now what I use is I
use um either a brush looks like this
her brush looks like this depending on
how I feel but today I used to use these
ones all the time and I'm just going to
use gonna use this one today it's come a
new fave so I just dab it in okay so
here you're just gonna blend out your
your foundation any method you like all
over your face um concentrating on the
areas of more redness I my redness is
more in my cheeks and around my eyes so
that's where I put most my foundation
and also later we'll put concealer there
too so just keep blending it down um
don't forget to put on your neck and
whatever is left over just on your chest
and that will give you full coverage
okay wrong one thing concealer now I
like this hard candy palette with the
three different shades there's those
shades and then it comes with like the
green the yellow and pink I like that
but I'm what i'm really liking is the
oil-free concealer from joy secret I
really really like that
I think it works really well and this is
in the color light light ten alright so
just get a little bit of concealer on to
your finger and dab it on to the just
right under your eye and you can start
to blend that out a bit start by
blending it underneath and work your way
to the top my lids are pretty red and I
like to conceal my whole eye and I just
like the way that looks better than just
covering up my dark circles and then
you're going to take a little bit more
and just put it around your nose next
you're gonna take a little bit more and
I have I broke out a bit on my chin so
I'm just going to cover that up my skin
is usually clear but today I had to use
a little bit extra concealer and put on
my chin and then you're done then what
I'm going to do is I am going to I
either use the covergirl trublend micro
minerals I can't tell if you can see
that anyway
or use the laurio bear natural um I've
been using this for a while this is
shimmery has some shimmer in it this
one's really matte I'm gonna use this
one right now just because and um if I'm
using the covergirl one I'll just use a
kabuki brush like this I actually like
this brush I like how little it it give
it a little
and it comes out like it's really
powdery no comment like that um all
right so just dab your brush in and put
it the powder all over your face I start
at my cheeks and I work my way around
usually they can afford to last and also
putting on my eyes to set all the
foundation and powder I'm also going to
take the rest I'm going to put it on my
neck bring it all the way down my neck
as you can see here and then swirling
the excess around my chest
now I'm going to okay
so now I turn my bronzer I want to try
the NARS look and I know all about NARS
but I really want to try the nurse will
give it a fight I bought this and it is
the Victoria Secret bronzer and goddess
looks like that's like three codes and
actually you can use them separately as
like highlights I really liked that too
um so yeah I just take a big fluffy
brushes from qo quo whatever I just kind
of tell them like that and I do I don't
really do a 3b but I just kind of get
everywhere because I'm really pale and I
need this then you put it on my neck
and on my chest just the excess also it
I'll do is all kind of squeeze it a
little bit and then kind of use it as
like a highlight just put it there down
the bridge of my nose just like the
places that if the Sun hit me or if I
was tanned they would be a little darker
a little bit so now what I'm in my gosh
snowing so much what I'm going to do it
this is a new thing I added to my
foundation routine I never used to
contour before because I'm so bad at it
but I've kind of thought a little better
and I got this brush I got like a little
Mac travel set and I really like it
actually I really like it so I've been
starting to a contour a little bit um I
just I use a benefit hoola hoola by
benefit bronzer because it's a not
shimmery at all you just dab my brush in
it
and let's put it right there
I always feel like I'm going to like
streak
and like where you conjure obviously
depends on your face but I think that
this makes a difference like from the
side to this one I think it's a pretty I
really I really like this brush and I
like how its small not like a big brush
iron I just this is the 16 168 SC brush
from Mac it came in a set though so you
can polish to get this brush meant zone
just blend it out
all right I like it enough I just like
doing I all of us are showing up great
on camera but I just
anyway I like the way the contouring
looks that's all I really contour I have
small nose I don't need to do that but
if you're going to contour your nose you
could do that I have two blushes that I
like adore this Bobbi Brown sand pink
this one right here I've literally used
this every day for the past like yeah
it's a travel sized one I don't even
know why I need a big one I I can't even
tell you how much I love this blush my
favorite blush I will I will buy this
over and over I don't think I will ever
know I use this it's the perfect tone
for winter especially for summer I love
it in summer I guess a tan I just okay
so my camera I like turned off or
something so what i did was i just i put
this blush on just right here and kind
of like blended it out and then I put
the NARS orgasm on top of that and then
I put mascara on which I don't know ride
it
covergirl I exact I lights took it put
it on my lashes like that and I was done
that's about it it's what I wear every
day so yeah if you want to our videos
