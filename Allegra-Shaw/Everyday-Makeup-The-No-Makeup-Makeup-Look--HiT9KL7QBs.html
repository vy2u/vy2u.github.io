makeup routine and this is like
mastering the no makeup makeup no makeup
makeup yeah I think this look is like
really in for every day and like who
doesn't want to look like they're
wearing new makeup but like look like
they're so naturally beautiful um so I
feel like I've really like perfected it
because I am a person who doesn't wear a
lot of makeup every day buy a lot of
makeup I mean it doesn't look like I'm
wearing a lot of makeup but a lot of you
beg to differ when you see all the
products that you sing it actually
doesn't take this long that long I can
do my makeup in like 7 minutes so
release and take that long but I do not
do my eyebrows so I feel like I did your
eyebrows I was like my god sometime um
but it's like just like super dewy
really glowy bronzy just how I want to
look every day just prep fresh and
pretty and yeah what are we in my face
right now uh if you like this video
remember to subscribe to my channel
please and follow me on Instagram and
like my Facebook page like a shawl or
Louise you know everything we link down
below very much appreciated if you do
though so yes let's just get into it so
in first taking the Charlotte Tilbury
wonder glow and putting this on any
parts of my face that I want to be super
dewy
so just cheekbones and a little bit on
the forehead down my nose all that good
stuff
then I'm taking the Charlotte Tilbury
light wonder foundation I'm pretty sure
this is in medium I think and I'm
putting that all over my face with a D
blender but you can also do this with
your fingers if you want a lighter
coverage next going back to an oldie but
goodie the Maybelline instant age rewind
concealer for your under eyes and I'm
taking this in light and making
triangles and then gonna blend it out
with a beauty brand blender
I'm now taking the Bobbi Brown bronzer
in natural and I'm taking a really large
angled brush and blending this all out
all over my face because I don't want
any harsh lines this is my favorite part
so I'm taking the benefit high beam and
I'm putting this under my eyes on my
nose chin underneath my natural contour
and anywhere else that I want my skin to
be highlighting and dewy and then I'm
gonna blend it out with a Beauty Blender
and it gives you this unbelievable
effect I'm obsessed with it so I
actually first blended it with my
fingers and then I'm going with the
Beauty Blender but the fingers will
really make it sink into the skin more
and the skin will accept it Lauren oh
look way more natural and then just take
the Beauty Blender and kind of Pat it on
your skin to make it look more
airbrushed and blend it out
I switch back and forth between blushes
but I like this one because it is the
most natural so it's just the tart
Dollface and I'm just doing little
circular motions on my cheekbones and on
the apples of my cheek
this step is optional you don't have to
do it but I think it gives a really nice
effect so I'm just taking the laura
mercier eye primer in light ivory and
putting that on my eyelids and then
blending that out I think it just makes
the canvas look a little nicer and
cleaner and then I'm taking the L'Oreal
telescopic carbon black mascara which
I'm obsessed with and putting that on my
lashes
you could really add any lip color that
you want this is the Loreal color riche
pink perseverance lip thing and I really
like the color it's really natural and
pretty so I put that on my lips then I'm
taking the wet and wild white eyeliner
and putting that on my bottom eye thing
looks like called I type line waterline
on my waterline hmm and then I'm taking
the Rimmel magnifies eyeshadow and jump
and just putting on the inner corner of
my eyes and pressing that in and
blending everything out and then you are
done I hope you guys enjoyed this video
and I hope it helped you out I will talk
to you soon love you goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
