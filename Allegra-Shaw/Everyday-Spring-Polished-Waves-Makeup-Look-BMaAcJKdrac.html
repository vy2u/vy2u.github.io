to get to these polished everyday the
waves along this really pretty and
simple makeup look to go with the hair
and look is perfect for spring
I want to thank sweat scoff for
sponsoring as well as collaborating with
me on this video they used to be a brand
that you could only get in salons but
now it's available to everyone which is
fantastic hello all these products and
they smell so good
so we want to find out how to recreate
this look then just keep watching so as
you guys know I only wash my hair once a
week so when I do I need something super
hydrating so I used the Schwarzkopf
amber and oil shampoo and conditioner
and it looks like this and the Sun is
great is specifically designed for
damaging dry hair and it smells so good
we want the look to look really
texturize and voluminous so I'm taking
the biotin in volume magic powder and
I'm just going to put this in my roots
and then flip my head and work it in so
this will create a lot of natural
looking texture
this look obviously needs some heat to
create these waves so we always want to
use a heat protectant and if you are
blow-dry of your hair then you want to
use heat protection before you blow-dry
your hair but I on my hair dry naturally
so I'm going to put the heat protectant
in now I'm using the crystal shine he
protected in this whole protect right
here against the Hot Tools and it will
also create a little added shine which
is above this then you just want to let
that dry can even brush it through so
that you get it all over your hair so
the next we're going to curl my hair I'm
going to use this one-inch curling iron
you can use a bigger barrel if you'd
like it will work just the same I'll
just be a little bit looser but I'm
gonna stick with the one-inch
first I'm gonna section off the hair it
doesn't have to be perfect at all then
you want to take a small section of hair
about this big and I'm going to wrap it
around the curling iron and we'll leave
the bottom out
so just put that much hair out then
often study one take it out and just
pull on the curl a little bit to make it
fancy and then you want to just repeat
this all over your head and you can
either do all the curls going away from
your face or you can switch it up and do
the curls going different directions
which will make it look a little bit
more natural so I'm going to do
different directions so I can show you
so for the second section of hair we're
going to curl it forward leaving that
section out and then you just want to do
that all over your head
so when your Diner hair should look like
this very tightly curled a little bit
Goldilocks looking and we want to be
looser and texturized and not so perfect
I'm taking their bites and in volume dry
shampoo you guys know I love a good dry
shampoo this stuff it got and it smells
so good and this stuff is great because
it will refresh in hair it will give the
hair a really nice smell and it will
also give a lot of texture and volume so
just want to put this in the roots and
in natural curls as well you want to
take the comb or your fingers and you
want to lightly brush out the curls so
about they're looser so this look is
pretty much done now but we want a
little to hold so I'm going to use these
Schwarzkopf crystal and shine hairspray
this just out of the finishing touches
it gives us some body as well some shine
and it's not sticky and dry lip out so
that's always nice
mmm I love the small of these products
oh my god so the air is not complete and
I love this look I'm very stuff so I
wear it anytime I actually like to do my
hair and now we're going to move on to
makeup so I'm just going to take a
luminous foundation to dip moisturizer
kind of thing and work that all over my
face
I love this super light coverage but
still even say your skin tone I'm going
to see if you can see let me put that
under my eyes as well as on any
blemishes
plenty meadow
I have steered away from contouring
lately but I'm going to take a matte
bronzer and a brush in this kind of put
it in a 3b motion so it's a little more
natural I'm not so heavy
then I'm going to put a cream blush on
my cheeks with a stippling brush and
this will give a really pretty glow and
radiance to the face and then I'm going
to take a liquid bronzy highlight put
this on the high points and then I'm
going to get cream champagne color
shadow and I'm going to put this on my
eye lid and then you want to take a
matte Brown shadow something that is
just a little bit deeper than your skin
tone and throw that in the crease and
take a mix highlight shade under the
eyebrow and then you want to top that
off with your favorite mascara and to
finish off the look use one I put on
your favorite light pink mascara figure
the leg pick the lipstick I hope you
