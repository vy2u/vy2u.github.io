make up realize what is everyday when I
want to put makeup on but that isn't
very often but uh yeah I got my hair
done I don't know if you tell I you
can't help get them all blonde anymore
and my natural hair color this is my
natural hair color I like on top of it
like I love it I think it looks so good
I'm so over being blonde so this is my
hair and you want to know what I'm going
to say the hair before I go to Anita
does my color and Hannah does my cut I
got it cut to cleaned up the edges and
all that and they are at loanin Cove
here in Toronto at Robbie and Queen
highly recommend them they're like my
everything I have a big crush on both of
them they are epic
so that's who did my hair I was mapped
let's just get right into the video okay
so I'm filling my bathroom because I
just thought it'd be like the best
location to film okay so I filmed the
video before and my mic wasn't
completely plugged in so there was no
sound and then wasn't gonna do a voice
over because who likes voiceovers over
someone like using their lips okay so
the first thing is that I use oh wait
yeah I first going with the Dermalogica
hydro blur primer and I like this little
thing on the end here I'm not I think
it's to make it stand up I don't really
notice for but I like it and I want it I
smooster eyes and all that good stuff
you can check out my skincare routine if
you want to see that and then I just put
this on lightly you want to rub your
face too hard in any situation
this is to go over and I like this stuff
it's some nice I feel like it really
does blur out your pores makes your
makeup lock and smooth and all that good
stuff
although I do really want to try the dr.
Brandt one which I will try when I run
out of ticks this Vaseline iPod since I
was a baby
like this is a vastly my mom I'm pretty
sure he's to like use on my bum when I
was like a baby do you got some of these
bombs I know I did but I still have it
which is kind of gross I don't use it
that often but anyway so what I've been
loving is the Charlotte Tilbury light
Wonder and Wonder glow and I use this
when I am my skin colour that I am now
which is white and then I'll use the
NARS I'm gonna have like self tan on set
on self tangent heavily I see NARS
medium one Punjab
but I have a self hand in a really long
time Iowa self can my birthday is next
week so I will self tan before everyday
but I don't really care anymore I used
to want to be so tanned and like I just
honestly don't care what whatever okay
some ideas do you wonder which needs a
wash but you never take the wonder glow
which is just like a pretty like glowy
like highlight sort of thing I'm not
really sure what it does want me to mix
it in with the foundation and I get this
foundation I think it light free no.3
fair gosh
that's crazy I'm very pale but this is
my natural skin tones if I have not
tanned or anything in forever and then
I'll just kind of like dot it all over
my face and like I try to focus
obviously around middle and then I blend
it out they don't really need coverage
and that over portions of my face and
then I just blend it out with my Beauty
Blender I only really wear makeup when
I'm like going to a meeting or like I
have to really interact with people but
if I'm just like running errands or in
my home working from home kind of thing
I feel no need to wear makeup I like to
let my skin breathe I feel like your
skin care like really just like works
butter
we don't wear makeup not what I have to
say this where is it Renae reuleaux
auntie's this treatment you get
sophistic acne amazing it's really
really good stuff like it actually works
and I've never experienced any product
that actually works for cystic acne so I
will link it down below it's incredible
and then what I'll do is I'll take a
little more foundation in areas that I
need it so just chin and then this fist
this is not like a cystic acne spot it's
just like a cyst on my face which I've
had for about two months now so probably
should have gone to the doctor but never
who cares I probably care and I'm going
to blend it out obviously
and then I have been using like the most
extra concealer game products use three
concealers so first I go in with the
Tarte shape tape in fair neutral which
is super light but it works like that
and then I like lightly highlight but
since I don't want to be like white cat
I take the Maybelline instant age rewind
can I mix it in just under the eyes so
that I'll get like a nice highlight
under here but it won't go too much
there now if I have any blemishes I use
be born this way light/medium concealer
by Too Faced so I want to like highlight
tips right you want them to like not be
there so very extra but I mean like
believe extra person in the world
and then I just dab it in to skin
and your life
I'm so glad you guys can't like even
this behind me so messy my house is like
like a nightmare right now because we
had a shipment in of products can we
just drop three products on Uncle so I
have all the products like cart next and
we'll put them into the dungeon yet it's
just like you own my house it
hasn't been like cleaned and so long oh
my god but I want to get a cleaning lady
once a month that's what I want like I
can do the link I just need like a deep
clean once a month
hmm I'll do the spray bleach everywhere
and like you can't see yourself in any
of the mirrors or like anything in my
house so that's good oh I'm also going
to be selling some clothes on D pop I
think up stay up
that's just like heard about it a bunch
of times and I just really want to sell
some clothes because I'm trying to make
my wardrobe like and when I want 30
items my wardrobe knocks it I'm really
sick of having a lot of that I
don't need so I'm going to be selling a
bunch of stuff on there if you want to
follow me I think my user name is
Allegra Louise but I'll be placed with
upik today which is Monday so you won't
go up to tomorrow so I'm sure look
probably put up tonight so I'm sure my
stuff will still be there and then I
haven't really been setting my face I
just use the laura mercier secret
brightening powder with this fluffy
brush and I just put it under the eyes
and over top of the eyes to set all of
that and then if there's any areas that
I just don't want anything to like come
off
I'll just dab this but that's it haven't
really been studying anything else and
then I use my hoola bronzer hope I was
white right now I don't want that white
impersonal look I'll show you since like
how I look so I'll take this little
angled brush on my hoola bronzer which
is basically done and I'll just bronze
up the face a little bit add some color
back in
since my neck and chest are like pretty
white I can translate these lips out
but like my foundation is my skin
perfectly which is nice because if you
have to put bronzer all over your face
you obviously have the wrong Janusz in
color
then I'll just lightly drag it down my
neck and then I'm using tard expose I've
been using this for a while one of my
favorites it's just really natural and
like very lightly I'm not something kind
of fun that I've been doing is taking
this nyx t WB o nyx tango with bronzing
powder um it's like very sparkly sin oh
one and I just take it very lightly on
this brush like very lightly and I just
put it right over in my blush and just
gives it a little bit of shine that's it
and I've been using this Becca cream
highlighter with this morphe brush
there's no number on it but it just
looks like that so angles and I take the
highlighter and I just put it in some
highlighting places and dragging my
highlight down pretty far and I kinda
like that look I drag down my nose and
then keep it though everything's like
very like messy oh not messy I don't
look messy but it's not like perfect
now I take some more and I actually just
put this on my eyelids to get some shine
inner corners
and I guess I wanted to look like more
presentable I would put eyeshadow on but
on an everyday basis I really don't feel
the need to do that this is like done
like this is what my face looks like and
then I'll add some finishing spray into
Naevia
a little bit let that set in and then
I'll take my cool liner this is Marc
Jacobs I just want to finish this one
and i align my tight line and then I've
been just using roller lash because I'm
out of my telescopic so I've even
sometimes just use like eyelash tint
like the benefit lash tint because I
don't care about like like on an
everyday basis I don't need my lashes to
be like really long or anything so I'm
sorry so like not wearing makeup that
when I pull it a little bit messing
around like wow crazy I want to go out
at night who does lots of better be long
and full just like to make sure they're
like even and like everything it's like
looking normal like my eyes are like so
different it's a lot especially the
lashes like they just do whatever they
want a nice awesome the bottom like not
a lot just like take off any powders I
got on if I'm like hungover or tired
I'll add this nude eyeliner to the
bottom and then I will add Tarte exposed
if you like it
and my favorite lip liner Jesus heart
expose is the NYX lip liner in natural
or new they both go really well I'm
going to clean this up a bit
that's my everyday guys very simple yeah
