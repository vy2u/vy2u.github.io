today's video is going to be a styling
video about styling a leather jacket or
styling a statement jacket because my
leather jacket is a statement jacket if
you would watch my August long you would
have seen me go into namesake and
customize my own leather jacket I'm
going to show you the finished product
I'm gonna walk you through the whole
process of customizing a jacket at
namesake in Toronto this is a shock and
I got very very marry me I got full
studying on sorry it's kind of hard to
show you both studying on the collars
and the sleeves okay that you can see
though it's so heavy
I have spikes I have a belt the inside
is Navy and then see here it says a
lycra namesake which I really love and
they also got this really pretty little
this is their like signature thing on
the back so with customizing a jacket
it's like it's fully customizable we
went through the whole process so you
first start with a style so the style I
chose is the bonny but there are tons I
really love the Yoko as well along our
sort of leather jacket I think is really
beautiful but there are eight to choose
from and they're all named after
influential women so that's pretty cool
and then the leather you pick your own
leather they have leather ranging from
you know us farm deer which is a
byproduct of the food industry so it is
a suitable way to get leather to you
know lamb from Italy there's a silver
one there's suede there's like whatever
you want
they have hardware I chose silver
hardware because I wanted my jacket to
be very classic but they have rose gold
they have gold they have black they have
whatever you want and then the lining as
you saw I got this beautiful navy color
because like I think maybe is my
favorite color but they have a ton of
different linings like white or black or
pink or burgundy burgundy would be
beautiful so there's tons of different
lining to choose from and then you can
do add-on so my add-ons were obviously
the customized studying this is all hand
done
and I also got about I have zippers on
the back here tube you don't have to
have like there's you don't have those
you could get lacing up the back you
could do know about so probably the most
important part of the customization
process is the fit you go into the
studio and the jacket is fully sorry the
turnaround the jacket is fully fit to
your body
tailored adjusted to fit you perfectly
it fits your body like a glove so
Namesake kind of caters to women who are
not off the rack shoppers whether that
be just because you know your body type
or because you just have personal
preferences and you want something kind
of unique and different you know maybe
you have really broad shoulders and it's
hard to find a leather jacket that fits
you or maybe you want something really
cropped or you know not everyone is the
same and there's so many different body
types out there that I think when you
customize a something to fit you it's
just gonna make you feel so confident
and so good I said all of the base
silhouettes are named off of you know
influential women there's Emmeline
Pankhurst there's George O'Keefe is Yoko
Ono Grace Jones there's tons of
different women that have influenced
history these jackets are meant to like
empower you you know you feel like a
badass when you're wearing a leather
jacket so these jackets are meant to
empower you make you feel good and
that's the whole thing around namesake
what I really like about namesake is
they're participating in the slow
fashion movement which is very similar
to uncle they're not into over producing
and over manufacturing they're
one-of-a-kind handmade sort of items
that are tailored to you and they ensure
that materials aren't wasted which I
really appreciate so you can go into the
namesake studio they can give you the
whole behind-the-scenes of the jacket
they can tell you where the jackets
coming from where the leathers coming
from and you're really involved in the
problem in the process as I said many
times my channel not knowing where your
clothes are coming from it's kind of you
know sketchy like I want to know exactly
where my stuff is coming from who's
making it and this makes me feel really
good because I know who made it I know
where was made and I had the whole story
behind it so I feel really amazing
wearing this jacket I think it's super
me and it's just like something I'm
gonna keep for the rest of my life I'm
gonna be like an old badass mom wearing
this jacket you know like
it's exactly what I wanted these jackets
are more on the pricier side but I'm
gonna have this forever and no one else
has it which is amazing have my name on
it okay so in this video I'm showing you
six ways to style my jacket my jacket is
a statement jacket so it can be harder
to style and if you go get a custom-made
jacket you know yours might be a
statement jacket as well and you want to
know how to style it so that's what this
video is about you can click the link in
the downbar to go to the namesake
website you do end up getting a jacket I
would love if you could say that you
know I sent you and you learned buddy
and stick for me I'm really it really
have so much respect for this company
and for Rosa who is the owner of this
company so yeah let's just get right
into the outfits and thank you for
listening to my little rant
he got even a lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
