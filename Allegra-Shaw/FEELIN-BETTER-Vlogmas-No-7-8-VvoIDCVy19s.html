til 4 last night again so I was just on
a call I have another call in a bit I am
just like going through YouTube right

need to clean that I need to shower I
would be ideal if I could shower um get
my shit together
and then we have so much work to do
today and I am so tired so yeah he just
had a meeting and now we're gonna take
some product photos for the website for
uncle we are dropping a sweatshirt today
and then we just have some more work
stuff to do not a very exciting day
can't auction tomorr
my shame I'll mute it
why do cabs do this like I think I can
see their blinker data worst drivers
fuck you cabs I've been reading your
comments on my last vlog and they're
super sweet and I really appreciate it
but I'm okay I'm like I'm not sad I just
didn't well I just didn't feel like
filming it wasn't like a real breakup it
was just something ending and I just was
like you know why I wasn't filming but
I'm okay like totally cool but your
comments are very sweet and very much
appreciated
really appreciate it but I'm okay
so right now I'm heading in to the gym
not gonna take you with me I don't know
I'm going to you if I ever go to the gym
like every day and haven't taken you
with me yet I just I like to respect
people's privacy and I know people don't
like to be filmed working out so I need
to find a gym location that you know it
doesn't have a lot of people in it so
holy shit today has been the longest day
of my life it is 11 p.m. and I'm still
working so basically we dropped the only
shadow we dropped we dropped this hoodie
we dropped this hoodie it's called the
poor boy hoodie and we dropped a
shearling jacket - shearling denim
jacket which it hasn't hadn't said that
yet but it was just a really long day
full of meetings and nothing that I
could really film because it's all kind
of confidential and super boring for you
guys but it's just been like non-stop
work all day and I am so tired but right
now I am making dinner my we have
someone in like in our family that does
meals on wheels I think she like owns it
at not honor like CEO I don't know idea
forget um but I had like a few of the
meals on wheels meals and it's all I
have so making one of those they're
pretty healthy they're actually pretty
good for you they're like okay tasting
but I meant I love meals on wheels it's
great hey I'm just very tired so I still
have some work to get done I'm gonna end
today's vlog here and I will combine it
with tomorrow because I couldn't
remember what day yeah I'll come by
tomorrow actually before I go I want to
show you what these meals-on-wheels
meals look like so that's salmon with
some rice and I don't know what that is
and some vegetables let me just read it
for you it is salmon and lemon sauce
pink salmon with rice and vegetables
so that's what it looks like I don't
normally eat this but I have literally
no food and had no time to get food
today but it's not bad for you and if
you didn't know I actually don't have a
microwave at my house so I had to put
this in the oven to put in the oven for
50 minutes not bad but it says it's 320
calories tender the fat for five
milligrams of Wester all 50 by 20 I
don't know I want to say you care so I'm
really care I'm starving that's that's
the bottom line
okay bye happy vlogmas day I don't know

meeting and I am very late so that's I
can't take you I'm sorry so I just got
back from that meeting um I'm very tired
I have a coffee I have to go send out
some uncle orders and then I'm gonna
film a few videos today yeah so tired I
just found the perfect gift for my
cousin I'm so excited
I always think holiday gift cards on
YouTube will never help me but I watched
one and honestly like it gave me so many
ideas so Emma if you're watching this I
have half of your gift and I can't get
you a slop chop because the reviews on
this will help Jennifer actually
cheerful and I'm not Casey's not getting
that but I really did look into it but
the reviews are awful so sorry guys it's
snowing finally

on and so when he went up there and
snowy but I got my stuff dropped off the
packages and now work time oh my god

juice to keep my immune system
