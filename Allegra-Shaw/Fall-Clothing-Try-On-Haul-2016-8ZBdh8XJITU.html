tea Tron whistle feel better have been
sickened so long but I have a few things
here actually a lot of things here and I
want to show you I'm gonna the first
thing they're actually on my feet right
now so I'm going to take one of them off
I got these low top bands and I also
have the high top bands just really like
them um these are the old school ones
and then that other ones are like the
high-top skates I think this black and
you guys know I love converse so it's
just like a variation of golfers
basically I don't have to dress up I
don't have to like I'm like this is
casual everyday so it's I just wear
sneakers and it's really great my house
actually just wore those to the bar -
yeah okay next item you guys saw this in
my fall outfits video if you haven't
seen that I picked this up from Gladrags
which is my online store and I actually
didn't really think I was gonna like
this skirt on me but turns out I really
like it this is the Free People um I
don't know what it's called snap vegan
snap skirt so it's vegan leather and it
has buttons down the front here and it's
just such a good length like it like
covers your bonnet like is really nice
like shape and I wore this to dinner in
Chicago with a go I actually wore that
outfit that you saw in that video this
is a try on haul so there will be some
images of me trying things on right here
um but I really like this skirt and we
sell it for an insane price all the
fridge will stuff on wad rights is very
very discounted um so check that out if
you like this skirt but if you're
looking for a leather skirt which I
really like leather skirts this one just
like isn't too short and just like fits
properly
I go to 0 and I think we're all sold out
of zeros but there's two there's four
sixes you know another thing I'm just
going to do all the free cable stuff
from Gladrags first I got this a while
ago but I want to show
because we still have it up on the site
but I bought this in the summer I bought
this it's like a gray t-shirt bodysuit
and again like I'm not a huge bodies do
person but I wore this with black
high-waisted jeans and a belt and
booties and like it just looked so good
it's just simple outfit you're just like
so form-fitting and like I have my hair
did and I just felt so like hot so um I
don't know how much this one is on the
website but I don't be linked down below
mine is a small I think yeah and it's
just like a perfect cut v-neck cut like
showed a little bit of cleavage not too
much and I'm just obsessed really soft
super soft it's a body suit so it stays
tucked in and has snaps so you can pee
um and then the other thing I bought
which you saw in my my thing
what is it ah my back to school video is
as three people sweater with the bell
sleeves Brown the night cropped and it's
just so nice wearing a bra LED under
that and like having these belt sleeves
you're so in again this is like crazy
discounted on the website and it looks
really nice on if you want to buy
something there's the discount code
called the discount code wanderlust so
to get 25% off you'll stuff we still
already salt for discounted prices for
Microsoft the discounted price which is
sweet okay on the next um I'm gonna show
you my thing um I have been saving up
for this leather jacket for a while like
it's been something like you know I was
I'm gonna buy um I yeah I needed a new a
jacket and I wear leather jackets like I
had one from Zara and I wore it all the
time this is like not a purchase where
it's like I'm spending a lot of money on
something that I'll never wear like I
wear one almost every day and then
especially in the fall so I got Keith
who got the bow fern AllSaints biker
jacket
um and when I was deciding on uh what
leather jacket I was gonna get I kind of
wanted like a cow's leather and thick
cows leather um but you know I went with
one that I could wear in all three
seasons spring summer and fall so it's
it is lightweight but you can throw a
sweater under it
um very soft leather and I'm just I'm
straight-up obsessed this my first like
nice really expensive leather jacket and
I hope to have this one for you because
it's such a classic shape and I well
never get sick of it I'm already worn it
like I got it caught in Chicago
and I've worn it every day yeah
now the next thing is I kinda regret
this purchase because like it's not
really what I wanted um but whatever
it's just a hmm sweater it's just this
like knit sweater it was like $29 not on
a medium so it's like oversized but I'm
just like I don't know I don't really I
come and wish I didn't get it because I
just wish I got a nicer quality um one
from like a Ritz yeah because this isn't
really what I wanted but it is like it
whatever sweater you know it's just like
a good sweater not too fond of it and
then I went to a Michelle field line
Abercrombie I feel like I got something
else that I can't remember what I got
actually I got would probably stuff I
don't care what anyone says I still like
it um I got this black button down shirt
everything was on sale and they always
have good sales so everything is really
cheap it's kind it's not sheer but it's
not like super thick um
inch to block button-up shirt actually
wanted one I like type open with like
really deep Oh open with like a bralette
um so yeah and then I got this candy
that was ten dollars I don't really like
it it's not really I don't really like
the how high knees go up but I mean it's
not bad it was $10 so I can't complain
um it's just a block simple cami and
then you saw this in
my fault favorites but I got this
burgundy wool coat when I bought this
one it was on sale and I got it for like
$70 or something and now I
it's I think it's the hundredth but just
wait for a sale if you want it and you
can get it but that will be linked down
below it's my fall outfits but it's
really achieved is like hunter percent
wool and pretty sure okay this is not in
English so not in English but yeah um
and then the next thing I got is another
coat I live in Canada
if you don't know live in Toronto and I
just think you can never have enough
coats because we have winter for eight
months of the year so it's nice to not
always have to throw on the same coat I
mean on crazy cold days like I'm just
throwing my Canada goose on but on the
days that it's not super cold I like to
have options um so I got this like this
coat from Zara I mean it's really hard
to show you but it's just a ripoff of
the acne one I actually thought about
getting yaki one I'm like kind of really
just finding $3,000 in the coat no and
especially when this one looks really
similar it's really soft and it's really
nice like it's a fake shearling coat it
was a hundred and sixty dollars which is
a really good compared to 3000 and it
looks exactly like the acne one so
whatever I love it and then who are you
guys a setting for this cuz I'm excited
for this um this is what you all have
been waiting for uh so uncle my clothing

babies so nice um with like a half
