makeup look of kind of being more into
the makeup looks and like trying new
things out I'm using a lot of the same
products I always use I love my staples
and I really always go back to them and
just incorporating some new and some old
to create this look amazing for fall you
have super glowy red lip great
transition great transition makeup look
from the summer to the fall to winter so
I hope you guys enjoy this video and
yeah let's get into it
so the first thing I'm gonna do is take
the clinic beyond perfecting foundation
and concealer this foundation is
incredible it is super full coverage but
it doesn't feel like you're any wearing
any makeup and it's very matte so I love
that and I just blended it with a Beauty
Blender and then I'm taking the tarte
concealer the stick concealer this is
the creamiest concealer it's amazing so
I put that on my under eyes as well the
knee blemishes and then I also blend
that out with a Beauty Blender then just
to set everything I'm taking the Revlon
nearly naked powder and just putting
that in any areas that makeup tends to
come off a little bit so t-zone and on
my chin then taking the Tarte Park
Avenue princess matte bronzer I am going
to do a light contour
this whole look is using the naked
palette so just take naked from the
Naked palette and put that all over your
lid and then take sidecar from The Naked
palette as well and put that right on
top and then I'm taking buck on a
fluffier brush and I'm just lightly
lightly putting that in the crease then
just clean off your brush and blend out
like blend it a lot a lot a lot so you
can't see any lines at all it's just
gonna look like one little gradient
effect then I'm taking the color virgin
to highlight under my brow as well as
the inner tear-duct and then taking my
favorite blush Dallas by benefit and
using that adding some mascara this is
the covergirl bombshell volume and then
Cruella by NARS for the lips this color
is amazing so nice and it stays on
then take rebel by Mac and press it on
just to darken it up and soft and gentle
by Mac for my face highlight and that is
it for this look really simple and the
eyes are super natural but the lips are
bold I'm totally in love with this look
I wear it all the time now and that is
all I hope you guys enjoyed this video
and I will talk to you soon bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
