going up today and I just realize like
I'm never I look like a mess in
every clip like I never wearing makeup
like my hair's like disgusting and ratty
so I'm gonna try was better for y'all
anyway um I'm trying out this new
protein because I bought ok ok so I
bought the slender blend by protein
world because I heard it's really great
I want to make the butt a little bigger
so I heard it was great this is the
weight loss one like I don't want to
lose weight but I heard this one is
really good and it's like non-gmo
superior taste nowhere to no aspartame
whatever but it is whey protein and whey
protein is like an extract of it's a
cheese by-product so it contains dairy
contains milk which is way and will milk
well
milk really hurts my stomach and also
like I'm on a big fan of the dairy
industry so I just didn't think this
through when I got this I just wasn't
thinking so uh yeah sucks cuz it's
actually really good it's like a really
nice like say not thick but like
sometimes when you have this is vanilla
like sometime gonna have a vanilla
protein it tastes very watery and like
just want to throw up but this one
tasted very nice so you could just
Rickon with water so today I'm going to
try the Vega protein smoothie and this
is the berry one this one is gluten free
no sugar added and also it's a
plant-based proteins so it's not a whey
protein and it doesn't contain dairy so
it's vegan so really nice I even my mom
was very significant shows with her when
I bought this and she was like sometimes
those vegan things can Mac getting a lot
of blood read all the ingredients all
very natural smells divine so I'm going
to test it out
so before I've even tasted it my initial
reaction is that it's very
very fine compared to other proteins a
very fine mill powder and it just stuck
everywhere some add some ice to it does
roll and fill it up with some water and
then give you a little you know uh I
can't think of the word I almost just
took a sip without you guys okay also
like calm looks nasty but well I
wouldn't say it's great but I also
wouldn't say it's bad
I mean protein is never like a delicious
I know I just the other ones delicious
but you know it's still protein I don't
think I shirt this one up enough coffee
you know I don't know it's alright not
bad I mean I don't like sit there and
enjoy my protein drinks I just can't
drink them as fast as I can
yeah okay updated I actually taste like

I hate it I think it would be fine in a
smoothie but this tastes awful
oh whoa that's not great tastes like
peas like plants Wow
it would taste goodness me though woof
hello hate when I start blogs like but
so right now I am I just put up a new
video like edited and stuff for Gladrags
it's really cool I might actually put
the Gladrags videos on my channel cuz
like why not like they're usually like
outfit ideas and stuff which feels like
is useful
I'm just mailing some orders oh just
exciting and then I am making up women T

got done that yet to be so expensive oh
my god and then I'm actually getting my
hair done well I'm getting it colored

gonna use to it you know it's just like
crazy being like I've never had it where

think this is really funny and I wanted
to address it second so has a lot of you

on the site under the name Jamie and
dressed and literally trolling the
website and just like writing the worst
reviews on things even though that I
haven't bought anything do you mean it's
like it's just like and reposting is
because my last review got taken down
there's no swearing or inappropriate
comments I simply shared my honest
thoughts but on the quality is terrible
with sweaters not what the price just
shows the company he's not honest the
sweater as I say this awful blah blah
blah this person hasn't bought anything
like they have like this particular item
that they're talking about like no one's
purchased it so I'm like what what the
 I just hate people I really do so
Jamie interest if you're watching this
hi really great that you love to troll
my website you have nothing better to do
with your time I'm such a blog blogger I
literally just did like all this fun
well I just filmed a lookbook so it's
like a really small lookbook very
specific to an event but
I didn't vlog any of it but maybe I'll
get some people just like you some
footage I'm like oh we have really funny
footage actually I can use that in this
log you know the like like running and
shellfish on Instagram I want to do that
so badly even though it's like really
all you have to do it's like breaking
this leg dance I just this is so adult
I'm gonna show you my address but I just
got this in the mail
the 2016 consensus but they do like the
Canada consensus it was just so adult
you know like saying that like yeah one
person lives in this house and that's me
actually got my ID changed I haven't
done that I don't want you though you
know like I still want to be resident of
the beaches but I kind of have to like
legally I guess
oh yeah so we just filmed a lookbook and
I'm gonna edit thought now he's just
gonna go up tomorrow and I'm just like
I'm just watching some YouTube just
watching some YouTube videos right now
and I'm like so tired
so my pucking French press broke this
morning I was very upset so I didn't get
coffee which is like what the f so we
have to buy a French press I'm actually
thinking of buying another camera
because I'm gonna be doing some
traveling this summer and I don't want
to bring my t5i with like my 35
milliliter no later my 35 millimeter
lens because it's just like such a
massive camera with the lens and you
know so I'm thinking about getting like
a vlog camera I'm gonna do some research
on whose vlogs I like I like I'm the
camera and Nicki black-letter uses I
don't know if you watch her but I feel
like that's a good camera but I want
some like very good quality but like
small I know there's like the gx7
yeah yeah I'm very upset because
I know it apartments so dry um my hair
is crazy what is because yesterday my
French press broke I was like trying to
make coffee hidden no hole all the glass
shattered IKEA and so usually I
like make coffee while I read a chapter
of Zen mind beginner's mind which is
book and then while the coffee kind of
cools down I meditate but now that my
modems broken her my French press is
broken I like my morning
like I don't know what to do myself so
I'm just gonna like meditate now and
then I have to go get coffee I hate
that
and also I left my herbs outside all
night one night I think they're all dead
and I'm very upset
look so my concierge my building thinks
like I don't know what they think I do
but I go and check her packages every
day and then there I think they think
I'm like a serious shopping addiction or
something and I'm like no like a rough
run an online store and I do YouTube
which like just results in a lot of
packages but look what I got it some
growers cider and they get looks like

water them anyway bye hey so I've just
been like reading a lot of comments and
I know there's so many good comments on
my videos and obviously those like or
what mean the most to me but I know like
you know the mean common shouldn't
bother you in whatever and usually they
don't but just I feel like maybe lately
I've just been seeing the mean ones like
more and it's not like it like I'm like
hurt or anything it's just surprising
how judgmental people are and like you
know I had a woman on one of my videos a
woman call me a basically and like
tell me that I wanted to be I think I've
already maybe said this like tell me I
wanted to be skinny so that I would
sleep with a lot of men or comment like

what kind of person is she like huge
slide you know showed you my bra whoa
crazy I try to be as authentic as I can
in videos and I'm pretty like open I
think that people should just be people
and I just I'm not I just I don't know I
just think it's crazy and like it just
gets like I had a person send you a
message telling me like a direct message
telling me that they are so offended by
the content that I put out and that I
should be Slade take down my content
because it was so offensive to them and
laying
I am 23 years old you know
I am halfway through my 23rd years being
alive I am an adult I am a fully grown
well not fully crowned I wouldn't say
that I'm kind of like a child still but
I am a woman and I don't try to be a
mentor I just try to be me and I swear
and I'm a human and you know like I'm
not gonna pretend to be like a teeny
bopper because I'm going if I was you
