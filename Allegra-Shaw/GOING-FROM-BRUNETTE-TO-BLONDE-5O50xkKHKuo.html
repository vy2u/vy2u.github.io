gonna shoot this meeting soon and Joey's
gonna pop champagne I was so not
eventful
do you like your job
what but wiser party
thank you Bob Lazar two procedures
Budweiser for the ticket we got premium
beef for Jack Johnson John Jackson John
Jackson and Oh at this I have actually
took someone's left
you
we're trying to adolescence logs and
having two issues all three maybe
because my hair is like crazy my hard
drive is not my wreck computers not
recognizing my hard drive which is kind
of annoying so I can't really get the
footage because all my hard drives also
this noise so this morning at
like 8 o'clock in the morning honestly
maybe even earlier it happens like every
week they decide that like yeah I'm
going to like empty the garbage and it's
honestly the loudest thing ever heard
it's like it does if someone like I
don't know like dropped a whole truck on
the street
it's crazy loud and now they're
cutting them grass there's no grass down
there I don't know what they're cutting
honestly that's not that annoying -
what's annoying about this
recognizing probably doesn't get
recognized if I do stuff like that to it
but I went to see Jack Johnson last
night which there was some clips but
it's honestly really hard to film clips
at a concert cause like what is this -
like see but he was so good he was so
magical it's just so nice he like loves
the environment he liked me I Joey and I
couldn't get over the fact if he like we
were joking about the lanterns he had
these at lanterns strung and I was like
oh these are probably made from ocean
from the sea and then he has this like
net and I like we were just like kind of
making fun of it not like in a bad way
just like you know poking up someone
someone good like it'd be so him and
these I just wanted to let you guys know
that these lanterns in this over top are
made from plastic from this beach in
Hawaii and I was like I knew it I love
you jack pat end this vlog
really tiny things like eugenics
we closed on the bridal house
if you watch all my videos you would
have seen this already but I got my hair
done and she killed it exactly what I
wanted I just wanted to go back to
blonde but have it all kind of meshed
together so she even went down here and
it's just a beautiful neutral blonde
color I'm in love with it she did a
great job so as I said like a hundred
times I go to Anita loaning coaches at
biragi and Queen here in Toronto and
she's my favorite I love her I just put
a what i eated a video up um on a Sunday
because I didn't put any videos up last
week oh my god I just have such a busy
week and I really didn't have time to
film my hair is still looking good I
took it down so you could see uh I just
washed up for bed I have my lips
sleeping mask on and some zit cream on
and I have to go in for jury selection
tomorrow which is looking so annoying
like if this takes up my whole day I'm
literally screwed I have so much work to
do and it's just like jury selection yay
so I should get up super early expect to
be there for a 13 chiri solution I feel
like I only got chosen because I'm self
employed and they're like ah she doesn't
do anything so maybe I'll see you
tomorrow morning a jury selection I
thing so tired but jury duty and I
couldn't think of an outfit today so I'm
just wearing like jeans and a t-shirt
and there's leather jacket it's a coffee
and then jury
I'm home now that was a show this
morning like it's just so unorganized
and it just is insane to me about like
there's no better way well there is a
better way they just haven't implemented
it so I just film the video for you guys
that will be up it is Monday it'll be up
tomorrow I'm going to do all the things
for it now and put it up trying to get
more videos up for you guys we know I
did miss last week but it's just been
busy it's a hectic monsoon hectic month
wearing was really pretty taught from my
wrist swim which I got killed with
duties oh my god just like devastating
when it happens so that's the agenda
today and I probably won't tell anything
else because that was just my morning
and I wanted to show you guys how shitty
jury duty is but it's your civic duty
also um I just thought about what I eat
in a day and I kind of I don't know I
wanted to like tell you about today so I
had to get up really early I had no time
I got a coffee in the water in a banana
and now it's 12:30 and I still haven't
eaten so this is what not to do with
your body so I'm gonna have some lunch
now what I was what I'm trying to
explain is that every day is just so
different and you know sometimes you
have a great and healthy day and
sometimes you don't eat until 12:30 and
you're starving and your stomach's
making crazy noises so everyone has days
we're all human I just self tend because
I'm going my bikini video for you and I
got my Miss fresh hadn't gotten Miss
fresh and so long but I got in the mail
and I got some fun seems our Ted Bay so
I don't know just some food I love miss
fresh I'm gonna be you live by yourself
and you really have a lot of time to
grocery shop this rush is really great
and for me I I'm not sponsored by them I
just think it's a really it's like
chef's plate or there's a few of them
but I just really like the recipes on it
gives you three meals for like 60 bucks
which I get is expensive actually might
be cheaper than that but these meals
lost these two meals so I actually get
six meals for sixty dollars ten dollars
so specially not that bad and they're
really healthy and they can be all the
nutritional facts and all that good
stuff
yeah I'm just about to tell McKee video
have this crazy sit on my face I was
going to wait for it one bikini in the
mail but just going to
do an Instagram mama or something movies
her going to see fire to the Caribbean
Caribbean however my flies technically
gruesome probably the worst movie I've
ever seen
so did you like the movie it was
probably the worst thing they've ever
seen
well no monuments men I think is the
worst you've ever seen this is a close
second the point is we only see terrible
movies together it was bad I highly
recommend you don't do it you do get to
see Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom a
good first time in 50 years you could
just watch the first one if you want to
see that though the first one is
actually good I know but he doesn't look
as gross as he doesn't know in the first
one I know but the first movies like
they should just actually kept just the
first movie they're just not made at a
franchise when strangers hides is
 fantastic
and traps you cannot say anything about
a tutor coziest
oh you top it okay I gotta go good night
brought the IKEA pop-up right now wow
it's so fun
it is so cute this game would you rather
eat dessert first
now I would do now
and that
so random are you
meteor wow this is so cute it's really
great acid residue tricky Japan
Sophie
people
we were up pretty early this morning
it's around 8 o'clock right now is light
though like God we got up at 7 but ready
and now we're getting dropping Joey's
car off and then we're heading to a club
Monica walk through of their new vintage
collection ah yeah pretty tired last
night I put up an Instagram asking you
guys for travel tips because Joey and I
have decided to go to Paris and some
Tropez in September I put it up asking I
meant to ask like where we should go and
stay in those two places but I think I
wrote it as like where we should go we
have decided on those two places we have
a lot of other places I want to go with
is going to be our first resumee our
first solo trip together we've been
friends for a long time so we have been
to other places before like within a
Montreal before even in New York before
together but we with other people as
well it's my first solo trips will be
interesting but if you have any
suggestions for where to go and stay in
Paris and central pay that would be
great
specifically what neighborhoods to stay
in in Paris would be great looks like
well you feel like you know you know if
you want you mean suggestions you know
Mary
the last couple of days have been so
hectic it's been insane so I spoke on a
panel today which will insert some
footage here
I think we're never started walking they
want to learn I want to learn that you
can do your hair getting the word
examine is going to be to be usually
work and then the story communal action
or drop all channels people want you
need to be people want to walk there was
a people person
want to watch what I'm doing
remember is very not very common but not
a little I have this makeup on since
7:00 a.m. no seven 30s long exaggerated
and I'm like whoo so I have to go
shopping because I'm going to be at
generation Beauty tomorrow

over to cocktail party I am like beyond
exhausted so we're going to go for like
45 minutes have a drink so how do people
and then we're going to come home
get into bed eat dinner and watch a
movie and that's what I'm so excited for
Friday night and a lot of people were
you asked a lot of people are awesome
with this lip color is it is a Rimmel
lip liner with the Rimmel like lip thing
on top and then another lipstick on - I
know I mean I'll do a tutorial on it
because a lot of people asked about this
makeup look but yeah that's what's going
on right now
what are you gonna do when nobody shows
up this you don't really offered like
more awkward than you feel now
yeah I don't what's up with the way
you're sitting it's gonna be I feel like
if you were to be I feel like if you
were to be an animal you would be a
praying mantis
that's an insect
why are you trying to make me go broke I
live through breeding soft you stop I
got no money my bank
your feet hurt hello
okay rats fried
so I just got an eyelash tint and perm I
was going to blog the whole thing but I
didn't want to say that I was tell them
like oh can i vlog and then I hated it I
didn't want to like talk about it
but I do really like it um I keep
thinking that there's something in my
eye though but it looks really nice and
natural I got it because I absolutely
hate wearing mascara during the day and
I hate taking it off so this will let me
not worry about scared during the day
and also not look like a little boy and
so yeah it's pretty good all the makeup
around my eyes was taken off that's why
come-alongs weird right now but I really
like it
it was a lash tint in perm and I went to
be any room and I think Amanda did mine
it's like really it's lasted an hour
it's like super irritating process like
I really like so people touch my eyes
you least a few of my eyebrows plucked
and like it was super irritating for me
so I don't like that but I mean end
result is worth it lost that sixty eight
weeks and I'm still gonna put mascara on
when I go ahead and at night and stuff
but this is perfect for daytime it
really will bring down my beauty routine
at night and in the morning so I'm
really happy with it cost about a
hundred dollars like after tip and stuff
so the only thing is I keep feeling this
eyelash touch my eyeball right here and
I don't like that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
