birthday so I'm taking the L'Oreal True
Match in an free putting this all over
my face and then blending it out with my
Beauty Blender then I'm taking my next
concealer and cwo2
I believe and I am putting that under my
eyes and a triangle coordination and
then I will also be blending that I
would like the Wonder
now I'm taking one of the highlights
chains shades in the kat von d palette
and I am putting a lot a lot under my
eyes to kind of bake I didn't really
work properly but yeah just putting that
all under my eyes and on my chin as well
just to set everything and then I'm
getting this Lee's watch because contour
stick and I'm gonna contour my face I
really like this stick it's really great
then I'm blending out that contour with
my Beauty Blender of
now it's time for fake lashes so I'm
just taking this our Dell lash blue and
it's like a brush form and I'm putting
it on my actual eyes I find it way
easier to put lashes on like this if you
have a tube of lash glue you can just
put a little brush and then put it on
your eyes as well and then I'm taking
our dough whispies and Todd is my lashes
full of knives
then I'm taking a brown color from the
Kat Von D shade light palette and I'm
just putting that in the crease this I
just admitted like a really natural eye
and then I took a little bit of a darker
red or ready or shade and put it in the
outer corner I'm taking one of my
favorite highlights you jump by Rimmel
I'm just putting that in the inner
corner and a little bit of wash line to
make eyes right and then I am putting
the darker colors on the outer portion
of my eye
and then I'm taking a liquid liner and
just kind of blending me washes together
I mean I didn't really want to do a
liquid liner but I kind of had no choice
and now I'm just setting the contour
with the cap on the contour palette and
just setting all the cream contour that
I did then I'm taking this nyx sparkly
bronzer and putting that on my face and
then also kind of taking off the baking
that really didn't work this lighting
was really weird so I kept feeling like
my face was not right so I just put some
highlight on my nose and forehead to add
a little bit more dimension to the look
and then I'm taking my Maybelline Dream
bouncy blush on a stippling brush and
using that as my blush then I'm taking
this massive fluffy brush and blending
everything out so it looks you know find
it natural but it isn't then I'm taking
a girl lactic highlight and putting that
on - face down my nose
oh my keep it though Robin oh I can't
draw
editing this please watch a brow like
gel sort of thing and putting that on my
eyebrows to kind of fill them in kind of
keep them down I don't really need a
full filler with people a browser crazy
and then I'm just cleaning them up
making them look perfect then on the
other end of that eyebrow thing there's
like a highlight so I'm just putting
that on the top and outlining my
eyebrows and that make them look really
clean blending that out and then I put
my scare on and whipped caviar by NYX on
my lips as much as I did this quickly
but my boots are Steve Madden from Jimmy

obsessed with this dress bauble bar v
