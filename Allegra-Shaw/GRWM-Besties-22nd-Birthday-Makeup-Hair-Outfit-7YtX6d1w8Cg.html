ready with me and never do in terms of
get ready get ready with me but I
started getting ready really early stuff
this video would actually be good um
I am ready ready for Schwinns birthday
tonight she's turning 22 so we are just
going out and doing a big thing so this
is the hair and makeup I'll be wearing I
might throw my bangs up until I go like
one of these I'm really sure but by the
end of this video you'll see because the
outfit will be on
I'm also featuring these products the
Scandinavia primer and finishing spray
which are epic epic products and you'll
hear about them in the voice-over but
everything that you need to know with
these products we've also linked in the
down bar if you want to know how I get
ready just watch this video and I will
talk to you later bye starting with hair
I am just have a keeper tucked in and
I'm just curling my hair with a large
barrel curling iron and I'm going back
and forth and I'm leaving a bit out at
the ends to make it more wavy instead of
curly
after I've done a section I spray
hairspray I spray dry shampoo and then a
sea salt spray into my hands and I make
it all PC and more beachy waves than
nice curls and then doing the same thing
on the top section that I did in the
bottom section it's really the hair
spray the dry shampoo and the sea salt
spray that's really gonna give you the
look of the waves and kind of like PC
messy ways instead of just like you know
nice done curls I wanted to have a bit
more volume because this hairstyle had
to last like a really really long time
so I'm just teasing really messily not
in any particular order just the sides
and then the back as well
so I'm using the skinnin Avia primer
spray and this primer is a spray primer
which doesn't have a silicone base and
it gives you a semi matte finish instead
of you're making your face look slippery
so you can create this kind of stickier
base for your foundation to stick to all
night which is epic this is my makeup
loss at all night
it also helps prevent redness which I
need and uneven skin tones and large
pores but it also allows your skin to
breathe so this primer is absolutely
epic I'm next taking the loyal true
match foundation in w-4 and and for I
really screwed up my color so I'm just
gonna blending them like chemists to
make it my perfect skin tone and I'm
putting this on my face with a navy
blender then I'm taking anything just a
Revlon Colorstay concealer and putting
that on any red spots a little bit under
my eyes as well blending that out then
taking the benefit high beam and putting
this every single place that I want to
highlight my face or cheekbones under my
eyes nose forehead and I also do under
my contour as well
that highlight can take away some of the
coverage I'm just taking the Maybelline
instant age rewind concealer and putting
that around my eyes just to give me a
little bit more coverage and then taking
the nude stick in golden and using that
as my eye shadow and then they mean
stick an angel as my inner corner
highlight and I'm just blending that out
with my finger I'm then taking my
all-time favorite eyeshadow toast by
Bobbi Brown and putting that in my
crease this eye makeup look is really
really simple and I want to keep it that
way and then I'm taking a Rimmel
eyeshadow and putting that as my
highlight in my all my eyes and I'm
taking the Anastacio like highlighter
brow highlighter thing and just kind of
going around my eyebrows to make them
stand out I'm taking a black liner and
putting that on my tight line and I am
then doing a liquid liner small winged
liner like what I do all the time then
just a white eyeliner on my waterline
and the Bobbi Brown bronzer in natural
as my contour soft and gentle is my
highlight and L'Oreal telescopic mascara
as my mascara then I'm taking this no
color lip liner this is just about the
color that I'm gonna use doesn't bleed I
really love this idea I think it's
really great and then I'm taking
Vaseline and just putting that on my
lips as a base and then I'm gonna block
that off then I'm taking sin by Mac this
color is super super drawing so if you
just like put it on your lips your lips
look disgusting so I found a way to make
it work so I'm just taking it on a lip
brush and I just build the color kind of
sucks doesn't have to take out the brush
as well as the lipstick forever I'm now
finishing with the finishing spray this
takes away any powdery book that you
have on your face and makes your skin
look like skin gives your makeup amazing
staying power I was up until like 5 in
the morning my makeup still looked
flawless
and it really helps your concealer and
foundation not crease it's just an
incredible incredible product and my
makeup would not have lasted all night
without this my outfits my shirt is from
black dope my like white layer is just a
slip from the dress that I have and then
my shoes are Jeffrey Campbell just want
to keep it simple and pretty grungy but
it's kind of heat you know all right
that is all I'm sorry if you couldn't
really see a lot of what I was doing but
I was kind of in a rush
love you all thank you so much for
watching this video talk to you soon
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
