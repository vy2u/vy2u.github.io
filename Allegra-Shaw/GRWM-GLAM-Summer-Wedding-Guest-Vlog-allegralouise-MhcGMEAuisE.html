we're having breakfast brunch cafe
Canton very cute very early friendly
positions keynesian
all right so it's wedding prep this
video is obviously centering I'm getting
ready to be a wedding guest I'm very
excited I'm going to wedding in a while
I'm gonna show you what I order
breakfast because everyone was asking
about it it doesn't look as good as it
did I first left the house so wearing
this tank top I think this whole outfits
lecture dressed yet tank top for mithya
but literally get a white cami anywhere
and I'm wearing these wide leg slap
hands so they're really chic and like
comfy and I'm just wearing white
sneakers the perfect brunch outfit I
think we're going to make something very
similar to this for uncle because I
think it's to survive a lot so when it's
looking into making you I'd like swept
eggs I said I don't think these are
available anymore so a new thing I've
been trying out is instead of saying
something is like good or bad I'm saying
it's different so I'll never have a good
day or a bad day it's just every day's
different it's very similar so I
meditate every morning I don't know if
you know but you don't come out of a
meditation saying that was a good
meditation or that was a bad meditation
because I kind of just defeats the whole
purpose of meditating you come out of
the meditation just saying it is what it
is whatever happened happened and you
just move on there's no good or bad so
I'm starting to do it with days and I
think I like it so it's not like oh
today's a good day how could I made
today better it's just today was
different it was a different day today
today was different thing yesterday
today will be different than tomorrow
will be you know what I mean anyway I'm
going to the gym in 20 minutes
okay so just watch some inspirational
not inspirational just some like advice
videos from billionaires like Warren
Buffett Elon Musk I wasn't there Oprah
was in there that's what I was doing and
now I'm looking for headphones and we're
going to hit the gym I'm going to do
about half an hour of cardio 15 minutes
of ABS so I can get a nice 45 minute
workout in you can't find the headphones
and then I am going to come back and get
ready okay sorry I have my 35 on so it's
very close up to my face just showered

focus put this lawsuit mask on and to
the chill a little bit okay so I'm
getting ready for this wedding I have
done up nice Mountain shower and a shave
lotion my body so what I'm going to do
now is probably skin I'm going to use
the derma e vitamin C renewing
moisturizer it's okay it's like not my
favorite but all you does until it's
done
massage in my face a little bit get the
blood flowin I have this legs it here
really hurts but doesn't look like to be
too noticeable
and then skateable off camera of all of
this wedding they didn't so you have
those of the phone quality of their
authority I will by blog camera next
week and promise I'm mostly going to
take that indiscreet work at eye cream I
love this eye cream super hydrating I
use it in the morning I use it at night
oh just divine
for my list but then I'm also gonna put
on the glossy a priming moisturizer so I
want to finish it off and I want mine a
cup to last a long time so I'd be doing
a lot of priming steps feel me okay
she's good and then I'm actually going
about my hair's wet right now I'm
actually even wear my hair straight I'm
all through my viewfinder on the mirror
right now until I get my mirror to my
makeup so I don't I am sure you're a
longtime fan just like pretty new now I
know a lot of products to you but first
of it wouldn't be zoomed just one whole
kind of like a stranger this and then
I'll also go through my hair but it's
dry my hair is feeling kind of
straw-like right now they don't really
have like a very moisturizing
conditioner together it could definitely
put for my hair all right I'm going to
use this blow dry spray I think I
usually do idk one but personal like Rob
it's Brio do blow dry perfection and he
projected create a perfect so I don't
have to use a heap second you need put
that much in my hair I used to have this
product that would like help your hair
stay straight but I don't think I have
it here I think it's on my parents house
alright and I'm going to middle part my
hair but I'm a blow dryer okay so I have
one hour to you're ready qetsiyah what I
was doing watching inspirational videos
working out I guess
my bathroom is just a disaster usually I
clean up before I get ready but I didn't
so I'm using a dyson supersonic
hairdryer
I love the term to our talking about
before it's the best and I have often
diffuser with it or when I have my hair
natural god it's amazing
first I'm going to use this and then you
need to get a brush simulated straight
but I'm going to get a little more
something to use probably the high heat
settings on your privacy setting and
seconds
using the wet brush brush up my hair
come back to blow dry Oh where's my so
that's a lot of wood right earth grades
I had to put a peg top on because I was
lucky very hands full upper lip is
sweating gross

decay quick fix prime missing told you a
lot of priming we have to what my Beauty
Blender look at this she put like a
marker on my water and the markers not

colonization of growth we should see my
bathroom right now I'm using the Giorgio
Armani luminous silk foundation in 6.5

I did use a beauty blender to blend this
out

always like to later but he is perfect
pretty excited this wedding - wedding in
a very long time
my dress is like kind of flowery and
submarine so I'm definitely thinking
like a summery makeup very like light
kind of like a pink on the eye maybe
something along those ones and you want
the street full coverage so I'm going to
add symbol up just try my chin area
there's literally nothing on my for
bringing it down neck ears I love this
foundation place I would say it's full
coverage it know if it's done right full
coverage foundation but it just having
the most beautiful luminous sheen to it
how this zit on my face though
oh my god I should have put a color
corrector underneath - a gun - nice well
babe I hate things that don't have like
a whole counter what do I do
sorry should be complaining and a
beautiful present alright so next I am
going to use the Kat Von D lock-it
concealer which is my new favorite this
is in light 15 neutral this concealer

know why it is more hyped
and you can like it's just amazing build
it up if you want you can wear it more
natural
okay blend this out yeah I'm like
obsessed with concealer I wish our chart

talked about way more it's amazing scent

difficult sometimes so funny I had lunch
my job the other day he's like my
eyelashes very curly what did you do
dollars as much as that had no idea of
the thing so cute
okay other eye Oh like just stunning I'm
putting in that concealer unlike my eye
base so I'm just going to dab a bit on
my finger and I'm going to put on my
eyelids just cuz I can really get on my
eyelids when we blender and the I'll
shoot some shows
so it's a very long video thanks for
sticking around
I just like the way those two feel on my
face like I don't really feel like I
have that much makeup oh I'm going to
set no no no no no everything that you
set my under eyes because I'll be
wearing this makeup for a very long time
and I'm going to sort of the laura
mercier secret brightening powder and
then mystics brush and set the lid the
nice base for the eyeshadow I can't see
anything

mineral powder le like this one too much
like it's night it's just not for any
guys it's going to set all over to make
little acne slots okay I'm back
alright so okay so what I'm going to do
start the crease I'm doing something
very light you know me kind of natural
I'm going to go with the lorac Pro
palette I'm going to take the color
canvas just a canvas color and with this
all over the base or the eyeshadow
literally let's go now we're going to
put the crease color you know I'm going
to take this color here I know you can't
really see but I don't Rosie ones right
now this is like an informal get ready
with me I was doing it after but just is
like pretty pink color in the crease
going very well so far I like it a lot
good job good should legs and I heard
some makeup registration always do your
crease color with your eye open because
your crease changes if your eyes closed
very pretty
adding some more to this side losing
some eyelashes okay pretty I love them
going to do something I'm like yes
annuities are free and a couple times
nearly why did I sell our way put on
eyeshadow quick

pearl color a little short cut free to
put on a flat shader brush and really
pack it on
I can't see anything it was great
now I'm going to take it go back and get
the crease color and just blend it all
together there's no harsh line in
between the lid and the crease I'm just
like I do just love that two-tone but
maybe darken it up a little bit going to
go with a brush it's a little bit more
condensed and I just need like a darker
pink or something yeah I'm gonna go in
about a regional car that I didn't want
to do in the crease of this color here
darker pink with a little bit of shimmer
but not too much on this more condensed
brush just putting on the top tapping
off excess and I'm going to really focus
to tell me other corner also that paint
marker I'm talking if I was talking
about earlier yeah it got a little right
very expensive Westone that's why people
it'll come off because the colors not
doing much
Oh cat sock so not working with
it if it's are going to use this six
left on the end of my brush and that's
see if this works
