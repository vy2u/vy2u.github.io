day 15 I think
oh yeah 15 um I it's been 8 a.m. which I
never goes really anymore well like yeah
I never really a mystery anymore um but
it's about 8 a.m. and I am making some
coffee and I'm getting ready I'm going
to meditate and do a lot of fun stuff
because I believe at 8:45 to hit a
knitting mill so I got back from the
knitting mill which was so cool I'm like
a factory or anything it's like
factories are just so cool and it was
just crazy like the Knitting Mills where
they actually take the thread and make
it into the fabric insane um also crazy
it's how many annoying people that are
out in the world like the my winter
lookbook thing like how many people
commented either something about me
being my bro on underwear which like
 get over it and like why do you
want to show off your body like
literally obviously you missed the whole
point of the video or people who are
like this is so not winter when I give a
nice explanation in the beginning of the
video about where I live what my
lifestyle is why these outfits work for
me honestly people are just so annoyed
so right now I'm working on a video an
out video for like freezing cold weather
and snow I'm just writing down outfits
for that I would never come at negative
 on someone's video I want to show
you something so Canadian okay first of
all this is not what I want to show you
but I'm going to put this hat on because
freezing outside
and I'm going to go put my winter winter
coat on because what's going on I was
gonna walk to a store but I want to show
you I want to show you why I'm not going
doesn't look like anything right
all right actually isn't that bad
looked way scarier on the inside but
still snowy and cold and I am NOT going
a blood knot bull
probably not way out either because I
want to stand and be warm every time I
say I'm not going yet I like going up
it's actually pretty bad now
what with alchemy is all covered in snow
happy vlogmas day 16
maybe um I'm down here in the uncle
warehouse which is just this little
Locker and we keep everything in there
sealed boxes by size I guess I'll show
you so those are actually hoodies I'm
donating to a women's shelter they're
just blanks and I thought it'd be nice
to donate these are just the sizes and
keep our in there we're actually
dropping something pretty huge today we
don't pick three t-shirts so when I grab
those they're gonna drop by the time you
see this video they'll have been dropped
already which is pretty exciting okay
okay I have my 35 millimeter lens on
that's why it's so close up on my face
because I want to take it Instagram
picture
but lenses with me so I'm going to vlog
and try to hold it out but usually hard
to focus and hold it out very cuz all
folks on this last way too loud so
handing out those want to show everyone
that's really cool Candida right now and
I'm wearing
I just went to Starbucks and I got this
like protein box I'm starving and I got
a mocha made with soy milk I'm supposed
to go to the embroiders to pick up some
stuff right now but traffic is so so bad
it's crazy like I live in Canada and
it's knoweth every single year but as
soon as this knows everyone forgets I
Drive crazy so I think I'm just gonna go
home and finish up what I need to do and
then hit the gym I have a film last two
days really I've literally just been
working and not filming so I think I'm
gonna fall myself get ready sort of like
I'm not gonna film but myself poetron my
hair or anything but I'm seeing a little
bit out of this road so my original plan
was just put music to this but you can't
see the products I'm using so first
using Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer
and the first yeah and then the L'Oreal
True Match I'm putting those together to
create do we finish that is the same
like this controller that I needed and
then I blended it with a very damp
Beauty Blender concealer I use the
Maybelline instant age rewind concealer
and then blend that out
here I'm using the essence eye shadow
primer and I actually really like this
stuff and it's super super inexpensive
like a dollar and I am then just
covering up that's it with some powder
and some concealer then taking the laura
mercier translucent powder and i'm
putting that all over my face
and then like directing in certain areas
that i need it and then I'm using ish
cosmetics contour palette been loving
this ish contour and light/medium kits
so good so I'm using the matte contour
shade from that palette using a contour
then taking the hoola bronzer by benefit
to warm everything up and then taking my
exposed blush and using that and then
for the eyes and TuneIn like that new
highlight much fish palette and using
that on my lids I'm then just doing some
I stuff like creating wing I like that
stuff for my eyebrows
and I honestly don't remember fixing my
eyes and putting some more highlight on
them and then I am taking the chart
exposed highlights and I am violating my
face and then I go in with the itch
prosthetics highlights as well and I
highlight my face this won't feel like
very very glowy and then ellipse I wore
the nude lip liner from NYX and Rimmel
Kate number 45
okay I am done my makeup just wanted to
show you what I was wearing out tonight
quickly I'll probably Instagram it so
you'll see but Wayne's crop top or the
crop sweater some fishnet underneath my
mom jeans and then some booty things the
outfit homies see you tonight</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
