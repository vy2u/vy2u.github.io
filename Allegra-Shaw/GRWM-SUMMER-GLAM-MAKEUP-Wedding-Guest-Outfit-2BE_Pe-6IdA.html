go back from New York last night and Jen
from V left and just came over to tan me
I just got like a darker glow she
actually came on Monday she came and
gave me like a nice natural glow for New
York and then she came today and gave me
a darker glow for the wedding so it's
really great cuz she's comes to your
house you can like just wear a robe and
chill so I will link her Instagram down
below so I ordered an orange dress if
you saw my Instagram stories I had like
a vote on my story about what dress to
wear so I got the orange one and I
ordered a size too small I ordered a
zero instead of a two couldn't breathe
in the zero
my friends at borrow it in Toronto I
liked messages I'm really late last
night and that's like I need a dress for
tomorrow so I'm going in to them to get
a dress for tonight so I am heading out
to grab a dress I hate going out with a
spray tan you have no idea like it just
looks so God do it you gotta do I'm just
wearing like really loose clothing I'm
gonna throw on my vans okay let's go
let's go oh my basically what borrow it
is is a Toronto startup and you can like
rent dresses from them so great
sustainable way to get a new outfit for
an event actually like lend your dresses
to them and then they'll have them on
their roster and then when they get lent
oh you get paid and honestly like who
wants to spend hundreds and hundreds of
dollars on different
dresses for wedding season this is like
a great way to get a new outfit for
every event that you have
so I'm gonna start getting ready for the
wedding now because it's our friends
sister's wedding
Joey's wonderful wedding and I am going
to be like after part like party part
with all my friends so yeah now before I
start anything I have known that this
wedding is coming up obviously so I've
been I'm in the middle of a teeth
whitening cycle and I'm gonna use the
crest 3d white Whitestrips with light
you guys know about these I've talked
about the bunch of my channel and crest
is sponsoring and collaborating with me
on this video so thank you guys very
much this is a video I wanted to do
anyway I wanted to get ready with you
guys for the wedding basically with
these you just pop them on and the
results can last up to 36 months and
it's just like a 10-day kind of cycle
and taking the top strip and the baggage
strip you're getting intimate I'm just
gonna leave those on while I do my
makeup I think that's like the easiest
way to use them so yeah they're on white
teeth are super important to me to make
me feel super confident and I feel the
most confident when I smile as bright
and the light you guys know this end if
you want more information on what I do
to keep my teeth white you can click the
link in the iCard is up here and I will
take you to my full teeth whitening and
video so check that out if you want to
learn how to get a wide smile and yes I
am coming back to you from sitting on my
toilet just the best lighting for makeup
I don't know first things first we're
priming the face with the Smashbox photo
finish primer okay for foundation I kind
of want to use just like like the Juice
Beauty kind of feeling that I also oh
it's looks so light so I'm gonna use the
Giorgio Armani luminous silk foundation
in the color 5.5 with the a cosmetics
brush on the website this looks so dark
and then impersonal if so light then you
squeeze it out of the bottle it looks
fine so weird actually a really nice
color it's like the perfect color for me
I'm like not at the age yet we're after
what a wedding is all the time I usually
have like maybe one summer and it's
usually like friends sisters or brothers
getting married but I feel like in the
next like two three years this one I'm
gonna be up at age we have to go to like
25 weddings
per summer but I feel like I don't know
if you guys feel the same like I do
watch a lot of YouTube it's like why I
started YouTube because I loved it and
because I actually watch it it's like
what I do in my spare time and I feel
like every youtuber right now is like
getting pregnant it's pretty crazy but
that's probably it's because I've always
watched youtubers that are like two
years older than me and now they're all
in that life stage I want to go with
like a really natural look but the full
coverage is just calling my name so I'm
doing the short arc shape tape under my
eyes and then my skin is so good right
now
it's like making my life just blending
that out I like to blend out the edges
with the brush and then I could usually
go in with my finger so that it kind of
melts in my camera's gonna die you have
a group chat going for the wedding and
it's just like blowing up right now dude
I mean like when you use your finger it
just kind of like melts in it looks a
little more natural I'm pretty sure I
just thought concealer right in my
eyeball I actually went with a really
natural nail look because I really do
play getting my nails done so I just
painted them clear and I've been liking
that natural kind of look I guess I like
that like every summer can you believe
that I don't have to conceal any spots
oh that's like so not like me I'm gonna
set with my glossier brush and my Laura
Mercier translucent powder just setting
the face part with this I set up right
now is so not professional then I'm
gonna take the little one the eye powder
I am going to charge this and then I'm
gonna let these sit when I get back I
will do the light okay that break laughs
it way longer than expected okay
an hour after so I'm taking the lights
and we're gonna get the top one first
feed you the top and the bottom and now
the bottom okay I think I'll you can
literally see the difference like he
looks so right it's insane first I'm
gonna take the lorac Pro palette I don't
know one this Oh number three and I'm
gonna put on just the canvas color here
I just think this is a nice base to
start with while I decide what I
actually want to do with my eyes cuz I'm
actually not too sure I'm wearing a red
jumpsuit okay so now I'm gonna take
sidecar from The Naked palette good old
Naked palette what a throwback honestly
this is such a good palette like out of
all the naked palettes that's definitely
my favorite and one of my favorite
palettes like I just have in general I
think it has the most beautiful colors
in it and just perfect easy to travel
with
so sidecar is like a very light brown
color I'm just gonna put that on the
lids this fluffy brush here and I'm
gonna take from The Naked palette again
actually you know what I'm gonna take
this color medallion from the lorac Pro
palette and I'm just gonna lightly dust
this on the inner corner inner part of
the eye but all the sparkle that we're
going to use we're gonna use on like a
fluffier brush so it's not too too
intense I just want that like kind of
wash of color and then I'm gonna go in
with a sidecar now so sidecar I'm just
taking a generous amount on this fluffy
brush and I'm just dusting it along the
eyes and I think it creates like this is
one of my favorite looks because it
creates like the most stunning finish
like it's like a nice beautiful brown
Sheen who cest and I wanted to be kind
of messy you know I like messy but not
perfect I wanted to kind of look like
it's a part of my eye like my eyes have
a natural shimmer on it my dad is just
sending me videos of Chloe like I don't
love Chloe as much as you do he's
obsessed with her
and I think she's cute but I don't need
videos like every two seconds so I just
think that creates like literally the
most beautiful shrine ever now I'm gonna
go back in with a lighter one this is
medallion oh you know what I'm gonna mix
it uh almond pearl with medallion and
I'm gonna go in the inner corners here I
know like if you don't film YouTube
videos you know how annoying this is
like you're gonna be quiet all day and
then as soon as you sit down to film a
video like I don't know if you can hear
that but everyone is messaging you I'm
gonna go in with this blonde color mix
it with canvas here and I'm gonna do
this under the brow I just kind of
brighten it up just think it makes my
eyebrows look a lot cleaner but then I'm
going back in the sidecar a little bit
and kind of blending it I'm gonna finish
up the eyes after I finish everything
else I don't want to do a few more
things like touch them up but I have the
had the basic like idea we're keeping it
pretty natural like usual okay I have to
answer my dad cuz he's going crazy
okay this soleil 10 de Chanel is like my
favorite thing ever and I was actually
just in New York talking at Estee
Lalonde who is the sweetest human in the
whole world
I'm like I love her we were talking I
asked her what it was on her face and
she's like oh I have this show that it's
the Chanel Soleil tan on oh my god me
too I brought it she's like yeah that's
an intent it's a test to you like how
much I actually like the product cuz
it's huge and if you want to travel with
this that means you obviously really
like it I'm just gonna warm my face up a
little bit brush is really really
shedding me that it gets all in the
product and I have to pick it out so
just putting late
coats on and then building it up and you
had thinks I'm at the wedding right now
and he still doesn't care he's still
just going at it with the texting and
then under the jaw to create that nice
jawline
because the foundation look a little
washed out
gonna add some to my nose area which I
know a lot of people don't do but I have
like the tiniest nose ever so I don't
contour so I'm just gonna add some tan
kind of around this area using hoola to
set the bronzer this doesn't even really
need setting but since I'm literally
gonna be wearing this for like 10 hours
setting it it's just like an extra step
have you guys heard the new the yodeling
kids song I honestly kind of wake I
still really like country music so I can
still get into it and I honest you
really like his song I gotta get so
funny is it like all the year what does
he say something like all the things
I've been dreaming about like for my
whole life like you only been cognizant
for maybe four years I think how old are
you 7 no I'm gonna do blush I bought
tart exposed you guys know that I used
to just this is the only blush I used to
use and it was the VI nice sale so I got
I can't open it so I bought it such a
good color it's such a good color and I
just think it matches every single
makeup look ever this is definitely like
an all-time food for me I also the day
the night before I left for LA I dropped
my 20 Beauty Universal red on the ground
in my bathroom and it went everywhere
like it looked like an actual crime
scene and y'all heard that his take it
off oh my god it was such a nightmare
and I was like in the middle of packing
and I had to get up so early and I'm so
sad is I really really wanted to wear
that tonight such a good read but I'm
sure I have something else I can play
with okay I think I just put on way too
much blush whatever so I was gonna take
the naked color from The Naked palette
and just put that right under the eye to
kind of you know bring it together I'm
gonna take a little bit of the sidecar
the sparkly color I've got right to the
center bottom and then I'm also going to
add that to the under under corner
okay I need literally everyone I think
I'd say that like maybe ten times a day
and you never want to stop bothering me
then what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go
back to the lorac Pro palette I'm gonna
take the cool taupe color on this angled
brush and I'm gonna create a really soft
wing I just personally like this you
could add a winged liner if you wanted
but I just like something really soft I
might actually need something a bit
darker sorry I'm actually gonna take the
dark brown color that's right there and
I'm gonna use that because the other one
was just a little too light
I mean doesn't do like that much but
just for someone like me who doesn't who
I have a more like roundish eye and I
really like almond eyes know that I
don't like my eyes I'm not saying that I
just make my eyes a little bit longer
that's it okay um I like to add
highlight after I set so I'm gonna set
my face with the Urban Decay all nighter
setting spray anyone
Mar their two lids as anyone has anyone
figured out why there's two woods yet
that's a good stuff
what highlight not that you guys can
vote but not the tarte exposed highlight
which you know is tried and true and I
love it and I wear it all time I
actually just ran out of it in Miami I
think or LA so this is a more gold
highlight like that but I also had a
smell that smells delicious right if it
dandelion highlight I think I'm gonna
try this one and if I don't like it us
on this on top because I've never had
some for more of a highlight brush damn
this brush that comes with it which I
usually do but I don't know highlight
brush around me and I'm linked in a
little contraption she made processor
here okay so let's try this so it
doesn't look like it sticks to the brush
that well that's not a good sign okay
what's nice very natural like not not an
intense highlight at all could be dis
brush can you see can you see that it
gives a pretty glow it's gonna add
something here to down the bridge of the
nose always I just had panic attack oh
my god I think my camera stopped
recording but like I didn't know where
so anyway and then I'm gonna put some of
my finger and do my lip anyway I'm
actually gonna set this one more time
because that was very powdery know when
that dries we're going in with mascara
and you guys know well telescopic okay
so this is it for makeup I am gonna
light a little color but I want to get
dressed and stuff before I do that so I
will come back to you and I want to add
a little color okay so I put my red
jumpsuit on and I actually think I'm
just gonna wear my hair in a ponytail
I'm like kind of like you need to see
how the back looks but I think that this
looks really nice and then it's an open
Mac dress so did having your hair up is
nice so what I'm gonna do it's got some
hairspray I'm also also gonna add some
of this like windblown stuff I find it
makes my bangs look good in the end it's
not my wedding so who really cares how I
look right okay and here is the finished
makeup and hair look I really like it I
actually turned out way better than
expected wearing like three different
red lip colors right now but I highly
recommend you just check out the Fenty
Beauty Universal red if you want a go-to
lip color but I just like mix it bunch
together to create this hair and then
I'm going to jumpsuit I'm gonna try to
get a better photo of my jumpsuit and
outfit hopefully there's good lighting
it's somewhere but I really am happy
with the way this makeup turned out yay
well of law exception just when you
think you've seen it all they think of a
blog section said I lose out Wi-Fi
