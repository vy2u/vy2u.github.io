I do this
sultry going out makeup I wear this
makeup look all the time now it's my
favorite going out makeup it's like
still natural but it just like gives you
that sultry kind of looks so the first
thing gonna do is start off with the
osya
protect atmosphere protection cream at
all of my face and then the vitamin C
primer from the body shop and then this
Scandinavia primer as well for
foundation I'm using the Clinique
concealer plus foundation anything
neutral everything will be linked down
below and then i'm also using the
l'oreal true match in and four just to
get the perfect color and then I'm gonna
blend that out with my damn Beauty
Blender
then I'm taking the NARS radiant creamy
concealer in the shade honey and putting
that under my eyes on any blemishes on
my forehead and any places like that and
then I'm taking my damp Beauty Blender
and blending that out as well I'm taking
new Laura Mercier translucent powder on
a wedge sponge and I'm baking this under
my eyes so I'm just putting a water
under my eyes and then I'm putting some
on a big fluffy brush and just doing the
rest of my face as well and I'm taking
the shade and light palette by Kat Von D
and I'm taking this little tiny angled
brush and I think the middle color in
the palette and I'm just contouring my
face just under the cheekbones and then
I do the sides of my face to make my
face not so round and then I'm just
blending that out with a larger angled
brush then taking the benefit hoola
bronzer on a large angled brush
face it up a little bit and then I'm
gonna take a round fluffy brush and wipe
away making taking this essence
eyeshadow primer and putting that on my
eyelids and then I'm gonna go to and go
in with the Kat Von D shade and light
palette the yellowy color and I'm gonna
set the eyelids with that color then I'm
taking the lighter color and putting
that under my eyes just kind of brighten
everything up blending everything
together I'm all about the blending okay
let's start so I'm taking the natural
kind of color in the shade and light
palette and I'm using this as a
transition color so I'm gonna put that
in my crease I'm going with the lightest
Brown and going over that just blending
and putting it my crease and also on the
outer corner and I'm just gonna continue
to put a little bit of product on and
blend it out a little bit of product
blend it out and just continue that
process until it's as dark as I want it
to be then I'm going with the darker
Brown and a putting out on the outer
corner and just again blending it out
just doing it until I'm happy I'm taking
a clean blending brush and that's how
I'm gonna blend everything out I really
just go in there and blend it out so
it's just the smooth kind of transition
and then I'm still taking the brown
color here
I'm taking this like shimmery ash
whitish color and putting out on the
lids really like this color I think it's
a great lid color and then I'm taking a
whiter color and putting on the
highlight everything will be linked down
below and everything and then putting
the lightest Brown underneath my eyes to
you know bring everything together and
then just continue to blend make sure
it's all seamless and beautiful
you could add a liquid liner if you
wanted but I'm not really about that
life so I'm taking the Tarte exposed
blush and putting that on my cheeks I
love this blush it's just a pretty color
and just blending it out and then I'm
taking the Tarte exposed highlight on a
damp duo fiber brush and I'm using that
as my highlight on my cheekbones on my
foreheads down my nose and on my Cupid's
bow so I'm adding a coverfx stick on my
waterline and then also adding a Stila
black eyeliner on my tight line you can
do liquid liner if you wanted to just
really both that you could also do
falsies if you wanted to and then I'm
adding in essence eyeshadow and
snowflake on the inner corners and then
mascara this is the L'Oreal telescopic
mascara and I'm just putting a ton of
coats on to make my eyelashes really
long and dramatic but I think falsies
would look nice with this look I just
I'm not about that faulty light then I'm
taking the Tarte exposed lip thing I
don't know what these are called but
tart exposed and then I'm taking a lip
gloss in so cute it's the Kylie Jenner
lip gloss I love this combo together
just using that and then you're done
that's all you need to do add some
finishing spray to make the makeup last
all night and yeah that's it
