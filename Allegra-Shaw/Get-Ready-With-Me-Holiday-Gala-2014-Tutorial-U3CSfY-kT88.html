holiday gala 2014 I first used to prep
and pine by Mac and now I'm using
Revlon's I believe me thing that I
really love is the next thing I think
foundations the Loreal magically the
Oriole like powder or liquid the powder
in real liquid to powder one and that's
all I mix together and then I just put
that all over my face with a stippling
brush next i'm taking the I think it's
L'Oreal what I feel like everything is
L'Oreal I don't know but I'm taking I
think that's L'Oreal perfect match
you're this perfect match and the Kat
Von D concealer put it under my eyes and
on any
then taking a translucent powder I'm
using the Marsala one I'm sure you guys
get better ones but just taking a large
bouquet like brush to clean that oldest
face and then I am taking a smaller
fluffy brush and just putting that in
smaller areas that need it
then I take hoola by benefit and I'm
going to contour my face with a bronzer
and then I take Matt's forgot me
princess by heart wait I think that's
right
chart and I just blends all out I
remember taking dollars by benefit and
using cause my blush next taking the mac
mineralize skinfinish in soft gentle
using that as my highlight I'm doing my
eyebrows I'd never really did my
eyebrows so this is just like a brown
eye shadow that I have and I'm just time
ago one in my brows me a little more
defined
then I'm taking the benefit brow-lift
pencils out wanting my entire high brow
and then I'm black on it
mundane is mainly palate I don't know
what it's all about put it down below
and taking the lightest shade and
putting that all over my lid and I'm
gonna teach some covergirl eyeshadow
it's like white eyeshadow and then we
have exactly the top of my lid all the
names will be in the downbar and then
taking the light brown shade from Kat
Von D College and putting that into my
crease and just keeping a pretty natural
for the eyes then lining my tight line
and I'm going to use a liquid eyeliner
for the Stila liquid eyeliner
on to my hair I am just curling my hair
with the large curling iron and because
I get a 1 and a half it's just too
interesting it's one of the big bear
watch and I'm just curling my entire
head away from my face
I don't think I end up showing it but to
pull the look together I use these
access finishing spray as hairspray so
now on to lips I'm taking mac rebel and
a small brush and outlining my lips
we're gonna line my lips this way and
then I'm just gonna put it all over
and that is it for hair and makeup
the dress and armbands are from SAPO
skirt my bag is from Rebecca Minkoff and
my shoes are Steve Madden hope you guys
