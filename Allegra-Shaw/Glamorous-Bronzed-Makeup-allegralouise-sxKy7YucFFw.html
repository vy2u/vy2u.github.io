look summery like tan bronzed glamorous
makeup look haven't done a glamorous
makeup look in a really long time so I
want you that got crazy glam makeup look
for you I wore this eye to an event and
it looked beautiful so I wanted to share
with you guys hope you guys enjoy this
video and if you want to find out how to
just creates look keep watching and for
my hair I literally just curled it so
just like with I have tons of videos my
curly hair keep watching
let's this party started so I'm gonna do
the eyes first um I'm gonna take a bit
of concealer and put that on my lids
because I don't actually have any
eyeshadow primer right now that should
suffice
okay so I'm first going to take a
half-baked from The Naked palette I'm
gonna put this on the lid but more the
inner inner part of the lid
then I'm going to take smog in The Naked
palette as well and I'm going to put
that pack on the outer corner of the lid
that kind of hits the crease so it's
going to take a clean brush and blend
then in the Naked palette I'm going to
take Dark Horse let's start to really
darken it up
I'm gonna go back in with smog and bring
it in a little further like this
blending brush again blending that it
slightly now I'm gonna go in with a
matte brown shade I'm gonna go in with
the color latinus from the kat von d
palette and then I'm gonna take dark
horse again blending it just so that
side is dark in that blending brush then
in the NYC lavada stemi Lovato palette
I'm gonna take the color six the sixth
color it's like a shimmery sort of
coppery color and I'm gonna put that
right in the middle of the eye then
taking from the kat von d palette the
color sim Mouse it's just like a
highlight ish color like a skin color
color and that right under the brow and
at the q-tip I'm just gonna clean up
this line and any fallout so for the
face I use this vitamin C skin boost
instant smoother by the body shop and
just put that all over my these
daughters now I'm taking the Clinique
beyond perfecting foundation concealer
with a damp Beauty Blender I'm gonna
blend this out
and then taking the next concealer in
cw3 so to said I'm going to use the
shade and light contour palette gonna
set underneath my eyes I highly don't
recommend this resetting underneath your
eyes because it does crease I was just
the laura mercier secret brightening
power a translucent powder to set I just
don't have it right now so I'm just
taking the yellowy color from this
palette and setting it really does
crease though and then I'm taking the
peachy color and I'm just gonna go over
any places I have blemishes
okay now let's contour so I'm going to
take the shade in my contour palette
again and I'm going to take the cool
shade and the second warm shade like I
just kind of mix them together and I'm
going to contour it
then I am taking blue bronzer beep
bronzer brush not a lot but I just want
to kind of blend it all out this I'm
gonna take that shade light contour
palette again and I'm gonna take that
yellow color and I'm gonna put that
right under my contour in like like a
lot of it like almost like baking well
kind of exactly like baking actually
wedge sponges are very good for this I'm
then I'm gonna go in with the color that
we put in the crease and I'm gonna put
that right under the eyes take my Beauty
Blender cleaning it up and then I'm
gonna go in and I'm gonna take a
half-baked which is the lid color and
I'm gonna put that right on the bottom
the center now it's gonna take a big
fluffy brush I'm just gonna wipe off
that baking I'm gonna go back in and
just fix up finish up the eyes and then
we can finish it with me so now that
you're up close and personal again what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take a brown
liquid liner this is the LEAs watch a
brown I'm gonna do a very thin line I
don't want it to be super dramatic or
anything not even really winging it out
just like just do it on the top then I'm
gonna go in with this tease cosmetics
cloud9 eyeliner and it's just like
bronze bull it's called bronze glaze so
it's like a bronzy color it's really
pretty and I'm gonna put right over the
brown and then you can add a falsies I
think I'm actually gonna add falsies
just the very new for me I never add
falsies these are the our del W ESPYs
I'm so about putting cold flashes long
I'm actually I'm bad at putting false
eyelashes on I just don't think I have
good glue so you guys know the best
eyelash glue I need to know all right
heroes nothing
I think I nailed that okay so I'm just
gonna add some like skin color like my
skin color the waterlines is a cover
effect stick I love this stick get also
out of brown I just I like to keep that
I'm pretty bright and then I'm gonna add
sin black to the top and then some
mascara who wants to watch someone put
my scare on in a video because I don't
okay back to the face I'm just gonna add
some blush I'm adding these the Rimmel
London blush in live pink and then
highlight the news the girl arctic so I
think our lactic highlight in lustre I
really use don't we like button my lady
shampoo pop if I owned it but I don't
so we're just taking this duo fiber
brush I've been liking putting a
highlight on with this brush lately
because it kind of makes it a little
more natural and literally face is done
so let's do lips for lips I'm going to
use the dose of color in sand yeah what
I find works best of us if you do it I
go very very thin thin layer and I'm
gonna use the Kylie Jenner lip gloss in
so cute I like this look also just find
this better if you have a base so you
could use like concealer or something
but it's just really hard to like hide
your lip color with this it's not like
sheer enough to just put on so I like to
like such a good face okay so this is
the finished makeup look I hope you guys
enjoyed it it's really pretty and it's a
lot of makeup but sometimes it's just
nice to like go ahead and feel super
glam I also haven't done like a super
glam look in a really long time so hope
