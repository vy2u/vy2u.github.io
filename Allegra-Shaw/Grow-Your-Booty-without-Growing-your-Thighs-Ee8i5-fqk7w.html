routine I am wearing the work I've
talked to go with this video I am NOT
going to work out after how I just
thought up this week go with the theme
today I'm going to show you my lower
body workout so this is my quick
primarily my glutes I don't really work
out a lot of other muscles in my legs
because my legs are pretty toned any
crowing my whole life so I pretty big
calves already and I don't want my quads
and my I know my thighs it's basically
to get bigger
I'm a foodie a figure and my thighs are
kind of saved today they're really
focused all of my workouts on my bleep I
work my visit two to three times a week
depending on how I feel I really have to
listen to my body and then the days off
I work my upper body or just cardio and
abs so that's kind of how I structure my
workout I work out three to five times a
week and I am a busy I am so I'm just
going to talk you through my workout I
often include how much weight I put on
things because you as a human need to
listen to your own body and how much
weight I put on things isn't going to be
how much weight you should put on things
I don't make any of every workout I warm
up so my warmup is I walk on an incline
at the highest levels of treadmill goes
most of them are 15 and I walk at 3.6
3.7 and I go for about 15 to 20 minutes
and I am like sweating by the end of
this I really feel it I feel tired
I like pumping away I'm sweating you
know I really go for it so this workout
and burns a lot of calories and I really
like it I'm not a great runner so I
don't really like running for swinging
Fritz machines and I hate it so I love
walking on it incline the Stairmaster is
always a good one too but this is like
my favorite my go-to and I think it
burns a lot of calories so and then for
it so it's over 15 to 20 minutes and
then after that I go into stretching I
stretch
my body is warm I always start my
stretching with rolling out I roll out
my box both my upper back because my
natural posture is me punching and I
hate that and trying to avoid a
hunchback so I always roll up my upper
back rolling out your chest also can
help with that and I roll out of the
foam roller and then you really want to
get in the muscles of getting a lacrosse
ball rolling out here rolling out parts
of your box really get deep into tissue
um so all of my back I stretch out my
legs I was really tight in this video
you know it's worked in my legs like a
few days ago for so it's really tight I
roll out my legs stretch my little
sister from hamstrings I stretch my back
like I really try to stretch I really
try to stretch out my body the first
workout is hip abduction I really like
this workout I trying to grow my hip
school but if you have some so jealous
I have no hip hip I've no hip bone and
you can't really change that so I try to
make my booty wider to make like look
like I have hips so I do three sets of
these at ten around ten to twelve reps
the weight varies I think I'm usually
around eighty eighty pounds but you have
to listen to your own body and do how
much weight that you think that you can
do I've been really into the cable
machine lately so this is kind of like a
donkey kick but on the cable machine so
like a table kick back and I just use
they have the ankle strap but I don't
really like using an ankle strap for
these I feel like we don't have as much
control as to where I can squeeze so I
use the like fabric cold attachment for
the cable strap and I just put it onto
my foot and I keep back I do about 20
pounds on these again listen to your own
body it's okay if you can only do five
pounds and it's okay if you just want to
use an ankle weight and do it on if you
like to talk to common ground I just
first name it likely me lately so I do
10 reps each leg three sets each leg and
then next I do the same like hip
abduction on the cable machine it kind
of just feels a bit different feels like
I'm working different muscles so I used
a needle shop for these workouts because
it's a big it doesn't really affect me
as much so I can use English or I can
also use the pull attachment as well so
I just do those again 10 reps three sets
each leg I don't actually know the
technical term for this exercise it
could be like a cable deadlift but I
don't think it is I basically just hold
the cable attachment out and I squat and
then I intertwine them with a cable pull
through so I just pull through it's
really hard to explain you could just
watch the video and I do again 1012 reps
reset and I don't take any breaks in
between these so I just do the squat and
then the pull through their quadrant
over the next is the leg press machine
and if you do these like how you're
supposed to do them they will work your
quads a lot so how I do them is I focus
all of my weight on my heel and I push
to remove my field which then pushes
through into your glutes and it uses
your glutes if you just use your whole
foot you're just going to be basically
as New York was so I use my heels for
that and then I really feel it in my
glutes it was kind of a new one I've
been doing I saw someone do it and I
want to try it out and I've been liking
them
so I basically use this Smith's machine
and I only know about ten pounds on each
so not that much weight we definitely
could add more weight but I'm still
getting used to the exercise and I want
to get a little weight so that I don't
commit self and I just do a hip thrust
up basically it and again with all who
exercises you want to make sure that
you're squeezing at the top to really
engage your glutes and then the last one
is
hip thrusts distress this bars really
hurt it wasn't like a proper bar it was
really hurting me but I basically just
keep my upper back on a bench and then I
put that hit the bar on my hips and I
dip down and then push up I'm sure
you've seen me before but that is what I
like to do i you can see I don't squat
because squats are not the best exercise
to build the booty and not build alike
when you do squats like on a machine
with heavy heavy weight you're going to
build your your legs and I'm trying to
avoid up so I like to do different kind
of moves so that I'm really focusing on
my glutes
after I work out I usually do abs and
submit new abs every day it's not that
like much of a workout I'm happy to do a
video with all my favorite exercises but
at the end of work I just use two or
three exercises because a lot of those
workouts your your cores engage the
whole time so I really like legs
throwdowns or I don't know what these
are called like lift and then I do not
like 90-degree crunches and then I
really like the bird dog which is just
you put your arm out and off the light
and we do that and so that's why I my
workouts I just usually do abs take a
little break calm down
sometimes I'll roll out again and
stretch again but that's it that is why
I like exercises hope you guys enjoyed
