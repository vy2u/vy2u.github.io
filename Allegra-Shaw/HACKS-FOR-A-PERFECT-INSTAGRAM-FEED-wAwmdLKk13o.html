about Instagram I'm going to pull up my
notes right now I'm here we talked about
how to have a great Instagram feed I'm
going to fix my shirt first I will be
doing a video on how I edit my Instagram
photos if you want to call my aesthetic
I start off my Instagram is out Allegra
Shaw you can go check it out I my seed
is very like cool tone light bright
aesthetics but I keep it turned that
cool tone thing I've had that for a
while I have try out different Instagram
themes but I always kind of come back to
this cool tone aesthetic so my first tip
is to have a variety of different
pictures you want to switch up your
different pictures so have a selfie and
then have a product photo and outfit
photo photo with friends a selfie and
then kind of like have just a variety of
pictures you don't want to see a selfie
selfie selfie selfie selfie or like
episode of foot of foot of output so the
pictures that aren't of me or like me
and my friend I call killer pictures too
like pictures of my coffee table or
pictures of my bag pictures of the
scenery you can kind of like condensed
your color pictures if you want to just
have like a theme of your color pictures
so like just product photos or something
like that but I like to kind of give
myself varieties that it really does I
like to use my serum I don't want it to
be like super fake so usually when I
post a picture of an outfit I've worn
that picture I've learned that outfit
like that day or the day before but it's
totally fine to like take a bunch of
pictures at one time and I use those on
ongoing basis I do that was my Italy
pictures I used a lot of my Italy
pictures as continuous filler pictures
throw just have a variety of different
pictures and kind of mix it up great way
to do this is to plan your feed and you
can see what kind of like what goes
together and I use to plan my feed is
called mosaic I think if you paid for it
but it's totally worth it and then that
is that makes sure that like I don't
have to selfies on top of each other or
like something that like it all just
looks great my tip number two is for
pictures of yourself I switch up the
poses so have some pictures of you
some pictures of you standing leaning
drinking coffee you know likes just
switch up pictures of you people don't
want to see the same thing over and over
and I feel like when if when a seed
looks super produced it doesn't do so
well the seed needs to look natural and
Instagram is to share pictures of your
life so make it seem natural or just be
natural in terms of yourself candid
photos look really nice so just get
someone just continue to take pictures
and kind of just like move around but
this more natural your feet is the
better it will do and the more people
will want to engage with your feet I
think people really like to see pictures
I didn't make this up but I think people
really like to see pictures that they
feel like they should be seeing yeah I
mean my pictures that are super
overproduced it just sometimes they
don't do as well as like when I just
shot a picture on my iPhone and it was
just super natural in the moment and
then for your filler picture is having
our tip number three is for your goals
because having like good
instagram-worthy surfaces to like cool
tiles on the floor I have a sheet of
marble paper that I can put things I
don't have any marble services in my
house I just put that sheet if I want to
product photos I put the products on
that sheet of marble like stick your
sticker paper is a really good one a
cowhide on the floor but just Instagram
where these surfaces are good for taking
those like filler cashews or product
photos they're important use the same
filter on each of your photos they kind
of keep it the same aesthetic I like to
edit my photos in vsco cam or via KHOU
cam and I use the filter hb2 and I then
play around the settings to make it look
like my aesthetic I'll do a separate
video on how I edit - turn your photos
but that's what I do and I use up for
every single photo and it really looks
cohesive r5s to get inspired I go
through it through all the time and I
use that same photos feature I just paid
it to a collection and I keep a little
folder collection called like info and
Cisco and I have also my Pinterest page
the same thing and I just acres as IRA
pictures that I really like and that I
maybe want to recreate my own way or
just get inspired from those photos I
think it's a really helpful
way to kind of just get inspired and
feel creative portrait photos do way
better than square photos because when
you when you put a portrait photo but
people are scrolling through their
Instagram page it takes up most of their
phone and they're just way more usually
appealing someone rather than a
landscape photo or a square photo so I
highly recommend you do portrait photos
they always do the best for me and when
you're taking pictures on your your
Instagram just try to keep it all in
good in natural light it's not you can
used like artificial light like I'm
using right now but outside knocked her
light usually the best picture is super
dark and low quality it's really hard to
bump up the exposure both the highlights
of the shop and it just will end up
being a kind of bad quality picture keep
it light here bright unless you're going
through that like dark great quality
aesthetic and the pictures really dark
make sure it's amazing quality normally
- shutter light bright and beautiful do
the best that's all I have for having a
great Instagram thank you guys so much

video to how I'm in my my Instagram
photos so stay tuned for that if you
have any other folks if you have any
other video requests remember to leave
