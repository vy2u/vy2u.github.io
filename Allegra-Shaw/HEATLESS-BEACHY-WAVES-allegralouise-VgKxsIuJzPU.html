start out right out of the shower this
is a day I washed my hair but I will do
this whether it's a hair washing day or
not a hair washing day today just happen
to be a hair washing day and as soon as
I get out of the shower I just throw my
hair up into a bun done this forever it
gets it out of my face my favorite thing
I hate wet hair when my hair is up I
usually do my makeup a dress
eat that sort of thing and then my
hair's about fifty percent dry at this
point so I take it down and I shake my
hair out I always do a middle part
that's just what I prefer
and then while my hair is dry I can flip
it back and forth but I always do this
step with the middle part the first
product I always use is Aveda be curly
I've used the product on my channel a
million and one times it's my favorites
so I took a good sized amount and I
scrunch it into my hair always scrunch
my products into the hair that's what I
think creates like the definition and
the waves and it just gives perfect
texture so I just scrunch that in first
and then up this can kind of leave your
hair a little bit dry the next day so I
always take the igk hydrating balm
it's called mistress and I then scrunch
that into my hair these two together are
like the best thing ever I love it I
love these two products together they
work so well and then I take a zoo which
is like a honey hair honey the blogger
neguin need this goddess and they take
that and they put that in is just like a
healthy kind of product and also make
shine and all that good stuff
and then I let my hair air dry so this
is my hair a hundred percent dry and
then I always if it's a hair washing day
I'll put in some dry shampoo honestly
every day I put in some dry shampoo or
some texture spray to give it some more
texture and then I'll take the
you do again to just add some shine and
then that's it that's how I create my
beachy waves every single day so I've
