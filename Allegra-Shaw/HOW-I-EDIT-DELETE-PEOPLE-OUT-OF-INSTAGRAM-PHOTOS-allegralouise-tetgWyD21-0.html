edit my Instagram photos and I'm also
going to teach you how to crop people of
photos because this was very much
requested so I just thought I would
combine all of them into one okay so I'm
gonna do it on my phone while I talk to
you and I'm going to keep the screen
right there
so this is my photography folder I
usually just use vsco cam the SCO and
then for selfies sometimes they use
facetune but those two are my most used
ones so on Cisco I already uploaded
these photos and I'm going to go with I
like to just like edit photos and see
how they look like this one I really
like this photo but didn't really look
at that beb√©s
so right now I'm going to do these three
photos so here's the first photo I first
go into the one I call
the filter and I use HP - that's my
normal one - like there's so many
different ones you can get and I like a
lot of the other ones but my team is HP
- so I would first do that and then I
usually bring it down to about 8
depending on the photo but eight and
then I really want to sweep brighter so
I usually bring up the exposures with
whatever depends the photo but like Q
2.3 and you can also if I just clicking
on the image see what it looks like
before and after and then I kind of play
around it lately ever bringing the
exposure up to like 0.5 sometimes every
in saturation up to like one or two if I
feel like I look a little like pale or
something and shadows and highlights are
great for brightening a picture
you know we can change that around but I
usually do that and then I bring the
temperature to about 1.3 so that looks
good to me I like size you can see the
before and after so it's very cool toned
you can see my hair looks lighter the
only thing is like if you want to pan
and you do this you look very pale so
keep that in mind here's another picture
that I did all right let's do a okay
photo first so this picture is actually
taken on my big DSLR camera and then put
it in so unit does look amazing and
these two photos are usually easier to
edit because they're such good quality
like that looks good already
you just put one filter on and it's
usually bright enough again I know
everybody does eight or some point on
whatever layer on the exposure I only
have to bring this one up like point
five because it's already super bright
self-creation I could go for up one
temperature I could go down to one
see that and then I like this kids home
feature too that really just changes
your skin tone so sometimes if you kind
of you've filtered your photo and you
look a little orange or you look a
little green or pink you can play with
it so if you go to the right here it
turns your skin tone more red and this
way it turns it more like greenish tint
that was going to more red roof just
like my natural skin tone more pinky
than green so I bring that down to one
and then that looks good to me and then
I can even go back to this one and show
you what does the skin tone so you'll
see if I run this so see how this is
like super red this is super green so I
would definitely go up a bit give you
that more like red tan but our life's
like that look and then a selfie same
thing I was going to HP to bring it down
to a eight this is taken on my iPhone we
need to soldier up a little bit I'll
bring a Cointreau sup probably a little
bit saturation for sure and then we'll
be a little pale temperature down skin
tone more on the ready see that looks
really good
and then I would save that then I would
save it to my camera roll and I can
actually save this one as well and I'll
save this one
and then in space tune the only things I
use in Phase two are the peach whitening
tool and details tool Lindo see this dog
is I love him so I use the detail tool
on his photo here just to make him stand
out more but committed so for a selfie
this is something I would do I would
already assume this tool as well so I
would just kind of go with my face and
just smooth out my chin area especially
like how does it or something like I
don't want to remember that a husband so
I'm just gonna smooth that out details
and I usually would put the details in
my eyes and I'm wearing sunglasses so I
feel like detailed my lip a little my
lips a little bit and then I would
detail anything I kind of want to stand
out in the photos to my hair and then
that's it I would save that and then for
this photo I don't know what I would do
I would definitely detail my hair a
little bit just give them all that
beachy look
and then maybe smooth out my leg smooth
any kind of things that I want some it
up and that's it the great thing I'm
sure you've watched many videos like
this but the teeth waiting tool on phase
2 is such a nice white that if anything
is gray or like yellow you can keep
white and over it and it turns it like a
stark white alright so for examples is
Gucci photo um see onto the background
the pink you could put the teeth
whitening tool over it and it would make
the background white
obviously I'm doing this like really
poorly you can do way more better live
but it would make the background like
fully white and sorry you can see the
difference here and that's really is
great for white your teeth but also just
keeping with a white and bright setting
and then after I do all of that to my
edit my photos which is very like no put
a lot of time in editing them but I just
have my little way like the HP - I also
a blog post on how I edit so you can
check that out if you forget I bring the
photos in here to see if they look good
so I'm going to bring in those photos I
just edited I use this out the stuff
called mosaic oh I mentioned in my last
video it's a little glitchy I think they
don't up to be a penny more I know
they're not called to do them that can
do it as well but so in all the photos
are in the app and you can kind of play
around with them so try to like spread
out the key image and stuff so you can
just okay so in mosaic go up I will go
through and kind of plan out my speed so
I like that fading to be sure that I
wouldn't want to put another being to
picture so I was positive an outfit
photo takes forever on top now and then
collide is a selfie actually I wouldn't
do so because it we want with that
selfie on top of the dog it's like it's
too close to the same picture so I would
put like a feller photo I just use this
Gucci solar photo that I might use and
then maybe this selfie down here I was
in photo here so then kind of plan out
my feet that's basically it and then
that would be kind of what I was doing
there make it else good so I'm going to
post now I'm going to post this photo
and I was going to Instagram post it so
that's how I edit my photos I'm just
going to walk you through quickly how to
take people out it's literally the
easiest thing ever i use pic monkeys and
also use photoshop you can also use the
patch tool on facetune they all kind of
work the same way okay so basically I
will just go into pic monkey
I would click Edit and then I would just
open up the photo that I want to edit I
would do this before editing on my phone
for like doing the whole of this go edit
so I open the picture and then I would
go to the like little magic wand things
where I was kind of forgetting how to be
this I was in in a while and then I was
go to the bottom and I would click the
clone tool I was soo min pretty far into
where the people that I want to
eliminate are so want to limit this
trick taking a selfie so then I would
click on the area that I want put over
the person and then I would click on the
person and you would just start doing
that over and over until all the people
are gone it can be a super
time-consuming process but the end
result is usually pretty great and a lot
of time for students so yeah as you can
see I'm just like I like dragging and
dropping sliding I like painting over
her so just putting the water on top of
her face and I just did that for
everyone and then the end result pretty
great after I would delete all the
people that I was bringing the photo
into vsco cam to do the same sort of
editing and decide by size just makes
like such a beautiful picture and
compare us into what it was before so
hope you guys found this video helpful

photos and my theme and if you want to
call my people
