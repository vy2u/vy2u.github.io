today's video is about how to be happy
and how I got rid of mine xiety I'm just
gonna preface this video by saying that
I will be reading off my computer
because I want to hit every point that
I've written down so don't hate me for
it so if you like them being repetitive
that's great that really means that you
understand this stuff but everyone kind
of insurance everything differently so I
want to make sure that I hit all the
points and that everyone can kind of
understand and benefit from this video
the absolute last thing I want anyone to
feel that I'm being condescending or I'm
trying to prescribe happiness to
everyone I'm just sharing some thoughts
and what I personally do every day to be
happy if there's something that you do
that I haven't said I would love you to
comment down below so that everyone can
enjoy and learn from each other also I
really want this video this video is
about happiness and I really wanted to
be a positive space so there are any
super negative comments they're being
deleted so you might as well not write
it in first place and there's a
preconceived notion that you know
everyone's entitled to happiness might
be a shocker but that's not true
just like your physical health this is
something that you need to work on every
day some of you may say like one
depressed or I have a chemical imbalance
and just like a disease that's totally
true and that's totally okay trust me
but we're trying to do is work on what
we can actually work on I just want to
start off this video with a couple
tangible things that you can start doing
right away one is meditation so check
out my meditation video I have a full
beginner's guide to meditation to walk
you through how to start your practice
and to is physical exercise and physical
well-being just taking care of yourself
it's a really important part because
when you look good and you feel good
your attitude and you know endorphins
everything will change so take care of
yourself okay here's where we get into a
bit more of the heavier stuff and so
these are ways of thinking to work
towards happiness one is be here now
there's a lot of people who do the
classic humans
I'll be happy when so I'll be happy when
I get this job I'll be happy when I get
a raise I'll be happy I'm gonna do it
when I eat dinner I'll be happy when I
get into partner when I move it when I
grow up you can be happy right now
showing gratitude to the things that you
have right now and where you are in your
life is really important to be a happier
human if you're frustrated with where
you are or where you're not remember
that to get from point A to point B II
need to pass through all the points in
between to get to where you want to go
so where you are right now is exactly
where you should be
number two is try to love everyone and
everything I know this we really do
cooked trust me um there are two great
ways to kind of help you with this
number one is try to just think of
everyone as a child like a little kid
you probably wouldn't get mad at a child
for their actions so you just think of
everyone as a kid just like you know
trying to grow up and trying to get
through life it can really help you out
and number two is think of your life and
everyone else's life as a movies and
you're the main character in your movie
and everyone else is the main character
in their own movie you need to bring
other people into your movie and kind of
think about it in a bigger perspective
let me give you an example
a lot of you know that I was dealing
with a really frustrating situation with
the manufacturer and him being extremely
sexist and misogynistic well when I
thought about the situation I used these
kind of points to get through that and
move on so I thought I wouldn't miss a
child that was like my number one thing
I thought of him in his own movie and
he's just playing the character that he
needs to play so when he came into my
movie he was still playing the same
character that he was playing his movie
I was never gonna change his character
in his own movie so he was just in my
movie doing his thing and that's who he
was
and I was being my character in my own
movie and I tried to deal with him in my
own movie and I had to overcome whatever
challenges were happening number three
is everyone is self-centered and that's
not a bad thing this goes along with it
I was just saying everyone's actions
have little to nothing to do with you
and everything to do with them just as
your responses to their actions have
little to nothing to do with them and
everything to do with yourself and your
relationship with yourself
I am very guilty of this especially when
it comes to YouTube comments positive or
negative all comments affect me and I
know that that has little to nothing to
do with you guys or the people who are
commenting it has everything to do with
myself and my relationship with self
myself and how I feel about myself
number four is kind of just bear with me
it's kind of an interesting one Rome in
the world as a lion of self-control this
is from a book called be here now so a
big key to being happy is understanding
that you can control your thoughts you
can't control what happens to you but
you can control how you think act and
respond to what happens and I'm not
trying to say that you can control what
thought comes into your head every time
but if a negative thought comes into
your head you can rethink that thought
into a positive thought and the more you
change your thoughts and your actions
the more that those thoughts and actions
will become beliefs and then later on
those thoughts that originally come into
your head you won't need to rethink and
change because they'll just be good
thoughts so those are the tips and these
are the things that I do every day but
now that I've kind of gone through the
video kind of just feels like a guide to
getting through the day
so again if there's anything that I
didn't say that you do to be a happy
human I would love you leave them down
below
I want this comment space to be a very
calm positive and uplifting space and
who knows maybe there'll be a ton of
cool comments that I never thought of or
I don't use and I can even do an updated
video and use the things that you guys
do so yeah thank you guys so much for
watching I really appreciate it
look at all these love
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
