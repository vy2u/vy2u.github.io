their shellac so that it peels off
within three days I'm like literally
livid I don't want to pee my nails on
every goddamn week this paint peels off
in three days and now my nails look ugly
and to get them redone and I hate
getting my nails this is such a curse
troll problem I need to shut up
in other news also a first-world problem
I'm in line to get a yacht Diu a costume
tickets light what is it infinity
mirrors tickets
I was literally waiting for the
countdown at 9:30 and then as soon as I
hit 10 o'clock and the pre-sale open I
was 6,000 in line what no I've been in
line for two hours and I'm at 4300
anyway okay so today I wanted to do
because Valdez Day is tomorrow and I
wanted to do a video that was like
really different than what you would
normally see on Valentine's Day I feel
like the Lord who will put up with stuff
I'm like relationships or their
boyfriend tags or you know talking about
relationships and I wanted to talk to
you about how to be happy when you're
single because not everyone is in a
relationship and that's totally chill if
you are new here
I'm Allegra nice to meet you but I I was
single I've had boyfriends you know I've
had a few boyfriends but I was single
from 2014 to 2017 2014 2015 2015 20 yeah
2014 or 2017 I was single and I think
this society really you know plays up
relationships and they everyone feels
like you should be in a relationship but
let me tell you and I have a boyfriend
now and I think he's great and I love
him but those three years of my life
that I was single were the best years of
my life because I learned so much about
myself and I built such a great
relationship with myself and I just I
always recommend people to not jump from
man to man or boyfriend a boyfriend or
girlfriend a girlfriend and really take
some time to kind of grow with yourself
so I want to help you maybe get on that
process
maybe learn something if you have a nice
in the comments but let's just start
okay so number one is start building a
relationship with yourself at this time
in your life it's time to put you first
and really put you in center stage and
take care of yourself something I'll
whistle people is you need to feel whole
all by yourself and no one else should
complete you you should complete
yourself and I think that's I think
maybe a long time ago you know people
were like oh I felt incomplete until you
know I met this person but you need to
you can and you need to feel complete
all by yourself because what are you
gonna bring to the table if you're if
you feel empty dude I mean wait if a
little by yourself is to explore your
personality ask yourself questions
actually take time to reflect which I
feel like a lot of people don't do you
know take time to sit by yourself and
basically talk to yourself in your head
or at love but talk to yourself ask
yourself questions what do you want what
are your desires
who are you what makes you happy what
makes you sad like just basic questions
that I feel like a lot of people don't
take the time to actually ask themselves
or reflect a great other way to do this
is right
write down make a journal write down
your feelings and thoughts of the day
and then take the time to reflect on
those maybe every week or something
number four is what I really started
doing was learn to meditate when it
hitting really helps you become whole
and I do have a whole video on
meditation and how it helped me but I
really attribute a lot of my finding
myself and growing as a human to
meditation and number two so my number
two is I just I really think it's weird
when people say the end of a
relationship is a failure like it blows
my mind the end of a relationship isn't
a failure the end of a relationship is
just life it's just what happens
it's just didn't work out it's all good
it's not I really like I just can't
understand more like oh such a failure
that I didn't work out well it was meant
to not work out and we have to move on
from that he's got
let go the past what will be will be and
focus on today feel what you need to
feel and let it go don't stop yourself
from going through the motions
especially after a breakup feel it out
but you have to let it go and really
move forward and stop dwelling on the
past but I just want to put into your
head at the end of a relationship is not
a failure number three the most fun part
appreciate your freedom this is a great
time where it's just you and you just
get to take care of yourself do whatever
you want do things that you wanted to do
but you know never had the time or
always put aside do anything and
everything that you want to do because
right now you're so free you have no one
to call - that's right word number four
and this game is gonna be a hard one for
people do things alone I love to be
alone but I understand that some people
don't love to be alone but what I can
stress is try to do things alone go to
the movies aspire yourself no one's
gonna judge you no one cares go and
enjoy movie if you want to go to a movie
go shopping go shopping by yourself I
love shopping by myself the best go out
for dinner probably the hardest one that
a lot of people don't do go out for a
meal or lunch go for a meal by yourself
bring a book you know like a newspaper
or just sit here eat your food but do
that by yourself life changing there is
such a beauty in being able to do things
by yourself it's just such a liberating
feeling that you don't to rely on other
people to to do anything I remember when
I was single I actually when I first
started going out if a lot of my
girlfriends weren't at a pre drink or
something
and it was just guy friends I at the
beginning didn't want to go and want to
show up to the pre drink alone and in
the end I was like hey you got to cut
this out if you want to go out tonight
you want to hang out with your friends
and your girlfriends don't want to come
with you that's fine and he's - and in
the end I ended up going to the free
drinks alone and left about what to me
was a huge accomplishment because it was
such a now I feel totally comfortable
going forever alone but like that was a
really big accomplishment for me because
I didn't feel comfortable before and
then number five is also spend time with
friends and family spend time with
people who bring you joy and laughter
and do fun things and really build
relationships with your friends
that maybe you kind of didn't nurture
when you were in a relationship or they
have been nurturing spend time with
those friends spend time with those
family
I have spent so much time with all of my
friends when I was single and not
nothing I don't know but I really had so
much time because it was just me and I
didn't have to like you know build a
relationship I really got to like
nurture and build my relationships with
my friends and I think that I really
grew long-lasting life relationships
during the time that I was single number
six is flirt and date the most fun when
you go out flirt with guys or flirt with
girls or just have a fun time don't hold
yourself back go on first dates I was
such a yes-man when I one summer I was
single and I basically said yes to every
first date and I had some good ones and
I had some bad ones and I just had a fun
time but like that's what I was looking
for I was just looking for this fun time
where I could meet new people and go for
drinks and go for dinner and do fun
things and I would just felt very like
free to just be able to and even if I
felt like I didn't really want to go or
I was too nervous I would usually say
yes and just do it it's a life
experience and how can you say no to a
life experience and then at number eight
take all of the things that you learned
while you were single and bring them
into your next relationship be yourself
and be your own independent human even
when you're in a relationship you should
never feel like you need someone or
without someone you wouldn't be able to
go on you want this person you want them
in your life but you don't need them in
your life to survive and I think that's
a really important thing to remember I
can really appreciate this I remember
Joey and I had this conversation pretty
early on in our relationship and I've
known him for five years who were
friends we dated and then we did in and
whatever and now we're in a relationship
but what I told him like what I find so
liberating is I love you and I want to
be with you but I know I don't need you
and if we were to break up or if you
know something happened whatever I would
be sad for sure and I'd be devastated
and I miss him but I know that I have a
the unfulfilled life and I know what
it's like to have happy and fulfilled
life without him so it feels very
comforting I know that seems kind of
weird to some people but it's it is very
comforting to me to know that I'm my own
independent person I'm very fulfilled
and without him I'm also fulfilled and
he feels the same we had this
conversation he feels the exact same he
knows that he could have a happy
fulfilled life and if we did break up
we'd both be devastated and it'd be
really a sad time but we know what it's
like to live without each other and and
that we can be our own independent
humans I really appreciate that in
relationship because no one wants to be
dependent on someone else and dependency
is never attractive so yeah that's it
for my little how to be happy signal
video I hope you guys enjoyed it I
wanted to bring a little you know twist
to Valentine's Day because I know you
know Valentine's Day is tomorrow and so
you'll have a hard time with Valentine's
Day when they're not in a relationship
but I spent three Valentine's Days May
14 me I spent three top Valentine's Days
alone and I had a great time I went out
with my girlfriends one time or twice I
maybe we went out one time we went out
to like a bar one time I went out for
dinner and then the last time I think I
hung out with Shirin and we ate pizza
don't worry it's just a day you should
see it positively like I just love I
used to be cynical and be like I hate
valentines day what a Hallmark holiday
but you know in my adult life when I
would walk on the streets and during
Valentine's Day and see people just
happy and filled with love and buying
flowers for people it was just so sweet
so it's just a day full of love and that
can be love for anyone you could be
loved for your dog
if you want and that's it so thank you
guys so much watching it really preciate
it peace and love love you all bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
