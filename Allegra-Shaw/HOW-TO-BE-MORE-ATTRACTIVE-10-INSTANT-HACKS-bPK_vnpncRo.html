back a lot of you guys been asking about
why I sort stopped doing vlogmas
basically I was just putting a lot of my
time into making or editing videos had
to put one up every day and I wasn't
able to put a lot of effort into uncle
which was just kind of causing some
chaos at the company and I also wasn't
really taking care of myself because I
was putting myself so much into work so
I was meditating wasn't working out and
I just kind of need to reset recharge
and now I'm back there won't be blog
this but I will be putting out the same
two videos a week for the rest of the ER
so let's get into it
these are my tips to be hotter this is
actually a great day for me to do this
video because we pursue my period not
feeling great and these are good tips
for when you're just not feeling great
you're tired you're hungover if it's
date night if it's the first day of
school if it's something you're nervous
for these are the tips that I do to make
myself feel good better and ready to
call her whatever event I need to
conquer and if you are feeling good
never hurts to look and feel it's just a
bit better tip number one if you're
running late dry shampoo and a big
barrel curling iron are your best
friends I always have dry shampoo on me
or ready to go and you know if to you
know wash your hair you just spray it in
with a big barrel curling iron you can
just do the front of your head also you
can use a big section of hair so it kind
of goes on along faster doing the front
of your head and that's what people are
really gonna see just make sure the back
is smooth and not messy but you just
want the front to look good and it's
really easy with a big barrel curling
iron to is your makeup I have a five
minute makeup routine that I use almost
every day it'll be linked in the cards
but check out that you want to do the
bare minimum with makeup to make
yourself look awake and fresh but you
always want to wear lipstick because
there was the study and I said this
before but there's the study that when
you're wearing lipstick lipstick you're
perceived as having your together
and looking like you're more put
together than you actually are
number three is have a go-to outfit I
always have one go-to outfit we're kind
of like every occasion like a casual and
businessí one and maybe an event one
but if you don't have a go-to outfit all
block is your best friend there was also
a study on this one that people perceive
of who wear
all black eyes like higher about her
because there's less for them to look at
in and judge you about number four is
perfume we all know hump were mostly
with good first impression and scent is
a big part of identity as well as scent
really triggers memories so if you're
wearing a scent while you leave a good
first impression the next time a person
smells that scent or smells you that
memory of the first impression will be
triggered in their brain and it will
prime the way they think of you tip
number five and this kind of goes for
girls and guys wear heels wear shoe that
makes you taller people who perceive
taller people as more powerful when I
feel nervous or if I feel like I need to
make a really good first impression I
always always always wear heels a heel
bootie actual high-heeled it just makes
you look taller it obviously makes you
taller but it makes you look leaner and
I just feel like it really gives you
some good attitude you know like you
just feel really sexy and hot and heels
number six is sunglasses not only do
sunglasses hide your basically your
whole face they hide your bloodshot eyes
if you're really tired of hungover
they hide your gaze and they just kind
of give you this like shield and it's
kind of like a security blanket on your
face
number seven is kind of a weird let me
hear me out
it's chew gum first benefit of chewing
gum is almost a good breath everyone
likes good breath but the second benefit
is there was a study done by gum
companies but with their Society of
identical twins and more people prefer
the identical twin that was chewing gum
they perceive them as happier more
social and body so we're all the stories
behind to chew no more number eight is
kind of an obvious one but I forget it
all the time it's stand up straight I
tend to slouch I have to really be
conscious about signing up straight so
you stand up straight again
you're perceived as taller kind of
perceived as like having more presence
because your chest will be more open but
very important and it's something
I really need to work on number nine is
take and post a selfie take a selfie
start feeling yourself know that you
look good and number two post a selfie
because you want to prime whatever
you're seeing you want to prime your
brain for how you look if they already
see you and they see you looking good
when they fertile they're gonna have
that image or that memory of the selfie
in their head and last but definitely
not least my quote of life is fake it
till you make it
fake the confidence fake feeling good
fake feeling happy and half an hour and
we can realize you actually do feel good
you are confident and you are happy
