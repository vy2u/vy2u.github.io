thank you for joining me I didn't
Instagram poll last night on what do you
guys what you guys wanted to see first
booty your abs workout surprisingly abs
one I really thought booty was gonna win
but I'm into it this is my ab workout I
either sprinkle these exercises
throughout my workouts during the week
or I'll do like one big cardio announced
a kind of thing really depends on how
I'm feeling
I really do listen to my body to kind of
figure out what I'm gonna workout and
how I'm gonna work out disclaimer that I
have to make because YouTube is a savage
savage place I am NOT a personal trainer
I am NOT a fitness expert so I want you
to consult a fitness expert or personal
trainer or something of those starts
before you take my advice or before you
try something new I always recommend you
do things slowly and really check your
form there's a ton of different YouTube
videos on specific form for specific
movements everyone's body is different
so form does vary depending on your body
right like we have to kind of correct
things that our body actually does so
just keep that in mind before you leave
a savage comment down below other than
that let's just get into it these are my
favorite ab workouts at the moment and
things that I do to keep my abs looking
toned and tight and look do it I like to
add some something that will bring my
heart rate up and get my abs warmed up
so these are like walk down with a
mountain climber you can also add a
push-up for a more full body workout but
I just come up I do a nice deep breath
walk my hands down and then I do a
mountain climber like four or five each
leg I was really great at counting here
but I do about ten of these
this is a bird dog and it's one of my
favorite app exercises if you've watched
any of my other videos this is just one
I always do you want to use your
opposite leg and opposite arm and reach
out I for a little more difficulty out
of the little crunch before and after
you don't have to do that it's hard on
its own and it's a really effective
workout you want to keep your spine
straight head down so you're not like
straining your neck I do about ten each
side so 20 in total
a Russian twist is a classic he's gonna
bring your feet off the floor and tilt
your body back I usually look at the
weight you can also look straight ahead
but twisting your body with your own
body weight to create resistance and I
find this really really works the abs
these are like raises with little pop at
the end I like to keep my hands on my
side you can also put them under your
glutes but I just put my legs down as
far as I can't and then I like the
little pop at the end stick your legs
straight up I find it adds a bit more
difficulty to the exercise these are
great for targeting targeting your lower
abs or your obstacle and then these are
something that you can do as well I do
these at the end of my leg throw down
there just little scissor kicks this is
a bicycle crunch you can do different
variations where you're just moving your
legs I like to tap elbow to legs the
lower your feet the harder it is the
higher your feet the easier it is so
keep that in mind these are fun little
exercises I like to do and I don't feel
like lying on the ground they're just a
little squat with a side crunch these
ones will work to kind of outer oblique
areas and then you can also do the squat
with the cross crunch these will work
your abs and I like these sometimes I
don't want to get on the floor so these
are great also a good cardio movements
because you're moving around your heart
rates up that's great this is a bit of a
new one for me just keep your legs at a
90 degree angle and then drop one leg
down at a time I found it really was
effective in making the abbeys hurt this
is also a new one it's a Pilates
movement I actually could have brought
my body up more which I think would have
made it harder but you just scissor your
legs and hold your thigh I should have
brought my leg up more and held my calf
I think I would have made it harder
this is a great one for the obliques as
well it's just heel touches so bring
your body up your heels on the ground
and then shuffle your body side to side
using your abs to touch your heels this
is also one of my favorites is called a
stomach vacuum I'm not that great at
explaining it but basically you're
breathing out and then breathing in suck
pulling your stomach in pulling your
belly button to the floor and that's how
I finish off my workouts I would either
do this full set once or a Fuss feeling
compressive maybe twice or three times
depending on how I'm feeling each
exercise kind of varies and how many I
do but I will write down in down bar
what I usually do how many you usually
do but you have to make what works for
you thank you guys so much for watching
I really appreciate it peace and love
love you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
