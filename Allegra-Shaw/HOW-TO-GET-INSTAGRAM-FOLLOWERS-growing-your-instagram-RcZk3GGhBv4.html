video after I put up my Instagram
password perfect entry speed and also
how I edit my Instagram photos this was
the next requested video so gonna go
along in my little series I'm also going
to fix my hair okay so let's get into it
so the first thing is that you need to
do to grow your Instagram following is
post great content so you want to post
content that inspires people that is
very visually appealing and not people
like to see again check out my video on
how to have a perfect Instagram feed
vertical photos do the best because they
take up your whole the whole they take
up the person's whole screen right
photos do really well colorful photos do
better than black and white photos so
just posting content that really
captures people and people want to look
at those consistently but obviously
don't like bombard people because not
everyone is on Instagram to just look at
your photos right now is about 50,000
followers on Instagram and I post one to
two times a day and I don't usually go
over that I don't like to freak people
out but I usually do post once a day and
I think that's like a pretty good amount
Plus once every two days but don't just
post to post because if you're just
posting to post usually it is kind of
like shady content so just posed when
you have really good photos but right
now is hosting once you done today
engage with your audience comment back
on when they comment in your photos
comments other people's photos don't
comment like for life involved follow
like it's just so annoying people I mean
still annoying to me but comment nice
things in people's photos they notice
your feeds and featured or
collaborations are a great way to grow
your Instagram following so feature
accounts with a big account such as
feature a bunch of different people
instagrams and that will get you noticed
by people who might have not already
come across your account the return I'm
getting feature missed huge encounter
really small isn't usually good but as
you get bigger and you're posting more
consistent photos and
kind of a theme to your Instagram like
if you just closed out the photos we get
featured in an outfit Instagram like
that's really great for getting more
hallward's collaborations are great if
you find someone on it's terrific has
the same amount of followers of you or
as close to you have some clever it
together and then your colors to check
out their Instagram and their poll or
certificate your Instagram the best step
is using hashtags there is like times
with art using head you don't want
to use the biggest hashtags you're only
getting like three hundred likes on a
photo and using a hashtag that has like
millions of hits your photo isn't going
to like it's going to do show up on that
hashtags are a little bit not really in
a work in your favor you want to use
hashtags that are like the right amount
of hits for how many subscribers sorry
how many followers you have so just like
a look through the hashtags and you can
see how many hits are so gets not a big
following use the smaller hashtags to
people who around you're following will
probably be looking through those
hashtags as well I mean don't for me is
don't buy followers first of all you're
wasting your hard earned money there's
no point in your number buy followers
does nothing for fake accounts there's
no engagement and people can tell
because you have a million followers or
100,000 bucks whatever and you're
getting 2000 lexus picture or if you
have you know $30,000 you're using 200
like little picture that a ratio doesn't
add up
the ratio between followers and
engagement is usually 5 to 10 percent so
it's just very obvious and by polish is
such a waste of money and all the balls
will drop off it kind of died with
everyone who has put in the work to get
Instagram following and aren't just a
huge waste of money like why you paying
cupcakes people volume for appearance
it's just not worth it don't mind wall
words don't mind age you're like just
keep your money and just have fun with
this trim that's it
