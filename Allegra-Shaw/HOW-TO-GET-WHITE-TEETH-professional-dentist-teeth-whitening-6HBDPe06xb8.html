kid and it just says roosters are
ohtsuka compilations hey guys and
welcome to today's video a lot of you
guys asked about my teeth in this photo
after I posted this photo so I thought
that I would do a how I keep my teeth
white video and it's perfect timing
because crest has sponsored this videos
thank you to crest and using cross
products for years so I'm gonna teach
you or help you learn how to get your
teeth whiter at home easily very easy
steps to follow first tip is avoid foods
that stain your teeth pretty basic one
but there's a lot of foods that say your
teeth out there coffee included which is
devastating to me as I love coffee those
foods stain your teeth coffee tea red
wine I have them written down here
pickles
devastating lemon juice devastating
those things would be like cause damage
to your teeth can cause erosion to your
enamel make your teeth yellow and you
want to stay away from that but we're
not gonna cut it all those foods in our
diet obviously like I can't live without
coffee and pickles if you want to eat
those foods a great tip that my dentist
actually told me was to rinse your mouth
out after drink coffee or you you know
eat those types of foods just rinse your
mouth head after and it'll stop that
enamel erosion and I'll stop your teeth
from getting a yellow really easy all I
have to do is just eat the food and then
go to the bathroom with rinse your mouth
though
if you can't brush your teeth you drench
your mother the brush teeth if you
wanted if you just rinse your mouth i
didnt have time where see there you have
a toothbrush on you but i think you guys
are starting to figure that one out
another fun fact which i actually just
learned if you want to eat those high
acidic foods you have you can pair them
with less acidic foods to stop them from
ruining your teeth so easy one if you
want to drink red wine you compare with
cheese to balance out the acidity lessen
the damage on your teeth Ethan wanted
really good I mean she's anymore but I
was
scrape hearing the next one if you're
gonna chew gum chew sugar-free gum
chewing out it's a great tip I've used
this in a couple videos but for this
specific REIT tip the reason is chewing
gum activates like your saliva
it makes your saliva more with where
saliva in your mouth and that will like
neutralize the acidity
I'm not scientists okay
yes it increases the close live--i which
neutralizes acids in your mouth science
this is a great one if you love coffee
but you don't want to stay your teeth
with coffee same with tea you want to
stain your teeth with tea drink it out
of a straw drink it out of a reusable
straw because disposable straw is not
good for the environment
so here self a reasonable straw and you
can drink your coffee tea wine put the
straw in the wine bottle good tip this
helps for the ass this helps prevent the
acid from staining your teeth because it
doesn't have like direct contact with
your teeth it's just like going into
your breath you're swallowing another
tip which I'm sure you know is just wear
cool toned lipstick a cool tool lipstick
will help your teeth look whiter if you
use a warm toned lipstick it'll bring
out the yellow in your teeth but if you
wear a cool tone Lisbon lipstick that
has like undertones of blue it'll bring
up the white your teeth so whenever
you're looking for a lipstick always
make sure that it's cool toned oh I have
one here to show you this is a cool
toned red you'll be able to tell if it's
warm term warm tone or cool tone but I
find a cool toned red really really
makes your teeth look super white next
thing is using white strips I talked
about these white strips in my night
routine if you saw that in I think in
November these are the crest 3d white
Whitestrips with light and it's just
like a 10 day treatment results last
it's like 36 months but you can do them
more often if you want I think I do it
about like once the seasons like once
before winter what's for the spring
summer you know you get it you know what
the students are but what I really love
about this is you don't have to buy this
is a new box it but you don't have to
buy the light separately and I feel like
with a lot of the other whitening
systems you have to buy the light
separately I sent this in my nitrogen
feel like it's really great that the
light comes with the strip's you just
take a strip one to the top one for the
bottom you leave it on for about an hour
and then you do a light over top of it
and I've seen such a difference with
these my teeth just look like they've
been professionally whitened like it's
actually inside and it's just something
you could do at home you don't to spend
that ton of money on professional
whitening is you just do it at home you
can do whatever you want and it's a ten
day system and then if you didn't want
to do it for like thirty six months you
wouldn't have to but I just want to have
Ross Geller friends episode white teeth
that's what I want
are those your teeth lower the dark ah
next tip I just realized that I have not
been saying what tip number we are on
but you know use an electric toothbrush
I was such a skeptic about electric
toothbrushes you have no idea I just
thought like what's the difference I'd
be using a soft bristle manual
toothbrush like my whole life and I
thought like that's the way to go when I
was said this one this is the oral-b
genius 8000 in rose gold it's very
pretty life-changing like actually
life-changing and I don't want to sound
like preachy but amazing it just like
makes your teeth feel way more clean
than you can do with just your hand I
get like a soft bristle head still I was
such a skeptic and I even said to my mom
like mom electric tree pushers are
amazing and she was like no not manual
toothbrush it's like it's the same like
now I know where I learned it from like
everyone should be using electric
toothbrush they're amazing uh this is a
pretty standard one to using a whitening
toothpaste this is a crest whitening
therapy I have on my sink right now they
have a toothpaste for sensitive teeth
they like a sensitive line and I usually
do a sensitive teeth to toothpaste
because I can be prone to having a bit
of sensitivity but this is just the pure
whitening one enamel care though so just
take care of your enamel using a
whitening toothpaste every day we'll
just help ensure that your teeth are you
know getting rid of stains and your
teeth are just white and then the last
tip is something that I just started
doing I just have a small obsession with
it and it's just scrape your teeth or
what's the scientific term scale your
teeth you don't have the actual like
tool but I'll insert a photo or
something this when plaque builds up on
your teeth obviously the plaque isn't
white and like looks yellow your teeth
look not best when you have like a clock
everywhere and I have had one of these
for a long time I just started like
scraping the plaque from in between my
teeth similar to flossing but it gets
like the scraper really gets like hard
plaque out and I have a small session
with it I do it almost every night now
because I just love it it's like that's
satisfying like popping a zit how
satisfying that is
I feel about scaling your teeth it's
really great it'll help with the
build-up of plaque
it's actually good for your teeth I mean
don't like go in there link it making
gums all bloody but like no it's good
for your teeth the dentist does it so I
do like every night now and I have a
small obsession that is it for this
video I hope you guys learn something I
hope you guys all have beautiful white
