good morning Vietnam I'm on in Vietnam
I'm in Toronto
I'm always wanted to feed health and say
that it's vlogmas day 9 sorry the Sun is
pluggin bright today didn't Wow I went
out last night
super finally by two locals only and I
went to this new place called borrow
more like Escobar which is like the
secret bar and the bond secret bar
everyone knows about it yeah
Escobar used to be the buyer Valadez it
all does Burt got torn down on today's
agenda I am gonna go get a tea and some
food
probably something kind of unhealthy
thoughts of a feeling right now and then
I have obviously some work to do and I
have to make a dog for women and I'm
gonna go through my hair care routine
with you so let me go get a tea and then
I'll do my hair care regime before I
head out to get its he I wanted to show
you these Cotton's this in sweatpants
that I got you can't see them because
it's not focused
I hear understand mr. block but they're
my favorite sweatpants ever caught in
citizen but they're like 300 bucks so I
got a tea Tim's then I got a hash brown
don't judge me okay so sorry little echo
in here and I'm in the bathroom
I just wanted my hair carotene because
someone requested I do this in a blog
rest so I it doesn't it's not big enough
to do a video about it so I'm just gonna
do it in this log mess I have I have all
the products that I use in my hair right
here so first off um so I look like a
disaster right now
first off shampoo I use the Schwarzkopf
essence all team amber and oil nutrition
shampoo I was originally sent at this
shampoo and then I've action your
purchase mix I really like it so they
use that and I washed my hair about once
or twice a week I used to wash my hair
once a week but I was feeling pretty
grimy in the middle of the week it just
depends on the week for me so easy
they're just Thursdays or Mondays and
Thursday
but yeah the conditioner uses the
macadamia natural oil deep repair mask
conditioner of uses for a little time to
really like it
and that's all I do in the shower and
then it's not a shower
um if I'm gonna do a hair mask which I
rarely do I use coconut oil this is just
a jar event but the dry shampoo I use
I've talked about so many times to keep
my hair looking not disgusting is the
batiste dry shampoo fell under someone I
love this stuff I use it constantly it's
my favorite one
he protected if I'm gonna style my hair
I always use a heat protectant I either
use the Nexus Pro mend heat protecting
this one smells really good this one
also smells really good
I'm Orion is the Schwarzkopf crystal
shiny productive so these two at once I
use the hairspray I used is the
Schwarzkopf all-team crystal shy and
extra hold hairspray for oils
I'll use the Marrakesh oil argument have
oil therapy if I want to make my hair
look better than it does right now
there's also the name the argan oil that
I use if I'm I'm styling my hair I also
use the nexus youth renewal pump and
lift blow dry spray use that when I
here's wet and then on my normal and I'm
making it like I don't know I'm like a
normal day
use the Advaita be curly absolutely love
the stuff I'll never stop using this
stuff talked about so many times to my
Holy Grail product so that's and then on
a freshly washed hair day because I hate
the feeling of freshly washed hair I
also throw in either the
Devon Divine's Davines sea salt spray or
the fabfitfun everyday Beach waves
spray but I like this one more but I
either use these on the freshly washed
hair day to get my natural hair because
this is like too soft for me and then on
every other day you
like I'm my hairstyle that my hair's not
styled I use the triple sec three-in-one
driver are a thing that's it also lately
I've been styling my hair a lot but
usually I just need my hair natural
especially in the summer my hair will
just be natural the whole summer okay
quick outfit of the day I look kind of
like a disaster like only makeup on or
anything but I'm wearing the uncle poor
boy hoodie I'm wearing an uncle jean
