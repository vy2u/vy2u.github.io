look good in every photo up you're
instigating off your selfie game off
your facebook profile picture game up
here and take you through the friends
game okay let's jump right into it does
really need a preamble by the way this
is my uncle feminist tee check them out
so we link down below yeah looks good so
do you ever want to know your angles you
should know your face you should know
what looks best what angles you like the
best whether it's straight a little bit
to the side or up or down whatever it's
just going to mirror or ploy your phone
and play with angles and learn your face
so you know exactly what way to turn
your head when the cameras on you or to
is to get inspiration I really like
looking through Instagram for
inspiration and then I love that little
phase buns like save photos just ran out
so just getting inspired by other
people's photos or you know it's just
like they it's basically making a board
for yourself and any photo shoot is
going to have a mood force so you know
getting inspired by a girl like position
or like ascetic or guy whatever it is a
big girl or just a photo you see some
photographers being kind of like me call
me the way that person's moving any of
that getting as far as definite the best
way to take this oil number three which
is like the ultimate tip and the only
thing you really need good lighting good
lighting is like Oh makes your photo way
better natural lighting is the best but
if you're going to go size you want to
shoot when it's overcast and not when
the sun's directly on you because it's
from sharks we all use to create weird
shadows and weird to be squinting or be
hot does about so you want to be
overcast or by window if you want to do
two good selfies go to a window you're
inside and you don't really have a
window or anything artificial lighting
is great The Linde case but like right
now I'm using a window on this side and
then I have two artificial lights here
actually also have an artificial light
behind me to brighten up the background
Plus that like lighting language also is
it's like a sunny day you can wait for
golden hour or magic hour there's
actually an app that sounds exactly when
gold now or magic
is called magic hour and that's when
something is like set there's no harsh
lighting it's like it's like the perfect
time to take photos I usually use the
magic hour at night and all the mornings
like I'm not going to get up over the
Sun when you're taking a selfie you want
to have your go-to faces so you know
think about it and just kind of do it
for example mine I have a few I do the
pony lips so example so what I do is I
just like create a little air pocket and
I pop out my top left to make me look
configure the smile I do like up that's
my smile I mean some of the smiles my
teeth about a one in a million
anyway tongue out and then I always like
throw a hand at the picture I find it to
put a hand in your picture just look
look we're not troll and also pose so my
go to like the hair here even just like
throwing hands up my favorite and then
for standing photos there's a lot of
tricks I'm sure you've heard of a lot of
the tricks so number one is the fake
wall keeps kind of like fake walk and it
makes look natural just the photo some
movement and then when I'm standing I
put my legs apart a little bit just
creates a really nice shape to your body
also makes you look taller it also makes
the clothes fall more nicely and if your
legs work together just standing there
the biggest model tip in the book is the
invisible heel just where you like
you're a sloth you just pump your heels
up and stand on your toes
lots of often videos why I stand on my
toes it just makes your body look mixer
it makes you look slimmer taller so I
always stand on my toes one foot in
front of the other more weight on your
back leg it sounds like really
complicated but wants to get a few times
you oughta just kind of does it and I
will just like to make your body look
way better slimmer and the clothes look
nicer my lawsuit is like the candid shot
everyone loves a good candid shop again
I wasn't it wasn't ready some picture
would you're with a friend you take like
laughing so I'll take a picture of you
every time like August they should be
taking more than just want to make sure
who out for one cue Hagen whether game
you just move slightly Vince this fixed
your hair look down up just keep moving
and then you'll probably get a picture
that you like again that was my six tips
take a lot of photos and keep moving no
one's going to get the right photo of
the first one actually sometimes I'll
take a million selfies and that's what
the first one is the best one so what am
i let me take a lot of pictures out of
like 100 pictures I usually get one
so whether selfies are out the pictures
just take a lot move have fun with it
and be confident confidence is key in
any photos of your comp and you're
rocking it the photos going to you're
going to like the photo if you want to
learn how I edit my Instagram I have a
video for that and if you want to learn
