essentials video this is all the stuff
that I need to bring on to the plane so
carry-on essentials I have a very busy
month this month I'm going to LA and
then put it Paris and with my Paris trip
we have a stopover in Iceland so these
are all things that I'll need for this
trip I want to thank Cottonelle for
sponsoring and collaborating with me on
this video without them this video would
happen so here is my bag it is the
Phillip Lim Ryder bag I don't think one
is available anymore so I'll link some
other options down below that are
similar or that I just like let's get
into it I section everything off so that
it's very easy to find so let's just
start with this little pouch so this
little pouch has all of my like beauty
and you know like feeling fresh sort of
essentials first one are these cotton L
fresh pair of wipes these are really
great to travel with they're so small
and compact
they are hunched up flushable so fit for
the environment that's always a bonus
alcohol-free very important and they're
really easy to use and they dry really
quickly so I highly recommend you have
these in your travel carry-on they're
essential the next thing I keep in here
our face masks because it can get pretty
dry and gross on the plane this is a
flawless and 15-5 flawless by Friday I'm
so I just on the face mask and then I
also keep the little eye ones just in
case I don't want to have like a full
face mask on this one with the eye ones
on and then I also sometimes keep like
hand masks and also feet masks there's a
really long flight I really like the
ones from Sephora I have the Bioderma
what's this called again my seller the
seller water and I usually keep a
toothbrush in here and just have the
case
little bitty toothpaste is also very
important to me immerse my teeth a lot
and then I keep these two sajhe
one you're like essential oils but like
chocolate whales so this is one thread
aches this one's for stomach problems my
two things that always get me so I not
to have these let me at all times so I
just keep everything packed in this
little pouch
I see that later the next little patch
is this one which also kind of doubles
as a purse so I can use this as like a
fanny pack or what I'm traveling around
so I don't drink a half pound like two
purses in one in this one I just keep
all my very important things so I keep
my passport my little card holder with
all my parts in it so I'd like my US
visas in hereand so OD headphones very
important and a pen always remember a
pen because it's the worst have to ask
someone and I know what to say but I
keep my computer my computer not in here
right now it's being used but I always
have my computer in my carry-on and then
in the case I'll keep the computer I
keep my charger I was only bringing the
small charger when I travel and then I
also keep my harddrive essentials I
always have a pair of socks
who doesn't like good lucky socks on
plans you know it I keep the book I'm
reading I would prefer not travel with
this particular book because it's so
large so I always kinda bringing a
smaller book but this is the book for
every year analysis meet me a third
grade book read it so always carry about
preferably a smaller one I always keep
change of underwear so essential
especially you have a layover you need a
change of underwear he wants me wearing
the same underwear for like 24 hours and
then my last little compartment here
have a these are things that I like I
feel like I need to reach for more often
so I have gravel advil and ginger gravel
these are like essential I would bring
big ones of these in my check bag but I
live off this stuff and usually I would
carry a smaller one of these they do
have a travel size this is 100 mil so
this one would go on the plane but I
would definitely pick a smaller one this
is the caudally facial mist let's look
at variation everything like that one
the lips lead mask by a banana I love
this stuff I keep a face moisturizer
this is the cuddly face moisturizer hand
cream is so essential for me I have the
lioness and driest hands in the world so
soon as I go to the plane my hands need
some moisture eyedrops again planes
dehydrate everything in your body it's
gross
mints I like mints morning I like gum
just my preference hair tie oh this is
essential always need to bring an extra
hair tie so that's that and then in my
like side compartment in this bag I keep
a deodorant phone charger and sanitizer
also us and that's it seems like a lot
of stuff but I mean here to be on the
plane for a long time I'm you now I'm
gonna show you some great travel outfits
so let's just head on over and do that
this first outfit is probably my most
worn on the airplane it is an oversized
denim jacket this one is from uncle at
Sur for your city jacket just an
oversized vintage tee black leggings and
a black Chelsea boots it's really comfy
but it looks very cute I really like
this outfit for long flights it's a good
pair of sweat pants these ones are from
mr. Saturday and then I'm wearing an
uncle tea just tied up in the front I
sure want a leather jacket over top and
my Gucci slides and it's just an easy
outfit you can take on and off layers
Gucci slides
easy to go through security this outfits
thrown you have to look presentable when
you get off the plane it's still a comfy
and casual but it just looks more put
together than the other outfits I have
