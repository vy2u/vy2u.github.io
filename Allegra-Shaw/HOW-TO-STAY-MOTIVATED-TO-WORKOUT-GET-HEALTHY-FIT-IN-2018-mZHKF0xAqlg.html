to address one thing actually two things
but first if I seem distracted it's
because I have this puppy she's my dad's
dog and I'm babysitting her for a month
and it's hard to get anything done
because this little bitch is a clinger
stage 5
she only wants to sit on my lap and it's
very hard to get anything done but she's
only four months so she's a baby the
other thing I want to address is I just
want to say thank you to everyone who
sent me messages and understood if you
don't know I lost my grandfather on
Christmas Day and it was kind of sudden
and yeah I wish I just had to spend I
spent the week of my family and just
supporting each other and it was it was
a really hard loss so I just want to say
thank you to everyone who 70 messages
and we're very supportive and keeping me
and my family your thoughts it was just
it was really nice to see everyone being
supportive and understanding but it's
definitely been a difficult holiday and
a difficult start to the year but that's
life that's what happens so yeah
so in this video I want to discuss I
know a lot of people love to set new
year's resolutions and that's great so I
want to help and this doesn't have to
necessarily be for New Year's but I want
to help you set goals and achieve those
goals I'm specifically going to be
focusing on going to the gym and working
out because I know that can be the
hardest one to to keep for the new year
or for a full year and I know a lot of
people really want to get in shape and
stay healthy and this is a great time to
start doing that so I want to help you
stay on track I'm not gonna give you a
goal you everyone has their own goals
people has to do with working out
staying fit and staying healthy this
year I'm gonna help you stay on track
for that you're all has to do with like
meditating or being happy and positive I
do have other videos I do have other
videos and I will link them down below
but this video is going to center around
how to start your gym journey my first
tip in general - you know achieve your
goals this year is to start small and
get bigger you don't want to set your
goals so big that they're gonna
overwhelm you
you know there's to me so big and
daunting that you're not gonna know
where to start set your goal small and
then grow them over the course of the
year so for example if your goal is to
you know go to the gym more often maybe
start out once a week maybe you start
out three times a week and then grow if
you set your goal to you know seven days
a week or five days a week and you never
really go to the gym it's gonna be a
really hard task to accomplish so just
set them small publish those as you get
more accustomed to the new lifestyle
change then you can go up and I think
that you know anything in stages is
easier than just piling a new lifestyle
change on to your schedule number two
seems a bit annoying but tell people
about your goals tell your friends tell
your peers it might sound it might seem
a bit you know annoying but you're gonna
feel socially responsible you're gonna
feel like you have to
live up to this expectation because
you've told people about your goals and
you're gonna want to accomplish them you
don't want to let other people down it
takes 21 days to make a habit so your
first three weeks are the most important
in this new lifestyle change that you
are bringing into your life so you want
to really focus on this new lifestyle
change for the first 21 days after that
it will become easier number three and
this is specifically for the gym and
working out have your workouts plan
before you go to the gym when I first
started working out if I went to the gym
without a workout plan I would stand at
the door looking around being like what
do I do what machines do I do how do I
use them and I would just feel so
overwhelmed with the experience so I
really started getting into gym when I
had my workouts set and when I went to
the gym I knew exactly what I was doing
a new how many reps I just had
everything written out on me ready to go
a great way to learn how to workout is
to get a personal trainer if you can
afford it or get a friend who's really
great at working out there's a lot of
people on YouTube as well
Abbi Pollock is really great I love her
video she's very informative and very
scientific there's a ton of different
people who can help you with form and
help you with workouts you know use that
personal trainer twice get some workouts
get a set and a personal training
schedule and then you can go to the gym
by yourself and it'll be a lot easier
number four again for the gym get some
workout clothes that you love and feel
good and don't go and spend like a
thousand dollars but you know get a
great pair of leggings got a great
sports bra get a pair of shorts a pair
of running shoes just have a little set
I don't even have I mean I work out all
the time and I don't have a lot of
workout clothes but I have things that I
love and I feel good in and just get you
know a few things that make you feel
good and make you feel ready to hit the
gym feel it in looking good number five
don't eat like if you want to
change in your body you know
there's a saying I think it's like abs
are made in the kitchen or something
like that it's like 80% you know what
you eat 20% working out I might have
made those statistics out but it's
something along those lines and set
these unrealistic expectations but you
know we all know when we're eating like
 and when we're eating healthy so
clear your cupboards try to only keep
healthy options in your house so it's
easier to cook keep some healthy
cookbooks with some healthy recipes
ready to go and you just want to make it
really easy and convenient for yourself
with takeout if you know that you like
to eat out a few times a week have some
healthy takeout restaurants I live in
Toronto and I know that some a good
healthy option for me is fresh fresh is
healthy good restaurant that I know is
on food aura and if I don't have any
time I need to eat something it's a
great option for me so have some meals
prepared hassle you know only healthy
options in your kitchen have some good
healthy take out options ready to go and
don't eat like chef I'm pretty sure my
dog is humping one of her toys right now
and number six today is January 2nd and
if you didn't start your goal yesterday
or if you didn't start your goal today
it's okay you don't have to start on
January 1st you can start literally
whenever you want it doesn't have to be
a new year it doesn't have to be a
milestone you know it could be tomorrow
it could be next week whenever you're
ready just start it don't wait just
start it I hope you guys enjoyed these
tips to stay on track for your New
Year's resolution or your goals that
you're setting for this year I know this
is this was specifically focused on the
gym because I think that's one of the
biggest I got a lot of messages one of
the biggest goals one of the biggest
resolutions that I've seen is always
getting healthy and getting fit for the
new year it is a new year so if there's
any specific videos you want to see I'd
love if you could comment down below let
me know your new year's resolution I
think that I'm starting this year is

more productive in my work days I

new thing that I'm doing but I'd love to
