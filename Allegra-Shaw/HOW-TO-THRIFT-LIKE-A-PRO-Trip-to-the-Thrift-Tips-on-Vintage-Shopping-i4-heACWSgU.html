flip so today I thought it'd be really
fun to do a video on thrift shopping and
how I throw shop and how Joey used to be
like a vintage dealer so that's a crazy
thing to call yourself a vintage dealer
so Joyce be like a vintage dealer and
this is thrifted and Joey yeah we're
gonna take you on there shopping we're
gonna give you our tips on there
shopping how to get the most out of your
experience because sometimes it can be
like just overwhelming so first we're
brunch
we just left brunch the destroyers we're
going to go to in Toronto are public
water it has the vintage I think what we
want to find their first tip I have is
Google is Google where you want to go so
I'm in what are you doing the first tip
is googling where you want to go so make
sure that you kind of have like a set
either like one store or like we know
that public butter it has some integer
cross through each other's you can but
hit those together make like a sort of
like a plan of what stores you want to
go
it's made a really good point you just
like googled Toronto VIN did you
probably end up the black market which
isn't bad like it is a decent vintage
store they have some stuff but like
there are definitely some better hidden
gems so maybe looking up like the blogs
in that city or blogs in your own city
that kind of break down the vintage
stores and what you could find there
like house vintage is really great for
denim and public butter is really
earth-like literally everything but have
some vintage is more curated we just
thought of another tip it is the weekend
right now because we want from this
video but go vintage shopping during the
week it's less busy and the selections
better a lot of vintage stores get their
stuff in on Tuesday and Wednesdays so if
you go like Wednesday Thursday Friday
you're gonna have a way better selection
yeah the select is gonna be great but
we'll see it keeps from our public
butter my first tip is to while you're
in the store is to like go in with a
loose idea of what you want but be open
to the possibilities of what you can
find
hey with denim this is where at cosas
vintage which has like the best care in
selection denim and really good sizes so
you want to try some bonds some years
you never daughter's it'll look like
message right on it honestly it looks
way better yet and then for denim you
can go like like public butter you get
done in for like ten bucks but here it
looks like 50 and this is really
curating selection so you're basically
paying for the department and then as
well as like their work of like seating
out all the
if you can't get that little hand motion
again pull these shits the shirt like
eight down from you look so nice
any shopping is never like a quick in a
no you got it put time aside to and as
we're learning today sometimes you don't
find anything you wanted a sort it'd be
really irritating true like I came for a
black house again I'm not here
this is a no this is cool
obviously Joey finds like the sixth
piece in the story fits in perfectly
another one
if he says and I just want to recap all
the points so I feel like I was a little
bit scattered have a loose idea of what
you want be open to possibilities like I
went in for denim but I ended up getting
you know some tees and a jacket have
some time set aside because it obviously
takes longer than just like normal
shopping it was like try stuff on you go
through a bunch of racks hand sanitizers
always a good one it's pretty gross in
there try stuff on so when you're trying
to like you're gonna have to try stuff
on I had to try on a bunch of stuff so
wear something when you're shopping
that's just like easy and easy to change
out of and comfortable we had a point
normal vintage prices for a t-shirt are
around like five to twenty five dollars
obviously depends where you are but if
it's like more than that it's more than
that and they say like it's because it's
like special or real vintage just make
sure that like you check the tag and it
has tags that was his point and then for
denim so you saw me trying a bunch down
I was surprised at those two pieces fit
that's pretty crazy and never find
things that fit so like when a vintage
piece fits me I like denim wise I
usually just buy it because I never find
anything but just like B when you're
trying to I want if it's not like
perfect just be aware of what you can do
with it so
if you like for example those black ones
like I didn't like the bottom but I'm
gonna cut them or I'm gonna cut them
into shorts or even couldn't maybe try
like a flare it very overexposed I'm
gonna try like a flared kind of cropped
look but you can always get things taken
it in the waist you can cut things you
can cuff them so just be aware of what
you can do hope you guys enjoyed this
little 15 video and I will do a thrift
haul all the pieces I got probably my
next video so thanks for watching peace
and love y'all what also because we're
traveling if you guys let us know we're
at the best man oh yeah so we're going
to Miami at the end of the month and if
you have any if you're from Miami from
Florida just Miami know like I'm not
going anywhere else in Florida if you
have any good vintage shops I'd love to
know where you shop for vintage there
cuz I mean I feel like the state has the
best mentor selection look at that dog
oh my god oh you're so cute ok so that's
it thanks for watching peace in love
