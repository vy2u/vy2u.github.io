all of them into the most perfect
t-shirt dress ever took out all the
things we hate it about the other ones
so it's really great uhm and then we're
working on some other
things to get off that leave the primate

in progress and we will be bringing more
things out but we're really excited you

it'll just be amazing so that's that we

super cozy sweaters but they're like
Crofts they're kind of perfect for like

what I've been working on for years is
my babies my companies and I'm I'm I'm
so excited about their launched yeah so
let's move on to the products so the
first product is the Laura Mercier
tinted moisturizer in the color bisque I
love this stuff I wear it every day um
the best to new moisturizer I've
actually ever used so I'm gonna do an
updated makeup routine because it's
changed a lot so and loved me not to go
along with that and letting me nyx
concealer in cwo 3 it's kind of this
salmon eat in so it does cover dark
circles really well and I have been
obsessed it's really inexpensive which
is nice if you saw my skincare routine
you would have seen these the body shop
drops of life drops of light for pure
healthy brightening serum I can't read
and I use these morning at night and I
just really like them I like the way
they feel missing like the way it feels
on my skin and I like the way my skin
looks softer so I've been loving that oh
I can even mention this the next thing
which is kind of random are these razors
it's just like a I think these are like
base razors and I know a lot of girls
like shave their like mustaches like
cyber and stuff
I really have that but what I do do what
I do who do is when I put my eyebrows
because I don't watch my rows because I
do myself pluck all the hairs and then I
will take this razor and I shave like
around my eyebrow here here and it just
makes it look really clean a little
risky but I'm pretty good at it so
that's how I do my rosy next thing is
this Julia I'm not sure if I mentioned
it before but I were I ever sent these a
while ago it's a small company called
moms and monsters it were much for Julia
my birthday but it's like really boho it
was silver jewelry this is a hamsa hun
Nicholas and then there's like a half
moon necklace and I love love love this
stuff I think it's really beautifully
made and really good for the festival
season the next thing is we're done with
makeup and blank clothes and stuff so
the next thing is kombucha I've been
loving kombucha I think it makes my
stomach feel way better and I'm actually
this is a blueberry maple one mmm
and he's so good you can actually beat
kombucha and then they don't look into
doing that because I feel like that'd be
really cool but it's really good for
your stomach this might actually just be
Canadian
kombucha exits the Cole prize but you
might reach anywhere but I'm gonna look
into making it I feel like it's really
cool to make uh what else this this book
oh I read the book in like two days
this is the best book I've ever written
about written like I wrote this book
this book is the best book I've ever
read in my life it was so beautifully
written
the lessons are just amazing it's just
plainly put easy to read flows really
well like I don't have enough good
things no I don't I don't have any bad
things say about this book um that ding
was like tears were coming there was
just so many motions and I'm like I I
have no worries because I like a lot of
this book so much um I highly highly
recommend you read this book but I've
been which people were telling me to
read this book for years and I never did
but I'm actually happy that I read it
now because I feel like this in this
time in my life I gone a lot more out of
the book then I would have if I had read
it like four years ago or two years ago
or whatever um I I've gone a lot I I
will read this book over and over you
know as I get older and I feel like I'll
just get more at the book as time goes
on such a beautiful written book um if
you know any well I know Paulo Coelho
has written other books if you've read
any of the other books by him I would
love to know which ones you like the
best
I want to read them so yeah let me know
this book's amazing up the last thing is
my bedding and if you follow me on
instagram you saw that I got smart
bedding last month and the story behind
that is I moved into my own place I
hadn't seen many from University it was
disgusting
made me want to throw up so I threw it
out and a lot of my friends had been
talking about smart betting and like how
cool looks and blah blah and I had
worked with the company who owns smart
bedding before with my feet with the
peel cases which I still have my phone
right now
so I reached out to them and you know
gave me menstruation and I bought the
smart bedding in charcoal gray and I
assessed fit the only one to say is you
have to wash it a couple of times before
you put it on your bed because it does
Hill at the beginning it is linen
I've even odd though it is amazing it's
like super soft and really comfortable
and I get softer as you as like time
goes on and you wash it but the best
thing about it is that the top sheet
snaps on to the duvet cover because I
know like I sleep like a crazy person
sometimes they just end up inside my
duvet cover
so my fitted sheet would just be like on
the ceiling it was just crazy so this
keeps your fitted sheet actually on your
body and it actually I just have
actually a lot it makes you not have to
wash the duvet cover as often which is
amazing and watching TV covers yeah
so I've been really obsessed with smart
bedding um it is pricey but you can pay
monthly I'm pretty sure it will be like
double if you watch I'm gonna I want to
get the white color and I love the pink
I love all of them I want to get more
colors so yeah not actually it say
Ashley again Laura that's it for this
monthly favorites video I hope you guys
enjoy this video please check out la
dregs and please check out uncle I mean
the world to me but I'm super excited
putting
look books to do with that soon so yeah
