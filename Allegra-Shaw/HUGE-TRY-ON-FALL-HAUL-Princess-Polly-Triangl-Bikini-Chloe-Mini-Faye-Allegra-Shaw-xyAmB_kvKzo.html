little bit different just because I'm
filming on my blog camera because as a
lot of you have noticed my big camera
was slowly dying and I don't know just
something's really wrong with it and the
quality just isn't there anymore so
we're gonna be blogging are gonna be
shooting videos on my vlog camera for
the time being until I get a new camera
which will be soon today I am gonna do a
fall haul for you um I was also gonna
wear a lipstick and then I put it on oh
my god it was just so ugly it was like
it was like that burnt orange color I
wanted but I had purple sparkle in it it
was so ugly so the first place as per
usual that I always do is princess Polly
and I actually start with accessories
this time cuz I got two new really cool
pairs of glasses that I'm very into the
first ones are these ones and they're
from the brand mink pink and yeah I
really like them but the other pair that
I've been loving they're from the brand
roc-roc
and they look like that I am obsessed
with these I think they look so good on
their just like they make me feel like
just such a diva you know if you saw any
of my Paris stuff I was wearing my block
Brixton hat throughout Paris so I bought
a green one this one I got in a small my
other ones a medium I think the small is
actually better but it looks like this I
love these hats think they complete it a
lot of outfits and they're really good
for fall I like this one better than my
block one I think I might have to get
another block one in a smaller size cuz
this one just makes is like way better
on my head and then I haven't tried any
this stuff on yet so when I try it on
for this video will be the first time
that I tried on oh I also another
accessory I got these little glittery
socks they kind of look weird and they
might seem like a really weird purchase
for me but I thought they could be cool
with their like sheer um with like
strappy heels for winter I don't know I
saw like Tommy song doing it or
something and I was like
got to do that it's really cool okay on
to close now first thing I got red faux
leather pants look at these these have
like oh I really like the way that um oh
the other from the brand I'm Gia which
is a brand that's blowing up right now I
think it's like a blogger or youtubers
Brad not sure they're like a stretchy
material so they can be comfy on I feel
like they're gonna make my butt look
good but I'm not sure I got them in a
small which was a size eight I got so I
got my red and I also go through the
black because why not
same pant with this place up detailing
on the front the zippers on the ankle
and they just think they're gonna be so
good for fall and for winter going out
day I just love the length of faux
leather yeah what else do they get from
vintage poly on the topic topic faux
leather I also got this faux leather
skirt this is in a size six and the
brand mink pink has a zipper in the
front I think this will be really nice
for going out or just like with a pair
of sneakers for the fall time excited to
wear this excited to file this for you
guys definitely I was pretty out of the
ordinary for me but I've been seeing
these cut types of dresses everywhere
and I kind of wanted to try one out I
thought it could be cool for like maybe
Thanksgiving or something I don't know
how I don't know if he's gonna fit me I
got it in a size 8 it looks a little
short looks kind of like a shirt but
it's like this gangam style wrap dress
um I feel like we were what wears stuff
like this all the time it's from the
brand my girl size 8 and yeah I thought
it would be something different for my
wardrobe I feel like my wardrobes fill
it with basics because I love to have a
good basic wardrobe and then but that
would be like a good addition to my
wardrobe this is my black Brixton huh
you can get that on princess Polly as
well but I need to get a smaller size
the next thing I got is this jumpsuit
and I thought this would be great for
like winter events it is strapless
jumpsuit with this frill on the top and
then it has like a wide leg culotte
bottom I got this in a size small it
doesn't tell you anything I think I got
this in a size 8 but I think this would
be really nice for you know winter
events I have a lot of those just black
I can wear it to like multiple events oh
my god totally throught I got another
bosses these are from ki I kinda look
like a bug in them but I like them a lot
they're really cool they're like a
different take on the ray-bans that I
always wear and I like to have different
styles of sunglasses I feel like they
really change up your outfit the last
thing that I got is this shirt from the
brand mink pink I got in a size 8 I'm
pretty sure and it's a blue eye I
thought it was button up but it actually
has no buttons so it just ties in the
front I was gonna like try to wear this
during the day but this is gonna be a
lot of boobies I could probably put a
bralette underneath or something but I
mean this color I'm gonna be really in
for winter so let's go to top shops I
have everything here right now so the
first thing I did was I we got my
Topshop Jamie jeans a lot of people were
asking in my morning routine what jeans
I was wearing and these are the talk
shop Jamie jeans and I got them in a 25
waist and a 34 leg they used to only be
cropped at the bottom and it really
bothered me they've now made them long
so I don't really like the cropped pants
to be honest I like them to be full
length so these are great because these
are full length 34 and I can put them
over top of my boots but if you are not
my size or whatever they have petits and
they also have tall so you can get a
bunch of different lengths in these
pants they're my favorite jeans they fit
so nicely on the bum on the waist
amazing I love these jeans I also love
for black jeans All Saints stilt jeans
I'm thinking about getting another pair
in black so I can have more than one
pair of black jeans the next thing I got
at Topshop which if you follow me an
Instagram you would have seen me wear
this I got this pink suit I saw on a
song wearing a pink suit so I got a
piece I think this would be really great
for events and I can use the Blazer
separately I can wear just the pants
like it's just a great thing to have
because you can wear both pieces and I
think this suit was $200 together like
$100 each piece maybe but I'm obsessed
with it I got the Blazer in a size 6 the
pants I got in a size 4 I probably
should have gone to spice too they just
didn't have it but the forest wine just
fits my life fits my bomb and I was
gonna have to waist take it in so
absolutely loves
I got two things from a ritzy ax the
first is a black sleeveless turtleneck
you saw this in my fall outfits video I
got this in a size small I shouldn't
bought an extra small just cuz I wanted
it to be a little bit tighter than it is
it stretches out a bit so I should
definitely should have gotten an extra
small but I think this is a really great
layering piece for winter it's great in
the fall because it makes you still look
fall but if it's still it's still too
like cold up or sorry I'm still too warm
out swear like a full turtleneck it's a
great piece but I love layering this I
love the look of this under a blazer I
love the look of this under like a white
button-up shirt but the Blazer is also
great for this because so I got really
hot like I am always running at like a
very high temperature so this is great
because I can wear this under a blazer
and not feel super hall I think the
sleeves and stuff then I also got this
bodysuit it's like a lacy lingerie type
piece bodysuit it's a little itchy the
back is lace a little bit of G but I can
deal with it and I think this is really
nice under Blazers like high-waisted
pants under white blazer I've seen a lot
of people wearing stuff like this and I
know since I know and I think it's
really nice
next is Zara I actually was speaking to
someone the speaking to the creative
director of LPA revolve PF and I asked
her a few questions about Zara because
if you know her story she interviews are
right before and like who's gonna get a
job at Zara like high level job at Zara
before revolve approached her for LPA so
I needed to know from a reliable source
what Bazaar was all about behind the
scenes and she told me that they treat
their workers well they have good clean
and stable factories so that made me
feel really good unfortunately they are
still a fast fashion brand so I only buy
pieces from Zara that I know that I'll
keep my wardrobe for a long time
but it was really nice to know that they
are an actual good company and I also
read something not by 2020 they're
looking to be fully fully good so their
packaging is now all like a sustainable
packaging and they're just looking to be
a better companies that made me really
happy especially for a big chain store
like Zara anyway this blazer I'm sure
you've seen it everywhere it's a double
breasted blazer don't feel like you need
to buy one of these Blazers from za
right you can thrift these super easily
I really want needed one quickly for
something and I didn't have time to go
thrifting for it so I just picked one of
my sorrows or has a few different
checkered with this gray check even that
brown check even that brown check is
really really in for fall
so speaking of check I also got these
pants from Zara I got these for Paris
and they have a high waist oh the thing
I hate about that blazer that I just
showed you is there's no pockets and
they're all just fake pockets and I
really really hate that so the boys are
not having pockets is annoying the pants
have pockets but just need these pants
way better for me plus for me they have
a belt here I don't the minute extra
small I really like them I think they
look chic
fuck another thing you are from Zara
like a while ago but I know it is still
available and you did see them my fault
if it's as well is this knit little
sweater set this is the top it also
comes with pants I'm not sure the pants
part right now but it comes with pants
and I really like this together I love
wearing it with Gucci slides I also love
rank with those like these boots I'm
gonna show you next I just think it
looks really nice it's really
comfortable but still really chic who's
I'm going to show you are these boots
very they look very impractical I'm
still breaking them in so I need like
these are very pointy at that so your
toes are squished but they're really
nice and I actually like to wear them
not high I like to scrunch them down so
very like 80s 90s sort of thing you know
like scrunch down but I love the navy
color or blue color I think it's really
nice and I also love wearing those
builds with this dress which is from
Zara as well it's just like a MIDI knit
dress tank top form those boots I also
have like
I have a vintage cashmere turtleneck
dress I think those boots will be so
nice when it's like freezing cold I'm
uncle we just launched our camo jacket
that says love Rosa on it and it's just
a nice vintage camo I wear my camo
jacket all the time - something
different in the box it's from a
previous season but I love a good camera
jacket this with like I have showed you
an outfit in my fall outfits but like
black pants or white shirt even the red
pants could be really cool it there's
just it camos doesn't get a neutral and
I just I love it so it has a flower
patch on the back which I'm really
really obsessive Lee gives more that fit
to G vibe and then we it's all hand done
hand drawn so if you don't follow me on
Instagram or you don't fall the uncle
account you wouldn't know this but we
also dropped a waffle this is inside-out
but a waffle MIDI dress it's long-sleeve
it hits about well depends on tall you
are but it hits about like me or mid
calf area it has a slit up the side
where is that slit has a slit up the
side here and it's a thermal cotton
material I'm obsessed with this dress we
have it in black and we also have it in
a natural color I love it I love wearing
with converse you can dress it up with
those boots even like they're just so
many ways you can wear it and it can
really take you from casual to more
dressed up so I'm obsessed with the
dress that we made you should really
check it out because it's a really good
quality piece that could be a staple in
your wardrobe the next thing is a jacket
this isn't gonna be launching until late
October so keep an eye out for this but
this is our new uncle coat this is the
white gray mix we'll also have it in
black obviously because everyone needs a
good black coat in their wardrobe it
doesn't have any buttons so it's really
like a throw piece we are gonna be
making belts for it so you can close it
it has really big pockets on the outside
which I really really like this coat is
great for traveling is you can throw
like your passport and anything in those
pockets just have it for you all the
time
Joe just warden yeah so this is just a
really great versatile code will be
dropping and the next thing triangle
sent to me I'm just gonna show you
Instagram picture actually
they just ride on as well this is a
brand new one but they gave me this
bikini sedan no style bikini with key
buttons I love this beginning I think
it's super flattering on I did size up
in the top for my yellow I was getting
an extra small and I got a small and
just like covers my boobs more but it's
a little big around like the ribcage so
probably upside get it take it in but
this color is really pretty and yeah I
wore Denise's right necks and then the
last and final item in the most
expensive item that I've ever purchased
clothing wise is my Chloe Minnie Fay
backpack I am obsessed with this bag
show me I can hear you slobbering this
is the Chloe Minnie Fay backpack this
was so great when traveling just because
like I couldn't fit I can actually fit a
lot in here I could fit my camera I can
fit my phone and the makeup literally
everything it has a backpack capability
but also has a purse capability so it
was perfect travel bag I got in black
just because why would I not get it in
black the brown ones really really nice
though really nice I actually got this
secondhand on bestir collective have a
link in the description if you want to
check them out but you don't care about
buying secondhand bags I think bestir
collective is a great way to buy
second-hand designer bag also the real
real is very similar but I had a really
great experience with them you may see
like bit on a bag or a bit on whatever
you want they have clothes they have
everything and then your offer gets
accepted the person who's selling your
item send the to bestir collective they
authenticate everything and then they
send it to you so I am totally fine with
buying used designer I'd rather save
some money
my clearly fake mini backpack so happy
with that I think that's it for me yeah
I hope you guys enjoyed this video thank
you so much watching love you all peace
love
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
