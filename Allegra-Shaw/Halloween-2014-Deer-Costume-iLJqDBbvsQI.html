how to get this quick dear costume just
basically with makeup you don't really
need that much costume so I'm just
taking a white face paint this one's
actually really bad i don't recommend it
it was like to choose one of the costume
store but just take a white face paint
and a brush and kind of make a mask over
your eyes and a little on your nose
it's then to get the waiter on the eyes
it just took a fluffy brush I think
that's the one that comes their urban
decay naked palette so just to get like
really in the crevices I take a little
brush and then to kind of blend it out
i'm going to take just a i don't want
that scalding stippling brush or
something and then i'll eventually get
the Beauty Blender right here and I just
had it all down to make sure it's smooth
okay and then I took my darkest bronzer
if you can find dark Blake brown face
paint I think that'd be better this is
actually smells really good so I wasn't
too sad about it it's the two-faced
bronzer and like truffle I don't know it
smells delicious I forgot what it is but
it's just as dark as possible then you
want to just go around your face with
that dark product
so as you see here I'm just making it
really dark just around the mask making
it very dear like
you
so I just kept making it darker and
darker until I want it now I'm going
back with the white and just kind of
blending the two colors together so it's
not like this harsh line and then taking
be blundering again just kind of lending
it all together man i just wanted to set
the bronzer because is kind of sticky
and in order to move so i just took the
hoola bronzer with a kabuki brush and
just press it over the dark just make a
little darker and make it set
and then with the white I took the data
brushes using the book fluffy brush
brush and this is actually really hard
to do with the space makeup that's why I
think that you could definitely find
another one so maybe one of the liquid e
ones we did and you just want to create
little dots I think if it before all you
see just little dots on the side of your
face and you'll do that on both sides
and then I do it on my forehead as well
so now I'm doing the forehead dots and
as you see this will be on the white so
you just want to make it as dark as you
can so there's some contrast between the
whites now I'm just taking a dark brown
shadow on just a I think that's a
foundation brush and I'm contouring with
the dark brown shot huh
and now still taking that dark brown
shadow i'm just going to contour my nose
up into my eyebrows and kind of connect
those and then i will blend it out
so I kind of skip forward here I didn't
put this partition see there's seven
people my apartment at this time but
what I did is I just going over the
contour with a black line and then I
color it in the bottom of my nose with
black and then I outlined my eyes and
then just brought it down a little bit
like an animal and now I'm just putting
white on my waterline
to make sure all the white is actually
white and putting some black wire but if
you have thinner eyebrows you could do
your whole library why I version was
thick so it's a really hard to it just
look really weird fighting my whole
eyebrow black and then what you want to
do I don't show this video but i just
put mascara on and black eyeliner oh my
tight line and that looks great and here
are the finished results that is what my
face looked like so cute that's with my
antlers and then I just wore a nude
bodysuit and I put white dots and stuff
I go on my body and it looked really
cute remember to subscribe hope you guys
like this video and I'll talk to you
soon happy Halloween</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
