makeup tutorial it is a skull obviously
takes quite a bit of time but I think
it's well worth it and it's super cheap
you need like just a few products and
you can just wear all black or you wear
all white or you could wear whatever you
want and it's a really really easy
simple Halloween look and a bunch of
people i know did an Oscar and it looked
epic so um yeah this is how it turned
out and yeah I hope you guys enjoyed the
video wait you have a watch to get so
how could you enjoy it I hope you guys
enjoyed this video so I'm first starting
out by priming my face with a remote
primer you can use any primer for this
but if you're gonna be using it all
night you definitely want to prime then
I'm putting a white bed night cream all
over my face I didn't do very good job I
suggest making it way way way more white
than I did now i'm taking a Ben I black
pencil thing and I'm just carving out my
eye sockets I went over my eyebrows
because I have thick eyebrows it's hard
to conceal them with white so I'm making
my sockets a little bit bigger than they
should be next I am carving out my nose
you can just feel around your nose to
make make it how your actual nose would
look
and then I am roughly just carving out
where the cheekbones will be I will go
back to this but I just want to have
like an estimate now i'm taking a liquid
liner and i'm starting to create the
teeth by just creating thin lines across
my mouth
now I'm going to take a grey eyeshadow
and I'm going to create these little
sticks little v-shape sticks coming out
of each line on the upper and lower as
well as in between the upper and lower
so here you can see what i mean by just
creating that v-shape in between the two
sets of teeth and it kind of creates
like a diamond like effect and now I'm
just blending these out by extending the
V and making it a little bigger and more
dramatic
so this looks really all about depth so
I'm just grabbing some more black and
putting it where I think it needs to be
a little darker then grabbing that
pencil brush again and just blending it
out
you
now I'm taking a big fluffy brush and
just blending everything together now
you want to grab some more white and
really carve out the teeth so any place
that a tooth would be you want to put
some more white and then you want to
drag it down a little bit to create a
point which will look like the roots of
the teeth
now I'm going back in it's a lick of
liquid liner and I am just kind of
carving out some teeth that I want to
show a little more and then taking a
black but I cream and just putting it
all over the eye sockets as well as the
nose
wanted to add a little more depth to the
teeth this block is very black so I just
went in to create a little more depth
now on to the cheekbones I just kind of
felt out where my cheekbones were and i
created the hollows of my cheeks with
the black this is just a process they
need to figure out what it looks best on
your own face but bring the cheekbones
down around the jaw because that'll
connect it all together my face wasn't
wide enough I really screwed up this
first step so make sure your face is
white enough so you don't have to go
back in with the white
I'm just adding a few more teeth to kind
of make it look more realistic and then
blending the block out of the cheekbones
again adding more white because of my
first mistake you don't have to do this
step but I think it makes a little more
realistic I'm just adding lines
throughout the skull to make a little
more scary and kind of making the eye
sockets a little pointy adding some
hollows in my temple area and then
blending that out as well so it's not so
harsh
and now I'm kind of creating this like
mad skull look we're kind of looks like
you're frowning so just going in and
making some swirls on the forehead
take a pencil liner I'm just filling on
my waterline and I'm grabbing some
mascara as well to make it extra block
and to make my eyes pop a little bit
more and then you are done</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
