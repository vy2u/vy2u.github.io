video I think it's gonna be so funny
my hair's kind of crazy today I'm hoping
the shower after this so okay so I am
doing by the challenge the how I did my
makeup in high school challenge and I
don't usually do challenges but I
thought this would be so funny because I
actually did YouTube in high school so I
have like full-on proof and like I have
step-by-step instructions of how I did
my makeup in high school so this one is
actually a little different and you need
some space to put the box right here I'm
gonna put my first ever youtube via that
everyone up on my channel I'm gonna use
my guide to do my makeup and I have
socks numbers I have a few of the
products that I actually use in this
video I still have them why do I have my
no but I'm just like swap them out I
don't know this is me so funny okay
achieve this look really basic really
simple then keep watching thanks thanks
okay so I used a Mac foundation this is
my I'm doing the first ever YouTube
video I know this changes I have another
one like later on but this I was very
pale I'm a very pale person naturally I
feel like my tan has faded a bit so this
is good okay so I don't have that Mac
foundation but I have this NARS radiant
tinted moisturizer which is very light
and it's high-end as well so use that
and I use
a that use like a classic foundation
brush or do fiber brush into I use a duo
fiber brush somebody is this so and I
just uh you know put it all over my face
keep watching it I remember I got all of
that like those mac brush sets I got it
for Christmas so I was like feeling my
makeup skills you know little voiceover
hello oh I put it down my neck you know
my chest as well okay okay so I use the
Victoria Secret concealer in the video I
don't think Jory secret still solves
makeup maybe they do I don't know but I
know that I had this time bomb concealer
in high school so it's very old so I'm
gonna use it and I just dabbed it under
my eyes very lightly I like that boom
that hard Katie Collett that was a good
palette that was a palette so I just put
it just right under the eye like this
and then I worked it on top of my lids
as well
I'm actually pretty impressed to me on
some high school like I didn't look
crazy I don't think I need think
sometimes when I went out and I put
eyeshadow on and I know I put some just
around my nose very professional Allegra
and then I said anywhere I had redness
so so I put some white chin okay good
good job so I did use powder I usually
use the covergirl trublend or the
covergirl true match I think powders
trublend head sparkle in it why did I
use that and but I know that I also went
use to spare men all one when I was in
my mom's makeup so I'm going to use this
and I used a cougar on a kabuki brush so
pretty hat impressed myself I was sorry
to L'Oreal True Match Laura Moser
because I was called back a little bit
so I put it on my brush and then I would
blend it and then I even like would put
it on my eyes
Oh God
may not look really bad in the camera
but like I don't look good trying to
exact movements of this video - you can
put it down my neck and on my chest and
deaf my under my eyes definitely still
have that watch another time I used the
Tories secret bronzer I remember any is
all Victoria Secret product so that's
what the models would use in the fashion
show I thought that was like the coolest
thing ever so I used the Victoria's
Secret bronzer I think it was in goddess
and it was shimmery but this one's very
similarities as the NYX once I'm going
to use that and I used it on a massive
nasty duo fiber brush from quo so I'm
just gonna I just picked up another
brush I don't have a July one and I put
bronzer all over my face that's what I
did oh okay I struggled with the 3b and
then I just didn't so I did the 3d
motion
and then I go like this that's literally
what I do in the video and then he
everywhere
because I'm not going to do it bronzer
face up really kale down my neck chest
just in glows oh really carving out
freebie here it's like a highway oh good
there but we're taking the lightest
color and we're using the Sun hynny the
highlight or about hand a little darker
okay so we're taking the places we're
doing highlights with the bronzer okay
so I actually go on tour in this video I
think this is what in contouring just
like was starting to become a thing and
I'm using the benefit hoola bronzer so
congrats to me on this and I'm taking an
angle brush mine was a Mac like one that
Christmas set and um taking some of my
brush oh right there
okay okay okay I'm so cute okay so I
just he kit and
I just really got in there blended it
out like the good makeup artist I am and
then I show you the difference and I do
the other side
okay so for blush I used the Bobbi Brown
it was called sandstorm wanna use that
I'm not for like years I had sample size
and used it for years so I have this
other Bobbi Brown brought blush called
brown berries and use that and I
actually still have the exact same brush
that I used I use this for tanning now
but yeah so I just took it and put it
over cheeks
and then I still have the same NARS
orgasm with the exact same one and I put
that over top
no rhyme or reason and then I used a
covergirl highlight server mascara so
I'm just going to use this NYC one that
I have on me and I'm just gonna put this
mascara remember it didn't actually use
that much mascara
there's no eyelash pearl there was no
eyeliner it was just a nice small dose
of mascara that I think it was pretty
appropriate and that is my high school
makeup I mean it's actually not that bad
I had my hair up in the video but I mean
I think that's pretty good for like when
I didn't know anything I didn't know
