inspired what hey guys so today I filmed
this holiday New Year's kind of makeup
look dark lip really pretty eye and I
think it turned out really nice I'm
really happy with it so it's kind of
like a chatty makeup look I have done
with these really long time so if you
want to know how to achieve this look
you can keep watching I thought I'd if
I'm to do a little chitchat
um makeup look 71 throw something really
long time so I'm gonna start out with
primer this is the derma logic drew
logica Dermalogica hydro blur primer and
this is phenomenal amazing so I'm just
gonna stir crazy
it really blurs everything out and it's
actually great to just wear out and so
on as well if you don't really want to
wear makeup and then I'm gonna be using
the Clinique beyond perfecting
foundation and concealer now this one is
way too dark for me right now so I
bought the lightening shade drops from
body shop and this is actually
incredible incredible stuff it changes
your foundation to a lighter color and I
definitely need that because my skin
tone changes so much from summer to
winter so what I do is I just take some
of this put on my hand
that so you can tell it's like such a
dark color for me and then need to take
something job I think my applicator
might be broken but you just take some
of these drops and you just drop it in
and it's supposed to also take the
yellow out I mean I kind of like a
yellow foundation so I don't it is pink
colored so I don't definitely neutralize
any of your foundation no you can put as
many drops as you need I really need
this to be way lighter because I bought
the wrong shade in the first place so I
just do that I'm gonna see my Beauty
Blender but usually I'd take like a
stick you just mix it together but it
like completely changes color we're just
really cool so
I'm just patting this on to get the full
coverage look that I want probably going
to use one squeeze more but it's not bad
it's pretty accurate then I'm taking my
two favorite concealers this is the
Maybelline each instant rewind for my
under eyes and then the Revlon Colorstay
these are great drugstore concealers and
I'm just gonna put them under my eyes
and on any blemishes that I have
and then again taking my Beauty Blender
you definitely throw a powder on top if
you wanted I don't really want to so I'm
gonna do that today but if you wanted to
really make it set and lasts all night I
would definitely recommend just throwing
a powder on top of that I'm actually
gonna go right into the eyes now and
then finish my face after I'm going to
start by taking this crease color it is
the Rimmel London magnifies all about
the base and I'm just gonna be - taking
a fluffy brush and putting this in the
crease
then I'm taking this Maybelline eye
studio makeup in copper Sheik and I'm
gonna take the coppery color right there
and I'm gonna put that on my base just
really lightly though I'm not gonna pack
on the color I'm gonna kind of sweep it
on so it gives just a nice shimmery
coppery effect instead of like a natural
color
and then I'm going to take the lightest
color in this palette the white and I'm
going to actually pack that on it's a
very nice color on top of the cobbler
I'm going to take a clean blending brush
and I'm going to blend metal
and then gonna take that brush that I
was using at the beginning and I'm gonna
use the Rimmel London VIP pass color and
it's just this like shimmery sort of
brown and I'm just gonna take a little
bit I'm into the brush and I'm gonna
just deepen up the outer corners a
little bit
I'm then gonna take the Rimmel London
eyeshadow in queue jump which is like a
really shimmery white on this tiny
little brush and this is going to be the
inner corner highlight
I'm going to take that clean blending
brush again and just blend everything
out again
now that odor be color I'm just going to
take a little bit of that and and put it
under my eyes just to kind of complete
the look and bring it around town feel
me
just going to go with my D blender and
kind of clean up the under-eye area
I'm now gonna add some black eyeliner to
the tight line and some white eyeliner
to the waterline as well as mascara to
my eyelashes obviously
in the L'Oreal telescopic mascara I love
this mascara I'm a little on the bottom
as well
eyes are actually now done now what eyes
are done all right so let's finish the
rest of the face I'm going to take the
Bobbi Brown bronzer in natural and I'm
going to contour a little bit
I'm gonna add some blush the blush I'm
using is Tarte flush it's like this
purpley color it's a really pretty color
and it's very great pigmented
and then gonna take my favorite product
ever Mac soft and gentle and I'm gonna
do it just a little highlight
I'm just going to take this toilet as
well and do that on my brow bone
and
I know I'm just gonna take a big angle
fluffy brush and just blend everything
out for the lips we're gonna do a
mixture of two lipsticks that are MAC
lipsticks rebel and sin my two favorite
dark lipsticks we're gonna mix them
together to create this dark purple
color is he this universal lip liner
this will just help the product not
bleed
and I thought dark lipsticks really do
bleed
so just creating a barrier around the
lips I really like the universal clear
lip liners I think they're really nice
we are not taking spin on a lip brush
this is just the dull iam tools lip
brush and we are going to carefully
apply sin all over the lips
when you're wearing a dark lipstick oh
my god it takes so much time to put it
on and make sure it's like amazing this
messy lipsticks with my biggest
and then you want to take rebel and do
the basically things up seeing this
thing and just go over it if you had a
really dark purple like cyber iMac I
think it's a good one you can do that
but I actually just don't have a really
dark purple so I'm kind of just using
these two to create the effect that I
want
so the lipsticks are on and it's not
really hmm that's not really clean so
I'm just kind of cleaning it up now then
I was going to take my Beauty Blender
and clean up around the edges or you
could take a brush with some concealer
on it that works as well oh my god I
just got someone my face
and I'm gonna highlight my Cupid's bow
with soft and gentle back and get right
in there so that it looks really clean
and that is the finished makeup look so
it's my turn it great Wow
obviously you do your eyebrows if you
wanted to I just don't really ever do my
eyebrows I'm over ass brush them out but
that's it just this really nice holiday
makeup look and I think it's great for
holiday parties or even New Year's Eve
although if you're gonna kissing someone
on New Year's Eve and men wearing dark
lipstick but that is all I hope you guys
