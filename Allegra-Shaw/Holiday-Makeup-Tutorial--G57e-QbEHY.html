inspired what hey guys so today I foam
this holiday New Year's kind of makeup
look dark lip really pretty eye and I
think it turned out really nice I'm
really happy with it so it's kind of
like a chit chatty makeup look I have
done with these really long time so if
you want to know how to achieve this
look you can keep watching I thought
only fun to do a little chitchat and
makeup look 71 throw some really long
time so I'm going to start out with
primer this is the dermo logic drew
logica dermalogica hydro blur primer and
this is phenomenal amazing so just gonna
start raising that
it really blurs everything out and it's
actually great to just wear out and so
on as well if you don't really want to
wear make up a little bit and then I'm
going to be using the clinic beyond
perfecting foundation and concealer now
this one is way too dark for me right
now so i bought the lightning shade
drops from body shop and this is
actually incredible incredible stuff it
changes your foundation to a later color
and I definitely need that because my
skin tone changes so much from summer to
winter so what I do is it just take some
of this put on my hand
that so you can tell it's like such a
dark color for me and then need to take
something Joe pending my applicator
might be broken but you just take some
of these drops and you just drop it in
and it's supposed to also take the
yellow out I mean I kind of like a
yellow foundation so I don't it is pink
colored so I don't definitely neutralize
any of your foundation now you can put
as many drops as you need I really need
this to be way later because i bought
the wrong shade in the first place so I
just do that I'm going to see my Beauty
Blender but usually I take like a stick
and just mix it together but it like
completely changes color just really
cool so
I'm just patting this on to get the full
coverage look that I want probably going
to use one squeeze more but it's not bad
it's pretty accurate then i'm taking my
two favorite concealers this is the
Maybelline age and it's rewind for my
under eyes and then the Revlon Colorstay
these are great drugstore concealers and
I'm just going to put them under my eyes
and on any blemishes that I have
and then again taking my beauty blender
you definitely throw a powder on top if
you wanted I don't really want to so I'm
going to do that today but if you wanted
to really make it set and last all night
I would definitely recommend just
throwing a powder on top of that i'm
actually going to go right into the eyes
now and then finish my face after i'm
going to start by taking this crease
color it is the Rimmel London magnifies
all about the base and I'm going to be
true taking a fluffy brush and putting
this in the crease
then I'm taking this Maybelline eye
studio makeup in copper chic and I'm
going to take the coppery color right
there and I'm going to put that on my
base just really lightly though i'm not
going to pack on the color I'm going to
kind of sweep it on so it gives just a
nice shimmery Capri effect instead of
like a natural color
and then I'm going to take the lightest
color in this palette the white and I'm
going to actually pack that on it's a
very nice color on top of the Culver
you
I'm going to take a clean blending brush
and I'm going to blend model
I'm then going to take that brush that I
was using at the beginning and I'm going
to use the Rimmel London VIP pass color
and it's just this like shimmery sort of
brown and I'm just going to take a
little bit i'm in the brush and I'm
going to just deepen up the outer
corners a little bit
I'm then going to take the rimmel london
eye shadow in queue jump which is like a
really shimmery white on this tiny
little brush and this is going to be the
inner corner highlight
I'm going to take that clean blending
brush again and just blend everything
out again
now that outer V color I'm just going to
take a little bit of that and and put it
under my eyes just to kind of complete
the look and bring it around town feel
me
I'm just going to go with my gay blender
and kind of clean up the under eye area
I'm now going to add some black eyeliner
to the tight line and some white
eyeliner to the waterline as well as
mascara to my eyelashes obviously
in the L'Oreal telescopic mascara i love
this mascara I'm a little on the bottom
as well eyes are actually now done now
what eyes are done alright so let's
finish the rest of the face I'm going to
take the Bobby Brown bronzer in natural
and I'm going to contour a little bit
I'm gonna add some blush the blush I'm
using is tart flush it's like this
purple in color it's really pretty color
and it's very great pigmented
and then going to take my favorite
product ever Mac soft and gentle and I'm
going to do just a little highlight
I'm just going to take this highlight as
well and do that on my brow bone
and
I know I'm just going to take a big
angle fluffy brush and just blend
everything out for the lips we're going
to do a mixture of two lipsticks that
are mac lipsticks rebel and sin my two
favorite dark lipsticks we're going to
mix them together to create this dark
purple color take this Universal lip
liner this will just help the product
not bleed and I fav dark lipsticks
really do bleed
just creating a barrier around the lips
I really like the universal clear lip
liners I think they're really nice we
are not taking sin on a lip brush this
is just the gallium tools lip brush and
we are going to carefully applies in all
over the lips
when you're wearing a dark lipstick oh
my god it takes so much time to put it
on make sure it's like amazing messy
lipsticks with my biggest keys
and then you want to take rebel and do
the basically things up seeing this
thing and just go over if you had a
really dark purple like um cyber my mac
i think is a good one you can do that
but i actually just don't have a really
dark purple so I'm kind of just using
these two to create the effect that I
bought
so the lipsticks are on but it's not
really hmm that's not really clean so
I'm just kind of cleaning it up now then
I was going to take my Beauty Blender
and clean up around the edges or you can
take a brush with some concealer on it
that works as well oh my god i just got
someone my face
and I'm going to highlight my Cupid's
bow with soft and gentle by Mac you get
right in there so that it looks really
clean
and that is the finished makeup look so
it's much love it I turned it great Wow
obviously you do your eyebrows if you
want into I just don't really ever do my
eyebrows will parse brush them out but
that's it um just this really nice
holiday makeup look and I think it's
great for holiday parties or even New
Year's Eve um although if you're gonna
kissing someone with New Year's Eve in
my not wearing dark lipstick but that is
all I hope you guys enjoyed this video
