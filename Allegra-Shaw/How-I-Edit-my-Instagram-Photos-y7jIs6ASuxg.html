edit my Instagram photos video um right
now I have the eye iPhone 6 I use I have
a bull photography folder but the two
main apps that I use our facetune and
vsco cam I have a ton of other ones that
I never use them and I use the Instagram
layout app as well sometimes but base to
Nabisco cam or are you literally the
only ones that I use so actually taking
the photo
any selfies so like pick everyone knows
about selfies I don't try to explain
what selfie is any selfies I usually
take on the camera that I'm filming on
now against a white wall I like a clear
image or yeah I try to sing like most of
my pictures on this if I can but if I'm
like actually out doing something and
I'm actually like using its term for
that's for for like posting a picture of
what you're doing at that time I just
use my camera on my phone but what I do
is before so I'm taking in the picture
on my actual phone I always clean the
lens first so just clean it on here and
then I make sure that you know the
picture is gonna sort of fit my theme so
I try to like incorporate the grays and
the whites cuz my theme right now is
kind of like that white grey sort of
theme honest I'm really bad of keeping a
theme I have no idea like what's like
what's going on so like sometimes it
like fits perfectly and then I'll post
one photo and it doesn't fit my theme it
all the like whatever who cares yeah so
always wipe off your lens and try to get
the best lighting possible good lighting
iPhone photos worse bad lighting iPhone
photos is a world of difference like if
you're in bad light your iPhone photo
will look like you're on an iPhone 4 and
then a pretty good light it'll make it
look like it's taken with like a DSLR so
so let's get right into the actual
editing process if sending myself the
pictures so I'm just going to show you
how this is like the one of my
instagrams I did I'm just going to show
you how I did this picture so I'm just
gonna save that picture and I send it
from my computer to my iPhone and then
what I will do
is I will I will go here and go to face
tomb and I will open the photo that I
want so this one and yeah so it looks
like this and then what I'll do is I'll
go right here and take the whitening the
teeth whitening tool and I will white
the whole background sorry this is
really shaky I will just wipe the whole
background ok sure in here my video now
obviously like I'll be a little more
precise when I'm doing it but I should
put my phone in airplane mode I'm sorry
basically you get the idea though so
that now yellow background is now fully
white and I think it looks great
so then what I'll do is I mean I feel
like I don't really need to edit
anything else but well like zoom into my
face and if anything's like bothering me
I'll fix it but nothing's really
bothering me but I'll take go to the
details up and I'll usually just go over
my eyes and then you can see like it
just makes your eyes glow and I really
like that in pictures so it really does
make a difference and then that's what
I'll do there and like I mean I don't
really think I need anything like looks
good to me so that's all I'll do and
facetune it's all I really use so I'll
go and I will save the photo to camera
roll and then I'll go to vsco cam what I
love about vsco cam
other than all the filters I love that
you can see what your Instagram role is
gonna look like here so you know you can
check to see that all the pictures kind
of go together so I used to be a cool
theme and then I transferred into white
so I'm going to teach you kind of how to
do both so what I'll do is I'll add the
photo and then I will go to right here
they have all the presets and the one
that I use now is a six and for a selfie
I'll bring it down to like six but
anything else I usually give it at 12
like all my filler photos or photos of
things that are not my face
um so this is what I do for my team now
and if a photo doesn't really match the
theme sometimes they go black and white
but this one matches my selfie theme
that I have going on for the cooler
theme if you want to go that route which
is my old theme I really liked H be a 1
and H be a 2 and P 5 is if you're gonna
go like really really cool and I also
like the T 1 filter but a 6 is what I'm
using now so go to sorry go to a 6 bring
it down to but 6 then I'll go into the
little wrench and I'll bring up you know
the I'll just like clear out fit this
one I actually won't bring the contrast
down or at the brightness down maybe
bring the contrast up and then anytime
bring the contrast up I actually bring
the fade up just a little bit so bring
that up to 3 does really need anything
else I'll also like this tool which is a
skin tone tool so you can kind of make
your skin more like green toned or a red
toned if you see this is good for other
pictures but this one this doesn't need
that so there we go
I guess it's alleged it a little bit
differently than this one but you know I
think
has a little more bright so then I will
then check to see how that looks with my
theme that I'll save it to camera roll
and the largest size and then I will go
to Instagram and I'll figure out how I
want to set it so I mean I like this
little tool there's all this also like
the layout it's open in layout where you
can do like all this fun stuff where
I've done this before I don't know you
know you know the drill but we're not
gonna do that
for this picture okay go back certainly
like that press next and then I take the
Sun I usually bring the Sun to about 23
and then I go into the wrench and I
bring the brightness up a little bit
probably to about 23 25 I'll play around
with it see how I like it
and then I'll fill in all this and then
I'll post the photo and this is what my
current Instagram looks like theme-wise
pretty cool so if you want a little
Instagram theme like this you can follow
this tutorial and get a cool Instagram
theme like this otherwise you do you
rock your own Instagram follow me on
Instagram
follow me on Twitter as well and I'd
really appreciate it if you also like my
Facebook page I'm trying to up my likes
on that otherwise I love you thanks for
watching talk to you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
