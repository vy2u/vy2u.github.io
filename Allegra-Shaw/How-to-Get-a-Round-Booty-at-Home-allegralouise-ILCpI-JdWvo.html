routine I'm just going to kind of
explain my workout situation so
basically I work out at a gym usually
but this some days that I'm pretty lazy
and lately that's been quite often I
actually work out really far from my
house so in the middle of changing gym
membership somewhere closer to where I
live
cuz I've been working out my gym my
apartment gym quite often and the gym
sucks like it's the worst room in the
world they have no weight they barely
have machines like it's a joke so what
I'm going to do today is I'm going to
show you like a workout routine that you
could do in your home you do when you're
traveling you could do like in your
apartment gym or anything like that and
then I will also film a a like inside
the gym workout routine when I switch
gym because this the jizan I'm going to
24 hours so I'll be able to film without
people being there because I'm like too
in I think it's one four hours so this
video is going to be split into two
parts the first one being my home leg
workout and then second one being my at
home ab workout I obviously haven't
mastered upper body without doing
weights or anything so you guys are not
going to see that so this video is like
next video ops stop the camera was set
up better than this but they don't have
a treadmill in this gym so I just used
the old twelve I hate the elliptical but
I just want to get my blood pumping my
heart rate up so I just go on this for
about five minutes and I do aq and a
half minutes going forward and then two
and a half minutes form back and I just
really want to amp my heart rate and
also like warm up like glutes so you can
see them kind of like squatting down and
doing it just really want to warm up
everything if you don't have an
elliptical jumping jacks are great you
can do like those beings
anything is cute burpees like I didn't
even just get your heart rate up you can
also look like the tube and the terms of
like at home cardio workout so anything
is just like it's jumping and getting
your heart rate cops being around socks
kept skipping the movement and rivet
eyes so did you that but I just get on
me let's go for five minutes is just
publicist Harvey
so after cardio I be constructing my
body was so sore like my hamstrings are
so tight so I will mainly just stretch
your legs since they're usually work out
and then I like to also pulse when I
stretch to like you butterflies and this
is going to for the hawk construction
education soul cannot stretch
constructed though whatever your to to
stretch out and then I'll show you my
back and panning in the police is all
about good stuff but the question
so I need me to focus my work out on my
glute so I first start out with this
mood
kinda like a done Pickwick keep your
legs straight
and I just bring my leg up and down and
they never touch the floor if my concern
basis is time I really squeeze my bobbin
and my glue and I controlled movement up
and down not swinging my leg I'm
controlling it and then I do about 25
each leg and I do three reps
I handle into fire hydrants and again
please
engaging the glutes and cleaning them
together controlling amusements for me
my leg you want to try to keep your back
flat and your core engaged as well I do
about 15 each side and I do that three
times
I then go into donkey kick and I do
usually about 15 each leg three times
but at this point my working is pretty
tired so I only actually could use ten
and again please move keeping them
engaged keeping your back as straight as
possible and engaging your core my core
is a very engaged here but through your
back after I'm done donkey kicks I went
into doing Superman looks like a
variation I didn't bring my upper back
and arms up I just was doing my week and
I did ten of these and this is how use
exercise I do one exercise and then I do
another exercise and then I rest so it's
kind of like an interval and I find such
as like the character go faster but I
just keep my heart rate up and I like to
do this to AB workouts you like all kind
of a good workout and not worth it and
then I kind of put it all together
and then went into medicine ball have
another cymbalta baseball league ball
clause if you don't have a big well just
throw your arms over your head and
engage the core just same I did 10 so I
did 12 squat three times and then in
between the slot set I did kick like a
roundhouse kick which works the side of
your glutes and your hamstrings I did 30
of those each leg
now I'm doing you like step up sings
with a back kick if you don't have this
equipment you can always just like step
up on to a bunch or like a stool or
ledge or anything like that so I'm just
stepping up and picking out my back leg
I did 12 each leg three times
same old and just remember to keep the
glutes engaged and everything squeezing
together
so I'm doing a PA lot I actually in the
pregnancy to a plie pulse right leg just
one feel falls into the swamp
but basically you turn your feet out and
push forward using your flowing and I
did ten of those
so here's where I did see it all so you
get the same position speed out and then
instead of coming all the way up and
going down you just spit in the middle
and hold you can add this to the end to
get an extra work that I felt like - OH
and then I rest in the cenotes
last exercise I did for glute is just
like a hip thrust so just put my lower
back on to the ledge and then I dropped
my bun I always keep on my field to fire
up the flute and I just thrust up you
can also add weight if you want I
usually add a weight to it when among in
stochastic gyms but yeah really engaged
in those and push them fire them up and
keeping on your field will help you use
your glue from set up slice your squad
after this live workout I did abs but
that will be in another video but after
this work that I felt good I felt tired
and I felt like active at a pretty
decent workout for not having anyway so
