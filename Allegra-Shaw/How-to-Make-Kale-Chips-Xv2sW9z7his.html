cookie sheet or whatever and then you
want to get your kale out so I just get
the I don't know normal kale I don't get
biggie though I feel like baby kale
burns more quickly so kind of Jeff so
what I'll do is they let me just rip it
off this is the easiest recipe and I
just spread it out and at the same time
you want your oven to be preheating at
either like three like 3:30 is usually
around the temperature of I do i I kind
of switch it up every time but 3:30 and
I like my pieces to be pretty big
because I feel like if they're not they
shrink and they get really gross so I
was like pretty decent size
and then I just take an extra virgin
olive oil make drizzle it
over the kale then what I do is I take
my hands and they kind of massage it
into the kale it's not evenly spread and
then you want to make sure they're
spread it again now this is the fun part
so normally I put Parmesan cheese and
they're just great Parmesan cheese over
the whole thing but I am on currently on
this elimination diet where I cannot
have cheese so what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna just take some salt this is the
Himalayan pink salt I think it's real
cost oh yeah
Kirkland it's real Costco I'm gonna do a
light dressing over and then this is
when you put your parmesan on if you can
eat dairy or you don't like parmesan you
can put other cheeses on but I can have
cheese so I'm gonna put a a seasoned
salt so this is the seasoned salt that
I'm gonna be putting on and I'm just
gonna sprinkle it over just to give the
chips a little more flavor
so you're gonna put these in the oven
for about 10 to 12 minutes depending
your oven I guess they usually put a net
10 and then I check them right ages with
member 12 but I check them out 10 see
things those extra two minutes here are
the kale chips there you have this
delicious kale chip recipe take and just
take them off with my fingers and if
it's them into a bowl</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
