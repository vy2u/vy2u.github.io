that's kind of different but I just feel
like it's it'll like help a lot of
people and the weather is changing
it's November so we're getting to those
winter months and it's getting colder
and it's getting darker and I feel like
if you're in school it's exam time so
get easy to get into this like funk or
this riot just this place where you just
don't feel great I struggled and I know
a lot of people struggle with emotions
and dealing with things and especially
in wintertime things can get a little
sad so I'm gonna give you ten ways to
get out of your funk you're right get
you back to feeling yourself because
like I know it can be hard and I feel
like a very experienced in this category
so my number one tip is go to the gym or
workout or get some exercise this is the
best natural way to heighten your
spirits and create endorphins and just
start getting over and another thing is
like getting out of it'll give you
something to do it'll get you out of the
house so if you're kind of like you find
no reason to get out of the house going
to the gym ah can be a really good way
to help you lift your spirits and get
you up and you're doing something that's
for you good for your body good for your
health
if you don't feel comfortable going to
the gym um or you feel like you don't
really know what you're doing it's okay
like you can get on a treadmill like
you're if you're gonna I mean I always
just say just go and just do it no one's
judging you everyone's focused on their
own workout um like no one's looking at
you is to go on a treadmill go on a bike
go on something that's easy and then you
can kind of watch people and see what
they're doing that's what I used to do
when I first started going to the gym I
just go on the treadmill or the old tool
or the bike or whatever and that kind of
watch what people do kind of gained
confidence and then now I feel like I
can workout with all the men and not
care
number two is to express what you're
feeling but whether that be writing it
down um I for years and years and years
had a journal and just wrote down how I
was feeling um you could vlog it video
log it um I feel like that's a great wig
and you can just kind of talk it's like
kind of talking to yourself almost and
then you don't have to have to show it
to anyone obviously it's for yourself
but you can just that it's just coming
out of you you like suppress your
feelings and suppress your emotions as
long as you're getting them out as long
as you're expressing how you're feeling
and you're not keeping it inside I think
it's very healthy number three is to go
outside and get fresh air going for a
walk is so great for you you're with
nature you're experiencing you know
outside you're getting fresh air you're
not in your house in your sweats go
outside go for a walk experience nature
number four is kind of a more difficult
one but meditation I found a lot of um I
don't really know the word but I found a
lot in meditation and I used to meditate
every morning it's starting to meditate
there's a great app called headspace
that gives you sort of guided guided
meditation and can help you out if
you're a beginner but meditating really
relaxes your mind calms your mind and
helps you kind of process things there's
just like there's so many benefits to
meditation and I've definitely found
that it worked for me number five is
challenge your negative thinking it can
be difficult for sure negative thinking
negative thoughts always take over and
kind of like a you start obsessing and
they start eating away at all your
positive thoughts but challenge yet so
when a negative thought comes in your
head
why am I thinking like this um think of
a positive thought to challenge that
negative thoughts try to stay positive
being positive is not natural for
everyone I am NOT an optimistic person I
am NOT a positive positive person
um but you have to work at it you really
do challenge your mind think about those
positive things in your life and that
were very how much help you when you
wake up in the morning think of three
positive things in your life will
honestly help you exponentially number
six is do something for others I feel
like a lot of the time especially in
this day and age we're always focused on
ourselves and what we're doing and then
that can lead to a lot of negative
thoughts because you're always thinking
like well how can I achieve better help
how can I be better wise are things
going the way that I want them to go I'm
I miss I'm not but when you start
thinking about other people and you
start helping other people it takes your
mind off of you and puts it on doing
good for other people or other things
number seven is talk to a friend a
parent a guardian or a therapist I have
done all of those things and it can
really help you to just talk talk it out
with a friend maybe they'll be like hey
I have felt like that too don't worry
you're not alone a parent just so people
know what's going on or if you feel like
you know it actually is serious a
therapist um I I know a lot of
universities have free counseling and
use those services I use mine at my
school and they were amazing and it's
great to get a professionals opinion and
have them kind of give you the okay that
what you're feeling is okay and then
help you work through it but give you
tons of tips on how to work through it
as well
I know rate is take a class again this
is about getting out of the house
learning something new doing something
that will take your mind off things so
taking a class you've always wanted to I
don't know eight go to one of those
paint nights if you love to read join a
book club self involved meeting people
and the house my number nine tip is read
and get off social media again off
Facebook get off Instagram throw your
phone in airplane mode
and read read a book read a fiction book
read on fiction book do something that
is in social media and that isn't
comparing your life to other lives and
looking at what other people are doing
turn it off take it away and read a my
number 10 tip which is something that my
mother says to me all the time is smile
smiling releases endorphins
it's called faking until you make it if
you don't feel happy it's okay but smile
fake it and eventually like those with
those positive thoughts those endorphins
from smiling will help you get to where
you actually want to be look in the
mirror and smile as Jesus cheesy as it
sounds smile at yourself in the mirror
it'll actually help stand in a power
pose I don't know if anyone's seen this
on TED talks stand in a power pose like
this or like this superhero pose it was
also degrees out in the episode of
haven't seen that but Amy Cuddy did
research on this power pose smile in the
mirror give yourself that like
confidence you feel confident you feel
happy smile for eating just 5 min 5
minutes is a long time to start yourself
1 minute whatever it will help you so
with that all being said I hope you guys
found these tips helpful for getting out
of you know that rut that funk I hope
everyone is doing well in school
I know exams are coming up so good luck
on those until next time I love you all
