routine I'm just going to kind of
explain my workout situation so
basically I work out at a gym usually
but this some days that I'm pretty lazy
and lately that's been quite often I
actually work out really far from my
house so in the middle of changing gym
memberships somewhere closer to where I
live as I've been working out my gym my
apartment gym quite often and the gym
sucks like it's the worst room in the
world they have no weight they barely
have machines like it's a joke so what
I'm going to do today is I'm going to
show you like a workout routine that you
could do in your home you do when you're
traveling you could do like in your
apartment gym or anything like that and
then I will also film a a like inside
the gym workout routine when I switch
gyms because this the judge that I'm
going to a 24 hours so I'll be able to
film without people being there don't
like to in I think it's going for hours
I just had the same intro as my last
video this video is going to be my ab
workout you can do abs anywhere anytime
you really don't need resistance or
weights to do abs so this is my ab
workout and if you want to see my home
leg workout link in description in the
cards wherever it is my abs are inspired
from previous workouts where I struggled
through this whole thing and I'm just
showing you few of my favorite ab
exercises so this is like I pretty sure
it's called a bicycle so you touch your
opposite elbow to your opposite knee and
then you extend your other arm the
extension of the arm is really I think
what adds it makes it really hard so I
recommend doing that so I do a set of
2210 each side and then I do just a
normal is in a normal crunch
my legs are elevated to a 90 degree
angle and I do a crunch engaging my core
and really pulling up with my core and
then I alternate between two
movement so these are the two I usually
incorporate my ab moves into my other
workouts so I'll do like a squat and
then I'll do an ab exercise and I'll do
another squat exercise sort of thing I
just I like doing ABS that way I don't
like doing them as a set at the end but
so the purpose of this video I want to
show you at all in one another favorite
of my ab exercises is leg Throwdown you
can get someone to actually throw your
legs down if you want makes it harder
but I just my ego my hands to the side
and I throw my legs down my left my abs
were hurting or you can put your arms
behind your head which makes it way
harder so just depends on the day I
couldn't even do this today my absurd so
much for my last workout another one of
my favorite ab workouts is this one you
should take like a yoga block not a
water bottle or you can keep a job 5
pound or 1 pound weight and I'm
struggling so you just hold it with your
knee in your elbow
and then you take your leg and you pump
your legs and you do it both sides so I
would typically do like 12 to 20 but
today it just wasn't working for me I
thought I was gonna die this is a good
one you do need equipment for this one
but there are variations that you can
look up online towards your obliques so
I just I like this machine just get on
it and like a side crunch sort of thing
you can do similar to on the ground
I should have showed you a variation
whatever next time and I just crunch up
and I'll do around 12 each side three
sets those are usually the moves I
incorporating my work go because my
workout works ABS as well like my life
workouts but that's all I do is my
favourite and you okay so that was my ab
workout I hope you guys enjoyed it got
some inspiration on you know new
workouts that maybe have us all better
tried and saw how I worked out I
actually worked out in this video it
wasn't like a like a filming day like I
actually watch the gym
they might please follow me on Instagram
Twitter all that good stuff I really
appreciate it if you did dies and yeah
see you peace mom</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
