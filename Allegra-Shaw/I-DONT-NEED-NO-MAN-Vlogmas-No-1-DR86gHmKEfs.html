with the hit gym this year it was a big
decision because it is a lot of work but
I am going to do it I'm gonna do every
other day I did like every week and I
did every three days and then now I'm
doing every other day maybe next year
I'll do every day I'm on my iPhone right
now I will be filming on my big camera
as well but this was just very
convenient ill switch off between the
two very excited
it's 10:30 I'm just good to make
breakfast I had a late start been
feeling very well
now I should perform video for you guys
today
but as you can maybe see behind me my
apartment is a disaster so what I'm
thinking is I'm gonna clean go for lunch
go maybe for a workout I'm feeling it um
then come back and film a video just
gonna be dark out but I kinda like that
sultry dark light I'm just trying myself
feel better about filming later but
that's the plan today just picked up
packages they were just like press
samples I haven't even looked at them
yet and that's took a while you got my
new okay this is really I got my new
headlights because mine are burnt out
and as you see pax is back there so
we'll open those on camera later
nice to see you I just replaced my
headlights and now they work strong
impending woman didn't know mean no man

background I am just cleaning my sheets

hmm very clean refresh my life up so
came with a body butter a scrum a shower
gel a hands cream and the body mess very
nice love that so this enough I'm gonna
match it's so hard because I always get
things in the mail and then I just want
to keep them I don't want to give them
away but they'll be really nice gift but
I'm going to keep them next one is from
nest who never even heard of mess before
oh my God look at that packaging oh yeah

box I love that and then it smells like
my favorite scent of candle so

um just smoothly Christmas
it's a halt its descent holiday actually
while we're talking about candles so
this candle is my favorite candle look
how disgusting this looks its from
indigo or like chapters or whatever and
it's the chestnut candle I broke the
outside of it and thought like I'll just
put it on a plate yeah obviously not a
good idea very great it's like 30 bucks
that's why I didn't wanna body shop

to get little small Christmas that's for
like Secret Santa and stuff old projects

an amazing company and then I can't this

stocking stuffer it came with a little
lip balm and all you better so this is a
bunch of candles but I got the holiday

of vanilla and amber very nice and it
seems like you can get these at Sephora

December that's amazing those the candle
smells really good I don't know how much

but the packaging is really nice I
totally forgot to show you something

on it it's from a red bubble and I got
myself are you kidding
