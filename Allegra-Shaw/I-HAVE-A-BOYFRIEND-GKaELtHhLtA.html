gonna saw secure it because a lot of you
said callosum wasn't really cohesive so
I hope this is the best way to make a
monthly vlog cohesive and at the end I'm
going to kind of go into a little Q&amp;amp;A
about my relationship and about the new
YouTube changes so also try to fill in
my eyebrows today and I don't know what
I was thinking okay so the first clip is
just an award day this is so classic me
I was like today I'm going to vlog and
like show you what it is going onto my
shirt I'm gonna vlog and like show you
what I do in a day like normally for my
you know for uncle and stuff and then I
forgot my camera at home so annoying so
today you're gonna have to get the
iPhone camera and bear story I should
guess what's going on guys I should
definitely pick up a vlog camera soon I
say that every single time I vlog but

accountant and then I have to go pick up
some vintage denim because we really
dropped more denim and we're actually
going with a new denim to gone by the
time this video is up there'll be a new
denim design out which is sweet I think
I think they'll be out but that will be
cool so yeah
I just dropped off the product as the
embroiderers and printers I can't blog
in there obviously because like if you
just can't really log in locations like
that enamel no aq he counted on the 407

and then we both are in the clothing
industry so we're coming back from many
factors together and how does like oh we
should see the cherry blossoms because
in Toronto cherry blossoms bloom for
about a week so we kind of have to
really see them if you want to see them

kind of like you what are you doing

smile
okay that's all the clips that I got
from this month this month really
consisted of working a lot a lot of
stuff so now I'm going to go into a
small QA event my relationship and all
the good stuff so this is the first time
that I'm actually like talking about a
boyfriend on my channel and if you
remember from dis summer I said that I'm
not going to introduce anyone to my
channel unless it's serious I just like
kind of ended up being someone kind of
ended and I thought I wasn't going to
introduce anyone onto my channel unless
we were serious I am known I know that
transition from December to now might
seem very quick for some people I mean I
wasn't dating that guy that in the
summer it's partially but I have known
Joey for four years we went to school
together we have had previous we have
history together it's not just like a
freshman thing so going into
relationships we kind of both knew that
if we were actually going to be together
it was going to be serious so I'm gonna
have no problem introducing you guys to
him on my channel I'm not sure when or
if he'll ever actually wants it down the
video with me but I thought I should
share with you kind of what we started
dating about two months ago like fully
fully dating he asked me to be his
girlfriend but we do have previous
mystery I have known for a really long
time we've been good friends for a very
long time you seen him on my channel
before like probably 10 times went to
New York last year together he was in
from my blog Smith because we have been
such good friends for such a long time
so you definitely seen on my channel
before if you are a longtime subscriber
yeah so now we're dating and I'm sure he
will be in more videos all that stuff if
you
want to see anything about him let me
know or give any questions I'm happy to
feel more like a relationship Q&amp;amp;A or
anything like that having a few
relationships and motive
in other news if you are an a baby
YouTube goer and you watch a lot of each
videos I'm sure you've seen a lot of
videos what people are talking about
YouTube is changing and it totally is my
views are down my everything is down and
it's a little terrifying so I am NOT a
daily vlogger and not kind of what
YouTube is giving the favors to or like
they're pushing out people's videos who
are daily vloggers and a lot of the
algorithm has changed and you're putting
up content every day they kind of favor
you and I don't do that so I'm kind of
in push to the sidelines right now um so
I'm not going to filming videos I love
making videos I love interacting with
you guys and all that good stuff but I
do I'm still going to you know try to
put up two videos a week I want my
videos to be really quick quality videos
so if I only would have one video a week
if you couldn't get together like a
really good quality video twice a week
so one in two videos a week I'm going to
try to all be asleep it up two videos a
week but does anyone not just me if you
want to help youtubers that you really
like and yeah like I do that paid for
YouTube this is my full-time job and it
doesn't pay a lot like I'm going to be
honest with you what I make off YouTube
ad revenue isn't how I live like I like
to be able to pay my rent with my
YouTube ad revenue so that's like what
that money goes to so if you want to
help any of your fellow youtubers liking
their videos really helps a lot
commenting on their videos really helps
a lot
sharing videos and stuff like and be
engagement really helps so I really do
appreciate if you like always do is give
it a thumbs up right like it takes no
time or a thumbs down I think that helps
to like as long as there's some
engagement I'm happy and that will help
kind of YouTube the algorithm to like
put me into it because it is kind of
like a
every time when your views are down so
much like way more than they are been
and I you know I do need if I want to
make quality content for you guys I need
to we'll do this full-time so yeah um
I'm not complaining I'm just kind of
like helping helping you guys help me
sort of thing we kept each other and
then because it's been very stressful
for me I've had you know this must have
been very stressful with people all
these changes and seeing all these big
youtubers leave and want to leave and
all this stuff has kind of been like a
stressful time for me another thing that
really helped like because all these
changes are happening on YouTube I
really need to like put my eggs in other
basket so I've been posting a lot of my
blog and I'm really going to get into
blogging and posting outfit photos on my
blog and all of that so you can actually
sign up for email on my blog now so I'm
not going to spam you because I hate
emails it may be like once a month
they're like once every two weeks maybe
I'll I don't know email you guys with
the newest blog posts and maybe the
latest videos maybe the latest Instagram
so you kind of get like an emails like
what's happening so if you guys want on
your spot you head over to my blog it's
WWWE sitcom if you could follow me on
instagram that would be amazing
again I'm just trying to like kind of
make all my numbers even so that I don't
feel so just in case anything happens to
YouTube or whatever I don't know what's
happening so it's kind of again scary
and if you did like my Facebook page
I've actually never I never really
promoted Facebook page but there are
some big things happening with Facebook
so I think in the future so if you could
like my Facebook page I think that would
be really beneficial I started off your
posting like shorter videos to my
Facebook page to drive you to my youtube
channel but I could eventually Angeles
posting video straight to Facebook so
Facebook is Allegra Louise to easy good
to go on over and check that out
that'd be great again just a like it
takes no time I don't spam your Facebook
feed or anything like that I post like
when I put videos
about sometimes almost like really cool
business articles for like really funny
memes and stuff like I kind of post that
stuff except I want to say what the
YouTube changes thank you for listening
if you have made so far thank you I
really appreciate it and I think just
helping the YouTube community because
honestly what drives you what makes the
YouTube community is you guys are
watching and viewing and I also have a
viewer like I watch YouTube all the time
so I definitely know that everyone's
kind of struggling and yeah thank you
guys so much for watching I hope you
enjoyed this small little monthly vlog I
am heading to leave so I'll have some
Italy outfits most buses that way should
follow me on Instagram because I will be
into storing my whole Italy trip I'll be
