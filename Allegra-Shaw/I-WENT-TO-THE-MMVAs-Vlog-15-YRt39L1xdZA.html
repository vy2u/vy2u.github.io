wow that was a new intro it's it so this
weekend was epic I've logged but when I
looked at my blogs as one whole item
they were very random so I thought I'd
do different on my blog where I'm like
walk you through what the clips are
about so that it's not just like clip
clip clip good ok so starting off the
weekend on Friday I got up early packed
went up to the front River what's up
everyone
I am vlogging this weekend because it is
my cousin's wedding and is the MMVAs so
it is gonna be a cool weekend to vlog
I'm just getting in the car now and I am
heading up north to the front River I
don't know if you know where that is but
that's where my cousin's getting married
so get ready for an exciting weekend
oh my god I'm going crazy just reserved
in the car for approximately three hours
and I have an hour left and I'm just
dying you know just born Mike my music
it was the same over and over
I thought maybe because in Geylang it's
great but it's just like I get very sick
of it when I've listened the same song
on OC six times
so
a short drive as fast as possible so we
can get there as fast as possible and
link me there it's 1 o'clock right now I
have an hour and - 12 minutes to go but
I have to be there by 2:00 because
okay so it's now 156 so I have five
minutes to get there and I'm so lost my
GPS stopped working and and like there's
no service apik holy in the roads
are so bad so it may just be lost
forever my cousin has a cottage in the
French River so that's why she got
married up there but they did on a lodge
which is close to her cottage section
five hours away and then a boat rides
like five and a half hours but the lodge
was just four hours away still a long
drive do by yourself and you can see I
kind of went a little bit crazy at the
end bought there and it was beautiful
the lodge
we're doing - a raucous forgetting day
drunk with the fam so the first day we
just like hung out the fam'ly as I said
and we just like drinks had bonfire I
did the wedding rehearsal and did all
that fun stuff that you do at weddings

adorable
