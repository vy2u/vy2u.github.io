just like an update of what I've been
doing um well I'm at university this is
my room I'll do like a room tour once I
get everything organized because a
little soil messy I've been really busy
I know I didn't get to film that like
what to bring in a volunteer trip
because like once I got back from Kenya
I was like put into like packing him I
had to go right to university but okay
but um I think I'm gonna try to film out
when I get home in October so that'll be
good
I'm in a double room but my roommate
hasn't showed up yet which is kind of
cool let's go that like a double ruin
myself right now
uh what's awesome I got my first class
today which was awesome my professor
seems really cool yeah okay so I guess I
missed the whole like back to school
things I know a lot of you go back to
school in like August so I kind of
missed that whole thing to do like hair
tutorials stuff because I'm pretty sure
you're like a month into school already
maybe I can do just like fall fall
outfits and stuff if you have any like
video requests or ever just messaged me
or like comment below commenting below
might be easier um what else has been
going on yeah I've just been like trying
to meet new people I think that's like
the hardest part of university is just
like not really knowing anyone I have
three really good guy friends but they
live like not far but like the other
side of campus um but just like meeting
new girlfriends and like trying to you
know find your good friends I think
that's probably the hardest part but I
think that once like school picks up and
I'm actually in class um it'll be easier
to like meet tons of people my first
class today had like 400 people in it
yeah it's crazy it's so different from
high school but it's awesome I'm gonna
do what's to come
I want to do like a room tour when I get
my room like completely set up and I
want to do a makeup collection thing
like how I keep my makeup at you which I
didn't bring all my makeup because I
didn't think I'd wear at all
but I yeah I'll just like show you maybe
I'll do yeah it might be my room tour it
might be a separate video not really
sure my nails are painted black if you
want to know it's black shellac actually
it's really cool
I'm proud of them for like a week
already and it's like hasn't shipped or
anything it's like pristine love it I
love shellac my first time getting four
color shellac I like it a lot um
oh my suit I wore my first day to school
it's been like cold and rainy for the
last like week and today is my first
class and it's like super hot so
whatever I just wore like this tank top
it's really like casual class right it's
just tank top from H&amp;amp;M it's just like a
pink and then I wore my favourite H&amp;amp;M
cardigan and I wore these like
high-waisted shorts like this
you were my toms that are really dirty
and really disgusting but I loved them
when I wore this bag I had like a binder
for like whatever and then my makeup was
just like really simple
um but yeah let's talk about Kenya okay
Kenya was freaking awesome
I can't even Lee put into words like
what it like what it was doing mean like
it was just awesome I was like a month
and it was volunteering and hard work
and meeting awesome people
it was is pretty is pretty amazing so I
think I'll talk about it more when I do
that video which is gonna be probably in
October
yeah wait for that and if you like I
think it'll really help cuz like I
brought a lot of things that I didn't
need and I brought a lot of thing or I
didn't bring a lot of things that I
would have needed so I think that having
that video up if you're gonna do a trip
like that
will be better you know you're just
going to Kenya you know what I mean like
it'll be a good video
um that's basic my life right now
today's Friday so
the weekend and my like serious classes
start on Monday uh so yeah that's
basically what's going on I've missed
you guys I cannot wait to start new
videos I know it's been a long time but
yeah I hope everyone's had a great
couple weeks back at school and school
is not too tough I hope that you're all
having a great time you had a good
summer yeah I will see you guys soon and
thanks for staying with me when I was
gone okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
