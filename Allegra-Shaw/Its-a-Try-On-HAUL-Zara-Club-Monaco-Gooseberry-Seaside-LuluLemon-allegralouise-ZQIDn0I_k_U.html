stunning packaging makes me want to
change the uncle packaging it's just so
fun and then obviously he didn't come
looking like that but I got this mint
green swimsuit um to one piece I don't
know how it fits I actually haven't
tried this on yet so the first time I
tried it on the leave of this video so
hopefully it looks good and I got a
small
it kind of looks really small but I
couldn't find anything online like
people talking about the size that they
got and stuff so those really actions
like hard so I've a small my
measurements are 32 B / P depending on
the bra I have like a 24 25 waist I have
like a 33 34 hip and I'm plastics so a
small but we'll see if it fit
it looks very tiny and I got that
because I'm hosting one of Morocco in
May but we like go somewhere else now
yeah that's right awesome
the next thing we're kind of among we're
off the trip as well I bought these
saludos sandal they will click this and
I actually like I don't own sandals I
don't know if you've noticed but like I
don't wear sandals ever but you know I
thought it was kind of scary
and I really like these ones the brown I
hope they really really pretty in the
summer kind of chic it I mean China a
lotta size 8 and because they they're
gonna stretch out a bit for sure and
they were pretty cheap I got them on
Amazon because they weren't available on
the Oxford slew of site anymore but I
got on Amazon and they were like 50
bucks maybe you'd be bit under and yeah
I'm pretty excited to wear those I don't
know probably not going to be long you
get it and I got a smooth room sincerely
Jules actually thank God I actually got
it as a gift I got just this both beige
and t-shirt and it asked me studios and
just like a really pretty plain t-shirt
go through everything it's really nice
next I will show you Dora so this shirt
I got from Zara it's actually a bodysuit
I got an extra small I should have
gotten this long not sure what I was
thinking but it it looks good buttoned
up it actually looks really going to be
undo this button and you wear a bra let
don't worry about have a meeting so I
have to cover up the booby area yeah
it's nice floral it would look I'm
wearing it with mom jeans right now and
if I had a Gucci belt that would look
really good
the next thing I don't know what it is
about floral I don't know but oh this I
don't know how much this some sure was
by the way obviously as usual everything
will be linked down below
and I obviously want to give a
disclaimer because I've seen some
comments stupid comments lately not on
my channel emotional channels usually
when I post leaves down below they are
affiliate links which means if you
purchase that item through my link I get
some money for it not a lot like
literally a couple cents or like a
dollar maximum maximum five dollars but
it helps me like live and make youtube
videos for you guys obviously for a job
which can be very which can be very
unsteady so having that really helps me
so obviously if I show you something
you're like hey she showed me that I
like it
please buy through my link because
getting that couple dollars you know
pays my Hydra Bell you know one month so
yeah
that being said Zara doesn't have
affiliate links so anytime I need I post
anything whose are I'm not going to
actually on top affiliate links but I
got this kimono if you follow my
Instagram you saw this kimono already
but it's floral it's long it's so cool
how these velvet please oh I'm stuffed
I just love it I love kimonos and it's
like sick like it's gonna be really good
for spring because it's like not warm
but it's like sick it's not like a
flimsy kimono I love that but you can
check that out on my Instagram actually
it's a Toronto icon then the next two
three things or vintage I want just
applaud this like a flop shirt for five
brother I don't know what that is but
the best place to get a plaid shirt are
vintage drawers there so Cheetos like
under $10 and if you also saw my
Instagram you know
devastated I am and you know the hunt to
find the best perfect fitting Levi's
jeans is like an ongoing struggle and I
found a pair they are the perfect wash
they fit me perfectly and then I ripped
the ass
like not even a little bit I ripped the
pull off and she told me on social media
you'll know that this is my third pair
of pants that I've earthy ass and they
were all my favorites my Allstate's one
of my citizens and you use they were $20
so yeah I'm going to try to find this
style and model again and find the one
line because they fit perfectly of
events that rip but there was already
like a tiny tiny bit rip and then I like
want to sit down and it just ripped very
upsetting so those are vintage and my
vintage troll that I go to a lot in
Toronto I go to have to pinch age I go
to block market hold it butter all those
places and I didn't have a war net but
kind of soft twist just read guest
jacket it's like a vintage guest jacket
and it has few patches on it that it's
like a running like a racecar jacket 20
bucks no really like it I bought a dress
from booboo I don't like who's going out
of business or something and everything
is super cheap like really inexpensive I
have this dress in black and I also have
it in red and I started to meet color
it's like a super flattering fit for me
house like triangle boobs going to click
a midi dress and it's just really
form-fitting just really really
flattering for my bust area and also
wear bra um it's just nice color that
and I was reeling since like 3 bucks
maybe
lastly Club Monaco I bought this stuff a
pretty long time ago but I litter
moving in this bag to show you with this
in the hall but I have worn these pants
these are in Instagram as well and a
blog post
they're just Club Monaco suit pants and
it's like pink purple beige color I'm
stuffed with the super nice easy to wear
so where it's like anything dress up
dress down and they're just a suit pants
and you can't go wrong with the suit
pants and everything that I got from
Clamato is on sale from the sale and
then I got an extra so I felt like I
spend a lot of money but like for the
pieces I got it wasn't a lot of money
and then very not me this dress but it
was so flattering when I put it on I
just realized it's floral again I don't
know is this weird look floral thing and
so weird so not me
but it was so flattering on like I could
wear bra with it it just looked so good
so I was like okay I could like belt
this I swear leather jacket with this I
could make it like funky so it's not
like girly but it's just this nice like
floral MIDI link slip and I felt like I
had a wedding or something or even just
like an outdoor thing in the summer with
a leather jacket it would look really
nice and it was 200 and then it was like
30% off that and then like 20% off five
or something and I got a double zero in
this but it was just so flattering I
couldn't I couldn't say no because it
was so flattering
oh and acne shirt I got is just extra
small all everything like down below I
tell you her wallet I have been looking
for my wallet for week oh my god oh
happy day honestly and then the next
thing I got again really not me and not
what I'm used to but it was just I saw
some Danny or Dawn a song that bloggers
wearing something very similar to this
Fashion Week and it looked looked that
off so I was like it I can do it but
it's a little bit big for me so I have
to get taken in and it was on like hella
hella hella sale
so this white long-sleeve it looks like
wedding dress white long-sleeve like
embroidered dress with this felt here
and then it's like short crewneck and
what i thought i could do with it is
wear a big chunky spiked belt and black
heels with this and i think it would
make it more me and not so girly wedding
but it was on Hollis a line like I love
it Oh totally brought about this stuff
okay I often workout stuff because I
work everyday and the last time I bought
workout stuff was maybe two years ago so
the first thing I'd already shoes
they're just Reebok they were like 80
bucks and I hate them so I don't
recommend them but that's one show them
to you I only need them I stared too big
for me anything I got them in a nine so
I need a half but that's been a in half
and they just what too big for me so
they were really uncomfortable but I
think if I got them the right size and
it was like them and I also thought that
this wasn't like neon I thought it was
exceeded on the website it looks faded
so and then I went to Lululemon and I
picked up some workout pants but what I
really needed and I bought these I don't
know what they're called threw it off
the tag but they're like the naked pimp
and oh my god these are amazing to work
out and I was very skeptical these are
like it doesn't really ring camp and
looks like amazing
so those blue colors didn't really have
anything else I'm for Lululemon and oh
my god they're just like the most
comfortable workout pants I'm going to
get them in black I'm going to get them
other colors they have crop needs to the
pants but oh
this material is just stunning and it's
I think you're $88 I'm going to another
pair of pants are a little more
expensive but they have more features to
them there again and it's holding less
the colors my wall a little obsessed
with this color as you can see
I think blue is my favorite color but
they are a cropped pants like a 7 8 pant
and blue color they have a waist and
what I really like with them is they
have these side pockets and I think this
is just like where are they where's the
pocket and he's inside out
oh yeah they're inside out and they have
these pockets on the side here buddy can
I put your phone or whatever and I just
really really love them I think you were
more something like over 100 but again
what workout clothes in really long time
so those would you fancy are from
Lululemon and since those shoes suck I
got some IV rush runs I don't want to
spend like a ton of money I tried all me
ideas ultra boost new running shoes
they're like 250
they're like $250 and I didn't want to
spend on shoes I don't find I need like
I don't run really so I just didn't
think I needed too much money so I
bought the Nike Roche runs they were $99
Coffman white a pound of hair have your
black ones and I literally don't know
where they were when I moved from my
parents house to here they got lost and
I don't know where they are because I
wouldn't have bought these how'd I sound
the other ones but I'm looking for ever
and I can find them there are $9 worked
out in them and I really like them I do
really love the Nike fries and I don't
think I I think those were always my
favorite shoes but you couldn't find
them or like coming I liked so these are
good for not kind of us so those we got
me through like another year Cheers so
