January favorites and January is my
birthday month so it was a good month
actually it's more a month but my
birthday was really fun um
back at school kind of slacked off in
January but um so if you favorites that
I want to show you so let's get right
into it so start out with them with
makeup as per usual I don't really
actually have that many makeup favorites
I don't really change up my makeup
routine that much so it's kind of hard
like have makeup favorites every month
but uh um I guess start with foundation
this is the foundation I've been using
so this is the L'Oreal Paris magic nude
liquid powder bare skin perfecting
makeup and honestly it's like you have
to shake it out because it kind of
separates and I just really like the
consistency it's not like super full
coverage but like it covers everything
that I need to cover other with my under
eye circles which I use concealer for
but um it doesn't feel like you're
wearing a lot of makeup and I think
that's what I like the most about it is
it actually doesn't feel like doing this
like heavy coat of meat on your face it
kind of just like goes away and doesn't
actually feel like I'm wearing makeup at
all so I've been applying that with this
brush and for Christmas I got a I think
it's called Eliam DeLeon medallion
brushes and I heard about them off of a
Miss makeup maven my name's Tenny she
has a YouTube channel and she's like
gorgeous unbelievable makeup so I heard
it I thought I was gonna get Sigma
brushes but I like really liked her and
she swears by the dolly
brushes so I got out of 24 set brush 24
piece brush set or whatever so this is
the dumb tools 9:57 and it's just a flat
top kind of like kabuki brush and I just
have been applying these two together
and I've just been loving the finish
that it gives I guess I'll just do the
other brush the other dime tools brush
live and loving is the 785 and it's just
a blending brush for your eyeshadow but
I've just really been liking this one I
just I think it gives like a flawless
finish and it's really easy to get and
the crease that kind of blends
everything out and it's really good for
like really natural makeup looks um and
then my last two makeup products are
this is a Revlon Photoready skin lights
face Luminator this is 100 bare light
and I had never heard about these before
but I just picked them up so that looks
really cool and it's supposed to kind of
give your face the effect of being in
like soft light and I'm pretty sure
there's like high-end companies that
have the same thing there's a company
that has powders I think I don't know
that powders but this is like a like a
liquid clean kind of thing and it
honestly didn't give directions on how
to use it I'm guessing you could
obviously just like dab it on
highlighting areas but I've been kind of
using it as a base so I put it under
only mate like I kind of put on this
primer I can use the primer to so but I
kind of use that as a primer and it
gives my face that overall like glowing
effect and I've been really liking this
makes my face look like I'm in very
light I don't know I don't know it just
makes me feel super nice and the last
product I've actually had this for a
really long time and I'm pretty sure
someone gave it to me like a long time
ago but I just kind of discovered it it
is need Estee Lauder pure color eye
shadow and 38 chocolate lists oh wait no
I lied Estee Lauder pure color eye
shadow so it has 60 sugar biscuit satin
and 38 chocolate list matte in it and
the colors it's kind of dirty
so that's what the colours look like and
it's just a really pretty easy natural
everyday kind of color so I just use lid
and crease and it's just kind of because
I don't I don't really like wearing
eyeshadow everyday but if I need to look
a little more put together I'll just put
these two on and I just it looks really
nice and put together so um I don't know
if you can buy this because someone
dictum it to me I don't I'm pretty sure
you probably can or you get the colors
individually but they're really really
pretty of sauce and there's aren't so
many dupes for these but it is just a
lighter color and then a chocolate but I
have it in little package so it's
perfect
um so that is it for makeup I know not a
lot so what should we move on to next um
skincare I guess yeah I have just been
like dying over
Olay and I know it's not like it's like
drugstore but I I love it and I love the
the scent at all
so first I bought the cream and then I
was like I love this actually I use my
roommate's cream and then I bought it
and so I'll show you the cream it's the
Olay Regenerist microscopy micro
sculpting cream just looks like that
it's just like a cream and it's not a
daytime or nighttime nighttime cream so
I kind of use it both and I have another
cream if like I want lighter but I use
it for both and it smells divine
like it just smells clean and fresh and
everything you want to create a smell
like so I've been really liking this and
then I just got the Olay eye cream
age-defying I know I'm 21 and I'm like
soon as I turn 21 or like I was coming
up to 21 I'm like oh my god I need to
watch it for these wrinkles so don't
really tan anymore like I just don't
want to get wrinkles um so um so I got
the eye cream I got it the matching one
I guess well no age
fine but I cream I really like it I
don't usually use an eye cream so it's
very nice and luxurious to have and then
I bought the Olay Regenerist advanced
anti-aging regenerating cream cleanser
looks like that has little scrubbing
micro exfoliating needs and it's
anti-aging so it smells really good it
doesn't like burn your eyes to get in
your eyes it's really gentle and soft so
it's been loving that summer little ole
a set like obsessed though I know and
another skincare thing that I use with
out routine that's not Olay I was I
heard about it mmm YouTube like a long
time ago and I heard you can only get it
in Europe and whatever but I saw it at
Shoppers Drug Mart and I bought it it's
pretty expensive but it's the Bioderma
what is it since their skin cleanses
Rios make-up suit whatever it's this
Bioderma toner cleanser thing and it is
so soft on your skin like you can wipe
off your makeup doesn't burn your eyes
it's so nice and I only use this much
and I've had it the whole of January and
I just like I love it
I absolutely love it I know why it's
hyped about I broke the cap off because
loser like it comes right off but if you
can find this I really recommend getting
it because it's just like sensitive skin
like takes off your makeup so well last
night I didn't I was didn't really want
to wash my face at night so I just like
put this on cotton pads and like it just
took off all my makeup and it came off
right away it was awesome
so been loving that and then also since
I don't really well I haven't really
been tanning feel lost like a year I
don't really tan anymore or like go to
the tanning booth because it's like so
bad for you
you know what's leaking no gross so
censure PEs
I mean this has talked about so much it
provides so many reviews but you use the
mitt and I just use this one I'm like
special occasions basically I'm fine the
EPL right now I'm pale whatever so I
just use how am I going out I put on my
legs but yeah it's really good it's
really nice there's so many reviews
typed up a lot so I'm not a big perfume
collector um
just haven't been I have maybe like five
at school I have the pink sugar Paris
Hilton
Daisy Ralph Lauren blue one and the
Victoria's Secret gold which I really
like it's like springtime so I picked up
well I think where do I get this I think
so I didn't buy this if someone gave it
to me or they got as a gift and legree
gifted it or something um I can try on
take care remember
what's the Escada cherry in the air and
at first I didn't really like it but
it's a pretty nice sentiment I've been
kind of living kind of trying to work
with it to use it and I actually like
liked it I don't wear it all the time
but I actually do you really like it and
I it's not a smell smelt it on other
people and I like it on other people but
yeah it's pretty cute at the small model
and I have such my protein so I'm not
really stuck to one and then for fashion
favorites um
oh my watch should I go out for
Christmas
Michael I'm sorry Marc Jacobs watch just
a gold watch it's small and if you can
see it's like pretty small and I like
that it's just a nice everyday watch
this necklace which is not even mine

literally every day
it's j.crew and it's like look how
amazing that is it has like these pretty
colors and it looks really good I'll be
so nice in the springtime it's not like
mine like everyone will be able to wear
it different times it's hers but well
Brady it is I wore it like looking at
myself

pretty cool um and then this shirt I
wear all the time it's just like a candy

j.crew and I love it I just always need
like a nice black tank top that's not
like tight and cotton but yeah that's it
