so I'm gonna do my June favorites today
by the way I did films makeup look so it
will be up next week or whenever it goes
up um I'm gonna turn the exposure down
that's better okay so I'm on that many
products but I feel like they're good
products that I want to share with you
guys so I decided to do a June favorites
holy it's July crazy I guess a that
every month oh okay so wait so uh I
guess a little start with products I
actually don't have any um oh yeah okay
so let's just start um so makeup
products I have three the first one is
this covergirl Oh sugar a lip balm I
don't know if I've mentioned this in
papers days before but I just put this
on like every time I do I mean it looks
cuz if y'all know me and you know my
channel not big lipstick person I mean
sometimes I am but usually I like to
just throw on something like this
moisturizing gives like a sheen of color
it's nice with like a lip liner
underneath it's just like it makes me
feel like I've done my makeup but I'm
also like I don't forget it careful with
the lipstick because I have like big
lips sort of I mean I used to have a big
lips but now we're getting lip injection
so I don't have big lips anymore like
Adam you know I don't know I just lay my
lips are big and like I always lick them
so the lipstick comes off and looks
shitty so I like this
my mom just somebody need to go to the
Rogers Cup I don't like tennis but I
like my mom so yeah I really like that
the two other ones are actually lip
products no sorry one-two lip product
ones my products so this is the Too
Faced lip injection extreme instant and
long-term lip plumper there's two of
them
I don't think extremism like I'm gonna
buy when I'm as much get the extreme one
and I got it
again reason why I have big looks like
everyone's getting the projection stars
like I need a little plumpness and
mostly because my top lip is a lot
smaller my bottom lip and I remember
when I first started gaining followers
on Instagram I posted this like selfie
and someone commented your lack of upper
lip makes me want to die
I'm like so I don't know comments always
stuck with me but this is a clear lip
gloss and I put it on and it make sure
lips burn and it is supposedly
supposedly makes them bigger does it
really work I think it works in the
short run for shirts that like makes
your lips puffy um
long-term I don't know but also it says
it's just put it on like morning and
night and like I haven't been doing that
so I don't know I just use it when I
want a little bit of lovelies before or
after I put on some lip products so it's
pretty cool pretty cool idea if you know
any other lip plumpers that you like
down to try them and then this last one
is a tease cosmetics t-squared Max is a
new company and they sent me like this
like little media package and I've been
really liking this because it's sore and
my makeup on I want it to be like like I
would've been tanned I wanted I made did
this makeup but I don't want thick black
liner if I have I shadow on and this is
like a nice alternative sort of it's a
liquid liner but it's like a bronze
liquid liner so I just like put it on
the top and it kind of makes everything
smoky and pretty and bronzy and yeah
just like I'll just swatch it pretty
quickly we'll do it up close - it's just
like a bronze liquid liner and I think
it's really pretty kind of adds to a
look makes it look a little more special
and yeah I've been really digging that
okay that's it for makeup yeah like I
don't really wear me from the summer
I like to just you know be natural as I
have this full glam makeup on right now
the next three things are other things
this is the loving tan to our expressed
electrons emus I'm sure you've heard of
this it's all over YouTube and I just
like it's like it's time for me to try
it tried it I love it the smell is
really good it's kind of like a vanilla
you smell compares like other self
tanners like it's a pretty good smell
and I'm gonna do a self tanner routine
but this has no parabens and no alcohol
in it which is good seems like very are
nice animals also good because there's a
little money on it so I'm thinking
that's good um and yeah I just put this
on usually at night and then shower one
morning and I look bronze as so
that's nice
have this link down below but this is a
really good bronzing mist the next thing
is this keels clearly corrective dark
spot solution you can see I'm like
halfway through the bottle and as you
know like I have dark spots from like
acne scarring on my chin and I've been
using this every day morning and night
to see if it works I think it's worked
like it definitely feels as if they're
not so red which I like and then I have
a nappy scar right here from the zip
that I literally had for three weeks in
December and I feel like it's basically
gone so I think this really does work I
will let you know once I finish the
bottle but yeah I think it's good I've
also been using like other vitamin C
products or seasons sunscreen as well I
hope it's this and I'm not just like tan
so it's all kind of you know blending
together but I think this is working I
should have taken before and after
pictures but I did it the next thing is
a perfume so I have a lot of trouble
finding a perfume that I like I've said
this in
before and everyone gave you
recommendations and Tesla all come out
like I just can't headaches really
easily so from perfumes and stuff so
it's really hard for you to find the
perfumes that I like and originally I
went in to Holt Renfrew or socks like
they have about both to get gypsy waters
I heard about it all over YouTube and
I'm like gypsy walk me right oh my Rhett
oh I don't have to pronounce it but
gypsy water I went I was so excited like
I'm gonna buy this
I go in I smell it I'm like dude I hate
to smell like I hate it so then I
smelled all of them and I landed on
Mojave ghosts and I'm obsessed it smells
so delicious this is the sample
obviously because I wanted to test it
out before I bought it it's not so nice
it does give me headache and I think the
scent that I like in it is sandalwood
because I think that's a common thread
for all
perfumes that I like it's sandalwood so
I love all the Guerette like there's a
look like a whole line in barreto
perfumes and all them smell really good
I just need to find like this is the
store that I can wear on a constant
basis and not give me a headache and not
get sick of it and whatever I'm obsessed
this I have had three samples hosen
house I've been wearing for a while and
I go to purchase the big one it's just
they're very expensive the small one 50
mil is $200 Canadian and the hundred mil
is $300 Canadian so it is a big purchase
and I just need to wait until I can
afford it samples are good for now
though because they're free those are
all the products that I have been loving
so that's product wise and then for like
clothes and stuff this shirt I have like
been obsessed with is just a vintage
Burgers and Fries shirt I wear a dress
and some extra large amounts uh spit
Gladrags my online store if you guys
