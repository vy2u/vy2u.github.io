worker a team this is going to be a
series and let's start with glutes these
are fire hydrants and I usually do
around 30 each leg so this is how they
look and I'll do 30 each leg in a
circuit
moving on to donkey kicks you can either
bring your knee all the way down or do
it how I'm doing I also do these in a
circuit and I usually do around 15 to 20
in the circuit so now I'm going to go
into squats and this is a goblet type
squat where you hold the weight in front
of you instead of using the sport rack
these are awesome because you can do
them when you're traveling or you can
just do them on the floor at the gym you
don't have to like figure out how to use
the equipment so you can drop it lower
than I'm dropping or you don't have to
drop it as low but make sure you're
pushing up with your gluts through your
heels and then the side view you can
kind of see how I thrust my hip forwards
to really get that burn okay this is a
bent leg deadlift with just a dumbbell
or you can do with a kettlebell I
usually use higher weights for all of
these I just is all I had at home but
they're great to remember to push up
through your heels through your glutes
hip bridges are awesome I usually take a
big round weight about Staryu five towns
put it on and push that up remember
always pushing through your face that's
a lot of the moves I use for glutes
remember to subscribe and I'll be
continuing to do workout videos I like
update my routine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
