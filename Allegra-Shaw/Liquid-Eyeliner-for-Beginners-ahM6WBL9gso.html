about eyeliner um just like my favorite
eyeliners and I'm gonna actually show
you how to put on lip eyeliner this was
a request by one my good friends
Danielle what I want to okay
basically there are two options for
eyeliner you have older three but I'm
going to show you two you have this one
which is like a little brush on the end
like that or you have this one which is
like a little foam thing on the end you
can see that um and there also the pen
ones which can come to brush for more
foam form form these are the oolitic
little pot ones um if you are starting
out or if you're just not good at it
like me the foam is so much easier than
the brush the brush is like it takes a
skilled expert to control all the little
bristles and like direct I don't skilled
expert if you can use a brush well good
on you um but definitely start out with
the foam makes it way easier and it's
more controlled and precise so um this
is my favorite one this isn't brown this
is the almay liquid liner and I'm gonna
get this in black because I love it so
much but even the brown is pretty dark
and I like do like this a lot um so yeah
let me show you how to do it so I'm
gonna take my favorite liquid eyeliner
and this isn't Brown I wish I had in
black but I don't is um I'm a liquid
eyeliner so what you want to do the
easiest way to do this have a mirror
blow and you look down to the mirror and
then do it or if you can close one your
eye um that also works I can close this
side I can't close that eye so start in
the middle
and I drag mine up but you can do
whatever you want at the end
and so I'm just gonna kind of make it
like that
so now you have your end which is like
the hardest part and then what you want
to do is just evenly drag it across your
eye and this is this is the part that's
easier
I don't mirror um go around here if you
have you have a mirror below you and
then you like look down into it um I'm
just gonna try to show you as best as I
can
and you can just make it as thin or as
thick as you like I'm just going to pick
a little bit thicker
okay another popular way to do it is to
trace it with um normal liner first and
then go over top with it liquid
I actually just personally like doing
the liquid it makes it easier so once
you have your line and like I usually
like to use all the product and then I
go over it again um with like I dip it
back in then I go over it just to make
it um more clean okay and then what you
want to do it this is I like doing this
is you just take the tip and do your
inner inner corner just drag it you
don't make sure to have a lot of product
or the product will get into your eye
but this stuff is so good because I get
into out like all the time because I'm
so bad at this I don't even know why I'm
taking you guys it but this stuff
doesn't hurt at all getting in your eye
which is sick so just finishing up
and the end result looks like that I'm
going to do this like
know what you just want to do to fill in
anything that you missed is take a black
eyeliner pencil I just like lift my eye
up a little bit and fill in the edges
like underneath and this gives you the
liner look that you want
so like that then you add your mascara
and you are all done and I hope this
helped all of you and I will talk to you
guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
