what I'm gonna do now is take this one
and a half inch so my camera's good I
switch week this past one and a half
inch curling iron and on my left side
I'm gonna curl it under like this and
what I would do is if I wanted to meet
if I want to make the curls stay all day
I would wait till got hot take it out
like this and then pin it pin the curl
up and wait to look cool but I don't
have time for that since I've class soon
so I'm just gonna let it fall but
they're just not gonna stay as long
which is fine with me because I'm just
going class so but I really do recommend
the pinning the curl up and then
hairspray out when it's all cooled off
so you can take big sections if you want
just go like this
okay so just keep doing that on your
right side and I'm gonna trim I care
about not wanting it so now I'm at the
top of my head you can do this middle
part or a side part I'm doing the middle
part but I know we're in a car usually
has a side part but like Candace same
house a middle part and they do it on
both so starting back here I like to
pull it kind of up to give me I like to
start at the root and pull it up to give
me a lot of volume you're gonna get a
lot a lot more volume if you pin the
girls and the girls are actually like
pretty pretty curly from here if you if
you pin them up I'm gonna do a separate
tutorial not when I have a little more
time but I did want to do a finished
look for you guys because I like
watching finished look so I take and a
to take hairspray and just do a light
spray that smells without the unscented
one seriously smells like vodka okay
then on my right side a section and I
flip the curler up so that it's going
the opposite way so like instead of
folding the curl under I have it over if
you know what I mean by that because
this makes the curls flip outward
instead of inward until it's hot see how
the curls are kind of going away for my
face now so again do this all over your
head I'm gonna do
I'm gonna do some of the back parts -
okay so now I'm on my bangs and I'm
going to show you how I do them so I
take the front sections like this I'll
let that one
rush them out and then I take this and I
do them away from my face like this like
this and then I'll take them so that's
just like to smooth them out kind of and
then I'll take them and kind of do the
same thing but like I thought I was
doing the rest of my hair but like a
little faster because it's not as much
hair ah
and then like that I literally do this
hair like every day it's so easy to do
and then are you gonna do this one this
way
whoops like that doesn't might be
tracing your hair this is what I do
every day if you wanted to add more
curls just take one of these little
babies and just curl little pieces so
it's more curly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
