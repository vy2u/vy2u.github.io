we're gonna start off the foundation I'm
gonna use a l'oreal true match
foundation I'm in w-4 I really really
like this stuff so I'm just gonna put a
little bit of a hand I hope this is
recording take whatever a foundation
brush that you use and let's put this
all over face
okay so this is the self-tanner I was
talking about it's my absolute favorite
it's called sun goddess sunless tanning
lotion dark it's literally the best
smelling stuff like it doesn't really
smell like tanning stuff which is
amazing
you do need to wear rubber gloves to put
it on or your hands will be orange for a
long time and it kind of has that green
tint in it that's so like it makes it
brown not orange and I just adore this
I'm going to do a whole video on this
because like this is litter than my
favorite stuff so look out for that and
you've got online but I'll do a whole
video on this I just want to let you
guys know yeah my I'm gonna do the gonna
try my L'Oreal True Match concealer in
w123 Fairlight gonna put make like sorry
I just lost my train of thought make
like a triangle like this to lighten up
the whole area
and then I'm going to put it on any
other spots that I need if you have
perfect skin you don't have to do this
step okay so now I'm just blend it in
I'm gonna blend with a brush so if you
like getting my fingers dirty but you
can Lyndon with your your fingers if you
want and I'm just gonna pot it on just
to get that full coverage effect
I'm going to take this Rimmel stay matte
clean brush and I'm just gonna put it
all over my face to set my foundation
and then I'm gonna do bronzer I'm gonna
use two bronzers I think that for the
pic Fashion Show they used Victoria's
Secret bronzer and goddess but I'm
sneeze what I have I mean I had that
last year I used in my last year's
Israel but so I'm gonna use this Too
Faced bronzer in aqua bunny looks like
that
and I'm just gonna put it where the Sun
would hit my face because this year
they're pretty they're still bronzed as
usual but it's more of a natural look
that they're going for and not so
glammed up which I like because they're
already natural beauties and so are all
of you so like duh
I always start here and then move it up
right in the forehead no to the chin and
damn the neck but they didn't use liquid
liner this year much like thank you
because I'm so bad at the good liner so
it'll be easier and I also found that
they kind of like made the look
different for every girl to suit their
eye shape so always do the makeup
tutorial for your eye shape not for that
guru or makeup artist or models eye
shape because everyone obviously looks
super different and then to set that
bronzer I'm going to use this shimmery
bronzer it's called Sundance by Rimmel
I'm lyric - Ronsard but whatever it's
all I have
so just kind of put the powder over top
of where you put it to get not sunkissed
glow effect we're super pink and super
light which I really like so I'm gonna
mix these two I'm gonna mix these two
blushes I'm gonna mix don't face my
Tarte and Rose doe by Sephora so it look
like this I'm gonna put the third one on
braces gonna use the same brush I'm just
gonna keep it more back up here instead
of like right on my apples and I'm gonna
bring it like forward
they did have pretty rosy cheeks but
everything's also tell more toned up for
them because they're obviously on TV and
stuff but if so so then I was gonna put
this one right over top now we're
basically done the face alright so as I
was saying my camera keeps dying after
you going the film of charge up put the
champagne by the trade secret or
whatever but whatever company you're
using on your eyelid so that's how you
should love it and then I'm gonna take
the crease color from the walking on
eggshells thing right here and take this
little brush like don't brush on about
their common all right oh and I'm just
gonna put this into the crease and kind
of bring it out a little bit and take a
blending brush I'm blending out so it's
not so harsh
and then take some more I'm not blending
blush that brown color kind of drag it
out they kind of extended it past the
lash line I'm just gonna touch up with
the lid color a little bit I'm also just
this ISM the knock on wood by wet and
wild there crease color there really
dark brown I'm just gonna darken it up
just a little bit okay my camera keeps
 dying okay so I just put the
dark color in here and this and this and
then I just put the like the brown the
light brown in this I like you already
saw that so I just did it to this eye so
now I'm going to show you what I
pressing it so I put this dark color on
this brush and I literally just put like
one line like cutting the crease like
this and then another dip and I just put
on the lash line I think this blending
it out upwards and then take my blending
brush then blending it out like them
like so and they should look pretty even
now I'm just gonna take a little bit of
the darker
okay so they're your eyes the eyeshadow
part anyway soft and gentle by Mac this
is like a staple everyone should have us
it's amazing and I'm gonna put this as
my highlight
down out it to the inner corner and then
while we have it just add it to your
cheekbones to get that glow
so you glow like an angel put it down
your nose if you want keep its bow I
think I'm like putting shove it up my
nose because I feel like it makes it
look super long okay and now since they
didn't use liquid liner I'm really
hoping my camera is recording
take a black pencil liner and tightline
pretty seriously tight line your upper
low
you tightline both of your eyes we're
gonna do is take a favorite white
mascara eyeliner and they're a mere
bottom
okay and then they put brown mascara on
the bottom so I took this lash salado
maybelline lash Leto and I put on the
bottom because this is the brow mascara
that I have and then for lips they were
pretty natural so I'm just taking this
Victoria Secret lip gloss and sublime
because I hate wearing lipstick</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
