today's video is about your clothes how
to make them look more expensive how to
keep them in your wardrobe for longer
and how not to ruin them I think you to
dub for sponsoring and collaborating
with me on this video they share my
values in investing in staples so it's
always the plus for me let's just give
me the video so you can learn that tip
number one is to use hair elastics to
help you keep your sleeves rolled up all
you need is two hair elastics or just
normal off sticks you roll up your
sleeves you add the hair elastic to your
sleeve scrunch it around so you can't
see it there you go no more fussing with
please our sleeves are rolling them up
or having them too tight on your arm
tip number two I feel like has been said
and done many times but I wanted to add
it into this one it has to do with handy
liners in camel toes everyone gets cable
toes okay it's just the fact of life
especially in workout gear or leggings
high waisted leggings it happens to the
best of us so all you really need is a
panty liner take it off stick it in our
underwear and it'll kind of make your
underwear a little bit harder and it'll
create like a scoop so you don't get
deep camel toe tip number three is to
prevent antiperspirant stands from your
ruining your clothing I use a dub
invisible dry spray to do this I really
like this one this is the pink cap one
and they really like that's what's most
really nice um but it was tested safe
one hundred colors earth doesn't leave
any white marks like I do is shake it up
really well spray at like 15 centimeters
but it's sprayed a little bit away and
you be good to go
tip number four is for those shedding
sweaters I could actually probably do it
to this one I think this one sheds a bit
but all you got to do is fold up a
sweater put it in a freezer bag and
leave it in your freezer for an allotted
amount of time I would probably do like
half an hour to an hour but
realistically I usually forgot about
that
like three days and they come out like
Oh throughout this winter don't ask me
the science behind this tip I really
don't know or understand it but it does
work tip number five and this is great
if you're staying at a hotel like I am
if you have a wrinkled shirt and no
steamer two things you can do I'm just
realizing the second one you actually
can't do that hotel the first weekend
first one you just run a really hot
shower hang up your items and you can
kind of like pull it down a little bit
but hot really hot shower and the steam
in the bathroom will let go of the
wrinkles in the shirt and the second one
if you're at home or someone has a dryer
all I gotta do is take an ice cube and
stick whatever item it is it's dryer
safe into the dryer with the ice cube
and let it dry and all the wrinkles will
be released tip number six is all about
atom care and you guys know I'm
passionate about denim I have so many
pairs of jeans it's disgusting
one of the tips I can tell you for
darker wash denim and denim that bleeds
is to wash it with vinegar this will
help prevent it from leading and and it
will help it
stop fading the second tip is to not
wash your denim as often so a great way
if your denim is like smelly or dirty
issue again put it in the freezer you
just throw it in a bag or you just put
it straight in the freezer and then
freeze it for a while and then bring it
out and you can scrape off if there's
like any dirt or anything and scrape
that off but it'll get rid of the smell
and it'll be good and fresh for you tip
number seven is about beating students
and these are so expensive Meli it's
crazy and when you're summer season is
as short as ours is in Canada you don't
want to wear when your bathing suits
enough to purchase new ones every year
so what I do is after I'm done with my
bathing suit I always always wash it or
rinse it in water before I wash it so
sometimes I don't get to washing my
bathing suits right away like in the
washing machine so when I come out of
the lake or the pool or the ocean I just
rinse it off and I'll get all the
chlorine or saltwater or lake water out
of your bathing suit and it will prevent
it from like you know it crinkles up or
like the salt makes it fade a lot of
things that outdoor elements can do your
rating
so rinse them and you won't deal with
those issues tip number eight is how to
prevent runs in your tights
I don't wear tights a lot but I know a
lot of people have to do so new pair of
tights you just put them on you grab
some hairspray and then you spray your
legs and it'll help prevent runs which I
feel like is a really great tip this
runs in your tights are just not cute
tip number nine I wasn't gonna ruin a
shrimp boil stains to show you how to do
this chick tip but tip number nine is to
lift oil stains I cooking and get olive
oil or hair oil or whatever you use baby
powder you can mix something maybe
printer has a paste and then put it on
top and you let it sit and it'll lift
the oil I also think you can use dish
soap look that one up
number ten is to take care of your
clothing so you can do this two ways one
is to take your clothes to the dry
cleaner clothes that need to be
dry-cleaned you gotta take them to a dry
cleaner you can't just throw them in the
wash but they will get ruined in the
long run you're gonna save money to not
be ruining your clothes and buying
multiple items find an eco-friendly dry
cleaner try not to use one that uses
very harsh and gross chemicals but there
are out there and can get pretty good
deals or dry cleaning it's not that
expensive but do that and you'll end up
buying less over time and the second
thing same kind of deal we've all you
know purchased the same pair of jeans a
hundred times they can't they didn't fit
exactly how you wanted them to fit take
them to the tailor taking them into
tailor does it cost that much money and
the jeans or whatever item it is it's
gonna fit your body perfectly and
they're gonna look like they're made for
you and then you're not going to end up
buying and wasting garments they'll also
love them more and wear them more
because they'll just be made and they'll
fit your body that's it those are my
tips if you have any tips leave them in
