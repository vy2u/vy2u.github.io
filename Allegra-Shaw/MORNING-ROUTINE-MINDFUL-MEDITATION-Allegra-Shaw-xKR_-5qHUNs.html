bed is brushing my teeth
my next task is always making a coffee I
want to thank Nespresso for
collaborating with me on this video I
love this new machine if you've watched
my previous morning routines my parents
had an espresso machine so when I moved
out I was pretty upset that I couldn't
have an espresso coffee every morning
this machine is the newest sunzha mini
which is perfect for my tiny apartment
I've never owned a coffee machine before
because they were always way too big for
the amount of counter space that I have
here I really appreciate the size and
compactness of this machine because it
fits perfectly in this apartment without
taking up a ton of space and it still
makes that perfect coffee it's super
easy to use and saves me so much time I
just put the capsules in and a perfect
coffee comes out there's no more
forgetting my coffee in the French press
I sip my coffee before reading and
meditating this time where I drink my
coffee read and meditate is a very
special and sacred time for me it's a
time where I get to be with myself and
calm my mind before the day begins this
part of my day is what really keeps me
grounded and my mind at peace
after I finished reading a chapter I
either set a timer or I use a guided
meditation on the app 10% happier I
meditate for about 10 to 12 minutes a
day
after I finished meditating I'll
reconnect with the world so over my
computer I'll open up my email and look
at those I'll scroll through Instagram
I'll check my Twitter and just do all
that social media stuff
I'll then throw on some music before
heading to the shower
I like to just do a quick body shower in
the morning I've been loving the body
hero by glossier body wash my hair takes
a long time to dry so it's better I
don't get it wet in the morning after
the shower I'll do my skincare routine
and get my skin prepped for makeup
now that my skin is prepped I'll throw
my hair up in a bun and do my everyday
makeup routine
for a foundation today I'm using the
Giorgio Armani luminous silk foundation
then I'm using the Kat Von D lock-it
concealer on top of that I'm gonna put
the glossy a router I've been absolutely
loving this powder it's amazing for
cheeks I'm using the glossy a cloud
paint in the color dusk
I'm bronzing up the face with the hoola
bronzer by Benefit glowing up the face
with the halo scope and courts by
glossier and finishing it all off with
the caudally beauty elixir after that
dries I'll put on some mascara usually
the L'Oreal telescopic mascara to add
some color back into the lips I'm using
the glossy lipstick in the color jam
after I'm done with makeup I'll get
dressed today was just a chill day of
editing at home so I threw on jeans and
a sweater
as you guys have seen in so many other
videos I love a good breakfast movie
today I'm just making the smoothie that
I make every morning that's filled with
nutrients and good stuff stuff to keep
me healthy and full stay tuned because I
will be doing and updated what I eat in
a day video soon
after that I pour myself a large jug of
water and I get to work thank you guys
so much for watching I really appreciate
it
peace and love I love you all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
