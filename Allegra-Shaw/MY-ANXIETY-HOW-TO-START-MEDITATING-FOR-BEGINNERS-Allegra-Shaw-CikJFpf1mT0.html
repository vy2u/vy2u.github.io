video supposed to go up tomorrow but
well that was anything and I kind of
realized that I never talked about the
backstory of why I started meditating
and how I was before sort of meditating
so I'm just gonna kind of walk you
through that before we cut into the
actual video so I have struggled with
anxiety as well as some other things for
most of my life at all my whole life but
it really kind of came together in
fourth year when I was finding it just
hard to be a normal human we reflect on
it now I don't really know how I came
across meditation but I did and it was
more of a practical thing like this is
what I'm gonna do to feel better so
that's when I started and now it's
really become part of my daily routine
in my everyday life and I am pretty
anxiety free now and it's I really
attribute a lot of that to meditation
but overall it's kind of just made me a
more mindful and more present human as
well as it's made me be able to create
happiness for myself so I'm gonna cut
back to the actual video now and these
are just you know my tests and my kind
of beginner's guide to meditation hey
guys I'll open today's video pretty
happy to do this video it was very
requested which thank you very happy
today we're going to talk about
meditation and it's kind of kind of my
like beginner's guide to meditation
I personally meditate every day and I do
it in the morning
that's just my practice but you will
find your own practice I just want to
preface this video by saying meditation
is different for everyone and I'm just
sharing with you the points that I have
learned along the way so my first point
is it's a different experience for
everyone we all procs it differently we
all do it for different reasons
and in the end we all experience it
differently the way that I started
anything is a great starting point
aren't guided meditation apps my two
favorites are headspace and temperance
unhappier I started with headspace and
then I moved
tender so happier I think that's a great
way to do it I really like headspace for
beginners it I think it starts you at
about one minute and then helps you get
up to ten minutes it has visuals it's
just a great out so if you're looking to
start
I probably start there and then once you
feel kind of like confident in your
practice and stuff I think 10% happier
is a great kind of secondary out number
three reading to get or keep you in the
mindset I found that reading before I
meditate is really beneficial to me but
you can read at any time of the day that
you want whatever works for your
schedule the books that I personally
like are Zen mind beginner's mind which
is right here it's one of my favorites
the little book of meditations I haven't
read but if we're really good things
about it and another great book is be
here now
number four try to do at the same time
every day you'll hear this in the
meditation house but making a routine
under your meditation is really
beneficial find the time that works for
you I like to practice in the morning
but you might like to practice that
night or in the middle of the day or in
the middle of the morning whatever works
for your schedule is totally okay number
five everyone can do it there's no such
thing as too short or too long or your
mind racing or that you can't do it
because you're gonna think what other
things all that matters is that you're
doing it you will learn to love your
imperfections and work through them in
then my beginner's mind there's actually
a story about these four horses I'm
gonna kind of read it to you and kind of
condense it down it is said that there
are four kinds of horses excellent ones
good ones or ones and bad ones the best
horse will run slow and fast right and
left at the drivers well before it sees
the shadow of the web the fourth or the
worst horse will run after the pain of
the web penetrates to the marrow of its
bones and the point is in your very
imperfections you will find the basis
for your firm way seeking mind often
those who find great difficulties in
practicing will find more meaning in it
number six is don't be so hard on
yourself can you do it every day or
every leap or you have to reschedule
your time
that's okay it's all part of the process
and the last point number seven is don't
expect too much try to reserve all
expectations for whatever feeling you're
hoping to get out of meditation meditate
for the sake of meditating
give it time time does everything and
whatever feeling will come welcome I
hope that helps you out on your quest to
start meditating if you have any tips
that have helped you start meditating
I'd love if you could leave them down
below for everyone to enjoy and to learn
thank you guys so much for watching I
really appreciate it
love you all he's
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
