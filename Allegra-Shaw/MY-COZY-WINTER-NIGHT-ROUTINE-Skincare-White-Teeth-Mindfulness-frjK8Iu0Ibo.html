tonight I was out for dinner around the
holidays I'm out a lot of the time so
when I get home I like to kind of relax
and take it easy and kind of Paymer
myself because this is a really busy
time of year for me so right when I get
home I take off my jacket like any
normal person but I need to thank crest
for sponsoring and collaborating with me
on this video about them this video
wouldn't happen my first and favorite
thing to do when I get home is take off
my watch and any accessories and ring
the necklaces and then put on comfy
clothes who likes to hang out in their
house in jeans mommy so I like to white
my teeth before I start any things that
I can kind of get everything I need to
get done throughout the night while the
whitening strips are working their magic
I really like the crest 3d white
Whitestrips with light I find it super
important to have clean teeth and a
white smile it helps me feel really
fresh and confident and happy with
myself
I like the crest 3d white strips with
light because they take half the time
and I see results way faster than other
out home whitening systems as you can
see here super easy to apply you just
stick them on your
teeth and I only need ten days of
treatment which is really important to
me just because the other item winding
systems I feel like you need like a
month commitment and ain't nobody got
time for that and I usually forget so
the ten days is just super fast get it
over with and the best part about it is
that the effects last up to 36 months
that's three years what next I go into
my skincare so I use an oil cleanser to
take off all my makeup and then I wash
my face with the glossy a milk jelly
cleanser I really like this it's really
soft and gentle on my skin and then I
usually would use a daily micro
exfoliant I just have run out of mine
today I also set a timer for the white
strips or else I will totally forget
when I put them on hey Siri set a timer
for one hour
continuing on with my skincare routine
I'm using the Dermalogica Fido replenish
oil I've been really liking the stuff
I'm kind of perfecting my skincare
routine right now but when I'm perfected
it I will make a video about it and I'm
using this ordinary serum I forgot the
name of it I will link it down below and
then for my night cream I use a keels
night cream
it's like unscented very moisturizing I
really like it and then my eye cream I
use a Dermalogica eye lift cream
so after all that I will usually head to
the jazz club my living room and I will
do some work so I'll finish up any
emails that he needs to do edit any
videos export videos just kind of finish
up on work I need to do for that day or
some work I need to get ahead of for
tomorrow so I will keep an eye on my
timer and when it hits about 15 minutes
I will go and find a mask for tonight I
really like the flawless by Friday masks
recently I'm using the 24 karat gold
mask tonight but they have this really
cool 5-day mask system that I've done
and I really like that one as well but
there are a ton of masks so I really it
really just depends on how my skin is
feeling that day
so then while the mask is soaking up and
I'm just finishing up the white strips
I'll usually just go on my phone go on
Instagram Twitter all those social
medias and just kind of relax for a
little bit
after the 15 minutes is up I will take
the mask off and then I'll rub the
excess into my face and kind of massage
it in massage it into my hands forehead
this is the key to the white strips is
this little light so just turn it on and
put it on your top teeth and then when
it beeps turn it on again and put it on
your bottom teeth the strip's actually
come with the light which I really
appreciate because I feel like a lot of
other products you have to buy the light
separately but this comes in all the
same package then you can remove the
white strips once all that is done I'll
really start winding down for bed so
I'll head into the bathroom and brush my
teeth it just started using electric
toothbrush and let me tell you it's
life-changing
I was always skeptical about electric
toothbrushes and now I'm in love
so depending on how I feel I will
meditate at night as well or I'll clean
up I always pull myself a big glass of
water to try to get that in my body
before I go to sleep well I'll catch up
with friends or family or Joey and I'll
hang out if he's over something along
those lines
absolute favorite part of the day
getting into bed I usually do one of two
things before I go to sleep I usually
read and/or watch movie really depends
on are tired am and then I have seem
drinking my water as well and then
that's really it I'll set an alarm and
I'll just go to bed so thank you so much
for watching I really appreciate it
he's in love I love you all
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
