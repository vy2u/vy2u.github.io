summer I guess summer now but pretty
summer in Hall um it's basically from
Victoria's Secret in Abercrombie which
was kind of weird so I usually shop but
I'm from anymore but that's where it's
from I had a video makeup tutorial that
was like different than what I usually
do like I had dark on my eyelids it was
you guys would be proud um and it was
like I get right like a chitchat get
ready with me but I didn't film my
outfit at the end so I'm thinking I'm
gonna like film it and then put the try
to put that one up the next week cuz
I've seen to film the office that I wore
that night um but yeah I haven't even
looked at the footage son named enough
oh it was good footage so we will see
but yeah I'm gonna film a quick little
haul I didn't get that much but I
thought it was worth showing you guys
I'm trying to think of this video I was
like God don't think so
um yeah okay so it's guys ready okay so
I'm gonna story that McCrum because
that's like where I got the most enough
stuff and they were having a 50% off
sale and I went to the states to get
stuff and I didn't actually end up
getting a lot which is kind of sad my
boyfriend got like so much stuff but I
didn't end up getting a lot but I got I
got some stuff an Abercrombie and OH
he should be the first things so I got
sunglasses um I have been wearing $5
sunglasses since grade 9 so they're like
the same sunglass I got this little
store so I got them a great nine so six
six years I've been wearing them that's
a long time five dogs my glasses so I
decided to get a new pair and I got the
ray-bans ribbon Club masters I guess
I'll put them on and I like I'm in love
with them they're very summery they're
the tortoise ones with I think the green
lens but I'm like so in love with them I
just think they're so submarine cool
I'll probably get a black pair of like
big ones for winter because these don't
really suit winter but I'm in love and
then Kyo if it's taken me this long to
get good sunglasses
okay yeah so I work on me um I got this
sweater and it was on sale like pretty
cheap cuz it off like $24 for sure
so it's blue and white has blue and
white stripes hood and it kinda has a
high-low thing going on it's really thin
material and I'm mostly gone for
cottages and like just chillin I like
big loose clothes in the summer and
drinks queers sweatpants are my life so
I love that I wear it all time and then
I got a jean shirt shaumbra shirt not
really sure the difference is something
like crisscross pattern stitching and
whatever I don't think it matters but I
love it it's also kind of oversized on
me it goes really long in the back so I
like cuz I can cover my big butt but I
love this shirt it looks really good for
white pants I think I was gonna get
ready with me I love it so I think that
was one sec fifty with cheaper so so
pretty good and then from the same trip
I got this half kind of least bustier
shirt
it's like brawl that sort of that like
you did wear this other shirt
um but I really like this actually it's
pretty cute weird under things I wear it
actually I wore it under a button-down
that the button kept popping open so I'd
have to like a full tank and or a half
tank and it works really well
so yeah and then I need the button down
shirts for work because I all mine are
kind of sheer so I wanted some like
thick ones so I ordered them off
Abercrombie because I couldn't I got
some from j.crew they didn't really fit
nicely so I got some however coming one
there's got a white one this is like
their classic button-down very very
Abercrombie um so yeah I got the white
one and they are on sale too which was
awesome
and then this was a little thinner
material but it's polka dot
I mean this one's super cute yeah those
are great for work they'll be good for
under
sweaters and stuff too kind of like more
preppy style Victoria's Secret I wrote a
three bathing suits off Victoria's
Secret but the black one wasn't coming
out actually saw it but whatever it was
just a black bathing suit with like a
little bit push-up I don't know it was
whatever is cute but it hasn't coming
out so I'll show you - I thought so I
got this one it's like a leopard skin
one triangle top like this has some push
up in it which I wasn't expecting it
didn't I obviously was raining out so I
got the wrong side so I always here
wasn't paying attention when I got this
it has small it's an extra small but I
think I don't know if it's if it's so
maybe extra wasn't too small but it fits
and it's great I haven't worn it in the
water yet but I love it in the bottoms
look like this and they have this little
thing so it comes out so it's kind of a
tie but not but I don't like you more
like a sexy meeting suit I select it and
then this is more like fun this is
literally I'm gonna wearing this all
summer this is my fear being suit ever I
literally love this bathing suit so much
okay so the top looks like this I've
never bought off bandeau top before or
hot but didn't look in but look at this
it's so nice and it makes my boobs look
so nice house push like a little bit
push up in it so it's just like oh so
amazing house it's ruffle it's flora
color I'm honestly so obsessed oh so
cute I mean I just baby tooth meeting a
lot of love this summer and then bottoms
look like this you can obviously get the
different types of bottoms I got these
ones these are really cute if you have a
small bum I don't have a small bum
so my bum literally eats these like eats
eats it so it's a lot of butt going on
um I mean it's nice but it's not like I
think it looks good
I guess like it it's very provocative
but not because it's like such a fun
color so I don't know it just wears like
my buddy's like variate whoa
you're but um so I mean it's good but
like wearing in front of my boyfriend's
parents I'm like oh sorry about my but
whatever but again small bun they look
what a cute being in different you can
get that other types that's my home oh
no I got this dress my this dress is
from Abercrombie also thought it was
really nice I think this is really
expensive like 80 bucks
but whatever I don't really buy a lot of
summer dresses even though I love them
but I've been wearing this like crazy
and I'm obsessive it all casual to you
this is actually the dress that I wore
and that's true I thought I was talking
about with a blazer over top so I'll try
to get that out for next week but I hope
you guys enjoy sorry I still like a mini
haul but I'll definitely have another
one I need to get so much stuff for work
and I just haven't been able to find
anything that I like so we'll see what
happens but I'll definitely another haul
summer haul up this summer and I'll
definitely buy this wall so yeah I hope
you guys enjoy it and I'll talk to you
