July favorites um July isn't a weird
month just a lot of weird things I don't
know it's just like someone was over but
I feel like it even hasn't really begun
it's weird okay so let's get started
oh my Missy's so today I'm gonna Guaymas
keep sing today but I'm gonna start out
with clothes because I love clothes
my first favorite have been these
sunglasses there are fake dr's fake look
like this look like this all I want them
in like the silver and silver and like
clear too but I love them so nice thing
about Aldo for $12 so the next showed
this in my last video is this fringe bag
from Windsor store looks like a mess
it's amazing has a school strap it's
long crossbody I have it in an Instagram
post as well just like favorite bag just
throw things and I'm not really a bag
person so when I find a bag that I
actually am using a lot it's great the
next thing are light wash ripped jeans
now I've had these for oh my god I've
had these since grade 11 and I am now
out of university so I've had these for
a really long time with the American
Eagle like look they're low-rise cuz
like look how small the zipper is is
this it why do you been up this why is
quiet little thing stop reading I've had
this for a really long time they have
huge rips in them now because I've had
them for so long I don't know how much
they were I don't think you can buy them
anymore but I just been loving these and
I've been loving jeans with boots so
these are the book to sweet like black
boots or like brown I don't know I just
love them sex favorite is not really a
clothing item but like it is I started
ballet and like beginner intro just to
like do something so my belly
want to add them they're so cute and
like girly I don't know I love them um
yeah I started ballet at the National
Ballet of Canada and it's pretty sweet
really hard so for known as a ballerina
good for you because it's actually
really difficult and that's all for
clothes I don't know I like there's
nothing that really stood out because
I'm in swap hands aha oh well hide or
like workout clothes that's literally I
go to the gym Lana mints okay and that's
about it so that's it for that and let's
move on to beauty I showed nude sticks
and I've said I've loved musics and I
still love neat sticks but I've also
been loving this concealer it's the
Maybelline fit me concealer in deep I
got this for when I was in Greece and I
was really tan but it's just really nice
it covers really well and I like the
color and it doesn't really crease so
it's a really nice concealer that I have
been using along with my nude sticks the
next thing this isn't mine it's my mom's
and I took it because I am in love with
it is the Laura Mercier body and bath
vanilla souffle body cream it looks
like this this stuff is actually
incredible it smells like amazing it's
only the best vanilla you've ever smelt
in your life it is a thick thick cream
so but doesn't feel thick on your skin
used like it's hard to rub in but once
your body soaks it up your skin is just
so soft and the smell lingers on
everything and I'm like obsessed this
smell so I love that I smell all my
towels smell like it all like my clothes
really I love it I it's just like such
an amazing smell I'm unsure of how
expensive it is I'm pretty sure we got
it for free with like a purchase or
something but I am gonna repurchase this
and I am going use it I don't use it
every day because there's I don't
wouldn't you to smell like good everyday
but I'm going on a date or like I'm
going out at night I put this on just to
like have that fragrance around oh I
love it I love it I love it I hope it's
onto something because I'm obsessed
and then to go along with that I have
been using the Marc Jacobs Daisy because
we don't really have a sense that I like
I used to wear pink sugar for years but
it's like some high school now I'm like
I'm no I I don't need to smell that
sweet anymore and I've had this one
since grade 9 or 10 and I know the smell
changes in perfumes but I think I like
the way this one has changed so I might
repurchase it might not I'm not sure
like I just find it really hard to buy
son so if you guys had any suggestions I
like something really sweet I don't
really like there's like a certain type
that gives me a huge headache like I
feel like Flowerbomb like sounds like
that I don't like umm but anything like
sweet and light I like so if you have
any suggestions please let me know
because I am looking for innocence and
the last thing is waterproof mascara
right now I'm using a Maybelline
waterproof mascara and it is incredible
I just bought her from scary when you're
like on the boat when you're in the
water it's just obviously when you're in
the water it's just like a must-have for
summer then now let's we want to
miscellaneous items I first want to have
a video if you want to see how to make
kale chips right here but Cal chips I'm
eating them right now I make these all
the time I love them mm-hmm I just love
kale chips so have them around all the
time I'm a video on how to make them
there's delicious healthy amazing snack
my next favorite is a website sign up
kind of thing Oh an email subscription
that's what it is it's an email
subscription so it's called top 10 and
what you do is you go into a website put
your email in and every Wednesday on the
day you get an email sent to your email
of a list of songs I think it's a link
to a SoundCloud actually sorry I don't a
list of songs a link to a SoundCloud
with a list of 10 songs and since you
guys love my teasing music I thought
that you would love this
because this is very much my taste music
it's one of someone I know who started
this email subscription and he has a
great taste in music so it's very
similar to mine so I thought you guys
would love it
the next thing is the Pan Am Games I
have been going to all the events gold
medal it no sorry goal now what am I
going to a diving gymnastics karate like
I'm I think they're amazing it's in
Toronto so it's been really cool to like
go out and see Canadians kick ass and
have all that national spirit but it's
been incredible it's like the city is a
disaster I mean like the traffic is
crazy and the DDP is awful but it's
really cool when you actually go to the
events and you see the athletes and you
are there in that environment it's been
so cool
so I've been they've been in Toronto I'm
the next thing is music festivals I went
to Digital dreams Osheaga sand you know
at the end of this month which is epic
it's not actually August right now it's
still July so I come you know Osheaga is
coming up which in be incredible so
excited about summery no music hustles

music festival goer but this summer I
