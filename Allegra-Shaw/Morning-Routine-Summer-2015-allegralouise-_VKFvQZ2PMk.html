okay so I have hit snooze about once or
twice and now known as 8:00 a.m. and is
the time where I just grab my phone I
check my texts my snapchat my facebook
my Instagram see what was going on while
I was snoozing we'll also do some emails
and all of that fun stuff at this time I
will then grab my computer and I will go
on YouTube or rather I'll go on Facebook
and then I will usually watch a show
that's what I've kind of been getting
into lately so either like Grey's
Anatomy or The OC or something I've
missed
that's what I'll do and then I will head
on over to the bathroom so in the
bathroom I am going to wash my face and
I'm going to be using the Dove
sensitive skin soap that's what I've
just been loving for my face it's been
working pretty well so she for all those
blemishes that I have disgusting and
then I'm going to draw my face
and then I'm going to take the body shop
vitamin E cream then loving this - it's
pretty lightweight which is nice for the
summer time and then I'm going to take
body shock tea tree oil and I'm going to
put that on all my imperfections and
then I'm going to take another acting
cream and put that on all of my
imperfections
and then like any normal human I'm
going to brush my teeth
then back to my bedroom and usually I
will meditate for about 10 to 15 minutes
depending on the day and then after that
I will get up and make my bed next I
will head downstairs and either make a
cup of coffee or a cup of tea today I am
making a cup of coffee so I'll just do
that and then at the same time I don't
any footage of this but I will make
myself some breakfast usually toast or
some yogurt with granola and berries
then I head back upstairs with my coffee
after I eat my breakfast downstairs and
I will sit on my bed and uncle in the
computer I will check YouTube I'll watch
another show and I'll just kind of take
this time to relax and chill before I
start my day after that I will head back
to the bathroom and I will put on some
makeup um check out my spring/summer
everyday makeup routine but today I just
put on a little bit of concealer to just
cover up my acne and I didn't put
anything else on then I will change into
whatever I'm wearing this day was a pre
chilled day just running some errands
and then I will grab all my necessities
keys watch rings whatever found some
shoes lock up
and then I will get in my car and go
wherever I'm going
I hope you guys enjoyed this video and
we'll talk to you soon
