going on but girls are doing some
laundry hey guys and welcome to today's
video I'm doing a summer haul I did my
summer outfits video already so I have
to pause the Washington's really like I
did my summer outfits video if you
haven't seen that already I feel like
you probably have though everyone seen
it so some of these pieces were in it
but not a lot they're actually some new
pieces and the other thing is they got
my hair done and they got my hair down
by Anita loan &amp;amp; Co in Toronto and I just
asked for a neutral blonde to kind of
just freshen it up it was getting a
little streaky around here so I like it
looks great that's why it's like blown
oh I never wear my hair straight let's
just get into it
so I think what my biggest comments on
my channel is like can you do more
affordable options so for my summer
outfits I did like an affordable blog
post to go along with that so you can
kind of get some dupes but for this
video I actually teamed up with Lulu's
calm I'm sure you know what Lou's is
they're very big on YouTube it loses
just like an online boutique they have a
ton of different styles and a ton
different price points which I think
it's awesome and I feel like this stuff
is definitely up your alley it's
affordable it's nice quality and yeah so
I teamed with them Thank You Luis for
sponsoring collaborating me on this
video I appreciate it let's just get
into it my summer home ok the first
thing is this top which I honestly love
I don't see this it's just saying a rap
table salt like raps to the front is
blue polka dots and what I love that has
which we feel like water shirts don't
have is it has this clasp where it kind
of like keeps it together I feel like
some rap tops like don't have that
costume you like bend over and softly
your moves are just out I love the color
I love the length of it I think this was
just like a pair of trousers and some
slides or even jeans and
I don't know some shoes would be a great
outfit for just a nice casual summer
dinner lightweight nice I got this in a
size small the next top I got
specifically for Osheaga it's by Free
People but you can get it on Lulu's it's
just like a red crocheted crop top I
actually wanted to get this top for
Coachella but I didn't end up getting it
so I want to wear I wore like a blue
crochet top with blue striped pants to
Coachella and I want to do the same with
like red either like this room like this
right crocheted top with either like red
pants or striped pants kind of the same
sort of look bro chaga so I got this is
a size extra small and I love it super
breezy super summery really like hippie
vibe I feel like I'm gonna do red on red
with this I feel like that's like the
bottom I want to go for it
the next thing is something I saw on
zhenia overdose I think that's how you
say her name and it's a black denim like
skirt over all set I've heard people
talk about Lulu's and it's like a
distressed black and I think this is
like this with like a sweater underneath
with like some sneakers and a coffee
like running to the head this farmers
market or something I feel like that's
like a vibe that I like it's like a nice
Jean material it's not too stiff and I
think it'll loosen up as well
it droppeth adjustable straps I probably
wear like one strap off hanging off but
easy piece of style I mean I love denim
and I think it's a great just great
summer pieces just throw on weekend by
then I got a few tops first is this
little off the shoulder cap sleeve I
don't think this is a cap sleeve but
like you know what I mean
top I think this is also is a really
easy summer pieces just throw on with
shorts or jeans kind of that retro vibe
to it I think it's really flattering it
stays up super soft material I got this
it's small and this sweater absolutely
love I love the color combination is
just a cropped sweater actually oh this
in size medium because it looked really
cropped on the model so I bought it in a
size medium
so it'd be just a little bit longer on
me again this with some jeans some jean
shorts under even not that denim set I
think would be really nice but I just
really like the color combination and
like this like ribbed stretchy material
it's like easy and breezy
and then the next shirt again off the
shoulder I thought it looked really
pretty I like the color combination to
cream in the pink and I thought this
would look really nice with some like
high-waisted white trousers or like some
white jeans I think it would just look
really chic and it's really nice
material soft and has some ruching on
the sleeves I think all this one in this
size extra small the next thing I got is
actually a set a matching set and it's
my faithful of brand but I got on lose
and it's this red pant set I love it I
absolutely love the color it's a linen
material I think it's just a beautiful
set I saw a few influencers wearing
similar sets and I just think this is
like the perfect vacation piece you just
throw it on the top the top ties in the
front it also has clasps though which I
really like ties and house clasps and
extra security in the front beautiful
red color I think like this with a pair
of sandals and like a Sun Hat and a bag
just like on vacation it's just such a
beautiful look I mean I think this is
the piece I'm most excited to excited
for but I I love love love this piece I
was I was like so stoked for it when I
got it I love a good matching set I
think they look super chic and they're
just so easy it's like wearing a dress
but like more complicated so like look
so you put more effort into it but like
he didn't you know the last thing I got
is this little woven basket clutch I
just wanted a summer sort of clutch I
think this is you know easy just to wear
casual colors the the beige and the
brown just opens up it actually does
have a chain
but I'm gonna wear it as a as a clutch
for sure but I think this even with that
red set I love that the woven basket
sort of trend is it because it makes
bags like really inexpensive they look
really chic so I obviously love this
piece thing I'm going to be wearing this
a lot this summer to a ton of different
events so that's it from Lulu's again
and thank you lou this response during
this video all the items will be linked
down below so check them out if you want
they have a ton of different styles for
summer and their i have an affordable
price point so I'm just super into that
yeah okay so the next what should I do
next I'm just one where again I have
done my a 20-18 bikini video if you
haven't seen that it is on my channel
but I want to do I bought some pieces
that I wanted to include in the video
but they just didn't come in time so I'm
gonna show you them here the first is
from the Anya Oromia we were what collab
and I got to swim students from them
they are very expensive swim because
it's the two pieces about ninety five
dollars each piece so it is expensive
top so I got that a nude color in the
two-piece the top is it fits beautifully
I got the one that has a little link
early cop sling this is a cap sleeve the
little girl II cap sleeve I love the
color this fits really well it's super
flattering and then the bottoms are
high-waisted bottoms the quality is
really there it's it's a nice feeling
bikini the only thing that I have an
issue with is that I got an extra small
which is the smallest size and it
doesn't fit my waist and that's like
like I'm a size 24 my waist is like a
24.5 like I should for sure befitting an
extra small and there's so much room in
the waist so a little disappointed than
not I just feel like the sides grading
is off so they kind of messed up on that
because there are some smaller girls out
there and they're not gonna be able to
wear these like if you're smaller than
me or work for you my size this is not
gonna fit you and it's the a smaller
size so that kind of sucks it's not only
something I feel like I can get taken in
like am I gonna can you get bathing suit
bottoms taken in feel like it's super
awkward to like stand
Taylor it is Taylor I go to with like a
bathing suit on so I don't know what I'm
gonna do and then I didn't get another
piece from them as well I'm obsessed
with this like I love all of the styles
and the patterns that she created for
the club I love the red stripe you guys
know I'm like so interests right lately
underwear fits again there's so much
room in the waist
this belt there's it's not tight on my
body it's not like form-fitting so it
doesn't like I feel like when you wear
our one-piece you really want to be like
squeezed in like you don't want it to be
like baggy so that's how this is on me
so I wish they either had I don't I
shouldn't be an extra extra slow I
should definitely be an extra small so I
just wish their science grading was
better it also kind of tents in the back
and I really don't like meetings to do
that but I think that has something to
do with the fact that there is too much
material I'm gonna how to really like it
if you're Canadian you're gonna get hit
with duties took about two and a half
weeks to arrive and I did get hit with
like $130 worth of duties really sucks
they're good quality and the styles are
like I haven't seen styles like that in
bikinis anywhere so I don't what I'm
gonna do I would like to get them take
it in I'm gonna maybe find like a bikini
Taylor or like I'm gonna get my
seamstress that makes her huncles stuff
to like Taylor for me I'm not sure we'll
see that's the kini oh god I am so I'm
so thrilled with like I am so thrilled
with it
it is my a swimwear and we all know - in
dev and they obviously wear a ton of
bikini is so like they really know what
they're doing when it comes to making a
bathing suit but I bought my mom a
bathing suit for Monday's where she was
looking for something they just put a
pool in their backyard so I got her like
a nice high-waisted bikini from there
and then I order one for myself she
really liked it and I ordered this one
piece that is an Aleppo print and oh my
god I love it
like the most flattering bathing suit
ever it's just like a classic one-piece
even has like a full bottom but there's
cups in the top that are removable so if
you don't want them can you take them
out but I feel like sometimes with one
pieces when you have small boobs they
kind of just like flatten you out just
doesn't do
at all it like curves around your boobs
because the cup it's perfect it has like
a little elastic in there the bodice is
like super form-fitting it really
cinches you in you feel very secure in
it you don't feel like anything's gonna
like pop out I'm obsessed with this I
I'm gonna get it in another color and I
really want to try out some of the other
styles as well because I just think that
Taschen def just like really know what
they're doing when it comes to designing
a bathing suit super good quality highly
recommend if you're looking for one
pieces or even like two pieces just
checking out one day swimwear amazing I
don't know I can't remember I got hit
with duties I feel like I didn't but I
could be wrong next pieces I actually
don't have one of them but I want to
show you anyway are they're from uncle
uncle it is my clothing brand if you
don't know we make ethical and
sustainable androgynous clothing that's
our whole thing and some of these as I
wanted to show you we're coming up with
three new pieces right now for summer we
don't drop full collections we kind of
keep everything all year and we come up
with a product every six to eight weeks
depending on our schedule still tryna or
hoping every six weeks but you know
we're small so it's hard the first thing
I want to show you that actually how
about me is this blouse it's a red
stripe and red stripe red striped blouse
this is a super different piece for us
we would mostly make basics this
feminist e is our if I'm gonna see
you've had this feminist II for like
over a year now and it's like one of our
best-selling items but this is something
super different for us it's more fashion
II it's more it's just like a piece
inside like a t-shirt so we made it in
this red stripe because there are
matching pants I don't have them on me
right now because they're getting
altered we're still making the garments
and I love the matching set a lot people
say look like pajamas but that's cool
like it does kind of look like pajamas
but I love that I think it looks super
chic thread almost some heels and a
clutch beautiful Gucci slides and it's
like an easy you know weekend brunch
peas brunch outfit or you can do them
separately like I'm easily where I've
worn this with jeans I've worn it with
jean shorts and then I've worn the pants
like a white tee or
tank and I think it's like such a
beautiful set or so if you buy the set
you get I think money off if you're
buying the full thing we want to
encourage people to buy the full thing
that's that and we also have a white
tunic dress you can see it in my summer
outfits video I don't have it on me
because they are it's not the pattern
maker right now I'm fixing the pattern
on the sleeves a little bit just to
tailor it in these three pieces on all
great are on presale a few people had
been asking like why were you pre-sale
we actually do pre-sale so that we know
how many to make so if you're ordering
something on presale it hasn't been made
yet and the reason why we do presale is
because we want to know what sizes we
need to make and how many of each we
should be making since they're such a
small company we don't have like super
large order volumes where we can we we
we have the data to know like how many
of each size to make so the pre sell
really helps us with that so like before
the 2d dresses we know that like smalls
are selling the best right now so we
should make more smalls and then we can
also fill everyone's orders so that's
you so if you do want something from
uncle I highly recommend my mom pre sale
you have to wait a little bit longer for
it to ship out but that means you're
definitely going to be secured with your
size so we have the tunic dress and the
striped striped webson striped pants on
the website right now a few things
revolve I got this what except like
bustier top I saw a few like influencers
wearing it and I was influenced I really
liked it but it doesn't fit my small
little boobies this is a size I think
extra small doesn't fit these little
small baby so what I'm thinking of doing
is wearing it over a t-shirt with a
broader e because I feel like it'll stay
up then tucked into like jeans you know
let me know what you think about that
kind of look I'd love to know I think
that this would be really nice dinner I
was good if I weren't over a t-shirt I
actually don't even think I'd feel
confident enough to wear this just by
itself with jeans I feel like it's not
really my style so I think over the
t-shirt will get really nice this is
ready by the brand hours and then this
dress actually worn it yet
Shirin wore it to an event and it looked
beautiful on her
it was so nice with her complexion and
her hair she wears like a like an
afternoon tea party kind of thing and
were like I read fascinator with him as
well and nude heels and I looked
stunning so this is a dress by lovers
and friends has a lace overlay on it so
pretty and I feel like this is like a
perfect dress for like a summer wedding
don't have any wanting to go to this
summer but I think it's a nice thing to
have in your closet it's just a shift
dress so really easy to dress up or down
to more dresses from revolve if you
watch my summer outfits video or you
fall in Instagram you would have seen
this dress already
again I'm obsessed with red stripes I
really got to calm down this is dressed
by a left kind of me red stripe wrap
dress that is goes down to about mid
calf so mini dress for sure
ties around the waist cinches you in
super easy like summer dress to just
throw on and go I'm all about like easy
breezy in the summer so a dress like
this is perfect for that absolutely love
love love this dress and then that's
trust I got a while ago but I've never
shown it actually worn it yet but I want
to show you guys too I think it's really
pretty it's this white polka dot dress
and it's by the olisandra rosio wine on
revolve and it has a super deep v in the
front it goes all the way down to the
floor and then also it has slits up
these front I think it's super
flattering it's really sexy I think just
this with a pair of flat sandals and
clutch would be stunning could you wear
this to a wedding or is it too white I
don't know for an any evening event I
think would just be really nice in the
summertime he gets super flattering and
a really pretty dress that's it for
clothing so let's get on to accessories
got some pairs of sunglasses from Zara
I've had tortoise you guys love these
bosses tortoise cat eyeglasses my dad
stepped on them and broke them literally
devastated their available anymore so I
hope these ones which are very similar
but they're just like a little thinner I
definitely liked why the runs better but
what can you do these
tonight I like the Cateye trend a lot
then I got the same this was the
original shape but I got them in brown
let's see yeah cute I love having like a
bunch of different sunglasses I usually
buy pretty inexpensive sunglasses oh no
like expensive sunglasses really the
most I'll spend on sunglasses usually
like $200 would share for like
sunglasses like at Ray Bans which I wear
all the time and I have my like riparian
Frog ones which are expensive but mostly
sunglasses are pretty inexpensive for me
because I love having a lot of different
styles I got these shoes from Zara just
a pair of green heels it's funny because
I was looking for a pair of green heels
last year for months and no one had them
like these only thing the only company
that had green heels were Gucci and I
couldn't afford Gucci heels so a little
pissed that I found these this year but
I think these look really chic and nice
and I just wanted them for I'm sort of
getting more into like heels and I
wanted to have wanted to have some some
colored ones and they're only 50 bucks
so the next thing I go I am literally so
excited about you have no idea um I got
a pair of common projects I would want
to use for like two years and I saw them
on sale on essence and there were like
$200 off so I got a pair they're just
white sneakers very nice quality white
sneakers they're leather and they're
made in Italy with common projects I'm
usually a size 39 like across the board
always but I did get a 38 in these the
39 was too big so just be wary about you
might need a size down when getting them
I'm super excited to wear these in Paris
I just I love white sneakers I weighed
them all the time so this to me is like
just a really easy investment piece
there winner picks off couldn't say no
the last three things I got our hats and
prepare you guys are sick of seeing this
hat and you will be sick of seeing this
hat by the end of the summer but it's
just a straw hat it's called a Spencer
terracotta from lack of color all these
hats are
from lack of color I actually wanted to
get it in a size small so I could wear
it like as a halo but they only had size
medium length so I'm not the medium so I
can wear like this I love this hat I
think it makes any outfit just look
super summery and chic I'm a huge fan of
hats and it keeps the Sun off your face
I think a lot of color just like really
nailed it they I feel like saw a little
saw a hole in the market for like nice
quality hats and they just filled it
loved it Australians just like really
not they're doing next hat is more for
fall I also got this in a medium and
it's just so bright
that's a nice shirt Thanks sorry my
cousin just like showed up at my house I
don't know what I was talking about but
here is the wool hat perfect for fall I
just I was buying from Australia so I
thought I might as well buy all the hats
that I want I wouldn't wear my hair tuck
behind my ears when I wore this but I
think this looks really nice I also
think this would look really good if my
hair pulled back I'm really excited wear
this I'm gonna want to have a cream wool
hot for a long time and the last thing I
got which was kind of like a on the whim
I got a beret I don't know why I used to
I used to wear a beret all the time when
I was like six and if I can find the
photo my dad is like photo shoot with me
like with a photographer like we do like
a family like photo shoot but then I had
like single shots of myself and I'm
wearing I have like hair like here I'm
wearing a beret
and like a plaid dress I didn't like
like glamor shots like what what was the
night hurt I guess it was I'm guessing
it was like 2001
maybe honestly maybe before that it was
so embarrassing
anyway I don't really know how to wear
braids yet let's see thinking like this
but definitely not to style it more I
don't know I like it I like the color
we'll see we'll see if I wear it I feel
like hats are just a nice
accessory for your outfit so that's my
summer haul I hope you guys enjoyed it
thank you guys so much for watching
we're gonna follow me to the scrim if
you haven't already it post most my hope
it's there and that's where I connect
with these most he's not let me go
