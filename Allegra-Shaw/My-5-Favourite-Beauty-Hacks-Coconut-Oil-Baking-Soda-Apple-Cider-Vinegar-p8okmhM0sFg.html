hacks video I'm just going to teach you
five things that you can use to be
prettier what I don't know beauty hacks
you know they are along these are all
natural well some of them to them three
of them are all natural and I'm really
into the all natural products that you
can use multiple ways you can save money
you know so the first one isn't all
natural though everyone uses dry shampoo
while most finish dry shampoo I only
wash my hair once a week which is
Thursdays so today is Wednesday hence
when my hair is in this in these braids
everyone use dry shampoo and you're
mostly told to like put in your hair in
the morning and you know go through and
you all the grease in your hair will be
gone the PD hack number one is using dry
shampoo at night before you go to sleep
so what I do is I take the dry shampoo I
put it on my roots all the way through
so that my hair is basically white
anywhere that it usually gets greasy and
then I go to sleep and the next morning
it literally is like I wash my hair it
is it such a good technique you have to
rub it in and like get flakes and
whatever it's so good do it at night
wake up your hair is clean this is my
favorite dry shampoos right now it's the
batiste dry shampoo big advance II extra
extra large volume my next video AK is
apple cider vinegar this is all natural
organic raw unfiltered apple cider
vinegar so make sure that you got the
organic all-natural apple cider vinegar
and you before you use it always shake
it up apple cider vinegar is so good for
you I actually have three things that
you can do with apple cider vinegar that
will honestly drastically improve your
life the first one I put apple cider
vinegar with some water to just kind of
like dilute it a little bit into a spray
bottle in the shower after I conditioned
my hair or before you can kind of do
whatever I just spray it throughout my
hair let it sit for like a minute or two
and then rinse it out it's really really
good for your hair um
and yes it's like an apple cider vinegar
whisk you can
also take it in a cup and just like
rinse it over your head I'm pretty sure
yeah it's really good for your hair the
second thing you can do a Posada meter
is drink it uh you put this with a bit
of water and you just chug it back like
it tastes all awful the apple cider
vinegar is so good for you and you know
beauty starts from the inside so you
really want to take care of the inside
to get all the benefits on the outside
so drinking apple cider vinegar is
really really good for you I will put a
way to drink it in the description so
that I am telling you the exact right
way um you can also just take a teaspoon
of this there's so many ways but if
you're ingesting it it's really good for
you
the third thing that you can do that
photo printer which is the best thing
I've ever discovered using apple cider
vinegar as a toner so what I did take
some soda vinegar and fill up a bottle I
filled up this Proactiv toner bottle um
so it's just empty so I put some apple
cider vinegar in here I put a little bit
of water you can also use rosehip oil to
put in I use this a calendula cranberry
facial oil but make sure you put an oil
in here just to give your skin some
moisture as well um but I think the
rosehip oil is really good as well to
use just put in this little bottle I
just shake it up I put it onto a cotton
round and I use this as a toner
I'm not kidding when I said the first
night that I use this the next morning I
saw an extreme improvement of my skin I
broke out here like last week and they
were they were big this one night
drastically improved my skin my skin's
texture is different I've been using
this every night it does smell like
vinegar so um you I think you'd want to
use it at night sometimes use it in the
morning as well if I'm just putting
makeup on and you won't be able to smell
the vinegar I just I cannot believe the
difference in my skin and I really think
that if you have any problems with your
skin you should try the outside of
vinegar toner because I think it will
change everyone's life it balances the
pH in your skin I'm pretty sure which is
why it helps me um I get a lot of cystic
acne and that's all about your pH
balance so I'm just in shock with how
good
this works on your skin so apple cider
vinegar a little bit of water and a
facial oil all together mixed together
into this put on a cotton round after
you wash your face put it all over I
trust me daddy
you will see a difference the third
thing is among three right yeah the
third thing is coconut oil there's so
many different things that you can do
with Coach model you can cook with it
you can you know do what so many things
the three things that I'm going to show
you how to Herman tell you how to do
with coconut oil is a hair mask just put
it on your hair for about half an hour
um to an hour you can even sleep with it
on but you don't time half an hour an
hour and then wash it out and your hair
will be silky smooth the next thing is I
use coconut oil on my body instead of a
lotion a lot of the time it really is
oily and like you have to let it sink in
which takes a while but your skin just
is so soft after it's really good after
let you have a sunburn I put it on and
like it just was so moisturizing it also
smells pretty nice I mean I like the
smell of coconut oil so it smells pretty
nice so I think it's all around a great
all natural moisturizer and the last
thing that I think is freaking amazing
is I quit I get cankers so like a mouth
ulcer if you know that is they're not
cold sores they're like inside your
mouth and it's just like a an ulcer um
and I used to get them a lot more than I
get now but they still suck actually I
would right now if you take this and you
put on your finger or cotton swab
obviously wash your hands fuse your
hands and you put on the ulcer it heals
it as well as it numbs it for a short
while it gives you some pain relief
which is always nice but it also is
healing it and I think this like was
just life-changing for me because I have
a lot of issues with hankers so I think
that's really great you can also do oil
pulling with this where you swish around
your mouth it's really good for you but
there's tons of tons of benefits of
coconut oil now when you get hit with
coconut oil get virgin coconut oil
coconut oil and not the refined one
because they're fine
smells awful coconut the next thing is
an all-natural teeth whitener and it's
just baking soda so what I do is I take
the baking soda I put it on my
toothbrush just right on there
I brush my teeth normally I rinse it off
and then I brush my teeth normally with
a toothpaste and it really does make a
difference I have sensitive teeth so
using a teeth whitener for me can be
kind of hard because sometimes it hurts
my teeth so the baking soda really
changes that your teeth color and it's
all natural which is the next one is
just a way to use hairspray and a
toothbrush take an old toothbrush put
some hairspray on it and you can put it
on your eyebrows and it puts your
eyebrows down so you don't to buy like
an eyebrow gel um and trust me I need
eyebrow gel but the hairspray on the
toothbrush I've never actually bought my
eyebrow gel the hairspray toothbrush has
always worked for me as well as for
flyaways same thing hairspray and a
toothbrush and you just comb your little
flyaways down and all the flyaways are
gone that is it for my big hacks a quick
video but I hope you guys learn
something um if you have any questions
or anything let me know a little bit I'm
pretty sure is a pretty straightforward
video I hope you guys enjoyed it thank
you for watching my videos and I will
talk to you soon peace out
