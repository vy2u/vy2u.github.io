so with March Break reading week summer
coming up I thought I'd do a video to
share with you my favorite bikini I'm
not a person who buys like hundreds of
bikinis because I just usually end up
wearing one the whole summer anyway but
I have a few that I really really like I
really want to show you and some new
ones so let's get into it my personal
favorite from last summer was from
Victoria's Secret and I usually don't
buy this kind of cut oh this kind of cut
in bikini but honestly I loved it so
much so here's the top it's a bandeau
style top it just looks like that
so it fits like it give us a really nice
boob because there's some push up in it
and like if I don't wear it push up one
of these my columns like really grows
here so the push of just adds some like
lift makes you look very nice I love the
print it's kind of dull now because I
wore well so everybody needs to be so
vibrant and then the bottoms probably
would have opted for another bottom
because these show a lot a baby but they
just look like this and they have like
the scrunchie thing yeah it goes
together really pretty it's really
really cute looks good of tan
so yeah that's what Victoria's Secret I
don't love lost your no showcase my next
one um which I haven't actually got to
haven't actually worn it yet because I
just received it and it is snowing
outside still and it did not go me
ruining me anyway and I can actually use
some match what these is just a solid
piece but so this bikini was actually
sent to me um it's made by Bota and this
is been seen and Sports Illustrated and
all those top swimsuit models who wore
them so I just got this purple so I'm
trying this purple one and it's kind of
like frilly this is also a scrunchie bun
I don't really need it but I mean it
makes your butt look really nice fishing
it is small um and then the top is where
all the magic happens so it just looks
like a normal triangle key top but it
has some push up in it it's a new
concept design bikini made by the
international model Yulia and wear
normal normal cups would say wrinkled
this stays firm and makes your boobs
look amazing this company has come up
with the first line to actually flatter
small breasted women so or it can even
be used to shape larger breasted women
to make your boobs appear nicer um not
so much fuller for my dress early but
odd more support make them look perky
and nice whereas for smaller breasts of
women it kind of gives you that cleavage
that you want pushes them up makes them
look a little bigger than they are
is it a featured in many many Zealand
style and I'm pretty sure all the
bachelorettes from the bachelor and
bachelorette wear these I know Desiree
from Posche rep was wearing one has she
is not very trusty and any of your boots
look amazing um I'll probably have a
video of me putting it on right here but
it's it's actually amazing because it's
like it just looks like a normal kini
talk but it makes my boobs look way
nicer so I will show what it looks like
they have many many different styles and
colors there's tons and tons of
different styles with the same patented
with the same Cup
kind of thing I got mine from the store
called Cologne a and colonias was
started by a girl in woman in my
sorority um and she's done her company
and there's web sites everything with me
down below really check it out it has
amazing amazing bathing suits as well as
lingerie and men's stuff and there's
actually I think about contests
illegally down below please check it out
actually unreal so she sent me this
beginning to test out and I fell in love
but yeah you can get go to at clonaid
and you can also get it I'm pretty sure
other places but check out Cologne in
support my sister so yeah okay and the
last bikinis I love I love solid colors
I've always really been about solid
colors just easier to mix and match I
don't know it's just um I likes all
color bikinis I'm going to Spain in May
and I was planning on going away this
reading week but I didn't happen and I
liked how tan balm I would not really
wear these by the pool or like in
Toronto or anything like either more for
like tropical beach location or like
European location for me but I kind of
been obsessed with like the long bikinis
like that these are really really little
I do not think that they're going to be
this little these are from POC Aloha I'm
gonna link the website below is it extra
small they're really little but they're
really good quality and I'm a pink one
that is in the thong autumn as well and
then I got a red one in it's like kind
of like thong but it's like a little
bigger and it has a scrunch foam so it
goes
but it just covers water and so that's
red and then I didn't even buy a top I
just was planning this is a little faded
now but I was just planning on using
like a this is for my old navy it was
like three dollars just maybe he's like
a red top cheap whatever and so I got
that and then I have black and then also
I don't know why I'm so nice crunchy
bombs on my bombs so big don't like them
but I feel like that's like the only
styles I could find now it was like
here's look at my bow I like black I
love black I love red and apparently
with purple oh so yeah that is those are
your kind of key knees I really do like
the string where they called triangle
bikinis more than the band oh they just
Vinod doesn't really look good to me
that's the only one that I really found
that looks nice on me but I'll be gives
you some ideas and some companies my dad
just makes me so cute but this gives you
some ideas that companies with Tori
secret check out : a for some higher-end
bathing suits as well as pack Aloha for
kind of more like Maui Hawaii kind of
Australian surf bikinis so those are
three great companies that sell keys and
yeah that's my video I hope you guys
enjoyed and I will talk to you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
