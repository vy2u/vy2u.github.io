self tanner team which is long-awaited
and for this video I partner with Schick
and the V nose legs you'll love program
and if you wanna learn more about that
you can visit your local shoppers Drug
Mart if you're Canada but I'm just using
their products to get to my gluey bronzy
tan and yeah you can also incorporate
these products at your everyday life
because they're just body washes
moisturizers and shaving products so you
use them everyday so you wanna learn how
I get this ten just keep watching the
first thing you want to do is hop in the
shower and I'm gonna use the Aveeno skin
relief gentle scent coconut body wash on
a loofah to gently exfoliate and make my
body soft and smooth this stuff smells
so good a super creamy and then you can
take a harder two later for like your
feet and your hands and whatever and
then you want to take a gel this is the
skintimate skin therapy sensitive skin
very nice leaves your skin very hydrated
and then obviously shave your legs you
need to do that and this is this Schick
Hydro silk trim style razor I've talked
about this before
five curved sensing blades gives you a
nice close shave and easy to get swaps
like your knees and everything popping
out of the shower I'm using me loving 10
- our dark Express and I'm taking a mint
and as well as a kabuki brush and a
synthetic brush so I'm going to start my
face and put a product on a kabuki brush
which is just a very light layer around
my face focusing on the spots that the
Sun would naturally kiss my face and
then I just blend blend blend so I like
to a light layer on the face I just take
that kabuki brush and I blend it out and
then I'll go in with the clean synthetic
brush and even blend it out more so that
it's way more natural and flawless I
also like to use the Kabuki brush on my
chest area I just think it looks really
natural and then I bring it up my neck
and everything so that I'll do the same
thing with the Kabuki brush and then
I'll take that clean synthetic brush and
I'll go over it for that flawless finish
to protect your hands
taking the Aveeno daily moisturizing
hand cream this has coital oatmeal which
creates a protective barrier for your
hand then taking the vino sheer
hydration lotion the stuff absorbs
really fast so it's really great for
this routine I'm just putting this on my
elbows and anywhere that I don't want
the self-tan to stick to and I will also
be putting this on my whole body after
then going in with the loving tan on the
mitt just buffing that out all over the
body and yeah getting your tan on so for
my arms I'll use the mitt as you can see
and then my hands let's drag down the
product then take that clean synthetic
brush and blend it all out it really
creates a flawless finish and I'll do
this exact same process on my legs as
well so using the mint and then blending
it out in synthetic brush the very thing
in the loving tan is the scent isn't
that bad isn't really smell about much
like self-tanner and it dries really
fast so after that I'll put on a robe
and chill for two hours or I'll sleep
with the tan once you create a really
dark tan or will just let it drive and
I'll throw my clothes and run errands
for the day whatever but make sure you
wait two hours two hours later after the
time is up I'll hop back into the shower
and I will cleanse my body I'll use the
Vino skin relief gentle scent coconut
body wash again I just really love the
way this smells so I like that
after I hop out of the shower I'll take
the Aveeno sheer hydration lotion and
I'll put this all over my body it's a
super lightweight absorbs really fast
it's non greasy so I love that and also
keep your tan lasting a long time if you
apply it everyday and we can also put it
on our legs now because a lot of time
has passed since we've shaved and we
won't get that sticking your irritation
which is great if you guys enjoyed this
video it is summer times we're doing
base tan but this is what I do
year-round to create this tan that I got
going on usually go for like special
occasions or events uh that's all I'd
say I hope you guys subscribe some of
this video you can comment do all that
good stuff
this room but yeah I love you all thanks
