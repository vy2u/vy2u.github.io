with no makeup on so you can see how my
skin looks now I'll insert a photo of
how my skin was before and how its
cleared up in this video I actually
forgot one step the toner which is an
apple cider vinegar toner that I'll
explain in the voice-over but it's just
apple cider vinegar and like a face oil
mixed together with some water and
that's what I use as a toner and that is
what I I really think has helped my skin
as much as I don't know what I'm going
here that's what I think really helped
with my skin clear up was the apple
cider vinegar so um this is what I've
been using for the past I would say
three months the eye creams are new but
the avocado eye cream I've had a couple
samples of those I'm kinda going through
them but my skin is like drastically
better than it used to be I really don't
break out anymore it's very very rare
that I break out so I just want to show
you my skin and yeah I mean I do still
have some acne scarring but I'm hoping
that will clear up or if you guys have
any suggestions on how to get rid of
acne scarring I would love to use your
suggestions so without further ado let's
get into the video so I just first start
by putting my hair up obviously if you
like every girl just puts their app when
they want to wash the face and then I
wet my face with some water and then for
the cleanser that I'm using I won't be
repurchasing this one but it's just the
Proactiv facial cleanser amazing this
for a while but feel like I don't need
to exfoliate as often as this anymore so
I'm going to get a new one and yeah so
just wash my face with that and then
this is where I do the toner which is
the apple cider vinegar toner and then
after the toner I just wipe off any
mascara residue this mascara was really
hard to get all four forget what I was
wearing
but I'll if I'm wearing a lot of makeup
I will use some coconut oil to take off
my eye makeup but I didn't think that I
make be really hard to is just mascara
but it was difficult
and then this is a new thing it's the
body shop drops of light and it uses
twice a day so he's just that morning
and night and it's just like a serum
that I just put on my face and I've been
really liking it again this mascara just
wouldn't come off so I'm just taking a
q-tip and getting it off and then I'm
using the Lancome Visionnaire face cream
of been using this for about a year now
a year and a half now and I really like
it for eye cream I'm using the Kiehl's
creamy eye treatment with avocado I just
get have been getting samples of these I
wanted to test it out before I bought it
and I really like it it's super super
hydrating so I've been loving that and
then I just thought obviously under my
eyes and then any leftovers I put on my
lips because it's very moisturizing then
I've been pairing it with the heels
midnight recovery eye cream so I put
that on top because the woman at the
store said to do that and she said it's
really good combo if I have any sets I
use the Mario Badescu drawing motion the
nukes is for my lips and that is really
all for my skincare routine I hope you
guys enjoyed this video and I will talk
to you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
