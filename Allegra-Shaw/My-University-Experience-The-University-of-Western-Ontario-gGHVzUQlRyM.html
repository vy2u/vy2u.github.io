university QA that I said I wasn't into
a couple weeks ago just gonna pull up
some questions um I tried to hold this
once before and I just was very
scatterbrained and I feel like I again
am scatterbrained
so I don't know how this is gonna go so
I went to the University of Western
Ontario in London Ontario which is about
two hours southwest of Toronto so not
that far away from home um and I just
graduated last year so I graduated with
a degree a honour specialization in
history um and yes um so first question
is how was your general experience at
Western um I didn't have a good first
year but after first year I really found
out the school and I really I really
loved it and how did you decide what
made you want him to okay so when I was
graduating from grade 12 I like didn't
really know where I want to go I kinda
had no interest in life when university
is kind of I'm supposed I was just not
really in a good place to decide what I
want to for the next four years I
actually ended up going to Russia at
Western so brushin see all girls
affiliate of Western um and that's why I
did not have a good first route first
year I didn't like the res and really
make any friends and I just didn't it
just wasn't enjoyable for me but I chose
to stick it out another year and I've
been second year and lived with five
guys and from that I knew from like high
school and stuff and I had a great
second year I joined Greek scene and
that's when I really start to fall in
love with Western and I really think the
Greek scene helped me fall in love with
Western um so that being said I think
that when you're choosing a school and
if you're specifically looking at
Western I don't think you should throw
away the affiliates just because you
know I had a bad experience Western has
changed a lot since I was in first year
and I think it's tuned for the butter
but the affiliates like Kings here on
and brush' are all great schools and you
graduate with a Western degree but
they're actually easier as in the
classes are smaller so you get more
attention and you kind of like know your
prof. better and you know having
relationship with a crop is so key at
university I have a lot of friends that
went to here on and they like absolutely
loved it and if I could go back I
probably would go to here on but I was
out Russia for sure and in second year I
switched to main campus um so as I said
I didn't enjoy first year for a those
reasons I think everyone on my floor
like Russia was just like a kind of a
closed door environment enough no one
really like want to like party or
whatever so just like wasn't really for
me and I just didn't really make a lot
of friends um I was that was basically
it
um I spends a lot of time in med CID
which is another res on campus cuz my
guy friends from high school were there
so I spent a lot of time there and I
really liked it so I again if I could go
back like I probably would choose med
severe on or something along those line
um I didn't also in for sure I didn't
join anything and I think that is a big
mistake because it is for it to make
friends in university like it can be so
think if you don't really have any
friends like wonder floor you don't see
yourself becoming friends I mean he/she
everyone ever want a shot but you don't
really like see yourself becoming
friends with with the people on your
floor
honestly just joined something like I
wish though I had John McCree scene in
the first year but there are so many
clubs and stuff so I really do recommend
I think everyone will give that advice
is like get involved in your school and
you'll just enjoy the experience
more when I first started University I
actually was a psych major so I went
into social science go with the path to
being a psychology major I majored in
psychology because you pick your major
option first year so majored in
psychology and like absolutely hated it
as soon as I majored I like completely
regretted it
I'm just there's a lot of math involved
and nothing I'm um I'm not bad enough
but it just doesn't it takes me way
longer than University math goes like
every class you'll be switching a
subject in math when like I needed more
time
I have tutor in high school and like I
don't think I'm bad at math but I'm not
like amazing at it so um yeah it just
really wasn't for me also yeah it just
really I just didn't like it so I
started in second year I kind of realize
it like I loved history and I started
taking some history classes and in my
third year I fully majored in history
when I just got my prerequisites took
some summer courses so I kind of jammed
a four-year honor speche into two and a
half years which was pretty insane like
I was very very stressed out and I don't
recommend doing that the amount of
papers I had to write was insane I'm the
guidance counselor saying I really don't
recommend what you're doing on your
schedule ones like no I need to graduate
with the right degree I can't be here
longer than four years um so yeah and I
honestly thought when I graduated I
thought that I was just getting a major
like a normal major in history so
there's no way that I got anything
better than that because I switched so
late and then before graduation I like
to see what my graduation wasn't it said
like he got an honours specialization in
history I was like what like I literally
found out a month before graduating that
I had that degree just insane
okay so you got picking your res and
stuff I mean like it's really you just
have to go to the University that you
want to go to when you have to like
check out all the rest of our different
styles or resins that are like normal
Reza's with the you know roommates and
whatever their singles there's singles
with sharing bathrooms there's apartment
style there's so many different kinds
it's just it's honestly personal
preference to what you want basically it
um in terms of food usually they have
like a meal plan can really get out of
it foods usually not that great to be
honest so I mean can't really do
anything about it but keep like a mini
fridge or something in your room like
some snacks like a kettle or something
that's what I did cath usually has kind
of weird hours to umm but yeah like you
just gotta do it everyone everyone does
first yes so you have to like just do it
in terms of studying just do your work
like you're going to go when I first
went to her says like wow you were she's
so easy a good one side homework like
well I'm gonna watch Netflix all day and
badly no you can't do that because of
these hands around you're not gonna get
good grades even if you like cram laughs
and you're probably not gonna get the
best grades I think I found my groove in
terms of studying and writing papers by
fourth year by fourth year is getting
very good grades and I was very happy
with myself but I do wish that I had
started earlier just like you know doing
my work so coming home from class and
like doing my readings and stuff um you
just do them I mean I'll just do your
work like the things with university is
it's actually impossible to do all the
work that you're inside so you cannot
like prioritize what work
you you want to do or like you have to
do so you know start writing that paper
early skim the readings
and like finding major points of the
readings and stuff like that said it
like reading word-for-word and taking so
many detailed notes just do like find
the whole like understand the whole idea
instead of like the specific points for
studying um it is important to have a
relationship with your profs so I mean
you should go to office hours and the
closer right relation will have my prof.
usually the better my grade was um so
just use their office hours like that's
what they're for um roommates my
roommate was a foreign exchange student
from China we work friends like
shouldn't really speak English that well
so it's kind of there's a huge language
barrier and I yeah we weren't really
friends we just got like did our own
thing but I mean a lot of people that I
know like their first year roommates
became they're really good friends so it
just says luck of the draw really if
you're just doing like a random roommate
I think you can have a job and work
sorry you kind of a job and university I
had job all of second year and I worked
three days a week at a bank just to find
a job that works for you and you have to
be really good at time management and
like really focus your time I feel like
I went out a lot I got my work done and
I worked a job and you know I felt like
I was really balanced so you just have
to be productive and like you know if
you know you want to go up this Thursday
night then like do all your work
Thursday during the day like go to the
library during the day and then you just
have to what you have to do is treat
University like a full-time job so like
9:00 to 5:00 or you know whatever is
work time and then you can go in at
night basic
that's kind of how I saw it like it was
just like a full-time job I do really
think that the Greek scene change my
university experience I think that had I
not joined the Greek scene I wouldn't
have had the experience that I had I
like loved Western I literally just got
back from Western today I went to visit
some friends who take capture say and I
think the school is an amazing school
and like I felt like I had a very
well-rounded education as I got like a
great social aspect of it because you
know as much as you are in university to
get good grades like you also were there
for the social aspect of it so I
wouldn't write that off um in terms of
like what you're looking for um and I
yeah so that's basically it and then I'm
so after a second year after I live with
five guys I met some girls my sorority
became really good friends um and I
moved in with one girl in third year so
we lived in a two-bedroom apartment and
then fourth year led with sr-- in and my
the girl that I lived again a third year
he's probably seen her my vlogs um if
you've watched her that long and we all
live together a fourth year in like a
big apartment and we lived with all her
friends it was literally like the cast
or the situation of friends like the
apartments on the floor like we edit the
best fourth year and um yeah I like when
I look back on university like I I loved
it and I'm very happy as to how my path
went and I think that is because the
Greek scene and because I felt like I
had a smaller community inside of
Western um that's basically all I have
to say uh if you have any other
questions I can maybe do like a part two
so you can think of a comment down below
people have any
questions but you kind of just have to
like you have to do it yourself and you
like have to figure it out on your own
and no one can really like tell you how
to do University because everyone's
university experience is going to be
different if you're applying to
university I was and you know you're
doing your acceptance I would say don't
go just because your friends are going
you have to enforce it you want to go do
so just keep that in mind but that's all
I have to say I hope you guys enjoyed

requests kind of like I don't I don't
really have any ideas right now so
