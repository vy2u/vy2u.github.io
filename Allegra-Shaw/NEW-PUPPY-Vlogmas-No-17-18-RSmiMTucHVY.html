think 17 I'm not really sure right now
I'm looking for my hat I can't find it I
have to sit down oh I'm pretty hungover
like did not take care I didn't drink
water when I got home last night as my
head really hurts so I'm gonna go get a
tea and then I have to go find some I
have to find some vintage denim for the
uncle we did to shun them socialites for
that and I also really want to buy like
a big faux fur coat or like vintage
furry no um yeah that's the plan oh I'm
just dying right now I can't put my
heart it's actually pretty warm outside
it's like maybe five degrees pretty good
but there's a lot of snow and like snow
like crazy last night
I've come to the conclusion that I
actually I wasn't hung over I like feel
really sick and not like a hungover away
and like a I am sick sort of way like
sneezing coughing all that gross sort of
stuff so that's probably why I'm like my
head hurts so badly this morning so um
you know Stan tonight I think I'm going
to Pender's gonna come over we're gonna
watch a movie and eat some pizza and I
mean she has a Christmas party that's
just to go do and she said I could go if
I wanted to but I don't see how I feel
so yeah that's what's going on said
Libya was lying in bed like I went for a
walk today I went to go pick up some
jean jackets and like oh my way to the G
guards like I felt I was in apostate and
I had like a strict drinking water and
stuff and then I came home and like I
was just a lot I watched the Family
Stone and I was like lying in the dark I
just felt like yeah I pretty sure
like I'm actually sick my hair looks
pretty good it's always a plus and this
bit go watch the beginning of walk mess
like day one I was on my face but then
go watch last year's vlogmas and I hide
one I'm pretty sure either this side
with this side I actually run a bit mess
on one inside that I had it for like
three weeks - so weird why do I remember
that I had to save really three weeks
it's Saturday night I am staying
in I'm so tired and I'm watching me see
the st. Louis st. Louie hey say it leave
a comment down below saintly wist
or st. Louie she just explained so I'm
gonna go with her opinion oh no she
sings see Louie used can't see Bobby
walk was stay 18
I literally just opened my eyes and I
went on YouTube it's Sunday it's 9:30 or
you know really last night
but I just wanted YouTube and all your
comments are so nice and I love when
someone writes a mean comments on one of
my videos then you guys attack though
it's too funny I love it
but yeah I just went on YouTube it knows
we're gonna call this and there's also
nice it just looks so nice to wake up to
again my movie was so close to my face
heading to Kendra's boyfriend's place
I'm going to eat their leftover
breakfast because
that's our mom and dad do give me
breakfast
and then I'm gonna head to myself what
if it's ever been we're gonna get an
Instagram and we're gonna make cookies
happy Sunday
I'm just making some potato wedges and
some kale chips for dinner that's all I
have left I'm gonna do a Q&amp;amp;A because so
people send me some questions on Twitter
and I'm just gonna go over them
obviously like when I want to do Q&amp;amp;A I'd
like just took off my makeup so don't
mind what's going on my face right now I
have a huge sit here okay so what first
question I'm just going to go through
them I haven't even looked at them what
made you start your channel I was like
in I was 18 I had been watching YouTube
videos and I was always that person that
like people went to for like hair and
makeup sort of things and I was just
like I'm gonna do it and I was like I
think it could be cool so I did that and
definitely took a while those kind of
did as a hobby at the beginning and
didn't really post that much I kind no
idea I was doing and then in just when I
graduated University I I didn't even
know that not even when I graduated I
would say like I had had one big brand
deal while I was in University
I didn't really take seriously and I
didn't really understand what I was
doing and it's just like a very hard
brand deal and then I graduated I did
the summer and then that fall I was
looking for jobs and then you know I was
just I just decided like you know I'm
gonna do youtube full-time and since
that decision my channel has like
exploded in like that I hit 50,000 and
like October and then since then so I
that was like a year ago and since then
I'm just approaching 200,000 so since I
took it seriously my channel is just
like exploded which is amazing is there
a meaning behind my name not really like
if my name is an Italian name I guess
there's a meaning my name is an Italian
name
my dad is musician Allegro his musical
term Allegro is the feminine of the
musical idea planner or calendar yeah I
had well I have my calendar my computer
that I use and I have a black book that
I just write everything down do you
believe that a guy will text you and
make time for you if he really likes
your it depends on his character no like
he'll make time for you if you like Co
he will not necessarily text you I think
that's a very like millennial kind of
thing I think that he will make time for
you I think texting all the time just
dies out as he goes right I hate texting
all the time but he will make time for
you when he doesn't then he's it's not
like he maybe he doesn't like like he
might like you but he just is not
looking for the same thing you're
looking for a few guys aren't on the
same page I'm scoring about Friday deals
I guess I asked this a while ago any
trips or vacation okay so Black Friday
deals um yeah I got my caught and
citizen stuff that's all I bought I
think I got that on Cyber Monday but
that was all at thought and any trips or
vacations planned if not where would you
go I really thought about off to
Paris for like a few days by myself but
I just I didn't pull through on that
nothing planned right now hopefully I
will go away in the winter like hanging
out with winter now but like in January
February means that Costa Rica or
something and just see what the girls
want to do and hopefully we couldn't
sort us some just nice when I go away
what do you love hate about the holidays
I like buying gifts to people and I also
don't like the gift to giving aspect I
think it's just like a consumer thing
that has just kind of like a no hang out
or I don't really know it's it's really
nice and like I get it but I feel like
everyone stresses I was over the money
thing and I don't like that and I love
you know see my family and I like that
like holiday spirit and I like that like
lights that are everywhere it's nice
what was your high school experience
like very weird I've changed friend
groups a hundred times I was a floater I
never really had like solid friend group
I kind of you know I played sports but I
also like did drama and I was in
knitting club and sometimes was in the
computer lab but I just like I was very
all over the place
bullied and you know green eye but bully
when people started figuring out at the
end of high school and people figure out
if I did YouTube I got bullied I had
some like it family should happen that
made me a nightmare to probably you know
be around it just there's a lot of
change and it was like a shitty weird
time and I was ready to get out of there
by the end but it was a good time and I
learned a lot some Tim in his high
school so I feel like yeah that's cool
what inspired and the name uncle and
glad when I was a thing in Cameron Bure
if you ever said it um
so blah drags I ministered I'm a history
major so glad rags it's like a British
war term I'm pretty sure people still
use it now but it just means like your
big clothes your nice clothes so we
thought that was really cool and uncle
it's just like a cool name that we that
I'm not taking credit for because my
cousin came up with it everyone you
should call my Uncle Bobby B and there's
just we really like the name uncle that
was it
okay a lot of you asked about uncle or
Gladrags or even just like starting your
own business and how I started I came up
with the idea for at the university that
we want to start our online store and we
just did research like I don't you know
it's good to like reach out people and
having a mentor I think is like really
great and I kind of just found my mentor
in this business so I'm
I'm just like coming into that but we
literally just did research and like
made a lot mistakes we've got an
investor we put in our own money like we
just knew we wanted to do it so we did
it it takes if you're thinking or doing
is it takes a lot of work and I think
people underestimate how much work it
actually takes to launch not just an
online store any kind of business you
have to do so much your up so late and
like always working and it takes a time
initiative and a lot of shitty work and
work that you don't really want to do
don't really like but like you know you
have to do like I do all of this stuff
and there's three of us and it's a it's
a nightmare like it's hard it's so hard
but like I love it so it's worth it and
I want I like I love I also love YouTube
and this is a whole other business on
its own but I want this both of these
things to be my career forever I mean at
this point my life I want that so I have
to work to get it to make uncle a
profitable company right we want to we
want it to be like a super profitable
self-sufficient company that has
employees and it has an office then it
has you know like oh that's what I
that's my dream for it I want it to be
like a great Street where Premium basics
brand we want it to be an affordable
premium basics brand that's like our
goal and I think we've got there and
we'll have like the whole design aspect
on some will have some basics and I'll
just be like this great place you can go
and get basics but you can also take a
really cool unique pieces and it'll just
like we just have such a big dream for
it and it takes a lot of work to make a
dream happen and that could be said for
literally any business and I hop or
whatever and yeah so oh someone asked
what does a network do for you so I am
with kin community they are my network
or multi-channel network so basically
what a network does is they have a bunch
of youtubers and under their like
