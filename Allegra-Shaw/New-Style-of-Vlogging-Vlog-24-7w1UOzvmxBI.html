I got really inspired to start blogging
more and I've been really inspired by
watching vloggers I never used to watch
vloggers because I usually just watch
youtubers that would like help me learn
stuff but I realized the that it is so
important to watch laughter's to get
inspired to make my own vlogs and not
just have them be what act like what I'm
doing just make them like a little more
artistic and actually put effort into
the vlogs and make them cool and
interesting
no way she performed my filmmaker or a
vlogger but I thought it'd be cool to
try something new try something
interesting and be creative while
filming my day isn't kind of giving you
a more in-depth look into what I do I
won't be doing these every day but maybe
once a week would be cool we'll see how
it goes
comment down below if you like this
video I know you're probably only like
two minutes into it but after you're
done watching comment down below if you
like this video and you like the style
it's more Kacey nice that Ben Brown sort
of vlogs but I'm kind of into that whole
like filmmaking vlog thing

clothing company it's like you doing
special appointments so let's take you
along with me

for everybody got here and then yeah I
have a bra and I don't want to strapless
bra so it's kind of tucked them under
Shamus we want to get here I'm just like
not looking for this really anymore yeah
I changed I wasn't feeling it feel more
of a chill vibe
so it's actually in a vlog today to add
on to the vlog I was doing on Saturday

it is currently pouring rain outside and
yeah we can't do a flourish through the
pouring rain so I don't know what I'm
gonna log anymore so I just got finished
up the gym and as I was leaving it's
like figured first like thinking so
funny cuz like I go to the gym obviously
to stay healthy and stay healthy but I
obviously like go for aesthetic as well
like I go so that my body looks nice but
then I wear like baggy clothes and I
feel like I told the gym cuz like go
every day and I see them every day and
like I walk in looking like I wear baggy
clothes and then I work out and like
leggings whatever and then I get back
into bed clothes are probably what the
 I started this funny probably not
so funny
bring what are you
yeah for you let's go down
so today I'm having some ladies clean my
apartment now I know you're thinking
you're like why can you just think
you're proper yourself and I usually do
but if lived there for almost a year now
but I've never I like deep cleaned and
they're like cleaning the shower and
stuff so I thought it was time to get
it is like maybe 20 degrees I've been
helped yeah thank you
see I don't even know why I bought a
green tea at Starbucks when I have tea
here but I'm in the lineup Starbucks I
always panic and I'm like what am I
gonna get I don't know and they have
these Christmas drinks and I want to try
one but I also trying to not eat a lot
of shitty food so I don't know what's
your favorite drink at Starbucks let me
know because I'm looking for a new one
it's right now cuz in the summer this
summer I would always drink iced coffees
and then I felt like I was getting fat
not fat
but like I didn't feel healthy so I
stopped and now I drink green tea there
but when you can just make them at home
and I just needed new Starbucks drinks
so I also got a bacon e Gouda breakfast
sandwich no who cares it seems to be a
lot of speculation as to why laterite is
closing now I mean explain this to you
so basically lottery wasn't a failure by
any means we're actually doing very well
but at this moment in time in my life I
was running three companies and it was
just way too much for me and I felt like
it wasn't putting all of my energy into
one including company I was splitting it
between two and it just didn't seem
logical so we did was just a mouth main
and everything and now it's just gonna
be uncle it wasn't because binary was a
failure act she was doing really well
but we just felt that uncle had its own
identity uncle knew what it was and we
just we just had more but the love for
uncle so we're closing down glad rags
also I was doing YouTube right so I had
to split my time between three different
companies now I only have to split my
time between two

some food somewhere because like I
thought they were coming at like 1:30
and they came right up three which is no
I whatever

cleaned gonna head to the mall and pick
up some things
