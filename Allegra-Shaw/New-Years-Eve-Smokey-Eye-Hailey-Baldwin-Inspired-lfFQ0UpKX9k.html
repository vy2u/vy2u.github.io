lens so I'm kind of getting used to it
but I just filmed this makeup look which
is inspired by Haley Baldwin's and it'd
be great for new years because it's a
nude lip and a dark eye and you can do
all the kissing that you want I keep
checking the definer to make sure it's
in focus because I'm just getting used
to it but if you want to know how to do
this look just keep watching I'm using a
lot of colors from the cup on the shade
light contour palette and yeah I hope
you guys enjoy and I will talk to you
soon so I'm starting with this light
beige color in the kat von d palette and
I'm going to use this all over the lid
as the base to the look and then I'm
taking the black in the palette and I'm
putting this on just the lid portion and
this will be the base to the actual
smokey eye for the look just a heads up
Lighting's going to change from this
beautiful clear nice lighting that I
have to sort of it's orange color by the
end of this video I really didn't
realize how orange it wasn't so editing
but I wanted it this video up for you so
sorry about that I'm then mixing the
ready brown and the dark brown and I am
putting this in the crease and this will
create a more gradient effect to the eye
I'm just grabbing this lighter shade and
I'm just putting this as the highlight
and this creates a really nice gradient
effect from the darkest out to brow and
then taking this Laura Mercier midnight
blue eyeliner and I wet the brush to
make the color really intense you can
use any sort of maybe I'll on your purse
or eat maybe eyeshadow but you have but
this is the 1i have and it won't happen
to be an eyeliner but I found that it's
actually really really worked and I
think that it would stay on really well
I then took a little bit of black on a
blending brush and I just blended out
some of the corners so was it such a
harsh look now I'm driving that same
color that we used as the base and I am
just putting that everywhere to kind of
lighten up and make sure it's good then
I'm going back in with that midnight
blue and I'm putting it under the eyes
now since the eyes are most done i'm
just going to go in and do my foundation
I'm using the Clinique beyond perfecting
foundation and concealer for this and a
beauty blender and I'm just putting not
all of my face with IP blender just said
that and using the Maybelline instant
age rewind as my under eye
I'm using a bobby brown bronzer for my
contour but if you want to do an extreme
contour I think that would look really
good look as well and you can do cream
but I just can't kind of one awful with
just the powder then i'm taking a black
eyeliner and putting us on my waterline
and my tight line and connecting
everything so it's really dark and
really smoky and then putting this on
top of my lashes as well and this will
create a really smoke dead effect and
wing back with that pencil brush and
smoking everything out that i just did
then I'm taking Dallas by benefit or I
think the heart exposed blush would also
look really good as well this look just
taking the L'Oreal telescopic Carter
black mascara and clean my lashes I
really don't think you need fake
eyelashes for this look but preference
to you and then I'm taking this Smashbox
blue eye shadow and going over it
because it has some sparkle in it and I
really wanted to add that to the look
taking a blending brush and just
blending everything out to make sure
it's just seamless and beautiful and
then i'm taking the laundry lipstick and
we got on i really think hard exposed
lip starting to look really good with
this look as well and that is it i hope
you guys enjoyed this video have a safe
happy new year i love you and thank you
for watching bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
