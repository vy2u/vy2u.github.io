vlogmas day 10 it's 4:30 in the
afternoon and I'm just hanging out -
sorry I am just heading out to film the
videos today I was I went to the
doctor's in the morning and then I added
it and I just basically was like a sleep
all day
so video time
so I just got home from shooting except
I forgot to my lights and it was too
dark to shoot so I didn't shoot and have
to go back tomorrow
yay I got this bro sauce warm a plate
for dinner
I already ate it but well looks and
smells disgusting but tastes decent that
was just starving haven't really eaten
all day it's Saturday night and I'm
staying in it's very rare for me for
delivery not what everyone know that I
didn't eat one vegetable today or fruit
happy vlogmas day 11 it is sunday about
8:30 in the morning why I'm up this
early who I'll never know
kidding I have to get my nails off my
mother stopped to drop the peaches all
my clothes are at this shoot that I was
to do yesterday so I'm wearing this
weird outfit they can't tell if I like
it or I think I would like this outfit
better if I the drop dress with black
and ribbed but it's just as like long
cotton dress with socks and covers
so I I am going to head out and then I
have my shoot at 2:00
my cousin did this painting for my mom
check him out Bobby X done calm
you look at this sit on my face holy
 there's one thing that puts me in a
bad mood it's when there's no parking
it's 9 o'clock in the morning in the
beaches and there's no street parking
like what like where we are these people
and everyone who chills in the beaches
lives here you don't need to drive
anywhere but this needs to go two hours
later
so the color that I got on my nails is
funny bunny I also got it on my toes
it's a good OPI gel color
I stay here
kind of it's very it's right there
pretty over it okay I'm just clearing my
face but that's it for this weekend's
vlog

went out and worked which is like every
weekend so see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
