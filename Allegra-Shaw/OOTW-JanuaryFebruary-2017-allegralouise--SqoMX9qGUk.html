chose to wear this black knit sweater
from
hmm with a gray car coat from forever 21
my pants are from Club Monaco and
they're on sale and then that belt is
just I think she sure is belt Fionna and
then my shoes are from the mutton I just
had a meeting this day and obviously no
one to fill me so I'm in my parking
garage I am wearing a black button down
from Abercrombie and wearing my citizens
of humanity jeans which sadly ripped in
the bum these are the Rockettes
and then I'm wearing my Chelsea boost
from Aldo and my fake acne biker Jackson
Zara
so on Tuesdays we do a lot of uncle
things so today we were shooting and I'm
just wearing one steps before I think on
this channel
laughs Aldo boots some white denim and
then display shirts dressing from
forever 21 and my AllSaints leather
jacket
Wednesdays we do some factory work so
mostly at home during the day hence the
outfit it actually was really cold out
but I was just mostly in my house we
just want to get some lunch so I'm just
wearing my citizens a command-v jeans
I'm wearing my uncle t-shirt these are
our new t-shirts they're so nice and I
just tied it up to make it a little
feminine I guess and then I'm swimming
with a jacket and I'm pretty sure I'm
wearing my band
again I had no one to film three so
excuse this mirror footage I'm just like
running around this day so wearing some
vans I'm wearing my coated black jeans a
tank top my AllSaints
sweater and then my gray forever21 car
coat and then just a hat again I was in
the car mostly so yeah so I thought it
would actually be fun to show you
something that I would wear out on a
Friday and instead of showing my Friday
outfit because I was kind of just like
into sweatpants on Friday so this is
something guys typically wear out at
night this is our oversize uncle t-shirt
a collector t-shirt I have a pair of
fishnets on and then I have my aldo
chelsea boots on and I throw on my Zara
faux shearling jacket and yeah I was
definitely like I've worn this I wore
this the bar so yeah
I totally forgot to film Saturday's
outfit but typically I am in sweatpants
hanging out and doing work so if you
want to see more outfits follow me on
instagram and thanks for watching peace
and love love you all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
