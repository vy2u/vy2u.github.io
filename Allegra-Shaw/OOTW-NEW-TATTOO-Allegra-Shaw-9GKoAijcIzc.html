already I don't know I'm feeling these
jeans a lot lately because like in the
winter I don't want to wear tight jeans
so I like that I like the way they belt
how do you feel with this outfit I think
it's cool and comfy basically wearing
the same thing is yesterday but no
Blazer sweater on top and said this is
Joey's sweater I don't know where it's
from
and then I'm thinking heeled boots so
like this I think I think I'm into it I
think every time I get dressed like I
think I'm into it and then I'm just
gonna wear the gloss a cherry bomb dog I
live really feeling putting a little air
on so right now I'm headed to Soho House
today's vitamin concoction is vitamin D
omegas probiotic digestive enzyme I'm
gonna explore breakfast you're gonna
have the
blueberry one I love gummy vitamins we
rather have a gummy vitamin them I
swallowed wait a min look how dirty my
car is nice this is what Canadian
winters do to your car they're just no
car washes downtown
I see this doesn't rhyme going we just
got a really we just got a really
special delivery a mattress Elysa
mattress I I'm so excited I'm very tired
so my energy levels a little bit low to
keep that in mind but today is an
exciting day because I just got my new
mattress in the mail I'm so excited I
have the same mattress I'm sitting on it
right now yeah my bed I have a same
mattress for seven years since first
year University and University for like
three years so seven years I've had the
same mattress and it's definitely time
for new ones time for a big-girl
mattress I have like a right now I'm
like a mini tiny mattress and then a
memory foam on top and it's just like
I'm ready to have a real person mattress
um
so Lisa is sponsoring this video and
they're collaborating me in this video
and I'm really excited because they are
such a great like there's such a cool
mattress company for every ten notches
that they sell they donate want to a
shelter anything that's such a cool
cause I you know you see that with like
shoes or like Tom's that and you just
see it a lot in like fashion but I've
never seen it done in like furniture
companies so having them donate
mattresses to shelters I think is super
important and really great they also oh
and they've already donated 20 mm
mattresses hello
that's amazing they also do something
really cool they have this whole
sustainability aspect to them and they
plant a tree they plant a tree for every
mattress sold what that's so cool
and they also donate 1% of each
employees time to a local cause which is
just really cool they have basically
three pillars of sustainability and
caring for other people and I just I
think that's a really cool and great
initiative to have for company now where
can you buy these mattresses you can buy
them online but I know a lot of people
obviously want to try out a mattress
before buying and I mean you don't want
to just like buy without
touching it there are two Lisa dream
galleries one in NYC in Soho and one in
Virginia Beach and if you are not in
those areas they have their matches in
eighty West Elm stores nationwide so
check that out if you want to go try it
out pour buying online they are American
made and they are compressed into a
little box which I'll show you delivered
to your door let's do this I'm so ready
to have a new mattress here's the boss
big but not that big and really heavy
carrying this up here was a task so I'm
gonna enlist the help of Joey yeah
Freddie Joyce all for this okay so now
we have Joey so we're putting the
mattress okay so just says unbox so we
carry the mattress where we want to be
put it on its side pull the mattress out
and then position it on the bed
that was really fast it was really fast
smells not bad at all so it says okay so
it says the first says two inches foam
top layer for cooling and readability
that's what I think I get so hot when I
sleep it's disgusting and then we have
two inch memory foam middle layer for
body contouring and pressure release
pressure relief and then we have a
6-inch dense core support foam for
durability and structure for sleepers of
all sizes
so that is the nosh I'm gonna air it out
for big success to uh on the
instructions it says just air it out for
a little bit but so far so good
I just took off all my makeup because
I'm going to an event so he's gonna kill
me he's picking me up soon but I want to
do a quick review on this girlfriend set
I'm sorry I'm sorry about that I'm sorry
about this they're just clothes have to
put away okay so this actually I have to
okay so this is I'm not sure what
they're called but I'll put them on the
screen these are the high waist full
leggings not the 7/8 and an extra small
and then this is this I think I don't
notice call but this razor back bra top
both in extra small girlfriend
collective workout stuff is made out of
like recycled water bottles it's give
the environment their ethic but this is
the color red ochre I'm pretty sure
first things first
I love how highways they are my
bellybutton is super high but it covers
it and I'm into that
top is really nice my boobs have shrunk
quite as quite a bit since going off
birth control so about a cup size I'm
sorry I'm now like a 32b huh sucks but
whatever can you do so this is an extra
small it fits nice there's also room if
you have bigger boobs
now the but this is a problem that I've
had with a lot of pants it's not just
the is that my waist is really small so
I have to get an extra small to fit my
waist but then my butt is kind of big so
this I find drops down here and it kind
of like cuts off my buttocks my buns
like here but this seam
that's the only thing I kind of have
with them overall very into these I'm
now gonna put on the white set that I
got next set this is the white set not
the sand this is the white these are the
7/8 which I prefer 7/8 the pants I am
wearing blue underwear underneath so you
can see you can see the blue underwear a
little bit but with a white you should
be wearing a nude this is the other kind
of bra table and the moment that I got
it I put it on and I had makeup on I got
makeup all over it so that's what's
makeup on in the back of this top I
really like I prefer tops like this I
hate showing cleavage I don't know why I
just I don't like it so I prefer this
covered top again super high-waisted I
got the high waist ones I really really
love how this works what how this looks
is it feasible cuz it's white so the bub
these ones the white I feel like is a
bit tighter kind of Pancakes my butt but
you can kind of see what I'm talking
about with this line no does the same
thing my butt and starts here but the
line is here so it kind of makes my butt
look smaller not something I like I wish
that the seam just was different but
that could just be my body type other
than that I like the way they fit I
think they're really great work up brand
very aesthetically pleasing and I'm into
it
I just just danced like my mom no I just
put foundation on I've been using I got
sent this the Maybelline 24 hour
foundation classic ivory I like it a lot
not gonna lie next Shirin bought me the
Chanel Soleil 10 remember thing and I've
been loving it okay this is what I think
I'm gonna wear I have no idea what kind
of event this is but I'm wearing these
pants that need to be uncreate but don't
really have time for that
then I belted it then I'm wearing a
white turtleneck and I'm wearing this
laser eye we're like every day now
because I really like the shape of it
black boots I don't know I changed just
felt like wearing something different
because I have a lot of photos in that
other blazer and I want it tore this
blazer so right now I'm asking question
because Joey and I couldn't get that
Louboutin item and it's literally sold
out in Canada US and Europe
so I'm asking other just like what
designers people like so I can make an
informed decision about what I'm gonna
purchase before my giveaway
I read for event and look at this
stanley kubrick ceiling we got going on
here
we just write with
come here
have you Wednesday um we had our first
sleep on the mattress it was delightful
really nice so now my old mattress is
packed up I need to go to Joey's house
I'm waiting for Joey to get ready you're
you were doing your hair I think we
solved the problem for yesterday because
we can't find that Louboutin bag and I
did that pole on Instagram again and I
did a Twitter thing and everyone's
saying that the designer that they'd
want to have is Gucci I mean there's
other designers but that was like the
biggest recommend what biggest requests
okay all right so we're at the tattoo
please
we're going to see if ink and water and
see if they have any time for today or
tomorrow tomorrow I'll probably write
more today and yeah we're gonna get a
tattoo it's also very snowy in Toronto
what I was just telling them that the
weather's been different
yes giving them a weather update okay so
they get tickets right now so can you
talk to you right now another one and he
used to
yeah
I'm actually asking for maybe your
opinion they're just trying to get
your job is you nervous
yeah
yeah
yeah it's definitely beneficial to me
okay we just did some work now we're
going to the gym calling in tonight
okay we went to the Gucci that store
this morning and you can't fill him in
the stores so I just didn't find any
reason to take you with me but I got one
bag and I put together a box of uncle
stuff to give away but the giveaway
isn't gonna happen until I reach a
hundred thousand on Instagram so best
way to keep updated with how to enter
the giveaway is to follow me on
instagram subscribe to my youtube videos

to give away two really great prizes for
500k on YouTube and 100k on Instagram
