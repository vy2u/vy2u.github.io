morning routine will be up next week
Mall time and to have to spend money

law on buying for myself whatever

Centre because I want to pick up some
Christmas gifts just having a weird
Monday I know I feel like weird
I think I feel unproductive because when
I'm doing work I have Gilmore Girls on
the vibrant seniority in a TV show it
just makes me feel unproductive no like
this like how can I compete me filming
right now is work so like the monthly
December and actually been more
productive than I've ever been like my
five days in but just feeling productive
because I always have girls also make it
crazy just rolled up Steen Center I'm
not gonna take you with me on my big
camera because I'm eating Christmas
presents and I don't want people to
watch my videos and see whether I got
them
sleigh bells ring kind of a failure I
just got one thing they didn't have the
other things they want so it's going to
order online which means I'm just going
to press my Christmas shopping online

Fridays video
okay so I guess I will get into it what
I was home with this morning so I didn't
really feel like filming yesterday so if
you've been following me for a while I
don't share my relationships on YouTube
even when I had a boyfriend I didn't
really share it on YouTube I haven't
been in a real relationship in like
three years
but when I was I didn't share it so I
don't really share that aspect of my
life
on YouTube it's just a very private and
personal thing for me it hasn't really
been anyone in my life that warrants
being in the video um I think of you
guys as like my children and I'm like a
single mom and I'm not gonna bring
someone onto my channel unless I know
they're gonna be around for a while so
that being said last night I just I kind
of ended something with someone and
that's why I was feeling sort of down
and em feeling sort of down about it
obviously like just sucks
and it's just life but we'll get through
it so um I'm an along here and we kept
tomorrow feeling good refreshed and
ready to do a happy fun vlog</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
