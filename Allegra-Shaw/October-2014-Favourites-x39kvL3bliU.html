doing my October favorites I don't have
that many but thought it was enough to
share so I actually usually don't have
like any favorites but I did buy some
stuff in October oh this is filling so
I'm gonna start with um beauty products
and the first one is the one I have on
my lips right now so red it is the lime
crime lip gloss in red velvet and I
heard some amazing things I always have
a problem with wearing red lipstick
because I like lick my lips a lot and
obviously you guys point that on all the
time then like my lips a lot um and it
usually just like comes off and gets
everywhere so who want the Lime Crime is
gonna focus yes okay whatever
it's all hosting um the line for I love
gloss in red velvet and it's honestly
amazing so it's like a great Matt took a
great matte red color and it really does
stay on especially for lip gloss it
dries matte and stays on a long time
it's pretty expensive but kind of worth
it pretty worth it and then the next
product I bought and have been loving is
the Kat Von D locket tattoo concealer in
light light 18 and I just been loving
this concealer it covers everything
covers my under-eye circles it does get
a little bit cakey under under eyes so I
don't usually render eyes that much but
like I'm really feeling like my under
eyes are really bad I'll put this and
I'll put something over top or the other
way around but it's uh it's a really
nice thick concealer which I've been
loving so I'm breaking out a little bit
which kind of sucks but yeah and then I
got the benefit Dallas benefit Dallas
blush and this stuff is amazing it's
like the prettiest color it's like a
brown kind of dusty rose kind of color
it says for a natural fresh glow like
these sweet this dusty sunset plum
powder across cheekbones and chin and
where you want to look you want looks to
linger avoid eye area so don't that's on
your eyes but I just really like this I
like the rocket or 1/2 which is one of
my roommates has that and I'm just using
all the time and then I went to Wyatt
and I saw this one I was like I think
this one's a lot lighter and I'm wearing
it again today right now beautiful it
looks really nice it like gives you that
warm kind of glow for the winter time
because I are pretty pasty in the winter
and it's kind of gross here so like
having that warm kind of blush to warm
up your face is very nice yeah I don't
like any products and then I bought the
benefit there they're real push-up liner
I heard a lot of great things about this
I'm like I'm pretty bad at liquid liner
so I was like oh I'm gonna try this out
whatever and I do really like it um it
can get a little messy just cuz it's not
a liquid liner it's a gel liner so it
can get a little messy but I do like it
I think it's really expensive so if you
could get a liquid liner that you like
better I mean I feel like they would
it's kind of the same like I don't think
it's anything that especially I think
it's a pretty cool product but they
don't think is like a necessity I will
probably not repurchase this and just go
back to a liquid liner i watch how they
cap on d1 and i want to try to steal one
so I probably just go to liquid liner
but it does stay on and it's very hard
to get off which is nice but I don't
know I'm not like amazed by it but I'm
not unhappy I think it's nice yeah and
then the last thing or no hunchy thing
so I don't know if I shared this in a
video before but I bought the Bioderma
what is it I don't really know what does
it's like a cleanses removes makeup sues
non rinse for free Bioderma
I use it as a toner so I seize it after
I clean my face I put this all over it's
just nice I like well I like the way it
makes my skin feel is $30 anybody got a
pretty big sur dolls in Canada you had a
pretty big bottle and it's lost me like
quite Wahb had this since the summer so
I'm pretty good another product I have
been using is the Dove oxygen moisture
root lift spray
looks like the
and I hope I've used it today and like I
do actually see a difference when I use
it which is kind of unusual for me with
hair products I'm like that doesn't work
doesn't not but this like I spray in
when my hair is wet and I didn't blow
dry it but like usually I blow dry my
hair and like you can feel that you have
like some texture in your hair and like
that your roots there's like you know
some volume in there which I like um so
yeah this Dove oxygen moisture rootless
spray I definitely recommend then I have
some clothing items this scarf
I'm not peanuts yet oh my god this scarf
is amazing um I got it it's like the
knockoff of the Zara scarf they were
selling for a really long time but it's
like you can get on eBay for like $140
now which I was knocked down for so I
bought off Amazon and look at it it's
huge it's like a blanket scarf I don't
look I wear it all the time
I like love it it looks so nice look
around your face looks dude I mean so
music I wear it every day but I bought
for $20 this is r1 would have been 60
ish and on eBay to buy the actual czar
wouldn't be like over $100 so I got on
Amazon knockoff and I love it I love it
it's hot I think I've showed this in the
fingers before but I'm loving this side
I really have doesn't this combo look
amazing together
oh this hots amazing this is from
Topshop I bought it last winter I'm sure
they have something similar Iike bride
hats
Thunder still learn but I've been loving
this hat I'm loving my black leather
jacket I shouldn't let me make the fall
clothes not really pants I find very
hard to like wear pants pants um
Halloween was a favorite for me I loved
Halloween I love Halloween I love
dressing up I put that video up meeting
my friends making my no you couldn't see
a lot and like I know I've got a lot of
slack for putting that up but I just
thought it'd be cool to like kind of
show you I don't know like just glimpse
into my life on Halloween which is me
doing all my friends makeup and then my
favorite TV show of the month I really
haven't been watching any TV show The
Bachelor Canada hilarious
doctor I went to Western just pretty
funny
Basia Canada's like so compared to
the real bachelor and then favorite song
shotgun rider by Tim McGraw just been
like blasting not loving it putting me
in a good mood
and I try to think of what else would be
a favorite no life consists of
schoolwork and sorority events that's it
see I hope you guys had a great October
um and I will see you guys soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
