believe it's vlogging this again I'm
just in the car obviously I'm always in
the car and I'm just heading to a
meeting and just things to do it's gonna
be weird vlog this is gonna be weird
this year for you guys I'm not at school
so things are gonna be really really
different so yeah let's get excited so
much sure I'm gonna do this I am NOT
gonna do everyday like I don't do enough
exciting things in a day to warrant a
vlog but maybe every two day of every
three days like I did last year but
we'll see might just be like really
random I'm thinking of yelling no uterus
no opinion to that man disgusting
we're set Starbucks
having a meeting or Tuesday meetings in
this every Tuesday so I'm just on my way
back from oh my god
from downtown spoon 2:30 got myself a
nice little iced coffee from Tim's
that's good that's good and now I'm
gonna go home I want to put this video
up for you guys it is it get ready with
me and like it kind of sucks cuz okay I
moved back to my parents house and like
I moved back to my parents house and I
just don't really have a space for
myself to film and like I really thought
I'd killed it like while I was filming
I'm like wow this is like great and then
I watched the footage over and I'm like
well you hear Lee see a lot of what I'm
doing and I feel like I just need
someone to teach me what angle the
camera needs to be at to me won't like
to be able to see everything while
you're filming a tutorial like should I
be straight on but if it's straight on
and I look down I feel like I need to be
straight on without a mirror right or
neat because I can use the viewfinder to
like just see what I'm doing feel me
feel me it's hard it's tough life tough
life of a youtuber you know so those are
the dilemmas that I'm gonna deal with I
think I have all my videos planned for
the next couple weeks until the end of
December anyway but know
no as far as awesome suggestions I could
 with a little bit of suggestions I
guess it's maybe like what I think is a
good video to put up might not be I
don't know you know you know the things
I think about also how long do you want
these vlogs to be because like I feel
like no one really wants to watch like a
half an hour blog plus I'm not gonna get
that much footage in each day but maybe
like five minutes I think I feel like
that's like a good I'm out of time max
five minutes cuz somebody's I'll
probably have two minutes or like three
minutes I don't know what do you guys
like because I can't watch videos that
are longer than like 15 minutes like
that is maximum for me so let me know
what you guys think is a good time
amount for the blogs so I have some work
to do so I've I'm just gonna be like at
home on my computer so I thought I'd try
this Stella
Greyson Stella Co luxurious foot peeling
mask and I saw this in another youtubers
video but they got there's like oaf
Amazon so I was sent these and I'm gonna
try them out cuz I feel pretty rough
into karate for like so many years so
yeah okay let's do this so it's sighs
you have to wash your feet and then you
put these on so that's what I'm gonna do
oh that's gross
these things are those little star
things are epic though if you have hair
because it just catches the hair but I
don't think that excess I'm good gross
so I just washed my feet and now I'm
gonna put these on I'm gonna try to set
my camera so you can
you just rip it it also said there's
okay so the boot looks like this and I'm
gonna put the first one that I'll show
you the second one
oh god this is scary okay so there's
tape oh it smells like like tequila it
actually smells like tequila I'm not
kidding I lied I found the tape so I'm
gonna use that okay so that's how they
look I'm just gonna put socks on and
chill for now oh my god all over my
 bed okay time to take these off
so you definitely have to like sit down
and now I'm just gonna rinse my feets
and I'm soaked them Oh what is that
Oh God freaking out just switch sweaters
