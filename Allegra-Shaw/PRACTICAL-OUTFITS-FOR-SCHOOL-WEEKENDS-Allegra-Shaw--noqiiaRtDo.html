for school for like the fall and winter
time I know that now that I'm out of
school so my outfits can just be like a
little too much for you or you need
something else a bit warmer so I decided
to make this video because I know that
when I was in university putting on
jeans was like an accomplishment so this
video is in collaboration with roots and
they are sponsoring this video and it's
specifically to do with their packable
jacket it's like a fold-down jock gets
really warm but the great thing about it
is you can just pack it up and it turns
into this like little pod so you can
just throw it in your bag I hated
wearing a jacket in school I was always
so hot so the back you can roll it up
put it in this bag and then put that bag
in your backpack is amazing and then you
still have like your bangin outfit
underneath roots is also giving away a
fifteen hundred dollar gift card
shopping spree so if you want to learn
how to enter back contest all the
details to be in the description I think
that's it hope you guys enjoyed this
video let me know what you think and let
me know if you like the office so in
this first outfit I am doing that
layering jacket thing that I like to do
I'm layering my leather jacket
underneath the roots packable jacket the
long one I really like the look of layer
jackets I think it is just it looks
really cool and different and it's also
really versatile if you get cold you
have two jackets on if you get hot you
can take one of them off so underneath
the jackets I'm just wearing a really
light sweater I paired it with faded
black jeans a belt and some boots to
give this really cool casual and easy to
wear vibe this open is really different
for me but I'm really into it so layered
sweaters I have a turtleneck layered
under another sweater with some
high-waisted mom jeans and Gucci slides
paired with the backpack I think this is
perfect for school keeps you warm
because you are wearing two sweaters
feel free to add a jacket to this that
would also look good but I just think
this looks really like
school school time
this outfit is for when you want to look
just a little more put together but you
still want to be really comfortable and
warm this skirt is like a sweater
material skirt stretchy really comfy you
paired it with a sweater again really
comfy a warm and then I'm wearing the
pack whole jacket on top just in case
you need that jacket to go to school and
then you can just pack it up like I am
here it turns into this little capsule
thing and then you can just easily throw
that in your bag which I really love is
I hated wearing a jacket during school
I've heard this outfit with sneakers but
it looks really really good with black
chelsea boots as well something fun
about speckled rock is you can actually
trace each individual jacket to see like
where it came from the origin and it's
all ethical down so you don't worry
about that but I would just include that
in the video because it's pretty
interesting this outfit is definitely
something that I used to wear to
university all the time it's just a
t-shirt leather leggings and boots
paired with the short packable jacket on
top just makes it really easy and
comfortable
I have mittens on because who doesn't
love mittens and then here I just threw
sweater on top of the tee so depending
on your climate you can definitely just
do a vintage sweater on top of the
vintage tee and it's warm its cozy but
it still looks really cool and edgy
this outfit is for when you're running
late for class and you're like oh my god
I will complain I have to at school so I
just paired these sweatpants which are a
skinny sweat pant with an oversized TV
neck tee and a leather jacket with just
white running shoes and a backpack and
you're like good to go this is so
comfortable basically pajamas but you
still look put together even though
you're wearing sweatpants
so this last outfit is very similar to
the first outfit but I'm wearing a denim
jacket underneath and then I have a gray
sweater underneath that I have faded
jeans and I have boots but this really
keeps you equipped for all weather types
if it's raining this jacket is fully
waterproof and warm but you can take it
off if you get too hot and the jacket is
just really good quality so if you're
looking for a jacket like this this is a
great option to check out other than
that thank you guys so much for watching
I really appreciate it and I hope you
like these practical office thanks for
watching peace and love love you all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
