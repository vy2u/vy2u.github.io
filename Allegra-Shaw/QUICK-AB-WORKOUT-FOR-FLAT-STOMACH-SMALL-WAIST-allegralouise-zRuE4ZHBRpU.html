Abbas video so it starts video making
sent me some of their products that a
big fan of Nike forever
and specifically these sports bras so
that is really going in and like
revamping the sports bras and creating
sports bras to fit every single woman
who wants to do athletics definitely one
of the most vital pieces in your
wardrobe and your workout clothes I've
been wearing like the worst course bra
ever and the difference between what I
used to wear and this is like crazy I
wore this to work out in you'll see in
the video and like this to support in a
comfort that this gives me other than
like a cheap sports bra that is it
really made for me the difference is
just crazy and I didn't actually think
that I would have like feel a difference
I do a small dude so obviously my
problems aren't as big as someone who
has large boobs
breasts but no one should feel like in
pain or they know what you feel as if
like they can't do something cuz they're
boosters you big or they're boobs aren't
supportive car police buses these
browser for they have so many different
styles for every single boob size bra
type rib size everything you'll
definitely find brought for you and they
have a lot of different levels of like
performance so this is a lightweight
performance one but they have other
levels as well if you're doing something
that's super intense and you have bigger
chest you want to like keep it keep the
girls tight so they have for a new
abroad coming out this one is the indie
bra and also comes in other sizes and
first so it comes in other styles this
is the gray and black one it has a nice
little cross back so that was sort of
sweet as well or that's my chair so it's
definitely like a style a color for you
and I go with those really cute color
combinations and if you want to check
out these bras and you live in the GTA
area there's a vent happening at
Yorkdale called the Nike bra hop event
from the 27th to the 30th west and this
week you can go check it out as you can
check out these new bras and
yeah I love it this is a McGraw you'll
be able to see in this video how much
support I get from this one we've been
jumping jacks and doing the cardio
aspect to this workout the binamis are
in place which I like yeah no matter
what your side no matter what sport or
athletic activity you're doing they'll
definitely a bra for you so higher I'm
gonna go check that out because I'm in
love for a girl I love it
it's just like it's so flattering to and
there's like little cups in it to hide
the nips show like anyways so let's get
into this workout this is my party 1/2
day welcome to my gym so I'm just going
upstairs to drop my stuff off and this
whole outfit is Nike and it'll be linked
down below
obsessed these leggings and that shirt
actually super slimming that shirt but
for cardio I usually take my shirt off
because my body is literally a furnace
and I'm hot all the time so I want to be
able to sweat but not be overheating so
for cardio I will walk on an incline at
15 incline 3.2 speed and I'll do this
for half an hour on a cardio day on a
non cardi idea do it for about 10
minutes 12 or 15 minutes come on cardio
half an hour 45 minutes and that's the
sports bra it's so cute and supportive
and then I'll also switch up my walk so
I'll do like a lunge walks really focus
on the glutes make it a bit harder for
myself make it more fun for myself also
while I'm doing cardio fun fact I
usually watch youtube videos so we're
not on my youtube video watching time in
then I will grab a weight or like a yoga
block and I'll go upstairs and I will do
jumping jacks or some sort of cardio
like this so jumping jacks I really like
and I'll do a hundred of them I think
they're really hard you can also add
weight to this if you want but I really
like jumping jacks this is my sport
check water bottle and that's what the
events at and I will take a sip of water
always drinking water for my workout the
first workout I do is a 90 degree angle
sit-up and your abs should be doing all
the crunching your abs should be
bringing your body up there shouldn't be
any movement in your neck or anything
like that
this exercise is one my favorites leg
lifts
I think they're really hard I keep my
hands behind my neck just because I find
it
harder but you can keep your hands down
on the floor as well I like to add that
little lifts at the end because it feels
like I'm incorporating two exercises
into one here you can see keep your
hands down like this as well but this is
hard works my abs I love it this has
been a longtime favorite of mine so you
just hold a weight or a yoga block in
between your elbow and your knee and you
pump your other leg I think this is a
really hard workout works your abs just
a great exercise overall the next
exercise I do our mountain climbers is
like a staple and everyone's ab routine
you can start off like this and go
really easy just lifting your legs up
and then as you get better you can start
actually like running keep your box flat
your odds engaged there I am again doing
the easier version and then I'll go into
the harder version but I've really I've
incorporated these into my workout and I
really really like them this exercise is
called the bird dog and this really
works your transverse abdominal muscles
this is just your opposite leg to your
opposite arm and you switch back and
forth and it's really working your abs
below your abs if you know what I mean
remember to keep your back straight and
your abs engage in this exercise my back
looks a little bit curved which means
like abs weren't as engaged as they
should be but this exercise is called
the Russian twist and great exercise
pre-standard exercise I had a 2.5 pound
weight you can use something heavier or
lighter if you want you can just use
your hands the next exercise is called a
stomach vacuum and I do these to make my
waist line appear smaller they're really
important to work your transverse
abdominal muscles which are little
stomach muscles under your like big abs
and they are super important for your
lower back and just keeping your body
like upright and just really good for
you so what you do is I lie on my back I
put my hands like all my hips are on the
ground I exhale
all of the air out of my lungs
completely I expand my chest and I suck
in and bring in my stomach as much as
possible and then I hold it I tried to
visualize my bellybutton touching my
back bone
and then I do that over and over again
please consult a personal trainer or
someone of that nature before trying any
of these exercises after I would do my
workout I would roll out stretch out and
then I would leave the gym and be happy
that I am done working out for the day I
hope you guys enjoyed this video thank
you guys so much for watching I love you
all peace um uh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
