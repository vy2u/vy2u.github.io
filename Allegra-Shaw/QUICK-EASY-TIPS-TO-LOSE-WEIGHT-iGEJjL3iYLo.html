today I'm going to do a video called
quick and easy ways to lose weight these
teams will definitely help you lose
weight but they're more for just like
having a healthy and more balanced
lifestyle so don't be fooled by the
title titles right but it's obviously
like the most dramatic form of the video
you would be thinking like what if I
ever wanted to lose weight or anything
like that but last summer I treated my
body like absolute garbage drives out
every night I was always looking over I
gained about 10 pounds
nothing big of a deal but and a lot of
the thing a lot of people could notice
but I definitely noticed some when I
look to be ready to feel my best so I
needed to make my lifestyle healthier
and better and take care of myself so
that I would feel better so these are
the things I did to lose that weight and
it worked really well for me so number
one is a drink of hot lemon water in the
morning I have said this many times but
this is a perfect way to start your day
kickstart your kick starts your
metabolism so just cut up some lemon
squeeze it in add some hot water and let
it all soak and drink that in the
morning before you eaten anything
that's perfect way to kickstart your
metabolism / - is kind of just
surrounding drinks so do not put milk
and sugar in your coffee especially for
having coffee throughout the day this is
where I think it killed me last year I
would have liked a venti iced coffee
with soy milk and sweetener in it and I
had that all the time and it just is so
bad for you just sugar and sweetener if
you're gonna have coffee especially
throughout the day have it black because
black coffee is the best for you and
might be like oh it's so gross but I
swear you will enjoy it the ventually I
hated coffee I didn't drink coffee for
ever and then for three University I was
like you know I'm gonna start reading
coffee I put milk and sugar in it and
then I eventually just was like this is
so bad for you drink a block last summer
I wanted to treat myself already
apparently so I had milk coffee milk and
sugar in my coffee everyday or soy milk
but take out the milk and sweetener
because it's just like
added stuff in your drink that is just
bad for you you're just you're just
drinking sugar you're not drinking
coffee you know what it means so if you
take that out and you just have black
coffee I swear you will feel and look
and then throughout the day avoid sugary
drinks obviously don't drink your
calories it's like a term so don't drink
pop just drink lemon water just water so
number three is get at least ten minutes
of good physical exercise day I know
everyone can't hit the gym every day I
can't hit the gym every day so I get at
least three good amazing workouts in
when I'm at the gym and I'm sweating I
feel good it's three to five depending
on the week but I three max or three
minimum so the other day is just get
those 10 minutes in so go for a walk get
outside just do something even if it's
like 50 jumping jacks or something like
that just get your heart pumping and
moving at least 10 minutes a day and you
know yeah it'll work I swear number four
two things is try to reduce your
smacking or eat healthier snacks eat
slowly so if you eat really fast which
honestly I'm a super fast eater it's
insane if you eat really fast your body
doesn't have time to like process and
adjust and tell you you're full so eat
if you eat more slowly your body you
know one bite you chew it you digest it
and then your body you can kind of
determine how full you are so eating
slowly is better for you and you will
probably eat less because your body will
be like hey pulldown you don't date you
are you know I mean number five is
something new and this video isn't
sponsored but I thought this was perfect
a day additive to this video I don't
crave sweet a lot but my best friend
Shirin creates tweet all the time and
she tried this out yesterday and it
worked for her so two people can now say
hey it worked for them but it is crave
crush so what crazy crush is they stop
these to me mouth Walter though create
the crunch basically if you're having a
sugar craving you eat one of these and
your sugar craving will go away it like
binds to the taste but receptors in your
mouth I don't know it's like it isn't a
mint basically but I usually have one of
these like after a meal because they
like you know if I feel like oh yeah I
want dessert or something like that I'll
take one of these and
creeping will go away they also said
that you can have one of these and then
try to eat it sweet and you won't be
able to taste it so it's a really good
option for people who can't really are
having hard time controlling your
cravings towards sweet I definitely
suggest you to check out crave crush I
think it's very beneficial again this
