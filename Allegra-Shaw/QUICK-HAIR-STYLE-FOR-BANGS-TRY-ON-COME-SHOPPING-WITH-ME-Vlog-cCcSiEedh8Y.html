we are off to eat your fill every time I
have login warning Yorkville every
single time you know go there I know we
don't go very often with every time I
log we are going on a little shopping
spree with Holt Renfrew they invited me
to see their new women's what is it what
is it
women's like concept store kind of thing
and then we're going to drop off this
Briscoe capsules it's so little I know
but it's so cute that you guys big bags
that size
the contemporary smile
damn this new actors are sick are these
our scarves they have New York yeah
on the garden you need it it's your
nickel I know
okay this first outfit is from redone I
also just realized that put this new
highlight on and it like really doesn't
look good okay I have a pair of these
jeans similar but they don't feel like
this these are redone these have like a
nice stretch in them I really like the
make your butt look really nice
0:24 but how many pairs of white washing
so I need probably not another pair then
this top is buy them too this is an acne
Studios hoodie and this has a key right
here I really like the fit of this see
ya out the back it like goes out if you
think it's really different then I can
also tuck it in to jeans you know what I
mean see if I can get you a little bit
brighter here I think this was really
really nice this is a Zimmermann dress
I'm wearing black underwear so don't
mine but I love the shape of this dress
I actually really want to make an uncle
dress in this shape I think it's so
pretty I feel like this is the perfect
length for it was down in the back
because down in the back and up in the
front what do you guys think of this
dress
I love it I love it I really like the
shoulder frills though wow this is crazy
beneath this I used to do was just so
cool right it's just like $465 and how
often am I gonna wear this but damn so
this is my outfit today yeah just
button-down leather jacket
these are Lomonaco pretty old and then
my real classics
say thank you okay so we're up in
espresso store it's right there and we
are
recycled capsules that's how much coffee
you drink so I just got back from the
Nespresso store I want to have a little
chat I just made a coffee
I am partnering with Nespresso on this
video in on a few other videos
throughout the air so I'm very excited
about this and I hope you are too
because I think it's just such an
organic and natural fit this is my job
and I want a partner with brands who I
love and care about and who love me and
care about me and kind of our values are
just super aligned that my content
doesn't have to like stray away from
what it normally is to partner with the
brands they partner with I think a lot
of the misconceptions when it comes to
single-use coffee is that it's bad for
the environment and this is not bad for
the environment so this is a virtue of
an espresso capsule deserve the bigger
ones and these are made out of aluminum
an aluminum has a lot of benefits we're
number one it's fully recyclable it also
really protects the quality and the
freshness of coffee
they're fully sealed so all they have to
do really is they just have the the
capsule and then this little thing and
then it goes into this cardboard box and
that's it there's no extra packaging I
think a lot of the times when companies
coffee companies especially say that you
know they're environmentally friendly
but to keep their coffee really secured
and fresh they need to have like a ton
of plastic and everything really like
sealing up the coffee this is you know
what that cardboard box is a fully
recyclable and then the aluminum is
recyclable as well I am a single person
living alone so it's a huge waste of
literally everything for me to make a
full pot of coffee
this makes the single coffee for me and
I'm good to go as you saw I went to the
Nespresso store and I recycled my
capsules I keep a basket like this
underneath my little Nespresso machine
and then I collect all the capsules
whenever that's full I go to them in
this Restless store and then I recycle
my capsules and espresso has recycling
partners that are environmentally
friendly recycling partners and those
recycling partners actually helped
Nespresso give second life to the
aluminum and as well as the leftover
coffee there you go everything's being
used again sustainable that was one of
the reasons I actually did partner with
this resto is their commitment to the
environment I found it really
and really inspiring a day it has been
let me tell you we just got I had to go
to the manufacturers the manufacturer
couldn't make half the stuff because his
machines weren't fitted for the type of
fabric we wanted to use but we got one
sample back and I'm wearing it right now
I've been wearing it for a while to see
how it fits and how it if it stretches
out but I'm gonna give you a sneak peek
he wanted to make a basic sort of summer
dress
don't mind the mess so we came up with
this it is just a spaghetti strap or
like tank top strap ribbed dress it's
form-fitting but has a lot of give it's
super comfy not see-through because I'm
wearing black full butt underwear right
now it's pretty long
it's like mid than five six just below
the knee on me and I'm really loving it
so so far so good we might end up making
this this isn't white make it in a few
different colors I hope you guys are
excited about our new sort of like
silhouettes still basics still easy to
wear but just something a little bit
different
oh my god so cool
just were to like appreciate something
when you have 20 seconds
they don't know was it like this in LA
now it's a really flexible thing
okay so we just left the room
we just left like the first top of the
exhibit it's it's good I feel like it's
really hard to appreciate I mean I
really like art I feel like it's hard to
appreciate our we have a twenty second
time was there a 20 second time Lloyd
wherever this wherever else this thing
that it was I'd love to know because
it's like hard to to be there in the
moment
kind of herded like cattle through the
exhibit or I like to like really take my
time we're in the sticker room so you
place the stickers
I'm st. Patrick's Day it's a few days
later from when I last vlog but I want
to end off this vlog um okay so this is
my hair it's kind of dry not fully dry
but it's getting there
this is just my natural hair was a
product in it I have curly wavy s hair
okay so my bangs are pretty long but
they kind of are annoying like I mean
right now they look pretty good
but st. Patrick's Day and I want my hair
out of my face so the hair is probably
doing laws I just take my front bangs
and I pulled them back like that and
then I take a bobby pin
open it up put the bobby pin around like
this and then I stick it through
frontwards the bobby pin is the opening
of the bobby pin is like facing this way
and then it kind of creases like messy
back to so I take the bobby pin again
clamp it around the whole section of
hair and then push it through to the
front so I take the finger and put on
the back and then push it through like
that and then I leave my hair like this
that's like the hairs all I've been
doing every day to get my bangs out of
my face they're not annoying and then
tomorrow I will show you how I do my
little bun if I'm not super hung over I
will do it but that would be the end of
this logs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
