video like two hours ago and then I got
so sidetracked by the sea babe you don't
you injury but today I am going to film
a his like opposite end of party again
Steve Aoki I'm Nippon Box cool makeup
look for you guys because it is the end
of August and school has started and or
is starting for you soon so I'm gonna do
really simple easy back to school makeup
look pretty eyes that's good for like
you know school they're actually feature
name is vanity planet makeup brushes
which are cruelty and they are sorry
cruelty free and they are vegan which is
sweet
they're super soft it comes with a whole
set here so you would only get every
single type of brush that you need to
apply your makeup very inexpensive and
if used the code glow kit at checkout
you can get 70% off so everything will
leave a link down below obviously you
can check it out but I mean somebody
person off this amazing brush set and I
know a lot of you have been asking about
brushes so I think this is a really
great set it also comes in this little
case thing and just light folds right up
and you continue traveling to your
wherever let me keep them all together
Julian so the case is actually made from
lychee fruit shells making it faux
leather which is cool and use the
brushes a few times since some of this
video and I thought they were really
high quality they didn't shed easily
wash and they're actually three of
allergens which I thought was epic so
let's just get rid unto the best makeup
okay so I am first brushes it first I'm
trying to use lower end products but
there's a few that I just don't have so
I'm using a tinted moisturizer I really
like this one this Laura Mercier one but
there's tons of tinted moisturizers at
the drugstore the Garnier one is really
good I think so yeah and I'm gonna apply
this with
this brush here I really like these
handles they're really nice I like to
put the product like all my things and
then buff it out that's what I like to
do so just like a really light layer
oh you still don't even like wear makeup
to school unless I had like presentation
or my skin was really bad which like you
know knowing me what's a lot of the time
so I'm just buffing this in spreading it
out and then pressing it into the skin
as well and like this is very sheer
coverage which i think is great for
school looks like who wants to pack on
all the makeup for school especially
when you're like how long all day it's
so gross so like literally just gives
like a sheer sort of glow to the face
but I do have a few zits
so I'm taking this Rimmel concealer in
light I literally I bought that NARS
radiant creamy concealer which I love
but it run it ran out so fast it was
insane then I'm gonna take this like
tiny little brush here takes a product
I'm gonna put it where I eat it I'm just
placing the product with this
then I want obviously the under eyes
feel a little bit brighter some tuning
the Knicks
cancion assistant cwo2 so it's like very
light but I wanted to make the under
eyes pretty bright because I'm pretty
tired today if you can't tell and then
I'm gonna do that same brush because we
just wanna you know move along and get
this done because you don't a lot of
time in the mornings
I'm just buff that out these brushes are
so soft it's so nice and then I'm gonna
take a kabuki brush and I'm gonna take
this Rimmel lasting powder foundation
I've been using this a lot actually they
like this and this is in the shade a
light honey it's gonna take this on my
cookie brush and I'm gonna put this all
over the face this will give extra
coverage and it'll just make everything
last longer
yeah do you would have had it up since
you know a lot of time in the morning
you just kind of you know go through
this pretty fast everything's a little
modified nice got a nice coverage but
not too much coverage you know I don't
have a low-end concealer or bronzer so
I'm using the hoola bronzer this is you
can get this at drugstores I mean you
can today huh
so I'm gonna take this angled brush and
this bronzer it's expensive but I feel
like it lost like a really long time so
it's kind of worth it and I'm just gonna
you know put it where you put bronzer so
just you know we're here bronze you up
the face my forehead
and then I'm gonna take it under and
down my neck to just you know blend
everything out
if you're wearing your hair up just like
make sure you get that problems you're
like right in the hairline I just like
to make sure my super blend it out and
then we're just keep it really simple so
I'm going to go in with this Rimmel
blush in lift pink I love this blush
they go with the same brush so easy
bronzer on cuz I really like that sort
of look I'm just like really easy you
just want like you know power through
this makeup so you can like eat and get
at the door I think I've said that like
five times so I'm just buffing this into
my apples and then up sees a nice glow
as well generally like excuse a nice
flush blush to the face sunkissed like
hey I've been inside all summer right
and then literally like this is good for
me like I would go to school like this
but we're gonna finish it off with some
highlights and I I'm gonna use is I'm
gonna use a fluffy brush to put this
highlight on I kind of find it with this
highlight if you put it directly on with
this brush it gets like really uh like
it doesn't blend out right so you want
to take like a brush like this not a lot
of product and buff it into where you
want it
see see and I think this is like this is
hi beaten by benefit by the way I've had
this product for so long like this
product elastic rubber cuz you literally
don't need that much at all and I think
this gives like the most natural looking
highlight ever you can also use the moon
or sun beam or moon beam I love those
ones as well I actually love all these
products and then I'm gonna take a
little bit ya know many of those
anywhere they just want that glow and
since it's like not a sparkle it's like
a sheen it looks so good
you put so many forehead if you wanna
leftovers I like that look and then what
I would do is take that kabuki brush so
has just knocked our powder and just go
over it I gotta tone it down maybe with
natural but I don't know I think it
looks really like natural and pretty so
I've been loving that and then I'm going
to take my I'm gonna take my L'Oreal
telescopic mascara and just a light coat
I don't think you need you over the top
for school I just want to make sure they
look like you have eyelashes you know
you can even use the benefit primer I
really like that stuff for like a more
natural look and then I'm gonna put some
on the bottom I think as well just like
that and then I'm taking the covergirl
sugar Oh sugar in one cupcake
mmm so good
not that this look is from your school
like you shouldn't have looks super done
not at school you should just look like
yourself I'm just like with your skin
you know feeling confident but looking
like you so I hope you guys enjoyed this
makeup look for me to check out those of
vegan makeup brushes if you're into it
and that's all I to say thank you so
much for watching everyone has a great
back-to-school sort of energies a little
down in this video I'm so tired but uh
