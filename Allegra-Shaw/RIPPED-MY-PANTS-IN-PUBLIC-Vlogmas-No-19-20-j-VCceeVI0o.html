sixteen has brought like so many great
things why am I wearing this bag like
this 2016 has brought so many great
things to the world like I think we're
moving in a good direction but like it's
also made people think that they're
entitled to have an opinion in
everyone's life and they have Judd like
I don't like that everyone has is in
everyone else's business and think that
their opinion matters in their business
