I want to apologize if this is super
echo yeah I'm in my bathroom and I don't
have a mic um but isn't the shower this
morning and I was doing my full shower
routine and I was like I'm wanna do a
video on this I really like watching
shower routines and I've never done one
before so it's new so I'm gonna show you
all the products that I use in the
shower and I was gonna show you like
clips of me like shaving my leg and I'm
like why would I do that
that's just like it's just so pointless
I'm gonna give you my shower routine I
shower every day I don't wet my hair
everyday really depends on how that my
hair is looking and I wash my hair twice
a week I wash it Monday morning sorry
Monday nights and Friday mornings
obviously washing her hair everyday is
not good for your hair so I don't
recommend you do that and I'm just gonna
tell you the color I'm wearing on my
lips right now is this NYX lingerie me
amore but I'm gonna be giving away a
full mix set of lipstick soon so stay
tuned for that so the day is that so
right now I'm gonna show you what I do
on like a full shower day hair washing
everything like that the first thing I
do when again the shower is I wash my
hair so I have been trying that this
product it is a pre shampoo rinse
sorry it's a rinse out pre shampoo so
it's from Kerastase and basically it's
like an exfoliator for your scalp I only
use this once a week and it's I don't
know how I feel about it yet I don't
know how well it works but basically
because I don't wash my hair that often
I really like to like exploit my scalp
and get all that product off my skull
especially if you're using dry shampoo
so they using it for that I'm not sure
I've seen a difference but I do like it
I like that stuff and I only so I only
use this once a week then I go into
shampoo and I have two shampoos they
switch off between I have the renewing
argan oil of Morocco Morocco shampoo I
just really like the smell of this one
it smells nice and leave my hair feeling
really clean so I like that and you
switch up my shampoo every time so I
have bought this one twice so I do
actually really like this one but I
should really just wash up my shampoo
and then the other shampoo I've been
using is
Kerastase one looks like this and I've
been really liking this as well the
smell is like okay I don't love this
smell but it's like okay but I like the
shampoo as well both of them don't leave
my hair feeling dry or anything I
thought then I go into conditioner so my
conditioner I usually use like a
conditioner mask I have two of them that
I use so I like the macadamia natural
oil deep repair mask looks like this you
can buy this at the drugstore and I've
been using this one on and off for years
and then just love love love the smell
of it and it's thick and it's
moisturizing it's hydrating it's just I
feel like it really like nourishes my
hair so I love that and then I also have
the matching one kara smells like sent
me a package that's why I'm using this
stuff but I have the Kerastase one and
I'm pretty sure something maybe uses
Kerastase on her hair so she was
beautiful hair this is a similar sort of
mask so I leave these on my hair for the
full time that I'm doing my body stuff
oh throw the conditioner on and then I
also have a wet brush so I usually brush
through my hair with when the
conditioner is on and and then I believe
the conditioner to sit there while I
wash my body I'm just gonna show you one
more hair thing
so also once a week I use the Kevin
Murphy blonde angel color enhancing
treatment for blonde hair I'm pretty
sure this is like technically like a
conditioner but I like to use a
conditioner as well I don't think that
this is good enough to use just in the
conditioner so I will do this either
depending on the day usually do this
before I conditioner my hair while I'm
gonna shoo my hair after it really
depends on the shower I can either mix
it in with my actual conditioner but
basically it's a super dark I don't want
to get this on myself
usually when so you can see that it's
like really dark purple usually I feel
like when you buy any like drugstore
purple shampoo or purple conditioner
it's like a super light color and I just
feel like they don't do anything I can
fully see a difference in my blonde
after I
tonette with this so what a purple
shampoo does if you don't know you have
blonde hair and your hair starts to get
like brassy or orange or more warm tone
and you want to color correct that warm
tone to a more neutral tone or a more
cool tone the hair color use a purple
treatment so I love this one my hair
stylist
Anita well my hair colorist Anita I love
her she recommended me the shampoo and
she has like really cool toned blonde
hair so it really works I can see a
difference after the use which I
appreciate a lot so while that's sitting
in my hair I have my body products right
now I'm just using this Olay body it was
on sale this old label wash it smells
nice smells like a classic Olay product
I'm not really like I usually just buy
whatever's on sale and whatever seems
like hydrating and moisturizing if you
guys have any body washes that you love
let me know but I used this to shave my
legs I use this to wash my body and this
is just kind of all over like a body
wash for me and then I also want like
special days when I have like an
occasion or I want to smell pretty when
I'm going out at night or stuff I use
the glossy body here at the beginning is
that I don't really like the smell that
much but it's really grown on me and I
like that it's more of an oil so it
keeps your skin super hydrated so that
and I have the matching lotion over
there so that's like a more of a night
out sort of thing for me I for
exfoliators this is the Explorium easy I
think I showed this in a vlog but it
used
I like body shop exfoliator so this is
the French grapeseed scrub smells good
it's like green and it's a good
exfoliator so I I've been liking this
one and then I also if I have sorry it's
wet because I use it this morning but I
like the loving kisses so disgusting I
like the loving tan exfoliating mitt for
getting off fake tan it works really
really well just be done 20 or scam
because it can be kind of harsh for
shaving I got to use it in chick for a
long time so I had a partnership with
them I have gone back to using Dollar
Shave Club it's just like when you have
to pay for razors it's
just the best deal so dollar I don't
know if you know Dollar Shave Club now
you sign up and you can get you get
raise your headset to you I get my razor
head sense me every two months you can
get every month and you pick a handle
and you get the blades for it every
month so I have the middle one this is
the seven dollar handle you can get this
is not sponsored by the way but although
I'd love to be sponsored by Dollar Shave
Club there's a three dollar handle a
seven dollar handle and a nine dollar
handle so that's what you pay every
month so I pay seven dollars every two
months and get four razerheadz I love
Dollar Shave Club nothing bad to say
about it because like I'm not going to
the drugstore and spending thirty
dollars on raise your heads
no thank you lifesaver money saver
Dollar Shave Club link down below if you
want to check that and then the face
wash that I keep in the shower is the
Kiehl's Helen doula flower extract for
normal to oily skin type thanks wash I
like this it's a nice face wash its
gentle does the job but if I'm going in
the shower at night I do a pre cleanse
balm to get all my makeup off and then I
wash my face then I would wash all the
stuff out of my hair and I would get out
of the shower and I would moisturize my
body moisturizing my body after the
showers like so so key to me my mom
taught me to do this when I was a child
so I moisturize my skin heavily
moisturize my skin after every shower
it's just super key to having healthy
glowy skin and then I go into my hair
routine eye makeup machine and I you
know do hot stuff so that is my shower
routine I hope you guys liked it too
