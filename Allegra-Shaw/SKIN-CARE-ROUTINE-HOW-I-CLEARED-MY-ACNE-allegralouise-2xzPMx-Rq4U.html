skincare routine it just hopped out the
shower parent silhouette and no makeup
on I felt like it was perfect times she
was giving her jeans you can really take
a look at my skin and how it has changed
I'm using a lot of new products which
what I want to do an update skincare
routine
I first want to talk about my skin and
the journey it has been on so I used to
have a really bad skin all of my acne
was mentioned and I had cystic acne when
the acne is on your chin it's mostly
hormonal so they tell you it's hormonal
and not saying and like there's not
really much you can do but it was home
birth control I didn't know what to do I
struggled with it for years he was just
so frustrating because I felt like I was
doing everything right but the people
who just still always top up how I
cleared my acne was cutting out dairy
and you'll pretty much anymore
really cheese I don't eat dairy anymore
and I don't get cystic acne anymore I
think a lot of people overlook food when
they're talking about me they're like oh
it's your hormones which it totally
could be but or two hormones are words
for products using your you don't wash
your makeup off it could totally be food
it could be an allergic reaction to food
or food isn't do as type of food isn't
to all of you and your body just rest
when swears up my skin was a big factor
in dairy else about summer has better
problems
so dairy me just do not get along and
there is a huge factor in cystic acne
and a lot of people so really look
inside of your struggle mr. Abney so I
kind of dairy and then it's both all
wood okay
and then I was kind of lessons to not be
starring well what kind of look ahead
I'll be showing you may not we all see
it in this video because the lights but
mostly that feature is right here and I
am still trying to get rid of it and
doing a bunch of things to get rid of it
so what I want to do is just walk you
through everything that I do
this isn't idea it'll do all of these
steps every day really depends the day
home feeling good feeling cleansers I
haven't downloaded that I like so in
love with that I want to keep using it
so I used to enough I guess that's a lot
of product you guys know so I used to
switch it up but
one that I'm using right now so I've
been using this Bioderma no parabens
hypoallergenic purifying cleansing
foaming gel looks like this I almost
done I keep this one of my showers my
shower cleanser I really like it it's
gentle it doesn't permit kids and have
my program or anything just a nice
gentle cleanser and they're like Iowa
derma so I started using this one I keep
up I think and this is the Ella 100
cleansing foam from CN tree it's a
Korean skincare brand and I got this in
my noon moon fall new bag
and which is like a subscription for
this isn't sponsored are just telling
break all this six subscription for
Korean skin here and only now both one
check it out but they send me a bang a
help like all these Korean skincare
products in it so this is just a really
nice I haven't only uses a few times so
I can't really the test it's working for
me or anything it's a good cleanser I
like it to take a moment take off my
makeup I have been using the derma e
vitamin cleansing water and now I like
it thanks I like German eat they're good
like has a cool natural skincare brand
now I see my face I usually will wipe
off my makeup with this or the viola
turbo like closing water sort of thing
or make of white depending on how lazy I
am mega voice I just ran out of mine I
was using the Garnier ones I think just
whatever is usually sent to me I used
but cleansing water or something and I
just rub it on my eyes or makeup and
then I wash my face you guys are going
to die and how much danger I have sighs
you face the skincare here that I'm
going to go through so embarrassing I'll
obsessed with skincare
I just want my skin to be those people
you know basically how like a little bit
of freckle and whisky first so later I
use the amore Pacific treatment enzyme
peel is actually a powder
exfoliator so you like put it on top of
your hands the perfect amount comes out
and then you just rub it off I like it
no complaints I've been using it for a
while if you're looking for a toner item
I kind of feel that owners aren't
necessary anymore because a lot of
cleansers are pH balance and
I just feel like you don't really need
it and I thought it was unnecessary
stuff I used to use the lineage powered
essential skin toner I do like it I just
don't really use it anymore so if your
self I don't know I haven't been using a
lot of serums the ones that I have been
using is declares pure vitamin C I
really like this and think it's helping
with acne scarring for sure I was using
the lamented bright Renu originals here
for a while not a big fan of it actually
just might throw it over and I don't
know I just do a little X but I've
really been liking the pure vitamin C
and then that's it for like serums
themselves moisturizers so my ice cream
right now is the Innisfree work at eye
cream I bought this on Amazon Korean
skincare brands heard some great things
about it so I think about that I really
have been liking it it's not too thick
or anything but I feel like it like just
works really well he was day and night
and then in the day of using the bio
firm aqua soros ever complexes smells
really clean it's really lightweight
moisturizer but still gives you a lot of
moisture and then at night I've been
using the biotherm aqua source ever pump
tonight Mimi is because I was fed them
and I want kind of month I ended up
really like now this is really cool
though it's black like it looks Carolee
see but like it's a black moisturizer
it's really a little watery texture but
I really have been liking this and then
sometimes when I go out at night I wash
my face and then reapply makeup so I'll
offer safe I'll put a moisturizer on and
then reapply mate makeup I'm going to do
that I use the gland glow little cosmic
matte little moisturizer so this is like
my moisturize that I use like in the
middle of the day smells very sweet and
it gives you like a nice matte glow so
I've been liking that for like middle of
did have so much to hear I don't even
know how to organize this video for oil
so I put natural oils on my face to get
rid of acne strong girl she's really
good for your face when it comes we went
off to my moisturizer I don't do it all
the time but I do do it quite often oil
I really like our jojoba oil
I heard so it's just 10% pure organic
moisturizing oil for skin hair bonyen
multi-purpose so you can what do we just
put this anywhere but it's just like
super nourishing has a lot of great
properties in it that can get rid of
acne scarring so I love that you don't
need that much so it was like four
dollars then I think it 100% pure bruh
style skin care castor oil this is a
skin softener and it's multi-purpose
this is really great for like hair
growth apparently my best friend ripped
off someone back to Arizona Zollman
ripped off half my brow she's dissing
her eyebrows for but she said thicker
and mysuru so we can put still your
eyelashes and all that but I like this I
put this on my skin in my eyelashes
roasted boils and the chocolate is
before I put this on the area that I
want to get rid of acne scarring and it
is proven to work and then I have the
Renee rule o post breakout shaving gel
this works well too but I do like the
natural products better if I do have any
this system if I use the Renee rule oh
and he says treatment this is amazing
like if you get sista got me this is
amazing it works so well you see a
difference overnight I sometimes get
cystic aathi still like right on my
pocket for my hair so I know it's really
gross but I'll just get like one and
miss it's gone within two days which is
amazing so I highly recommend the in
cyst treatment from ruining rule oh I
bought it off their website but I'm sure
you can buy all my own stuff too and
then if I feel like my skin is just kind
of like I've been wearing a lot of
makeup and hiding those like small discs
I use the proactive pour targeting
solution and I just put it all over my
face
I don't notice things here that I
haven't tried yet so I'm going to talk
about masks now I love masks I just I
love them so I have a few different ones
and the favorite so into the origins
clear improvement active charcoal not
too clear for so I only use this when I
feel like I'm getting I'm having a
breakout or I think it is pretty drying
it's not a map that you should use
everyday at all it's only really for
when you're having breakout such as to
clear out your pores so I like this for
that my favorite favorite Maithili
the woman asked for as it should help
with acne scarring because it has some
colloidal oatmeal system along the lines
of like this is the old amount that has
some like active open people or
something but this is the first aid
beauty ultra Repair instant oatmeal mask
and you went over ten minutes I
pronounced about ten to fifteen say for
sensitive skin it's really nice it just
just looks like oatmeal I put it on your
boat people you want oatmeal on your
face but I really love this I think it
it if you look like calming your skin
down so I just I really like the way
they feel after so this one I just got
and I have been really really loving and
it is for again not sort of like you
want to like clear out your skin I've
got means if it's the glam glow of
superbug clearing treatment has a very
strong like licorice a scent and when
you put on your face you can definitely
feel it like tingling like it almost
burns
I only leave it on perfect ten minutes I
only use this a few times but I have
been really liking it it was your skin
feeling really soft and clear so this is
what I think will replace my origins one
although this one is more expensive so I
think you could get you onto important
one and it would really make a
difference she masks are like all the
rage right now they're just super easy
I'm not messy great for travel so I like
to use these on planes and stuff but I
do just use them like on a day-to-day as
well so these are the Tony moly masks I
have a ton of them there's like
plasticity brightening in purifying skin
soothing radiant like there's literally
one for everything I don't know which
one I like the best
I'm not sure I can see like a huge
difference between them but I'm sure
other are differences by how much to use
whatever I'm feeling if I'm feeling dry
anyone I'm feeling Dulli radius 1 so I
like these the next class I just got and
started using and I'm obsessed I really
really like them they're gonna peerless
prevent blue Louis and seaweed treatment
sheet mask intensely moisturizing
student balancing didn't look like this
how live a few from here you help you
bees one for like 15 20 minutes of one
over twenty minutes and I did sold it
less my skin feeling really hydrated and
bright and nice is very calming
I think after 20 minutes so it's
starting to like kind of it I feel
irritated I just like wanted to get off
my face yeah I really like these and
then before I was using the violet or
aqua plum which I feel like is already
sitting up on its own and very hydrating
I was using the drops of music bouncy
sleep mask and it's like a bouncy sort
of thing and I would just use out the
normalizer I don't use this as much
anymore but I do really like it and it's
pretty expensive and then that's it the
next things I have I'm going to try out
are the during the e radiant face glow I
hope of Argan and sea buckthorn oil the
Sun fish elbow ones during the E and the
during ear renewing moisturizer just
because I was into derma e I like what
they stand for
so I'm gonna try something after so if
you've tried these let me know that's
the ones in here I know a lot of
products like you but I do have a ton of
products I really like to take care of
my skin
remember drink a lot of water get and
have sleep those are the most important
things for your skin remember take off
your makeup before bed I never never go
to sleep with makeup on my face I used
to do it in high school
sometimes in university and it just
grosses me out now I cannot do it I have
to walk with you even if I'm like so
drunk and it's 5:00 in the morning
I hate my makeup off may avoid whatever
just take it off it's so bad it's so
persecutes all of your pillow you sister
where does he go makeup single on the
water get enough sleep and hopefully
