little weird oh I'm gonna see it again
okay I might look a little weird because
I just I literally just got a spray tan
like an hour ago and like I didn't have
I don't have time between now and
tomorrow before I leave to film this
video so you're just going to deal with
spray tan me
it's pray to him before I wash it off so
my chest looks a little weird right now
kind of gross but I'll try to filter it
out anyway hi
it's my spring haul I'm very excited I
have so much stuff that I'm almost a
little embarrassed I went a little nuts
I have to stop shopping forever like I
don't need anything else maybe I need
another pair no no I don't need anything
so this really should be like a
spring/summer haul because I don't
deserve anything else and I'm really
excited to show you the clips that I
filmed for the triumph or shimmer film
before my spray tan so you're gonna see
two different skin tone versions of
myself so is my nose red I've been
sneezing a lot I'm a little sick so
let's just get into it shut up like
right okay the first thing that I've
been loving is a yellow I just run
really into it I've always loved yellow
I don't know if I was filming videos and
only those four wing videos my room is
you know I think my room is green when I
started filming YouTube videos but my
parents however my parents house with
her old parents my parents old house
rest in peace while I sing rest in peace
the house a bit died like they just
moved my I paint my room a lot when I
was little like I'm always I my little
I'm in grade 9 but I've always loved
yellow and I'm just back on the yellow
trend that's all I was trying to say and
this has gotten out of hand so I have
all my clothes over here and we're just
gonna go for it the first thing I picked
up which I just worked with first time
last night it's just a little too cool
to wear them right now but I got these
yellow fans I've been eyeing them since
I think I saw I like Haley Baldwin
wearing them like two years ago and I
just wanted them but I never got them
and now I got them so this toe is like
sweetie and then this is canvas and
they're just yellow bands and I'm just
loving them I think they're gonna look
super cute in the summer like jean
shorts white shirt mom jeans everything
like they're just so cute and but
I wear a lot of like white converse so I
think they all should be like a nice
touch the only thing I got is this mini
fuel Robin y'all robbing kenkon I fucked
that up I know and I got this backpack
and I now that I think about it I want
to get it another color too I want to
get it in like the burnt orange kind of
color or like rip color because I can't
wear like Yale backpack in yellow shoes
though it's just like too much so yeah
it's really cute it's actually a holes
way more than I expected I can fit like
an iPad in here and a bunch of stuff
I've used it a few times and I've been
loving it I'm gonna use that's my travel
on for Miami tomorrow my travel on my
carry-on next I'm gonna start off with
uncle just cuz we have a few new things
and I want to show you first mine don't
have drawstring but we finally added
pants to our uncle collection and I'm
really excited about it they're joggers
it's our first kind of like step into
pants so it's really cool it's like a
really exciting time for us and I'm
obsessed these dongers so they are a
waffle knit jogger I made at a waffle
material and going into it I knew I
wanted to make like a slim jogger that
both men and women could wear so men can
definitely fit into the larger sizes the
medium to large and the extra-large Joey
can like kind of fit into a medium but
he fits into a large and shreds
boyfriend fits into an extra large so
they did larger to larger sizes
definitely fit men this we've kind of
made it like to be able to fit everyone
depending on how you like your joggers
to fit that's the whole point of one
goal everyone can wear it these are the
natural color and I just want to be
clear natural color means undyed so it's
untreated fabric if you like converse
the canvas color is called natural
because that's untreated undyed fabric
these are extra small the size I'm
wearing the videos and extra small and
these they fit me really well I like the
extra small and going into it I really
wanted to make sure that they didn't
stretch out a ton the ankles don't
stretch out at all which is like a huge
problem that I've had with joggers is
the ankle stretching out I hate that so
the ankles don't stretch out at all and
the joggers don't really stretch out
that much
no like gross saggy bum and all that
that color and then we also obviously
have them in black as well this is a
size small I'm wearing in the clip
and these fit me as well but I just
preferred the extra small size we also
added a nice black lightweight summer
hoodie I've heard your cries and you
guys wanted black hoodies back so we put
black hoodies back up on the website
this is the Gloria hoodie it has a small
little uncle logo here with a little
crack through it's really cute and small
and delicate the back has like a faded
angel and that says died for somebody's
sins but not mine and I'm really I
really like this hoodie it's a perfect
summer hoodie because it is lightweight
and it can take you kind of through
spring into summer into fall and even in
winter but it's a nice like really
comfortable lightweight hoodie and if
you have the white hoodie that we put
out a while ago it's the same hoodie
just a lot obviously everything this
video will be linked into the down bar
next I'll do Reformation and I don't
know hon I got this dress how much does
it show you this I got this dress like a
long time ago and I got it on a really
really crazy sale like it was very
inexpensive for how much this is
normally this dress is normally 428
dollars and I bought it for like 120 I
think I think it was one crazy sale I
don't think they have this exact pattern
anymore but they always have this type
of dress you're gonna have to see it on
because yeah it's really hard to show
but the pattern is beautiful it's like
this beautiful floral white and floral
pattern it is really long for me I wish
I got at hemmed I just I honestly didn't
try it on until this clip and I bought
it about two months ago so um I I really
do love this dress think it's like a
perfect summer dress I just need to get
it hemmed the next dress I got from
Reformation which I was actually secured
was gonna fit but turns out it did looks
really short but it I think it looks
cute on it's just this like pretty girly
floral little dress I think I'm gonna
wear this to Miami a lot um I mean I'm
not usually like a no bra type of person
boobs are really I'm gonna wearing it
but all right now though but like boobs
are really small and like I don't know I
like the feeling of a bra that's just me
I don't know I know like a lot of hate
bras but I just like them they keep my
boobs nice and you know secure but I you
can wear a strapless bra with this I
guess and
a really pretty little summer dress I
think this was pretty expensive
$218 but I really like this material
there was another address that I wanted
the Reformation was on waitlist for so
long and I was just like I saw this one
in this material I'm like this is q2 oh
I have a more thing from Reformation I
like I died for Reformation I love it I
love everything about it
next thing you're a pair of jeans they
are I had an Instagram picture in them
they are just like a light wash Flair
crop style Jean the only problem is
they're not super cropped on me so what
I'm thinking about doing is just
cropping off like cutting off this hem
and just making them across flared Jean
haven't decided yet but I got them in a
24 and the 24 may ssin fits me pretty
well I probably could go down on 23 but
I feel like they'd just be like super
super tight and I'm really into that for
these but I love the color I love the
denim worn them a few times they haven't
stretched out that much so good pair of
denim okay let's do our bonel fitters
two things about three things Road
Outfitters but one of them just like
hasn't arrived yet
Urban Outfitters obviously drop ships
and things just come for wherever but in
a while first thing I got is this
striped tee everyone has been asking you
about this tee and it's like my favorite
right now I just love this stripe thing
I guess I feel in like turned 25 and I
want to be a child again I feel like I'm
dressing got a young but it's summer
like I'm going into summer I just want
to be comfy and free so this is by the
brand truly madly deeply and I actually
got this in a size large because I
didn't want to be like cropped and tight
I wanted to be a bit oversized and like
tuck it into jeans so I got it in a
large and I love that
well that's he the next thing I got I
don't know had I think I might return
that I'm not sure it's a lot of color in
my wardrobe lately but they are these
pink cords and I thought they're gonna
be cropped flare but they're not but
they're super super flared and I wasn't
I didn't really want that I want them to
be like more straight like but they're
very high waisted they make the butt
look very nice
these are by the brand rolla's Australia
got them in a size 24 I think I said
that I think I want to look into role as
Australian just cuz it made my butt look
so so nice
that's it from Urban Outfitters from her
ball they did send me this item and I
think you've probably seen it on my
Instagram already but girlfriend denim
these are the girlfriend Caroline
Karolina
Karolina jeans with rips in them they're
just a nice ripped Jean I don't have any
ripped jeans so I added some more like
washed jeans to my wardrobe Joey was
like do you need another pair like wash
jeans and I was like yes I do thank you
uh afraid bottom I got them in a 24 they
fit me really well
and they're just a nice comfy I think
they're me like the perfect summer Jean
because I can just like threw them on at
the cottage just bumming around you know
I love it
those are former golf girlfriend done
next thing is everywhere you guys know I
love everlean another good ethical brand
you saw me stylist my spring outfits
video it is just like a bag it's just a
tank top dress light blue kind of like a
midi dress kind of wear it like no bra
free if it also belts it if you wanted
but you can wear a bra with it as well
it's just that beautiful like pale blue
color that's gonna be really in this
spring and I think it's just a really
easy spring summer dress the next thing
is a white button-down shirt and I I
just needed a really good-quality white
button-down shirt and I don't have one
and I feel like I need one like when I
go to meetings I need to have just like
a white button-down shirt so I got this
one it looks really nice it's a thick
material so I can wear like a black bra
underneath if I wanted to and structured
wear trousers blazer anything like that
and I just needed a white button-down
shirt because I'm half child half adults
huh
I'm getting through this quickly and
pretty proud of myself the next thing I
got is a blue button-down shirt from
every lane but it is short sleeve oh I
got the white button-down shirt and zero
I think zero but I got this one in a two
because it was on really big sale and
that's all I got left so it's short
sleeved and then really boxy and it has
these slits on the side and
I think it just looks like super hip
they have like a silkier version of this
this is more structured material but I
think it just looks looks really hip
with like jeans and whatever trials or
it's like there's just so many ways you
can wear this a super versatile
I also styled that my spring outfits
video saw a lot of these pieces of my
spring outfits video if you want to see
that it's one of the changing videos
your favorites I did order something off
of Zara for my main Miami trip it's just
a straw bag and I just wanted some
things or one of like cool parties and
stuff i one thing i didn't like care
about too much and it has this like
chain detail with a scarf and yeah and
then I also got this pair of heeled
sandals from Miami and they have like a
stretchy material here and then they're
plastic here I wanted just a nice like
nude heeled sandal to wear to dinner or
anything that I needed so yeah and the
last thing I came up with Howard here
got so fast I'm very proud of myself
last thing I got is abating suits and
this is from iris swim and they're just
like two separate pieces so first I got
high-waisted black bottoms and I have
these in white if you saw my bathing
suit video last year should I make a
bathing suit video this year I'm not
sure if I have new bathing suits they
did um yeah I just high waisted I have
these in ribbed white and I think
they're really flattering and since I
have a spray tan I'm not too concerned
about like tanning so I think it'd be
really cute and then I kind of I kind of
made a mistake I really thought that
this t-shirt was gonna be like bathing
suit material and it's just a normal
t-shirt like I literally just could have
taken an uncle tee and done this but I'm
not gonna return accents probably and it
costs more money to return so it is just
a normal t-shirt but it just ties in the
front and it's actually kind of too big
for me like a lot of the Meyer tops feel
like they should make an extra small for
a small baby lemon because small doesn't
fit my small boobs I want to wear the
the this tee with these bottoms that's
like a bathing suit that was like the
plan but it's just like an old tee it's
kind of see-through so not sure how it's
gonna look like you can see in the video
how it looks but I I'm like kind of
pissed that I thought it was bathing
suit material it's not it's normal
t-shirt material it was very expensive
okay I just powered through that hall in
20 minutes I'm pretty proud of myself
for at 17 18 minutes right now so yeah
