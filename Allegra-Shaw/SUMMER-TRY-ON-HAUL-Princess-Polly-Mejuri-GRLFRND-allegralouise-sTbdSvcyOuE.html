weird intro I was trying to get my bun
I'm wearing the bun I was trying to get
it in the video but just wasn't working
out for anyone yeah I'm going to do a
haul for you
um it Wilson take this watch off because
I don't think it goes with what I'm
rocking right now dad you'll haul free
too ah I have some things I'd love to
have some things that I was given and I
was gonna call to pick a summer hauls
and I realize a lot of these clothes are
very summery
I wasn't handed a summer's about a month
long two months long the weather hasn't
been very great here so I kind of got
things for the summer but also for just
like all year round at first point start
off with princess Polly me birth
together before and we are going to work
together on this video as well they said
well I think there's a bunch of items
and it happened to me and they also gave
me a discount code for you guys which is
Allegra 20 yeah so if you put in a line
for 20 I check it at 20% off which is
epic because I love shopping with
discount codes basically like the only
way a shawl okay so the first thing our
glasses will just get to done the way
these are the key hall-of-fame
sunglasses myself they were really cool
black sunglass there's like mesh sort of
mesh I don't know what it is um but I'd
be really cool different and it's that I
haven't worn this yet but I thought it
would be as good Beach sort of like I
don't know like going to the beach you
could wear this because it's still like
a dress and it's not like hey I'm one of
the beach so this is called the loose
grip mesh and it's the dress and it's
just a black a mesh dress it doesn't
look see-through but it is pretty
see-through but I think I like a black
key under this for the cobalt would look
really chic going to the beach so I love
that oh yeah it's a try and haul so
triangles are for you
the next thing I got are these pants and
wear them already
I wore a lot my friends the size of
Sagada like this is so cute I wanna
trade
No so I did the seas are the really
can't remember the name of your camp but
I will have everything we down below
like usual but they're like a
high-waisted pleated leather looking
pants I really like them they're super
flattering I got a size six in these
pants and they fit perfectly my only
thing is I don't really like I thought I
was going to really like complete but I
actually wish that I got something that
was more flat I know they have these
pants and have a flat front so I would
have probably go on nose but he don't
look bad and they make me look like I
have I guess bigger hips of it but I'm
just not used to wearing pants like this
but they fit beautifully and actually a
lot of compliments on them when I wore
them out the next thing are another pair
of pants and I wore these in an
Instagram I just want to check that out
I worked with our answers crop from
uncle which was going to be in this
video but I feel like you've seen it so
many times and the end result Mobile is
black and has a white stripe in these
pans were perfect because these are
blocked and have a white stripe and it
just went so perfectly together it's
such a chic outfit these are the I think
tough girl pants and welcome to size
eight because that's all they had left
and they do fit me they're just like a
looser pants they have a split seam at
the bottom which I think this slip seam
trend where is it here this lip seam
trend is going to be a huge trend so I
love these they're really these are
really on trend and yeah you could get a
size if you're by side the side victory
it was both fit you should give them
more like a cool kind of not so tight
pant the next day I bought which is a
very summery item finally is the strong
I think it's called the wings of silver
romper but I got in the side 6 I could
have also got this in a size 8 but this
does fit me as well if you're taller
than me though you should definitely
decide because this would be way too
short on you classics so this is really
pretty silvery romper again just a good
like called a speech piece you can just
throw on
it has no sleeves and it's really pretty
they have us in a few other colors too
I really like the orange color the next
thing is this shirt a thing called the
David Bowie shirt our Bowie girl crop
same sort of thing
they got this an extra small or a size
six probably could have gotten this in a
size 8 I feel like I'm very
interchangeable between the two sizes
but it's just like silvery black shirt
and has these what seems please against
what seeing huge trend um and I really
like this I haven't worn this yet just
been a little bit too hot or things we
really pretty in the fall related with
black high-waisted jeans that also
looked good with like a leg wash Milan
Jean the next thing I should have gotten
into six and I actually meant to get it
is Navy but I was getting it in this
more taupey color I think I would get
more wear out of the Navy but this is
not bad this is a shirt so it's just
like a strapless ruffled shirt um I
think this one looks really good with
the tan it actually is going to what I'm
wearing right now white pants mom jeans
black it would be nice it's not really
my style and I feel like I can style it
to make it more my style
the I definitely should have bought it
in an extra small because it's a little
loose at the top but it's I don't know I
feel as if I got our small would be
shorter and I like the length so I could
probably get it taken in the next thing
is a belt and if you watched you watch
like my videos and if you watch every
video is or you see my Instagram rank
blog post I got a belt some princes
Polly and I wear it all the time so I
bought the smaller belt that was the one
I have already have is that like a lot
bigger buckle it's exact same like the
buckles really big so I just want to get
a smaller one and I've been wearing this
one a ton it's perfect everyday belt
I love annexing very summery piece as
well this is just a little white tie up
top with some gold gold lines in it cold
stripes and all
and this I thought would just be perfect
for the cottage pair of shorts tie it up
with the beading soudanese can and be
such a cute top you can also wear this
with a white bra like going out or
something if you wanted to but I just
really got it for the cottage and then
the next thing I got which I just did a
blog post on so if you want to see this
style check out my blog is this shirt
right here I also post it on Instagram
it's like a loti shirt with like these
sorters going very big sleeve it gives
it those really low-cut and it ties in
the front it also has a little clip here
so your boots stand which is nice I was
milk bronze the black black high-waisted
jeans it looks really nice so you can
check my blog post from Instagram for
that and I will have tried not in this
video so that's how I got into the poly
if you like any of those items
everything will be linked down below and
you can put a leg row of 20 at checkout
and get torn off runner the next thing I
manage of jewelry I also did a blog for
me is just whom I figured it would be
very difficult for me to show you these
in the video where they're so dainty so
the first thing they're all from
Missouri which is a toronto-based
jewelry company it's a really nice
jewelry company they really commit to
cross your ship and at the whole
practices which I'm all about as you
guys know and I think of a few pieces so
this one is just a silver baby necklace
with an A on it you get any letter that
you want but I've been wearing this
every day and I just think it's super
tasty and pretty and I got these the set
of silver ring so I have this one little
diamonds in it just a plain silver
soccer ring two black diamonds and a
twisted ring I have a full blog post if
you want to see them in detail because I
know you can't really see them close up
and then I also got a gold stalker ring
to go with all my gold jewelry and then
this is like this oh I just tangled it
shit okay well I just tangled this so
don't do that but this is just a small
little dainty gold necklace with the
diamonds on it and I think this will
look super pretty for summer
we need a pan will looks really nice I
mean silver looks nice too but I think
that this one is more of an everyday
where's this one I could wear it's like
a wedding or something and it would just
be really pretty
I just tangled this shit out of it
though so I have to put this away I'm
gonna sing one more so definitely check
out Missouri all the links are down
below the blog posts link down below
really cool toronto-based company and I
love supporting trauma based companies
so the next is my last ever order from
forever 21 I'll never be ordering from
them again there's a lot of resurgence
their company and this was known about
it long ago about life anymore not very
quality and I just can't stand by their
practices so I'm just going to show you
quickly what I got but this is my last
hour or so for any 20 mark my words hold
me down to this I got just a straight
across body suit you can find these
anywhere this one is very good quality
to tell a lot of good stretch in it
which I kind of look for I know that our
um I have a body suit that has a lot of
like stretch and it's really good
straight across net and where that month
one of my videos before and then I got
just cropped hoodies they're like a
rinsed material I got it gray and I got
it in black they're just cropped hoodies
and I wore them in my Instagram you want
to see them here's the black one like
that I like them because they can go
jeans and you can like throw a crop top
on and still be covered up so that's
good I got this really ugly orange rain
jacket but I was wearing it a stretch
and I worked an event and I really liked
it I also posted it on Instagram um I
think I thought it was really cool kind
of like a novelty piece I got this
pajama side it comes with these little
shorts and then it comes with this shirt
I got ice cream on this shirt of a kid's
birthday party
but I really got it just for the shirt
because I wanted like a pajama shirt to
wear with black jeans and stuff Nick
couldn't find one so I just got an
actual pajama shirt but like really bad
quality feels not
doesn't look too expensive Marley into
it but it was yeah whatever
laughter freshmen I picked up these
white boots from misguided I was looking
around everywhere for white suits
couldn't find this anywhere but I feel
like these during a huge trend so I want
to pick with heresy if I wore them in
like the member they never quality pair
but they're really comfortable for
misguided shoes and they were on sale so
they're like super soft so I'll link
those down below my new babies these
babies oh I love them so these are the
girlfriend denim Natalia Jean they are
black I really like the light wash ones
though - I'm thinking that guys knows
well the bottom is a split seen bottom
it has this I got them besides 24 and I
am a 24 in citizens and I'm 25 and
Topshop that helps you with your sizing
but he fit me perfectly they did a
little snuggly versus one with a do
stretch Oh
and I'm subsidies I love love love these
jeans I'm thinking about buying more
girlfriend denim because I have seven to
them and then I'd also swimsuit I'm
actually wearing the top to it now it's
like it actually shirt in a cane I got
high-waisted bottoms from Myra swim I
did not going to try this on because I'm
going to be doing a hold the key video
soon so Myra swim I did get hit with
crazy duties for this swimsuit so keep
in mind if you're going to order for
Myra swim ip's like $80 and duties and
it really hurt my soul and then the last
thing is these studies these are from
Kendall and Kylie and how fast are these
I am obsessed them I think they're so
cool they were like $200 are pretty
expensive for something novelty but I
get so much wear out of them I love them
