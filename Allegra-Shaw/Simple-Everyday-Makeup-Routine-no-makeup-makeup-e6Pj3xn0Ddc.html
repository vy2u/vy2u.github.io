my everyday makeup routine we were
shooting some photos and we had like
half an hour so I thought I would do the
maker teen in the studio because it's a
beautiful aesthetic way better than my
apartment okay excuse the noise there's
a major road out there okay so lately
I've been using the Smashbox photo
finish primer and moisturizer I don't
know I don't have an opinion on this yet
it's nice but I don't know I'm also
wearing like body bronzer right now
because I don't have a spray tan on but
I'm getting one and like this makeup
routines definitely when I have a spray
tan all my these fronts really dark so
if I seem streaky it's cuz I did it with
a paper towel on my body for face
products um a couple things I got this
juice Beauty step seller CC cream it's
really nice really lightweight like that
doesn't really provide a lot of coverage
so it's really nice for those days where
like you really don't want to wear
makeup I also got this Sunday Riley the
influencer I think this is really new
and I got this in a really dark color
because I was really tan when I was in
California so I got it in a 220 and then
I also wishes this is like a lighter
color this is the maybelline superstay
full coverage so what I've been doing
this is super dark so I've been mixing
these together so I actually don't have
an opinion on this yet because I've only
been really mixing these two together
but this will be really great this
summer I think let's do that and then I
got this venti beauty sponge which is
like a Beauty Blender but it's like
sixteen bucks so I'm just taking a
little dab of the Sunday Riley and then
that it would be may believe I also got
this it cosmetics brush that I like a
lot but we're gonna use this little
beauty blender
looks a little dark but we can fix that
and I don't use that much product I want
to keep it kind of natural but I do have
some stuff to conceal obviously it's
like acne scarring which is really just
a light sort of base over the whole
thing to just even out the skin tone to
make it mesh next I've been using the
Tarte shaped tape this is in medium
light medium and under the eyes
concealing kind of been using it for
everything don't have too much to
conceal just a little scarring classic
and then I'm just going to adapt that in
under the eyes at the other side of the
ad wonder or fenty what is it
okay that should be good hopefully you
can see but it's a nice nice texture
nice color doesn't look too makeup II
which I like um powder I ran out of my
glossy router so I went back to my Laura
Mercier translucent powder but it's a
fave and I'm just gonna put this in some
spots that I want to set mostly the chin
any like my lips a lot so I always get
this like a ring around my lips of like
pasty white skin showing through and
then I do have the Laura Mercier
brightening Creek brightening powder for
under the eyes but honestly on a day to
day I'm pretty lazy so I just end up
using this powder as well I always have
to do my eyelids because they crease
like crazy so outside bronzer I have
really really really been loving the
hoola light for the day I got these
little sample packs came like a huge set
like hey with a bunch of blushes so this
is the hoola light and I actually really
really
I really really like the color of it I
like the way it looks on the skin and if
you're not super tanned it's such I
think it's like a way better option than
the darker hula because that can be a
little intense if you're really pale I
have like a bit of a tan
well like my foundations found darkest I
put that tanning so fun but this is
definitely like what I use during the
day now because I definitely looking for
a more natural look I need everyone to
shut the up so I'm not really
looking to contour that much or anything
but just give it a little bit of like
slight definition to face I can't talk
with the truck in the background just
yeah and then if I wanted to just make a
more chiseled look I would add a bit of
this hoola but again very lazy oh also
great product like if I was eating the
Juice Beauty kind of thing I would use
the glossy a stretch concealer to get
like a really natural look but I think
I'm gonna do the more natural look in
the summer time for you guys it's more
of a summertime vibe for blushes I've
been using - I've been using the benefit
dandelion blush and the benefit
California blush two very different
vibes this is a really Coralie tone and
this is a baby pink both really pretty
just depending on what you want I'm
gonna go with the Coralie tone today
maybe maybe I'll do baby pink let's try
it use a stippling brush for this
because it's the one that's just in my
makeup bag right now
that's a baby pink looks like it's very
very natural it's gonna have been a core
least on top or California I'm not
corrilesa
California I find that like peachy Coral
II blushes definitely makes you look
more like glowy and tan the glossy a
cloud paint in beam makes you look
beautiful and blowy and that's a good
one but I've been feeling the powder
blushes
I'm gonna have a breakdown like Plouffe
is done this is the this is just a
shitty instant Matt setting spray it's
from essence I got in the pr package I
was amusing it it's not the best I
definitely like the Urban Decay all
nighter setting spray and I like the
skin dan avi1 she's really nice but this
one was in a PR package and I just want
to use it don't waste product glossy a
halo scope is like one of my favorite
daytime highlighters super easy to apply
don't be precise about it and this is
like a makeup look like you can
literally do in five minutes if you're
not talking to a camera the last time I
go to five minute maker Chino it was
like this is like 10 minutes long well
that's what happens when you have to
explain everything to camera all the
time
so something just like really natural
for brows I don't do my brows but
sometimes I'm having a crazy broad a law
see a boy brow but I usually just brush
them out with a spooly boy brows nice so
it's just a clear one I don't really
need to add anything to my brows because
they're very thick so it depends on how
they're feeling that day mascara I back
to my L'Oreal telescopic mascara I love
this mascara I think it's just gives
your lashes the best like wispy long
look which is always what I'm going for
I don't really go for volume I usually
just go for length length what happened
they're usually just go for light this
is a very heavy mirror lately I have not
only been putting mascara on the bottom
looks like a tiny bit oh what's going on
they like to washes on the side that are
just very long like this always happens
gonna film makeup it's like one year at
lash lashes or like something is so
severely wrong okay the lips is kind of
like where I've been having more fun
with the makeup I have a few products
here on a day-to-day I'll just go with
something really natural like like
glossy cake which is just a very natural
kind of like brown color it's just
something you can like quickly reapply
throughout the day I love this color
this lure charlotte charlotte tilbury
fresh rose lip gloss is really nice like
out on top
just gives like a really pretty fresh
vibe this one you guys were asking it
this is the NARS hot-blooded no wait no
yeah nah Rose power matte lip pigment
and hot-blooded I'm gonna put the
Instagram I'm gonna put the Instagram
where I would wearing this is really
pretty like peachy color and then these
Sun bum lip tints are really nice as
well like a coral and a peach or a coral
in a paint I guess I could put some of
this one wrote too but these some
balloons are nice because they're SPF
SPF and them so you wear the beach or
that the pool and they're just like an
easy kind of lip balm and then this is
definitely more of like a lipstick I
wear this more when I like how I want to
look actually presenting nice that's it
that's my everyday makeup routine we're

could probably was done in like 10
minutes if you really power through it
