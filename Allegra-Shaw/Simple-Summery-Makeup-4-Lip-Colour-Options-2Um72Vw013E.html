look it was requested for my Holy Grail
products video that's this is the makeup
that I was wearing in that video this
was not the lip colors remit me oh but I
do show you the lip color I actually
show you four different lip options that
you can wear with this look because it's
just so simple and like an easy summer
look I give you a nude lip option and
orange lip option a pink which is right
here and then a red so if you want to
continue if you want to learn how to do
this so you can just keep watching
I just said don't film this video and
they decided to drill right side of my
door so a lot of you requested the
makeup look that I was wearing in my
Holy Grail products video so I'm gonna
do that for you today and then I'm also
actually going to show you two different
lip combinations that I think look
really good at this look because the
next day where the see make up with a
different lip combo and I thought it
looked really good so I'm gonna show
that to you it's really really simple
but yeah let's get into it cuz I'm
taking the L'Oreal True Match in the
color w3 nude beige and I don't have any
paper towel
it's um it's gonna dot this all over my
face I try to match my foundation twice
to my skin to my neck not really my blog
like I don't like when your face looks
like the same color as your body just my
personal preference I like when your
face like a little bit lighter so it
seems a little more natural so okay so
and then I just gonna take a damp Beauty
Blender and one this out you might need
some more product
beeban there is a little bit for wet
that I want it to be but one day many of
you tried the Clinique it's like a dark
spot eraser kind of thing it's like a
serum if you tried it I'm taking $94
which is really expensive that's all I'm
on see if anyone's used it and had good
reviews because I'm trying to get rid of
some acne scarring right here so it's
blending this out my teeth
my and it seems like basically the same
color but like not like it's not the
same color as like my chest do you mean
I just I like it just like 1/2 feet
Leonard then my body because I like to
want bronzer okay next we're gonna
conceal I forgot to put primer spray on
so we remember it should do that I
remember to put face primer on
I just forgot I always forget to do one
thing
leaving the mix concealer and see wo
three and load and then on also let me
know if you guys like these like talked
through where I'm like actually sitting
here and talking to you or if you like
voiceovers better obviously the videos
gonna be shorter if I can voice over so
just let me know but I personally like
watching talk through ones because I
like love Nicole Guerrero and she just
like sits there for 20 minutes and talks
I love that and then taking the Beauty
Blender again blending this out oh my
god my place is so hot I don't know I'm
awake if the air conditionings not
working I know I have like lights I'm
here right now so that's like super hot
but last night I was dying it was like
80 degrees Fahrenheit in my house I was
like actually melting I really know how
to work through stuff I'm actually gonna
use this this Rimmel clear complexion
and clarifying powder it's in Oh twenty
one transparent and it says pure and
shine free finish up to five hours
clarify skin things to pure skin complex
known to minimize skin breakouts control
shine and modified skin so we use on my
chin area because I
you get breakouts there and I think this
product is really cool I'm actually just
going to take my Beauty Blender and that
on because it all the brush here
and then you could also put this on any
other parts of your skin then get a
little shiny for under the eyes I'm
going to take the cop Von D shade and
light palette my favorite palette thank
you and sure in did you get me this no
no you got me the eye one and I'm gonna
take the yellowy color mixed with the
lighter color so this one here and this
one here she's mixing them together to
create a nice powder for the V lights
and then I just use a big fluffy crease
brush to put this on also bringing this
over the eyes to set any of that
concealer and foundation um I remember
if I contoured I don't think so but
let's do it
so I'm actually didn't take this warm
contour color and off the ash you wanna
but like it's a little bit warmer just a
very lightly on this Mac angled brush
that 160 and I'm going to very very
lightly contour
just a little bit and then just bringing
any excess up but that's it I'm taking a
large angled brush with my benefit hoola
bronzer and this large angled brush just
like my favorite brush and we're just
gonna go over that the bronze up the
face there's something like on my head
can you see diet I don't know that's
like all my skin felt all through
something can you see that it's really
weird I'm like I was putting makeup on
yesterday and I had no idea what was
going on like what is that kind of
freaking me out like I am I just
sweating like but I'm not it's like a
natural natural highlight I have no idea
what's going on what's happening on both
sides what is that guy's help do you see
I don't know I'm guessing is just dry
skin anyway I'm going to take a particle
your bronzer so this is the Rimmel
bronzer and sunshine with a very light
hand on this end of the brush here I'm
just gonna take some and I'm gonna put
it over the front of my face like this
so it looks super sunkissed so just very
lightly because when you play outside
obviously like this partier face gets
sunkissed
and then guys I don't know I have so
many rental products and just I really
have been liking them I'm gonna take the
Rimmel blush in live pink and this is a
really pretty color if you want that
like sunkissed kind of look after you
take brush I'm gonna take this angled
brush again and just dip it in very
lightly and focus that on my cheeks and
bringing it up I'm obsessed with this
color I think it's so pretty and then it
blends really nicely with that bronzer
as well taking this angle brush which
has no product on and I'm gonna blend
everything out let's throw on a
highlight and my favorite the girl optic
highlight and luster just a little bit
nothing crazy
just a soft sort of shine
so I'm going to take the hoola bronzer
and like a little bit on a crease brush
throw this into the crease just like a
little bit of definition but literally I
said like nothing and then Oh another
Rimmel product rimmel's magnifies and
jumps my favorite highlight color for
inner corners and then I'm taking the
cover FX stick this is in and light and
I'm gonna line my lashline no this is my
waterline and then I'm taking the
Lancome Lenier plume and own 101 Noir
and I'm gonna create a winged liner I'm
gonna try my best to do this on camera
but never really works out too well okay
well they're not great but whatever yeah
it's really hard to do liquid eyeliner
on camera and then taking the Stila
smudge stick waterproof eyeliner and do
my tight line finishing this off I'm
taking oh this is actually what I'm
gonna do my makeup finishing spray it's
the skin giving you skin to be a skin
Danai via finishing spray and I'm so
spritz all of my face let that sink in
and then take any benefit roller lash
and coating my lashes even put falsies
on if you want it I'm just probably a
falsie person because I read I didn't I
think they always fall off but I love
the way they look in the video I'm
actually meeting three lip options I
think so in the video that I in the holy
grail video as wearing this lip combo
here this is the LEAs watch a twisting
sharp long lasting lip thing in okura
line so it's like a pretty coral color
and then I put the Revlon
colorburst in 2d 3d overtop this combo I
love I think it creates a really pretty
orange color so I'm going to show you
that now actually now that I remember it
wasn't wearing this lip combo I was but
I also added in the dose of color in
bare with me with this just putting the
two fruity right on top for some
moisture the orange is really pretty
when you have a tan so that's the orange
color that's really pretty
and then you could do you wanted that
color that I had in the video you could
just throw this over top that was the
color that I had in that video so it's
just that over top of the orange which
is a really really pretty color I really
like this color so I'm going to show you
two other ones the next one is probably
my new favorite color combination for
summer the esses lip liner and wish me
arose really inexpensive and really
creamy I really like the stuff so like
it just glides right on so it's like a
really pretty bright pink color and then
I put the covergirl
Oh sugar lip thing in cupcake this by
itself is really pretty just for like a
lip balm but the sort of top with this
looks divine
so it's just a really pretty like fresh
spring/summer color
I would love I'm in love with this lip
combination I'm probably gonna wear this
lip combination I like music wrestling
stuff this is really easy and like you
don't do really worry about it it kind
of just sits on the lip since I love it
now that I'm blonde I like really like
Pink's and then the last thing is a red
black lip color is this revlon
colorburst matte balm in striking
spectacular and
it's a oranjee sort of pinky red I think
it's really pretty for summer and like
super easy to wear and it's not like a
red lipstick it's just a little more
summery slides on super buildable really
easy to wear exactly what I want for
summer it's just like a really pretty
summer color I think red looks really
pretty with the tan you could just clean
it up the edges with a cover-up effects
or like some concealer but I'm gonna do
that
so yeah oh god I'm on this color it's so
pretty um that's a makeup look I hope
