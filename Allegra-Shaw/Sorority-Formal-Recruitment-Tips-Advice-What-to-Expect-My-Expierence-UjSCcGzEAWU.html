awful intro hello hey guys and welcome
to my sorority recruitment video this
has been long long requested so actually
just gonna be like a sorority video in
general so I'm going to give you a
little background information on my
sorority in my experience there is a
sorority girl tag video so I have some
of the questions here so I can just like
kind of go through them and give you my
my experience so what is your sorority I
am in Kappa Alpha Theta
I am now an alumni one alumna story I'm
an alumna um our hand sign is this and
this you always want to rush I not
really kind of like it was kind of in my
head um I went through a crewman in
second year and not first year and yeah
I was very open-minded I didn't know if
I was even gonna join a sorority but I
thought why not just like go through the
experience and I'm really happy I did it
was like it made my university
experience it really did how was
recruitment for you it was good it was a
tiring really tiring it was like I don't
know it was not it's not really me I'm
not very like outgoing and not going but
like I'm not very bubbly so it was kind
of weird but uh yeah it was good okay
all the questions after that suck so on
my school there was five sororities on
campus
so what recruitment is it's a full
recruitment process and as if you watch
other videos everyone will say it's a
mutual selection process there's
literally no better way to explain it
you go around to all the houses or the
parties I don't know whatever they call
it your school and I think like you'll
rank what ones
work for you on they if they feel the
same way you'll get matched up in
whatever the first day and is usually
Friday and it's orientation at night so
go to or go to orientation they'll tell
you about everything that is going to
happen over the weekend looking at dress
codes they'll give you the you know the
financial obligation whatever they'll
give you all all you need to know it's
your time to ask questions the first day
you'll go to every single house you will
meet all the sororities and this is the
longest day that probably the most
tiring day but it is essentially need to
go to every single sorority house and
then depending on how many stories you
have the number will go down and then
the last day it's prep night so we have
only three days so two days of like
meeting the houses and then prep night
well here is some advice for going
through recruitment my first piece of
advice is go to orientation don't skip
out a night you don't need to dress up
or anything you're just going to like
get the gist of what's going on you know
make you feel a little more comfortable
about going and be open-minded be able
to minded going into it I did research
before and honestly I recommend doing
research before kind of getting the hang
of like what sorority what what
sororities there are like what they
stand for whatever but be open-minded
going into it don't pick a sorority just
cuz you're friends in it it's Greek like
everyone's together so it's really
matter if you're in the same sorority I
mean like obviously you'll have a closer
bond if you are in the same sorority but
like it's like you're not going to see
them during the actual party house
whatever talk to as many girls as
possible you want to make an impression
so talks with many girls as possible
it's very similar to speed-dating so you
will get passed around a lot don't take
offense that someone's passing around
probably even a good thing also have a
cool fact about yourself my facts were
that I lived with guys I looked at five
guys and I was there do black belt in
karate so those were things that like
made me stand out and the girls could
remember me by and I know that it helped
because I talked the girls after and
they're like yeah you were the girl that
lived with five guys and I was like
that's me so it's always good to have it
just have three fun facts for yourself
that are different from
or everyone else so if you talk about
their life you speak another language if
you are really good at a sport if you
horseback ride I don't know like
whatever just have something that
differentiates yourself and on the topic
of differential yourself where something
that kind of is different and like
stands out so for me one day I had like
a leopard print scarf like wrapped
around my purse just like stood out a
little bit and was um just made me like
pop up you know and if you have
something like a cool necklace or
something you know where it two days in
a row and then the girls remember you oh
that was the girl with the cool necklace
like because these girls on the other
side of recruitment like the actual
actives
they are meeting so many girls like you
think you're meeting a lot of girls
they're meeting tons and tons of girls
and having to remember your name
and having trim who you are is difficult
so you want to make yourself stand out
if you know you have a cool hairstyle
where that I don't know that was I think
that's really stupid advice don't go to
recruitment hung over don't go out the
night before it is awful I didn't do it
but like I saw girls come through Korea
they were clearly hungover and it is so
tiring and we having over you don't like
talk to everyone try to like not go out
the night before and not be tired or you
will have a miserable day if you really
liked a sorority and you don't get
called back to the house it's okay the
girls in the sorority know their
sorority really well and they don't feel
like you would have meshed in or
whatever their reasons were it's okay
you will end up where you belong so in
the end just like don't be too upset
about it and don't drop out because that
sorry that was number one in your head
was the you didn't get that one just go
through it and you will end up where you
belong have a question or two ready to
go to ask the girls so I'll be like oh
would you have any questions for me you
know they feel awkward to it is an
awkward thing it's like speed dating
with women it's kind of just weird so if
you have a question like I am right I
mean it's not like I actually was very
passionate about it but I would be I
would ask like what their philanthropy
was about or when did they meet
something like that just don't like
don't bomb are bombarded them with
question
and just like have to if you ready go
especially if the conversation like dies
little or asked what the girl like Oh
what your un what program are you in you
know us it just have a comment like a
normal conversation don't yeah you know
don't tell the girls how much you
absolutely love this sorority like you
can say oh I really like it here I think
it's great I would love to be in a
sorority
but don't like gosh and gosh about how
much you're obsessed this joy because
like you know about sorority and it kind
of makes the girls feel weird so just
you know be cool Beach Oh like you
wouldn't want to like gush to a guy but
how much you adore him be nice the
people you go through recruitment with
even try make friends with them I
actually met shrim he was my best friend
if you don't watch my videos she's in
like all of my videos I met her on the
front line of Pi Phi on the second day
of recruitment and we ended up being the
same sorority which obviously it was
meant to be but you never know who
you're gonna meet
so even if you don't even end up being
in Grieg like you might meet some really
cool people during their permit process
don't talk about fraternities don't talk
about fraternity men don't say that you
have so many friends and fraternities
and just you have so many guy friends we
like we don't care as active we you know
it's great if you already have some
friends in Greek life but you're not
there to mingle with fraternities you
are there to be in a sorority with these
women
so keep that in mind I really didn't
like when girls would tell me how they
were um so had so many friends in this
certain fraternity I think if your dad
was in a fraternity and something like
that that's epic
tell me about that you know if your
grandfather was the founder of one
fraternity on campus what I want to hear
about that's I don't I don't hear they
partied with all of the like stigmatize
last weekend
although Sigma Chi I love you I was
sweetheart of Sigma Zions I love them um
as I said check out the sororities
online before do some research I would
the P did all the sororities I liked to
hear about or I like to read about like
who the alumni was or were and who was
in the sorority in the States and stuff
I just thought it was really interesting
I am history
so obviously I found that interesting
and my last tip for the actual
recruitment process is there's going to
be a lot of chanting there's gonna a lot
be a lot of uh you know free
in-your-face like clapping and chanting
and that's okay that's like totally
normal your first size you might be a
little freaked out but totally normal
eyebrows is gonna do that to you when it
comes to dressing yourself for
recruitment it really depends on your
school I know some schools give out
t-shirts uh some people say it generally
goes more dressy I had no idea what I
was supposed to wear like like no no
clue so the orientation I showed up in
like a sweater and pants and some girls
room like heels and dresses and I was
like I feel uncomfortable but like and
now that I know it's fine that I showed
up and like nothing too fancy these are
not meeting anyone that day just depends
on your school if you get a t-shirt
that's awesome but we don't get a
t-shirt I don't know if my dressed
appropriate like I didn't dress
inappropriately but I'm pretty sure I
wore jeans one day and I like at our
school that's not really a big deal
where one thing that stands out as I
said before I don't wear heels it is
honestly not worth it if you want to
wear like a little bit of heel or booty
totally go for it but an actual high
heel you're walking and standing all day
and you will die like it you're getting
so much pain you think that going out at
night and wearing heels is hard no
walking for ten hours from you know we
get busted like from house to house or
like standing outside the house or like
standing in the party you just just
don't wear heels like it's really not
going to change your outfit that much
preference sight is the time to wear
heels and a dress go all out where if
you distress I'm video when I war it's
really dark video back when I didn't
know what I was doing with the camera um
I just wore like a cute little marine
dress and heels and yeah um be fashion
will be comfortable but stay away from
that like classy sexy look you don't
want to wear a club dress appropriate I
wore pants and a shirt and a jacket
every day
I could maybe put some videos up of like
what to wear it just depends on the
climate that you're in right like
recruitment for us is usually most
freezing weekend so um pants flats
blouse jacket purse is what I wore and
then the next day I were like booties
jeans this really cute shirt and a big
sweater like slouchy sweater and at
first looked pretty good it was pretty
casual but like i looked fashionable and
it looked comfortable and like i think
the girls like that bring jock in her
sweater especially if you go to school
in canada or you know northern part of
the world um we had to stand outside
forever and it was freezing cold and
these girls were in little dresses my
felt so bad for them when I was - warm
cozy sweater it's a pretty jacket even
if it's too hot you just like throw it
in your bag um last year this one girl
wore sweatpants to recruitment and
looked super hungover don't do that okay
wear deodorant because you're gonna
sweat as well I forgot to wear deodorant
on craft night and let me tell you I
regretted that decision and as I said
wear something more than once it may
stand out perfect uh what to bring bring
a purse not something too big but you
know it fits everything you're gonna
need some touch-up items maybe like a
powder or whatever whatever touch up
your makeup with maybe concealer I don't
know whatever you want bring water
you're gonna need water bring snacks a
granola bars make healthy because
they'll serve you food either actually
usually the first I don't serve a food
so you're probably going to want to eat
so bring some food um definitely have
like mints and gum on you that being
said if you're gonna bring down don't
you drink room it's just rude and
everything else just be yourself you
will end up in the house that you are
supposed to be in every story has a
different personality you will see that
as you go through some are very preppy
and girly and someone more chill and
laid-back and some are you know you'll
just see what they're like and since I
have like a very versatile I think I
think I have a very versatile
personality I could have ended up in
three houses I still to this day think
that like I obviously my university
experiences would have been very very
different but easily could have ended up
in three houses but I ended up the data
I'm happy by decision I meant my flock
walk if you're watching us love you I'm
at the girls that you know will be at my
wedding and are there for you no matter
what so I really recommend sporty
Freeman especially if you had a bad for
sure don't be afraid to rush in second
yard that's right
don't be afraid to go through and second
year and yeah I hope you guys if you
were going out for recruitment all the
best to you I wish you luck
bye we resemble astral car move it we
