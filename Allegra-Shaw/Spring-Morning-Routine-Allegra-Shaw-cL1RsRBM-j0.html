a.m. I just checked my phone to see if
there's anything urgent if not I just
throw a robe on and start my day the
first thing I usually do in the morning
is I make coffee I have a whole what I
eat in a day video which will be linked
down below if you want to check that out
so I'm just making my favorite coffee
kicking horse coffee and yeah
so while the water is boiling I'll
usually head over the bathroom if your
my hair ups wash some water onto my face
depending on the morning sometimes I'll
wash my face and sometimes I won't just
depends on how I'm feeling this morning
I felt pretty great so I just threw some
water on my face
I will also brush my teeth brushing my
teeth is like the first thing that I
want to do in the morning I know some
people think it's gross to brush your
teeth before you eat and drink coffee
and stuff but I like half do I just feel
disgusting if I don't brush my teeth so
that's what I'm doing then I head back
over I'm usually drinking water while
things are boiling and I'm making
breakfast I would also normally make
breakfast at this time but since I was
filming I couldn't really make breakfast
I didn't have enough time so I'm just
pouring my hot water into my french
press and then I let my coffee steep for
about 4 to 5 minutes sometimes I forget
about it and it was longer but I try for
4 to 5 minutes
and then while that's steeping this is
when I will go my phone and I will check
Instagram or Twitter anything that's
like kind of not important
so I cousin tagged me in this fucking
rude
I also love to start my morning with
music so I'm gonna go to music app and
put the strokes on or you know I love to
wake up to Kanye or whatever anything
that's like upbeat it's my day started
so just listening to music and then I'm
gonna pour my coffee
you
after coffee is poured I usually sit on
my couch and if I have breakfast I'll
eat my breakfast and this is when I will
check emails and do any emails than they
need to do I like to do those in the
morning get those out of the way
after I'm done my emails I will head to
the bathroom and I will start getting
ready for the day so I will put the
serums and the creams in my face I
actually have a full skincare routine
that is very recent so I will link that
down below and on the screen you can
probably just click me annotation and
it'll take you to the video but that's
where I'll explain like everything that
I actually do in the morning and the
same time I like to shower actually in
the middle of the day that's why you
haven't seen me shower
I usually shower around like three as a
break from work so I don't shower in the
mornings and I wash my hair once we can
use dry shampoo I'm not dirty I got a
lot comments last time about your not
showering
I will then put on my makeup I have an
everyday makeup routine as well so that
will be linked on the screen and down
below if you want to check that out I'd
want to film the whole thing or this
video would be very long so I was just
meeting my to moisturizer on but if you
want to check out the full video you can
I then head back to my room and I make
my bed with smart bedding making your
bed is so simple I will just like do
this and it's done it doesn't happen
doesn't take a long time at all because
we talk sheet is connected to the duvet
cover and it just makes things really
easy and simple and had I not had smart
betting I probably would make my bed
every morning just so I hate making my
bed but this makes it really easy and it
looks nice and still Cuffy took like one
second to make the bed which is nice and
then see and then I will get dressed
finally
so now that I am clothed I can go and
open my blinds
he's my building does space out onto
another building after my blinds closed
or else everyone will see me naked and I
like to have dance parties in the
morning so just having a dance party and
then I pack my bag grab my computer I
grab my shoes and my coat whenever I
need the day and I head out the door and
start my day that's it I hope you guys
