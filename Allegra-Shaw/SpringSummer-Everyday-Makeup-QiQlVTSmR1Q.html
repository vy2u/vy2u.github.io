everyday makeup routine because it has
changed a lot and I will probably be
keeping this makeup routine throughout
spring and into summer music very
lightweight very lightweight coverage um
I did it on a day where I broke out so
you can see how I like cover
imperfections um but with with keeping
it very light I would this look
basically every day if I'm just like
running errands like you know taking
care of business if I'm going to a
medium something I usually vamp it up a
little bit but this is like very simple
makeup perfect for like high school just
like going to class and College weekends
like it is just it is just enhancing
your natural features um you could add a
bit of highlight I didn't highlight
anything because I wanted to get super
natural anything that's really great for
summer so yeah let's just get ready to
video I really want to talk this video
but they're drilling next door so cool
we all just get right into the video
first I'm taking my Laura Mercier tinted
moisturizer in the color bisque this
color matches my body also much my face
but I really really love this stuff um
it's really buildable but breathable and
it's the best tinted moisturizer I've
used ever little pricey but I love it so
I just put it on my fingers and I make
sure my hands are clean before I touch
my face and then I also wash my hands
after I hate having makeup on my hands
so I'll just blend it in and I'll press
it in with my fingers and kind of melt
it into the skin so it's kind of like a
lotion almost next I'm taking the NYX
concealer in cwo 3 and I am putting that
on this
and underneath my eyes those actually
really aren't zits anymore they're kind
of just like dried up gross
and then I'm blending everything out
with my damp Beauty Blender
I'll also kind of go over my tinted
moisturizer as well to make sure it's
all blended in and seamless and then
after that I'll take my YSL Touche Claw
concealer I'm not sure what color this
is but it's pretty light and I'll just
brighten up under the eyes and anywhere
just to give my face a little more
dimension so it's not super flat because
I won't be highlighting and then I'll
blend that out with my damp Beauty
Blender hi sometimes skip this step but
I'm taking the Revlon nearly naked
powder in o30 medium and I'm just kind
of dusting it on my face and I take a
smaller fluffy brush and I put it right
on any like zits and stuff to really
keep them covered up all day if I don't
have any zits I'll probably skip the
powder and just use a finishing spray um
because it does the same thing and then
I'm just taking my hoola bronzer and the
large angled brush and just kind of
warming up the face again adding some
dimension and a little warmth to the
visage and then I'm taking my Dallas
bronzer in a stippling brush you kind of
just stippling that on my cheeks I
either use this eye or use a tint or I
use that Maybelline bouncy blush so I
just kind of switch it up but this is my
favorite one it's just the most natural
and then after that I just use a benefit
but tinted primer for my mascara I don't
go crazy on the Oscar just kind of coat
all my lashes and that's basically all I
do you can definitely add some
highlights you know in the inner corners
of your eyes and to bring up the face a
little bit but
I'm happy with this so yeah if you
liking the products they will be linked
down below other math I hope you guys
enjoyed this video and I'll talk to you
soon
love you all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
