of things very difficult feeling very
girly today I am wearing pink and I this
looks like a robe it's actually a dress
I'll link it down below cuz I don't know
what the brand is I am wearing this Sun
bum skips la I'm wearing this Sun bum
lip tint the pink one on my lips and I
love a really natural look today I've
kind of actually gone off a foundation
and I am starting to not wear foundation
that's just because my skin is really
good not like a look at my skin I also
feel like I follow a bunch of pregnant
youtubers and I'm like oh they're going
all natural like it's my turn don't
worry my necklace is I got the most flux
body scrub yesterday so I look to be all
for that but it is I got at the hammam
spa Toronto and it's like it's coming
out in June I might make a blog post my
favorite spa treatments but it was luxe
it was like the salaah body treatment I
don't know is amazing okay Soho let's
just get into it
I ran out of coffee espresso coffee so
I'm drinking a hazelnut one I'm not a
huge hazelnut coffee person okay so
today I'm gonna do I did a poll on my
Instagram if you guys aren't following
me on Instagram you should my Instagram
username is Allegra Shah very easy this
is how I like ask you guys questions I
connect with you I answer most of my
fans I can try to answer as many as I
can I'm really active on Instagram so if
you want to like connect with me and
kind of be part part of like my little
community Instagram is definitely the
way to go I also have Twitter how you do
a lot of my Q days and stuff on Twitter
so grab it I'm watching my own story oh
my god I asked you guys on Instagram if
you would rather see a way I eat in a
day or a summer body routine and summer
abroad routine one I will do it what I
eat in a day as well but it's probably
do it later so it's my summer bod
routine if you were like what the fuck
is that I don't know I do it's it's
basically how what I'm doing to get in
shape for summer just little things that
I add I've done a few like you know
tips and like stuff like that but I feel
like this is what I do when I know
summers like right around the corner I
do want to preface this video by saying
I have been working out and eating
healthily for you know I've been working
out for since first year university
systems 2012 consistently and then you
know I eat pretty healthy consistently
since I graduated University definitely
didn't eat healthy at university that's
why I'm singing what I eat days during
that time sounds like a pasta oh
drinking oh so my first tip is to work
out like come on that's just the first
step has to be so my workout routine you
know the winter it's cold it's dark I
don't go to the gym as often that's
that's just life I do a lot of like at
home workout so I'm not lifting you know
weights and stuff as much but so my
workout routine leading up to summer is
I lift heavy weights for my booty like
one to two times a week so that's like a
full leg and booty workout a few of
those my challenge want to check those
out and then I also with those days will
do like my full complete like at workout
so those two days a week I'm like really
pushing it out the gym I'm really busy
now so getting to the gym and working
out has definitely become harder when I
first graduated university or when I was
in university I just had way more time
so I could spend like you know an hour
and a half a day at the gym but like
it's just not feasible right now with my
work schedule so I try to get as much
exercise as I can in but I'm not like
beating myself up every day if I can't
go that's just like my life right now I
hope that you know when I get you know
as I I just hope that one day I can go
back in the gym and spend an hour and a
half you know like I loved that that's
just life right now so then I make sure
that I go to the gym like two times a
week and really like push it with the
weights I also try to up my cardio a lot
while I'm working out for the summer I
try to like cut down some cardio will
like help you cut walking on an incline
Sprint's that's kind of what I switch
out between and then I also do lean
muscle building workouts so I've really
incorporated this to my workout
since I can't go to the gym all the time
I do at home workout so I have like a
whole set over here and it's just a
really thick yoga mat I have like eight
pound weights and like three pound
weights have a bunch of different
resistance bands and I just could have
had like a whole setup set when I can't
go to the gym I can workout at home I do
do YouTube video workouts my favorite
workouts are I mean I don't really stray
that much so I can't say that tried like
a ton but I my friend Bailey projects
upper body shows in Australia she does
workouts like on the beach and I feel
pain after them and I'm like pretty
strong but these workouts definitely
work muscles but I'm not used to working
out so I love that I think she's really
good options and they're pretty short so
they're like 15 minutes of sometimes you
know I'm feeling frisky I'll do two of
them sold you like the fat-burning one
and the booty building one or like the
arm one and whatever so I do work out
five times a week two times for sure the
gym five times it's kind of a gym kind
of at home the first thing is working
out and starting a workout routine
that's my current workout routine build
whatever you can you can go to the gym
five days a week I am jealous good for
you number two again this is really
classic eating healthy I have a lot of
videos on tips you like kind of not
trick yourself to eating healthy but
like different like weight loss so sorry
said they'll be linked down below or in
the cards
but tips that I've just been like doing
recently are when I get my I've been
eating out a lot just because of travel
schedules and you know life right now
getting my life but together traveling
so much and I just have no food so when
I get my food I always fill up on my
greens first so if it comes with a solid
I'll eat the solid first to kind of fill
up on that before I go into my other
foods eating low calorie but high
density foods that kind of fill up your
stomach is a great tip I actually follow
this girl on Instagram
has really great food tips her Instagram
is meow
Meek's now mix meow mix so she has a lot
of like great things to switch out I
don't you can see this but like you know
instead of having that have that instead
of eating that eat that so that's a
great you know if you're kind of
confused with food like I feel like
everyone is that's a great one number
three is a good nutrient pack morning
smoothie I do this in all my wedding in
two days I have a smoothie recipe on my
blog that I love and it's just filled
with like protein and vitamins and
nutrients and minerals just like jam
tacos stuff so my treatment of those in
the morning I feel like all right I got
all everything I needed to get into it
today and everything else is after this
is kind of like a breeze so really
really love a good protein nutrient pack
smoothie in the morning it kind of like
cake starts my day okay number three I
think this is something that's very
overlooked by a lot of people when
they're looking to you know get in shape
is taking care of your gut health I've
been doing this since I saw my
naturopath when I look at my parents
house because I have a lot of stomach
problems I had a lot of acne and my skin
has just let me tell you beautiful but
taking a probiotic a prebiotic and
adjust of enzyme daily will really help
you you know flatten your stomach make
you feel good
help food digests better not blow all
those things that just suck so that is
like critical critical part of my health
routine got health number four and the
most annoying tip in the whole world is
drink water and I know everyone hates
this but honestly life-changing when you
start drinking the amount of water that
you should be drinking life changing you
don't feel like shit when you wake up in
the morning yes you have to pee every
five seconds but it is worth it like
your stomach doesn't hurt as much you
don't get headaches like everything that
wasn't wrong with me was to do with like
my god and my water intake for sure
my skin is cleared up so much since I've
been drinking I thought I was drinking a
lot of water before
like I just wasn't drinking enough like
drinking too you know 500 milliliter
bottles a day just wasn't good enough
for me so I bought this again I'm gonna
get my phone this app called my water
and there's a time different ones but
like I just this isn't the first one on
the app list this one gives you a
reminder and when you should drink water
because obviously if you just like wake
up in the morning and drink you know two
and a half liters of water that's not
how water intake works so you need to
like obviously can keep drinking water
throughout the day so I went set to 2.5
litres a day of water and I try to hit
that so you can have a drink and you can
see you like you can add like a bunch of
different drinks so water coffee and
then it'll tell you like how much water
and take you golf muttering and then
also drinking wine or like alcohol it'll
lower your water intake so you know how
to make up for the water that you lost
and drinking that alcohol so I really
like that water app not really keeps me
on track and since having not a lot
better I don't even really track my
water anymore but when it's their mind
there's a new I live in a building so
somewhat when someone knocks my door
really about again I live in a building
so wait oh really
anyway and then number five is actually
self tan self tanning is like the
easiest way to like look slimmer and I I
think feel more confident I always tell
people when they're shopping for bathing
suits and stuff have a nice tan on and
like how your makeup and hair done
because you're just gonna feel better
about yourself there's a ton different
hands loving tan Bondi sans Bali body
they all have like Tam that you can our
center peg center of a centre PES
whatever it works for you is good always
use attending dinner in an orange hands

Sunday organic and beloved tanner my
favourites

everything will be linked down below and
having a tan on just
makes you look slimmer you know it's
like a 30 minute weight loss and toning
miracle it's crazy how I think my buck
body looks like way better when I have a
tan on I feel more confident when I have
tan all that stuff so having a tan on I
think is just a really great way to feel
and look better
