you my Sunday night routine this is what
I do after a big weekend to help me
relax and get prepared for the week the
first thing that I want to do when I get
home is I want to put on a sweat suit
and take off all of my makeup so
Neutrogena has sponsored this video and
collaborated with me to test out their
Neutrogena double cleanse routine so I'm
just throwing my hair up taking my sweat
shirt off make it easier to wash my face
these products are specifically designed
for certain skin types so I got the dry
and sensitive skin one I first go in
with the Neutrogena makeup remover wipes
and I wipe away all my face makeup and
all my eye makeup I even bring it down
to my neck and just take away everything
takes off all my makeup super easily and
takes off my super hard to get off
mascara and it doesn't sting or irritate
my eyes at all which I really look for
in a product and it really leaves my
skin feeling hydrated so I've been
loving these
so as you can see all that makeup is now
removed but I can't just use a makeup
remover wipe as I do break out a lot so
I do need that second step I go with the
Neutrogena ultra gentle daily cleanser
and this gives me a deeper clean and
leaves my skin feeling smooth and
healthy it's a really lightweight
formula it smells super fresh and really
clean I like that and it feels really
gentle in the face so my skin doesn't
feel dry or tight after using this and
it removes whatever was left on my face
and just like I want no makeup left on
my face I want nothing so it just really
cleanses everything and it leaves my
face feeling super soft the Neutrogena
has specifically designed double
cleansing routines for different skin
types and there's five combinations to
choose from if you want to learn more
about the double cleanse routine visit
the link in the description and get
yourself started I then just finish off
with a super hydrating moisturizer as
well as this really hydrating eye cream
and that will be it for my skin routine
and then I will make myself dinner
sometimes all you with my parents
sometimes I will grab food and bring it
home but tonight I made myself a salad
just spring mix cucumbers tomatoes and
some feta cheese
Shh don't tell anyone of the cheese and
then I also had some tuna because I just
needed some more and if you actually put
the tuna in the salad it's really good
as well but that's what I have for
dinner
I will then sit on my couch I will grab
my computer and I will see what's up for
the week I'll look at my calendar
I will check emails I'll put stuff into
my calendar I have this black book where
I write down checklists of things I need
to do each day or for the week so I will
do that and I will just do all the
things that I need to do to prepare of
the week I'll figure out what days I
will be able to work out and what I'm
gonna do and what events are going on
and so I'll do that for quite a bit of
time I like to start off the week with a
clean house so I will do laundry I will
you note the dishwasher or put things in
the dishwasher I'll vacuum clean the
floors and then after I like to meditate
every morning but I don't usually
meditate on the weekend so on Sunday
nights I get my meditation on and clear
my mind I just feel like it really helps
me prepare for the week
after meditating I will boil some water
I will cut up some lemon and Island hot
lemon water drink I've talked about this
before but I really like this drink I
think it's really great for your skin I
apparently helps you lose weight but
just good for your digestive system like
it's just all around a great drink so I
love to drink that and you know sort of
detox my body a little bit from the
weekend I then head to bed I love my bed
it's so comfortable so I just love
hanging out my TV's in my room so I'll
throw on a movie um or I'll watch
youtube videos or something but I'll
just take this time to like relax and
chill and hang out by myself then when
it's getting close to bedtime I will
head to the bathroom and I will brush my
teeth like an old person oh then head
back to bed
and actually get into bed as I am you
know starting the process of going to
sleep but I'll grab my phone I will
check Instagram I'll check snapchat
Twitter you know all that good stuff and
I will take off my sweatshirt so I
always get super hot when I sleep and
then I will check my computer awesome
emails whatever and then I like to put a
really thick hand cream on my hands and
my feet especially on my body too but
especially my hands at the die very dry
hands and feet um yeah then I'll just
check my emails whatever I need to do on
the computer maybe throw in a YouTube
video I have catching up and then that's
it for the night I will close down my
computer turn off all the lights and I
will go to sleep hope you guys enjoy
this video
love you all talk to you soon peace and
love</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
