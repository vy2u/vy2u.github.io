want to get some videos done because I
am moving in two weeks which is crazy I
am moving out of my parents house and
down to Trump downtown Toronto
absolutely 50 minutes with my parents so
it's not the biggest move but finally
with me on my parents house which would
be nice because I'll have this great
space to actually film videos for you
guys which will be amazing so I posted
video like a month ago and just asked
for some questions so I'm going to
that's it do I go to a tanning booth or
do you spray tan so I'm actually
allergic to spray tan well okay I had a
really bad experience with spray tan I
got a spray tan to new year's just know
three new years ago I bought a spray tan
the day before and I threw up all the
New Year's night like the whole day and
night I was I literally got poisoned by
the spray tan I don't lose just that
specific spray tan or if I'm just
whipped all spray tans but like I don't
really wanna risk getting another I
really don't want to have that bod of
the day ever again
it was the worst day ever so I can't
really get spray tans from my experience
with them so I do two things I use
Sandra Pez or you know like the self
tanners I use those a lot and I do also
go to a booth give me the lecture down
below and how bad it is for you I know
tanning is not good for you I don't do
it very often but I do do it I go to a
place called classic tan and they
actually have special beds where you
don't have to go as often there like
it's just like a really high quality
place and although I know tanning is not
good for you no matter how high quality
the beds are these beds are actually
very high quality and you go in for a
longer period of time and it's a
lower light thing I don't know I don't
explain this how do you go in for you go
in for 22 minutes you do 12 minutes on
your front and 10 minutes on your back
and I really only have to go like once
you get your desired coloring to
maintain you could go like once a month
like it isn't it's a really good place
and it is the best place for tanning you
can go tanning spa here so I do you see
at your festival is your dream job
in what field do you want to work so I'm
kind of like working in the field that I
want to work in um right now this is
great like I love doing YouTube and I
love making YouTube videos so I have
really been putting all my energy and
focus into this to kind of make it a
career for myself and I hope that one
day it will be a career right it will
fully keep me financially stable on top
of that I you know I love to work in
their retail industry so I have a few
endeavors that I am working on and yeah
so I do I want to I am an entrepreneur
I'm not willing to work for another
company I'm gonna keep everything I'm
gonna do everything myself and yeah
there's some really exciting things
coming up in my life that will actually
benefit you guys so keep updated with
that but you know the next couple months
are gonna be pretty crazy and pretty
amazing so yeah keep updated for that
but this is the field I want to work in
I'm pretty happy with everything what's
your tattoo of and the meeting so I have
to have two tattoos I have this one here
and then I have a twelve on my back this
one I got a triangle a long time ago and
I was kind of just bored to try wow I
need to put some emotion on my skin um I
was kind of just bored the triangle it's
just too small I just wanted something
bigger and better so I got my cousin to
do
this honestly there's no real meaning
for it I could literally make a
meaning if you want but there's no
reading I love the design I love the top
- I don't necessarily think there needs
to be meeting behind every tattoo so
that's kind of my take on it I think if
you want it she got it is all about your
body for the rest of your life so it is
a big decision but I know what kind of
feels I want to work in as I just said
which it's not gonna affect my work
and now I just I really love this tattoo
and don't even ever get sick of war know
the hits I really like that it kind of
kind of going to notice that's there
anymore but I do love it and you know my
cousin designed it if you want to check
out he's a really great artist if you
want to check him out his Instagram is I
bought me done one up about right here
but the toll on my dock is matching 12
with my dad that is my dad sobriety date
so that is why I have the 12 I'll be
back the next question is what is the
best and worst thing about being on
YouTube so the best thing is being able
to be creative making videos the
feedback from you guys and having like
an interaction with you guys and having
this following like it's just a really
nice community that I feel like I've
created here on my channel so I love
that aspect I love the opportunities
that I've gotten as all the people as
the people that I've met so that's been
a really the best part about YouTube the
worst part is um the Internet can be a
very negative space I think that's some
people's comments it just can be a very
something will have a lot to say that is
negative and without really knowing
anything about it I don't know it's I
understand if you don't like a video or
if you don't like something but the way
people comment it's like the meanest way
that you could say something
and it just it kind of confuse because I
would never I would never personally do
that to someone so it's just kind of
confusing I mean but I thought is
probably the worst part it's just the
negativity that people put out there on
the Internet as well it can be very
difficult to find a great place to film
and lighting it is so difficult to find
good lighting find a good place to film
especially when you don't have a big
house or you don't have your own place
so it lost you know a couple years I've
been out my parents house I've been at
school where my apartment isn't that
nice I like bright so yeah I can be very
hard that way and they can also be hard
to find someone to film to you for about
the video so it's like just a learning
process but the worst thing is the
negativity that I just find so
unnecessary can you feel me University
Western experience video yeah I can film
a university experience video I'd rather
have questions though because I'm
somebody I was a great experience I had
a sorority on experienced video if you
want to look at facts but if you want to
send me questions about University for
sure I just graduated so it's very fresh
in my memory and tell us a little bit
about your gym routine so I used to the
gym five days a week no excuses I would
be there every single day but since life
that's kind of picked up and I'm pretty
busy now I go 100% three times a week
and then I will try to go so I go Monday
Wednesday Friday your honor what and
then I will try to go to like a class or
yoga class Tuesdays and Thursdays if I
have the time so that's my dream routine
right now where do you get your
inspiration for fashion so I look
outfits all the time they look at
youtubers bloggers I look on Pinterest I
look at the men's style a lot I really
like looking at like Kanye West's style
Kylie Jenner like I just look at a bunch
of different people and then kind of
make it my own
you mentioned on Instagram and on way
old videos that you are scared to model
when you were younger what's the story
of being scouted and what happened after
your scouted so when I was four
or 13 I was scouted twice no three times
let's get it a couple times for modeling
but I you know I went into meetings and
I did everything that you do when you're
scouted but I do short I there was one
agency that watched me for a couple
years
to see if I was going to grow but I
never did I'm only five six and do you
need to be five eight at least so that
was basically it
I really wanted to do it but I just was
not tall enough so do I live in Toronto
yes I do live in Toronto are your go-to
shops for clothes uh uh
All Saints I really like All Saints Zara
hmm sort of not really that much anymore
um I like to online shop a lot just
different boutiques I don't know I don't
really been trying to cut back on
shopping because I am moving out and I
need to save my money so yeah but that's
those are basically do I count calories
no no no no I don't I try to eat a
really healthy balanced lifestyle but I
I have no I don't even know how to count
calories like no idea what is your
advice for smaller youtubers and how do
you deal with the haters advice for
small youtubers just keep doing what
you're doing
um be true you work hard put up
interesting content and try to keep
consistent I know it's hard when you're
smaller to keep consistent but like I
didn't for years
just keep it consist have a date and put
a video of that day I think that's a
great tip to build your channel as well
how do I deal with the haters honestly
like I just try to ignore
sometimes all response they're really
sassy comment that's why I'm in a feisty
mood but I just try to ignore it I mean
like maybe they have their own issues
they need to deal with and it has
nothing to do with me
which makeup basic products should girls
have um I think I'm good like tinted
moisturizer the basics for me are
like a foundation or digital moisturizer
a concealer a blush a bronzer and
mascara those are the things that I wear
every day five major products and I
think those can take you a long long way
where do you get your hair colored I
live in Toronto and love to know okay I
got my hair colored a parlor in the
beaches I got my hair color light and
heat amita and she is amazing I highly
recommend her if you are looking at your
hair colored and you have Atrato
check her out because she really listens
to what you want and she's not gonna
just do what she wants she's really
really great her job so and tell her I
sent you if you do end up going um
Anita in the beaches I'll put it in the
link below where would I want to live
besides Toronto whoo that's a tough
question
I love Toronto I really do I mean the
weather is like pretty shaped but I was
born and raised here it's a big city and
I don't know I love it really you know
put down roots here so I feel like it
would be hard to tell you although the
only time I could see myself leaving is
if I like I had a husband and he had a
job somewhere it's not like my job is
really rooted in Toronto so I could
probably pick up and move but I don't
know it would be hard for me it would be
um
where would I want to live so I would
love to live in London England I want
family in England
my dad's British family's British so
that would be pretty easy move for me I
really love Berlin I went to Berlin two
years ago and I felt about that city I
think it's like the coolest city ever so
Berlin would definitely be up there New
York I could do these New York's a
beautiful city I mean like how long are
we talking like how long women and
moving forever because those those
theses like I said I'm gonna have to
move to a city about to move forever for
a short period of time I could go like
tons of places no no that's a tough
question it's a good question though
where would you move if you were going
to move that is if my Q&amp;amp;A thank you for
watching I haven't
questions can only leading down below
and I'll do another Q&amp;amp;A and pull months
so yeah thank you so much mother call me
