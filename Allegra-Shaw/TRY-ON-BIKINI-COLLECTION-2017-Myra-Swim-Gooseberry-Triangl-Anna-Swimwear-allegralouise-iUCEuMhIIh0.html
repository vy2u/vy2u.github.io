not naked I am wearing shirt today I'm
going to do my bikini video this video
is super requested and the point of this
video is to help you buy somewhere
online excitement Cena Styles all up it
stuff so I have done one of these in
2015 I did do one of these in 2016 as
well and I still do have a lot of those
bikini ins but a lot of them aren't
available anymore so I thought while I
was in this video if you can't buy them
all these bikinis are available now and
super on-trend hot for the 2017 season
I'm first gonna start with my
measurements I am 5 6
I am 118 pounds I have the 30 to be /c
chest
depending on the bra but they both fit
my waist is a 24 and my hips are like a
23 23 and a half I know why hips at all
but I have a little bit of a booty and
that kind of makes them like my booty
goes out not this way but like this way
you know I mean those are my
measurements and I hope it helps you out
so let's just get right into this one
the first Brendon may be talking about I
have been working with and they are Ana
swimwear you probably seen them all over
Instagram the rating students are so
cute I mean like insanely low of them
the nice thing is when whereas you can
buy like a full set and I feel like
that's not really like something that
you can do often anymore you buy like a
piece and you can buy individual pieces
on their website but I like that you can
buy the full set their colors are super
nice and the quality is amazing I'm very
very impressed with the swimwear
and it's pretty affordable for like a
full bikini discuss $115 I think that's
like super affordable for really good
quality beautiful bikini that you're
going to get tons of wear of the first
one I'm going to talk about is Vesta
meet a set in melon and this color well
it's so on trend and I just love the
bando style I got this in an extra small
the top and the bottom whole set extra
small and it fits really really nicely
it stays up it's like really flattering
top is just normal bando style really
nice and then the bottoms are
a little bit cheeky a buck a little bit
cheeky but really nice I bought these in
extra small as well just really cute I
love or I love this bikini what I think
might be one of my favorites the second
one is the Ainsley set in blush
so the easily says I really really like
the style some point where I think I
might pick it up in black it's just a
classic minimalist like pink style and
then the bottoms are song bottom I
really really like this for tanning fits
me really well I got extra small and
with the top on the bottom
the thing with Anna's swimwear is it's
all limiting run of styles and colors so
if you see something you want you better
pick it up you really want this block
though really like this again super nice
if you have bigger boobs the top size of
this because my boobs barely business so
if you're like my size but your boobs
are bigger like your 32d you should
definitely get a small on the top super
cute bikini the next one is the model
I'm set to and this is my prettiest
bikini for sure the bottoms are more
full coverage it's in the blush color as
well and I like that I bought these two
both in the blush color so I can hunt it
if your change the bottom and the top so
you know like change them up really
flattering you can visit the title
bottom that you can make like go like
this and more high cut which I like and
then the top is this is a photo is this
really pretty like feminine girly talk
with these arm dangling arm sleeves it's
super super pretty the only ones a top
is I should have bought a small in this
top it fits like it fits great but I
feel like my boobs are kind of spilling
out a little bit so I probably want to
size up in this top if I did it again so
just keep that in mind with buying this
talk it's like the prettiest little
bikini so those were three some Anna's
swimwear I do have a coupon code for you
it's a library so if used Allegretto
you'll get 10% off your bikini or anyone
while shopping with a coupon code the
only way that shop honey lots of
tomatoes from where I highly recommend
you check them out is and loving their
bikinis definitely most
our bikinis of this season okay on to
the next I wanted to show you some
one-piece bathing suits because I've
been getting into one pieces a lot and I
think they're really really flattering I
got the same bikini in two different
colors it's from gooseberry swim first
you see this one on my Instagram it's
the seafoam green color this is this so
chic bikini and I got it in a size small
it's me
absolutely perfectly this is a really
thick material you feel very like sucked
in and comfortable it's super flattering
on the booze for me and also on the butt
and the waist I just really think this
is a super flattering bikini and color
when you're tan
really nice and I also picked it up in
black I haven't worn this one yet but
just feeling it it's a lot thinner than
the green one I don't know it's that the
color thing or it's tough like the newer
version of them so I think I'm up about
four months apart but it's not
see-through at all it's just a lot
thinner but I think it's super
flattering like one of the nicest one
pieces I've seen so it doesn't just
those if you're looking for some good
one pieces the next rating to it was
like one of those purchases that I was
on vacation and I picked it out because
I was in like that vacation has bathing
like this it looks so great in Italy oh
my god but then I go fat and like some
really and we're going to wear this also
a little bit too big for me so I don't
really know what I was thinking
but I'm sure I'll get some use out of it
on like another vacation so this is a
high-waisted bean it's a cute little
stripe very not me but I think it's very
like coast of Italy Greece sort of
bikini so high-waisted like this I just
feel like this high waist cut isn't
super flowering on me like this specific
high waist cut or maybe it's because
it's a bit too big I don't know the talk
is super flattering though it's more of
this like in the triangle top that is
really close together so it kind of
creates almost like a bulk in that sort
of style but it's just really cute
striped Mohini is from the brand the
coast Capri and if I find online I'll
link it down below but I did get this at
a little shop in Positano
so I got inside small I should have got
an extra small but they didn't have it
the next bikini is my newest bikini and
it's from Myra swim and just to let you
know I got killed with duties when this
came to Canada like I peed like $80.00
beauties which kind of stuff but the top
so this is the top you can't not be able
to tell this is the top and these are
the bottoms they're high-waisted and
this is a nicer cut on me for sure they
look way more flattering but what I like
about the top is that it's very full
coverage so you can wear it as a shirt
you can wear it this way and then I also
think it looks really good backwards so
you'll see in the clip I like it both
ways I think it looks really chic and
think about going in a San Tropez when I
say like that San Tropez in September so
this is definitely bikini that I would
bring because it's like super chic and I
love it
so I don't feel too bad about the duties
because I really think the top I can get
a lot of use out of it but it kind of
sucks that I have to get do these other
than that good quality really nice
bikini opening in a small because they
only do small and medium and large top
is a little bit big but until they make
it work you can also get this talk on
like something similar on Daniel queasy
oh and Sahara right it's hard once it's
its oldest and the Marwan is cheaper I
think the last bathing suit is from
triangle I am waiting on another bikini
from triangle so if it comes before this
video goes up I will insert a clip of it
right here
the beginners you have is one of my
favorites it's a great painting bikini
and I think it's really like
fashion-forward bikini so it is this
nude velvet the key it's always friend
wearing this on snapchat and I was like
I have to have this this is so cute
looks like this not super cheeky bottom
but can make some cheeky if you need
velvet news material and then top is
like a straight sort of straight across
like tiny little top I got both these
pieces in an extra small if you a bigger
Gupta me you need to get a silo
look how tiny this is I have to like
squeeze my little boobies in here but it
gives me good cleavage so cute this is
like a perfect handing bikini like the
perfect shape from it and I just really
like it it's really cool and I fit so
