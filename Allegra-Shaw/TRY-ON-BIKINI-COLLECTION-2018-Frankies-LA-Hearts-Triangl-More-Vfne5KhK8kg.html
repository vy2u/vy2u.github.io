bikini all is finally here which means
it's summer I'm so excited honestly like
it's finally it's end of May finally
warmed up in Toronto so summer is here
which means summer videos feel like last
year when I did this video is way more
tanned but I guess it went Italy last
year anyway um this video is to help you
buy bikinis online or buy bikinis in
general and my thoughts my opinions and
sizing if you're offended by a woman's
body you might want to clip out of this
video because I'm gonna be trying the
bikinis on let's just get into it I'm
gonna give you my sizes I am five six I
like since last year my boobs have
shrunk I went off birth control so my
boobs are a little smaller my waist is a
twenty four twenty four point five hips
are like a 33 I think and that's all I
really need to give you body's pretty
proportionate don't have like super long
legs don't have super long torso it's
kind of like I'm only showing you the
bathing suits that I didn't show in last
year's video honestly I haven't watched
last rizvi do since last year so it
could be some overlap but these are the
ones that I think are the newest if you
want to see like other bathing suits I
have you know three other videos from
three previous years as I do this video
every year I realize that I'm a hoarder
same as last year for this video I have
teamed up with Ana's swimwear and they
sent me three bikinis I really love
their bikinis they are super good
quality and it's an Australian brands
like you know Australians know how to
make good bikinis they're literally
mohini's all the time okay I bought some
different styles this year I feel like
now that I'm older and I'm not so
obsessed with like getting a good tan
I'm really I'm more willing to try
different styles of bathing suits I'm
not so concerned about like having the
best hands the first meetings that I got
from in this room is a one-piece and
it's orange
I like this color especially with blonde
hair but I honestly feel like this would
look good on basically every skin tone
especially if you have a dark skin tone
I think this would look like just
absolutely stunning it's such a pretty
orange color one-piece high neck and
then the back is like lace-up low back
very cheeky like thong style I really
think I mean I think this would look
good if you have big boobs but I really
like this style for when you have small
smaller boobies
because I kind of like presses them in
and then gives you some nice like side
cleavage on me anyway I think it's
really flattering obviously you look
good a good fake boobs Jimmy feel like
everything kinda looks good you know
bigger bigger boobs I feel like everyone
wants if they can have great quality I
would actually really love this bathing
suit in black so Anna swimwear if you
want to make this baby soon black I
think this would be so flattering so
this is the Christie bathing suit in the
color melon and I got this one in an
extra-small the next meeting suit is
this banjo style bathing suit it is just
black goes right across I really like
the style of aiding suit for my body
type as well but if she really think
these bottoms are super flattering
they're less cheeky I actually just got
these so I haven't wasn't them in the
water yet less cheeky then the other
than the full piece but I really like
these I like to put kind of pull them up
higher this is the tsamina set and got
in black and I got these pieces in an
extra small this is gonna be a bikini
that I'm definitely gonna like just have
with me like all the time it's gonna be
on those jeans I just like throw on you
know and then the last set is this
Madeline set I got this last year in
pink I have that same you know set in
orange as well in the melon color but I
got the Madeline set which is kind of
like a more feminine set house like a
sweetheart neckline and then it ties
around your arms these kind of thicker
bottoms which I like to pull up as well
like you know higher I got this one in
as small because I remember last year I
got to have this in pink and the extra
small was just too tight around my bust
area so I got the small and it fits
really well I really like it I think
it's like a different sort of silhouette
that I don't see too often and it's more
I think pretty then the other one I feel
like a little more sporty you know I
mean so what that this one got a small
and that's the model and set a Havana
swimwear I had three pieces from last
year and I think they have really good
quality keys that last like mine still
look brand-new from last year the sets
are like 120 dollars which I
think it's too bad for a really good
quality Keaney especially if you get
like a nice black bikini it can last you
for a long time they do have some pretty
colors they have like pinks and melon
have this new seafoam color that is I
think stunning as well
love the bikinis definitely think it's
worth it next evading suit is from
revolve and it's from the brand oh gosh
oh my god I can't find the brand oh it's
right here
Tularosa one of those bikinis that are
one of those bathing suits bets it's
really hard to show what it looks like
on okay so it's a one-piece I think the
print is stunning it's a little bit
small for me
this was gifted to me at her vol
festival and this was the only size left
but I just couldn't pass up this like
beautiful print I think this will just
look like stunning in like you know
Italy ties up in the front and then it
ties up has this tie it's really nice I
got an extra extra small but I would
normally get as extra small I think this
is really like nice mature bikini I
think would look beautiful in
photographs and like Italy you're like
France or next bathing suits are I'm
sure the one pieces I guess I'm really
on a one-piece binge and are from LA
hearts which is a Pakistan brand I
ordered these online and this is in size
extra small and so one piece I actually
get Instagram in this we haven't seen
that I think it's nice
I like it a lot I wish it was like a
little tighter it's a little it's not
like loose but it's not like super tight
and I think I wish it was a little more
cheeky that's just like my personal
preference but I honestly think this is
a really good like family bathing suit
like a bathing suit that you can wear
around your family and it's not a big
deal it's like not super sexy or
anything so this is definitely a nice
cottage bathing suit for me they like
the little print and I think it's just
cute I think this would also be really
cute if it was ribbed next bathing suit
is also from Le hearts extra small I
really like the bottoms I think they're
really girly and cute not super cheeky
or anything just like a standard bottom
and then the top it's like a like a
triangle with the is like a bra kind of
it back triangle and
the frills the bottom I like it um it's
not like the most flattering on me
it was super inexpensive and I think
Alec Li hearts has a lot of really cute
bikinis that aren't super expensive so
you're looking for affordable options
there's a ton of affordable options on
PacSun I bet I think it's cute yes I
think it might look better if you have
just like a little more going on in the
movie area
next is waves in the wild this was
actually gifted to me and it's a startup
company in from Toronto always into
helping people in Toronto and it's this
really nice ribbed pink sort of bikini
it's like a salmon it's like a salmon
really cute I think it's super
flattering on the top is a is that like
bra style I like the ribbing a lot yeah
I got this in a small small trauma start
up so thank you so much for gifting this
mean because I'm really into it
the next friend is triangle they always
give me a ton of bikinis throughout the
year so yeah I actually don't know if
this was in my haul last year my bikini
collection last year I can't remember
when they gave us to me this is the
Allegra bikini this is not a lot of
fabric I got this a little too small it
just covers my nipples basically it's
yellow
I don't think this one's available I
know they have one that's similar on the
website have a lot of instagrams in this
bikini I think it's so flattering and
cute that I got it in another print I
also got it in this blue print which
this one is still available love this I
think it's super flattering on they got
an extra column in the yellow bikini in
both pieces but since the top was just a
little too small I ended up getting a
small in the blue and an extra still on
the bottom some extra small and then a
small in triangle bando tops but in all
their other talked to them an extra
small so just be careful with sizing
this is a note I guess also big on the
banjo this isn't
banjo style it's a thicker band no this
is when I definitely could have gone an
extra small because de bando is way more
thick than the other one its ribbed it's
white it's pretty and then the bottoms
are different than the other bottoms
they're a little more low waisted but
very nice this is a neoprene material
where the other ones aren't the other
ones aren't neo creep god is small in
top and extra small in bottoms although
it could have sized down to an extra
small in this top love a good white
bikini though you know look the last one
I'm having mr. Graham on this as well
and this is a red and white striped
neoprene bikini I really like the print
on this one and the top is very
different it is the it's a cup top and I
got this one and an extra small I think
I could have sized up to small but like
again I'd rather it be too small than
too big I think it's really flattering
on kind of gives you those vintage vibes
word in Miami and absolutely loved it
showed this bikini in a hole before but
wanted to just reshow it - it's from
Myra swim and it's their high-waisted
black bottom I actually got it to wear
with this t-shirt but I wanted to let
you know that this is not a bathing suit
t-shirt it's just a normal t-shirt but I
love a good high-waisted bottom and
these ones are super high waisted they'd
go like right to my belly button or my
belly buttons really high on my body so
it's hard to cover very expensive and
you get hit with duties so just be
careful with that I will link some of
more affordable options that you may not
get hit with Judy's down below but I
love a good high-waisted bottom for the
summer I feel like just love a good
highways to bottom in general I think
they're like really flattering so she's
like I don't have like a big like hip to
hip to waist ratio liking I don't have a
big waist to hip ratio it's kind of it's
a little more straight so I think
highways they bob was kind of like cinch
in my waist and like make it look like I
have hips which I'm into why do I was do
this video not the videos now the next
is szabo skirt bikini and I got this one
in an extra small let me just make sure
ya thought this is an extra small and
this is pretty plaid spot like gang pink
gingham style tie bottom and that same
sort of like
let style top I think the color is
really pretty on this I wear this in
Miami
I think it's flattering and pretty it's
not super like structure or anything
it's definitely one of those like flimsy
bikinis doesn't have any padding in the
top so it's kind of one of those one of
those it came to me feel like I'm really
like natural you know like I'm I'm just
like kind of wearing nothing Sabbath
suit has some really cute styles right
now some good patterns that I haven't
really seen other places okay next is
this a horror a swim bikini and this was
or it's a one-piece this was kind of
like I saw an Instagram picture of this
girl wearing like a white one piece and
it looked so good on her that I like
kind of just bought one without really
thinking and this does not look good on
me I think if you have big boobs this
would look amazing on you but this
neckline just really doesn't look good
it also kind of gates so it makes me
look really flat not flattering back is
really low so if you if you have more of
a chest think that this would look
really pretty I love I love the color
you know I like it but I just doesn't
looks about good on me you got an extra
small I think yeah I got an extra small
on this one sad because actually I guess
I'm I think I could create some really
cool content in this but it doesn't look
good the next one I'm really excited
about I just picked this one up and is
Franky is I've never bought a Frankie's
bikini before so I picked this looks
white on camera but it's a pink
how does like a 90s feel to it and it's
like a tankini oh my god I had so many
tankinis growing I was like instead of
wearing a one-piece my mom would like
bought me tankinis really cute so they
should remind me of that and then the
bottoms are basically like I just a
full-on thumb very very cheeky very
vagina E I like it singing one over on
my family but I like it and I just think
it's really cute piece I let I like the
tankini think but this like if a top
hits me here it's a little more
flattering I'm kind of again gives me a
waist which is all the rage right now
big small waist big hips I don't have
yeah I like the color I think it's
really girly and cute and good quality
never had a Frankie's bikini before I
understand these are more expensive but
the quality is really there and the last
bathing suits are from minimalist swim
so have three of these black one and
then these two colors very affordable
bikinis this is also a Toronto brand I'm
pretty sure could be wrong but I think
it is and this is the bottom got them in
a small unless it comes with small
medium large I like this kind of style
of bottom I like to like hike them up
like that the top is very minimal again
men with swimwear very minimal just a
triangle kind of bra top so this is
definitely the most flattering shape on
me the triangle halter is like for sure
the most flattering on my body type but
I like to play around with styles so
this isn't the blush color this is in
it's like a gray I'm not sure what the
name is a little up site but this is
like a gray blue same sort of style and
they're really let me just look at that
actually there are seven be $70 $69.99
so that's it for my bikini 2018
collection I have so many bikinis it's
disgusting and summer in Toronto is
literally two months so all of these are
very unnecessary but I like to pretend
money believe in a hot place up special
sorry there was a dog on a balcony got
really distracted make sure you follow
me on Instagram that's where you can see
all these bikinis in action and that's
where I connect to do the most and I
kind of puts away elegance other than
that thing yes smart watching I really
appreciate it peace love love you all
bye
