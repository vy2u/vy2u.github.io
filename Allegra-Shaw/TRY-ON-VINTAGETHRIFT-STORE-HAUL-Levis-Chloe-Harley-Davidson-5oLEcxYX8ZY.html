this whole video last night and didn't
work so great okay hi welcome back to my
channel what's up I'm like you're new
here what's up thanks for watching and
doing us really really have been
requesting thrifting videos I've been
thrifting forever like literally since I
was a child and I didn't really know
that people want to see how many -
because you can't like buy things and I
thrift I thought there is kind of like
no point to it the last you guys want to
see it so I did a whole video on the
thrift shop de vintage shop day and it's
like a followed me around vintage
shopping it'll be linked in the cards
probably at the end of this video as
well but I give you my tips on how to
have like the best day while you're busy
shopping when to go when finished shorts
get their stock in what to look for
prices all that stuff I have a full
video on that so you check that if you
want the first place I'm gonna talk
about is called public but no first I'm
gonna talk about is called House of
vintage in Toronto it's a very curated
store and I got some things first thing
I got are these pair of this pair of
black Levi's jeans this is actually what
I was looking for when I went they're
not exactly what I wanted but I can
definitely make them work I really find
it hard to get jeans because I'm small
they usually don't have my size so when
I finally if it's me I buy it these are
just black high waisted Levi's jeans
they have a zip fly yeah I don't really
like with them is the leg is a little
long and wide for me but last night I
wore them cuffed like this I think
that's really in style but what I'm
gonna do is I'm actually gonna cut them
right here and I'm gonna make like a
flared crop pants out of them but I
think that'll look really good and
they're flattering ish they're like a
vintage style Jean they were $20 $25
between that host a vintage a really
really great next thing you know I
actually got another pair of pants and
these aren't jeans and they I saw them
and I was like oh these look like
they'll fit I should try them on and I
did and
look great so these are a Korg a blue
cord pretty in style cords are really in
style they have a straight sort of like
they'd look really good like a blouse
actually my tribe tonight
a blood foots and like high-heeled boots
and a belt you guys look really nice
they're pretty cute on the button
I think these again we're like 20 to 25
dollars carry over exactly I think the
tag there's no tag on them so when I
find something up in the store that fits
me I usually just buy especially if it's
I'm currently pants and diamond because
I I don't come across denim that fits me
quite often had to pick those pairs up I
can also crop the black ones and shorts
if the capri doesn't work the next thing
which I was so happy I picked up it
actually was on pulled I tried it on and
then I went to pass register and she was
like this is action on hold so sorry
blah blah it's calming later that day
just like the person never came so you
saw yours
it is just a long-sleeve Harley shirt no
I don't ride motorcycles but I never
wear shirts of bands that I don't hear
their songs but I'm happy wearing the
Harley shirt because I guess I don't
know sorry if you ride motorcycles and
want to hate and you hate me for wearing
Harley shirt I totally understand I I
hate myself too anyway so this I this is
something I actually went in wanting I
wanted a long-sleeve white vintage shirt
didn't care what was on it so I got it
which is crazy and it's exactly what I
wanted it's a size medium and I think
it's like perfect for summer throwing on
Cod a jean shorts
converse like a really easy kind of
grungy outfit very it's that that's all
I got at house of vintage and then
before I go to public butter public
butter is definitely like a less curated
vintage store but still kind of period I
feel like they have just like everything
it's a really cool store in Toronto to
Parkdale
in their first store in a thrift video I
give you like a list of my favorite
vintage sources well the downbar
so the first thing I got was this
vintage t-shirt and it was $15 but I
think they're having a sale that day
sometimes actually end up being cheaper
but it's just this vintage tea in a size
it says large but it's not a large as
his performance in port
and then it has a Porsche on the back of
a vintage t-shirt I love the decision
was over my hardly vintage t-shirt all
the time so putting one into my
collection is great and it's really
destroyed and disgusting so just how I
like it
next thing I actually bought this for
st. Patrick's Day and when someone saw
this in the video they were like oh this
is my town this jackets from my town I
guess it's a town in Lake Ontario or
something or Canada but it's just this
green and yellow bomber vintage that's
not a bomber as a coach jacket actually
this was $40 but I think it was 60 per
Tom so it's really cheap I think it was
or maybe is 50% off however it says
Saints st. Patrick's the same okay who's
missing I'm guessing with some sort of
like sports jacket goodness belong to
broomball so I thought this is really
good for Saint Patrick's Day I don't
know if I'll ever wear this after st.
Patrick's Day but I thought this would
be a really good little outfit to wear
for st. Patrick's Day
so I got it pair mom jeans pair of like
a t-shirt just a white t-shirt vans
great same hunter say outfit because I
just can't look good on st. Patrick's
Day I'm gonna be like day drinking and
just it's all I'm gonna wear I have to
wear flats and kind of look good to G
because yeah the drinking is just a
nightmare the next thing I want is
called MSU vintages of all Dayton is
actually more like a designer
consignment shop I got the nicest pieces
ever I was so lucky they had the most
Moodle pair of Gucci pants too with it
for me miss her on me is a shirt that I
got a little wrinkly I've kind of been
throwing around but it's a Chloe shirt
Chloe this is Chloe I got this
secondhand very I'm really excited about
it it's beautiful
it is a size 38 so it's a bit bigger
than I would normally get but it fits
really well I don't know if this is
supposed to be a shirt a size 30 it's
like makes the dress on me I really
don't know I don't care it looks so good
belted
it's just like the nicest most beautiful
thing ever has like embroidery and I'm
just I'm in love with that I got this
for I think two hundred and seventy
dollars I'm not sure how much it is
retail but it all right let's see oh my
god yeah I would fucking deal
okay so the most basic dress I can find
is just the cheapest price is within
$1,600 I didn't realize Chloe
dresses for the six one thing I feel
myself sweating right now anyway I'm
guessing this was around 1500 to 2500
dollars normally it's beautiful so thank
you and miss you vintage I love the last
thing I got is another t-shirt I reduced
all the time wearing one right now
they're just I just go I just love them
so I got this Maison kitsune t-shirt and
Binda Maison kitsune in Paris and get
anything t-shirts are you're pretty
excited everything they're over 100 and
this was $50 and it's size large but I
think it'll look really good if I wash
jeans tucked in half tucked into a shirt
with a blazer heels boots flats anything
I just love the phones have all the
colors and it's a really nice thick
beautiful t-shirt and I'm into shirts
that's everything I got in my little
thrifting adventure I hope you guys
