the lighting in my apartment so don't
judge me but I thought I felt against
this blue wall because I painted this
wall myself and I'm very proud of it it
didn't do the best job but it looks nice
okay so I thought that I could do a
mascara video which I want to call the
great mascara off and I think I want to
do this with like a bunch of other
products do you think it's like a really
cool idea um so basically in my January
favourites I asked you guys I told you
that I love the L'Oreal telescopic
mascara and I asked you guys that Nicki
if you knew it by the other great
lengthening mascaras because I was
relieved so skating length in my
eyelashes because I have a lot of
eyelashes they're just so long anybody
you meet so many suggestions so I went
to Walmart and choppers and I picked up
basically all the mascara cigar
suggestions that Becca basically all the
mascara that you guys suggested other
than a few that I couldn't find anywhere
and and then I picked up some other ones
or I just all looked interesting so yes
under some of the ones that I didn't
necessarily love and then I'm going to
get into the ones that I love and then
I'll tell you the winner at the end the
first one is the Maybelline Great Lash
mascara I feel like this mascara is
Oscar at you buy like your first mascara
I know this was my first mascara Hedison
clear another autumn
and those are my first month I was my
first mascara I was other a lot of to
buy so this is like a great just like
very natural mascara but it does not
give the length that I liked or that I
wanted the brush is really tiny which is
good but honestly just didn't really do
what I wanted to do so sucks but that
did not work out for me the next one
this one I really really didn't like
this is the Almay one coat get up and
grow and it claimed to be their
lengthening mascara so I got it in black
and okay first of all the brush is huge
and like for lengthy my scare away the
brush amazing huge it just was like
massive and the hormones really wet and
I don't really love when formulas are
super wet so my lashes just looked like
really bad and like clunky and like tiny
like very small so this was no this
wasn't look that this was just a no for
me um also I forgot to mention that I
did not use an eyelash curler for any of
these because I really wanted to see
like what it did to my actual eyelashes
okay so the next one is the Ramona lash
accelerator with mascara mascara with a
grow large complex um this one that was
okay it was again really wet and I kind
of got it all over my face the brush
wasn't bad but I just think it's like
not really worth it um and I'll have of
crisis late whatever not the best but
not a whole it kind of looked a little
messy on my face I feel like so it's
really like that um the Clinique
highlights mascara was the most
this brush was crazy I got this one in
brown black in black brown the brush is
like crazy nervous iam mascara brush
like this but I did like it but I was
this was the first one I tried and I was
comparing everything to the L'Oreal
telescopic because I know that I love
that one and this one is good but the
telescope it was better and this one is
more expensive so you know like I would
always see go for the cheaper one but I
do really I actually did like this one a
lot it's just the price was kind of like
why would I buy this when I could buy
the telescopic but as you can see lame
eyelashes look really long formula was
not super wide it was perfect it was
it's a good it's a great mascara so um
yeah he won't like a higher-end mascara
to Clinique highlights muskers is really
good so the next one are these ugly
Maybelline one this is the Maybelline
illegal length
fiber extensions and the oh this is
waterproof
hey waterproof mascara and this is the
lash Salette oh and honestly these are
basically the same they have the same
brush for me was pretty much the same I
don't think I would be able to tell the
difference between these two so they're
good and actually wearing the lash
stiletto on my eyelashes right now
and they yeah it's good it's okay not
great but not awful if you feel me
okay not many it's the ones that I like
are absolutely us with and I think that
these are really worth the money
above all the mascaras feel like higher
end ones really didn't work the best
night
I never thought that higher end mascaras
and Lauren massacres was like a
difference but they really weren't and
benefit knows how to make a good mascara
Wow
okay so I bought the benefit roller lash
because this is like talked about all
over YouTube and all of you guys were
saying like how great it is and what you
love it and it's amazing you guys are
right this is a great mascara it the
brush is nice the formula is great it
made my lashes really slick long and
wispy and like everything I really
wanted so I love this mascara and the
only problem is it's like $30 Canadian
um and like I just really want to send
them a 20 on the mascara so that's only
downside but um this is a great mascara
good call you guys amazing so the next
one is the veil real benefit they are
real this is the tinted primer on the
actual mascara I've used an Oscar before
it's a great mascara it's very similar
to the Royal lash line i feel kind of
good just like the same effect
I love the rule wash to curl your lashes
I don't only know about that but gives
like the same important sort of eyelash
effect but I don't think they're real
tinted primer in brown because during
the day like I don't love to I don't
need to be made up all the time so I
want to like a good round mascara so
this primer is great just wear on its
own I think it makes your eye look
really pretty and natural and um they
spread out and whatever and then I also
think it's an amazing primer and it does
create more length I'm wearing the
primer underneath Neal sloshed a little
on this I decide I think yeah um so I
think this is really great if you're
looking for Locke's primary think this
is really nice and it's also nice to
wear
it's own so you kind of get double usage
out of bats because normally lock
primers are white and you can't really
wear the one on your own on their own
sorry um so yeah I think the benefit did
primer is great to wear under but
honestly I can't we live in through all
the struggle the L'Oreal telescopic
mascara is the best mascara for the
price for what it does it's just the
best one I I love it more than all of
them and I think that if you are looking
for a mascara that gives your lashes
length and makes them like wispy and
long the telescope because the best one
we've used this one I use the carbon
block and they're both amazing
so I can't live I went through all that
trouble to realize that I love the same
last scary but it was cool try it was
cool to see different brushes um i the
Clinique one was really cool so I mean I
have tons of mascara now I would
probably give some of them away but uh
yeah so I'm going to say these are the
best ones roller wash be they're real
and I think that need their real to do
partner with me they're real mascara
would be insane I think that'd be a
great combo and L'Oreal telescopic are
the best mascaras for lengthening that I
tried and I think this is a Clinique
high lengths mascara is a close second
and all these other ones I don't think
are worth it so that is all I hope you
guys enjoyed this sort of like review
video I have a really ever done this
before I would love to do this with the
other kind of products I was thinking
doing to do moisturizer so I feel like
it's hard to find a good tintin
Dreiser so I want to do them with
products that are like I don't want to
do foundations because I feel like
foundations are so personal but I think
it's a good moisturizer is very
different and not that personal or like
I don't know I don't know if you have
any suggestions there if you like this
video and wrong search for answers would
be a good one to learn a if you
have any suggestions or if you like this
video please give it the thumbs up
please subscribe to my channel and yeah
I hope you guys enjoy this video I will
talk to you soon and thank you for
