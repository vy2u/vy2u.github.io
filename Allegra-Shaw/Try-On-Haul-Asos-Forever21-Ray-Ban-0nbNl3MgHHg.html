single thing or like most of it I've
worn a lot I just could I couldn't wait
okay so the first thing that I got is
the is the new look beaded turquoise arm
cuff it helped us be really pretty for
festival season um you just like slip it
on your arm it dangles down super pretty
this was 18 dollars and seven cents
Canadian I actually haven't worn this

Shaya the next thing is a three pack of
rings and I actually lost one of the
Rings because I was wearing these every
day it is the ASOS curve pack of three
hands adjustable rings but it came with
an evil eye a hamsa hand and also came
with a cactus little cactus and I lost
the cactus because that was my favorite
one you guys know I love cactuses and it
just fell off my finger I got ball and
yeah very sad very sad
this was also $18 seven cents which is
pretty amazing eighteen dollars and
seven cents for three rings is pretty
great the next thing is this belt I wore
this I got ball as well and I love this
belt the only thing is I got a small and
icon which I got but I got a medium just
because I wanted this to like hang down
like it fits but I wanted it to hang
down more it is called the reclaimed
vintage Western studded boyfriend belt
um and it was only 34 dollars which is
pretty good and I think it looked really
great my outfit also look brave just in
a black outfit and kind of just like
spices it up you know the next thing is
may also work up a lot shaggy we're at
Ivy Wade shrine where because I hate
having a bag it is just uh just this
it's just a so soft unlined backpack
this was $45.98 just a black leather
backpack it was really great to have the
bus folks we just roll more stuff in
there are cameras and sweaters and
whatever we needed and we'd have to
really worry about honey bag so sure
sure in for wearing this the whole time
ago Bowl on too close I got this 2-pack
of t-shirts this is a Zoe's ultimate
easy tees this is the black one and this
is the they've got a white one as well
you can give them in packs of one two or
three I got the tubes I want to block
and white and you save like 10% if you
you know buy the pack so it was perfect
I love black and white tees just wear
t-shirts all the time so
perfect for that and then the last thing
that I got from ASOS is this is off the
shoulder with ruffle detail shirt I wear
this I cobalt as well if you can see
that oh yeah it smells and it just sits
off the shoulder it's super pretty
really feminine but since the block is
still kind of like edgy um I really love
this shirt was super comfortable to wear
I just didn't wear a bra with it and it
has this like ruffle detail over top I
it was like perfect amazing shirt
this one was 3615 not bad at all I use
everything from ASOS so the next door is
forever 21 I actually haven't worn this
yet but I was wearing at my friend's
applied on the weekend and it was
destroyed so they don't actually destroy
this one as well but this is from
forever 21
actually the men's section I bought in
size medium it was $26.90 and they just
wanted an oversized plaid shirt so just
looks like this you know standard plaid
I am going to destroy it I think a
little bit because I really liked the
way my friends looked um yeah $26.00
pretty good
Oh mrs. Lisa sausage was this on sale I
think this was actually on sale for 19
which is even better so that was from 41
and then I got I really love this I got
this from the bay and it's the Calvin
Klein is a little wrinkly because it was
in my suitcase but it's just a Calvin
Klein bralette might be a little dirty
too um but it's just this little white
bralette and really nice to like wear
under things we're gonna crop things

grams to like you know what this looks
like and it was pretty
pensive I think it was like $20 and I
