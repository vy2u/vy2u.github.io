oregano colloidal silver echinacea and
lemon my whole mouth is on fire but it
was so good
this will I'm not gonna be sick ever if
I drink this just got into a Facebook
fight with some privileged white man who
was talking about how there's no racism
to the states made me
livid I never get involved on Facebook
things because it's like what's the
point but I could not help myself so I
went off on him because I'm mature I
just left the in-center
I got some
I actually think I'm done Christmas
shopping
I just have to like go pick up one more
thing but I think I'm dying for
something pretty happy but I think I got
great gifts for everyone always on to
get some booze for hosting Christmas I'm
like shutting down for the holidays so
I'm gonna take I'm gonna take Friday

other than vlogging obvious so vlog okay
this person driving very slowly and then
I'll be back back in it on Boxing Day
just reading some stuff on acne because
this is like this is insane I've had
this since the first day of vlogmas and
it's just I I really just hate it so I
was just reading this stuff because it's
obviously not a real zit it's like a
cyst it's like a cystic sit and I was
just reading some stuff about it and I
found this product and it's actually for
cystic acne it's called Renee rule Oh

and it supposed to actually like go down
to layers of skin it's just crazy

biggest pain-in-the-ass ever I'm gonna
link this product down below for you so

available on the market so I'm guessing
it's not a lot of there's not a lot so
I'll link it down below and hopefully it
can help some of you out because I've
been struggling with cystic acne for my
whole life
happy vlogmas day 22 i'm gonna have this
little digestion shot and I have some
orders to pack up and then I have to go
to the printers to pick up some stuff to
restock the jean jackets off to pick up
the jean jackets and yeah shrinks home
today so probably see her maybe um guess
what work to do my lips are so dry
because I'm so dehydrated but so
randomly still dry yeah happy yeah oh I
really would like some food I don't have
anything I have
these Ron bananas an onion and I'm
pretty sure that Tomatoes probably run
running pretty low on clementines and
then let's go over the fridge pretty
empty so meet some food Oh chin up gave
me this mask it's a 30 minute face mask
but you like put it you like put it
under here to stop this term like
sagging not that really like I don't
really have that but you can see kind of
I don't really have it I don't know why
I'm like trying to force it I don't
really how about what some people do it
looks pretty complicated and I'm off I
should do it now or later
oh it comes with two it says
non-surgical face book so if you have
like it doesn't mean you're fat or
anything it just like you know some
people have just like a boy go so they
can have like a double chin so what you
do is you like measure and then you cut
it and then you strap it on and then you
put this belt over I don't feel like
doing it no I'll do later but I thought
it's really cool I wanted to I'll try
the digestion shot ah ears ringing on
camera right
Oh
