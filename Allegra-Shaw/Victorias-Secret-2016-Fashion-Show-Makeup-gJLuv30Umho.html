so the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show is
tonight so I thought I'd recreate the
look from the show at watch them
interviews on like gotta kind of a vibe
for what they're doing this year and
it's what I came up with
I'm obsessed this look I think it's just
like super pretty and girly
um and the hair is just like toss hold I
didn't do the hair in this video but if
you want to see I just made it really
messy if you want to say here is short
Oh almost look let me know and I'll do
it other than that it's all the products
that I use this video will be linked
down below for you purchase in my
personal shop if you want to find out
how to do this look let's keep our look
just what to put okay so let's get
started who haven't done Victoria's
Secret Fashion Show looking so long okay
so this year they focused more on the
eyes than on the skin so we can just
kind of do like a really dewy easy skin
look I'm already crying into my face so
what I'm going to mix together is the
Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer and the
Urban Decay Naked skin foundation they
weren't even I washed a few interviews
and they said they're not even focusing
on being super tan or anything they just
wanted to kind of go with whatever the
girls already had going on which is nice
kind of focus on individuality or
whatever so I'm just kind of making a
concoction on my hand and then
putting so my face my beauty blender is
obviously very damp to give the most
natural appearance okay so now I'm going
to take the Maybelline instant age
rewind concealer and do the under eyes
and then I'm going to mix the Born This
Way and mix concealer together to cover
up any is it's it kind of have a few old
breakouts but if you're Victoria's
Secret Angel you probably don't need
this stuff that your skin is probably
perfect and then I'm going to take this
this is like a yellow elite this is the
Born This Way and I'm just gonna do a
little bit highlighting with a concealer
and then we're going to blend that out
with the Beauty Blender
I'm not going to set this because I want
it to be super dewy so I'm not gonna use
any powder again it's margatroid Secret
Angel and I make my face a little more
angular so use this foundation brush and
I'm gonna use this cream contour and I'm
just gonna lightly contour nothing crazy
then I have a pretty round face so I'm
just gonna kind of just do very lightly
right here then I'm going to add a
blender kind of blend it out make sure
it's not harsh and then I'm going to
take powder then I'm going to take a
powder bronzer and I'm going to take
this stippling brush just a duo fiber
brush and I'm just gonna bronze up the
face a little bit so just like a really
you know pretty natural kind of thing
going on I'm gonna move on to eyes for a
little bit um first I'm going to prime
them these Urban Decay primer potion oh
my god my little ear light just went out
so either primed put a powder over this
but you don't have to oh my god so the
eyes are pretty light with the eyeshadow
and they did a winged liner which was
kind of new they don't usually do that
and take this like dark sort of sparkly
pink from the NYC love addicts palette
dust off any excess I'm going to lightly
put this in the crease just to give the
look some depth
nothing crazy how many times I said
nothing crazy I'm going to take this
lighter sort of pink color and oops I'm
gonna take this lighter sort of sparkly
pink color and mix it with this brown
matte Brown like that taking the my
blending brush again blending it all out
okay now time for winged eyeliner we all
know how bad I am at winged eyeliner I'm
actually gonna put falsies on first and
then I'm gonna do my wing so I'm taking
the ardell demi whispies so while the
glue is just getting tacky I'm going to
throw in a small coat of mascara okay
false lashes are on its gonna let that
like fully dry before I continue with
the eyes so let's keep going with the
face so blush NARS orgasm oh god I have
and then take this bad boy and go over
it and then I'm using the t's a style
addict highlighter this is my new
favorite highlighter it's cream
highlighter and just like this pretty
yellow color it eats from T's cosmetics
so I'm just taking a little bit of my
finger it's very pigmented so ah and I'm
gonna add this as highlight because they
didn't use a lot of glitter or anything
it's kind of more of just like a sheen
down the bridge of my nose and uh left
over Justin before my eye so now what
we're gonna do is I'm going to add the
my cover FX stick on my waterline time
for winged liner um it's just a classic
wing and I have a little angled eyeliner
brush here just so I can make it a
little less harsh I'm going to try this
on camera but it's very hard to do
winged eyeliner on camera if you watch
youtube videos you would know that that
everyone finds it hard sorry this
eyelashes were very hard to put on so
I'm just going to take a highlight shade
from that same palette just like a you
know champagne Mac classic color and I'm
going to highlight my brow then I'm
actually going to add mascara to blend
that the fake washes in I'm going to add
a little bit of mass go to the bottom
and then for lips I'm using the NYX soft
matte lip cream in Istanbul and then I'm
using this luxe gloss and Angel yourself
pre thinning it's a little too pink
I just added a touch of concealer to
kind of calm down the pink and think it
worked and that is the finished look so
what you need to do now is take some
finishing spray just mess up this hair
make it Victoria's Secret II you know
