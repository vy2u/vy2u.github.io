so here's Emma I was lost and I pretty
sure every single vlog she's been in
we're just been lost so about 45 degrees
outside we're in winter jackets we can't
find the car
mother movie dad mom dad brother sister
well I will Smit like first mom Jenny
teacher mom mother's mom or dad mom or
what are the words our mom mama I'm just
doing a very casual video cuz this is
going in a vlog but I had just felt
water everywhere all over my head and
all over my books and I'm just really
pissed off I just don't know
okay so I'm gonna do just like what I
got for Christmas and this will be in my
blog so you can see what I got um the
first thing your honor this adult
coloring book um just like the
meditation coming back on these coloring
pencils from indigo just has all these
like
little pictures to color I started this
already I really thought this would be
very zen but it kind of makes me more
anxious because I wanted to look good
but yes I really like that and then I
got for my cousin I got this
tap on D shade + light contour palette
and I've been wanting this for so long
some so exciting than watching a new
tutorial with this probably tomorrow and
you know I the colors are so nice and so
so pigmented so thank you I'm afraid
that my other cousin gave me a piece of
art he does art so maybe this
masterpiece of art from any place when I
move out and I and it is so beautiful
insert a picture if I have one but it's
just like amazing so thank you I like
that I love love love that this is
actually the water that I just dropped
on my head but it's saved your saw Jay
or this like diffusers sort of thing
what makes your rooms funky and it's
like essential oils this is just a
little diffuser kit but I have like one
that's like a humidifier as well not
that's what I dropped on my head but
this one is just a little diffuser so
this will be nice and I can use this in
the meantime so that experience of
dropping out of my head does never just
not happen again
um I got this glass shadow box I'm gonna
put my jewelry in this and then I want
to get a few more just like stock and
like have a little Julie thing and then
actually my when I knew that I want to
have one of these by the door and I'm
gonna put my sunglasses in them so I
really like these I think they're really
pretty and they've all made jewelry in
this we do that after this video
actually I got these
two candles from indigo this one smells
like Lake Louise Oh smells well but
doesn't smell like Lake Louise but it's
like sense of Canada so it's like
different places this one was very very
fresh I mean I loved this one in the
spring and then this one is that like
tree woodsy scent that I love it smells
like a Christmas tree so I love these
this is going to be the one I burn in
the winter and then Lake Louise would be
the one I burned in the summer and I
really love those
you gotta to Maureen's gift card because
I love nights importance and then I got
a mason jar tumbler that is downstairs
I've already been using it so I don't
have it up here you know they'll be used
and then the last thing I got is this
camera lens so this is the Sigma 33
millimeter 1.4 for my camera and this
will be great because my videos will be
waiting nicer quality and yeah I'm
really excited um this is a lens that a
lot of youtubers use so I think that my
videos are gonna be really great I'm
gonna test it out tomorrow when I film a
tutorial so my next big video like story
I'll not vlog will be with this lens so
you can told me if you like it and that
is everything about for Christmas um
