today's video sort about my appearance
and really was not planning on filming
this video today or I was telling you
planning on doing a voiceover but I
wanted to give more context to the video
so instead of doing what I eat in a day
I wanted to give you more like an
overarching what I have been eating
during the days so you can get a better
idea that's not just like one specific
day it's kind of like what I have been
eating so the first thing in the morning
is I drink water and coffee I have been
getting Starbucks most of the days he
all can judge me down below if you want
but I have been getting start with
coffee and water almost every morning I
try to drink one of those waters it just
isn't more like in the first two hours I
wake up and that I drink a coffee and
then I have two options for breakfast if
I'm really on the go I will have a
smoothie and it'll have protein it'll
have berries it'll have all these good
nutrients that I'll be listed on the
screen
and this is a vixen smoothie and I
usually make a pretty big smoothie in
the morning to tide me over until lunch
time if I have is it more time to chill
and make breakfast I'll make avocado
toast I know this is like so
basic and you see all the time all over
YouTube but I love avocado toast and I'm
egg on top and it just really fills me
up and makes me feel good it doesn't
hurt my stomach and it's something
that's her my stomach I'll eat it all
the time because I have a very sensitive
stomach in breakfast and lunch
I don't usually snap I'm usually work
mode and do my thing so for lunch so I
usually order food if it I really don't
go to shop that much so I usually order
food and I'll get a COPI Bowl I love
pokey bowls they're my favorite this
one's from square fish
it has carbs it has fish I get the
salmon one it has vegetables it has like
everything and he's me super full again
turn my stomach and I love it so they
sums up for pokeballs
yeah love them between lunch and dinner
like really because of the day some of
them super hungry and if I wanted to not
all try to throw in some vegetables or
fruit so we'll have a banana I will have
celery and hummus I will have pita and
hummus something along those lines try
to keep it healthy I will also have a
coffee in the afternoon so for dinner
was this two options I'll cook or I will
get something takeout or go out so if I
cook this was like a summer pasta Joey
and I made together really healthy and
good
I actually don't usually path to that
lunch but this is like we just made
pasta and I happen to film it but we
cook something usually pretty healthy
together and then oven thatting usually
they get tacos of some sort so this is
Wilbur tacos is the bulgogi and the
carne asada taco and then I usually get
a little sidewalk they have good vegan
options and grand electric also has
great vegan options and good tacos in
general so that's usually where I think
we talk of Stroman some unique tacos but
not fit for my full day I usually don't
eat after dinner if I want to bear it
I'll have some like maybe some vegan ice
cream I don't like ice cream not much
but maybe something ice cream maybe I'll
have some berries try to keep it light
