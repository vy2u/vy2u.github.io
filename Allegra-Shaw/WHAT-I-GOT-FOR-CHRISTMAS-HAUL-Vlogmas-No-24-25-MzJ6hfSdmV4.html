like my house is a disaster and I
haven't wrapped any of the presents and
I'm supposed to leave ten minutes ago to
go see my family so I'm a little
stressed right now all right
update I am now in the car it's 11:30 an
hour after I was on she's supposed to
leave I am like beyond sick and every
time I sneeze I like screams it's so
frustrating there's got the tea at
Starbucks and now I'm heading up north
family's gonna be mad at me but my
friend were on and I just checked my
mail my friend Ron it got me this book
the subtle art of not giving fuck I love
it like that is the sweetest thing I
just check my mail and it was there he's
so sweet
thank you Ron if you're watching this
what you probably aren't but thank you
so much and I didn't bring us like boxes
welcome to Barrie Ontario
I found the gifts month early and then
finally show now you tell me this
he won't sit down you're like hey guys
so um I didn't really finish off Wild
West so I got so sick and I just was
like going to have my family and I also
like slept most of Christmas I was like
just a dead person so what I thought I
would do like I did last year is end off
flog miss with a what I bought for
Christmas and like what I gave for
Christmas sort of video um so I'm gonna
run through what I gave everyone for
Christmas first um to my cousin I gave
him a clocks and the colors necklace
which is just had like it was like a
chain and had a little like machete on
it and a feather it's really cool clock
Sinclar just like a Toronto ran this
plate is very bright and then my mom I
got a Rebecca Minkoff clutch and I got
her pajamas I stepped out I got him a
Canada goose like a Vader hat sort of
thing um my and uncle I got them some
uncle stuff and Shirin I got her eye
makeup palette and some sweats and
really cool sweats and my dad I don't
really do presents and yeah that was it
oh my cousin I got her a bad girl Stuart
history book and she wanted dislike shot
and vegetable chopper so that's what I
gave everyone for Christmas and now I'm
gonna run through what I got there's one
thing that I'm missing hmm should I get
it I don't know where it is oh god this
lights break the first thing is actually
what is making my eyes look like this
and it's a ring light I got the 12 inch
mini diva didn't eat diva a mini ring
wait for my mom and I was gonna try to
show you what it looks like but I don't
have a mirror
but it's just a ring light around my
camera and it is very close the camera
is very close to my face right now
so making me blind but wow it is so
powerful so from Sherman I got three
makeup products I got the lorac what is
it the lorac pro eyeshadow palette three
and it looks like that how I never used
although guess I don't know it's gonna
go so meta focus I'm very sorry um it
looks like this and it has like the best
oh I have a mirror see that ring light
house like clearly the best colors ever
I've already used a bunch of them and
they are like really pigmented and easy
to blend out I would use every single
color in this palette I think it's
really hard to find a palette that you
would use every single color but I'm
thinking about doing Indonesia look for
you guys with like these colors these
are like read everyday colors honestly
I've already used like half of them they
are amazing and such a great palette so
thanks for in um and then she also got
me the lorac pro matte lip color in
Rosewood and it's like a dark short I
was wearing it in the last clip or like
the second last clip of my last vlog -
if you checked that out
that's a Claire is wearing on my lips it
is really really pretty like it's just a
deep sort of like wine color it doesn't
last very long which is like fine for me
I feel like look Claire so mas along
with me anyway but it doesn't last very
long such a beautiful color and I feel
like just think you're kind of easy to
wear you know it's just like you swipe
it on and then she also got me the buxom
lip color in full-on lipstick in
Amsterdam which is what I'm wearing on
my lips right now I'm not sure and she
also got me on something that you can't
get in can I show me the Tarte shape
tape concealer it she did give me a
shade that is a little bit light for me
should be fair natural and I probably
needed a light natural but what I use it
for which is actually amazing is like I
just put it it is so
like pigmented and like crazy so I just
put like two dots like right underneath
my eye and then I can see all that area
and then I go in with such a bit of a
darker concealer and then I do the
highlighting but wow this is I can't
wait this comes to Canada what a great
concealer it's so much product so thank
you should really appreciate that so
