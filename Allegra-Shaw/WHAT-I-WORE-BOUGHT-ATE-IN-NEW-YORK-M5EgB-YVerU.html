gave me this little goodie I've like
ripped everything apart curious little
goodies thing and then they also have
this thing that you can like text the
hotel if you want anything instead of
calling which I'm so down because I hate
talking to people they have these cool
lighting things the shower like is in
the room which is pretty cool pretty
nice bathroom world of Kiehl's high and
they gave us all of these products I've
never tried half of these have tried
this avocado cream and this really a
really nice hotel and we always we never
bring tooth brushes we always ask for
toothbrushes at the hotels and this is a
bamboo eco-friendly toothbrush which I'm
pretty into and I think I'm actually
gonna keep that toothbrush for travels
I'm very excited to be here really
exciting my second brand trip that I've
ever done
and that's because I am socially awkward
I swear
okay we work down got ready I am wearing
this sitting there leather jacket and

Chicago they have one in New York and in
just like just it's so it's so luxe it's
so so looks like it's just such an
amazing experience and yeah we really
feel fine spending money on food good

the aviary team and Dan the executive
chef there because they like really like
