because I'm going to Osheaga and I'm
going to a wedding
they look nice they look natural just
want to try them out definitely not
gonna be like a normal thing I just had
a really weird day being in business and
being a woman who's like I didn't think
I was gonna be treated any differently I
don't know I guess I are manufacturer
treats women like shed obviously we're
not working with him anymore because he
treats women like but I just got an
email from him today that was just so
condescending and ridiculous and rude
and I just I want to know when I don't
want anyone else to go through like what
we've gone through with him because it's
insane so I got eyelash extensions they
look pretty nice and natural like them I
look so pretty right now I'm getting
ready for Osheaga so I'm going to show
you through how I prep so got my
eyelashes done I'm gonna get my nails
done and then what I do is I go through
my outfits to make sure that I have an
outfit plan for every day because I've
done a music festival before and just
brought a bunch of things and it didn't
work out very well this is one of the
outfits that I'm thinking so I'll just
put the whole outfit on and make sure it
looks good together this doesn't include
accessories I'll just do a clothes first
then I'll accessorize after I think
about wearing this princess Polly dress
with this body suit underneath that is
so cheap and does not fit me so I had to
cut it I'm probably gonna tuck it under
my bra but that looks nice right and
then I'll wear my hair natural in like
maybe little buns and then I'll
accessorize it and these are Frye boots
so that's outfit number one second
outfit I'm gonna do something like this
Jean sure it's probably fishnets or
maybe not and then I'm not gonna wear
this shirt but I'm gonna wear a cropped
Panti outfit number two okay last outfit
I am wearing this like sheer
Cammi dress with this white high-waisted
bathing suit underneath probably boots
because he gets muddy and Osheaga so
yeah you'll have to follow me on
instagram if you want to see that open
action and now I'm gonna self-tan
letting tan sent me some self tanners so
I'm gonna use some loving ten self
tanners what I'm thinking with these I
think I'm gonna use the ultra dark cuz I
have all night to let the tan sit use my
loving tan mitt obviously and then I'm
gonna use this one the day of I've never
used this before but I'll probably use
this on my legs all right so I got my 10
on what kind of muddy but that's because
I just put it on and I let it sit but I
looked dark for sure
yeah oh this is it looks so bad it just
a little mommy goes look bad in person
the kitchen's there batteries here just
cute little fireplace situation
drinks
well I look rough oh my god
yesterday was fun it rained but we saw
justice was really good and then what
does that set after pretty go backstage
pretty breakfast
and then I'm going to get ready we're
gonna go do it again but I'm gonna like
chill we're gonna watch too we're gonna
eat I'm lying in bed we tried to go over
breakfast everything was too packed and
I just like don't feel well enough just
sit in a restaurant ok human trying to
get my coffee down it's hard anyway
don't what have wall but it'd look like
this anymore so good boy okay haven't
really felt without much this trip
because I'm just kind of been like
enjoying it but I just used I want to
show you this I just used the loving tan
luminous like Brocker bronze shimmer
luminous cool my face it looks really
nice
I mean maybe doesn't look good in this
light but just kind of gives you like a
satin finish and kind of like blurs out
anything so maybe gonna put that my body
as well but I just wanna show you this
so I'm gonna get ready I didn't film any
of my outfits fer but if you want to see
what I wore uh Tasha guy you could
follow me to the scrim as a question all
the outfits on Instagram all the death
find a way to find
or to my vlog I look disgusting Oh shake
is done we're not going to well you know
day after Osheaga and I we got home
yesterday night it took us like nine
hours to drive home it was awful but so
I'm doing like a healthy detox day
because I don't feel very good after
drinking for three days so right now I'm
making a smoothie
so I put vegan protein powder if they
got one vanilla one stays like
whatever I got some honey some almond
butter blueberries almond milk a banana
and then I put in this humm neat it's
really loud outside
humm nutrition raw beauty green
superfood powder that helps boost energy
radiant skin of metabolism with raw
greens so has coconut and pineapple
fusion I didn't know if I had I
guess they're all the same so it doesn't
matter
alright well those flavors don't really
go with what I was going for but we'll
just see how it tastes
my taste like to get thrown a bit
of water and then blend up taste test
delicious tastes amazing and it's so
good for you I like to blend my
smoothies up like a lot so there's no
it's like watery see what I mean it's
like a juice almost mmm so that has a
full scoop of protein in the vegan
protein powder which has like all of
your daily vegetables and it was that
wrong interesting thing plus all this
and then what I've been loving the humm
nutrition I've just tried them out so I
take the daily cleanse one which take
two of those want to sink this person
honking outside I'm gonna freak out I
take the gut instinct which is like a
probiotic and I you have a bad stomach
so always about that probiotic I got the
omegas omegas are amazing for you miss
agree with them I always take a vitamin
D because here in Canada well in the
summer I do get enough but in the winter
as Canadians know good enough vitamin D
that is fo sho and then I have these
collagen ones which is supposed to be
like skin elasticity that was just more
of like a aesthetic thing I wanted to
try that out but I just take the daily
cleanse ones and they've got ones every
day and yeah I like them don't hurt my
stomach which is nice so this is how I
recover from like I'm crazy music fest
for like a weekend of drinking or
whatever the-- i'll do i did i woke up
this morning well
after I stopped partying or whatever I'm
doing I drink like a crazy amount of
water like I will just keep chugging
water and then this morning I woke up
and I had a hot lemon water so lemon
ginger and honey is when I put it in I
drank that and then like an hour later I
had that milkshake or that smooth
milkshake what I have that smoothie that
I showed you and now I'm just like
resting like I'll do all of my work
comfy clothes in bed just kind of like
hanging out but I'm doing work I'm not
just like Marjan movies still need to be
productive after you know I took three
days off and then I it is 12 o'clock so
I'm gonna go get a coffee soon and then
I'll probably have a salad later so I'm
just kind of like letting my body digest
and cover and recuperate cuz yeah that
was a crazy weekend picked up my tall
iced coffee and venti iced water oh god
I forgot to wash this guy's Joey hates
when I make a smoothie and then I don't
clean it out right away cuz it like
sticks to the bottom
I'm also knows my teeth I've been kind
of like gray so I got to like whiten
them but I'm gonna take my vitamins and
drink my coffee and just cleanse and
blends it away today behind the scenes
the life of a youtuber
I'm like filming and then you can like
kind of smooth but I like my boy having
a ball break
I saw that I'm like right booty pick
don't sexualize the woman's body 2017
everyone has a body
let's stop sexualizing it 2017
hey hey
Marshall too old to be filming
back-to-school books
so we're here at the ABC Studios we're
gonna customize the capillary okay we're
here at music studio and hey we're gonna
hey look it's good
yes
with leather silver hardware obviously
spikes will double check the sleeve
length
and we'll get rid of those argument
tracks yeah actually
so I have to name
I'll show you what
so there's like this royal blue
this which is really ready
it's really dark yeah
okay
okay
it's very like almost madness
yes sir
give me a spin
we're out for sushi right now and it's
like make your own sushi look at us
you
Coffee this morning and their sweetener
in it ruined my coffee Oh gross feel
kind of obnoxious going down there being
like um you put sweetener in my coffee
and I can't drink it so I'm sitting go
buy another one that's the kind of
person I am very awkward how much so
that's why I got myself a nitro free
with my three starbucks stars about this
one never owned a strapless bra before
the bras are so expensive like I oughta
brought three pairs when we're at 120
dollars what what maybe I went to
Sephora and I got I made it to vib kind
of embarrassing but whatever and then
don't mind how dirty my floor is but I
thought is giorgia no Joey Bobbi this is
so sweet
I found a perfume that I really like can
he bought me this one this is the one I
love it and then I got the Giorgio
Armani luminous silk foundation everyone
talks with this and I wanted a more like
I just wanna make a foundation for the
wedding I got it in a pretty dark shade
because I don't have any foundations for
when I'm pretty tans so it's pretty dark
but I'm gonna self tan and stuff and
then I got the Kat Von D locket
concealer because I've heard great
things about it
and I wanted a full coverage concealer
this is what just the foundation looks
like on just one coat so I think it's
gonna be super buildable and lightweight
like doesn't feel like anything's on my
face which I really like
and I'm not super tanned right now so I
think I'll be good when I'm really
really tanned and then that's the
concealer just like a very light coat
because I'm not like going out so I'm
not gonna go heavy on the concealer but
I like that baby's full coverage but you
you can like build it up and you can
just use like one coat of everything and
it's like fine for daytime so I think
it's the first tile because they are
expensive products yeah it looks really
nice not complaining but it is very
difficult to run two businesses out of a
500 square foot apartment like I just
tried to pull my license I caused it
they all fell almost all broke I have
boxes everywhere of t-shirts everywhere
like owning a clothing business you have
a lot of inventory for not doing drop
shipping and again it's 500 square feet
and I'm confined to this small little
space I'm having a meltdown right now
because I have everywhere and I
love being clean and my house is dirty
because it's also a factory all right
end of the day about to go for dinner I
have also gone to the gym and look how
nice this makeup so looks like
foundation is still fully in place
concealer has crease a little bit but I
didn't set it so I'm pretty impressed
I'm pretty reserved oh yeah she finally
died
mom's a pretty upset goodbye orchid we
booked our flights to Paris I'm so
excited
say we go from Toronto to Iceland to
Iceland to Paris it was a very cheap way
we got a really good deal so very happy
about that right now this is not
terrifying right now I'm doing the
origins sheep mask it looks like that
and it's the Refresh no no sorry it's
the nourishing sheep mask and it's the
flower fusion violet so if you saw my
story today I had a beautiful bouquet of
flowers I'm gonna Instagram as well it's
so pretty
so origins dropped off that beautiful
bouquet got to pick which one I wanted
and then they gave me all their sheet
masks so I'll tell you how it is because
I mean it smells phenomenal I'm very
happy right now
I just got an email from a company I'm
just gonna shower
gonna be you from a company's name like
someone's impersonating me so today it's
coming up at the end of August I am
going to actually look at fabrics for
some new stuff that's coming uncle we
have two things that are right now going
into production which are so cool
different like something we've never
done on uncle so that's really neat
