today I'm doing a conscious haul
so when shopping and this kind of food
while I've been doing a lot of research
into shopping just more consciously so
more ethical and more sustainable
everything here is ethical not
everything is sustainable but the work
in progress I really want you guys to be
your favorite ethical sustainable
clothing companies down below so I can
take a look at them and then the next
haul I can add more brands in so ethical
is off just the treatment of humans and
unsustainable is just the treatment of
Earth so that clothes that aren't
putting more junk into the earth and
just you know are conscious about what
they're doing to the environment while
they're making clothing if you want to
kind of get more information and
actually have a real sort of
understanding there's a great
documentary called the true cost and
there's also two apps that I wanted to
talk about project just and good on you
which are two ones an apple on two
website and if you're unsure the brand
you can search the brand and it'll kind
of give you some information on them
with any research you need to find more
than one source so we definitely don't
just take what you see at face value
definite do your own research but this
is kind of what I've done and where I'm
starting out the first store that I want
to talk about is a store called exhibit
this is a store from Singapore
everything's made in Singapore it's a
smaller boutique I really like their
stuff I found it on one of those I was
just searching ethical and sustainable
clothing and I came across this store I
bought these green cargo and they're not
like like military cargo sort of pants
they're wide-leg I really liked about
half instagrams and stuff in them I've
had them for a long time
couple months now the only thing is with
this brand is that I'm five six and
everything is a little too short I
wanted to be able to wear these with
like heels and for them to be like a
wide leg pant but I can't and that's all
because I'm guessing their normal
demographic is people from Singapore and
their average height is just shorter
than me so that's the only downside of
these other than that they're great
quality they fit beautifully and they're
just a really nice material I'm a huge
fan of these pants and they definitely
thing you should check them out they
have really nice it kind of reminds me
of mr. self-portrait a little bit you
can experiment want to talk about is
redone denim this is a pricier brand but
this is both ethical and sustainable so
redone I've done a up cycles of vintage
these right here are the redone Cindy
Crawford the Crawford jeans they're kind
of a mid-rise they have the button fly
and then they're a straight leg I got
them in the light blue color
the thing with redone though is that
everything is different like all sizes
are different so you have to be wearing
of that when ordering I got a 24 in the
Crawford and I do find them a bit snug
but I think that they do stretch out but
they are a true Jean material that kind
of stiffer denim but I really like them
and they're pretty flattering on the bum
from them I also got this redone Hanes
team was like a collab I think or maybe
they just do Hanes tees redone it's just
a crops or t-shirt it's pretty nice nice
material just a cropped t-shirt and I
did get another pair of jeans of them
they haven't arrived yet so I will link
them or I'll do some footage on them if
they do arrive but they're just black
like grungy a little bit bad year they
have a ton of different styles I'm
actually kind of lusting after the
flared cropped denim so hopefully it's
something that I like comes back in
stock and I can purchase those because I
really like the upside up cycled denim I
just like the Jean I like the way they
fit and it's ethical and simple the next
store on talk about is ever Lane I feel
like this is a huge one doing great
things for the ethical and sustainable
community fashion community we are
really kind of using them as all the
ethical I have company on so we're
really using them as a
we want to do and kind of taking tips
and points from them first thing I want
talk about is this sweater that I'm
wearing right now this is a cashmere
sweater and it was only $100 but you
people you know you shot for cashmere
it's pretty expensive it's a pretty good
deal I got it this camel color it's nice
and soft it's really nice good quality I
bought this in the up in the store in
New York they just opened up two stores
so I love this very nice and then I also
got this tea this too is only $16 as a
bonus table tea hopefully you know one
day uncle will be able to bring their
prices down to $16 tea but it's nice
soft really pretty pink color has a
pocket a good team
yeah everyone any come and check them
out check them out they started with me
they're very transparent with where
their stuff is made so that's really
nice because I just spoke of it uncle
I'm gonna talk about on the whole you're
also ethical and mostly sustainable we
are working towards being more
sustainable than we already are
I'm just going to show you a few things
from us this is our feminist tea so it
has that stretch to it now this is a
newer version because we're playing
around some fabrics this is the newer
version has some stretch to it it's
really soft this is in a bag because it
is a sample but this is our waffle dress
this is in the natural color you love
this because you can kind of dress stuff
you can also dress it down I like to
wear that with commerce and just like
socks in a jacket but I do I really love
this I wear this all over nice and it's
kind of that material that you can wear
in the spring but also in the winter
because it has that that kind of nice
versatile look to it also wanted to show
you a hoodie this is it a package -
mocking on - ship but this is the white
uncle hoodie it's the beach' box ooh
pretty houses beautiful like Japanese
inspired print on the back really nice
quality made in Canada but yeah I'm
checked it uncle check it on the box my
clothing brand we do basics for everyone
okay next I want to talk about
Reformation Reformation is obviously a
huge store now they're all the West
ethical stable very transparently worth
a lot of great information on their
website so I got a few things from them
the first being these jeans I actually
went to the Reformation store in New
York on Bond Street which was such a
cool experience they have this like
really futuristic retail experience
going on these are the black I don't
their cult but they're just like a black
kind of cropped Jean they have this
detailing right here
that's like fringe they're super
flattering I got a size 24 and if it's
pretty true to size which I appreciate
again I'm not really thick sort of true
denim not a lot of stretch to them but
they're really flattering and super
comfortable and I really like to look at
them before I bought those I had gotten
these and these are a pair of course and
they bought these in 225 and they are a
bit fake so I do know that I am a true
24 in reprobation I definitely could
have bought a 24 in these but these are
cords button-fly wide-leg and love these
they're very nice last thing I thought
from Reformation is a jumpsuit I'm not
gonna hold it up for you just because
it's just like to be showing it to you
it's just there's no point gold velvet
jumpsuit I'm wearing this on New Year's
but super excited to wear it because
it's just so beautiful perforation reeks
makes like not really like trendy or
pieces whereas a berlin makes it super
basic pieces Reformation has that corner
style kind of trendy or aspect to it
their stuff is really nice good quality
it is on the pricier side but when
you're paying for quality ethics and
sustainable fabrics you are gonna pay
more but the great thing about you know
paying more for this is that it is stuff
that's gonna last in your wardrobe for
four years not just it's not fast
fashion you're not gonna throw it away
you're gonna actually have it in your
wardrobe for a long time so think about
that when you are looking at the prices
that you know these people are trying to
pay people fair wages they're trying to
I thought if that's good for the
environment they own their own factory
there's a lot that goes into it and they
need to make a profit on top of that so
it is pricier but honestly it's worth it
next thing I want to talk about a
shopping vintage so going to your local
Value Village your local goodwill your
local thrift shop and picking up some
items off this is a sweater that I wear
all the time
a lot of you were asking about it this
was picked up at a thrift store it is a
I think Neil Diamond this winter all
right my friend just kind of de-stress
it a little bit but you can find great
pieces out there are stores you can find
vintage Levi's jeans you can find
sweaters coat they have everything it's
just people clothes that people don't
want anymore and they donate but you can
find anything from there and they kind
of upcycle it to even make you your own
observable on YouTube Sara Donna she's
pretty small youtuber but she does a lot
of things around thrifting and upcycling
so check her out if you're Matt but
thrifting is definitely a great way to
be sustainable the next thing is a
luxury item and it isn't sustainable but
it is ethical
it's an ACME Studios scarf it's pink in
red I'm obsessed with this scarf it's
like a wooly material I just I love the
color combination it's a really good
quality scarf I did look online Aki does
have a lot of things in place to oversee
their factories to make sure people are
getting fair wages and being treated
well while making their clothing
obsessive the scarf it's so nice just
big and red and pinkies wrap it around
so warm
yeah if you're into luxury do you should
know that
Aki does have things in place to be
better for people really cool the last
thing I have absolutely no idea of death
: sustainable and I want to show it to
you because I wanted to get your opinion
and if you knew anything about it so
this is a triangle bathing suit triangle
did suddenly this it's their new bathing
suit I don't know what it's called it
will be linked but I know that triangle
is made in China which doesn't
necessarily mean anything bad you know a
lot of my and stuff is made in China as
well but I have they didn't not
transparent at all about where their
stuff is made so if you have any
information on that
I'd love to know I just want to show you
because I showed these bathing suits
before and they have changed the booty
area made it a lot longer because I feel
like my boobs are kind of pouring out of
them before so this is a lot bigger and
easier to keep your your boobs
places their white invading suit and you
have any information on a triangle where
it's made and how it's made I'd love to
hear some comment back down below and
then some things I don't have but I've
done some research and I think are
pretty cool companies one is called
nausea and it's an underwear ethical
sustainable underwear company and what I
really liked what they won't really
caught my eyes they have nudes for every
skin tone where I feel like you know if
you go to Victoria's Secret they have
one nude and it's for kind of tanned
white people but Naja really has a
variety of different nudes for a variety
of different skin tones which I just
found really amazing and their ethical
seem you know they have some more lacy
stuff they have a bunch of do myself but
I think you should check them out
they're really cool and then there was
another company that's called AARC will
be linked down below pressure it's
called a RC and they kind of take away
all the research and kind of have like a
boutique that just has ethical and
sustainable items I'm shot consciously
so you can go through and shop there
knowing that you're shopping well so
I'll link that one down below as well
