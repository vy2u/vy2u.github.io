today I'm here with valaria lip of etske
why are you that good I did it yes got
it
okay so today we're gonna be doing our
winter wardrobe essentials video yeah
that's it
and we're also we ask each other
questions learning a bit more about
malaria and a bit more about me and our
Styles where we get our style
inspiration from mm-hmm let's do it
so I like our first category is clothes
cuz I really like those moto coats you
know like the acne moto coat yes I love
those they're like a leather jacket for
the winter I'm so into it but is it warm
enough oh my god yeah I'm gonna show you
yes okay this one is by mr. Saturday and
so warm it's like the two-tone velvet
cool yeah sort of thing and then this
one's old from Zara and this one's super
warm and then wear this all last winter
and how's that like kind of Sheen to it
so it looks like leather almost so I
have like already a sense of like who's
your you know what's your style but if
you could choose your style animal a
straight face by saying and I am
assuring you that I will try to
trademark that thing because style
animal is the next spirit animal yes
okay what was your skyline in my style I
really like the Olsen twins when I can
find photos of them because I feel like
they're never photographed and I love I
feel like because you can't find any of
their photos you already like start
making in your like making up in your
head kind of their what they wear yeah
they're just so cool
they are super cool what was your
favorite era of them like when they're
kids
but style era I think maybe mid 2000
they just were there laughing when I
went Starbuck cops everywhere yeah yeah
I like them like a dark and drapey and
they like door makeup and their hair is
always natural okay tell me about your
coats now okay so I have this trick
we're basically in the winter I hate
dressing up in the winter because I feel
like I can't like in a sauna and spring
you can play with colors and I'm
two colors now but in the winter it's
like everything is like you can't see
anything yeah so what I do is I'll
basically have the same uniform every
single day
basically what we're reading right now
we're twins today yes the Olsen twins
hey all I do is I invest in my coats so
I'm very serious when it comes to style
I brought all my coats to show so I'll
buy like they can be high and low this
was like this one I got from like Russia
I just buy different prints so I can
wear the same like clothes underneath
but I put a different jacket every day
and it's like a totally different menu
and then when I feel a little more like
like sassy yes I get this one and this
one was an investment he's actually
bought it on sale but it was still
expensive it's by Sandro and this like
brings a pop of color into the wardrobe
and makes it about these colors are so
nice yeah I always buy colors that I
know will match with kind of the
majority of my wardrobe and this is a
nice like muted color so yeah when I
feel I don't know what I feel I feel
happy and like that emoji yeah yeah so I
get this one this is just sorry I find
that with Zara always go and I'll find
like good kind of statement pieces and
they're not very warm but I am like
dressing up basic I also love layering
coats like an overcoat with like a like
a leather jacket underneath there like a
blazer in there and you get that texture
that's the thing you can look like any
jack is it you like I'm there or like a
big sweater - yes and then this one
which is my like darling of coats
because it's so big and fluffy and
comedy I'm gonna say like I love that
like if you ever wonder what I'm wearing
on the role of this it's always this but
I like to switch with my coats every
single day yeah so that's my coat pack
okay now who's your who's our style
aníbal my stylist she's on Instagram
she's Baggio Giovanna but that but the
glia and Gilbert
anyways her thing is a her short cut is
bad Gio and what she is
she is anymore right now she's like a no
oh yeah oh this woman literally like oh
she loves color yes she opened my eye
yeah I love it
she opened my eyes to like being fun and
risky and like just like enjoying
fashion yeah so she's my current style I
don't know but I mean for my always and
forever my style
I'll icon will be Kate Moss she's good
so good and she's like I'm so cool just
so cool yeah okay beep sweater wife will
be your favorite go to like top choice
turtlenecks the season 4 meets all
turtle eggs I like to like thinner ones
so you can layer them under things and
then I also like I have a chunky one
here it is like who does a lot of good
chunk eternal and yes but what I'm
really really been liking is sleeveless
turtlenecks and then I can layer them
under sweaters I can layer them under
button-downs like anything and it clicks
great pop yeah it keeps you warm and
it's like so chic it is very yeah you
know what I love this I've noticed that
a lot of people doing it's like moving
from fall to winter turtleneck and then
like a big button down and then like a
coat so good and like that layer I love
like death to an elephant yeah there's
so much going on I always usually go for
like big chunkiness but yeah like I
didn't bring any examples cuz I'm
wearing so nice though where's yeah from
Topshop mmm I like it and this one is
crop I gotta flick to buy crop because I
feel like with sweaters I can put like a
button down under and then the rest of
the bun down is like peeping yeah the
word is used peeping we can use that
word yeah so what will be your favorite
trend for this season I know I just
talked about coats and I love a moto
coat but that puffer coat trend for me
coming in is just like it's everything
that a Canadian needs and wants you know
it's junkies wear a big coat puffy and
like it keeps you so warm but they have
so many good options now so I would say
my favorite trend for its winter is
mixing up eminence
with like masculine pieces so the boots
that I'm wearing that we're gonna talk
about and just like big jackets you know
yeah like a dress or like even that moto
jacket like it just toughen up anything
exactly I love that like you know
playing like New York's position between
the feminine it said I'm a princess but
I'll kick your ass you know I mean yeah
it's kind of soft like that so that's my
favorite trend for this season
okay so pants I love black jeans like I
just love them they're just so first
Thailand like fits so well and make you
look so tall I mean I'm pretty short so
if you buy the right there yeah they
have to be like a bit high-waisted to
kind of like cinch your waist
I have a few options All Saints stilt
jeans are amazing they fit so well they
don't stretch out and they're kind of
like that faded there that's the perfect
height I just love them and I like that
faded look cuz it just kind of mean sure
I'm gonna look a little bit more grungy
yeah Topshop Jamie Jean is just like a
classic in there yeah everything
everyone loves a talk show it makes your
butt look so good it's true especially
for those who don't have one and then
these are something I bought in the
summer and they're like oh my god I have
these do I that's the ones I brought the
split seam no you have to wear a heel
with them but it's worth it yeah that's
what I love so for me like the jeans
that I brought are basically the same so
I got these these are also grow in the
same type of material yeah I mean I
think it's basically was all like
recycled denim yeah so I love mom jeans
it's such a cliche furs on my mom but I
love how comfortable they are
I love that they're a little tighter on
the waist and they're like a little
looser down
I feel like say thank you look what you
have hips to like I don't have any help
yes that's great
so like makes you kind of look feminine
yeah and it's again like you know I love
that I'm Don hams
they're just they look very effortless
and I think that's always kind of the
look I'm going for
yeah I'm like a chic bum anyway
yeah yeah I always tell people like
invest and good denim totally you
literally need one or two pairs of
amazing denim and you have to wash them
that often yeah
they last like years yeah what is your
favorite store for essentials I would
say that I think are rich they are doing
pretty good and I always look for you
know staple pieces good quality
turtlenecks so like good denim yeah we
just they have a lot of brands in there
and I like shopping online their online
stores really is nice yeah and I'm a
one-stop shop yeah what's William well
I'm gonna plug myself I am a clothing
company called uncle so I get all my
basics from there we like strive to make
the perfect t-shirt so I think we've
really killed that there's all my
t-shirts and I'm just from there okay
now shoes I always go for a Chelsea boot
these are pretty inexpensive from Aldo
so you're not you don't feel too bad
with Aldo yeah oh wow I mean everyone
has a Chelsea boot but I really like the
ones from although they're super
comfortable and since they're not
expensive you can kind of justify I
think it like beat up that year by
another career the next year I actually
prefer like shoes that get beaten up a
little yeah I don't think so make sure
you know yeah so that's why for me and
with boots I'll go to vintage stores
probably when I go to New York they
always have like way better yeah and
this is an example what I'm wearing here
this was $25 out of interest or yes
those are so nice the quality is amazing
I loved like I said a clunky kind of
masculine boots and just because you
know my style is very kind of gentle
yeah yeah so I like to have a little and
they're also like a company that still
makes clothes so it's like it's not what
every vintage like three fry fry yeah
those are really good quality boots yeah
I believe someone gave those up I know
but I got no how would you describe your
style in three words and go casual yeah
oh God what do you new words for me
that's so nice Thanks that is so nice
I'll take it those were three words
that's a good one excuse me we're
seasoning okay what are your three words
to describe your style I would say
comfortable effortless and you have to
say chic your stylist Toshi Thanks I
wanted to say too cool for school but I
feel like it's not a cool term and you
know I would say chic chic oh don't you
with the go it with the grocery bags
yeah like that's that's so good so yeah
what are you go to accessories okay
first I love small sunglasses I think
they're so in and they just look like so
hip and cool I mean I don't think they
actually protect your eyes or do
anything constructive but they look cool
so that's good I feel like you have to
have a certain personality to be able to
rock these yeah you rock this then look
yeah thank you thank you
these went for robbery and fraud and
they have a bunch of like small
sunglasses and I just I'm obsessed I
think backpack purses are just so key in
the winter because then you don't have
to carry anything it's just think I
could stay warm
no this is my Chloe backpack I bought
this secondhand what yeah I bought on
bestir collective oh my god any love the
perfect condition so backpacks very key
and then gloves like I these are leather
ones but honestly I usually wear those
like dollar ones you can get at the
convenience store and just like have
them stashed everywhere like so my car
my pockets and they're just like it's
just me my fan said yeah yeah here I
know you're driving like your hands need
to be for me my accessories I always I
have like a ridiculous amount of super
huge scars that I just like wrap around
myself like 30 times and you just like
see is I love those because then when I
go into a place like I'll take off my
jacket but then I'll use it as like a
yeah and then you're not like boiling
hot because you have that look away
yeah exactly so I even like I feel like
I'd never dress up completely like
winter yes inappropriate so those always
save me
so these honestly you can find anywhere
this is I think life is a gem and as
long as it's huge
I'm good to go with that this one I got
us a present from Max Mara but it's oh
that is lace this is hilarious shank
winter she was all you need to know I
think Oh Oh be nice
you're almost my Hackford be nice is
steal your boyfriend husbands whatever
boy you have in your life be nice this
one is like literally I think the first
beanie I bought I realize that there is
no this is Gary this is the first one
cause it's pink yeah you know how I feel
about think so this is kind of a pop of
color so what I like to do is I have
like gray and black like you know the
basic ones but then with things like
that I'll mix it up if I have a coat
let's say that's black and white I'll
just put like a colorful beanie and just
like bring a little color to it oh yes
you gotta like bring some life in the
winter it's so hard right with the red
coat or something I'll have I'll steal
like Gary's like great beanie anyway so
I play around with my babies but that's
