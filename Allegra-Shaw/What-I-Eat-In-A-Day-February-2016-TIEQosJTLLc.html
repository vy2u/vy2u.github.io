what I eat on an average day when I am
working from home so for breakfast I
usually have breakfast around 9:00 a.m.
sometimes a little bit earlier and it
always depends in the day but today I am
just cutting up some mango as you can
see here I love mango and basically the
only like fresh fruit I will buy is
mango so I'm just cutting that up into
little hedgehogs
I called hedgehogs I don't know if
that's what they're actually called and
then I do this while my coffee is
steeping because I use a French press
for coffee so it needs to like steep a
little bit so I just cut up my mango
while I do that and then I do the press
on the French press and I'm drinking
kicking horse coffee and this is the
light blend I think but I have the dark
medium and light blend I just switch it
up every day like all coffee
except Tim Hortons coffee I don't like
to put smells gross
and then I'm just sprinkling some chia
seeds on my mango they don't really
taste like anything but they're so good
for you so I thought what the heck
and then I'm usually hungry by like 11
so I'll eat something sometimes if I'm
out I'll grab like a hash brown or
something from Hortons but today I am
making a beet smoothie and it is amazing
I can write the recipe down if you want
then around 12:30 I eat lunch and I'm
just putting some avocado some lime
juice and salt and pepper into a full
and mashing that all together I'm also
adding some hemp hearts because they're
so so good for you and I'm doing this
while I toast my toast I don't eat a lot
of bread so this is kind of like my
treat for me um and yeah it's really
really delicious and also take out the
avocado pit and save it dry it out and
then shred it and put it in smoothies
the avocado pit is so so good for you so
I'm just gonna spread this all over my
toast which toasted really weird because
of the very large
I also basically cut dairy out of my
diet but the one thing I do allow is
Parmesan cheese because does not hurt my
stomach so I just created some of that
over it and then throughout the day I
only drink lemon water so I just cut up
a lemon and I poured some water in it
and that's my lunch so I have dinner
between six and nine really just depends
of the day and I don't usually sack in
the afternoon I usually just want to
forget to eat so I'm just cutting up a
sweet potato half a sweet potato and I
am just pulling off some kale and
getting some arugula and setting it all
out to - hair and I am taking some
Brussels sprouts I love Brussels sprouts
oh my god and I am just cutting the ends
off and then cutting them in half
and then putting the Brussels sprouts on
to a baking pan while the hut oven is
preheating to 190 degrees Celsius I'm
sorry my evidence Celsius and I don't
know what that is in Fahrenheit and then
I am covering those olive oil and some
salt and those Pulido's in the oven and
then the way the water is boiling for
the sweet potatoes so I'm just putting
those into boiling water and then I'm
going to cover that and let those simmer
and soften and then I'm heating up some
oil in a pan and putting all the arugula
and the kale in the pan and I'm going to
saute that
I wanted to be moist I'm shouting a
little bit of chicken stock you can also
add vegetable broth to your vegetarian
so yeah just continue on Tina and adding
some garlic in there as well and then
once that's done I put some butter in
the pan and I put an array of mushrooms
is just like a mix of different
mushrooms into the pan and I'm going to
saute those as well so once that's done
I just put on the plate and then I drain
the sweet potatoes and I just start
mashing them up I added a little bit of
butter into them you can add butter or
olive oil if done both taste the same
and then some salt and also some garlic
and then I'm putting that on the plate
taking the brussel sprouts out of the
oven plating those and then I am done
this delicious dinner was amazing and
really not that hard it can take that
long and then here is me eating alone
watching midnight Paris because I like
to watch TV or a movie when I eat
because I live alone and yes that's it I
