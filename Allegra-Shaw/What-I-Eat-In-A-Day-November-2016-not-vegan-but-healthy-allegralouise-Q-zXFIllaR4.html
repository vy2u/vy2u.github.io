I eat today for this video I've teamed
up with celestial Seasonings tea they've
sponsored this video which is epic
because I've been drinking celestial
Seasonings herbal teas since I was a kid
now I've really changed what I do in the
mornings I used to be coffee addicted
but lately I've been drinking herbal
teas that I can still get that nice warm
drink in the morning but try to stop my
addiction to caffeine what I've been
drinking in the morning is the lemon
zinger by celestial Seasonings
tea it's a really nice high-quality
lemon tea and it's so perfect in the
morning it's gives me that kickstart a
need to begin my day I've been trying to
make smoothies in the morning just cuz I
feel like I need to eat more fruit and
this is just a great way to add a bunch
of things into a drink and get it all in
your body so I just improved some acai
ginger in a smoothie is so good I didn't
know but oh my god is delicious putting
some flax in some superfoods some chia
seeds add some honey for some sweetness
and honey's good for you as well umm and
then it looks disgusting and then I'm
adding this a coconut dream milk which
is just like a non-dairy coconut milk
which is epic and then I blended it up
and made half a cup of smoothie by
accident should have made more so I
drink tea and I drink my smoothie in the
mornings usually running around all day
so in the middle of the day I'm usually
out in the bed in my car this is like a
classic me eating in my car um my go-to
was a tomato avocado sandwich but the
place that I got them from stop selling
them so this is just a double toasted
bagel with butter cheddar and tomato and
then I always just drink water
throughout the day when I go home that
day I was hungry again I'd gone to gym
so I wanted to get some more food I just
made some avocado toast I mean I think
you guys have seen me make avocados like
ten times kind of embarrassing but it's
just such an easy snack so just toasting
bread I get some avocado put some hemp
parts in it squeeze I usually squeeze
lime to have
lemon salt pepper and then I put it on
the toast and I just grate some Parmesan
cheese on it and it's delicious
and again just keeping with the water
trend I drink water throughout the day I
didn't film myself making dinner just
because it's pretty simple it's
basically just pan-seared salmon with
lemon salt pepper and I boiled some
asparagus and that was all I had for
dinner and obviously my massive jug of
water
I do have sleep problems and something
that my dad has been doing for me since
I was a kid and I do it for myself now
is drink the celestial Seasonings
sleepytime tea it's just a really
calming and relaxing tea gets me in the
mood to sleep comment down below if you
drink this tea as a kid to fall asleep
as well thank you guys so much for
watching this video
love you all peace and love</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
