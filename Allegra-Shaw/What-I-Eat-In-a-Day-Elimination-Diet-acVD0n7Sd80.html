day elimination diet style this is what
I do in the morning I just boiled some
water and I cut up a lemon and I drink
that before I eat any food it's really
good for you helps with your metabolism
helps you digest things and I've just
been eleven this breakfast and snacks
are definitely the hardest thing to eat
on this elimination diet because all you
want to eat is carbs and bread and
cheese but you can't so breakfast I
usually this tonight before and it's
just some wheat-free gluten-free rolled
oats and then some chia seeds and then I
take some hemp arts which I had never
heard of before but they don't taste
very good and then I just take coconut
milk or almond milk I usually use
coconut milk I just think it tastes a
little sweeter and makes it nicer to eat
and that is just put that in and then I
just mix it up and I add some frozen
fruit the more you add the better it
tastes so go crazy with that fruit oh
and I had some sinan whoops
you
so for lunch I usually have something
made in the fridge this is what I was
eating a lot last week which is just a
turkey soup
so there's homemade turkey broth there's
kale sweet potato carrot asparagus and
brown rice and Turkey obviously and I
just throw that in a bowl and heat it up
and then to go along my tricky seat
I usually have gluten-free wheat free
bread which is awesome you usually have
a pretty good dinner but this was a very
sad dinner this is just chicken and
brown rice and then I tried to make
sweet potato fries and failed and they
look disgusting because I burnt the
out of them
and then for dessert I just have some
grapes and I have this avocado cocoa
powder thing which is really good and I
will teach you guys how to make it if
you'd like let me know in the comments
below that is the basic day in my life I
also have a kale chip video which I eat
for snacks check my website if you want
all of these recipes and I'll talk to
you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
