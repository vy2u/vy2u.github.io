in a day I haven't done one of these in
a while so I'm pretty excited to show
you some new things and some things that
have stayed the same simulator last year
I've partnered up again with my favorite
tea brands celestial Seasonings tea so
thank you to them for sponsoring this
video so for the morning I always start
my day with a beautiful cup of coffee I
used to buy coffee I don't do that
anymore because I like to save money and
then I always drink a really big and
nutritious protein smoothie and I put
tons of really great ingredients in the
smoothie so that it keeps me full and I
also get all my like daily doses of
fruits and vegetables and vitamins and
minerals and all that good stuff so that
is my breakfast and that keeps me full
for quite a long time
so since I don't really drink juice iced
tea is a great option making yourself so
here I'm taking the celestial Seasonings
country peach passion tea and putting
hot water into the jug I would usually
let it steep longer than I did here but
I just throw the ice in and then I put
it in the fridge and kind of let it cool
down in there and then I would add more
ice in after but I really like celestial
seasoning because of the quality of the
ingredients it's just a really good
quality tea and it's like the hipster
tea before hipster was a thing and they
just made me feel really good after I
drink it I've been drinking celestial
Seasonings since I was a kid if you saw
my video last year I said that as well
it's just one of my favorite tea brands
and always has been lately I have been
loving a tuna bagel so I get these for
lunch quite often it's just tuna tomato
and lettuce on a pumpernickel sesame
bagel and I'll just throw some hot sauce
on that and have it for lunch it's
really really filling and pretty healthy
I usually grab some sort of snack in the
afternoon I like berries I like bananas
I really like almonds I like eating
olives or I'll just make like a small
quick salad so for dinner one of my
favorite dishes that I've been making
our homemade tacos because they're so
easy so I'm making shrimp and tempeh
tacos tonight these are some ingredients
that you'll need if you want to make
these ones cabbage avocado tempeh
tortillas limes jalapenos and cilantro
you can put whatever you want in tacos
and that's what's so amazing about them
so first I'm making a small block I am
just I put the avocado in I put some
cilantro and some chili flakes and
putting in you can put whatever you want
any don't put cilantro and I know a lot
of people don't like cilantro and then I
just smash it up and make a beautiful
guacamole now we're going to make the
sauce for the shrimps so first I'm
squeezing half a lime into a bowl and
then I will drizzle some olive oil as
well I just kind of eyeball all of this
there's no exact measurements after that
I throw in some chili flakes and then I
will mix in some paprika and then to top
it off off some hot sauce I like things
spicy feel free to not put in hot sauce
if you're not into the whole spicy thing
mix it all together throw the shrimps in
and then mix the shrimp together
so I'm just heating up a hot pan and
then drizzling the hot pan with olive
oil you can use whatever oil you choose
to cook with and then I am putting the
shrimps on the pan and then I'll drizzle
the leftover sauce on top so the
shrimp's really gets the flavor that I
want in the same pan I will put up some
cut-up tempeh if you wanted to just do
tempeh you could do that if you're vegan
good option for these tacos the tempeh
ones were really really delicious
so I'll just sizzle those up and then
I'll also heat up the tortillas at the
same time time to actually make the
tacos the most fun pork part first I put
the block on and then I go in and put
some cabbage on top next are the
jalapenos then it's time for the
shrimp's are you but put two or three
taco depending on how many I made
preferably three though I then garnish
the taco with some cilantro feel like
cilantro don't put it on and then I just
throw some hot sauce on top of that and
you're done so beautiful so pretty and
very delicious
I usually try to sit outside for dinner
because this warm weather is not going
to last forever this taco dish was so
good I highly recommend you try it and
then with dinner I always have a big
glass of water here I had someone in
water and then before I go to bed I
always make a sleepytime tea it's just a
ritual I've been doing since I was a kid
my dad used to do it for me and it
really just helps calm me down put me in
the mood to go to bed and honestly helps
me sleep so it just boiled some water
make a sleepy time if you even got Joey
into sleepy time tea he loves it now
remember to click the link in the
downbar to check out celestial
Seasonings I think my favorites are the
apple cinnamon and the sleepy time of
course especially because it brings back
all those memories but I want to branch
out and try some new flavors so I'd love
if you'd comment down below your
favorite flavors of celestial Seasonings
and why thank you guys so much for
watching I love you all peace and love
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
