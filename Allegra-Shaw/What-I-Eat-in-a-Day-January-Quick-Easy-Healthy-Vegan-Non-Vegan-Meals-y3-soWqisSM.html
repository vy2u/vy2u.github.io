eat in a day for January 2018 this is
Chloe if it met her she's my dad's dog
and I'm taking care of her so I'm
definitely trying to start the year on a
healthy note after holiday season I'm
eating and drinking I kind of want to
get back into the swing of things and
start a good and healthy routine for
pre-breakfast
when I first wake up I always have a
coffee as an espresso coffee and I just
drink my coffee black and then I always
have a big thing of water with me and
I'll refill this throughout the day so
for breakfast lately I've either been
having oatmeal a smoothie or both so
this boat meal is just instant oats I
just add water to it hot water and
doesn't put flax in it something like a
protein collagen powder I just put
different toppings and then that
smoothie you can find the recipe on my
blog but keeps me full I really really
like that breakfast for lunch I have
been loving this broccoli crunch salad
from Whole Foods I always have a pretty
big thing of it in my fridge to eat
really filling it really delicious and
then with that I have a premade vegan
tomato soup and this is just a really
nice cozy lunch for the winter time and
then with that I will drink my water so
for a snack between lunch and dinner if
I if I'm feeling just kind of hungry
I'll have something like a made good
ball which is like a granola bar and has
all these and good ingredients in them
they're really good for you and they're
really easy and good to take on the go
and if I'm hungry I'll have something
like a veggie burger and just have the
burger with some hot sauce and they
taste delicious and I'm really into them
for dinner we've been enjoying something
that's really light and nutritious and
filling but easy to make so this is a
pinko and almond flour crusted white
fish this asparagus is just made in a
frying pan with some water and olive oil
and then that's some vegan sriracha mayo
and it's just a really delicious and
easy meal that we've been enjoying
after dinner we are actually spoiled
today and we got Kelley's bait shop
delivered some vegan treats for us this
is a nice vegan cookie
I usually have a sleepytime tea or
something about sort before I go to bed
thank you guys so much for watching and
let me know what you guys have been
enjoying eating in January I know it's
only day four but let me know peace love
love you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
