day June editions is an average day and
this is vegan because lately I have been
eating mostly vegan breakfast this
morning is an SAE Bowl you'll need heme
parts you need flax cinnamon chia seeds
agave syrup at banana coconut shreds
oats for granola acai thing
frozen fruit and then any toppings like
berries and stuff so you're just cup of
frozen fruit the pack up acai is all
going to a nutribullet tablespoon of
chia seeds tablespoon of flax will like
a little bit less than a tablespoon 1/2
tablespoon of hemp hearts some cinnamon
and some agave syrup and some water I
just put a little bit of water and to
make it easier to blend I put it all
together and then I just blend it up and
make this little bowl and then I just
throw any topping so I'm putting some
blackberries raspberries I put some oats
some coconut shreds some chia seeds and
some bananas and it was honestly so
delicious and filling and then I have
lemon water in the morning and this is a
iced coffee with soy milk half sweet
from Starbucks because I've 11 those
this summer they are delicious so I have
breakfast around 10 a.m.
after I've woken up and meditated and
done all my stuff and this doesn't fall
for a pretty long time I know I have
this in one of my other day what i eated
days but this is just something I love
so much and I've kind of switched up a
little bit so abaca dough tomato salt
and pepper some breads 12 green bread
and you also need a line so just putting
the avocado in the bowl
like so adding some salt and some pepper
and then also going to squeeze just a
tiny bit of lime on top of that and then
I'm gonna mush it all up together with
the pork while I'm doing this I'm also
toasting the toast so when that's done I
just put on the plate I only had bums of
the bread which is the worst but I just
spread the avocado all over you could
even put some hemp parts on top if you
wanted
I've actually been putting some hot
chili flakes lately and it's been really
really good and then I just slice some
tomato on top add some more salt and
pepper and it's good to go I is like my
favorite meal ever I'm so obsessed I
love it ate all the time and then
obviously drinking lemon water I'm
usually running around the afternoon so
I'll grab something when I'm out but I
love kombucha I love tomato on toast and
I love just like snacking on fruit or
dried fruits my favorite for dinner made
Buffalo cauliflower bites I got the
recipe from Hawker food they were
amazing seeing some cauliflower you need
1 3/4 cup of flour 1/2 a cup of
non-dairy milk and 1/2 a cup of water
I used almond flour by the way and then
to Table two teaspoons of garlic powder
two teaspoons of onion powder I didn't
have garlic powder 1 teaspoon of cumin
and one teaspoon of paprika that is a
little more than a teaspoon and then
just some salt and pepper and then
you're just going to mix it up and I put
some garlic in because I didn't have
garlic powder but you just mix it up
first we will be linked down below
obviously
the oven also should be preheating at
around 400 degrees Fahrenheit to ten
degrees Celsius so you take your
cauliflower dip it into the batter tap
it off and put it on a baking sheet with
parchment paper on top so that it
doesn't stick so then I threw them into
the oven and they're going to bake for
25 minutes and now I'm just making the
hot sauce so all I took was some vegan
butter and I took some Frank's Red Hot
and I just put it on the stove and just
heated it up until the butter is melted
and then I also made a salt vinegar 1
which is just butter apple cider vinegar
and then some salt basically so this is
what they look like when they come out
all you do is take them out and then dip
them in the sauce and put them back on
the pan because they're gonna go back in
for another 25 minutes I did most of the
cauliflower in the hot sauce but I also
did some in the salt and vinegar and
both were delicious
I highly recommend you walk too hot for
food video because they're way more
in-depth a recipe and they know what
they're talking about these are going
back in for 25 minutes and then when
they come out I while they are baking I
just cut up some carrots and made the
vegan ranch sauce that they have on
their website as well really good and
then I just added a little more sauce on
top of the cauliflowers to make them
list me and saucy and they were so
delicious highly recommend for dessert I
usually have fruit or whatever I'm
feeling this day I ate dinner in bed and
watch orange new black and it was a
divine evening hey I hope you guys
