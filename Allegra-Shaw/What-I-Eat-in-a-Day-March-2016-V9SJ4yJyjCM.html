in a day who does this every morning
books in the fridge nothing to eat I
just want to say that I am 5 6 and 120
pounds and I'm very healthy I never get
sick my nutritionist my naturopath my
doctor I'll say I'm healthy so I got a
lot of on my last video but let's
just get into this video this is a
breakfast that I was eating a lot in
March um so first I am taking up my
coffee putting it in my coffee grinder
grinding up those beans and then putting
it into the French press while the water
boils and then I am taking a piece of
toast and putting it into the toaster
doesn't really fit that well next I'm
taking an avocado and slicing it in half
I'm not only going to be using 1/2 for
this breakfast open it up and then I am
the water's boiled so I'm just pouring
that into the French press and then I'm
going to let that sit for about 4 to 5
minutes depending on if I forget about
it
next the toast is ready so I'm just
going to take the avocado with a fork
out and smash it mush it's or whatever
onto the piece of toast
once that's done and the water in the
pot is boiling I turn off the heat and
then I crack an egg into the water just
like that actually realize that I forgot
the vinegar in the water which you're
supposed to do not really sure why so I
did that and then I'm just pushing the
egg to the side because this isn't a
very big pot and I'm going to crack
another egg because I was feeling hungry
this morning
then I'm just putting the egg while
attempting to put the egg on to the
toasts was really going very well for me
either that morning and doctor that I
just throw some salt and pepper on it
you can also put some lime on it which
is really good and then I press buy
coffee pour that into my coffee cup yeah
I just take that and enjoy it it's
delicious breakfast I drink my coffee
black and then I also have lemon water
on the side as well after the gym I will
use the slender blend in vanilla as a
protein shake I'll either just put three
scoops and water or I will make a
smoothie usually lunch is on the go and
this day I was feeling like a breakfast
sandwich from Starbucks so I got that
and I got a dairy-free chai tea latte
and it was delicious
hmm
for dinner this night I actually felt
like chicken which I don't really eat
very often so I just took a chicken
thigh and put it into this glass thing
cut up some sweet potatoes kind of
running low on some ingredients I just
kind of made up some stuff cut up the
sweet potato and cut up some Brussels
sprouts and put them on top again hadn't
really gone grocery shopping so didn't
really have a lot then I just squeezing
some lemon on top putting some garlic on
top and putting some rosemary leaves on
top and then adding some chicken stock
to the bottom and then I am putting it
into the oven at 250 degrees Celsius for
about an hour and then that was pretty
delicious and then always I drink lemon
water with dinner for dessert I had a
mango but I didn't film it if you guys
love these videos let me know and I will
make one monthly for you I hope you guys
enjoyed this video and I'll talk to you
soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
