open in the wanders off hey guys so
today I'm gonna do a what's in my purse
video summer edition so it's very small
purse um the way I like to sort of
travel with my belongings is I either
will carry my full-size wallet and
that's it or I'll bring this small
little bags so I've been loving this
small little bag this is from All Saints
and it's act like tiny tiny tiny and it
has this silver chain and has silver
zipper here and it opens like this you
just it's a fold over bag it's kind of
stuffed right now but it folds over it's
really small and just easy to carry
around so let's just get right into it
so the first thing is there's a back
pocket right here and I just throw my
phone in here so if my phone either be
in this back pocket just like sticking
out or in my actual back pocket my phone
is broken right now which sucks but then
on the back of my phone I keep this
little card wallet and I just always
have my debit card
and my ID in here it's always been just
like girl my phone and go and do
whatever I need to do and this is what I
also like to just take out at night then
when we go inside just unzip I have my
keys I just have my host key my mail key
in my fob and she didn't know who Sergey
black felt so I have this little black
belt keychain I just have small just
keys I hate my keychain so love that and
then ladies I have these OB tampons
these are so great because this purse is
so tiny and these just fit right into
the purse they're so little
they don't have an applicator which
makes them very small and I don't like
to even take a person when I go out at
night so if I need tampon I can just
slip this in my back pocket and
literally no know that you even have a
tampon on you which is amazing and
there's no applicator so they're super
eco-friendly which is always a bonus um
yeah I love these I've always always
been a tampon person and I find these
very comfortable and use these for years
actually and yeah they're just uh very
comfy so love those if you want to get
your own box of these you can click the
link in the description or you can click
the link on the screen and you can fill
in your information and you can get a
free box of those while supplies last
which is great so just keep two of those
in the purse you know just in case the
next thing is my car key is my little
Jenna car key I keep these separate
because I walk around a lot they don't
wanna have my party on me all the time
so just queuing keys separate the next
thing is this hand cream it's coconut
hand cream from the body shop I love the
body shop I think they're not I use are
really great you know to some animals
they're fair trade you know so I love
that and I just love to have hand cream
on me at all times and the next thing is
this film charger my phone charger is a
necessity because my phone always dies
and phone sucks right now so I just have
to keep this on me at all times and next
thing is tied to go I spill things a lot
to be very clumsy so and I also hate
having food or like a stain on my shirt
but I hate it so I have to keep this
little mini time to go the big necessity
for me so I always help us all me and
then minutes down the street and I
thought these ones are the Christmas
from sashe or sage I mean they're okay
organic but I'm definitely something
better because they don't actually
really do anything but um they're good
the last two things I keep band-aids on
me band-aids are also a necessity
blisters cut yourself whatever always a
necessity the house there's a few those
flippers and then extra hair tie
what what do I have to say about a hair
tie you know you always need this I have
one on my wrist but I always keep it on
my purses as well and then for some
awesome stuff I usually just keep these
are the Ray Ban rounds I just usually
keep these I just usually keep these on
my head like this or on my shirt so I
don't actually usually put these in my
purse which is nice so I can have a
small purse or I just keep them in my
car so I don't have to keep those my
purse which is great but that isn't
that's all I keep in my bag done small
little purse absolutely love this purse
so great for summertime
