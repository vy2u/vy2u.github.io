turning off my alarm usually pretty
tired and then I will track anything
that you check like emails events urgent
if not I get straight out of bed well I
try to the first thing I do is I had
right to the bathroom and here I will
brush my teeth that's the first thing I
do in the morning I know so we will find
that kind of gross but I have to brush
my teeth first thing in the morning
because it's just like it just grosses
me out so much so I needa Sensodyne
toothpaste and I have this like charcoal
toothbrush that I love it's like super
soft toothbrush and then I will also
wash my face I have a skincare routine
so you can click the screen and it'll
take you to my skincare routine if you
want to see that video
then I head straight to the living room
this is a crucial stuff in my morning
and I try to get this in no matter what
my morning is like I why you could just
in my office there whoops I sit down and
I read a chapter of the book Zen mind
beginner's mind I've been doing this for
a while I took a break in the summer but
this is a very crucial part to my
morning so I take this book and I read a
chapter of just restarting the book and
then I meditate for ten minutes I can
usually only get ten minutes in but
actually as long as I can really
meditate for right now but this is like
a very crucial part time morning and it
just keeps me balanced and focused and
then after meditation I will throw in
some music right now I've been loving me
1975 you can follow me on Spotify I
think my username is Allegra Shaw and I
make playlist monthly and then I am
taking vitamin C and vitamin C because
those are crucial during a Canadian
winters let me tell you okay so this is
a pretty standard in my morning I make
ice lemon water every morning and then
I'll sit this while I make other things
or if I if I'm running around that
morning I still will make a nice lemon
water and just boiling some water to
make coffee and back on the coffee guys
the tried the no caffeine thing didn't
work and then what I have just started
doing is I made a huge batch of Steel
cut out so I'm just heating them up I
don't have a microwave so I have to heat
them up on snow some shouting some
almond milk into that so it'll heat up
nicely on top of stove and then cutting
up some strawberries I'm going to add
that into my steel cut outs as well this
takes like no time at all just heating
it up on the stove
when I initially made the steel-cut oats
I also put chia seeds and flax into the
mix so that's in the steel-cut oats as
well and cinnamon as well so now I'm
splitting to a bowl putting strawberries
I'm adding some coconut flakes and some
almonds as well almond places would be
better it's just in happening so I put
some full almonds and my breakfast so
this is the time where I will go on my
phone and like check emails and like
check Instagram Twitter social this is
my Instagram I'm like aschoff you want
follow me I've been hosting a lot about
video outfit photos so if you want to
see that then follow me and then also
like check Twitter or Facebook you know
all that good stuff my Twitter to like a
shop I say funny things on Twitter and
then like my breakfast and have a little
time to myself
then I have to actually look like a
human so I'll drink my coffee usually
while I get ready ready so I'm just
putting on makeup I'm going to update my
everyday makeup routine for you guys it
should be up this week so I will do that
for you but I'll just get ready and then
I've heard in my coffee I will mouthwash
is everyone so concerned about my breath
and Nate and then I head back into my
room and I make my bed I kind of need to
make my bed every morning it just makes
me feel clean and like organized if I
don't make my dad I feel very honored
that so I'm just just making my bed
I then get dressed like a normal person
does just drawing on jeans and a t-shirt
this morning and then I am just laying
out pajamas that I usually wear for that
night so I'll be easy and ready and cozy
when I go to bed that night and then I
always have to close out my closet is a
freaking mess
and then I start my day this morning I
just was on the computer and I was doing
emails and not stuff but I was just
working from home so I didn't have to go
anywhere so I'll just continue to drink
lemon water and that's it thank you guys
so much for watching I really appreciate
it P summer love you all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
