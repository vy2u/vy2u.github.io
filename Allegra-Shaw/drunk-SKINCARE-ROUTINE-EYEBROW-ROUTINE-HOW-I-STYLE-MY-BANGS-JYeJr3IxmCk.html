little drunk I've had a few glass of
wine it's being honest to the off-white
Jimmy Choo bent and it was really fun I
am going to change it to a rope and I'm
gonna do my night time skincare I
thought that'd be a good night to do it
because I want to make it fun and then
tomorrow I'm gonna do my morning
skincare so I will do the bowl both
skincare things I broke out by broken I
have to it's literally so much fun my
face it's probably the most annoying
thing I ever heard
I'm gonna use this jojoba oil this is
now solution to Ho boil 1 percent pure
organic moisturizing oil I heard that
this was really good to take off your
makeup but I think coconut oil although
I'm gonna show you some other products I
have really been loving the origins
original skin cleansing makeup remover
she'll be with willow-herb that's a
great makeup remover I also loved the
Dermalogica pre cleanse and that was
just but for the last about a month
i-i've been using oil because it
apparently is like better for your skin
if you're prone to breakouts than
coconut oil so I couldn't take a little
cotton pad these organic cotton pads and
I just removed my makeup like this do I
think that this is the best makeup
remover I don't this whole thing of a
hobo oil was 4 bucks so I mean you can't
really go wrong with that I got mine off
I heard but yeah you can't really go
wrong with that I just feel like you
have to use a lot of product to get your
makeup off right I'm gonna fish off this
hobo oil bottle and then I'm gonna go to
another one
I met Lily Aldridge Aldridge tonight
she's so sweet
I really like didn't know what to say to
her so I was like hi I'm Allegra it's
great to meet you I was when we couldn't
get a picture she was like yeah
I love yours but like I didn't know what
else to say
I'm really bad at making conversation in
general but especially with people who I
literally know nothing about
so I almost my makeup off and then for
cleanser I have been using one of three
things I either use the Kiehl's
calendula deep cleansing foaming facial
wash I usually keep this one in the
shower just start using the suave
hydrating cleanser this stuff is amazing
or I have a mess soy face cleanser I
also love this so I'll probably stick
with these two one in the shower and one
on my sink and then this one is just my
least favorite over three so I'd wash my
face now oh now you can really see the
two sits on my face I feel like I would
have taken my makeup better if I wasn't
okay so I'm gonna talk about exfoliators
eye deep exfoliate once a week and then
my daily exfoliates I'm gonna daily
exfoliate today okay so for the diva
later I use the caudally gentle buffing
cream mixed with the Carly mask glycolic
peeling mask and I mix these two
together on the back of my hand I put I
like rub it into my face and then I
leave it on my face for 10 minutes I was
told by the facialist to my facial that
this was a great exfoliator for me and I
do this about once a week sometimes
twice depending on my skin for daily
exfoliator I just started using the
glossy a solution the exfoliating skin
Perfector and I literally just started
using it I was using another one before
that was this is a H a pH a pH ace of
salicylic acid salicylic acid acne
treatment I was just using an H a before
I don't really know what it was I just
like started using those I heard good
reviews which is probably not the
smartest thing so I just put this on a
cotton pad and I just rub it all over my
face no reviews on this yet because I
just started using it but I hope it
works I hope I heard the results that
everyone else had
I think these breakouts are caused by me
going off birth control but it could
a variety of things I had a big weekend
last weekend my skin isn't react well to
that
well that dries the masks that I love
are the purifying mask by caudally this
one and the origins out of trouble
10-minute masks these I use once a week
but I've been actually use it as a spot
treatment tonight so when this feels dry
I'll go into the rest of my skin here
the first thing I use is the caudally
essence did a lot of research onto my
skin care routine and Gotha nice does my
favorite skin care youtuber I think
she's so knowledgeable and she really
like just knows her shit and I
appreciate that so I get most of my
information of it skincare off of her
but I've gone to a lot of facialists and
stuff as well next I'm using me the
ordinary buff a serum it's a multi
technology peptide serum I always try to
you know put my hands up it's better for
your skin pressing things in instead of
rubbing really hard let that dry a bit
and golfing nice this thing is like you
go thin too thick so that's what I do
that's a water-based serum so I did that
one first and then I go on with my
retinoid this is Agron active retinoid
2% emulsion from the ordinary ordinary
products are so inexpensive it's amazing
I'm not sure if I should be using this
on a cotton pad or not but I try to keep
it pretty precise on the areas that I
need so I'm not like getting in my eyes
and stuff gonna let that sink in and dry
and then go in with the keels powerful
strength line reducing concentrate this
is a 12.5% vitamin T plus hyaluronic
acid I think I really like this stuff
this stuff just came out they sent it to
me but it seems like it's doing a really
good job it keeps my skin feeling really
soft you should be very gentle a my skin
- and I'm putting this products on I
could then go in with an oil but I don't
think I need it right now but I have the
drunk elephant rule oil the ordinary has
this for $7 this is 50 so I probably
the ordinary one because I know I
blocked out about that one I no idea
what I was thinking and then the next
step is moisturizer someone use the limb
edge moisture cream for a normal to dry
skin I don't have the gel one I have two
just like the normal normal one some
people have said that they really like
the gel one better so maybe some
research under that I will probably
repurchase this because I really like it
for eye cream for night eye cream I'm
using the suave I repair cream you get
the drugstores but 20 bucks it's pretty
good very hydrating this is I don't they
have a night cream as well but I just I
hadn't I hadn't heard any reviews on it
I got this one instead but maybe I'll
try the night cream next and I just
focus that on the eye area I also put it
on top of my lids heard multiple
different things about if you should put
things on top I've heard multiple
different things if you bring eye cream
up to this area seems like everyone has
a different opinion can you do so that's
it for skincare since I do have sits
right now because my body hates me I'm
going to you I'm gonna use the OH
first I'm gonna show you if you have
cystic acne the arena verlo anti cyst
acne treatment is phenomenal like
phenomenal I think it's really good so I
have like a cystic acne people right
here so I'm just gonna put some and then
I'm gonna use the origins out of trouble
10-minute mask as a spa treatment today
it doesn't look like have anything oh it
looks like I'm getting something there
this thing is really good because if you
feel like you're getting a cystic you
can put it on where you feel like you're
getting in my hormones are just out of
whack right now they don't think that I
have anything else but so that's it for
tonight that's what I'm gonna do you let
it dry I also use um little an edge lips
living mask for my nighttime lip lip
care I really love this stuff almost on
my first sure and I already have a
second jar
it just keeps my lips super hydrated I
love it I love the smell out the taste I
love everything about it I also have my
skin speak
extra extra dry and I don't have any
zits I put on the Lee - water sleeping
mask side table ready to go something
else that really helps my skin that I
feel like isn't talked about well two
things water drinking a lot of water I
mean I shouldn't say that I have good
skin right now because I don't but the
next thing is a humidifier this is the
Dyson humidifier I keep this in my room
and there's no water in it right now but
I a humidifier is amazing for your skin
good morning okay so normally I would
wake up and just hop right in the shower
and wash my face but I totally forgot to
do my hair oil in the stuff last night
so I'm gonna do about age of that this
morning and then I'm gonna do some work
while I get the sense and then I'm gonna
shower I do my speaker so let's go wash
this off my face with water just the
hair oh I've been using this is the blue
butterfly organic fortifying scalp serum
it's all natural I got this off of
holistic habits on YouTube she does
beautiful clear so I'm just gonna go to
my hands and kind of massage it through
my scalp so you can so just like put it
directly on your scalp and then a row
bitten I'm gonna put some coconut oil on
the ends I was looking at my hair for
when I was in high school my hair was so
long and I kind of want the really long
hair yeah once I don't do it again
yeah like real life and in grade 12 my
hair was so long but I haven't started
YouTube at that point so you would have
never seen it cut my hair off when I was
going difficult time why sir I need to
and cut my hair off and then started
YouTube because like it was just going
through so much shit because I'm not
washing my face right away I was going
to spray my video like star on my face
I'm gonna brush my teeth with this this
then I am going to do a little math I'm
gonna do the colony purifying mask press
warm water on your face you want to open
up your pores but I have just not gonna
do that and just way too lazy and they
just had a crazy day job ooh I have one
of those little brushes they can put
your face masks on with
it's the morning okay did this part of
my face now I'm gonna go like drink a
coffee
I'm gonna go meditate and then I'm gonna
probably do some emails and then I'm
gonna come back and shower no we can do
morning skincare in her back I totally
missed my laser appointment this morning
I answered the phone they called me and
I looked orthotic oh my god like
everything came rushing back that had an
appointment and I answered the phone oh
my god I'm so sorry she was like yeah
we're gonna make sure you're okay
sometimes having a glass of water I know
you just drink water before you drink
coffee but I just don't wait so I wash
my hair today was a hair washing day I'm
gonna do my skincare and then do my
bangs so we usually actually really like
to pluck my eyebrows I do my eyebrows
myself I need to put my eyebrows when I
have makeup on I know what's so weird
but I feel like the hairs just come out
easier probably isn't like the best
thing for you but their hairs to my
t-zone like see them better and you
really need new tweezers fuck my
eyebrows about like three times a week I
always get the travel ones because if I
get two sets I get the point he said
tutors were there and this for the same
price it's like a normal tweezer and
that I have to replace them all the time
so me and never really don't save me any
money
I know some people like to have like the
most perfect clean eyebrows and I just
don't care that much okay so after that
I go in with an eyebrow razor and that's
how I clean up my eyebrows some people
might be scared of this but it's just
the way I like to do it basically I
would just burst them up like this and
then trim then I brush them down which
they really don't need that much for me
so I'm gonna go in with my Carly essence
it's basically the same stuff I do at
night I wash my face in the shower and I
just washed it with this one of the
cleansers that I showed you last night I
wash like a soy face cleanser okay you
let that sink in and then I go in with
the buffet that's again
they go any with my vitamin C Nikhil's
one that I showed you last night
and then for eye cream I have been using
the all older Olay Olay
Henriksen been a bright eye cream I
really like this stuff I dropped it
actually the other day and it all
spilled out and I lost most of the
product I was literally devastated I
just really like the way it makes my
under eyes feel and look and how's this
like brightening aspect to it obviously
it's called banana bright but has this
like a shimmery kind of highlighting
aspect to it so it's a really nice date
time I cream and then for moisturizer I
use the Dermalogica pure light SPF 50
broad-spectrum and I check oh my god I
just ran out that sucks
this is I find a super lightweight
moisturizer it has SPF 50 in it and I
really just love it definitely
repurchase ink and that's it
okay so I have bangs so obviously you
guys know that and I'm kind of over them
but this is how I have been styling them
when they were shorter as well so this
is just how it goes so my hair's wet I
dry them so they're kind of in front of
my face they're so long now but I let
them dry like that and then go one with
the Aveda be curly has a seen this
before I give the waves a little pump up
so she oh my are super clean it the
curls are a little soft so it'll hold
very well but kind of just put this
through my hair and then go on with the
easy wave spray it never thought I'd be
saying this but I really like the way
wave spray better has better hold it
smells better makes my hair look nicer
but I want to finish this bottle so then
I go easy hair oil bring some moisture
back in from the D curly you could also
use a hydrating balm igk is a great one
and that's that so this is annoying but
this is literally how I let my hair dry
and then last Malisse I use inv I know
there's multiple different controversial
reviews on this but haven't had any
problems amazing for about three months
and I'm really happy of my eyelash like
so I only use this once a week now
instead of everyday I hope you're happy
that I did this on a day where I have
two zits so thank you guys so much for
watching I really appreciate it I'm
gonna go let my hair dry in front of my
face by this mark I just realize it and
say peace in love love you all
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
