night I know this is literally like such
a weird time to be filming a video but
honestly I was supposed to start filming
this like nine hours ago but I stupidly
started watching stranger things today
and well I binge watched the entire two
seasons in 18 hours so it's 1:00 in the
morning
anyways up you guys it's amber welcome
back to my channel and if you're new
this is the perfect video for you guys
because today I thought it'd be fun to
go ahead and do a quick little like get
to know me tag kind of video because
honestly I've never really done one of
those before and despite the fact that I
put my like entire life on the internet
and tell you guys everything I feel like
there's still a couple of things that
you might not know so anyways without
further ado if I could stop thinking
about Steve Harrington for literally
even ten minutes so I can film this
video ten things you might not have
known about me
totally random side notes sitting here
in the dark by myself I'm like so afraid
the demo garden is just gonna like come
out of the walls and attack me why did I
watch that all day my gosh I sound like
such a nerd talking about all this I
really shouldn't put this on and get to
know me video but I guess now you know
I'm weird first fact I'm terrified of
Democrats but okay no I'm kidding I'll
give you guys some real facts so
starting out with fact number one since
the Olympics have been going on lately
I've been thinking about this one a lot
and I don't think I've ever really
mentioned it but I was actually a
competitive figure skater for almost a
decade when I was younger so uh yeah
I'll show you some old clips and videos
but it was so fun I loved it I started
when I was about six years old and did
it all the way till I was about 13 I was
actually even like the regional champion
in 2008 so not to toot my own horn or
anything but I was pretty good Ida
sparkliest funnest glarey outfit oh my
god I was like obsessed with all of them
it just felt like a princess every time
I was on the ice so I still have ice
skates I don't know if I can still
really like skate or not the last time I
went was in London that's oh I'm hardly
Olympic quality or anything but if
there's ever an ice Dancing with the
Stars sign me up I'll get the gold
Mirrorball trophy for sure
that's new row 2 is a little less
interesting but a lot of people don't
know this um yeah I actually went to
college and have a college degree I
graduated laude from Pepperdine
University with a degree in broadcast
journalism in 2015 so it was truly the
time of my life all of my best friends
to this day were all of my friends in
college
like literally Josh and me went to
Pepperdine together look at how funny
this is
Oh vintage photos he would literally die
if he knew that I showed this picture so
Shh don't tell him I was also tried out
in college so if any of you out there
there tried deltas don't they love to
you guys so contrary to popular belief
yes I do have a brain fact number three
Michael I grew up in Virginia with my
mom my dad who are still married after
28 years by the way look how cute they
are and my two little sisters with
basically a farm in my backyard it was
so funny I literally used to like go
swimming in the creek and overalls and
all sorts of cool stuff so you can see
some old pictures of that it was so so
fun like I had the best childhood in the
world I think that's part of the reason
I'm probably a vegetarian too because I
just love animals
up around them so yeah there you go I'm
still great at riding horses I could
totally milk a cow if given the
opportunity in the middle of Los Angeles
which I have no idea where you could do
that but yeah the best childhood ever I
loved every second of it
okay so this one's really stupid but I
actually get called out in this in my
videos a lot when I show my shoes and
people notice um I wear my socks inside
out but intentionally that little line
on the sock literally drives me nuts so
I just flip them inside out so I can't
feel it on my feet which I know it looks
kind of stupid in fact it looks like
really stupid but I don't care it's just
like a weird thing that I've always
always done so yeah if you ever see me
with my socks inside out in a video you
don't have to tell me I know and I did
it on purpose already some of you guys
might know this too because I mentioned
it before but before YouTube
my job was drum bow please drive or post
mates yeah a lot of people don't believe
me when I say that but in case you don't
know what post mate says by the way it's
like uber but you get food delivered to
you so like I could be sitting here me
like I want Taco Bell and I could like
press a button and some random person
would have to bring me Taco Bell and I
was the random person delivering it so
before he hit YouTube yeah that's what I
was doing driving around delivering
pizza at like 2:00 in the morning I've
made like $10 an hour but there was one
time it was totally worth it I delivered
food to Luke Hemmings not supposed to
say anything but I was like I love 5
seconds of summer and I definitely
freaked him out because he was just kind
of like so anyways you live in Los
Angeles and think I look really familiar
there is definitely a good possibility
that I brought you a doughnut at some
point if you ordered one already so this
next one honestly I wasn't even sure if
I should put this in here because I hate
talking about it
but I actually competed in pageants when
I was younger here's some old pics if
you want a really good throwback oh my
goodness look at that begged my mom for
years to let me be the one because I
really just wanted an excuse to own a
gown so finally she caved in and let me
do it I had a blast I loved them I even
won one time which is so funny because
I'm like
least poised person in the world but is
that I don't talk about it much because
as much fun as it was then I would never
compete in one again you know you don't
need a bunch of judges to give you a
crown to make you feel like you're a
queen it's what's on the inside that
counts
so anyways there's my two cents on that
but that's a part of my past that I
thought I'd share with you okay so this
one um it's not really gonna be a shock
to you guys do you know I love shoes
I've shown you my shoes at all of my
videos I'm always shopping for shoes
picking out shoes talking about them
however I have only ever actually shown
you guys like maybe one fifteenth of my
total shoe collection I own hundreds of
pairs of shoes they're everywhere
they're all over my house I can't stop
buying them I just have random buckets
of shoes plain shoes glittery shoes
designer shoes cheap shoes designer
shoes I have literally hundreds of
thousands of dozens of pairs of shoes
like exactly low-key kind of a problem
but I love them so much they just never
get old to me so yeah um this is kind of
more like a confessional but yeah I'm
definitely a shoe hoarder a shoe whore
if you will
alrighty moving right along to the next
fact um this one's kind of weird but I
have never had a real serious boyfriend
before um I really never talked about
that just because I'm honestly like kind
of embarrassed about it it seems so
weird to me like I mean I've been on
dates before like I don't want you to
think that I'm like some you know not in
a corner but nothing that's just ever
really worked out long-term at all no
reason really in particular um aside of
the fact that I just like never really
met anyone that I really gelled with and
um honestly I mean it's kind of my fault
because I have really bad taste I like
like bad boys covered in the tattoos
don't treat your right kind of guys so
you know you don't really want to date
that so I guess that's kind of why but
yeah I've been single for god it should
can I even say that I've been single my
whole life I don't even want to admit
that on camera but I guess I just did so
there you go never had a boyfriend okay
this one's silly don't laugh but I have
had a near-death experience so let me
just explain let's kill so I was on
vacation with my family in Hawaii and I
went
scuba-diving which i love scuba diving
by the way and we went on this little
excursion through the reefs and when
we're down there they're like don't
touch anything blah blah blah and I was
like yeah okay but while we're down
there I see a super beautiful shell and
kind of like jewelry I'm like so drawn
to things that I think are beautiful so
I just you know went ahead and plucked
that off the seafloor and stuffed it in
my wetsuit so we did the whole scoop
machine and again and ride the boat back
to shore and then we take off the
wetsuits and I was like I forgot about
the little shell so I was like look what
I found under there was so cool and the
instructor literally freaks out like
smacks it out of my hand is like
screaming and I was like oh my god I
didn't know it was that serious to like
steal a shell off the seafloor
apparently turns out it was some super
poisonous snail crab thing that
literally will just jut out of the shell
and sting you and you die like
immediately and I just heard that
chilling in my wetsuit like sitting on
my left boob for a solid hours scuba
diving under the Seas so yeah me but to
say I was SuperDuper lucky that that did
not sting me I'm still to this day I
can't believe I was left had like mere
death by picking up a pretty shell but
uh yeah that's the stupid little story
of how you shouldn't pick up shells and
also I cheated death
shoutout to God for not letting that
thing sting me that would have been a
really lame way to die already feel the
grand finale fact number 10 honestly I
couldn't decide what to make this fact
because it's like there were so many
things that I felt like I could say but
they were all like boring like I'm
allergic to peanuts but that's not that
interesting and I can't talk about that
for more than two seconds so next fact I
used to be a music video vixen I'm
totally kidding but actually not really
kind of afraid did YouTube I was in a
couple of music videos if you guys ever
have seen the Janoskians one in real
girls eat cake I played a Snooki
look-alike in that which was so freakin
funny I was actually in a kpop music
video once which was also so funny and
honestly there are so many more but I
don't even like to know where they are
so if you're ever watching a music video
and you see someone who you think looks
like me yes it was me so there you have
it you guys those are ten little facts
that you might not have known about me
or maybe you did maybe you're telepathic
and you like already knew all of those
things hope you guys enjoyed
the silly little video because well I
did stay up till almost 3:30 in the
morning to film that so hope you liked
it but honestly I don't think I would
have been able to sleep anyway because
I'm like it's still so freed up from the
show so you know but I have to go to
sleep now or else I'm gonna get like
bags under my eyes and we can't have
that so I love you guys so so so so much
have a medical rest of your day go dream
of fabulous magical happy things that
are not strange or scary and I will see
you guys next time I love you kisses my
sweet beautiful baby angels XL
dah-dah-dah thanks for watching till the
end you have unlocked a bonus fact are
you ready
ninety-nine percent of the time that I'm
filming a video I'm wearing no pants
I don't like right pants are
uncomfortable and if I didn't just show
you that he had never know very sneaky
that is sneaky</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
