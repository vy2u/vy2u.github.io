hands and knees and asked him to help me

dreams because it's never too late and
anything you want in life can and will
come true if you truly believe in it so

than everything you imagined
but most of all it was the heir of all
of my wildest dreams coming true the
show Beauty because I'm breathing the
same air that someone from Jennifer
Lopez's team has breathed in last year I
couldn't even afford a ticket to Beauty
cotton so this year to be a featured VIP
guest that was just a dream in half so
thank you guys and best of all it was
the year I got to spend with you
and a lot has changed since I made that
first video but uh the one thing that
has stayed constant throughout the whole
journey is all of you guys I cannot
believe how wonderful you guys are to me
the support and the love and everything
means so much and no amount of
thank-yous will ever be enough to truly
explain how much you guys mean to me so
for now I will just say this of my heart
I love you guys more than you will ever
ever know and I know I said I had a
special surprise for you guys when I hit
1 million but it's not ready yet you

months to go but for now here is the
secret project that I've been working on
it's a necklace but I've cut the design
from the very beginning of my favorite
quotes from my mood board last year do
you guys remember this scene from that
video
this was my central quote of the year of
2016 it says what if it doesn't come
true but what if it does everything from
the box to the necklace everything was
custom designed by me so those will be
ready to order ASAP I mean they're in
the landing page for you guys to go
ahead and click on and sign up so I'll
let you know as soon as those are done
to remind yourselves to never give up
because you just never know you might be
making a video like the
and one last thing before I go I just
wanted to show you this on my mood board
this is my 2017 mood board and a moment
that I could have only ever dreamed of
look at this seven thousand three
hundred and forty subs I was here ready
