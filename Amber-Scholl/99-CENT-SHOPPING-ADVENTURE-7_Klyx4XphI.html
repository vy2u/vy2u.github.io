guys think of my Macklemore impression
hmm I know it's a little less than
impressive but I'm literally still so
mad at myself for not using any of those
jokes in my first shopping video what
was I thinking
so many good puns gone to waste anyways
what is up you guys
it's amber and welcome back to my
channel and today we are going on a very
exciting shopping adventure that I
promised you guys a long time ago and
then never got around to it but today we
are finally going to one of my favorite
stores in the whole wide world the
99-cent store oh I get excited just
thinking about it I discovered the
99-cent store back when I graduated from
college and heard LA no job and no
source of income it is literally
incredible they have everything all the
brand names stuff for 99 cents and it is
a bargain hunters dream
aka Disneyland no I'm kidding but whoo
yeah so bring your wallets kids it's
time to ball out a trip to an
alright hey before we go here is our
glamorous out for the day it's actually
really hot in LA right now but I really
wanted to wear this anyway so whatever
who cares about the weather fashion is
fashion so we've got this cool little
cropped hoodie thing I'm matching satin
hat from H&amp;amp;M I think it was like $12
this hoodie I got in London for like
five pounds some matching white leggings
I love these they're so cute I actually
got them from Nordstrom Rack I think for
like 11 bucks I'll try to find a link
and then look at these shoes baby my
toes really need a pedicure so ignore
that but super cute little rose gold
crystal II slides woo and he's been like
only 20 bucks so there we go that's the
final look
time to $0.99 oh I love you okay no more
random puppy distractions will actually
go shopping now but for now that was fun
oh here we are in 99 cents only store
I'm so excited okay here we go
does this not just look like Disneyland
oh my God look at this place oh so many
things so many things that I don't need
but I want but we're gonna focus all
right so I first discovered the 99-cent
store back when I graduated from college
and I know I talk about this a lot but I
was driving for post mates and I had
like two dollars to my name so visit
please with in life a saver like look at
all this already we're gonna grab the
cut and grab all sorts of other stuff my
my favorite thing to buy do you hear
that you guys
I knew I loved this place anyways like I
said my favorite thing to buy in here is
all the household things that you would
need anyway but you can get here for a
fraction of the price like look at this
all the brand name hand soaps for 99
cents so we'll grab us maybe two of
these actually they've got all sorts of
haircare sort of things Oh actually I
totally needed some safety pins so grab
those I need some new scissors too
actually which ones are actually these
are the cutest black and pink it's so
fun you got to dig a little but you can
find some Bayer name-brand stuff too
little makeup organizers makeup remover
wipes I really don't like doing makeup
videos but oh my god I think I need to
do a $0.99 for makeup video on the list
even got Instagram stuff insta ho 99
cent store lives on this is one of my
favorite oils the cleaning aisle mostly
because I hate cleaning no but um I do
love getting a good deal on cleaning
supplies because I do not like spending
money on cleaning supplies when I could
spend it on something else fun like a
look at all the sponges all the little
scrubber thingies so fun I really need
to clean my shower actually so we're
only gonna get one of these and pretty
sponges - Wow these are the most
aesthetic e sponges I've ever seen
they got air freshener hands grab some
of those best thing though
brand-name tissues not the tissues are
really that expensive anyway but why not
get them for 99 cents
we even got some fashion up in here to
be honest I've never tried these on
before but they actually look super cute
so why not aside of the tag dangling my
eyeball he's actually kind of fun holy
he's actually look like those saline
glasses Bounty's toilet paper and I'm
not gonna lie I do not recommend getting
the toilet paper from here I used to buy
it back in the day but it's just like
not soft enough even if you get the
Angelia softest kind so just for the
record splurge on that okay my all-time
favorite part of the 99-cent store it's
this aisle right here which you can't
read but it's the party aisle I mean who
doesn't love the party aisle but gift
wrap is super expensive and you can get
it here for half the price look at how
fun yay sparkly happy birthday wish we
got bows we got tissue paper we got fire
crackers which I don't know maybe I
wouldn't get those from here but pretty
gold birthday candles pink Solo cups the
Red Solo cups blue silk cups yellow Solo
cups dreams to look up some whites or
cups black Solo cups wow what an
aesthetically pleasing aisle basically
if you're having a party at the 99-cent
store is where it's at we got straws we
got plastic thingamajigger bombers and
we got balloons as you can see the
literal entire store there's lines with
them
this card reminds me of me and my
roommate's so much I'm gonna get it for
them they've super fun home decor stuff
too he'd be surprised like look at this
this is a little wall mirror so fun
if I had anywhere to put these in my
house but so cute all the picture frames
you ever wanted whoa baby
I never knew they had these hangers in
here but I've ID'd the literally all the
time from TJ Maxx and they're like $8
for eight so woohoo $1.99 score I'll
have to bring you guys back here when
there's a holiday coming up but the
holiday decor here is lit look at all
this ah like this is just the leftover
fourth of July stuff but look how cute
it is you could totally have a fun
little party with all this stuff and oh
my gosh for Christmas wait till you see
what they have 50 shades of America no
I'm kidding hmm I don't know what this
is but I felt like I couldn't walk by it
and not inclusion for fog so a mood all
right here we go back-to-school supplies
killer killer killer killer ahh oh my
god like look at these we got tape we
got mailing packages we got bubble wrap
to jump on when you're bored at night no
I'm kidding but when I was a kid I you
still have to do that but there's all
sorts of fun stuff including this weird
little penguin guy everything you ever
wanted to make your school supply
shopping and it's nice look how cute
this stuff is and loving it don't worry
be happy words to live by
this must be what it's like to be a
millionaire wandering around with no
concept of money
because you can just afford everything
amazing it's just so big and fun full of
adventures and pop will hold hold bouncy
balls in hula hoops I think this is the
only problem with the store is you end
up buying a bunch of stuff you don't
mean like yes I'm not as talented as I
was in my younger years what else can we
find in here mm-hmm
aisle 13 must be a lucky one look at
this
Tupperware heaven and it's cute pink so
funny I bought many of Oz many a cup
many a mug this one's a beautiful
matches me sort of all sorts of fun
kitchen supplies like I don't even know
what this is but I kind of want it we
got some drawer organizers boo these are
actually fun I love it I get this they
sell food here too honestly I wouldn't
really buy a lot of it but if you check
it out and it looks pretty good like
look at this fresh point of blueberries
for 99 cents
you get a steal where to next what I'll
shall I stop in I just lost and my
favorite thing to buy here razors
because razors are so overpriced
anything here the same ones for $0.99 we
even got the fancy toothbrush brands and
I could use a new loofah so we'll NAB a
new one of those look at my cart oh man
I could live in here oh now that we got
entirely too much stuff I think it's
time to go her look at this is this not
the most exciting thing of everything
thank you so much
alrighty guys there we go oops heavy

like stop in the middle the street to do
that but let's go home

straws very random got those scissors

some air freshener vanilla flavor
because I don't know it doesn't like to
smell like vanilla this is weird maybe
I'll just empty it all out okay
here we go so I got those little hair
clips right here I always use these when
I'm putting on my tanning lotion because
I don't like my hair to get in it um oh
I cut this fancy tooth whitening stuff
I'm really excited to try this it's
supposed to like amplify the whiteness
so I don't really know what that is but
that should be fun I've got some baby
wipes because I just like to have them
around the house those safety pins great

but I wanted to scrub stuff so get a
scrubber I got those razors I got me a
new loofah yay oh those banger hangers

fun and those to my closet

funny card that I liked I'm gonna give
this to my roommates when they get home
cuz they're gonna think this is
hilarious so that is all that I got and
bust up oh look at this
grand total 1757 incredible by the way I
thought it'd be funny to tally up what I
would have spent if I bought all this
stuff at like Target or CVS so check it
out so I went on CVS calm and added up
all of the same things put them in my
cart and check it out BAM grand total
$67 so I saved almost fifty bucks by
going to the dollar store pretty good if
I do say so myself I don't know why I
decided to lay on the floor like this I
just really wanted to shake it up I
guess but anyways uh there have you guys
