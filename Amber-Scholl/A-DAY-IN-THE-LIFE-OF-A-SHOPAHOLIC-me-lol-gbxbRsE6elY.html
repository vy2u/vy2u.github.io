nests all the time but for the day you
know why not it was pretty and plus uh
my house is a mess so I had to come
outside to film the intro but uh anyways
what is up you guys
it's amber welcome back to my channel
and today we're going to go on a little
bit of an adventure because honestly I'm
a little under the weather today I don't
feel a hundred and ten percent um so I
figured what would make me feel better
than a little bit of shopping so we're
gonna go shopping see what kind of
goodies we can find out on the town so
without further ado here we go shopping
okay as always before we get going here
is our outfit of the day we've got a
casual look today and we've got oh well
we got a white sports bra that's a
little see-through so I'm gonna cover
that up a little with my jacket which is
just like a forever 21 hoodie super cute
white leggings just for fun I love a
little matchy-matchy outfit and for
shoes we've got these oh yes honey I'm
totally kidding I'm not actually wearing
these um I just got them in the mail
this morning and I was just too excited
not to show you guys so I'm gonna change
it to some sneakers and then we can head
on out oh look how beautiful the sky is
Wow la takes my breath away every day
but alright so shopping yes alrighty so
what's our first stop going to be
can this is one of my favorite Kennedy
stories and honestly this little
supposed to be the first stop but I just
drove by it was like I actually could
totally go to candy so we're popping in
to get some wood for simple don't mind
if I do
oh my gosh this is just the cutest
little candy store in the world don't
look at everything
hmm gorgeous okay so we got being - what
else do we want a masterpiece okay let's
buy this oh I'm like a kid in a candy
alright next so we're just casually
gonna run into our car because I parked
in 20 minute parking so here we go well
since we're already doing a bunch of
weird nonsense that I don't need we're
gonna make a quick little pit stop oh
it's so beautiful
okay we're just gonna go in really
quickly wow I could get lost in here but
that's not what we're doing today oh the
beauty section it's still decorated for
Christmas which I don't personally mind
it looks beautiful
so I'm redoing my bathroom because you
guys know I just moved so I need to
redecorate some things so I just wanted
to pick up some aesthetically pleasing
makeup to put on my bathroom vanity look
at these bottles they're so beautiful oh
okay anyways I saw these on Instagram
and I just thought the aesthetic of them
was so beautiful so I want to pick up a
couple of those really quick ooh this
one is pretty very pink what do you
think
Hey alrighty so there we go on to the
next stop
alrighty next stop is Joanne's because
I'm going to do a craft so okay we go
alrighty so I'm not gonna tell you what
I'm doing yet because it's a surprise
but I need some spray paint
I don't really know there's this many
kinds so uh I guess I'll just pick one
herim her might actually need white for
this so that one looks like it will do
okay I also want to get a foam ball
which for some reason are extremely
overpriced but uh can you guess what I'm
making no but this is our gonna use I'm
so cheap so I'm gonna Google a coupon
alrighty next up Oh getting darker I'm
gonna be shopping until the Sun Goes
Down again oh I'm just gonna show you
this guy like six hundred times in this
video okay anyways back to shopping
though but Wow
look at that alright so probably our
last stop before the Sun Goes Down
Sally's Beauty Supply
I just gotta get something real quick in
here I love mister I could honestly
spend just so much time in here but the
only thing I need today is some face
razors uh-huh perfect we're just gonna
grab like pokey all of these I don't
remember if I've mentioned it on here or
not but yeah I shaved my face too so uh
I'll do a video on that at some point if
you want to see it but for now we're
just gonna get these and uh see if we
can hit a couple more places to
everything closest this is such a weird
assortment of things okay whew there we
go
now next point of interest that's such a
great day we're having a great time I
feel better already even though I don't
even know what's wrong with me I just
felt like sick it was weird but you know
nothing a little shopping campus all
right so since we're already on the
train and buying weird stuff that
shouldn't really be in a video we're
gonna go ahead and buy some more weird
stuff it doesn't need to be filmed so uh
where is that stuff I have a coupon for
some vitamins so I'm gonna get some
vitamins I literally have no idea why
I'm showing you this but whatever we're
gonna go ahead buy some more tampons cuz
I'm out possibly some nails to hang a
shelf so we'll find the nail section Oh
honestly I don't know if this was what I
was looking for but we're gonna get it
and hope that works alrighty so we're
ringing these goodies up here we're just
racking up the bags today and
Oh would you look at that it's dark and
we are not even halfway done yet so on
to the next and Bodyworks because I knew
that after the holidays they'd be having
some great sales Wow Wow so much on sale
but I actually want to get a candle so
oh perfect
my favorite all right II got that now to
the next place
well since we're in the mall where
should we go alrighty we're running out
of space in here but we will not tire we
are dedicated shoppers and we still got
a couple stops to go woohoo this looks
so creepy with the lighting anyway so
next stop we are heading up to Goodwill
cuz I am looking for a vase I love
really eclectic things so I thought
maybe they would have what I'm looking
for I want like a crystal vase thing Wow
they actually have lots and lots of
stuff this would be cool but again might
want it to be a vase too so hmm hey this
is actually really close wow I actually
really didn't know if it was gonna work
or not
but great I'll take it back about 4
bucks a steal the heck kind of plant is

last stop Sephora oh wait what it's

so I don't how funny is this my
apartment building has shopping carts
for when you buy too much stuff so
needless to say this is the perfect
thing for me duh duh no no no oops
sir sir no no no by the way I decided to
go to bed and film the hall the next day
so time flash-forward it's tomorrow so I
didn't call this a shopping spree for no
reason I actually did get quite a bit of
things so uh we'll just go ahead and get
started
alrighty so here's what we got I
actually ended up going back so for this
morning and picking up the oil control
spray that I needed so that was great
that's what I did earlier um what else

these pumpkin cupcake candles because it
just smells so good oh my god Wow they
