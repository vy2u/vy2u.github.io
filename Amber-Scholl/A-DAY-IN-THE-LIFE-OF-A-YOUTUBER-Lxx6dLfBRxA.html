my dirty bedroom that I really need to
clean but whatever yesterday was
Thanksgiving so I'm gonna get myself a
little bit of slack on that just been
sitting around eating any disease that's
not what this vlog is about but it is
about being thankful because for those
of you who've been following me for the
last I guess like 30 days spanning the
entirety of my youtube career you guys
know that my life has changed quite a
bit in that one I ferment went from
having like zero people watching my
videos to almost a quarter of a million
of you guys so that is literally insane
and I've never really been more thankful
for anything in my life because you have
changed my world completely I got to
quit on my other horrible jobs I had
like four jobs I was literally driving
four-post mates and it was if you want
to hear vlog on that I will do that at
some point but it was miserable um but
anyways so I thought I would take you
guys around with my new life a little
day and what being a youtuber is like
because I've got my bunch of questions
about what I'm up to on a daily basis so
here we go I thought I'd show you so Dan
the life of a youtuber vlog beginning
right now
all right the first thing I do when I
wake up is I will edit some videos for
you guys so I literally will edit in
heels on my bed like a crazy person but
this outfits really cute actually I will
show you this in a second but yeah so
that's what I will do I also spend a ton
of time on my email I'm always answering
7,000 emails like look at this this is
just in the last hour I always wake up
to literally hundreds of emails I also
spend a ton of time on YouTube it's
Black Friday today oMG I'm so excited
um so I will spend an hour in the
morning and an hour at night going
through the comments on my videos and
responding to as many as I can so yes I
do my best to read every comment however
even with the spending two hours a day
just doing that I still don't really get
to all of them so I'm sorry if I miss
yours but no I appreciate it and I love
you so much and it's the thought that
counts so I feel it spiritually I feel
that you're sending me love I promise
all right so we're just going to go run
some errands but first I want to show
you the full-length version channel and
Kourtney Kardashian one of her most best
looks her best looks in my opinion I
know how to speak I promise you it's
just not sometimes so there we go got my
Kourtney Kay look and we're going to go
out on the town thanks oh here we go oh
yeah I forgot everyday it's like
freaking Christmas I don't even remember
ordering this but alright bring that
inside so my roommates don't kill me oh
look at sunshiny beautiful LA even in
the midst of winter freakin stunning
here okay guys so this is my errand of
the day um look at all of these you
don't can't really tell what these are
but these are all fake lashes it's so
fun they have literally everything you
could ever want so this is the kind of
errands that I run on a daily basis just
getting all sorts of weird beauty things
so we're here at Sammy's camera super
cool place just one of the many weird
errands that normal people wouldn't have
to run but here I am yeah yeah booyah
hell yeah like this is a weird errand -
look at this guy I got a peel box
woohoo so there's nothing in it but you
can officially send me mail because I
have little golden keys to my very own
books okay errands done niat lunch I'm
starving alright guys so this is the
fancy cult grocery store that I met the
really hot boy in that I went on the
date with Cameron E at the time but this
is my favorite cursory store in the
world oh my god it's like heaven in here
oh my God look at it amazing their
prices to match but it's so good
Brussels sprouts and the chocolate
cookie definitely so weird and mind you
look at this these were five tall such a
ripoff but so delicious alright guys so
we are in route to the event in Asia
she's driving because I'm all easy okay
and now usually we would be blaring
music however you blaring literally
blaring but YouTube will cite you for
copyright infringement and will take
down your video so we're just gonna sit
here think of that vlogging what a day
we can sing some songs oh I can have you
know anyone stop right now thank you
very much
I need some by spice girls Wow
I'm love yourself honey love yourself
look at how beautiful Ellie is this
sunset by the way this event is 1.2
miles away from my house and we have
been in the car for 20 minutes it's
there a reason why these buses him to be
here probably not impending traffic
ruining everyone's day
he looks so demonic with the red look
it's like fella right where we is not
anywhere all right so this is the event
today we got Asia killing it over there
looking so interested we get our nails
done get our hair done that's why I love
these things are literally so fun and
you can see them yo and there's always a
staff photographer hello fun tag me okay
let's investigate let's see what's
upstairs
looks like something fun I almost just
fell down the stairs oh look there we
are look at us glamorous legs stepping
really awkwardly I practically just
killed myself doing that walking up the
stairs okay
pretty raised oh dear Fighting's from
the top of the world so I didn't
introduce her in the car because I'm
crude and I'm obviously
my friend because you know I'm always
alone that's just in videos in life I'm
not alone I almost fell into I know but
in life I'm not always alone and this is
my BFF Asia and she actually over like
99% of the time so it's weird that she
has been in a video yet hi we are here
at one of the many little events that we
go to as a YouTube community so here we
are at the Pioneer but we are literally
hi except not on from your height on
being near off hi I'm here we are just
high as it up top is what I meant this
is not something that okay so anyway
yeah we're going to adventure around and
kind of trouble we can get into and I'll
take you with me as we do all sorts of
nonsense I'm not going to leave you the
video of your beard okay here we go I'm
here event
yes I'd note we were just blocking the
stairs filming that and these ladies
were so unamused it was hilarious anywho
Zee you can get a better view of the
event here um but side note look it so
stinkin cute
shoes are oh my god I will do a video on
these because guess what these are
definitely a dupe so I'll show you those
in a sec but yeah Oh feet goals yes
neither of us can dance so actually see
for yourself okay that's enough of that
back to what we're supposed to be doing
right so this is the grand star of the
events that we're at today some
here which
apparently is just some really smart
near and it's pretty oh look at that it
matches my ring rose-gold Oh
so yeah let's see if I can mess around
with it see what I can do here we go
we're going to test my skin here line my
eyes up hello
I already know this is going to be super
unflattering okay oh boy what a mugshot
wife in jail for killing a strange
husband oh it's going to analyze my feet
red spots wrinkles and you can see it's
like all Smart Touch or not Smart Touch
Wow look at this is so cool Oh got my
pores Annalise is literally the coolest
thing why do I have 97 wrinkles no not
not 97 it's 100 - 3.45 so good oh we are
so I have 3.45 wrinkles percent off
wrinkle Wow that's good to know
can see we can run the makeup off it
I've been a part of Asians going
courtesy of all of this stuff that is
just sitting here so naturally we have
to play with it not sure touch all this
stuff but we're going to do it and voila
wow I am so what we did here with a
winged liner we put some lash lon
eyebrows a very nice mommy look fuller
we just got too scared to actually touch
anything
so we'll just go get our nails done and
set free manicure um because my nails
looked bad today so check it out oh my
gosh look at her nails
Twitter makes everything better this
bitch knows what's up look at the
slayage in here uh-huh oh yeah Wow Wow
honestly Instagram okay oh yes glamorous
we going downstairs yes bitches you
tonight uh-huh I'm gonna fall down the
stairs okay the best thing about events
like this is they always have food and
look at this it's all like veggie
friendly hell yeah I will definitely be
having a lot of fat don't know and they
also always have drinks oh my gosh look
at how fun I really don't drink very
often so I usually don't drink anything
in these always the classy lady I'm
gonna get some water
what is this oh this is some reason it
looks like a cat but it's not definitely
it's not again but here we go
very dapper men here to help us out
today which is another favorite feature
of these events the other best thing
about these events is you get a present
one present on your bed we get our nails
done get presents also I'm going to take
like 7000 minutes because you never know
when you just might meet them okay we're
gonna get run over by a car okay okay
alrighty but yeah by the way it's a
Tuesday so that is the other thing about
like not really having a full-time job
anymore
um is that I keep getting all the day's
confused I don't know if it's Monday
Tuesday Wednesday Saturday they're all
the same to me at this point but yeah
this was just a random Tuesday night in
LA pretty cool um yeah so I will spend a
lot a lot a lot of time editing videos
into the wee hours of the morning
it is literally currently 2:30 a.m. that
is why I have so many spelling errors in
all of my videos it's because it's
literally the middle of the night you
guys so I'm just tired when I'm editing
so that is how I will usually close out
my day is making new videos for you guys
um oh god but for now I'm like so tired
I think I am gonna just wrap it up here
so yeah I'm trying to can't even think
of an outro okay but thanks alright so
this is weird I'm gonna film an outro um
before I've even had my day because I
want the lighting to be cohesive and I'm
like OCD about that anyways so here we
are I hope you enjoyed my day even
though while I'm filming this I don't
even know what happens in it yet but I'm
sure it's gonna be a good time because
it's always an adventure of some sort
with all of my nonsense so also I just
wanted to say um from the genuine bottom
and depth of my heart I love you guys so
so much and thank you thank you for
caring about my life and caring about
all my silly little videos and all my
nonsense it is genuinely the purest joy
of
my soul to share things with you so
