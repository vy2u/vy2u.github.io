that you're supposed to be doing right
now that you're watching this instead
and procrastinating hmmm well anyways
sougarret thanks for watching so what's
up guys it's amber and welcome back to
my channel and if you're new hello
greeting for me and my beloved shoe wall
so you guys know that I am known for all
my over-the-top wild outfits and taste
in fashion so I'm getting a lot of
questions about what the heck do I wear
on an everyday basis and the answer is
it's no different I'm over-the-top and
wild just in slightly more casual
clothes so today I thought it'd be fun
to go ahead and show you guys my version
of a casual look book and show you all
the outfits that I wear on an everyday
day today average go into the Trader
Joe's running errands basis but I warn
you it's not really all that casual so
here we go a not so casual casual look
hi um here we go look number one kicking
it off very extra in my visual styles so
just look was actually inspired by a
news Kylie Jenner you might recognize
the look from her most recent Instagram
post the story about this wet shirt is
by global night because I wanted to buy
it and it was a cool $1,000 so I just
went ahead in my local embroidery shop
and had them make me one all of my own
so this was for 21 20 bucks this cost me
20 bucks so a $40 sweatshirt
not too bad DIY fashion i pair it with
some fabulous thigh high boots because
who gives a flying I can't for on
YouTube but you know okay I look at the
middle of the summer if you want to look
sexy and fabulous go for it so also to
go on under the sweatshirt which is
really long as you can see I went ahead
and grabbed some black shorts from 5 or
21 these are super cheap cool I think
there are like three dollars they have
like place on the bottom so you can't
see those but just in case you're like
oopsie your whole ass isn't out so that
is basically this tada
look number two baseball wives rainy day
chic I don't even know what I mean but
here we go so this look you can see from
head to toe I've got quite the guitar
going on here on the top I have this
white tank top tube top thing that I
wear literally all the time I'm obsessed
with it I got it forever 21 years ago
for like $3 and I still wear it all the
time
it's same with these these are forever
21 leggings in white and I have this
super cute little pink jacket it looks a
lot like those Instagram ones but I just
personally don't really like camel that
much so I thought I'd get it in pink and
wear it the same way so you can see it's
super cute it's just like a casual
little pink jacket it looks great with
the blue like let's just have a moment
of silence for this for a second Oh
amazing I went ahead and had to look
with a hat because I love hats but this
one is pink and satin and matches the
look so I look super cute and again
what's fun about looks like these if you
can totally quickly dress them up like
row on some cool pink booties and there
you go casual insta body ready to go to
wherever the heck it is
you're going in this oh my gosh can you
just tell from the shoes alone that this
next look is going to be up smash so
alright so from this lookbook you can
tell that I obviously love crop tops but
this is such a cute look so this is
literally such a fun thing because again
just like regular jeans white jeans are
so onto rated don't be afraid to wear
them you guys they make your body look
poppin they're so stinking cute these
are I think from Zara actually I would
have to just do some sunglasses on my
head because that's like an easy
accessory and this is just a green tank
top again from forever 21 it was like
three dollars all of it a beautiful
neutral that I think also gets
overlooked a lot so check them all if it
looks great on all skin tones like mine
the white jeans and then of course these
bigger shoes you can dress up anything
look at how cute these are oh my good
goalie Kosh Pressly's darling
oh girl you look so sporty did you just
come from the gym when I look at my
highlight you think I just came from the
gym no I came from my house so one of my
favorite looks in the world is the
pretending you workout look so this is a
very casual very cute
all grey outfit 50 shades of grey except
it's really just one shade of brave
featuring a white hat anyway rambling so
this is just a great little terry cloth
crop top paired with again some forever
21 grey leggings these are great by the
way I've had these for years and they
were like 11 dollars and all they do is
make your booty look popping and the
rest of you look great
of course don't forget to make your
workout attire extra extra with all the
specially glitters in the world can
throw on a fund of what we had because
who doesn't want to look like a bunny
rabbit all the time so that is basically
this look except for the absolute best
part about this which is spider
mushu's look at this are these literally
not the coolest shoes you've ever seen I
got them downtown for like $30 yesterday
I like them so much I got them in gold
too so now I have a whole little crew of
sparkly kicks and now off to the gym
just kidding No
so next oh no no no hello I'm ready for
the business meeting no not really
clearly at all anyway so this is one of
my all-time favorite looks ever is denim
on denim on denim and especially to
shake it up and do it in white
just like so trendy and so fun so this
look is some really teensy tiny white
booty short and this is a super cute
with a white denim crop jacket you can
see their drips on the side and it comes
up so it just kind of makes like the
whole looks just a little bit a little
bit groovy earth and here's the story
about the bodysuit this is actually so
funny so as you can see this is very
like bralette lingerie inspired I
actually got this epic Toria secret it
is lingerie but I don't care that's not
going to stop me from wearing it in
public as for shoes for this to be
honest I would be lying if I said I
wasn't going to wear heels with this
because I would I know that makes it a
little less casual but just the nude
shoes to make your legs look a little
longer and more fabulous you could
totally wear it with some sneakers too
and look just as cute were worm octopus
and we're at your service
no la I'm here for the Netflix and chill
no okay so I mean kind of anyways this
is actually something I've totally worn
in a lookbook before but I love this so
much I just figured I would throw it
into my casual look book too
basically all this is is a cute little
crop top with some matching shorts and
then a fun little robe thing because I
am obsessed with bedtime attire for the
daytime because I know why not fun so I
went ahead and paired this with some
fluffy slides just to accentuate the
kind of vendor me feel and now I can
review all of the town while being
casual cozy and nice in fact I'm gonna
like fall over but you ready to run a
marathon no just getting ready to clear
the runway okay so this is as in next
look very casual sporty kind of chic has
very adidas sides I suppose you could
say with the jacket so all this look is
is basically just a plain black bando
and the same black leggings I was
wearing from forever 21 earlier they
were like three dollars and so is this
is like two bucks
this little crappie sport jacket so fun
looks very adidas s I actually bought
this in my shopping blog so you can see
that it comes with matching pants and
stuff but I figured I'd rather wear it
like this because I like that these are
tight I paired it with some super cool
gold cakes because that like really
spices up an outfit I bet I hadn't
thrown a hat with this - because the
cure to any bad hair day is a and that
is this look I left this outfit
whoo but um but um okay so here we have
the collected boss lady running from her
mafia boyfriend okay that was specific
anyways so here is our next look and
this is seriously one of my favorite
looks because genes on a teacher are so
underrated it's ridiculous they can look
so thinkingyou it's all about how you
spend them so here you can see I
literally just tied up a plain white
t-shirt from forever 21 is so cute let
my black bra sleep through and of course
these Bangor fitting pants I went ahead
and paired the pants with some super
cool black booties the ones from my DIY
designer shoe video so that adds a
little bit of flair the fancy designer
inspired sunglasses made by yours truly
so I look at Tracy Tracy fabulous
literally for like seven dollars I don't
want to hear you can't look chic while
being lazy and cheap all at the same
going from baseball wives just
basketball alive I think I just say that
because these hands so if look number
would have another one and as you can
see it's very very slinky and shimmery
my two favorite things so first off
we've got this top which is basically
just kind of looks like a bralette but
it's actually made of satin so it's
super pretty and looks much nicer than
it kind of looks on camera I promise you
a super can't there's like 30 bucks I
think from some Australian boutique and
then I have these pants that I am
literally obsessed with I have them in
black and pink and like 4 other colors
you can see they're like a shimmery kind
of satiny kind of color and it's a
really nice shade of pink throw on the
matching satin bomber for extra look
serving and boom you are shiny basket
full honey boo boo doom I don't even
have basketball but I promise you I'm
like so bad at playing it's a joke so
here is the next look so this one is so
so stinking cute you can see this
awesome little crop top II thing it's
like the cutest thing ever I'm literally
obsessed with it you can see the side
there like this we got the little
crisscross the action super cash got
some sneakers some leggings what are we
feels like you're in pajamas but also
you look Trigg
I don't know why did this but you get
the point all right so this next look is
like very ridiculous but we TC these
pants I couldn't just like not include
you so are you ready for this so
basically these are a giant bedazzled e
sparkly sweatpants and I cannot get it
off of em so you guys are going to ask I
would actually wear this out and the
answer is AB so freaking gluttonous very
are that you guys that is my version of
a casual everyday lookbook I hope you

loved filming it for you a side note I'm
sorry I look literally so sweaty in

say I'm not actually sweaty and it's
just the camera and the lighting but no

million degrees in my apartment and I
