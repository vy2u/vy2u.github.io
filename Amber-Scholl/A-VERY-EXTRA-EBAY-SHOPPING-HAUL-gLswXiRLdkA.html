looked bald in my intros because I wore
my hair in a ponytail I swear what is up
you guys
amber welcome back to my channel and
today not only am I not bald but I also
have lots of new things to show you not
that those two things are really related
at all but whatever so today we are
doing an eBay haul because honestly I
wasn't even really planning on doing
this video I just have recently become
obsessed with buying things on eBay so I
figured you know I would just go ahead
and show you what I got not further ado
here we go a very extra but I didn't put
that in the title because I figure do
you guys just knew that already
eBay shopping home alright so as you can
see I literally got so much stuff some
of it I haven't even opened yet so I'll
look in that live in action on camera
with you guys but we're just gonna go
ahead and start with one of the coolest
banger deals that I got this week look
at this you guys remember this photo I
posted up this Tom Ford and perfume on
my Instagram ruler this little mini
bottle of that perfume is three hundred
and ten dollars so uh needless to say I
did not purchase that but they also had
an even bigger giant bottle that was a
quality $850
so did you snap that picture in the
store and left and then looked for it
online and look what I found
brand-new in the box I know my name is
broken what can you do whatever the rest
of them look fire but like oh my gosh
literally this is so well exactly what
it says granted the only catches the
bottles empty and there's not actually
any perfume in there but who cares I
just wanted it for decoration anyways as
a collectible they only made a couple of
them so in a couple years this will be
worth quite a bit anyways so an
investment and I got this very cool and
then denied bucks so I don't really know
what that's actually a bargain or not
it's still really overpriced but and
really twisted over-the-top shopping
logic technically I did save seven
hundred bucks or at least that's what
I'm gonna tell myself super fun um what
else did we get lots of things haven't
we open this I just opened this like a
rabid animal I don't know why I did that
oh my gosh this is the original Kim and
Kanye vogue cover which if you guys have
been watching my videos for a while you
guys know I just love them and this
photoshoot was literally one of my
favorite things in the world so this is
the fancy all wrapped up brand-new
version and I got it for like $23 I
think so super cool collectible item for
cheap in fact I'm pretty sure that's
what I got in this package too so let's
see this is the Kim Forbes cover I got
what is this oh my god wait what oh my
god you guys I'm literally dying I
ordered that magazine from a Rando off
eBay and look at this
thank you for your I love your YouTube
babes this is hilarious thank you wow
that is so funny everybody's so small
but anyways thanks the haul I love it
it's gonna sit on my coffee table next
to the road one and both of these are
joining my cam paper magazines oh I'm
gonna keep these all right there Oh with
the random pumpkin in the back but
anyways alright what else did we get oh
yes shoes ye oh my god I literally so
excited to show you guys these okay so
I've left designer shoes my whole life
but I just never felt comfortable
especially not much money on a shoe
because like what are you serious
I know I know my singing boy sucks but
bees don't suck they're beautiful
these are my new shoes brand new Manolo
Blahniks in the box I make something
guess they're not technically brand new
though they've been worn like one time
but you can see fully authentic so
stinkin cute oh my god
I am literally obsessed with these as
you can tell by my screeching um but
these are like $2,000 boots but on eBay
the starting bid was $70 $70 granted I
didn't get them for $70 I ended up
getting them for like 130 I think but
either way I'm freakin steel I'm never
buying designer shoes at full price
again Oh to go with the mystical shoes I
got ah some fuzz I'm not really but you
guys are always asking me about the
white fuzzy jacket that I wear and
literally all of my lip books it's
literally the best I'm obsessed with it
where all the time I actually got it on
the side of the road in London for like
$20 if you missed that video here it is
so that was when I picked up that fuzzy
baby I searched it searched high and low
to find a duplicate and lo and behold
they're on eBay so I'll admit it looks
very crazy with my current outfit of the
day but oh my goodness I finally found
one for you guys and look at this this
one's even cooler because it has like
tufted layers of fuzz so very luxurious
looking PSU guys this is of course fake
fur I've been a vegetarian for like
seven years but we got some pho for the
reaction going on instead so super fun
great way to steal the look for half the
price and without hurting our fuzzy
friends it's such a look maybe I'll just
leave this on to rice to the video no
but maybe just for this next product
okay so next we have diamonds except not
real diamonds they're definitely fake
but you're there anyway
I love rings I'm wearing literally all
the time so I thought it would be cool
to have some costume jewelry so I bought
this one online and in theory it would
be really beautiful but it actually
ended up being like a piece of cheap
plastic so I was very salty about that
like you can see one of my nice rings
next to the cheap plastic one they're
just not the same at all so big buzzkill
but you know still kind of fun to wear
to the bars at night in the dark and
tell people you're engaged to a
billionaire alrighty what else do we got
here Oh actually how about this little
cutie
storytime behind this ever since my
vintage shopping hall I've been obsessed
with vintage things I just think they're
the coolest so I thought it'd be fun to
get a little bottle of vintage perfume
this one's actually from like the 50s I
think and still full of the original
perfume thought it'd be just such a cute
little decoration but uh you can also
see in reference to my hand
it's literally this big so cute but um
literally looks like a Honey I Shrunk
the kids kind of thing can I make a
reference to that does anyone know what
I'm talking about I swear I'd turn 24
and it's like I suddenly got old and
crusty but anyways yeah
super cute but next time I think I'll
read the dimensions on things before I
buy them alrighty let's see what else
speaking of Chanel we've got so Chanel
friends except of course it's not really
Chanel because it was $26 but I'm gonna
show it to you anyway
I just love celebrity style dupes so
this is just a really nice little black
tweed jacket you can see it's got
pockets and everything cute detailing so
here's the fashion show so cute
everything looks friggin weird with what
I'm actually wearing so hang on let me
change my quick there we go much better
but you can see it's super cute little
tweed should now inspire jackets very
regal and classy probably a lot more
classy if you weren't wearing like a
sparing booty shorts but you know hey
fashion is fashion by the way both this
jacket and the fuzzy black one are brand
new with tags actually had no idea but
there's actually like a whole section of
ebay that's basically like Amazon do you
guys hear that
why is my house so loud anyways like I
was saying there's actually a whole
section of eBay that's just like Amazon
that has like brand-new with tags
boutique II kind of stuff so super cool
I had no idea so I'll do like a full
cheap eBay clothing haul soon but
anyways for now next product concert
merch Kanye canceled this tour before I
got to go to it but you can see I still
got the official concert rich online so
cool they have merch from like every
concert ever basically so go ahead get
to click in you can find whatever you
want really the only thing you got to
watch out for is there's a lot of fake
March out there and since I'm not
allowed to endorse fake products make
sure you buy the real ones and last but
not least I actually already showed you
guys these but that all the celebs are
wearing I just realized that really
should have called this video like
buying a bunch of Kim Kardashian
inspired things on eBay but you know
whatever so like I said if you click
around on eBay right now you'll see
these shoes are literally selling for
like seventeen hundred bucks but for
some reason some girl will be ok I was
selling um for three hundred bucks so I
bought them it's important to treat
yourself every once in a while even if
it is for a bunch of like really random
weird stuff so anyways there you have
you guys that is my little eBay shopping
haul I hope you guys enjoyed the video
because honestly one of the reasons I
started my youtube channel was like I
would always text my mom and my friends
like pictures of things that I bought
and literally no one cared so you guys
adults the love of stuff with me so
