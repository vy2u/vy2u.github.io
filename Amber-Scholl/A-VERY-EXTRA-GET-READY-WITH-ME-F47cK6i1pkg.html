never do videos like this this is so
strange where I was where is anything oh
hi guys what's up it's amber welcome
back to my channel so today in case
you've never seen my videos before this
is very weird I usually am like cake to
makeup because that is much thing but
today I've got nothing on we are
starting with a bare face because I have
never done a get ready with me video and
you guys are always asking me to do one
so I figured you know what why not
the only thing is I'm not a famous
makeup artist nor do I know how to do
makeup at all or hair or anything but I
figured it would still be fun to show
you guys my little get ready routine
sort of thing plus I was just in a
really extra mood this morning but um I
mean what am I not so I figured what
better day to film them today
you know seize the moment live in the
present do what you want to do this
isn't going to be an inspirational video
but I guess maybe I don't know anyways
I'm distracted as always so let's just
get to the video a very chitchat e
unprofessional get ready with me and
since it wouldn't be my video without
extra in the title without further ado a
very extra
all righty so today the bane of my
existence we have to use a tripod a I
literally like hate tripods and I never
use them but for the purposes of this
video I have to because I really don't
know how to like show my makeup if I'm
not using one that's like really hard so
here we go I'm using a tripod today so
first things first I put on my primer I
don't even know like mm-hmm
so anyways like I said I just really
wanted to talk to you guys a lot about
some stuff I literally always do my
makeup the same I feel so boring like
even just doing this but it's like
lalala yep just putting this all over my
face wrong because I don't know what to
do lalala oh yes amazing alright so um
let's see what's been going on in my
life lately I feel like I have a lot of
stories to tell you guys but I can't
even think of them right now of course
because I'm filming this so hmm I know
we're going to put this weird little
head thing on just because my makeups
getting all in my hair and I don't know
how to fix that it's like always getting
all grey and you guys are always asking
if I'm going grey no I'm not going grey
I just like can't seem to figure out how
to get foundation not in my hair so
anyway it's like I said not a
professional so I really don't want this
video to be a tutorial because like I
said that's so boring I don't know what
I'm doing but random side notes I did
listen to all of your comments and you
guys were complaining about how shiny I
was so I went ahead and bought concealer
and bought baking powder stuff so I'm
gonna try and bake my face today ooh
all right great oh look got my good old
trusty filthy contour kit another side
note I really don't know how like beauty
gurus keep all their makeup so clean all
the time because my makeup is just a
mess like consistently constantly a
frickin disaster my mom calls me dirty
Dan and now I'm done no I'm kidding but
um breo's my blending brush oh my gosh
so I know I don't know if you guys can
hear this but the noise outside it's so
loud huh anyways I found it so we're
just going to blend that in mm-hm
well I said I really didn't want it to
turn into a tutorial and Here I am
turning it into like a really bad
tutorial so one of those people usually
talk about and get ready with means um
what do I talk about I'm going to tweet
you guys really quick because I really
don't know what to talk about in this
video so what you guys want me to talk
about will just keep blending my face
and doing this at the same time
I don't know multitasking whatever so
wait for you guys to answer me put on
some powder while we wait Allah Allah
powdered up plus the fancy white powder
mmm yeah here we go mmm mm-hmm
am i doing this this is not correct but
whatever by the way people always drag
me for the way I hold my brushes this is
how I've always held them I know it's
really weird I never knew it was weird
until I posted these videos and people
commented on it but yeah I don't know
this is just how I hold the brush is how
I hold my pencil how I do everything
who knew like I said we're gonna try
that baking thing where you put the
powder under your eye so here we go oh
it actually does look way less shiny
whoa I'm still probably doing this wrong
but looks like it helped a little whoo
I'm just gonna put this everywhere now
I'm shook this is working Wow
maybe I am a beauty guru after all and
some more bronzer to my face while I
answer the questions so what do you guys
wanted to hmm let songs to get ready to
well
I love getting ready to Bob's that's
just one of my favorites all right we're
just gonna add some highlights my
favorite part any look one of you guys
asked what my dating life was like let
me tell you I actually went on the worst
date of my entire life like three nights
ago so if you guys want to hear that
story um I will tell that maybe in my
next video I'll see amp dating I've been
so into The Bachelor at this season I
love Metro it is my favorite show ever
I'm so excited to see who she picks
actually auditioned to be on The
Bachelor last year for Knicks season and
I didn't get it which was such a bummer
because I used to like to be obsessed
with him but yeah that was a weird
experience to another Future story time
anyway it's back to Highline winos
highlight your nose great put a little
dollop there they're fabulous shiny but
anybody oh look duck low my favorite
part of any get ready already smell of
my face of my face and then we're
actually going to take a break and do my
hair because I kind of like to like base
the rest of my makeup around what my
hair looks like so so when it comes to
my hair I talked about this before I
wear extensions this is kind of
extensions that I use I have a whole
video on them but as you can see it's
literally just like one big piece but
you kind of slip onto your head and once
it's flipped on you just kind of pull
your hair through and butterbean
Mattapan tada
you've got fabulous hair I like I said I
usually wear my hair straight but I
really wanted to try a look kind of
similar to this one I don't know like
that I was in a mood so I figured we'd
try something new because look what I
just got in the mail ooh a company
called foxy Bay just sent this to me and
I'm so excited to open it let's see wow
I'm living so basically I think I'm
never gonna have to buy a curling iron
literally ever again because they're
like how many one two three four five
six seven seven one and one so um I
guess we're going to try this one I
don't know
great alrighty so we're just going to
turn this bad boy on no you can see it
has like a little temperature control
thing so I'm going to set mine to be
high just because my hair is thick so I
want it to be like you know really get
through my whole hair so we're going to
go ahead and set mine to 350 and oh it's
already heated up well that was fast
okay so here we go I'm just going to
take like thin little sections and just
wrap it around the hair glue oh oh God
be careful don't sneeze when you have
hot things in your face
all righty so just hold it on there I
don't know how long I did that for like
20 seconds whoa
I got myself a curl since I want to bore
you guys I'm just gonna go ahead and do
that too literally my whole head so hang
on I random side note I'm like so hungry
right now I am starving to death so I
don't know what food I'm going to get
for lunch when you guys ask me what I
eat in the day honestly I don't know I'm
probably going to get Froyo I have no
idea what I want I really don't have a
very balanced diet it's like a bunch of
sugar and a bunch of trash food because
of my favorite so there we go you can
see I curled this half of my hair and
now I'm just gonna go ahead to the other
side
so not really sure if I nailed the Kylie
look at all but this is cool it's just
like Victoria's Secret bombshell pageant
hair I'm loving it
so major shout out to foxy Bay for
partnering with me on this video by the
way if you guys want to twin with me if
they agree to give you guys 60% off on
the whole site so code folks the Ember
you're welcome put my bow back in my
hair okay so now that we got my hair all
done we're going to go ahead and I'm
guess I'm going to finish my eye makeup
because it needs some minor glitter I
don't know maybe we'll do like a gold or
something all right so while I do this
I'm also going to answer a couple more
questions
it's Lloyd your YouTube crush um I don't
know is it weird to say a girl
Tammy hem brow and her family are the
cutest people in the world as she's
Australian and I love to practice my
Australian accent it has like a super
hot boyfriend and two cute little kids
so I love to watch their vlogs you know
to keep my Australian accent on point
once link is that good hello most I'm
really trying to practice to make it
fabulous or when I go to Australia
someday you guys will be super impressed
with me by the way you probably noticed
yes I have my eyelash extensions in
today which is why my eyes don't look
super bare so just in case you were
wondering I have a video on those too
but just going to go ahead Ark and mess
up small Emma can't even see that but
whatever you can imagine it so - oh
there we go and just because like I said
I'm in kind of a glam mood today and
this is actually like a little sparkly
eyeshadow that I love from Jeolla mmm
just like a super potent little like
sparkly palette I love I'm just going to
put a little bit of that on my eye
because you know extra look is complete
without heavy liner even if it's the
daytime so I'm going to go ahead and
line my eyes like I always do so I guess
I'm super aggressive liner I don't know
why nuts with the highlight poppin now
we've got to get my eyebrows because
they look stinking crazy so we will work
on those next so I know that honest
costea bro thing just like everybody
else so you're just going to put that on
my eyebrows um there we go lalala
fantastic one of you guys just asked if
I would ever go blonde like my sister um
no I don't think so I love my dark hair
um so maybe it would be fun to have a
blonde wig for like a day but I think
I'll just like stick to my brunette
roots
I don't oh my god someone just asked
what my favorite pun is if that is not
the best question I've ever heard um hmm
let me think about this while I do an
eyebrow alright we're going to gel these
babies up but I think my favorite kind
of puns are the ones where I don't
notice I'm doing them like in my bra
video when I said well this is a bus and
didn't notice like bust bra ha ha ha my
dad would be so proud that his stupid
dad jokes have rubbed off on me alright
so now that the brows are done on a
normal everyday basis I wouldn't do this
but like I said I'm in a mood today so
over my eyelash extension I'm going to
put on some falsies you guys always aqua
brands I use these are brand called
black magic lashes but they're now
called bruised and Rouge so I'll link to
them below this is the style cosmic
kitten so I'm just going to go ahead and
glue those on on top of my lash
extensions like so so you can see that
right there
whoo baby Killa since my eye makeup the
way so intense I always like to do a
plain nude lip so use my signature and
my xsplit liner involve crippled out all
over already there we go like I said
what fabulous setting spray just like
always
hmm so now that my makeup is all done
and my hair is all curled and fabulous
we're going to go ahead and pick out a
very extra outfit I'm not really sure
what I'm in the mood to wear today but
we'll see all righty so my closet is
literally a mess in here I do not know
what I want to wear hmm hmm maybe too
much too little not quite there we go
always a good option but you know what's
funny I think my favorite thing is
actually what I was filming in which is
so understated I like didn't want to
wear it for this but you know what
whatever understated can be cute too so
we got this little black dress
super cute and definitely still extra
especially when you pop the red low
actually have this tied around my head
but hey it looks great on my neck to
come back to look what's the little
black book and voila it may not be as
extra as the other outfits but you know
considering the fact that I'm literally
going nowhere I would say this is extra
enough Simon I'm really surprised my
curls held for like 17 outfit changes so
I'm officially impressed Oh baby left so
there you have it you guys
that is my very extra ready with me
thank you so much for watching
um as always like I said I'm not a
professional but I really appreciate
that you guys care to watch my funny
life and watch me struggle to do things
and tutorials because well you don't
have to watch me so thank you for taking
time out of your day to share your
license it truly means the world by the
way everything that I used in this video

foxy Baker Lee iron are all linked below
so if you want to twin with me those are
all linked there um don't forget to
subscribe to the channel for all sorts
of other fun nonsense by the way one
more question before I sign off I would
just like to answer this one amber how
do you stay feeling like a queen all the
time and the answer is actually I
learned this off of tumblr this is
actually one of my favorite pieces of
advice ever in the whole world ever the
post was said one day I looked in the
mirror and decided I was a queen and I
was and that honestly that post changed
my life and it's so true you eyes
literally the more you tell yourself
you're fabulous the more one day you're
going to believe it so don't forget that
you guys throw on your crowns ladies you
don't need me to tell you how to be a
queen the key to being a queen is
already inside you so there's a little
bit of a more inspirational nonsense for
the day and that my friends will be able
for today I love you guys stay extra my
angels XO
