matcha green tea latte and I'm basically
just living hashtag my best life ever
hey guys what's up it's amber welcome
back to my channel and to be honest I
guess it would be funnier if I was
kidding but I actually did just get this
and I did just drink all of it in my car
so what's up welcome back to my channel
and happy best Sunday ever or I guess
rather it's not Sunday because that's
not what I'm uploading this but and when
I'm filming this so whatever so today I
thought it'd be fun to continue my very
extra love book series with a look book
based on glasses because I get a lot of
questions from you guys who wear glasses
on how to style them and look cute and
fabulous not to mention their tres
trendy right now so gear up guys get
ready we are apparently wearing our
braids of necklaces and we are doing a
very extra glass this lookbook here we
go
Oh
so forth look look I'm going ahead and
teaming up with your wonderful glasses
usa.com which has also kindly agreed to
send me all the glasses for today's look
book they've got literally thousands of
styles of glasses at all the different
price points all from the comfort of
your own home and all for like 70
percent off so it's win-win for all of
us all right here we are first look
23 year old tumbler schoolgirls so as
you can see for this lookbook we are
clearly going the full tumbler monty so
I'm going to kind of like a schoolgirl
look and look the glasses really
inspired me bitter and the super cool
oversized tortoise look in one you can
see it looks adorable on my face
definitely got an oversized tumbler vibe
Stefon shorts are super tumbler II so I
went ahead and threw those are new to
the ones I got in New York actually in
my little New York shopping blog so if
you want to look at that
throw in a backpack a plain little white
cropped tee dirty white sneakers some
braids in my hair to really channel the
faux look throw in some really cool
necklaces just because I feel like that
I don't know has to be aesthetic I need
to see without the glasses it looks cute
but like the glass is just really really
make it look fabulous I actually don't
need glasses by the way but they do
found non prescription ones too as well
as prescription ones so that is some
good glass of news what a handy braid
this is it works well as a teacher
pointer well well well if miss Blair
Waldorf isn't finally ready for class so
this is look number two as you can see
it totally inspired by these adorable
little black frames I call these my sexy
secretary teacher glasses I read
literally all the time in videos
whenever I'm like quote teaching
something like how to walk in heels or
whatever other class I might be teaching
that day so we'll look at very Blair
Waldorf's asked I just got like a black
little schoolgirl skirts and thigh high
tights can join two little slippery
sandal heel things of course the whole
look is inspired by the black frame if
you want a good laugh this is actually
just a bathrobe tie I flipped around my
neck so there you go again you can see
the full look super cute very Blair
Waldorf's and very classy chic nananana
I literally look like a space alien okay
so let's look is completely centered
around these cool clear frames which I
am just
obsessed with you can see they're
totally transparent frames transparent
lenses you can see they make your eyes
look really big and they just give off a
really cool vibe so this outfit is
literally just a black choker a gray
kind of matching set very casual and
actually what my bra peek out a little
bit at the bottom because I thought it
just I don't know looks kind of cool I
went ahead and threw my hair into those
like varied spice girl hair bun still on
that same backpack for the look I just
wanted to be fun to have CyHi fishnets
on very kind of like too cool for school
kind of vibes but let me tell you kids
and they're too cool for school
especially glasses you look extra smart
and already so this book is inspired by
Miss Kendall Jenner's so all I've done
here is centered around these black
glasses you can see super cute fit a
pretty basic oversized black frame I
just really like the way these looked on
my face with the thin frames but also
like I said they're oversized so they
really add a cool look to your eyes and
overall I went headed through my hair up
in a little messy bun to add to the kind
of lazy look literally any graphic tee
would look great with some ripped jeans
match it with some killer lace-up
booties and then of course the glasses
just really add and we get such an extra
cute look OOP these red lipstick I love
it mwah
and it wouldn't be it look book without
some flannel so here we go this whole
look is kind of inspired by these white
glasses which I am a literally
assessment I love the colored frame or I
guess I know lack of colored frames so
these are just white little framed
glasses you can see they're kind of
square shaped but not really they also
go with anything because they're white
and are just really fun and have a young
trendy vibe to them so of course I'm
totally into it all right so what we got
here is a white tube top paired with
some white booty short looking things
then I went ahead and wrapped a flannel
around my waist of course you don't have
to wear it on your waist you can totally
wear it on yourself too if that's so
floats your fancy prepared the bottom
aesthetic with some really cool boom
Lala throw on a little white choker to
match the white glasses definitely a
really laid-back kind of beachy vibe I
don't know just a super cute kind of
love already so this look is very
glamorous Queens so this look was
inspired by these very sexy cat eye
looking glasses I love them you can see
their black frames
kind of winged out at the edges a little
bit to put my eyeliner certainly have a
retro vibe to them I actually picked
these out after trying them on in the
virtual mirror super cool tools you can
try on all the glasses before you pick
them out I got to give off a very sexy
Catwoman vibe so I decided to dress in
all faux fur like a sexy cat so this
look is actually just a satiny crop top
with some cool satiny bottom this is a
fabulous faux fur vest I think I got
this from China for like $11 for my hair
in a long braid for this look and again
some killer heels look at these wow so
pretty the whole look is just perfectly
glasses fabulous which I know is not a
word but today so there you have it you
