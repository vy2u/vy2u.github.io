to be like New York Fifth Avenue
inspired but I really kind of look like
I'm going to Paris or something
hello I've read it - welcome to the
restaurant No okay anyways what is up
you guys it's ever welcome back to my
channel and today I just thought it
would be fun to do a very extra wintery
lookbook because well it's January and
even though I live in LA and it's not
very wintry here I know a bunch of you
guys have been requesting some winter
fashion in spa so I thought I would go
ahead and film a bit for you today for
the first time in my new pad I'm gonna
do a little fashion show lookbook for
you to inspire the inner polar bear in
all of us so without further ado here we
go
a very extra winter
xoxo Gossip this first outfit it's
definitely Blair Waldorf inspired taking
a cue from good ol Gossip Girl we've got
a black caught me turtleneck here super
cute very cheap too is like 20 bucks
then of course we've got this super cute
skirt you're probably recognized for my
Instagram schoolgirl skirt Amazon $20
tights are a super fun way to make
anything wintry and sexy you can see you
know I got a run in them already because
oops what can you do nothing's perfect
as for shoes off we've got these killer
little lace-up booties so stinking cute
11 we've got this little Parisian
inspired hat I don't know I just thought
it was kind of fun so there we go
definitely not for like harsh winters or
anything but for the Le winters where I
live it's perfect
okay next book Oh welcome to Virgin
Atlantic your flight is this way as you
can see we're offering peanuts and
that's it that's all we've got
okay so this look at the little flight
attendant inspired and that wasn't on
purpose but you know we're busting back
up the black tights because they are
just so fun as you can see they look
killer with these shoes which I guess
we'll start with the shoes because this
outfit is all about the shoes when
Valentino dupes 50 bucks I'm gonna head
in paired the shoes with a black
turtleneck dress which the scarf is kind
of getting in the way of but you can see
super cute just a little black
turtleneck dress take the scarf off for
a second so you can see you do a little
black turtleneck dress very fun we got
it online for a couple of bucks to spice
it up and a scarf starts are super cute
with your accessories
this one is i'ma think Louie Vuitton
when I got on eBay
Don't Tell then of course threw on the
little Parisian ratatouille hats and the
voila flight attendant chic oh la why am
i walking like this I don't know but oh
wow so this look is actually just a cowl
neck sweater and I went ahead and glued
some fuzz on the arms paired it with my
fake fuzzy bunny huh
some white jeans just to add contrast in
between the black thigh-high peep toe
boots oh my goodness
killer killer so this one is a little
bit more of a casual or what
more casual look than the rest but
definitely still extra and definitely
still with tree fun I also look a little
bit like I'm going horseback riding but
you know cute horseback riding oh my
goodness this is just such a cute little
okay oh this look consists of a white
fuzzy hat that I just thought was super
cute you can see up close
scattered little white girls on it and a
faux fur puff so I just thought that was
you know super fun with its matching
sweater I got them both at Target for
like 15 bucks I believe then went ahead
and to make it a little bit more glam
snow inspired tweed little skirt I got
on Aliexpress you guys might recognize
it from my insta prepared to loop with
some white boots off yes mama
patent leather booties ah doesn't get
much better than this so you can see the
full look all together oh my goodness
it's like a little elf alrighty we're
going a little bit more casual with this
one today but you guys know casual is it
really in my vocabulary so here's what
we've got for a casual this is just like
a little white thin sweater I got this
on wish for like three dollars if you
guys remember it from my haul but uh
definitely would recommend getting it on
Amazon for just a couple bucks more
it'll come in a day and be just as nice
fit with some baggy boyfriend jeans I'm
obsessed with these jeans they're so
cute these are actually the ones with
the holes in the bud so maybe you know
for winter not the best idea so get some
that are like you know not wholly in the
butt great it with some cute ankle
booties to glam it up but you can see it
also looks just as cute with some
sneakers it's just a little bit more
cash there we go
my version of casual woo winter okay
alrighty what is going on here nobody
knows but allow me to explain ooh
coming in clutch with the 90s schoolgirl
vibes again part in the ladder I'm just
doing a little construction work here so
anyway I was born in 93 so this is like
the highlight of my life that all these
cool fashions are coming back in style
so here we go so this is a very school
girls 90s kind of buy but we've got a
white turtleneck which I actually just
put a black dress over so you can think
it kind of creates that little vintage
vibe then of course that
with the black tights because well this
whole lookbook wasn't really supposed to
be a little book about tights but I just
love tight so tights back in action with
some quarter leg trouser socks and some
super cute little oxford pumps I've been
obsessed with Oxford pumps ever since I
just decided I liked them in case you
get chilly I got this black fringy coat
oh my goodness how fun is this I love it
really kind of a random vibe but I love
it oh I'm like a genie no no no no okay
so this is my next look this is a little
bit dumb I don't really know what this
is you can see this is just a white
turtleneck bodysuit so cute then I
paired it with these fabulous with
shining rose gold pants oh these are
just so cute and look at the aesthetic
with my nails ooh fire as for shoes
we've got some wild shoes going on here
today
I just thought these were hilarious
they're dupes of really expensive
Guiseppe Zanotti is so I could maybe see
what I mean faux fur winter you know
makes sense kinda not really what I care
that's a cool look so there we go that
is our princess jasmine if she were a
wintry insta ho look oh okay oh yes just
swimming up some faux fur realness oh
that definitely just sounded like go for
it but it wasn't you guys it was just my
boots see if it was a part I would have
lied it's edited it out anyways but so
okay here we go
next look some of this we have a white
turtleneck again paired with some
fabulous faux fur I actually got this at
I think forever 21 years and years ago
it's such a cute like pattern the Browns
are just a really nice neutral so there
we go we've got that paired with some
killer bootylicious white jeans then
magical farting whoops
nude patent leather I just thought this
was like such a big mood and I'd rarely
get to wear them so I'm taking this over
to
to fillet so there you go this look is
actually pretty simple but still very
cute too to be a smash hit yes looking
like a million fake dollars hmm whoa all
right so I'll be the first to admit this
is not exactly like super wintery but
like I said it's about 75 degrees in LA
still so this is my version of winter so
this look was inspired by all the
celebrity denim crazies lately oh my
goodness denim is so hot right now we've
got my DIY glittery jeans here oh so
cute brought back those white boots from
earlier but this time click the jeans
over them for a kind of a different
effect and off-the-shoulder kind of
boyfriend denim top matched it all
together for a very weird look but there
are no rules in fashion when you're just
standing around your house for our
YouTube videos so honestly I love it no
no no no no no no no I'm gonna fall over
okay and for the grand finale
this is a red fuzzy faux fur cut I love
it love it love it
then we just paired it with some generic
black leggings those boots from before
and of course the best red jacket I ever
did see but step back from earlier to
some cardi B level bling oh baby
speaking of jewelry my necklaces just
restocked in gold and limited edition
silver so if you want to add one of
those the link is in the description I
see you guys wear these just makes my
heart swell so big and Christmas season
