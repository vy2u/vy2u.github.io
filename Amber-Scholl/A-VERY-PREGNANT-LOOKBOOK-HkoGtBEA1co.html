you so last night I went to the Harry
Styles concert it was amazing it was the
best night of my life and after his
performance we had a wild romantic
rendezvous and now I am totally kidding
that obviously doesn't even make any
sense how would I be nine months
pregnant from yesterday like I'm not
good at math but still I know that makes
no sense so I may not be pregnant in
real life but today I am I'm going to be
playing mama because a lot of you hot
mamas out there have been DMing me and
requesting a pregnancy style lookbook so
I thought why not that will be fun show
you guys how to slay the game when
you're dressing for two so without
further ado here we go
a very pregnant oh my gosh this is so
weird a very pregnant hot mama look
boom baby I actually always start my
look books out by saying that so this is
just like very punny and funny that it
really is a baby this time so anyways
here we go
first look alrighty so we're gonna start
this lookbook out with what I was
wearing it in the intro this is just a
really cute little halter dress from
forever 21 it was like $12 and super
super stretchy which is why it goes
right over zip bump
I went ahead and paired it with a very
cute little white crappie jean jacket
because honestly even if I wasn't fake
pregnant I would totally wear this
together and these are just my newest
favorite heels ATM at the moment I just
thought they were super fun so you know
what why not here we go you can also
wear it without the jacket too and that
really shows off the bump this is really
so trippy it's like looks so real so
there you go you can see the full look
adorable oh highlight honestly goo y'all
see in that Wow I tried to fenty
highlighter and it is fat so I'll link
that below but anyway it's so boom next
look alright though this is our next
look which really makes it look like I'm
carrying a giant egg in my stomach or a
pumpkin because you know it's fall you
got to stay festive pumpkin spice baby
no I'm kidding okay anyways so when I
was out shopping for this lookbook I
realised rap tops always look fab on
cute little pregnant mamas because they
really accentuate the look while also
keeping it classy and fun this is
actually a nude little mini dress that I
over it I tied this little white top so
super fun little cute look ninh or not
you couldn't keep me out of high heels
so I've got my little balm on do booties
to mesh and voila it's just a super cute
little I don't know going to lunch look
this is really freaking me out it looks
so real okay anyways alrighty so this
next look is very casual hot mama goes
to the park to the movies to Trader
Joe's I don't know where ever hot mamas
go so I actually asked quite a few
people before I did this look book what
it was like to be pregnant and what they
like to wear the most and many of them
said leggings cuz they're cute comfy
stretchy and always fit we got some nice
soft cotton leggings from forever 21
just go ahead to size up so then
obviously you know they can stretch
around the belly by matching plain white
tank top this is from H&amp;amp;M I believe the
leggings are from forever
21 to 99 so you can get a million-in-one
pairs you got your baby daddy's jacket
going on it's very boyfriend II kind of
style with them the kind of sweatshirt
underneath super cute this was from also
from forever 21 for like 30 bucks I love
it busted out the sneakers because of
course I know when you're preggo you
don't always want to be in heels so
we've got some comfy shoes to walk the
dog walk the baby walk yourself and
voila that is this soft little cash hot
mommy look whoo
damn this is like the most pregnant
human being alive oh my god this is
freaking me out it looks so real by the
way I just realized I don't think I ever
even addressed it the pregnant belly is
literally just a strap one thing I found
from Amazon so there's that see so weird
it looks like a literal egg but anyways
boo-boo but it and that's what makes you
beautiful no no no no no no no no no no
no alrighty this look is going to be
called white hot mama so this look is
actually compiled of a plane stretchy
white bodycon dress
so cute very form-fitting around your
bump a nice little angelic um I don't
even know what you would call this
cardigan kind of thing Plus this was
like $12 so very cheap very cute
definitely wearable post-pregnancy as
well some fabulous shoes even with the
little butterfly wings oh my gosh you
can see how cute those are love it love
it love it what Adam throwing some
diamonds for this look because those
always fit no matter how many months
along you are and there you have it that
is this look push alrighty so this next
look is very kind of holiday chic I'm
ready for the company business party or
I don't know maybe like Thanksgiving
dinner
this is actually a very accurate
representation of what I look like
leaving Thanksgiving dinner but anyways
so here we go
this look is just a super cute little
off the shoulder kind of caught me dress
from forever 21 perfect for fall and
perfect for baby bumps because it's very
stretchy and it's really nice and long
so it will go ahead and cover most of
your legs except the calves which are
extra on fleek today and some very cute
little pumps look at that I just think
these shoes are so cute they have like
little embellished design
I'm definitely a very cute little fall
pregnant mommy look
yep just finished eating all seven
pumpkin pies yes Chuck it's true the
baby is yours so this look is very much
what I would imagine
Blair Waldorf would wear if she was a
mom it to be so what we got here is a
super cute little flare II um I don't
even know but it's just like very fun
like kind of Leonardo da Vinci looking
kind of shirt I'm not sure covered with
a little stretchy sweater dress stretchy
and fun and also very fashionable like
you can't even tell him pregnant from
the front goals prepared to look with
those little black but is that I love so
much and there you go you and your baby
bump are ready to take on the Upper East
Side this is such a look ooh I love it
whoo all righty back to cash you guys um
I was actually wearing this literally
this morning before I started filming
this lookbook because I love this outfit
it's great to pregnant or not so this is
one of my favorite little cozy outfits
um you can see I wear it a lot there's
actually some stains on the top but just
you know ignore that for now um super
cute little stretchy sweater what a
weird angle but um yeah it's got some
cute little stretchy shorts too um super
cozy super cabbage
great for running around the house great
for being cozy great for Netflix and
chilling though based on the looks of
this doesn't look like I need to do any
more Netflix and chilling no reason
hedge will have to be boring get some
sparkly flats a fabulous everyday look
for month one month zero and months well
this looks like month twenty five it's
so big but you know month nine will be
scientifically accurate Chanel pregnant
mommy okay so this next look is very
Chanel inspired this is that cute little
tweed thing that I got on Aliexpress for
like 40 bucks but of course I didn't
wear the matching shorts with it because
I just don't think that would have that
was what a fit very did this look is
literally just like a plain black
bodysuit
it's super fun you can get these
anywhere and pretty sure I got this one
at H&amp;amp;M I think maybe but I will check
and link one in the description paired
it with those same black boots because
it makes your legs look long chunky heel
makes it easy to stand in but all you
got to do to make this a totally
different look you switch the jacket
like look at that boom from business to
party all with just the switch of a
jacket and little baby is still safe in
there just covered in some nice fluff
like a mother hen Oh little baby chicken
and last but not least what I'd probably
actually wear if I were pregnant a giant
oversized sweater crystally slippers and
that's it because even after my day with
this fake belly I'm exhausted
honestly this is still a cute look
though Oh fabulous so there's a lot of
you guys that is my take on a pregnant
lookbook definitely not a normal way to
spend your morning so that was kind of
fun like I said I'm not really pregnant
obviously so don't take it too seriously
I don't know the ins and outs of
pregnancy or anything but this video was
really just meant to be fun and
entertaining and help all the Oh hot
mamas to be out there live your best
life while carrying a brand-new life oh
that was a cute little unintentional
sentence there anyways thank you guys so
much for watching as always if you have
any other questions comments concerns
all my socials are at amber Shoals you
can hit me up on there by the way I
think the coolest thing about this
lookbook is not a single thing I wore
was actual maternity clothes it was
literally just all regular clothes that
I bought a size up in or a very stretchy
material so uh yeah that's what I
discovered look if you've been
struggling to find maternity clothes
that's a fun little idea for you as
always thank you guys so much for
watching I love you so so so very much
and if you're one of the hot mom is out
there congratulate your looking for a
cute name for a girl may I suggest amber
good luck with your mom anis I love you
