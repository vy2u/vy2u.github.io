tumblr conspiracy was real but what do
you know stormy that was a curveball
anyways what is up you guys
amber welcome back to my channel and
today in the spirit of the recent baby
fever would be adorable Kylie
pregnancies video I just thought it
would be fun to go ahead and do a
pregnant shopping adventure to see what
it was really like outside of my house
with a baby book by the way if you're
new to my channel I'm not actually
pregnant obviously this is just a little
strap-on belly for the day but you know
for the day we're protected free all so
without further ado here we go a very
pregnant hmm
this looks so weird it's literally
freaking me out a very pregnant shopping
adventure oh my gosh so weird okay I
wanted to do it and do our outfit of the
day which of course totally inspired by
Miss Kylie so we've got um some fun
butterfly jewelry so cute I got these on
eBay for like hella cheap and look at
that so cool okay so then you've got
this stretchy little black dress which
actually is not a maternity dress at all
this is from one of my favorite little
online shops meskhi it's just really
stretchy a super cute dress form of all
those body since I always wear so
there's that up a mood as for shoes OOP
okay
as for shoeless we're keeping it pretty
simple with some black strappy heels but
uh honestly I don't really know how long
I can safely balance of me is what you
know
now we're gonna go ahead and start it
off fabulous Hey onward ah
doo doo doo doo
I didn't even think how am I gonna sit
ok so we're like 2 inches away from the
steering wheel um I definitely don't
think you're supposed to be driving when
you're like 9 months pregnant but uh you
know since this is fake that's fine all
right so I figured we'd try target first
because
I'm so excited super super flex more
should we go first yeah baby
yes I'm pretty sure they have an actual
pregnant person section here so let's
see mmm maybe maybe this is the section
I need to be shopping in boyfriend
section who's your dad baby
if only you could really buy a boyfriend
to the store hmm so many things to try
what will fit me this probably oh okay
so maybe this is actually not the most
flattering thing I've ever seen so
there's gonna be something better than
this I don't think I did this getting
dressed when you're pregnant is hard
this isn't for me but I got the little
shoes I want to cry buys them no but I'm
not gonna buy them but they're so cute
okay I need to get out of here before I
actually buy baby clothes okay so next

most beautiful place in the world Rodeo

pregnant belly or what but I am so much
more tired than I usually am usually
I'll shop for like seven or eight hours
and I still got plenty of energy but
today I was only out for like four hours
and I was like yeah anyway so I don't
have too much of a haul for you guys
because obviously all the clothes I
tried on like I wasn't gonna buy real
pregnant clothes because I don't really
need a so a very short haul but here it
is literally all I got was the honest
Accio Beverly Hills uh what did I get
it's got this little eyebrow brush so
I'm excited to try that and then I
literally bought like hand soap from
Target and napkins and like boring other
things so nobody much I had fun going
out shopping but I gotta say even being
just fake pregnant for the day was very
difficult there's just so many things
you don't think about like spacing and
so weird I couldn't try on any crop tops
and so many people asked to touch the
belly and I was just like uh-huh
