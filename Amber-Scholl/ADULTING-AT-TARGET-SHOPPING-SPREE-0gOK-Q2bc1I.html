you look so pretty
I missed you I thought I would never see
you again okay so I'm just being
dramatic but quick story time um
literally like three days ago I was
walking around my room and there was an
earring on the floor that was sticking
straight up and I stepped on it and it
went like all the way into my foot I
know this is like so graphic and
disgusting but literally like I was so
scarred from it I'm honestly just a big
worrywart and I was like convinced that
I was gonna get tetanus and died but uh
goodness that didn't happen and now I
get to see your beautiful faces again so
um yeah here's my first video back uh
after my near-death experience so
basically today I just have to run a few
quick errands so I figured it would be
fun to go ahead and take you guys along
for my little target run because I need
a bunch of hourly random stuff I'm in
the mood to get out of my house because
my outfit is cute and we're all gonna be
suburban housewives together except not
really because I'm 24 and buying like
popcorn and cheap nail polish but I
don't need some important things like a
vacuum I don't know anyways I'm rambling
again so uh without further ado here we
go a very fabulous target shopping
adventure again sounding dramatic but
you know anything is an adventure
here we go our outfit of the day I don't
know why I'm being is literally so
dramatic today but you know like I said
life is short you might as well so um as
always before we get going me Hera Zara
distinguished outfit of the day we're in
a very pink Barbie Esquivel or mood um
so we've got a little matching like pink
set thing on the little matchy cropped
jacket it's like so fun so that is our
vibe um white sneakers because you know
we're gonna be wandering around I was
too lazy to even put them on properly
but you know whatever so here we go that
is our target shopping vibe of the day
and uh onward ho whoo dramatic mm-hmm
doesn't this just be so excited so I
need like 70,000 things I don't even
remember what they are so thank God I
wrote them down but here we are let's
good to it usually I just like wander
around randomly until I find what I'm
looking for so it's not really conducive
to the budget but it's great for
shopping ready we're gonna grab a cart
because I'm actually like gonna get a
lot of stuff so here we go put my child
in the seat oh yes
safety first all right here we go all
righty so I just realized I really only
need like very boring things so um stay
with me guys hmm where to start
um I think we're gonna go this way
because that's where the beauty stuff is
about my favorite this is a very lovely
looking woman okay so first things first
my hair dryer broke so I gotta get it me
one of those mmm so many to choose from
mmm this is confusing ooh this one's
pretty but honestly this one's the
cheapest so we're gonna go with this one
alrighty so I really need to read I my
hair because it's like turning red so
let's see where is the one that I bought
yes
this is the hair dye that I used by the
way you guys I've been dyeing it myself
at home for years great money saver I
also need some towels so we'll move on
from haircare too
oh my goodness this is a cart stopping
parts $2.99 I'm gonna get 300 hmm
I don't need this but I want this nicely
the bedding and stuff here is the sole
it oh look how cute
sparkle do I buy this I cook all the
rocks
whoo it totally matches my nails what a
beautiful rug to hand aesthetic usually
when I go in these shopping adventure as
I share like tips and stuff but uh
honestly I don't really have any tips I
just really like target alrighty so I've
wanted a speaker for like 500 years so
as a belated birthday gift to myself
and going to get myself a speaker I do
not know which one though I didn't
realize there was gonna be so many ha
okay
so really random guys like secur secur
nation so you got to get that but oh I
could buy a new camera there's literally
no reason at all to do that though but
by the way a bunch few guys always ask I
have a canon g7x it's fantastic so ah
there you go
whew I wish I needed to decorate
something it could be aesthetic of these
lamps wow this looks so soft well whoo
it is so soft literally the only thing I
hate about target is that every time I
come in here I end up with 17,000 things
I don't need oh I just saw as I'm
walking away from my cart oops
go back there oh my gosh I literally
forgot I need a new hamper so badly mine
is disgusting so um this one seems kind
of cool like organized is it for you
something actually you probably thorgan
izing yourself but for 399 I love it oh
my gosh the food is distracting me and
now I'm hungry let's get a snack yeah
it's on sale amazing literally by the
bagful everyone needs to give me a
sponsorship alrighty
the biggest purchase of the day a vacuum
oh there's so many how do adults do this
this is so confusing why are there so
many vacuums to choose from when they
all look the same target the musical
starring me confused vacuum purchasing
hello
tell me about vacuums whoo who is she
all right so this one looks cool um not
really for any other reason the side if
it's on sale and it has this thing I
don't know whatever we're gonna get this
one because I don't want to look at
vacuums anymore you guys didn't get to
see that but that was literally an event
getting that in the cart so onward ho
all right what else what else
I love the cosmetic section Oh
honestly these looks super fun I
definitely don't need what is this for
I don't even know but these look like
fun huh more things I don't need okay
focusing look guys I met someone she
watches my videos so I thought it'd be
fun to put her in there and you work
here that's pretty cool yeah just here
and I saw you I'm like okay well I think
it's her so hi I also need to get some
hairspray so uh when the hairspray I'll
but it's really confusing because
there's too many options and as such an
indecisive person I struggled but um
this one though I think because it's
$2.99 so great by the way no this is not
a hickey on my neck I do not know what
this is I just discovered it it's like
very itchy though I think a bug bit me
but yeah anyways back to the video well
I'm also out of vitamins so I'm going to
get some vitamins is it today just the
most exciting shopping day I've ever
brought you on this is so boring I'm
sorry you guys but to continue the fun
you want to buy toilet paper
wow I've never seen so much toilet paper
in my life um okay so also on sale this
is my favorite anyways so I'm gonna have
so much stuff in my cart who's gonna be
ridiculous look at all the bikes
it literally is such a big head like
nothing fit
also I think this is not backwards but
oh I don't really need a clock this
one's pretty what time is it shopping
time month every time of the day
I'm losing it clearly I've been here for
too long mission accomplished
question of the century where did I park
my car good morning beautiful peanuts
and so it's actually the next day
because and you couldn't tell in the
vlog but it was like 7 o'clock when I
got home and I went to dinner and I got
like super tired and fell asleep at like
9:00 because that's what I do on
Saturday nights I'm like really not a
very exciting person but anyway so are
you ready for my target oh here it is
Oh rady so I really don't have too many
bags because I had a lot of big
purchases sorry my house is a mess
anyways um so this was like such a
random off the topic vlog um ok la la la
la we'll start out with oh look how
exciting I got vitamins yay let's try to
make this a little more exciting a
hamper we caught this haul okay no I'm
kidding let's try something that
actually is exciting ah yeah I got the
booze little thingy I think this is
gonna be super fun I'm excited to test
this out and play some music
oh that like I said I wanted to speaker
for literally forever so I'm so excited
that I finally have one happy 24th
birthday to myself what other exciting
goodies oh yes my hair dye I'll probably
die my hair later tonight um good old
trusty hairspray yes fantastic um oh
this is the lip liner I'm always using
sometimes they have it at Target
sometimes they have it at Ulta sometimes
they have it at CVS I usually just order
it in bulk online because that's like
the easiest cheapest way to get it but
yes this is NYX lip liner involve mmm
I've been wearing it literally everybody
oh so there's that the second random Q&amp;amp;A
of the day that's my lip color now two
more exciting goodies my hair dryer it
was long like $20 so hopefully this is
balm this was the same brand as my last
one so that's probably gonna be great I
got a thousand in one toilet paper rolls
those $2 cows yeah
$2.99 but whatever still it's steel when
I got that popcorn that I love and I
guess there's nothing left in there but
you mom is the last thing that I got so
to be honest I'm just like way too tired
and lazy to like actually vacuum the
house right now so I just go out it'd be
a mess but it was my little adulting a
target shopping hall I literally got the
most boring stuff ever
basically I swear my videos I'll usually
aren't this boring if you're new I'm
sorry that that was the first trip I
don't you don't forget to subscribe to
the channel uh-huh yeah because next
time I promise I'll take us doing
something much more exciting like shoe
shopping
or maybe petting puppies I don't know
anyways as always any questions comments
concerns can all be directed to my
social media ever show it oh the same
everywhere and um that's that for now I
love you guys get this until next time
my beautiful fabulous angels and best of
luck with adulting if you are like me
this is definitely an interesting period
in your life where you're kind of like a
weird in-between of like a real adult
and a fake adult and um yeah I don't
know I feel like maybe buying a vacuum
will help me like really inch over the
inch over the hill there and I thought
adult thing is weird I'm always kidding
about joking about getting older though
like you should never fear getting older
because the best is always yet to come
so on that's happy note I love you
kisses till next time Excel
oh my god what it was like a hundred
sixty degrees earlier the weather in LA
has been crazy but hey at least I get a
free car wash broke Brits took for the
wind not really as effective as a wash
but much cheaper</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
