been getting millions of questions on my
snapchat and Instagram regarding my
recently found obsession with wearing
wigs so today I thought I'd share with
you all my secrets behind my grey blue
and of course my famous pink mane um so
here we go I'm going to show you a
little bit behind the scenes and how to
get that Instagram where you look
without breaking the bank so tips for
buying a wig my personal favorite if you
have dark hair like me get an ombre wig
because it makes it look so ignore me
giving tax it makes it look so much more
natural
so um braids means the top has dark
roots and I'll fade into another color
all of my wigs are ombre because it just
gives it a way more natural effect and
it makes it look like it could actually
be your hair so next thing is you want
to get a lace front wig if it's not a
lace front that's totally fine but those
are my personal preference which just
means it'll come with a piece of lace
coming down and you trim it up to your
natural hair line so it'll blend in
seamlessly um like I said this is a lace
front that's a lace front this was a
lace front um and they're fabulous so
usually the part so this is what my
normal hair looks like on a daily basis
long brown tada this is actually all
extensions too because my hair naturally
is short so here we go let's show you
this just take off my weave on TV
alright
alright so here we go this is what my
natural hair looks like it's pretty long
but it's thin so it's perfect for
wearing wigs um so here we go mrs. all
you have to do to apply your very own
wig step 1 take your hair take one of
these little elastic bands you know the
kind that you lose every two seconds and
just pull your hair until a low pony
doesn't have to be perfect um
but mind you I do like to have my hair
in the middle part when I'm wearing wigs
because it'll stay a little better all
right there we go boom and then you take
what comes in the package these are like
$0.99 when you order a wig these will
come with them it's a wig cap it kind of
looks like a panty ho stretchy or you
know whatever else you think this looks
like um so then you just got to take
your hair you can't fold it up backwards
like this I'm just still kind of you
know stays under the cap because all you
have to do is put this on your head so
here we go this is not super glamorous
looking but indulge me
alright slip it on I'm no expert at this
by the way like I literally started
doing this not that long ago so if Jesus
sorry I live in the middle of the city
and there's a lot of loud noises but um
so make sure all your hair is pretty
much tucked in it pretty damn good um
there pull it out from your ears
anyways I'm sorry um alright leave a
little bit of the baby fuzzies because
that will make it look more natural once
you put the actual wig on so there we go
how's this for a look okay now for the
wig where did I put it
alright so now literally all you have to
do to apply the wig it takes two seconds
people always like how does how do you
do your hair so I'm literally two
minutes you don't even have to do
anything so after you put the wig cap on
grab your wig of choice mine is gonna be
my favorite great one and literally all
you have to do is you can kind of see
the part here in the front like I said
this is a lace front wig so you can
match up the natural part of the wig to
the natural part of your hair which you
can kind of still see a little bit
behind the wig cap and all I have to do
is slip it right on tug at it a little
you should be good to go pull it right
up to the line of your natural hair
which is like why I said to leave some
of the fuzzies out because it makes it
look a little more natural so make sure
you cover the way cap though or you will
look crazy alright and that's literally
all you have to do um aside of of course
brush your hair just like you would your
regular hair you got to stay looking on
fleek and there you go oops sorry I'm
like ruining my whole room alright come
on
as you can see I'm gonna come a little
closer the quality of hair is awesome it
looks just like real hair you can brush
it run your fingers through it curl it
do whatever you want um but it's so
shiny and so nice and it looks amazing
in pictures okay so where to get them I
get my wigs from literally eBay a
company and for a brand called Shawn
taste lace wigs
they're awesome goes all so Chris imma I
believe I'll include links in the
comment section or the video description
so you can click on them and shop around
they have every color every style these
are 24 inches so there the longest kind
that they have because I wanted a style
that matches my own hair completely so
my hair looks literally exactly like
this but it's usually all round so it
makes it seem more natural and fun like
I might have actually dyed it even
though I did as you can see the quality
of hair is fabulous it feels just like
human hair but is a little softer even
in a little shinier probably because
it's synthetic but on the subject of
synthetic if you are going to get
synthetic hair wigs which all of mine
are I would definitely recommend that
because the real human hair ones are
wild accepted like 3 grand and who has
that kind of money please so these were
all fifty bucks each and looked totally
natural totally fabulous um I mean
natural as you can when you're sporting
you know pink and green hair but um
they're great they're heat resistant
make sure you get heat resistant wigs
because that means you can straighten
them
you can curl them you can do whatever
you want to them without them melting
off so you want to look for something
called heat retarded fibers and that is
what these wigs are so I can do whatever
I want to these without them melting
which is bad you over in your
straightener and your curling iron I
know this from experience so make sure
you look for that there you have it um
hope you learned a little something just
holding this someone had like a crazy
person okay
um hope you learned a little something
about wigs to go out and get whatever
color you want shake up your look um red
blonde brunette gray be a sexy grandma
be whoever you want to be um until next
time guys thanks so much for watching
