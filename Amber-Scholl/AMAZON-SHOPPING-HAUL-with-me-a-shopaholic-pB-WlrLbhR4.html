saw some flowers on tumblr the other day
and I just had to get them they were so
beautiful
Oh anyways it's up pretty people it's
amber welcome back to my channel and um
I'm just half ago buying things guess
what we're doing today buying things
we're technically I guess I already
bought things but you know that's a
technicality whatever so believe it or
not even though I'm an online Shopaholic
I've actually never signed up for Amazon
Prime until yesterday so this is my
first official Amazon hauls honestly I
don't even really remember what I got I
have so many boxes you can see I haven't
even opened them yet so I really can't
wait to open these anymore because I
already waited since last night when
they came so without further ado here we
go a very Amazon shopping haul
all righty so like I said I haven't
opened the new packages yet so it's like
Christmas morning here they are um let's
just dig in already so I guess let's
start with this one like us in here Oh
like I said I got so many different
things I don't even know but I guess
we'll start with this let's try it on oh
it's actually super cute I love it it's
just like a little green and crappie
sweatshirt thing actually don't remember
how much this was but I remember it
being a bang or deal so oh love it by
the way you're probably thinking this
video was sponsored by Amazon nope but
it is sponsored by best fiends why I
don't know but here is a quick word from
our sponsor while you're waiting by the
door for your mustache oil to arrive off
Amazon you now have something to do bus
means is a free puzzle adventure game
where you collect and build a team of
fiends to defeat slugs by matching same
colored objects this month best means is
having their biggest holiday update ever
even played a Halloween event to win
massive rewards including a new
character Henry you can play the game
without an internet connection and
download the game for free using my link
below and you'll get five dollars worth
of gold and diamonds for free - yes gold
and diamonds whoa even if someone who
doesn't love games it's actually really
fun and you know I got to support my
shopping addiction somehow sorry guys I
know no one likes ads but uh ooh I gotta
support my shopping addiction somehow
should I just leave this on the rest of
the video no okay anyways stuff
Oh righty what's next woo a box full of
a lot of things I guess this is actually
just a primer I've really been wanting
to try and it kept being out of stock
every time I went to Ulta so I ordered
it on Amazon um it's like some sort of
tinted sunscreen primer I don't really
know but I thought it would be grooving
you know gotta stay wrinkle free with
the sunscreen so that's that um I also
got these these already shaved my face
with I mentioned that I shaved my face
before but yeah I just shaved like the
sideburns off because I don't know who
wants sideburns so this is what I use
for that too and um yeah they're like
adding two dollars so bigger bigger deal
what else did I get
that's what I think it is oh my gosh yay
okay this is next whoo
beautiful
you know you have a shopping problem
when you've literally order something
looks identical to what you were already
wearing but this is beautiful and
slightly different to someone who
collects rings I would know
so yeah that's super pretty I love it
glad my ring has a brother now all right
so onto the next thing
now with aesthetically pleasing fingers
let's see what this is whoo I splurged I
got real diamond earrings totally
kidding no I didn't he's only like 30
bucks um I always wear diamond studs
like you can see oh I don't have any
that are silver yet like these are gold
you can't really tell but they are so I
thought I'd get some silver ones so
pretty nice as far as I'm concerned you
can't tell the difference between real
diamonds and the fake ones so sure
they're real ready what else is in here
oh wow this is so exciting this is
actually totally TMI but uh these are my
favorite kind of underwear um honestly I
was just tired of spending so much money
on them at Victoria's Secret so I
thought I'd try to off-brand so uh yeah
they look pretty good I'd say uh that's
a win I am NOT gonna try these on for
you because well we're gonna keep this
hall PG so anyways put those over there
now what okay so this I don't even
really know what this is but we're gonna
try this on camera live in action right
now so if this is the first video of me
you've seen you probably don't know this
though you probably could have gathered
it from the amount of jewelry I just
bought in this one video I love sparkly
things but I really like cheap sparkly
things so um a lot of times they like
turn or get dirty so we wanted to get
some kind of jewelry cleaner so I was
googling around for stuff and I found
these um I don't know if these works so
let's try it all righty so here we go to
kind of explain what I'm talking about
you can see my brand-new ring it looks
very clean and nice versus this one you
can see like it has kind of what looks
like dirt on the side of it so um we're
gonna try to clean that puppy with this
guy let's see the reviews on these were
really good so I'm gonna be pissed if
they don't work but uh here we go let's
try it
hmmm honestly still looks a little
tarnished to me but Bill Nye the Science
amber says not great but definitely an
improvement so there we go all right
experiments aside what else do we got
actually I don't feel like going through
the box anymore I actually want to show
you shoes because shoes excite me so
let's do a shoe alrighty so these are
all the shoes that I'm gonna discuss
today and the funny thing about all of
these is two things I suppose
hey they're all designer dupes and me I
ordered them a long time ago but they
are all still available so here they are
all righty so here's the first little
butterfly pair these are so cute and
actually a Duke of the Sophia Webster
heels I love these the original ones are
like six hundred seven hundred dollars
and these I believe are like thirty
bucks so so a steal
these are Valentino dupes oh my god so
stinkin cute the real ones of these run
a cool like 1,500 so uh these that a
cool I think also 35-hour bargain I mean
you really can't tell the difference
between this and the real thing and
these are those just semi dupes I love
these I actually got this particular
pair from a different website randomly
but when I was searching on Amazon for
other shoes to buy I saw them linked
there for cheaper so I thought I would
just share the good news with you now
right go back to this box see what's in
here
what are these so it appears I ordered
two of the exact same jumpsuit I meant
to order different colors but I guess I
did not successfully do that so I guess
we'll try one of them on so you know I
love it um so yeah it's just like a
little black tight jumpsuit thing paired
it with whatever this is that I just
grabbed that in my closet and some you
choose then fantastic I certainly don't
need two of the exact same thing though
so I'll do a Twitter giveaway or
something um here's whatever I decided
to tweet and just respond to that so
I'll pick someone to win this fabulous
alright I also got a cot me gray one
there we go mm-hmm I feel like a gymnast
or something whoa guys want to see a
trick oh there we go
that's my only trick um I used to be a
cheerleader in high school so whoo
that's the only thing that I've retained
anyways next thing
alrighty next boxes what's in here
underwear I got so many packages with oh
what it is the white jumpsuit I tried to
order I guess I just messed up and
ordered two black ones I don't know
whatever anyways ok so I guess I have a
white jumpsuit too
and what's this woo I'm so excited
ok let's see Oh so ever since my friend
Josh did my hair in the celebrity
ponytail whatever I called that video
I've just been wanting to get another
one
so we're gonna try this one whoo this is
actually really nice this is like a
little wrap ponytail thing basically it
like clips onto your hair into a legit
ponytail so let's try it on first we got
to take out my other extensions though
which are my hitting crowns I always
talk about these in my videos I've like
a full video on them but just gonna go
bald for you really quick tada there we
go there's those these are literally the
bomb.com
um anyways so here's my natural hair
we're gonna go ahead and put ponytail in
alrighty so we threw my hair into a
quick ponytail and now what does throw
that guy on oh can you guys see how long
that is in the mirror oh my god it's
like a horse tail
I'd probably straighten it for like
everyday use but blue beautiful it's
thick if I got the hundred percent human
heroine I think this one's like 20
inches I think um so you can like curl
it and do all that stuff too so it's
pretty good
goodbye I'd say Feb alrighty now that
I've made a total mess of my living room
um this is the last box and I have no
idea what I ordered that would have been
this big so hmm oh please oh my god
these wastes so much what I really need
to catch it more but anyways oh I can't
really see them inside the box here but
I got a bunch of new hangers for my
closet with gold hooks instead of silver
ones so like you can see there those
black velvet hangers that I like so much
but they have gold hooks so which is
going to be a very ascetic closet and
one last thing you guys saw me buy a
speaker in my like target shopping video
but I actually ended up not really
loving it so I returned it and actually
upgraded and got this one on Amazon it
is unfeeling
Yubel wow it's just like the slightly
fancier version I think it was like 30
more dollars than the cheap one I got
and I love it it's amazing beautiful and
plays Bangor tunes oh I think I've
officially bought everything Amazon has
offered no believe it or not I actually
bought a couple of other things it
didn't arrive yet
so if you want to see what those are
I'll link those as well but um anyways
for now I think that's it this is so
funny I've changed like 150 times in
this video my hair is different my
outfits different who even won like when
I started filming this two hours ago
anyways thank you guys so much for
watching I love you so so so so so much
I hope you enjoy your amazon shopping
adventures as always if you have any
questions comments concerns oh my social
social so you can hit me up on there and
I will see you guys next time
every time I do these outros lately I
feel like I'm forgetting something but I
guess I'm really technically not so I
guess we'll just do one more quick close
up with my sparkles before we go whoo
beautiful Amazon I love you guys kisses
till next time may angels EXO
oh yes darling I'm ready for our date
