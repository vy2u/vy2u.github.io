my crib I'm totally kidding but that was
literally like my favorite show back in
elementary school middle school anyways
I'm old um so first things first I just
wanted to welcome you because we are
officially doing my bedroom tour finally
so I just refinished or finished
redecorating it so come on inside you're
officially invited inside my bedroom
you
all right here we go you guys so we'll
start outside of my room you guys all
definitely recognize this this is mine
and from a selfie station and vanity
mirror that I built um so is thinking
cute so this is right outside the front
door in my room
we got the whole full length here and of
course the marble floors that I
installed um you can click the links to
my other videos to see how I did all
that if you're interested and by the way
because I know you're gonna ask I
literally got this outfit at forever 21
for like $4 so there's that but now the
really exciting part are you ready
I've never shown this to anyone I mean
except like not on the internet so you
guys are the first to see are you ready
done tada
this is my bedroom you guys so I'm gonna
give you the quick little tour so this
is my little mood board for my room I
googled around 4 hours and finally found
this and this is what I based my entire
room off of so this is what I got out of
that alright so we're gonna start with
my bed because that is hands-down my
favorite part of my room I mean lots of
reasons not literally it's so cute I
just love it
obviously I love the black-and-white
aesthetic as you can see I just think
it's a really pretty classy way to
decorate anything so I have my headboard
which I could just die over even still I
got it like this so long ago and every
day I wake up like my god I love this
headboard it's so pretty you can't
really see because it's hidden behind
all the pillows but the whole thing is
quilted very like chanel ask fancy fancy
and it's like white leather so it's also
pretty low to the ground if you can kind
of see that but then the headboard is
actually pretty tall so it looks great
um I'll set up like this so now let's
talk about book hobos okay so my pillows
are definitely the other favorite part
of my bed um they're just so damn cute
we've got these are actually like
crystallized beaded pillows by Calvin
Klein but guess what they were 20 bucks
from home goods so definitely a steal
compared to the original like $89 a
pillow so is this they just look super
luxe
I love beaded pillows that's a fun way
to like pop your room let's see I've
also got this feathery pillow which I
actually made this
about the base you know what I'm gonna
do it together on this pillow at some
point because it's just awesome I mean
these pillows too but they're so great
they got the little crystals because as
you can tell I love the bling so just
glued some crystals on a regular old
black pillow and bam so that's my little
pillow collection umm just looks great
and adds a lot of luxury as for my
comforter I actually don't have one this
is what's called a duvet it's just like
a big piece of black fabric I got it at
Kohl's actually it's Vera Wang so it's
really pretty and nice um however it
would have probably been way nicer if
I'd actually listened to the directions
and not put just put it in the wash so
you can see it's like got a bunch of
like fuzzies on it now but at the time
when I first got it it was freaking
stunning so I guess probably time for a
new one of those but I didn't want a
thick comforter I just wanted it to kind
of like lay flat on the bed so this is
cool it's basically just like a giant
blanket with some texture to add a
little bit of fun to the bed I think
it's always a fun idea because it would
be just kind of boring without this um
you can see it's like yeah that's cool
but like boom no it's fabulous
um this is just like a white fuzzy
blanket again I got this at HomeGoods
for like $19 so super cute it just adds
a little bit of dimension to the bed too
also uh this mirror $39 from Ikea it is
such a nice mirror to like I'm just
gonna literally stomp all over my nice
pillows but this is like the best part
of my room I think it really adds like a
lot of luxury to it and it was so cheap
you can get these anywhere but yeah by
kilo 139 bucks I don't think you're
gonna find a better deal than that so if
we move across corners here this is my
little I guess you could call this my
little work space station I'm all
oftentime plot my laptop right here and
just sit and edit videos for hours um
but this I've got these are little boxes
um they don't really have any purpose
they're empty but I set them up to look
kind of like books this actually is a
candle holder tada so I'll flick that on
at night because it adds like a nice
little cute um lighting and you can see
it's all diamond D so of course my
favorite and let's see oh by the way
books fabulous way to decorate a room
because who can afford Chanel but
everyone can afford this book even
though it is kind of pricey but it's a
really cool book it makes a great
decoration for um any room I got this
online you can get them at Barnes and no
excuse me that goes at Barnes &amp;amp; Noble
this is like 75 bucks but if you could
have used one they're way cheaper on
Amazon so check that out and let's see
also uh placemats I'm obsessed with
placemats this is literally from Bed
Bath &amp;amp; Beyond um it's just a black like
see-through placemat that I put because
I felt like it would make my desk a
little cooler
um and then I've got one of these now
these actually are straight from home
goods also they're meant for your
bathroom but I always put them on
various like tables and stuff because I
just think they look really pretty so
that's this was a steal - so it's like
nine dollars I think so super cute and
actually my favorite well one of my
favorite parts of my room is this
freakin lamp my god
it literally it's like the most
beautiful lamp in the world so let me
just tell you actually do you guys want
to hear a really boring story about the
lamp well you're gonna hear it anyway
okay so the boring story about the lamp
is like lamps are so expensive I had no
idea I was like am I gonna need to get a
sugar daddy to buy me a lamp what I'm
totally kidding by the way but seriously
they are like hundreds of dollars and I
had no idea um so when I was looking for
a black lamp to put my room I honestly
gave up like I can't afford one I tried
to DIY some lamps and it was like
failing miserably
but I ended up going to a showroom that
had this lamp on the floor and they were
like oh yeah this lamp is discounted
from 500 it is scratched I will give it
to you for 99 if you just take it home
today so I took it home that day but lo
and behold they still to take down my
address and stuff for like billing with
my credit card and like three weeks
later I got a package like a giant ass
box at my front door and I was like what
the heck is this I didn't order anything
and I couldn't figure it out and I
opened the box and they had sent me
another lamp like as a mistake so I
ended up getting a two lamps uh - like
five hundred $85 lamps for 99 dollars
um I never told them that they
accidentally sent me another lamp
because I was like I want this so I
actually put it in my living room
because I figured if I have two lamps
you know
might as well use them so that is my
boring um I am a lamps camera story
anyways continuing with the tour I
actually have this beautiful window in
my room which creates so much nice
natural light um I really shouldn't be
showing you exactly where I live but
coming in from my window we have this
nice little setup here that I've got I
just put a giant wall mirror down on my
desk because I thought it would be a
really cute like way to spice up the
area um it makes the room appear bigger
because mirrors always make rooms look
huge that's a great tip if you a small
room put in a bunch of mirrors because
it'll like triple the size of the room
um so let's see what else for decorating
I put a little magazine here is really
cool um again with the crazy placemats
these are from Z Gallerie my mom got
them for me for Christmas umm so those
make like my desk look nice um fun easy
tip I just love these bags from Sephora
so I put some lace fro in then so they
looked a little more luxurious than just
sitting there and they make a great
decoration because they match the whole
block of my aesthetic um note some paper
weights and some of my nice makeup that
I use everyday sitting there so good all
that let's see what else oh um I keep my
phone in my keys here all the time this
is another one of those bathroom things
that's crystalline black so I got it
also at HomeGoods like nine dollars um
so yeah that's this little area and not
to mention I'm gonna start taking a lot
of pictures here because it's so cute
you got the bed in the background my
lamp and it's just a great little mirror
so that's my little little uh mini
vanity desk okay so as for wall
decoration these are just again like
matte black super cute frames I got
these at HomeGoods too and you can see
they're adorable and what's cool about
the frames is I got all three of them so
they all match and like kind of
cohesively blends the room together as
you can see there's not any actual
pictures on the picture frames yet
because I'm lazy and haven't gotten
around to it yet but I will eventually
put black and white photos in there
because that will keep the aesthetic of
the room going um and it'll be super
cute so for now that's really sad okay
anyways alright so we'll move on to over
here now you probably recognize this
because this is what I have as the
backdrop kind of for all my pictures on
Instagram um you can see them this is
what's always in the background
because if you look this way that's
where my selfie station is so you can
see in the backdrop that's this so
anyways sorry for the dizzying confusion
I got this gel from Ikea it was like 50
bucks I think I made it myself installed
it same with this shelf I just installed
that myself super easy so I put some of
my most fabulous things out on display
here we got my purses and some of my
favorite pairs of shoes um so that's
like a super cute little shelf area very
luxurious and I got my calendar here
hidden all this excited there's not I
don't have that busy of a life I've like
nothing going on in October but anyways
okay um so let's see what else we got
some white roses because those are my
favorites
I actually made both of these displays
because flower arrangements are so
expensive for some reason so literally I
just bought some fake flowers online and
then tapped them into and little glasses
and both of these costs like 10 bucks
each instead of the like $89 that you
would spend on line now this you might
see hanging in the background but that's
just like one of my silky bathrobes I
read online somewhere that it was like
tips to make your bedroom sexier um and
it's said to leave like a piece of
lingerie or like something hanging um
down outside of your closet and I was
like wow who doesn't want a sexy bedroom
so I hung that up there I don't know if
it's working but I don't know and also
like poles together black - thetic so
that's the story of why I have my
bathrobe hanging outside of my closet um
on a wreath hanger anyways anyways that
aside if you saw my DIY closet video you
know what I'm gonna do next but here we
go this is my closet my love child I'm
obsessed with this I just read this um
the other day so you can click the links
to see all the full tour but yeah I got
all my clothes in here um
color-coordinated all my shoes and
everything my beloved chandelier that
I'm obsessed with and you know
everything else so um that's my little
closet tour really quickly and then here
we go this is my little uh just one more
piece of furniture I'll talk about the
furniture in a second but a fun way to
decorate is to bring out your nice
Jewellery I got these at um I think Joe
hands or maybe Amazon and they were
super cheap they're like $5 for a little
store display and I just put my nicest
jewelry out um because I want to be
robbed no I'm just kidding but because
it looks super nice I'm wearing these
reins usually they're sitting there but
not all my jewelry hanging out because
that adds aesthetic can make so pretty
um let's see so oh yes I was gonna talk
about my furniture
alright so sitting on the floor is tile
um all of my furniture is from a place
called Madani furniture it's white
lacquer so it's beautiful I just keep
all of my clothes and purses a dresser
I'm not very organized so yeah don't
look um but it's white lacquer is so
nice this furniture was way more money
than I would ever spend on anything else
but I figured this was the furniture I'm
going to have for the rest of my life
pretty much cuz when am I gonna get sick
of white furniture never I would imagine
but I guess talked to me in 10 years and
I'll probably say I want like brown wood
furniture um no that would actually
never happen anyways um yeah so modani
furniture I saw on Keeping Up with the
Kardashians and it happened to be right
across the street from my house so I was
like I gotta get my ass over there so I
did bought all the furniture I bet I
have this piece and then I also have
that desk over there and then um that
little guy is also from modani
okay I'm stood up because I was like
really hurting my ass anyways um moving
along from there you guys can see my
bathroom which isn't really my favorite
part of my room but this is where I did
my DIY em marble countertop which is
totally lasted and still looks freakin
awesome by the way
um so I keep all of my nice makeup out
here this is where I do my makeup every
morning is in this mirror despite it not
having the best lighting I prefer to do
my makeup here than anywhere else so
I'll just sit here and pipe my face in
here and of course this little like
medicine cabinet thing everyone has one
of those um again I have oh I got these
from home goods they're so beautiful
my little soap dispensers so nice and
then I have the matching I'm not really
sure what this was is empty so I put
white flowers in it and my shower which
is kind of gross my toilet um I've got
another one of those things
I love sitting on that and then a nice
little um picture frame put a quote in
it you know it'll look great my black
towels also DIY crystallizing towels and
so on some uh what is this ribbon this I
actually got from the 99 cent store I
believe it or not they have them in
white and black and pink and it totally
looks exactly the same as my one outside
from Ikea but this one is really small
like as you can see it's the size of my
hand and the other one was like
humongous um so there we had that that's
my bathroom Oh actually wait one more
thing um that is the crystalized
trashcan that I was talking about my Q&amp;amp;A
video that was like $150 I mean it's
beautiful but that was definitely stupid
of me to buy but I like it um well so I
put a little gray carpet in here just so
it's more fun to do my makeup
um so ho that's pretty much my room oh
actually one more thing
I put the boa I threw me for my bed this
is just like a black boa I got it at
Joanne's it's like seven dollars but it
makes everything look really luxurious I
just thought the foot of my bed looked
cooler with it so I lay that there um
and put my slippers out front so there
you have you guys that is my bedroom to
her I hope you guys enjoyed it was fun
taking you around and there's not
