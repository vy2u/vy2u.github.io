doesn't make any sense but what I just
thought this was cute I'm wearing a lot
of eyelashes because well yeah oh yes my
fancy storage item don't worry you guys
I didn't just buy an empty box again I
actually did buy a fancy perfume but the
box was a special gift from a really
nice Nordstrom lady who was working
there it didn't come with the box but
just saw me eyeing them so she gave it
to me but da it's to expose you can't
see it but this is fancy perfume oh look
at this is so nice and there was a big
doorbuster sales so OOP there we go last
but not least in my big brown bag I got
another brown bag
I need a reusable tote bag to put my
groceries and stuff in and plus when I
go downtown to pick stuff up for
supplies so I just thought this was
super fun and then of course like I said
I have one final surprise for you

other necklace are part of my first ever
real collection so this is my very extra
holiday collection and we two CDs oh my

box as my necklace off with my little
note on it's so cute so we've got the
little solitaire one the band one and
then the little mini pear-shaped one as
for necklaces we got this beautiful
crystal eBird necklace that I just love
so much and then of course we got the
angel wing necklace because of course
you guys are my angels and I wanted
something that really meant a lot to me
and would also mean a lot to you these
are the same quality rings that
Nordstrom sells for literally hundreds
of dollars so this is literally a dream
I can't wait to see them on you guys
so for those of you who ordered a
million necklace that should be in the
mail ASAP and these are officially
