up guys and welcome back to my channel
and if you clicked on this video and are
confused by my outfit I just thought
since it is going to be a very revealing
vlog I would at least bundle up for the
intros but since it's actually May in
Los Angeles it's like really hot so I
picked it off before I boiled to death
so what's up guys ever welcome back to
my channel and if you are new hello
welcome to the weirdest video you could
have possibly clicked on to welcome you
to this channel Oh today I literally
just thought I was going to go bra
shopping anyway so I figured I might as
well take you guys with me so if you
want to see me try on a bunch of bras
and the struggle to find anything that I
like today is your lucky day
the official unofficial bra shopping
vlog 2017 begins right now
I thought my fluffy bedroom slides would
be hilarious to wear for a bra vlog so
what I'm wearing fufufu killin it
alrighty so our first stop is going to
be Tuesday max see if I can find
anything I love this week a it's
honestly going to be very hard for me to
stay like not distracted and actually
buy bras and not crystals you know
whatever I can find
but what oh ok so the reason I come to
stores like this is because I actually
have a very large chest
I'd like a 34 double D so cool thing
about places like this is they always
have really big sizes for teens because
no one else like them so I always score
and let them like oh my gosh I'm
literally a giant hodge podge
hmm-hmm-hmm believe it or not they even
have sizes bigger than mine look at that
46 double D who's crazy you kind of got
a shuffle through them because they're
not very organized but eventually you'll
find your sign no no no try this on all
righty here we go
while you guys not a single one of the
work so womp both of us will try
somewhere oh all right we're going to
try Nordstrom Rack next because just
like Nordstrom but like keeper so
fabulous I'll write it here we go
semester Rack is actually a little more
organized they have all sorts of fun
drawers and stuff like I don't even know
what these are but try this out later
anyways here we go got all of the brand
name mmm and it's just paper
anyways that's across just a UPS already
now
alrighty I picked out 3,000 so let's try
them on
well guys those were actually so bad I
couldn't even film them at all so we're
just going to walk over to the mall try
something new
whoo I'm turning into a go okay one of
the best tricks when shopping for bras
is come somewhere where there's plenty
of sports go in because I think as I've
proven it is not always easy to find
what you're looking for
so go to a mall go to a big shopping
center go to something where there's
lots of options and plenty of
destruction no I'm kidding don't get
distracted so keep looking
alright we're going to try HMS because I
don't know I've gotten a lot of bras
where in the past when we might as well
try it like look at this they have so
much stuff it's awesome
all right let's see anything for to me
hmm these are fun we will try these on
the bras be over to actually some super
cute little satin shirts I'm going to
get so the bra today we're shopping
today is actually from H&amp;amp;M that's this
one I'm going to try on something
similar
all right well hey I look like Christmas
be it this is not fit properly I'm not
really sure what's going on here so mm
cannon really feel this one because it
is way too small I don't like this one
either
all right epic fail number three but we
forgot these short papers guys I
actually cannot believe what an epic
failure this has been so far whoo our
three destruction anyways to the bras
oh right it you guys know I love forever
21 but they also actually have something
or bronze and I get quite to see this
line here oh okay so this is going to be
all stops well guys a forever 21 usually
has all sorts of cool things like it
will relax in all the colors but um of
course today when I'm filming abroad log
there is literally not a single thing in
my bag zips I'm so perfect anyone never
fails me but maybe hover one-eighth of
my right Victoria's Secret
you are my last hope please help me oh
my god these sets are so cute I'm dying
a mood Wow I wasn't so sick oh let me
tell you my lingerie collection would be
slowly all right while we're in here I'm
going to do a quick little bra shopping
101 so there's literally a zillion
million billion different kinds of bras
out there and it's all up to you to
figure out which one please you bet so
here I have two bras from the same
collection but obviously very different
this one has no padding in it you can
see it's literally just like nothing's
you can see from the underside there's
literally nothing in it at all and this
one has a lot more support it actually
has like a cup in it so there's still no
padding and this one but it will offer a
little bit more support than this one I
personally enjoy boobs are so big I like
the kind like this just because I like
to minimize them as much as possible I
personally like bras with underwire
because I need that just because it kind
of lifts them up a little bit more than
a bra without it as this one where you
can see there's no wire there it's
literally just kind of more like a bra
letting this does not work for me at all
of course there's my worst nightmare
push ups wrong what's up rod you can see
it winter we have a boob built into the
bra so this is great for a smaller chest
just want to make it look bigger but for
girls like me this is really just going
to make me look like a whale so random
side note no my thumb is not bleeding it
just looks like that because I tried out
a new color at CVS earlier and I
couldn't get it off so that's the story
on that rings on sleek though it also
something called sister sizes which I
just found out about recently and boy
has it changed sedin and basically the
roll is I even had like one of the
deployers write it down for me because I
kept messing it up if you go up a number
like 32 to 34 then you go to goes down a
letter I know that's kind of hard to
explain but basically it just means
there's actually two bra sizes that you
can wear for example if you're a 34b
just add a cup size to make it a C and
subtract one number size 32 vice versa
if you want to subtract a cup size a you
would add one number size 36 so if
you're a 34b your sister sizes that you
can also wear our 32 c and a 36 a mass
is definitely not my strong point but
that's my attempt at a summary and bam
you got double the amounts of bras you
can try on cut all the most boring broad
sewer a nude one no but seriously on the
just what I need there's no padding no
nothing's definitely going to try this
one on
alright guys this is all you need to see
not only came because well because the
best boring blog I love it so um well I
guess I do feel a little awkward doing
this but I'm saying if this is no
different than trying on bikini hop so
here we go um I computed this super low
number one you can see it's really lazy
I'm actually super cute and fits pretty
good um I actually really like that they
always have these groovy little try me
on t-shirts so that's super nice of them
I can see what it looks like under a
shirt well if I don't ruin the store
they're okay for this one really quick
well you can't really tell in this
mirror but you can actually totally see
through the shirt you can see the
pattern kind of sticks out so this one
might have to go to special occasions
but I do like it
so we'll see alright next up is the very
boring t-shirt broad I mean you need one
just because it's not that exciting
doesn't mean it not good I always have
problems with side boob it's always like
hanging out and looking gross but it's
actually manages to get it all so what
that's a pretty cool room is I don't
even know what size this is let me check
so this one is a 34 double D and not
even that bad 3450
you like are always asking what kinda
strapless bras I wear and the answer is
I give up on them literally so long ago
there just isn't one that fits me or
work for big natural boobs as far as I'm
concerned like look at this they assured
me that this was the best one and you
can see it technically fit but like
there's no lift at all like I want my
boobs to be where they belong sitting up
there and instead they're down here so I
think they natural boobs just work so
what I usually do is I'll just wear my
regular bra and when that has a little
more support at the bottom so it stays
up and I'll just go to press down like
that or just won't wear it at all
thank you
yay mission accomplished you guys
mission accomplished
oh look at that aesthetic show up
already guys so I'm back are you ready
to see my full loot mmm great ready so
here's what I got um you saw I did end
up getting that plain boring bra from
Victoria Secret the t-shirt bra what's
going on here that anyway so I got the
very not extra at all t-shirt bra you
could see - I actually ended up getting
quite a few of them because you can see
it's only $34 but if you got two or more
they were only $22 each so I got three
of them fabulous
what else did I get oh yeah I also got
this like free tote bag with purchase so
I don't even know what this looks like
let's open it
Oh cute fun summer beach bag okay so got
that got all the Broads what else
oh I randomly got some beauty blenders
from TJ Maxx because they were like
three dollars I know that's not a profit
that is what I bought um what else
I'm H&amp;amp;M I got those green silky shorts
from H&amp;amp;M so cute and oh and I got some
underwear because they were on sale for
$3 so that's my look you guys tada so
there are you guys that is what I got um
I hope you enjoyed my really weird
little bra shopping adventure because
despite the fact that was like kind of
an odd video to film I really had quite
a good time filming it because it was a
success after like 10 million fails but
you know as long as you win in the end
it doesn't matter what happened in the
journey right I'm totally good
it's like the world's worst quote but
anywho ZZZ
as always if you have any questions
comments concerns all my socials are at
Amber's also hit me up on there I love
you guys so very much I hope you stay
fabulous and enjoy your own personal bra
shopping uh yeah I guess that's all I
have to say today I love you kids until
