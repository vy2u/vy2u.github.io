today hmm no really I want you to guess
I quit on this video we hadn't said all
about your rings in the title and
literally already know exactly what it's
about well then congratulations you're
right we are talking about my rings
today I'm only wearing one for some
ungodly reason actually maybe I'm going
to go put on more what oh yes much
better oh good day I'm going to go ahead
and answer the questions that are always
being asked all about my Wilde ring
collection because I do love me a meme
cubic zirconia so basically I'm just
going to show you what they're it's
sparkly little ring blog where I give my
personal collection and where you can
get your own so without further ado I
don't know what that was compose myself
again without further ado my ring
all righty so I think you see I have a
ton of rings and to be honest this isn't
even half of them so we're going to go
ahead and start out with this one
because it becomes two rings
bigger is better oh all right so as you
can see this is just a beautiful cushion
cut diamond it's huge it's like a
bajillion carat I'm obsessed with it I
love to wear it with this little sparkly
counterpart which I don't know why the
sunlight is doing this one so dirty
right now this is actually a beautiful
ring it's just like not looking so
beautiful for some reason so I like to
wear them together because they make me
look like a real offense a housewife's
lady in fact this is the ring that I
pretended I was married with it's a
Starbucks the other day if you guys
follow me on Twitter you already know
what I'm talking about but long story
short and I was like sitting in a
Starbucks and I told a guy that I didn't
have a phone to avoid giving him my
number and then it literally started to
ring in my pocket like at that exact
moment
uh-huh so then I was just like oh I
guess I prodded but I married hahaha who
is married with a 30 carat engagement
ring on there like right handed pinky
finger I don't know he left me alone
after that but like good lord I really
need to work on like better things to
say that was so unfortunate well next up
we have my infamous beautiful rose gold
TJ's ex ring I love this ring I got it
at TJ Maxx for literally like $30 I've
never seen a ring that looks quite like
this is just like a clear rosy gold oh
my gosh it's so beautiful
I wear it on its own because I don't
know it's a statement piece it likes to
be solo OOP glittery put love following
the Rosie gold ring my gold rings I love
these I forgot be that Dillard's for $10
each like how random is that but they're
so pretty they're like a beautiful amber
color hahaha I love the way them
together because the more the merrier
when it comes to sparkles and I really
love them the most because they really
match my eye like look at this who cover
it was really sunny so I like had the
blinkin didn't work out so my eye so
anyways out of the song they're real
quick for my colored rings I have to
speed up a little peridot this is
actually my birthstone I was born in
August so peridot is the birthstone it's
like nice little green I like to wear it
with all my readings because you know
the more the merrier like I said before
it's just super cute really liked it it
was super cheap - it was like $11
downtown all righty here we go my newest
children you probably recognize me from
snapchat
these are the rings that I got in Vegas
I am literally
in love with them they're so beautiful
and I'll these were probably my first
ever like splurge item I've ever bought
myself they were both pretty expensive
each ring was like $175 I believe but
they were on sale so they're actually
$500 rings but I got them for half off
so it weren't that much of a splurge
because I literally walked next door
from the casino that I bought them in
and wandered into Harry Winston and
literally the exact same looking ring
was four and a half million so if you
look at it that way I got a bargain
thank you whoever invented the cubic
zirconia Thank You Thomas a ring I was
just showing you no I'm just kidding
this is actually a different version
believe it or not I got this one on
Amazon this one is a nice sparkly
cushion cut so you can see it's slightly
different and this one has them little
diamonds on the side so you can see them
side by side there they are different
you know sort of whoo look at this one I
love love love the funky shaped diamonds
this is beautiful little pear diamond
sitting in sun glowing like a beauty you
can see it has two little beanie ones
and I just love this one because they
provide any of you guys it looks kind of
like angel wings sort of if you really
stretch your imagination so 11 my little
angel pair ring okay so I have just one
in Vegas too this one was not even close
to as expensive as those other ones this
one was literally 2250 in a gift shop
and I'm obsessed with it it's again the
emerald cut diamonds I'm so pretty it
has like the little halo of diamonds
around it so makes it look even a little
bit bigger than it already is
Wow look at that baby shine makes me
look hella bougie and that's the last
one for now I think but basically that
is my ring collection so there are you
guys that is all about my rings hope you
