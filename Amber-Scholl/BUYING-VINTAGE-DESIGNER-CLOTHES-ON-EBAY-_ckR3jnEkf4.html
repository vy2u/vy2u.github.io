actually 2018 but you know who cares for
the purposes of this video - what wait
2007 nobody knows when I uploaded it I'm
pretty sure it actually says when I
uploaded it in the description box so
maybe this is gonna be an issue but you
guys ever welcome back to my channel you
guys know I am obsessed with a shopping
but being shopping online and absolutely
I've been super into vintage things so I
have been Oh about that eBay life and I
just wanted to show you guys a couple of
the groovy things that I've gotten
recently in some mail so without further
ado here we go designer clothing haul
broke bitch style because we're buying
them used off eBay but nobody has to go
by you guys secrets safe with you and I
guess the rest of the Internet okay so
that actually have nothing to do with
anything but my best friend Bailey just
graduated from law school and I
surprised her with tickets to the Taylor
Swift concert it was absolutely amazing
we had the best time so huge shout out
to sea geek for gifting me the tickets
if you don't know about them yet they're
basically an app that has all the best
deals on tickets for all your favorite
live events so you could jam out just
like we did by the way if you guys want
to go to they are offered $20 off your
first order code amber there you go you
welcome have fun kids
all right so you guys can see I actually
kind of already decorated my floor with
everything but here we know we're just
gonna get started with them well I guess
what I'm wearing I have been super into
90s early 2000s fashion lately I'm just
sick of all my clothes so we're going
through a phase where I want to like
look like 2002 Paris Hilton basically so
oh my god are you kidding me this is
freaking iconic like oh my gosh this is
such a freakin pro bag and of course the
matching pants - they make your booty
look so pop and I forgot how much I love
these the only problem is I bought a
child's 12 so they are too short but F
okay y'all know I'm crafty so I'm gonna
have them into shorts but there you go
we're ready to go walk Tinkerbell in
this step alright so moving on from this
to more pink things I don't know what
disease it is where you suddenly want to
wear like
pink all the time but uh I got some more
pink so there it is hmm okay so I admit
this looks boring as PO when it's on the
ground here but just wait Oh Jackie
Kennedy who it's Amber Kennedy actually
no it's amber styles but locate
President Kennedy was hot I can't
believe I said that on camera but
everyone knows it so okay here is this
look what we did you guys a little while
ago asking you for some fashion and so
and so so many of you sent me this
picture 90 Chanel runway was like so
freaking iconic I can't even believe it
so I was you can see we put the crop
pink jacket and of course the matching
black skirt the only problem is when
you're buying stuff like this is it only
comes in one size so you have to get it
altered aka this is way too big so
obviously to make it a little more hoe
we're gonna hike the skirt up you know
probably gonna have it looking a little
more like this but it's gonna be so cute
once it's altered I can't wait oh it
also came with a little vest too so
that's gonna be fun once I get back to
fit too because you know it's a little
big so I want it to be more like that
but for now we're gonna look like this
so anyway is gonna show you the next
thing because I need to take this to the
tailor okay you guys are literally going
to die when you see this next one oh is
a vintage 2002 runway Tochi and Capanna
jean jacket oh my god even has the
crystal logo on the neckline I screamed
a thousand screams when I saw this
online this one was one of the splurge
items at 175 but uh guess what that
vintage designer boutique down the
street that I freaking love was selling
shorts that matched this a few months
ago for over a thousand dollars so in my
opinion I got the pretty bag in deal
not to mention this needs no alterations
it just fits perfect and oMG that
neckline go oh oh all right so since
we're already doing denim jackets we'll
go ahead and do my other big-ticket item
I can't say but you know doesn't stop me
okay the jacket
we've got Christians your monogram pink
jacket oh my god this is amazing this is
a literally one of the coolest jacket
I've ever seen it's so cute
I am just in love with it these jackets
are reselling for over $1,300 however
I've got a maker steel on this one
because I see that I'm pretty gnarly
same on this one I'm crafty we know this
so I'm gonna go ahead and replicate the
patchwork and put one over here too so
then you'll never know and I only paid
150 for this one match the jacket slash
also not really because it doesn't
really match it but it is a lacy satin
Dior oh how cool like you can see up
close it has the monogram on there so I
bought this which again you can see it's
like really really big but once I get it
tailored to fit me it's gonna be super
cute alrighty the next item on the list
is actually not designer but I thought
it was so cute I had to show it anyway
guess who were being we are going false
Tara from clueless vibes on this one oh
my god oh I'm dead you know what's funny
it's about this outfit is this is
literally a costume but I don't care
we're gonna wear it in real life because
it is frickin adorable like all paired
together like this
oMG this is such a fricken look ooh yes
slime mama
so next we're continuing the plaid trend
with something I actually wore in a
video the other day ah what I almost hit
myself in the face with that did you
guys see that anyways
here we go this is a red plaid dress how
cool is this ah vintage Dolce and
Gabbana so cool of course with the tags
intact ah totally random side note it's
so gloomy outside today I'm trying to
film things and everything looks ugly
but I mean the view is amazing but you
know the clothes needs sunshine anyways
you know you can imagine it anyway
I literally wore this in an outfit of
the day already remember from this video
ooh it was so cute like you can see it's
actually really long but I'm of course
you know gonna get it hemmed like I had
it in that video since we're already
hung until chanc about a trend we're
gonna keep it up with more Dolce was
just a super popular brand back then so
that's why there's so much of it on eBay
right now but look how cute this is this
is just like a classic little blue dress
you can see the little logo on the
zipper there yes sir for this up all the
way by myself but you can see the piping
in the back is so pretty the only thing
about this one really is it said it was
black online and it is definitely maybe
but you know I don't care it gives it
more of a nautical vibe and I still like
it but that's something you got to be
wary of when you're ordering on eBay a
lot of times the descriptions will lie
okay so I know it's that a lot of things
are my favorite thing that I got but
this actually is my favorite thing that
I got goodbye I'm screaming I'm living
in another dimension oh my god this is
90s Chanel runway belt oh my god this
has been literally one of my dream
purchases for so long whoever owned this
outfit anyway this is also from ebay
this skirt is actually Louis Vuitton you
can see real small the logo on the
zipper there the top actually isn't
designer at all it's just like a really
cool zel's it corset thing so I thought
when paired together it all looked like
the 90s Edie cannot really oh I'm going
for these days and next we have this
magnificent work of art okay so I know
you're thinking amber have you lost your
mind well yes I have but that's suddenly
not reference to this outfit at all in
fact you just gotta have an imagination
though obviously this does not fit very
good at all however the base of it is
super cute so I'm gonna make it fab I
doing this this still looks crazy what
would I have a professional actually do
it and not just roll it up this is going
to become a miniskirt and I'm gonna have
the jacket kind of cut into a crappie
jacket so then it's gonna be more like a
mini Beaumont soup set you'll see what
it's done it's gonna be fab so like I
said stay tuned for Instagram because
they look a gonna be pop it so here we
go next look I almost just fell over
alright business amber reporting for
duty so next thing we've got of course
along the suit train as well absolutely
this is vintage guests I got this for
only $40 see it has like a little floral
e design on the fabric which is like so
freakin fun skirt looks like so 2000s
actually wore this to the Becca
cosmetics party that I was at last
week's not to mention this one
no tailoring so that's an added bonus
last but not least these are not
designer at all but these are just cool
vintage sweatshirts that I got I just
thought they were like so funds mm-hmm

wants to be comfy - thank you guys that
