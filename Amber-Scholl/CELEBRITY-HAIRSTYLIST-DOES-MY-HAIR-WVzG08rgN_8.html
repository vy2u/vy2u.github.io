think of my like messy lion hair oh my
god it looks like I haven't taken a
shower in like five days I have I swear
it just is messy but anyway what's up
guys it's amber and welcome back to my
channel so today in case you can't tell
we have a special guest in the house
whoa
it was my best friend Josh and he is a
celebrity hair stylist so he's been gone
on tour for the last like however many
months and I thought it would be fun
since he is back on a break really quick
to have him do my hair for you guys to
watch so we're turning my room into a
head studio today
voila look at all the fancy hair people
stuff oh my god this looks like I'm
getting like something really serious
done but really we're just doing a
ponytail but just two ponytails ooh so I
don't look at how cool Josh dresses look
at this a look tell us what you're
wearing um so this is Louie Vuitton this
is top man leather pants that I
accidentally ripped and Soller on boots
runway
you would look it up alright so what are
we doing first Josh so first we're going
to flat iron your entire head hmm
so I thought we'd play 20 questions with
Josh while we get ready so Josh why do
you know me we went to college together
actually we had a blast in college
together we went to Pepperdine classes
well he was older than me but I bar one
year by one year but yeah we had it so
much fun and yeah we bonded over our
love of celebrity culture and now look
at this wow I'm styling hair for
celebrities and amber is a celebrity oh
stop on the next step what we're going
to do is we're going to go ahead and put
like a high shine pomade that has high
hold around the hairline so you're just
going to kind of massage it into the
hairline and basically what this is
going to do it's going to keep any of
these little baby hairs up front from
falling forward that's going to give
like that super high shine you know
polished look great Thank You Joshua by
the way doing a ponytail takes a long
time
people think that it takes two seconds
but believe it or not to get it nice and
sleek you want to go ahead and put all
that pomade and you want to brush the
pomade throughout the hair or along the
entire perimeter just to make sure you
get all the little flyaways this is
halarious only I would vlog a hairstyle
ring so you keep brushing into it and
you go ahead and hold it you know after
that you're going to go ahead and grab
yourself a heavy-duty extra firm hold
hairspray you go ahead and spray it all
along the hairline all over when you
think you put too much put more hold
your breath because it's a very potent
it smells bad unfortunately that's the
price of beauty so josh is very humble
and he won't brag but I will brag for
him Josh can you please tell tell the
people all of the really cool people
that you're worthless so I have worked
with whether it's assisting or being
lead on jobs I have worked with like Kim
Kardashian ariana grande Emily
Ratajkowski isla Fisher Olivia Munn I've
also worked with like Lana Del Rey on
music videos so you know I worked with a
whole bunch of people
I flipped out when he told me that like
literally screamed and cried also
Courtney news to me by the way why josh
has been literally brushing my hair for
like ten minutes are you done yet
straight up it requires a lot a lot of
tender love and care I had got no
patience for this men by the way why
this is like a random story time but
since this has been going on for 500
years um I was downtown today and I lost
my car like could not remember where I
parked and it took me two hours of just
wandering the streets to find it so I'm
like very frazzled still and I'm
starving by the way it's really hungry
what is the lamest thing about me hmm
he's lucky that was in his mouth so if
you ever see you ponytail and then you
see that it's like super nice and tie
and cute don't forget that like they
probably have a hair wrap so what you're
going to do to give it that extra little
prop up instead of laying low like that
you're going to go and put another hair
band right up here value inch and a half
to two inches right off of the base the
base thing this and you're going to tie
it as tight as you can
oh my god I'm shook secret
so anything that's in here is not going
to be this isn't going to move up and
down its condado tight that it's it
won't move and this is going to serve as
your anchor point so when you put your
little ponytail wrap on it it can hook
onto here I'm hilarious I literally look
bold oh my god anyway so I got a new
hair extension thing for this by the way
this is like a really long what even is
this dog show pony yup it's a ponytail
wrap yo a pony tail wrap doesn't have
any little baby hairs at the top it's
basically long left sewn into a little
piece that has a little hook on the
sides and two little ribbons on the ends
so what you're going to do you're going
to go and tie these two ribbons together
as tight as you can
so that way amber has that extra
security and it doesn't move throughout
the day whether she's doing you know
jumping jacks gymnastics or somersaults
you know the usual you know that's what
I always do yeah you may want to tie it
once and then just wrap again and knot
it
she looks cute mm-hm so our doing this I
thought it'd be fun to do like a weird
little best friend and a mini version so
here's the 30 second round are you guys
ready so Josh what's my favorite color
good gosh your favorite color gold
marbles diamonds is that a color cuz
that's it that's my friend so now so now
we're going to do the Raby thing okay
grabbing a small piece what you're going
to do is hairspray as you wrap around
making this it's going to keep on
wrapping and now it looks like you have
no hair band and that you are just a
perfect genie in a bottle
I know so I don't with a dickwad
sure I don't even know what questions
I'm supposed to ask I literally googled
best friend tag questions so here we go
so who is my celebrity crush hmm either
Harry Styles or Harry Styles ding ding
ding oh my god this is funny how long
does it take me to get ready
she doesn't get ready or if she's
filming a YouTube video let's be very
specific here it'll take her about
thirty minutes to an hour what is the
craziest thing we ever did together
craziest thing we ever did together one
better not say really no low-key your
class would come after us now this is
unfortunately very accurate I will tell
this in a story time so amber what's my
favorite color black ding ding not a
color but it's a shade but you still got
it so there we go you can see it's like
you would never know but oh my gosh this
is so cool mmm you guys am i Princess
Jasmine so after you finish the ponytail
you're going to go ahead and go around
the perimeter of the hair you see that
anything is like popping back up go in
and just try to flatten it out with the
flat oh my god is that a knife no it's a
rat tail comb oh my with a butter knife
it looks like you're killing me does
this not look like a knife you guys I
totally second looks like I'm a scalping
yeah you're I'm afraid I don't like this
whoo okay so now what we're going to do
is write exactly what we did to the
front we're going to do to the back we
want to make sure that the back little
baby hairs aren't sticking out at all so
don't forget you have to be clean 360
degrees around the head whoo season lane
so like you can see this is like soap in
versus decide which I would bulb oh my
gosh this is so cool oh so I'm done look
at how long this is whew I need to shave
my sideburns I started shaving my face
by the way you guys so if you want to
know about that I will tell you but I
notice that sideburns one day so I
started to just shave them and you're
coming back so anyways whatever I'll do
is shaving my face video later but
literally I just copy Carly Bibles
routine so if you want to look that up
work at side side and sizzle look at
that thanks Josh of course some little
Pantene commercially prepared you guys
that is how Josh does the fancy
celebrity ponies oh I don't look at that
because I like real girl bitch anyway
it's so weird to be doing this with
someone else by the way it's like it's
pretty hard isn't it yeah you see this
is actually like not an easy job no it's
not hi amber is 100% do-it-yourself
except when I am someone do my hair

this exact moment but she literally will
