today do you recognize where we are this
is my old apartment this is actually the
day before I'm moving so we're doing a
little bit of backtracking here but hi
this is the last video I filmed in here
so you can see it's completely empty
aside of you know the Harry Styles
cutouts which are very festive for the
holidays but anyway what's up guys amber
welcome back to my channel and also a
side of the mess please excuse my bare
face whoo we're doing a makeup video
today so I just have nothing on and this
is so weird but I do have red nails
which is also very festive but anyways
I'm rambling so it's a day be good
friend Daniel is gonna come over and
he's going to do my makeup his the
celebrity makeup artist extraordinaire
so I just thought it'd be fun to see how
he beats my face for the holidays so
we're just gonna wait for him to get
here and uh oh
actually it's probably him calling me so
we're gonna pause this and go get him
from the depths of LA barking hello
chilla hi guys he's gonna be doing our
makeup today you can see look what a
stylish man this is outfit of the day
killing it with my dirty miles of stuff
in the background anyways so we're just
gonna go ahead and get started any any
words to say to YouTube I'm excited
we're gonna have a lot to say so uh here
we go without further ado celebrity
makeup artist does my makeup that's
fancy
okay so what kind of look are we doing
today we are doing a glowy bronzy
holiday look oh that's perfect I would
prefer to be immunity look at all the
makeup oh my goodness this is gonna be
so fun there's so many different things
oh my god that's all the brushes and of
course we've got our beautiful lashes
we've got the kiss lash Couture faux
mink collection oh my goodness like look
at how fluffy and thick and beautiful
they are I'm so excited to put these on
I literally look so bold without them so
make your kiss for small during this
video y'all are the best David sent me
this cute little note how cute are they
alright so anyways you can see oh my
goodness we have so many to pick from
different lengths curls angles Wow and
like the lash cream today innovative
synthetic and human hair so you can see
they look like supernaturally fabulous
with the tapered edges like I said
they're faux mink which is so nice and
save the animals and of course we got
the glue we got the white in the black
to keep these peppers in place all day
so for affordable too you can reuse them
like 10 times they're only $5.99 at
Walgreens totally baller so are you
ready to get started great so what are
we gonna start with today we're gonna
start with foundation because I figured
you would one you know please give me
all of it Samia Daniel met because him
and Josh worked together you guys were
on tour together yes yes so they just
got back so I thought it would be fun
since you guys liked my video with Josh
so much you guys remember that one super
fun this will be better this one will be
better Josh you have a competition so I
just thought it'd be fun to do a makeup
version of that video mm-hmm oh yes
lovely it's like a weird massage
what foundation do we is what I use the
Burberry oh okay cool click the NARS
sheer glow don't judge my leaking time
this is so me let's give you a little
bit of street cred here because people
are want gonna want to know who are some
of your favorite people that you've
worked on before Sophia Ricci
keke palmer I just got up for with our
and that was super fun so I've been with
her for about three years
how cool is that so I am using the Mac
what is it it's got painterly Pro
Longwear Paint Pot and it's a shadow
base and I love it it makes everything
look good oh that's all I need my gosh
look how pretty this is Wow
so this is what we're gonna use on my
eyes yeah yeah perfect
oh this is so like I could fall asleep
is that bad can I sleep yeah actually
yeah wow great has anyone ever fallen
asleep while you did her makeup yeah
like a model she literally almost fell
off the chair I had to like grab her oh
my God look at that we're like Inception
it over here so what do you think is the
biggest makeup mistake that people make
for me is when people feel like they
have to use everything they feel like
they have to use nine hundred products
in most cases that's not the case I
always tell people to use what makes
them feel beautiful so don't feel like
you have to fit the standard of beauty
don't feel like if someone tells you you
have to wear the red lipstick you have
to wear a lipstick because it's left the
case I love that look at the glittery
shadows that's the hair indicate oh my
goodness you guys we're getting glittery
up in here I look crazy so close oh wow
if this isn't a look we're just gonna
cover that up because that wasn't
looking super unfortunate right in this
sub this is the Mac concealer by the way
this is um life life okay let's do it
ooh what are we using that this is the
Estee Lauder smoothing powder intensity
I don't know you know I like it cuz it
has like a little shimmer huh my teeth
look really
Oh scheppers my favorite setting your
foundational way oh yes so I like to
press the powder onto your cm so that it
really sets and it doesn't the
foundation doesn't move around so use
like a flat brush hmm what do you think
you guys look beautiful be nice yeah
only nice comments I won't read the
meaningless yes
what so I'm using this really dark matte
powder for contouring oh yes I'm so
weird
make me snatched contouring me make to
the gods I want to look crazy baby look
at that what do you think I love it why
am I like this I don't know I'm sorry
you guys I came here for like serious
content I'm so sorry that we were just
like not going around yeah yeah this

part we get to do my lush so Daniels
over here prepping the lashes yeah woo I
cut off
a bit just to make sure that they were
the right size for your eyes just a tiny
bit off the end and that's it I'm gonna
add the glue so it has a little brush
applicator so that it makes it super
easy to apply and you're supposed to let
this dry like 30 seconds right yeah I
wouldn't wait like 15-20 seconds and
then put it on let it get sticky okay
