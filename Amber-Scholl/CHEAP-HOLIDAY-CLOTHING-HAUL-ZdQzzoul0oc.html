North Pole okay so it's not the North
Pole but I am wearing a big white fuzzy
sweater and an elf hat though by the way
our ankle the camera you can't really do
tell that it just looks like I'm wearing
a really weird earmuff thing but anyways
what is up you guys welcome back to my
channel and today we are kicking off my
favorite time of the year with a holiday
haul you guys know one of my all-time
favorite things in the whole world has
to order stuff from China I do it
literally all the time so today I
thought it'd be fun to do a buying
Chinese clothing haul and show you guys
what I got for the holiday season so
without further ado here we go cheap
clothes from China super festive edition
I don't know what I'm doing this my hair
but go with it alrighty so today I'm
hauling from a website called gum if you
can see right here everything you ever
wanted like oh my god look at it all and
it's not cheap Wow my favorite so shout
out to Camus for green to sponsor my
haul by the way every time I do one of
these videos promoting some of these
cheap websites I get so many comments
saying it's a scam and how dare I
promote a scam you guys I have ordered
off these websites for years literally
yes it takes a long time to come yes
sometimes the products are a little
funny and not exactly what you ordered
but honestly I have never had an issue
everything always shows up eventually
and I mean you can't really complain
you're paying like three dollars for a
sweater so anyways please don't take
this video too seriously you guys this
is just a fun little holiday clothing
haul so here we go without further ado
let's get opening alrighty here we go
you can see it came in a really giant
package it's literally just everything I
sliced it open with a knife earlier but
other than that I haven't seen anything
in here so I guess we're just going to
get started oh there is literally so
much stuff can you believe they fit all
of that in this little package so here
we go
these are the funniest thing I've ever
their little Santa heads oh my god I'm
dying so for the first look we're gonna
pair these with this and see what it
looks like oh my god they literally my
favorite look book I've ever done and
they haven't even started it so tada
here we have our
outfit oh my gosh this is hilarious I
got one that said naughty I'm pretty
sure there was one that said nice but
the Sara feeling naughty mm-hmm I'm
getting anyways these shoes are
literally the funniest things I've ever
seen oh my god you hear that beige Engel
hilarious I literally love this all
right let's see what else I got so many
things to choose from but since we're on
the sweater train we'll go ahead and try
this sweater - whoo Abercrombie I'm
getting but it's gonna be fun so let's
try it
hmm I don't think this one's supposed to
be addressed but whatever we're gonna
wear it as a dress anyways Oh sexy later
this would definitely look a lot better
with leggings so let's see if I have any
I'm pretty sure I bought some yes and
matching ones - this is gonna be good -
oh yes no this is a frickin look you can
see are the Moose sweater which is so
funny I actually used to collect moose
and uh I was gonna say when I was
younger but I was actually did it like
all through high school so if you want a
good chuckle here's a picture of my
moose collection
I know I know I'm a weirdo go with it so
we also got the matching leggings which
are actually so soft I wish there was
feeling you guys would die these are
like I don't know what these are even
made of but they're the softest legging
ever honestly I really dig it
okay so put those over there we're gonna
switch gears just some pink stuff I
don't know what this is but it looks
fantastic this is literally the best
thing I've ever seen so we've got this
little deer sweater I guess this water
could be the girlfriend of the sweater
that I was just wearing you know cute
couple alert anyway if so you can fit
even got lace trim on the bottom I went
ahead and paired it with jean shorts
that are mine I didn't get those online
but I didn't have anything to wear with
these so these are just pink fuzzy
slippers which are like literally again
feel-a-vision the softest I love them I
think I'm gonna order them and liked all
the colors I love them a very strange
but very festive look love it
these really are so soft but anyways
though I know I ordered some cool
accessories too so let's see where those
are somewhere so you can see it's just
like a cute little glory snowman brooch
and this one is like a little Christmas
tree chokers it's just so cute look at
that beautiful goes great with my
necklace huh huh you recognize that you
haven't gotten one yet going kiss below
self chrome oh the dear pom-poms the
Snowman the necklace big mood I'm
literally making such a mess but it's
okay my roommates aren't home so let's
open it because this looks like it's
gonna be fun whatever it is these are
amazing my god these shoes are the
biggest mood we got to pick something
really good to pair with them I don't
know what this is even but let's go with
this okay so I have literally no idea to
put this on but um we're gonna try to
figure it out because this looks too
funny I really look like that part of
Mean Girls
Santa baby
these were actually a lot easier to put
on than I thought you really just have
to tie them but anyways whoo
kind of sexy these dudes are just killer
oh my gosh I actually love these I would
totally wear them you literally look
like an elf this is so fun you guys are
gonna die wait to see who's got to be my
favorite thing I've ever seen so Vincent
literally um it's just a giant Santa
outfit it's a big oversized Santa shirt
you can see it's super fun and then I
got leggings which are definitely a
little too big for me I published or not
in a smaller size but um there we go
it's definitely a look hmm this looks
like it's very oh my god whoosh glamour
elegance grace this is so fun oh my god
I'm living I'll write it right back to
some more practical things we got some
more sweaters it's actually so cute and
this one makes no sense but okay I'll
admit this look literally doesn't match
at all but I like it this sweater it's
actually I think one of my favorite
things I tried on it it's actually a
cute ugly Christmas sweater I like it
paired it with some Santa leggings all
the way down and of course these boots
again oh my gosh literally a whole mood
amazing
this look is just perfect for meeting
your boyfriend's parents for the first
time at Christmas fabulous
sure to make a good impression ooh swap
out the sweater this one is so funny
um fruitcake makes literally no sense
this stuff is just too good I love it
ooh yes mama
work does this make any sense
no do I love it yes okay guys I don't
want to give you nightmares but oh this
hat was supposed to have like a built-in
Santa beard but I don't think that it
worked this looks like something out of
a terror movie but anyways next thing
we'll just move on oh this actually
looks really cute let's try this oh yes
very glamorous
Christmas I just I don't know if I've
ever had this much fun I'm sitting alone
