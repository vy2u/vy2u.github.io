bikini season in Los Angeles but today
it's bikini season in my apartment too
because we're doing a swimsuit haul what
is up you guys
it's amber welcome back to my channel
and today I decided be fun to do a
little fashion show with all my favorite
bikinis and swimsuits for you today to
help us all get into the summer growth
so without further ado here we go
sometimes swimsuit all g-woman
itsy-bitsy teeny-weeny yellow not
polka-dotted bikini catch me in concert
live this summer so a serious look
numero uno the yellow string bikini
because honestly I just wanted to buy
one so I could sing that song so here we
go I got this on Amazon this is an extra
large so if you're gonna get this one I
would definitely recommend sizing up
because it's time it's in it you can see
the booty has got a little bit of
ruching there so yes cute little suit
for only like 15 bucks I think and mind
you look at this gorgeous freakin 10 oh
I'm not good I'm shook so if you're new
to my channel you might not know this
but uh my natural skin tone is actually
really really really pale like really
really I always have to have my golden
glow and I'm so so so excited to
announce my collaboration with naked
skin all natural organic self-tanner the
set comes with the adorable bikini bag
that I designed the bronzed and bougie
you know like bad a Muji but bronzed in
Muji a gradual glo tanning lotion if you
like to build your glow and my personal
favorite the dark tanning mousse which
I'll show you how to use right now so
here you can see me yesterday like I
said I am super super pale so here is uh
you know that look also I'm not wearing
any makeup because I just got out of the
shower embarrassing but there we go you
could see the before so all I do is I go
ahead and take the little tanning mitt
that it comes with pump the mousse on
there and then just literally rub it
onto your body but
to do and that's it arms legs everywhere
it's super easy and goes on really
smooth you can tell it works immediately
but go ahead go to sleep and when you
wake up the next morning Buddha room
Potsdam when you wake up you're at and
glowy golden goddess Wow look at that
before and after shot now that's what I
call a golden cloud these are limited
edition by the way we only made I think
2000 units so if you want to get access
but feel like names in the description
if you want to get your up and PS tweet
me a screenshot of your order and I will
respond to all of them so there you go
your joy being Bronston bougie and now
back to the bikini hall welcome to 1972
I think that's actually totally the
wrong decade for this but you know
whatever who cares about mats so here we
have kind of like a more of a retro
style swimsuit I actually love swimsuits
that are high-waisted because you know
if you're just a little bloated you can
just you know wear this but it sucks it
in for you so here we have this you can
see I actually got this in a small this
is actually pretty cute it's like a
built in push-up bra so that's kind of
fun
I feel like Taylor Swift would totally
wear this kind of like a 1950's beach
princess gotta get a Beach Boys on
alrighty next up we got this pink bikini
which why am i showing it in this
awkward corner of my house because it
doesn't mislaid it you can see it really
doesn't look pink for some reason I
don't know why this particular lighting
does not show the color pink very well I
really don't know what the T is on that
but you can see the color is actually
pink baby pink super cute the back of it
kind of tiny and not a lot of coverage
but you know I can't that to look these
days anyway so well oh that is our pink
that doesn't really look pink all the
time pink bikini sexy Fred Flintstone at
your service
oh my god wait what's his wife's name
Wilma there we go Wilma sexy Wilma after
service everyone come through this suit
is so cute good vibe going on here um
the top actually clearly doesn't fit me
but you know that's actually kind of a
look under boob I also here as in so
there we go it's just because I got a
small so the bottoms would fit probably
should have gotten like a large but you
know whatever you can see it's still
super cute and definitely more of a
scantily-clad look especially from
behind but wow I've been ordered even
literally every color next one of these
wearing a hat so wearing that so this
look is actually a one-piece bikini
um you can kind of see and you can also
see the tags still on it though I'll cut
that off in a minute but there we go you
can see super flattering it pushes your
boobs up nice again covers the little
extra flab if you kappa i just really
love retro looking things so i thought
the happy with fun a little touch to
make it seem a little more you know
old-school no I do love this one I'm
probably gonna order this in a couple
more colors to Dunson uh-oh ready coming
up next we've got Baywatch vibe no no no
no no I don't know the Baywatch theme
song but whatever I actually saw Pamela
Anderson at Starbucks once which is like
so random but anyways here's this look
so this is just a basic red tie up
bikini bikini bottoms which you can kind
of tell our super cheeky this one comes
in like five hundred colors too so if
you like red black blue green print you
can get anything you want
Plus this one was like 15 bucks I think
so pretty good deal if I do say so
myself making Pam
around baywatch exit alright next one
let's see what shall be next oh my gosh
you guys I am left Oh polka-dotted I
just thought this one was super fun
because I love polka dots they kind of
remind me of you know vintage times so
we've got the top here which is a little
small the bottoms are actually really
cute again kind of cheeky with the
high-waisted a little thrill action
right there and oh my gosh honestly who
is just really flattering super super
cute oh my gosh I literally I think this
one actually might be my favorite one
that I've tried on so far which one's
your favorite let me know in the
comments below I feel like such a
youtuber so uh yeah there we go totally
could be Chanel even though it was like
15 bucks on Amazon but you know okay no
one has to know but you guys polka dots
so here is another kind of retro leaf
style swimsuit we've got a strapless top
which is good for tanning you can see it
doesn't like fit that great but you know
whatever comes with the red kind of
high-waisted bottoms again with like the
ruching on the sides not too tight so
that's fun again kind of bootylicious I
don't really want to show too much on
there because this video is already
probably gonna be demonetized but uh ya
know kind of different kind of fun I
love it
that's number eight I think so let's do
nine and ten and then again no I'm
kidding I just like rhymes okay whoo
Hawaiian vacation but as a swimsuit so I
thought this one was fine because it
looked like a lot of those suits you see
on Instagram Boop yeah those it's got
little flowery embellishes on the top
which is so fun at the bottom with some
little side embellish shoes as well
really cute fits really good this is a
large throw so again definitely size up
in this but uh yeah Hawaiian baking
ready for look nine
all righty what should be our last look
and for the grand finale
can you guess we're just going back to
classic retro black again this top is
actually so cute you can see it has like
a really dramatic neckline which makes
you a girl look ace then of course the
high-waisted bottoms which again very
flattering so if we move along here of
course again the Hat because you know
why not it's cool because it's like sexy
but also conservative so you could wear
it to a gay man business yacht party
what do you mean there's no such thing
as business yacht parties I don't know
if it actually exists or not but from
now on that's the only kind of man I'll
accept a business yacht party a man's so
anyway there we go that is Zika and
finale so there you have it you guys
that was my summertime bikini haul I
hope you guys enjoyed the video because
actually I had a great time filming this
one I'm trying on swimsuits in your
house alone could be so much fun but I
guess I'm not really alone I've got
almost you know two million of you
watching me so it's just like a really
weird party as always thank you guys so
so so so much for watching don't forget
if you want to 10 like me well link is
in the description so buy one of those
it'll make me smile don't forget to
subscribe to the channel for lots more
ridiculous content if you haven't
already and while you're here I just
want to say one more thing trust me I'm
the first person to know that bikini
season brings out a lot of insecurities
and let me tell you there is absolutely
no reason that you can't wear anything
you want to wear skinny curvy short tall
big small you know all the rhymes in
there your body loves you so much and
works tirelessly around the clock to
keep you alive and going and doing all
the wonderful things that you do in your
life so please don't hate on it trust me
I spent years of my life doing that and
it just really amounts to actually
nothing so we wrong with you you will be
happier if you cut yourself some slack
nobody's perfect - not even the girlies
in the magazines so next time you're
looking in the mirror and you don't like
the way you look strike a pose anyway
and tell yourself you look freaking
fabulous because guess what you do oh
that's a pee note like I said I love you
kisses till next time my sweet beautiful
baby angels XL
come on babe everybody we're going to
the business yacht party</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
