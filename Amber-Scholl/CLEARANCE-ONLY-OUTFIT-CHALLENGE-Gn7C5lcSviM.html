look ah
so retro I love it up you guys it's
amber welcome back to my channel and
your new hi welcome to the party so
today we're actually on a major time
crunch because I'm going to Coachella
literally and like I don't know not
wearing a watch but like ten hours and
I'm not ready at all but before we go I
wanted to do a quick video for you guys
so we're doing a video so we're gonna go
to the wall and only shopping in the
clearance section see what the most
fabulous outfits I can find and since
I'm the queen of ballin on a budget I
think we're gonna look pretty fabulous
like these were literally 3 dollars what
a steal so without further ado here we
go
clearance section only shopping
challenge so before we get going
as always here's our killer outfit of
the day which of course today it seemed
very retro someone top we just got a
plain black tee a pan with a little
corset belt from the bottom we got the
most fabulous little polka-dotted booty
shorts ever strappy black heels to
complete the look you can get these
anywhere but Oh fabulous fancy ones that
I wore on Instagram ah could you die you
guys always ask if I can actually walk
in these yes
ooh boom you're just like regular heels
but you know fact I can do all sorts of
things whoo ok don't know why I risked
my life for that but anyways alright any
busy let's go
doo doo doo doo doo alright anyways
let's go alrighty here we go
the clearance section oh wait what's for
love what's that oh I meant forever 21
okay here we go
alrighty unfortunately this is not what
we're looking for
we must find I believe it's upstairs we
found it this is the clearance section
so let's see what we can find
don't really know what we're looking for
but basically I've got an hour to film
this video so here we go oh my god
this is what I'm talking about oh so
cute
would you look at that seven and a half
perfect oh my god yes yes yes oh wow
they're really killing it in here and
here's dupes of my shoes see like a fen
you don't have to break the bank to get
the same look except they can't grab all
these okay great
here No
okay mood houndstooth come through there
is literally so much stuff in here I am
literally killing it in here they even
have all sorts of swimsuits and what is
why is this here I love the clearance
section there's always weird stuff like
this in the wrong spot but this looks so
cute too I am literally so pressed for
time oh my god only thing that's hard
about clearance section shopping is I
find stuff that I like like oh my god
the fabric but alas it's not my size so
put that back what else is there okay um
look at this it is like denim heaven in
here so let's see I need like a 24 25
which they rarely have but 26 close
enough alrighty I think we got enough
stuff so let's try it on to the fashion
show
alright I laid some oh my pile out on
the floor here as we can see it better
now a time for fashion show by the way
all these things are unclear Ensign not
making this up so alright here we go oh
here we go look so here we go were first
to look which um well definitely
erroneous we've got a fringe bottom
dress which i think was like
and we've got third cool houndstooth
oversized men's looking blazer the heels
that are dukes of my own featuring you
know the price tags still on them and
there we go
first look by the way if you're
wondering why I'm filming in the
dressing room and because I forgot my
wallet at home
pretty really of the day all righty here
we go next look just like a little linen
wrap dress actually we have this jacket
it like kind of hopes because the
jackets sort of cute but yeah all righty
here we go next look boo okay so I'll be
honest they don't like all of it
but you know kind of cute this video
isn't really going according to plan
already the last look the pink wonder
later okay so really fit like that
product was going to fit this sweater
kind of makes me look like an
environmental snow person the jeans are
a very tight smooth and the shoes you
know the shoes are actually really cool
give these a 10 out of 10 overall I
would say yeah I don't really like this
look
hedaan oh my goodness look how much
cuter it looks with just my shorts oh
early-2000s fabulosity Oh God well this
isn't really going very well also it's
17 million degrees in here I tried in a
couple more things but the only thing I
finally found that was cute was this top
which turned out after checking the tag
was just misplaced and wasn't actually
hug clearance at all which you know was
just my luck for the day that was me
shopping in the clearance section I know
I know you guys that was like the worst
video ever I'm sorry are you even
allowed to fail at a video that much and
post it I don't know
well if you're not I just started a new
trend just so anyways if you're new to
my channel my videos aren't usually this
bad I mean like sometimes they're a
little bad but not usually like this bad
I usually try to make them good but
anyways I'm having enough
today clearly a quick note on that - I
get a lot of comments that are like your
life is so perfect and you're always so
happy and you're perfect and your videos
are perfect oh you guys I'm just like
you guys I get stressed and anxious and
you know life gets the best of me
sometimes too so a lot of you guys say
my videos cheer you up when you're
feeling down or help you when you're
feeling anxious and to be honest that's
what you guys do for me
so who especially when I myself I'm
having a little bit of an off day it
means a lot to me that I can film these
videos knowing that I might be helping
some of you guys out there so stay cheer
you guys spending on the love and even
though today's video was kind of a fail
it relates to one of my favorite life
lessons that I've ever learned which is
sometimes your best just isn't the best
and that's perfectly OK which is
basically just a way of saying give
yourself a break not everything has to
be perfect don't take life too seriously
as long as you're trying your hardest
and giving it your all
the end result doesn't really matter
it's all about the climb so there's my
quick little two cents on that but
anyway is back to my outro because I'm
rambling you're still watching me thanks
for watching if you're not subscribed I
promise the next video will actually be
a good video so stay tuned for that I
love you guys I'm gonna go pack my bags
and I will see you guys when I get back
so kiss us until next time my sweet
beautiful baby angels XL
I forget this isn't appropriate but wow
what a pop kirti you killed it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
