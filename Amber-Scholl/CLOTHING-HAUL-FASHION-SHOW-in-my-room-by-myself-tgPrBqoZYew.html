the mall we're going to do a haul I
literally can't think of anything
creative to do for a haul video intro
small tall Paul hellooo we're doing a
hoe
that was weird okay not that one yeah
oh-ho yeah we're doing a haul huh pretty
good I knew there was a pun in there
somewhere I'm not pretty babes and amber
and welcome back to my channel so today
since you guys asked me to do hauls I
thought why not
let's do a haul so today I'm teaming up
with one of my favorite little online
shopping sites white box boutique which
is a great little Australian retailer Oh
so major shadows white box boutique for
gifting me all the items to show you
guys today i'm responsibie bed so we're
going to try on all the stuff and show
you guys what I got all while trying
desperately to refrain from doing my
host really an accent solar hue dollar
whole time that was literally so bad
don't worry I'll spare you guys let's
just get to trying on the clothes
alright so we're going to kick off the
lookbook with my favorite aesthetic said
your métier in public okay here we go
you can see this is just like a little
set I got the little top and then I got
the matching shorts so cute you can wear
these to the gym even but you know not
going to wear them to the gym because
I'm only going to the gym and then I got
this matching duster which side slits
and back flips and front flips it's just
like basically one giant slit is this
even considered a duster with so many
what cement I don't know but anyways I
went ahead and busted out those pink
booties for next walk so this would also
totals you know quick sneakers because
as you can see it's kind of one of those
looks that can be either casual or a
little more dressed up and if you want
to know something funny about this
outfit this is so my aesthetic literally
I was in a bar the other day for my
friend's birthday and someone from high
school and I hadn't seen in like a
million years they came over and were
like I saw you walking by and I knew it
wasn't because of your outfit
alright this next look I personally
thought had totally like YSL equestrian
vibes what does that mean I don't know
but here we go the closer look at it
anyway it's a really
matching set it comes with pants or as a
skirt but I liked it in the skirt
version better you can see it has like
really nice gold buckle read details
which makes it look very low Georgia
paired it with my classic white pimp
daddy boots that I love so much and it's
just seriously so cute I'm like loving
this I think it comes in black too but I
liked white for spring you know ready to
go to the races I don't even have a
horse but if I did I'd probably wear
this there with a big hat tada
now that's more like it after the Grouch
but it's the whole version okay so this
is the next look I went ahead and took
the belt off that shirt is so funny I
was just saying like why would you ever
take the belt off and Here I am taking
the belt off so you live and you learn
all right so here we go these are like
some super cute pants look at these
they're like suede but they're all like
crisscross see leafy but it's like in
chunks so it's extra extra cool I went
ahead and paired it with some clear
heels because I wanted to really be able
to show off the pants and not have
anything distract from them I'm going to
go ahead and call this look sexy Oscar
the Grouch all right now I don't know
don't show me those mysteries Oscar the
Grouch can be sexy
what a horrible sentence anyways moving
along whoo workout stuff okay
so this is some super cute workout stuff
these actually are the literal exact
same pants that Kylie Jenner was wearing
in one of my most favorite photos of her
ever they're from dead sports which what
is that I don't know but so cute again
make your booty look great when I had a
pair done with my DIY crystalline many
teens that are still going strong not to
toot my own horn but uh not a single
crystal has fallen off yet dude dude you
want to see the little cosplay really
quick whoa surprise I got a stylist make
do but literally the exact same when she
was wearing that picture I don't know I
just thought it'd be fun at one point to
wear a lot of wigs which I did there was
a point where I literally wear this
every day but I don't do that anymore
but it's still fun to bust out every
once in a while so there we go oh my
gosh it's so weird I look like a cupcake
alright so here we go you can see this
looks fully head-to-toe but then the pan
we got this cool little course B top
looking thing
so fun I paired it with this super cute
white like Lisa skirt looks a lot like
those leggings that I'm obsessed with
the only thing is I got an extra small
and it's really tight on me
so definitely would recommend going
aside on that one and same for this but
this is a large so I'm going to match
the whole look I went ahead and paired
it with these cute little booties
because they match my top perfectly so I
guess we would call this hot mama on the
go I don't know I literally look like
I'm in a motorcycle game but okay so the
most glamorous motorcycle gang ever this
is their uniform so I am loving and this
jacket this is literally the same
leggings I was just wearing but I liked
them so much I got them in black too so
you can see literally exactly the same
and I went I'm going to paired it with
the cutest white motorcycle jacket I've
ever seen you can't really tell what
this is like literally is such high
quality oh my god I'm living it looks
just like the balm on jackets I'm loving
this
maybe I will join a motorcycle gang I'm
totally kidding I would be literally the
worst motorcycle gangster ever all right
so it's really funny about this outfit I
first of all love this because it looks
totally casual like you can see it's
just a cute little red pink cup with
some matching shorts very casual very
cute
I actually thought for a long time about
what the public sees and I couldn't come
up with anything I was like I'm wearing
sneakers I don't know but I personally
feel like wearing sneakers and a look
look is super boring so I went ahead and
making extra boom with some really wild
a thigh high and boot very Crocodile
Dundee inspired blue I love them and
what's great about the uses and the
thicker heels you could totally wear
them in the daytime and you can walk
around in these for hours and hours and
hours
also these shorts make your booty looks
so good so there's that added little
bonus there checked all the hot
Australian men even in America are there
any gear I don't know I've only met like
one and that date didn't go very well
but that's for a story time it was
probably hit something to do with the
fact that I kept imitating his accent
and doing it very badly
boom all right so this dress send the
look books meet again in case you
recognize this this is the same dress
that I was wearing in my extra lookbook
so shiny so sparkly so nice
just gotta wear it with some like
waist-high shorts obviously it's so cool
it is totally see-through but it is
awesome I love it like you can see whoo
please show it's super glamorous but
like so pretty on the fabric is just
amazing it like is really fun adds a
little bit of glamour so I know this
looks beautiful in photos you can see it
just looks like a liquidy metallic II
goddess dress up loved all right so here
we go now we've got this super cute
little grey um kind of sporty looking
look it's just like a super cute little
terry cloth kind of grey top with some
matching shorts in fact you guys
probably recognize this look because
this is literally exactly the same thing
that I was wearing my shopping blog the
other day except this is the gray
version like it literally feels like I'm
wearing pajamas I'm not so comfortable
I'm trying to come up with names for all
my looks but I don't even know what to
call this one dress pajama party
gum glamorous I don't know America
themed pajamas Oh 50 shades of grey
except silly one shade of grey so I
guess that doesn't work I don't know
whatever so there you go you can see the
white version so stinking cute I think
my camera is like hella extra
overexposed in the shot for some reason
because you can barely see me I'm like a
ghost blend in with the background hmm
this is like sexy tennis life golf caddy
look that's a good name for it totally
switching gears now from workout where
it's a formal wear a but again with the
Kardashian inspired stuff that totally
reminded me of that dress that Kim was
wearing when she and Kanye attended a
friend's wedding I thought it was super
cool and since I trust cause to cool 20
grams I thought this one was a steal
even though it's so still a little bit
pricy like you can see it's literally
just a v-neck dress with a cape
basically I'm in the backyard just kind
of like stick out the sides and even
though I have 18,000 ivv chokers I
couldn't help myself I got this one too
it literally looks identical to like
seven that I own but I love this one
it's so beautiful this one's like extra
high-quality too and it has 18 rows of
diamonds so it's a bird it's a plane
