Sanford welcome back to my channel so
today in case you can't tell my voice is
literally totally going away I found so
crazy like hair and sound like a weird
cross the old man so I'm sorry I wish I
had some really cool story like I was
out all night in a club and I met Harry
Styles we just had a wild evening
pouring and screaming and now that's not
what happened um at all I literally
think I was just filling too many videos
and talking to myself too much so on
that note I have literally 18 billion
shopping errands to run today so I
thought I would do like a little
shopping vlog and take you guys with me
on my tours are shopping around Los
Angeles so here we go a quick day in the
life of probably 12 hours straight
shopping featuring my crotchety old man
voice pin so this is what I'm going to
wear on today's shopping marathon cute
cozy and still a little flair of in
style
oh my god it is Wow well it's a
beautiful day in LA aside of the really
irritating honking and the traffic
people but ah what a glorious day to be
honest so we're going to walk la la la
la la whoo next stop I got to get some
like actually kind of boring things I
need like a towel and like stupid stuff
so we're going to go to my favorite
place t.j.maxx what new and pick up a
couple new things they want peas and
warm Peas I want everything to that I
don't need any of this I gotta focus
focus focus
oh my god this is literally so hard for
me not to get distracted in here but
like I said I need a towel so just go
get a towel I really wanted a black
towel but they don't have any water
oh that's a great towel will work
look at that you guys isn't it beautiful
look at it matches my ring perfectly and
I was so excited until I found out this
was five hundred dollars so that day I'm
not going to get this look at how pretty
look at me Oh such a tragic loss
goodbye little friends thank you anyways
desiring and what guys they have two
more of the same one I'm starving so
that I get these hmm
term update I think you've meant to me
alone as well there we go look at that
you guys I save $30 okay cool let's buy
the towels and get out of here we've got
to get some new face washes I always buy
all my face washers here because they're
so stinking cheap so let's see and maybe
just pink container so that's pretty me
and it says collagen I'm always looking
to look 12 years old so maybe those will
do oh I think I'll get a beauty blender
too because I'm too cheap to buy the
real ones these are like four dollars I
mean one of those mama my mom and dad
used to say this to me I love you to the
moon and back I love you guys pull it in
and back get some hangers because lord
knows I'm running out of space and click

we're having a minor dilemma see these
perks right here these are so stinking
cute
and the black one look at this the black
one is a $39 and this one that I like is
$98 so we're having a mental struggle
here whether I should buy this or not

outfit obviously but like oh it's just
like a little belt hanging so nice hmm

of downtown because I think I have like
five minutes look for a parking meter so

literally been shopping for so long the
Sun is literally setting but we got one
more stop to hit up still so here's a
nice aesthetically pleasing view and we
are on our way all right here we go the
last stop of the day my favorite the 99
only store I actually plan on doing like
a hundred million vlogs in here because
I love this place I'll show you like how
to shop it whatever but this is the bomb
if you've never been in the 99 cent
store you are missing one of the coolest
like this panel ah
like literally no joke you guys I love
the magnetic sensor I am here all the
time buying all sorts of nonsense like
giant bouncy ball 99-cent a random cat
food - $0.99 I don't even have a cat but
for 99 cents I'm going to get some so
cheap but today the best part about the
99 cent stores ah I'm gonna get her some
giant cool bones because it's my best
friend and roommate birthday and she
loves Barbie pink so I'm gonna put this
on her special mmm like being literally
is so much fun stuff in here I couldn't
live in the 99 cent store but since I'm
in a hurry because I gotta go watch back
for Monday I'm just gonna these things
up really quickly and head and it's
officially nighttime so I would say
that's a wrap I feel like sick oh oh
alright so there we go there's all my
loot um I am way too tired to unbox it
because at this point it's like 10
o'clock at night so I will add a little
haul in the morning all right here we go
much better the next morning I'm a
little more chipper so here we go just
gonna show you guys what I got so don't

kidding I'm going to open it okay so
let's see that's we'll start with the
black bag okay here what's in my little
trash bag oh yeah all the stuff I got my
little jewelry that I got downtown so I
got that really pretty diamond D bird
necklace that I'm obsessed with it
literally looks exactly like the one
that I'm wearing then I got this
matching little necklace because I'm
probably going to layer them so super
cute and then the matching earring these
were so cheap - this is like I think
total like $30 for all three
things and let's see what else did I get
yes we'll do the green bag what's in
here
oh the Adidas tracksuit things so that's
fun I got a silky black pants in the
silky black jacket so I can look just
like Miss Kimberly so this will be cute
I'll put this in a log at some point I
also got this really cool like Chanel
inspired belt thing so I'm loving it so

was $41 for both pieces so that was like
a steal and I'm actually gonna wear it
backwards so it's like a jacket so fun

Instagram soon um this would be a lot
easier to film if there wasn't like weed
whacking to the deaths going on outside

could you not rob I got these shorts
from Victoria's Secret that I literally
paid $7 for they were $45 but I got them
so cheap oh they look so weird like this

BCBG thing that I got oh yeah my little
octopus skirt so this is going to be so
fun this was like the big splurge item I
guess for $98 but it's so cool and they
said it was like really fancy faux
leather or something or ever so so
excited to wear this in the next extra
lookbook and of course my TJ Maxx haul
