look bald I thought this was gonna be a
good hairstyle for this but okay
apparently not anyways thank you so much
if we're literally a blowing up my
channel overnight I've been just sitting
in my bed crying and I can't believe it
and thank you thank you thank you thank
you oh my god
anyways huh so point it we are going to
film a new video today finally I'm going
to do one of my all-time favorite
activities which is trying on shoes so
we're going to do a designer dupe shoe
haul because if there's one thing I know
it's how to get cute shoes for less so
check it out
design a dupes shoe style alright so
we're going to start it out with these
one of my favorite pairs of shoes ever
these are the balm on Avila booties
they're so stinking cute
um look at these OMG they've been on
Miss Chloe
they've been on blac Chyna they've been
on nicki minaj they're so cute and now
they can be on you because they are
practically the identical shoe from Lola
Shoetique same exact suede same buckle
closures same style completely and these
are a whopping 30 $6.99 in one of my
favorite pairs of shoes in the history
of ever he's caged fishnet lookin
booties from Jimmy - I first saw them on
Kylie Jenner when she posted them and I
died I was like I need to own these but
of course um you can see the price tag
who has $2,000 so I made it a mission to
look for them I looked for bajillion
years until I finally found some but
tada
of course Lola Shoetique always comment
through for me I just adore these they
literally look like fishnet kind of
boots and I am obsessed with them right
so this is one of the hottest trends
right now is these soft boot things why
I don't know but you know what as
someone who's totally into it who needs
an explanation you don't need a reason
to want to look fabulous so yeah these
soft boots are 1260 dollars on Nordstrom
so yeah a total ripoff and they are
super cute though so first off this look
on Rihanna and this is one of those
looks that just shakes your life she is
just such
Wow girl crush anyways back to the sock
boots Tata
these are a basically exact dupe I'll
show you what they look like on because
it's kind of hard to see and granted I
did get the pink ones just because I
wanted to shake it up but they are
identical to the vet Amman brand like
they're so stinking cute alright up next
we have courtesy of good old affordable
Bergdorf Goodman the Valentino rock stud
leather pumps perhaps the most popular
celebrity shoe style ever who doesn't
have them everyone excellent anyways um
so yeah at Bergdorf Goodman these are
$1,000 995 I guess but check it out you
can get pretty much exact dupe for 30
bucks
all right these shoes are amazing brand
look at how cute these are they got the
clear thing that's like so damn trendy
right now and let's see well these are
out of stock because I beloved Kimberly
Kardashian was wearing them once so they
sold out like immediately but these are
$745 but these are an exact dupe
basically I got them in nude because I
prefer this color than black these were
oh I don't remember how much I think
they were like $32 I'm at Lola Shoetique
oh my god I love these shoes okay so for
this one we're gonna do a double whammy
because I liked them so much I had to
get them in like every color these are
just up he's a naughty if that's how you
pronounce it I really don't even know um
Lew Wallace shoes they were like two
grand so cute and then these are from
Ghana these are $900 so slightly cheaper
but both of them I have pretty direct
knockoffs both from Lola's Cape Robin is
actually the brand if you want to check
them out on Instagram they're super cool
and but these are like the fluffiest
little bedroom shoe that's kind of what
they reminded me of every time I wear
them so many men compliment me on them
it's almost creepy it kind of makes me
want to stop wearing them but not really
because I love them they're so fun um
pretty much direct dupes
I am efest love okay so this one's not
an exact dupe at all it's just a similar
style and I wouldn't have really even
put them in the video outside of the
fact that I'm obsessed with them and
they were thirteen dollars so they
needed to be featured but look how cute
these are oh ho I love them I got them
yesterday and when I was downtown
shopping I knew they were a knockoff of
some brands but I'm not sure which one
so I googled around this this was the
closest thing I could find but these are
$1,200 so I would say a pretty good dupe
for 13 bucks holy these are killed
$13 you guys $9 all right now this next
pair of boots I can't even find online I
don't know who the hell sells easy is
because the only place I can even find
them at all listed online is on eBay for
like 2 grand where are your shoes Kanye
where are they hiding it's ok not like I
would buy them anyway because I've
copied ears little babies these are Kim
K's custom and easy season to boots they
order the revolve party which is such a
look I just love this so simple cute
anyway this is not a love video about
Kim I'll make one of those another day
but um these boots are such a cute dupe
now I personally hate to say it but I
don't even like the easy ones that much
because I don't like the chunky heel I
just think that the dinner heel like is
kind of sexier and makes my legs look a
little better but these are fan tastic
i'll you've seen them featured in a
bunch of my other videos and I always
get so many questions about them they
are to die for
and not to mention super shape for boots
anyway this one is kind of random but I
felt like I could not just not share
this with you guys I wanted to get an
Adidas like all white superstar sneaker
for a while now but they're like 80
bucks which is totally I mean you could
get it it's definitely like more of a
splurge item to me anyways um but I
definitely wanted to get the look and I
found these when I was downtown shopping
at Lola's yesterday for $6.99 so
definitely not an exact duplicate super
close you can totally still get the look
and for $7 compared to $80 I'll take it
alright last pair of shoes we're going
to do are these so basic but so cute
classic little Tom Ford and sandals
every celebrity known to mankind has
this pair of shoes which is why I got
them myself I'd actually mentioned in a
different video that I got these at
Lola's but I was mistaken these are
actually kind of old but you can see I
got them had forever 21 for like $30
they do have similar pairs at Lola's
still so I'll loot link you to those but
these are just so cute so simple and
look great with just about well loops
but they do look great with just about
anything so they have you guys those are
my top picks for the best designer dupes
2016 if you have any questions comments
concerns as always hit me up in the
comment section below
I really do try to answer all of them
but
in the last few days like I literally
sat on the computer for over like ten
hours it's so embarrassing I just sit
home and I still couldn't get to them
all
so I'm trying though I am if you want
more of an immediate response snapchat

in there yet but anyways as always all
my socials are at amber shoal

means to me
