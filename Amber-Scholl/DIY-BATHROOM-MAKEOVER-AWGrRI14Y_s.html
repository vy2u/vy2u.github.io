amber the fuzzy bunny today course it's
a faux fur bunny you guys know that but
you know still can be cute feeling today
I'm gonna go ahead into a quick little
video for you guys I have finally
finished decorating my bathroom so I
thought it would be fun to go ahead and
show you guys all my little tips and
tricks to making it look fabulous both
on a budget and just you know ballin Oh
so without further ado here we go a DIY
very extra bathroom makeover
all right so first I'm gonna show you my
bathroom before by the way I filmed this
part a couple days ago so pardon the
blonde hair and the totally different
outfit but here's the before alright so
here's my bathroom before you can see um
very just kind of nothing going on just
super plain there's nothing on the walls
nothing on the counter is nothing really
anywhere so I just haven't decorated it
at all so you can see here it is and
we're gonna go ahead and do a couple DIY
projects and give it a little makeover
alrighty
are you guys ready to see the finished
product mmm great said uncertain here's
my new and improved bat you can see it
finally decorated by the way this is my
outfit of the day which I didn't show
you oh so cute you know you got like the
black tights and the fuzzy sweater with
the fuzzy hat I actually made this but
I'll explain that in other videos so
here we go you can see one of the first
things that I did when I moved in here
this is the sink it's just plain a
silver you know you can see it was like
that
and I've actually seen on tumblr a
couple days before a beautiful golden
sink that had like wings and a bird head
and I was just dying and I totally
wanted it but it was like five hundred
dollars so I didn't buy it so I went
ahead and did the little bitch version
and I bought some winged book ends and I
just went ahead and kind of slid them in
you can still use the think of mine
turns forward so that's lucky but yeah
you can see it kind of created the same
illusion especially when you're standing
back like you know you would never
really know so that was fun gave you the
look without the high price the pair of
these was 40 bucks so super cool I
actually went ahead and put those in
every bathroom in my house like you can
see I also put them here um why I have
two sinks like I said I don't really
know but I do so here's my other vanity
sink so you can see it looks super fun
really just adds like some Flair um of
course I've got you know self promo my
jewelry line right there and then this
was something you guys asked a lot about
on Instagram I'm literally obsessed with
those super expensive flower
arrangements that are like $500 for the
little tiny container I actually did a
DIY of them a while ago so I went ahead
and did kind of an updated version with
these you can see these are actually
real preserved roses which look freakin
beautiful in this case
hater this was another super quick easy
DIY you just bought these little
preserved Rose heads on Amazon they're
golden and really cool
they were only 28 bucks - for the
package so pretty affordable for what
they are coz the live forever so you can
see I had the pile of rose heads right
here and then I just go ahead stick them
in the jar until they all look fabulous
all set around oh look at that beautiful
I went ahead and stuck one in the bottom
there two for fun and voila they look so
good pin see I doubled it so there one
on each side to kind of give it like a
fancy illusion so totally I feel like if
I can get the flowers on Amazon and make
your own so it's super fun I'm gonna
probably decorate it like my whole house
and roses so anyways back to the main
bathroom you can see like I said I've
also got the flower arrangement over
there then it literally took me so long
to decide what kind of soap containers
and stuff that I wanted so I ended up
getting vintage gold theme so I actually
ended up at getting all of the decor
like this little thing the soap
container my tissue container all on
Etsy like this is vintage from the 1950s
how cool is that and it was only $20 so
a steal and super cool I would I hadn't
got a matching soap container which
actually isn't even a soap container it
was meant for hair spray but I bought
this other soap container instead so it
would match kind of the essence got a
fun little decor tray - which was also
pretty cheap I think this was like 30
bucks so super super fun you can see
yourself in there too like this is not
flattering okay anyways also I'm lucky
enough to have real marble in my sink
now but if you're not you can check out
my video on doing your own marble
countertops and of course the video that
started at all the marble floors which
I'm also blessed enough to have now
which is such a dream but if you don't
you can totally steal the look of real
marble floors but the video that started
my youtube career DIY marble floors
super easy and will totally transform
your space so make sure you check those
out that's a really easy way to do it I
love this floor so much I'm willing to
lay on my bathroom for this that's
dedication and the kind of disgusting so
I'm going to get it now but moving along
to this area um you can see I'm not
actually a hundred fifty percent done
with this but we'll go ahead and start
with the Shelf I actually bought this
shelf with it was silver I found it at
home good
for like $30 and it would be fun and
easy to make it gold so I went ahead and
just bought some gold spray paint laid
it down sprayed it overnight and voila
boom you got a gold shelf never be
afraid to buy things and kind of make
them your own painting stuff is easy I
buy stuff in the wrong color good tip
good coming down from the Shelf again I
was just like I don't know what you're
supposed to put on top of the toilet I
put this perfume box there for now I'm
gonna change it if you have any ideas
let me know I thought it would be fun I
am so basic I think these fuzzy things
are like sofa and my mom says they're
tacky but I love them it gives you a
toilet a little more zest in life so
fabulous I don't know why I'm pointing
with my foot but who cares I guess from
that we move along to the towels which I
guess I have quite a bit to say about
these actually towel rack was actually
white but I thought it was really ugly
so I went ahead and switched it out I
got this cool towel rack on Amazon I'm
for thirty bucks just went ahead and
replaced it though it's so much more
beautiful um I need to fill in the holes
I haven't haven't done that yet but I
will but you can see the gold towel rack
just makes it so much fancier and
prettier I did the same thing with the
white toilet paper holder I went ahead
and got a matching gold one this one's
just so good and fun I shop for exciting
towels for a long time checked online
couldn't find anything that I really
thought was super fun so I actually went
ahead and made my own towels super easy
super cheap and you can decorate them
any way you want so here's how I did
that so these were actually just plain
black towels that I went ahead and put
gold trim and fringe on to make them
more exciting what you can see was a
super easy project I just took two basic
towels then some fringe and some little
gold foil used my trusty e6000 glue to
glue them on design them yourself
however you want there's really no rules
here let them dry in voila look at that
perfectly glamorous fabulous extra
towels
so now they look super cute like fancy
hotel towels Oh glam and fabulous got a
bathmat cuz you need a bath mat here's
my shower I didn't really do too much in
here cuz like how do you decorate a
shower but I did go ahead and buy am I
do not know what you call this oh my god
a shower rack okay so I bought a shower
rack so I went ahead and hung a shower
rack over my little faucet head thing so
we've got my shampoo conditioner so I
bought one of those like shower squeegee
things cuz I just love squeegee with
shower a loofah of course got my 99-cent
rays are super cool so there we go
that's really all I did to the shower
because I mean what else can you really
do to a shower so that's that I also
went ahead and organized my drawers
which is something I've like never done
in my life but my mom would be so proud
of me so I'm gonna show it off because
she watches my videos hi mom love you
okay
so you ready to be proud mama okay so
it's all kind of looks like a mess but I
bought these super cool little drawer
organizer thingies from Bed Bath &amp;amp;
Beyond they're just like little
containers that you can kind of make fit
in the drawer so it is organized so you
can see I just like put different sizes
in there now everything has a
compartment which would you know be a
lot better if I actually use the
compartments but you know I'm trying
moving on to this area so again I just
love mirrors I think they're so fun and
really open up a space so even though I
have a literally giant mirror right here
I thought it would be fun to put in a
better ear so I actually had this from
my old apartment so I just went ahead
and hung it right there above the
bathtub because I felt like it needed a
little bit of spice hose the more DIY
towels out in the front of it and this
is actually super funny I don't know
what this is but I thought it was really
ugly so I went ahead and bought like
another antique thingy and just you know
I'm covering it because that looks
better a candle so it smells good and
voila and there you go kids
that is my finished bathroom too and
that is the end of that there you have
you guys left is my DIY bathroom
makeover / tours / I know it's not like
officially actually a hundred percent
done yet but

ideas go ahead and let me know in the
comments I'm totally open to suggestions

apartment tour as soon as I have more
things in my house than a mirror and a
big empty wall so so make sure you stay
