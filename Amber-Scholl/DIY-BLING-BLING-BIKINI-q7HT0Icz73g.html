totally getting I'm clearly not on
vacation in fact I'm not even outside
I'm literally laying on a blanket in my
house underneath a fluorescent lamp
because it's actually weirdly really
cloudy in LA right now like look at this
it's ugly like you can't really tell but
I swear it's cold anyways not important
what's up guys it's amber and welcome
back to my channel and if you're new
hello welcome to my floors so today I
thought it would be fun since so many of
you guys DM me and asked me about those
sparkly fabulous bikinis that you see on
Instagram and Twitter I thought it would
be fun to go ahead and make my own
because the original ones are hella
overpriced and I figured I could make
one for half the money and twice as cute
so today I'm going to show you guys how
I made my very own DIY vajazzling
swimsuit pardon the mess but you know
that's what you get when you're laying
on your dirty floor anyways here we go
oh well guys it's been a minute since
we've done a midnight DUI why so here
we're doing it
and I'm also trying to be a little quiet
because I remember sleeping cell here we
go this is what you're going to need for
this project obviously we're going to
need a swimsuit this is just a plain
black swimsuit string bikini is what I
have picked because that is my favorite
and of course we're going to need some
sparkly bling bling bling
oh yeah it's hard to in no sunlight just
haven't quite sparkle like I usually
like it too but you can see these are
just crystal appliques I got these
downtown Los Angeles but you can also
pick these up on Etsy or Amazon and
linked down below we're also going to
need a girl legal and thread so that is
what we're going to need for this
project
alright so I'm going to go ahead and
start with the top and basically all I'm
going to do is you can do whatever you
want I'm just going to take the gold
appliques I have a couple of these so
I'm going to see what I want to do here
I think I'm going to just put them on
top like this get another one and put it
right there and I think that's all I'm
going to do to the top so here's how I'm
going to attach that alright well I just
realized this was going to be impossible
to film but this is invisible thread and
so I'm going to go ahead and thread the
invisible thread through a needle I will
try to show that right now but obviously
it's invisible so very very difficult I
also went ahead and tied a knot at the
end of it just so I could get to sewing
but all you want to do is go ahead and
south piece on to the swimsuit over
under over under until it is all
attached
make sure you do both sides obviously
just so it's even and fabulous already
need some help at the top is finished
we're going to go ahead and do the
bottom now I wanted the bottoms to be
super duper duper extra so I got this
giant applique sing and I'm basically
just going to put dazzle the entire
crotch area like this so same thing just
sew it right on there also as an added
bonus on the back I know I know the back
in the front of the bottoms will kind of
the same size but I like them to be kind
of like skimpy so I'm going to go ahead
and sew this one on so ferry back as
well just for a little extra extra nice
so go ahead just sew those pieces on by
the way it's morning now because I fell
asleep like while I was sewing it
yesterday so no it is a cool 9 a.m. just
you know to explain the light difference
alrighty there we go now that it is all
sewed on on the front and also on the
back tada hey I'm going to go ahead and
try it on show you the finished product
okay here is the finished look it came
out literally so cute and you can see
the top is a killer I'm not going to lie
it doesn't fit me that great but you
know that's not my fault
I'll show you the back here but it's a
lot so I'm going to cut it off a little
bit but you can see whew
so cute and this is cute and the whole
thing is just darling so ready to go to
the beach or probably not I don't really
want to get this wet but ready to take
an Instagram the so there you have it
you guys that is how I made my very own
but does leave swimsuit as always if you
have any questions comments concerns all
my socials or at universals you can hit
me up on bear I hope you guys enjoy and
have a fabulous time at wherever you're
going be at the beach or just your own
pool or literally nowhere at all your
floor you know hey whatever floats your
pants by the way guys I do not want to
read a single comment that says anything
like I wish I could wear this but like
my body isn't in good shape enough no no
no no glitters make anyone fabulous so
wear whatever you want to wear you guys
everybody is beach body ready okay okay
on that note I love you guys so very
much I will see you super soon kisses
