my hair in a braid today I don't know
why I'm holding it like this but I
really wanted you to see it apparently
but anyways what up you guys it's amber
welcome back to my channel and welcome
to my house so you guys can probably
tell by my lack of preparation in outfit
and also time of day this video wasn't
exactly planned but I randomly decided
that I was gonna film this so I'm
filming it I have absolutely obsessed
with French architecture
I love the Palace of Versailles and all
the Parisian buildings and especially
after I saw the photos at the Met Gala
this year I just decided but um I had to
live there myself and since obviously I
cannot live there in real life I thought
I would go ahead and you know bring it
to me so tonight I'm just gonna do a
quick little video showing you guys how
I'm turning my house into a French
Parisian Palace style of course
okay so usually when I start these
videos I'll do an outfit of the day but
since like I said I didn't really plan
this video um I am literally wearing a
nude sports bra and a headband and
that's literally it
just kidding I like sweatpants too
because I mean obviously I wouldn't just
walk around my house naked while I know
I'm on camera no I do do that you know
off camera but um hey that's my really
boring outfit of the day let's get back
to our construction so I felt myself at
Lowe's earlier because whenever I do a
project I always found myself shopping
for it just in case so here we go uh
here's me at Lowe's shopping earlier
today blind you with the ice okay all
right so we're at Lowe's and uh we'll
see what we're gonna get we need to get
some things to fix the things on to the
wall so uh keep bringing go to the
hardware section well would you look at
that here we are
Oh God so many options what do I want
we're gonna go with these I don't really
know if these are gonna work but let's
hope for the best here so alrighty grab
well all of them I'm buying a ladder too
so I needed some assistance I think I
actually have two over in that home
which is even worse but anyway so we got
so all the goods and I'll see you back
at home whoa all right so here's all the
things that we got uh we'll see if it
works we did a kid so alrighty
fantastic so you're probably wondering
what the heck were actually even
sticking on the walls so here's a
flashback from a couple days ago when I
went to the coolest store ever oh my
gosh look at this place
oh I can't breathe I literally was
beyond shook in here this is amazing oh
my god we are in the coolest place I
think I've ever been and I've been some
cool places whoa look oh the options oh
my god
already we got the bucks the goodies
let's go oh my god
this is my house now wonder if they'd be
mad if I lived him here already so
here's what we're going to use for this
project you can see okay so these are
called appliques and onlays well we're
back do you get these well let me tell
you it took me about a year of googling
to figure out what the heck they were
but kind of like crown molding you can
get them on what any like architectural
design website so I've got a bunch of
these you can see tada
this is already painted gold you can see
it's kind of made of like a weird
plastic material so here we go I got
that and then I got some other pieces
this is another one of the ones that I
got you can see they kind of just come
in like literally a bunch of different
pieces so there we go you can kind of
like make them be whatever design you
want to be so we'll screw around with
that in a second
in addition to the gold ones I also got
some white ones because I didn't want
like my whole house to be gold well I
mean I did but even I know making
everything gold is a bad idea so we got
some white ones too again not really
sure we're gonna do with them but we'll
play with those in a minute and then of
course from good ol Lowe's I got some
command strips and some clear mounting
tape um I don't really know if these are
going to work but hopefully they do
because it's late and I don't want to go
out again so that's basically all we got
for this project and uh we're gonna get
started okay so I'm not showing you my
whole house because it's still not done
yet obviously but this is the wall that
we're going to get started with you can
see it's beautiful but no they plane
which you know y'all know plane is not
my aesthetic at all so we're gonna go
ahead and get started with this one so
first thing I'm just gonna lay them out
and you can see I got one two three of
those so I just laid them all next to
each other so they kind of connect and
then to these I have one over here and
then one over here and that's gonna kind
of be the design and I'm just gonna go
ahead and put them up there so to do
that I'm just gonna go ahead and whip
out the command strips go ahead and peel
the backs off of those like so and then
I'm just gonna go ahead and stick them
on the back of the applique kind of like
double sided tape go ahead and peel the
other side of the command strip off and
but oh it's ready to go on the wall oh
yeah uh I also got a ladder because
I'm short y'all always ask why I wear
heels all the time it's because I'm only
5 3 and I need the extra inches where I
can get them selves anyways uh yeah I'm
starting this video for long enough so
we're actually just gonna get started
now okay see if I was literally so
afraid that I was gonna fall off the
header and break my legs doing this but
good news obviously that didn't happen
so anywho they are you got to do it go
ahead and just stick that right on to
the wall boop boop boop
perfecto and there we go we're done just
kidding but uh we do got one so now we
just got full the rest to go then you
can just do the same thing with the
other pieces press them on the wall one
by one until ah oh my goodness it looks
so beautiful
Wow that was easier than I thought
all right on to the next so for the next
wall you can see this one is also really
really plain I'm gonna go ahead and do
this one all in white kind of similar to
this photograph so you can see the
before right here basically all we're
gonna do is um actually literally the
same thing so what about the white
moldings from before same thing put the
command strips all over the back of them
like a crazy person the more command
strips the merrier and then we're just
gonna go ahead and stick them right onto
the wall boop boop boop stick stick
stick all over the place until you kind
of get any sort of design going by the
way fun tip if you know how to use
Photoshop that's a great way to kind of
mock up things that you're doing before
you do them in your house like you can
see I kind of did that here it's not
even close to perfect but you know just
to get the generic idea one by one two
by two the appliques go on the wall
hurrah hurrah great that's definitely
not the song but it's fine well okay so
I would say tada but actually I misread
the measurements on these completely so
I need to order like a whole nother box
with them to actually finish this but
you get the idea
Wow look how beautiful I'd say mission
accomplished
so maybe you guys - oh I did my little
Versailles castle decoration in my
apartment I hope you guys enjoyed the
video because well like I said it was an
afterthought I just figured you guys
would ask about it and I also of course
wanted to give you guys a sneak peek of
my apartment even though it's totally
not done yet but as you can see it's
taking me a long time because I'm
getting a very specific aesthetic in
here so stay tuned I promise the
apartment tour is coming and when it
comes it will be well worth the wait
so on that note that you can tell I'm
literally like so heading hot in here
maybe it's the fact that I'm wearing
sweatpants but I would say that was um
in a weird way sort of hard work grab
the brain one more time just for old
times sake I love you guys kisses till
next time my sweet beautiful princess
castle baby angels XO
always make my life look so glamorous
online but you know what it's really
like me wearing a blanket as a dress in
my unfinished castle these crafts make
such a mess I'll figure out what I'm
doing with the rest of this soon but for
now even when everything's a mess you
can't forget you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
