gosh so luxurious I love it alright
what's up guys it's amber and welcome
back to my channel so today um can you
guess what we're gonna do content that's
right we're going camping
if not I'm totally kidding today I'm
going to show you how I make my own
chokers because it is so is so easy and
I get so many questions about it um I
thought you know what this is the
perfect time to show you guys how to
look glam as hell on a hella budget so
here we go do-it-yourself Diamond
chokers and other chokers but you know
and I really need a couple things from
this project it's really easy these are
actually lace trims that I got from
downtown Los Angeles in the fashion
district but you can get them anywhere
of Joanne's I mean like craft store that
sells fabric same goes for this this is
actually a little different I'll explain
this later but yeah just go to a craft
store pick up some things that you think
would look nicer on your neck and those
will be the base for your chokers okay
the next thing you need is I don't even
know what these are officially called
but I think I asked for jewelry clasps
and this is what the lady showed me
you'll recognize these from your regular
jewelry and they are just what will make
the chokers stay fastened around your
neck last but not least you need a
hammer and some giant scissors
I am totally kidding no the only tools
that you need for this is a pair of
tweezers with a flat end and a little
safety pin this is a bigger one you'll
see why in a second so here we go
let's get started okay so we'll start
out with the black one because that one
is super easy actually I mean they're
all really easy but we're just gonna
start with this one so as you can see
here um these are the little closures
that we're going to use this is what it
looks like and you can tell right there
there's a little split in it which is
just how easy it is I have really long
nails so I can just bend it it's really
malleable so you can just kind of pop
that open like this a little bit and
there you go as you can see there's a
little tiny indentation in it now you
could slip your fingernail through it
and that is how we're going to slip it
onto the fabric so once you got those
busted open bring that through the
center there like this at all and there
you go perfect okay so here we go we'll
take the little black piece of fabric
now and onto one edge of it take the
little guy that you just did now this
one's easy when it's lace because it
already has like pre done holes so you
don't have to do any like poking or
anything it's all you ought to do is
take it and loop it through where the
opening is like that tada pull it
through and then you'll just clamp it
closed with the tweezers so that way it
stays and you're good to go and then
literally just take the other side put
it through bumbum and great now just
close that one up to again using the
tweezers
and you're good to go and there you go
it's literally done now all you have to
do is treat it like any other necklace
you can just pop open the little clamp
attach it to the other side like so and
bam you are ready to wear it come on
then you can just repeat the process for
anything else you want to do for this
one the only other tip that would be
different is as you can see this one
doesn't have already pre-done holes like
the other ones because where you will
take the safety pin and you can just
poke one real quick loop through the
side and you can just slip the ring
through that hole just like you did the
other ones
my special chokers actually started when
I saw them on obviously of course my
beloved Kimberly um but these chokers
for fake diamond chokers mind you that I
saw Annette tagged on Instagram $825
$400 like why is this $400 I mean it's
pretty but like is that that necessary I
feel like no especially when you can get
the same thing for like 20 bucks so this
is how I do my own Diamond chokers okay
so this is actually um an iron-on piece
of fabric check this out I got it in
downtown LA in the fabric district which
is super fun if you ever get a chance to
go totally do but this is $19 it was
actually meant for ironing on two
wedding gowns designers and stuff buy
them for lots of different things but I
bought it because I'm going to turn it
into a choker so this is how I'll do
that no surprise here I do the same
thing I do with the other one it's like
a thin little like I said it's for
ironing on stuff so it's super easy to
puncture so I will just take my little
safety pin and then poke a hole through
right at the edge here Boop and it'll
just go right through like that tada woo
I feel like a doctor there you go you
can't really see it but there's a little
hole there and that is where I will slip
the little this thing through so here we
go alright so there you go you can see I
will just slip that right through the
little hole I made tall and close it up
just like it did the other ones and tada
you can just link it together just like
you would any other choker and boom look
at that fire fire fire fire okay so this
one is really so easy do you have zero
assembly required
grab a suede string like I said um this
was from you get this jo-ann's for like
three cents I think but then you can
literally just tie it around your neck
and call it a choker check it out okay
so this last tip isn't the classiest
thing I've ever done but you guys asked
so this is what I do I wear a lot of
makeup so I just have trouble wearing
white chokers because they always get
Brown after I've worn them so I decided
to instead make my own reusable or
disposable chokers by buying a big spool
of ribbon and then I will just trim it
into a little you know a map that would
cover my neck and then I will just loop
it around mine
back and bada-bing bada-boom it's a
choker then when um then after I wearing
it once dope I'll just pull it off and
toss it and the next time I'll just do
the whole thing over again fake it till
you make it ladies so there you have it
you guys that is how I make my own
chokers I hope you enjoyed the quick
little tutorial if you have any
questions comments concerns of course
