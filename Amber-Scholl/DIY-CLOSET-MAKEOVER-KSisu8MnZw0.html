to do it can you believe that by the way
May 1st 2018 what the heck time is
flying I swear to do that song just came
out like two days ago how crazy is that
we're really getting old totally kidding
me young sexy fabulous and beautiful
anyways what is up you guys
it's amber welcome back to my channel
and today we're doing something Betty
Betty exciting so today I thought it
would be fun to go ahead and do a little
construction project because my
beautiful friend Queenie who you
recognize real quite a few videos just
moved into a new place and needs a
little help with her closet so I figured
we would go ahead and see what kind of
fabulosity as we can deliver to give her
closet a whole new look
so without further ado here we go DIY
closet makeover Brooklyn style
okay so before we get going usually I
would show my outfit of the day but
honestly I'm going through a phase where
I like to hate all of my clothing so
this is over wearing a big oversized
sweater jean shorts and some kicks and
that's it I'm literally gonna buy a
whole new wardrobe like next week but
for now this is what we're wearing
because we're gonna get really dirty and
IKEA anyway so since my have been so
boring I'll give you a sneak preview of
another little mirror setup I have in my
house and Mees oh my gosh you guys are
gonna die over the house to her but I'll
do that when it's done it's not done yet
so for now whatever
um but ho to Quinn's house okay that's
my workout of the day look at that I
didn't even plan this I did not text her
and tell her this is the beautiful Quinn
hi you guys before I've been in multiple
videos yeah we are in her bedroom now No
oh here we go and though this is the
first look at the closet so did I die
before no it's my decide it's only
almost 2 million people watching it's
fine alrighty here we go so this is the
closet before you know what you actually
have a lot of room in here we're gonna
make this fabulous a challenge but it's
gonna be really fun too so first thing
we're gonna do is clean it which is
something we're both not very good at I
know right here alright let's do it so
we just went ahead and cleaned it and I
cleaned it I mean we just threw
everything on her bedroom floor instead
of the closet so we'll clean that later
but for now that's fine ok we officially
gutted the whole thing honestly Bing in
here I think we can do great things so
uh let's see what we can do actually how
are we gonna even get out of here here
we go
let's get away alrighty dad done son
time we just got to get to the closet
section though I couldn't honestly live
in Ikea
it's so fun in here but ok class
McGinnis look at all the different
Shelby options oh I don't care if these
are for the kitchen these could be cool
oh we got it all right so I think we've
officially got everything so we're gonna
rig it up go home and see what kind of
construction we can do alrighty next
stop is Lowe's I don't really know what
we need in here but I like Lowe's so
we'll see all righty here we go the DI
wires Joey we're gonna get this marble
contact paper so we grabbed that skipped
ILO's and got started on our project so
you can see here this was the closet
before like you saw we completely gutted
it and the first thing we decided to do
was hang some shelves on the left walls
you can see we got these little hanging
and Fendi shelves from Ikea which a hug
me forever to figure out how to hang up
but eventually we figured it out it
actually wasn't that hard at all so we
have two of those they looked fabulous
then we're gonna go ahead and decorate
the back wall and make it kind of like a
splash accent wall with the marble
contact paper so you can see we're just
gonna put it all over the wall in order
to do that you can see it just lets peel
and stick literally you can just stick
this straight on to the wall it's like a
sticker so we just went ahead and rolled
it out and plopped it all up onto the
wall did it add layers until we covered
the whole thing wow it looks so good
mission accomplished ladies mission
accomplished then we went ahead and
scooted in this little shoe rack lookin
thing I think it's actually immensely a
TV stands but we're gonna use it as a
shoe rack so then it was time to hang
the mirror hello so we are going to put
it right there the directions to hang
this simple little mirror where it's so
confusing oh my god it took us like a
full hour to hang up me first anyway so
we also had the great idea to just go
ahead and take the door off of its
hinges and completely remove it so we
did no weave that easy to just get rid
of your door you literally just unscrew
it and uh it's gone so now we have an
open door frame and we're gonna hang
curtains so all we did for that was take
a tension rod then some pretty fluffy
curtain thingies you can see oh they're
so nice like getting there
here comes the bride that set it up just
kidding okay so okay you just go ahead
and pop those on the tension rod and
then you can just plop the tension rod
right up easy peasy lemon squeezy
hi good I just gives it a really cool
dramatic effect it makes it a lot more
clamp then comes the smoke I don't know
that's just the name of the chandelier
that we bought so what's funny about
this is actually uh huh we're not gonna
hang it in the actual light section
we're going to go ahead and cheat it and
hang it in the middle so we just took
some hooks that you can just twirl right
into the ceiling and hook them on to the
chandelier like so the hump of
chandelier on it it properly completely
and there you go completely fake
chandelier but it looks great for the
gram and that's all that matters right
to show for a second we're gonna go
ahead and take these other infinity
shelves and put them on the bottom rack
here to hold shoes or purses or whatever
so we just took the drill
Merve I'm Karthik and then screwed those
right into the wall which are actually
pretty easy to hang once you get the
hang of it haha the hang of it get it a
bun Oh beautiful look at that since the
shelves are right above those we're
gonna go ahead and hang these little
picture frames which are so fun so we
just took these little picture frames
and hung them through some of Quinn's
favorite pictures in there and they
became like a little Instagram art
gallery so if it's what I left to go to
bed but don't worry I came back the next
day bright gnarly by the way it's a
different day now because uh we were too
tired to finish that yesterday so we're
gonna finish it today so underneath this
mirror we're gonna hang this jewelry
thing so the first thing we did was hang
a little jewelry container for you know
jewelry throw up some little hooks on
the wall to hang some hats and then
we're gonna go ahead and make a rug so
we just bought a big white piece of
fabric downtown and then we just went
ahead and cut it to shape so it was a
little square rug so so so fabulous we
absolutely slayed it and with that the
construction part of the project was
done so you can see here it's all empty
but we finished the inside oh my gosh it
looks a SOHO pretty thing kind of a
party in here party with Cody buddy it
Cuddy in the robbery okay Wow I can't
wait to decorate it so here comes the
fun part
decorating bring in the shoes Quinn
perfect all right guys are you ready to
see closet literally I am so excited for
you guys to see this you're not even
gonna believe it I am like so Chuck oh
you guys saw the before drumroll please
Quinn oh god you can see the finished
product is so so beautiful it came out
even better than we thought it was going
to come out honestly not to toot our own
horn or anything but to I'm so proud of
us okay so a little bit more of an
in-depth Stewart here we go you can see
of course when you walk right in the
beautiful curtains of course the
chandelier on the ceiling which is just
really adds to everything of course we
have the shoes perfectly organized and
you know of course the clothes on top
perfectly organized to
color-coordinating and all matching
hangers is my favorite way to hang
anything of course we got clothes folded
at the top too for storage the trunk the
purse some pretty flowers just to add oh
and the marble wall in the backdrop
looks so good we've got the two bottom
shelves with some super cool shoes on
those as well and of course the big
shelves we put all sorts of
aesthetically pleasing things on those
we've got Quinn's favorite perfumes we
got her handbags we got all her jewelry
we got the little potted plants that we
put here to kind of look good for
selfies like you've Quinn was taking a
selfie you see oh look at that so cute
of course we got more clothes stored
underneath the shoes on the shelf there
we've got all the jewelry laying out on
display on little marble trays all the
pictures which just make it really homey
and personalized the rug on the floor
the adorable jewelry container which we
also have in put jewelry in yet and that
my friends is how you turn a drab closet
into a fab closet honestly do I want to
