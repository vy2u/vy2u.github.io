welcome back to my channel it's the
first video of 2017 so I thought we
would really kick it off right with a
cool DIY featuring of course my favorite
thing crowns so today I'm gonna show you
guys how to make one of my most
requested DIYs ever which is those crown
headphones that Rihanna was sporting in
the selfie that shook the nation and me
my god I stared at that selfie for like
30 minutes what you first posted it so
today I'm going to show you how to make
your own because the original ones that
RiRi is wearing cost of cool $7000
courtesy of Dolce and Gabanna so I'm
going to show you guys how to make your
own that look just as just as fabulous
so here we go DIY crown headphones I
shouldn't really start a series called
midnight DIYs but anyways alright here
we go so what you're going to need for
this project is well stuff you would
think you would need so we're going to
need a pair of headphones um with a thin
band you can get these on Amazon for
like $20 30 bucks so this is what you're
going to need there um then get some
little like craft bead things I don't
even know what these are really but I
found them downtown super cool so I'm
gonna use those for decorative purposes
gonna get some chain chains got man
chains all right Nick Jonas crystal
chains yes I'm gonna need some more like
little sparkly beads good old trusty
e6000 glue to glue everything together
and of course what would a crown
headphone DIY be without a crown so pick
up a crown I got this again downtown for
like I think I paid 15 bucks for this so
that is what you will need oh except one
more thing of course it wouldn't be a
neighbor show of DIY if I didn't tell
you to pull out some tweezers so ooh
look at how gold everything is anyways
that's needed for this project so let's
get started
alrighty so what I'm gonna do first is
go ahead and glue this on to the
beautiful headphone so I'm just gonna go
ahead and take the glue um yeah I'm
using the other end of it cuz this is my
old one I'm trying to get rid of it um
but still turned you know save it get
the best out of it alright so just gonna
go ahead and doll at that again just
like you would glue anything on to
anything
just kind of go ahead stick that on
there nothing too crazy you guys tada
looking great already
all right side note I don't know why but
I just realized that my aren't
detachable so I guess that's what you
get for like seven dollar headphones
anyways so I'm going to go in and
continue decorating them all
disconnected here because I think
that'll be a little easier so next I'm
going to take the little chain because I
don't like personally the little silver
line that's on this I think it would
look better gold because you know my
crown is gold and like the whole
aesthetic is gold so I'm just gonna go
ahead and take this and put glue on
there all the way around like so try not
to get it too too messy um and then you
would just go ahead and lay the little
chain on top of it so like this blue
they look like little Easter Egg pods or
some something okay so we're just gonna
let those dry for a little bit
hahaha actually Who am I getting we're
not gonna let them dry we're going to go
ahead and bedazzle them even more if you
just have to take the glue go ahead and
put that on the back of there and then
we can just go ahead and stick that
right on to the little flowery decal
thing guys see that there we go
all righty there we go I've officially
bedazzled them to death um yes look at
that goal Emma so I'm just gonna let
these dry overnight and I will get back
to them in the morning by the way a
quick update on trying to attach the
crown to the little headband thing
really hard you can glue it that way but
then I was thinking for storage like how
are you ever gonna have it like doing
anything so I personally I'm gonna keep
the crown detached and just wear it as
the same time as I'm wearing a bedazzled
headphones um so it's your call but I
personally I'm gonna leave it like that
okay see in the morning so there you go
you guys this is what the finished
product is going to look like you can
see I went ahead and reattached the
little head pods or whatever the hell
these are to the little thing and they
look so good like Wow oh it looks
amazing
I love it so you can just go ahead and
put it on your head and go slay today I
have you guys I hope you enjoyed the
tutorial because my god I think this is
one of my favorite things I've ever made
