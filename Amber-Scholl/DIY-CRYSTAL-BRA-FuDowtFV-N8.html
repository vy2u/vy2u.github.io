welcome back to my channel happy
holidays ah hope you had a great
Thanksgiving and are gearing up for the
Christmas holiday shopping season
anyways so today we are going to be
doing the first part and what is going
to be I think like a three part series
of one of my most requested DIYs ever
which is crystallized body jewelry um if
you were big on Instagram like me
y'all know these are hella trendy right
now and not to mention hella pricey so I
thought I would make my own and show you
guys how to do it so today we are going
to bust out ah ha ha get it I'm
hilarious what a pun we're going to bust
out the first project in the series
which is going to be the crystal bra so
today I'm going to show you how to do
this because it's easy cheap and looks
amazing so here we go do-it-yourself
crystal bra
my god look at this is this not an
aesthetic or what Wow okay anyways so
here is what you're going to need you're
going to need some crystal uh ribbon I
guess this is literally like you can
kind of see it's just like a track of
crystals so I will Google this and find
out what this is actually called and
link you guys to some to buy in the
description fabulous and this is what
we're going to use to create this look
you are also going to need yourself some
little lobster claws and clasps third of
all you need what is called artistic
wire um it looks like a spool of thread
but it's actually a spool of really thin
little wire and that is what we're going
to use to oops there goes pick that up
there anyways this is what we're going
to use to attach the crystals basically
to themselves you'll see in a second but
get yourself some artistic wire good to
go we're also going to need some
tweezers and some scissors yes I finally
got some tweezers that are slightly less
disgusting so there we go grab your
favorite pair of tweezers some scissors
and that is all you need we will be good
to go alrighty so step number one is
going to be trimming the crystals as you
can see this particular part already
happens to be the perfect length to be
the triangle from my bra so we're just
gonna move along to this string which is
going to be kind of like the waist band
midsection thing um and you will just
wrap that around your waist until you
see where it fits give it a trim then
also you got to do the shoulder straps
so again we're just kind of eyeballing
it here seeing custom measurements sort
of to where you're going to want it to
be like I said you can just trim it with
scissors Boop and it will go right
through no need for hefty hardware and
you'll be good to go
to start on the craft alrighty so there
we go then you will just lay the pieces
together so you can kind of see how it's
going to be a bra and these are the
pieces that I cut first this is the body
piece and these are the shoulder strap
II pieces that I cut so you can see this
is how we're going to kind of lay it all
together and now all we need to do is
fasten because see these aren't
connected we need to fasten this
together and that is where the craft
wire comes in alright so you're just
gonna want to apply open one of the
little lobster clasps and take the body
chain here you can see sorry this is so
close up my nails look really bad today
because I like wanted to start this
project so I just let them get all
messed up like this one's a mask anyways
now important so then you're going to
want to take the body chain and what you
don't want to do is attach this end up
through the center like this you can see
these kind of have like little
and what you're going to want to do is
you can attach this through underneath
the bottom there the BAM there we have
it like I said I know I apologize it's
really hard to see but there you go you
can kind of see the little clasp is
through there there and what you're
gonna want to do is slip this in through
the clasp just like I did in the choker
video there we go but a big this is so
hard to see I'm sorry you guys but um
there
what I did was slip the clasp through
the clasp and then you will just go
ahead and press the close that up so now
super close up let me show you looks
like this there you go you can kind of
see the lobster clasp attached via the
ring buh-bam you're going to want to go
ahead and do the other side too as you
can see I actually did too i looped in
one right there and then i put in a
bigger one just so it'd be easier for me
to close the clasp so can dangle more
outside of it so you'll just close those
up and then as you can see you will be
able to close the clasp but BAM and this
is going to be the back of your bra so
here we go you can see I laid this down
flat in a circle this is where the your
back like your body will go in here and
this would be the front and this is the
back where the bra is going to clasp and
now we're going to take these pieces and
this is what we're going to do with
these these are going to be the front
kind of triangle part of the bra if you
kind of can see what I'm saying here
like your boobs will go here so what we
need to do is connect this piece to this
piece and that is where the wire is
going to come in alright so like I said
earlier this is kind of like just a wiry
string so it kind of looks like a spool
of thread you can just unwire a bunch
and what we're going to do is sort of
essentially so the wire with the two
pieces here to make them go together so
let's try this out alright so you can
see right here I actually did one side
just now because you guys might not know
this but I make these DIY projects up as
I film them so I need to always test and
do one side of something first but
anyways here we go so you can see I have
now basically sewn these two pieces
together using the little pieces of wire
you can see right there and this is how
I just did that you'll take the wire and
just you can sort of see it I know it's
like real
light but here we go you can see if I
hold it in both hands you really don't
need a lot maybe just this much she'll
just go ahead and trim that OOP so you
have just a nice little piece of wire
then you're going to go ahead and
connect this where you're going to want
this to be I flipped it over just so I
could see where all the little beads are
and then I will take the string and like
I said you're theoretically going to be
sewing this using the wire together so
here we go you will take the little wire
I know you guys can't see this I'm sorry
umm and you can just poke it through one
of the holes boom like you're sewing
tada I wish I could explain this better
but so then you will just continue the
process going in and out connecting this
piece to this piece you can kind of
twist the wire as you go so it doesn't
come off and that is how you will
connect it to this
so hear me go you can see I have wire
sewn it um can you see this kind of
these are all the little wires right
here interconnecting the two pieces
together and voila it is now why are
sewn together so we're just going to do
that to every single piece so the whole
thing can be connected you can see this
looks much more like a bra now we are
just going to take the shoulder straps
that we cut right here and we are going
to attach this piece to this piece this
piece to this piece and then of course
this down around to the back of the bra
so you can see this is kind of going to
be the armhole here and this is going to
be the triangle and this is where it
clasp surrounds so we are just going to
connect all of these pieces one by one
until it is all connected
whoo all right guys so you can see one
side is all done I don't know why I did
this upside down so hang on and we have
the full triangle with it attached to
the back end here so now we will just do
the other side and we will be all done
and tada this is what its gonna look
like once it's on it looks so stinking
good so here's some styling tips cool
about these is you can wear them with
all sorts of things this is like a
fabulous little holiday dress from what
my look and you can see it looks great
with this very I mean I wouldn't really
wear it to like your husband's Christmas
party or anything but maybe you know for
the after mass it's super fun mm-hmm so
there have you guys that is how I made
my crystal bra I hope you enjoyed the
little tutorial I'm going to be making a
thigh high jewelry thing tomorrow so
