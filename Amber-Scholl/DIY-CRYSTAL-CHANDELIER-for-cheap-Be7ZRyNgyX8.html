I'm not I'm wearing a nude body suit so
I guess sort of looking naked but
anyways that's not the point of this
video so you guys know I'm obsessed with
sparkles and recently I've just decided
I want to put chandeliers in literally
every single lighting fixture in my home
so I thought it'd be fun to go ahead and
try and make one of my own because
chandeliers are very expensive who knew
so without further ado here we go making
fancy crystal chandeliers broke bitch
style of course project but for now of
course as always here is my outfit of
the day which actually this mirror is
not that great for showing it cuz you
can't see my feet but hey you see sir
we've got the nude body suit which
really makes me look move it up we've
got some matching silky pants oh these
are so fun woo I'm like jasmine the
shoes you can barely see we got the nude
easy inspired shoes and voila there we
go oh look hey guys welcome to our
YouTube channel so uh Benjamin today we
are making a chandelier so we need some
crystals she got the hook up right there
right behind you all kind of oh I see
them look at all the trees if sparkly as
I have loved these trays for like years
and years but I've never gotten to
actually use them oh my god I'm so
excited okay so we're gonna get a lot of
these because well who knows how many
I'm gonna need so we'll just take a
couple of trays of these and head out
already we got the goods thank you thank
you see you soon
onward ho alrighty so it's actually the
next day which explains my different
hairdo and different top so it's
actually the same top in black anyways
who cares so uh are you ready to seize
the materials great
so for Benjamin I went ahead and picked
up a couple of trays of crystals these
are like 20 bucks
I think he said so got some crystal
chance to add to our little collection
of crystal ingredients we're gonna need
some little connectors I'll show you how
to use those in a second of course you
can't just build a chandelier out of
crystals you're going to need what's
called a chandelier frame and when you
get those on line for just a couple
bucks but you can see they look like
this you can see it's just like a little
silver rack with a contraption on zip
top some little press-on hooks and that
is really all we're going to need to get
started on this project so let's get
started
alrighty option number one is to
completely start from scratch and build
your own I'll be honest the first one is
the least practical but each here is how
you do it so for this one we're going to
need the crystals the chandelier frame
and the little attaches so all you do
for this one is you can see the frame
looks like this and there are little
teeny holes in it that is where we're
going to attach the crystals so you can
see we have the crystals which also have
holes in them you can go ahead and put
the little little metal bracket in there
to kind of bend it on to each other to
make it stay then you can individually
attach all the crystals on to the little
holes until the entire thing is covered
with the crystals tada you can see that
as kind of how chandeliers are built now
if you want the chandelier with layers
you can also buy extra layers to the
chandelier frame do the same thing and
then using a little metal wire you can
attach them all together and by using
various sizes of the chandelier rings
you can go ahead and see they're layered
it create kind of that drop look
raindrop drop top chandelier is I'm a
crop top that is not the words to the
song at all but who cares so much easier
option by one they're cheap on Wayfair
and Amazon you can get them for like 50
bucks you can just hang them right in
front of your light bulb you can see my
old closet I did that tada just right in
there with a hook from Target and it
looks pretty great so solid illusion
looks great you never know important tip
though this one is not hardwired to go
into the ceiling for actual lighting so
this one is really just purely for
decoration but if you want one for
actual lighting you're gonna have to go
ahead and order one that actually gets
hardwired electrically into the ceiling
so this brings us to project number two
which is much more practical so for this
one you need a chandelier that hardwires
into the ceiling for actual lighting I
went ahead and bought a cheap one on
overstock so you can see this one even
has like a little black frame already
around it and this will actually
hardwire right into the ceiling so it
will actually light up like this one
great those where I'm gonna hang them by
the way this is my closet so
I have two little boring lights in here
so I'm gonna go ahead and put the
chandeliers right there so anyways let's
get started so in addition to the fancy
frame you need some brackets what else
more crystals the same strands from
before and any other fancy crystals will
do the trick
this particular chandelier actually came
with really cheap ugly crystals which is
really hard to tell the difference on
camera but I'm telling you there's
actually such a big difference in person
that the expensive crystals actually
cost literally thousands of dollars more
than the cheap ones so if you want to
just buy it cheap chandelier for the
frame and the hardwired lighting with
the plastic crystals I just replaced
them with the nice ones yourself that's
a fun bitch tip - so to start this
project we have the little chain of the
crystal with the bigger dangly crystal
on the bottom and we're going to go
ahead and take the little metal brackets
and you can see you can just loop them
through the respective holes of each
crystal buh-buh and then bend them on to
attach them together so you can see that
is now connected so now where all the
little holes are in the frame you just
want to go ahead and hook the crystals
right into there like you can see our
little chain comes with a hook on the
top already so you can just go ahead
slip that right through the hole and
tighten it up boom perfect so tada you
can see it's hanging on there now now
we're just gonna go ahead and do the
rest oh it's starting to look good just
go ahead do the same thing one by one by
one until you get the finished product
by the way I had to get someone to
professionally install these so I felt
this part on a different day but up to
rush forward in time really quick and
voila oh you can see they look so pretty
in here oh just gorgeous by the way I'm
just standing on this little thing and
I'm like terrified I'm gonna fall down
so we're just gonna safely hop off this
okay anyways and of course we're saving
the best for last here is how you would
make a crystal eyes to lamp brevis one
you're gonna need the same ingredients
we need the crystals we need the strings
of crystals and then this one is where
we're going to use the hooks you can
also use command hooks those are a
little bit stronger than this so this is
a lamp that I already have in my room
but I thought it'd be fun to go ahead
and add some crystals to the bottom so
we are going to do it that way so what
you're gonna want to do is go ahead and
press the hooks all around the perimeter
of the lampshade you can see you just
press them on OOP perfect what do you
have them kind of space
around it doesn't really matter where
you put them you're gonna go ahead and
take the long strands of crystals and
you can kind of loop them like a
Christmas tree hooking them right on
like that tada until they kind of create
a little royal drapery effect once you
have those all settled and you can kind
of just have fun with it so you can
customize the design you can do anything
you want
there's round crystals there's square
crystals there's those whatever crystals
that I got literally anything that you
want to do you can make it all your own
we're just gonna go ahead and drape them
on the center of the lamp like this you
can add a couple more you can put some
crystals on the sides of it in front of
it behind it on the top on the bottom
whatever so pleases you until it all
kind of creates whatever effect that
you're looking for like this ah I've
actually never tried this before this
looks even better than I thought
Wow and that is how you create your own
little glamorous chandelier lampshade
so there you are but you guys that's
just how I made my very own crystal
chandeliers I hope you guys enjoyed the
