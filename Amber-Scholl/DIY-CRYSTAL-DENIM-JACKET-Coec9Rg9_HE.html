back to my channel so today in case you
can't tell by be extremely beautiful
aesthetic oh my God look at this
everything on fleek so today we are
channeling her inner Kylie Jenner Kim
Kardashian whoever the heck else wears a
blinged-out denim jacket and we are
going to make our very own I was super
inspired by Kylie Jenner's latest
Instagram look so many of you guys DM to
be asking me to do this project so I
went ahead and took some inspiration
from her and also Kanye's Met Gala
outfit which I loved by the way I know
they got a lot of hate for it but like
you look totally cool you can't hate on
a cool look in denim dude you know
another rant
anyways so today I'm going to go ahead
and show you my take on the new trend
DIY crystal oh my god this is literally
so dramatic whatever crystals denim
jacket alrighty first and foremost we're
going to meet a jean jacket I picked
this one up from forever 21 for 30 bucks
super cute light wash I just thought
this would be a good one go ahead and
decorate best part okay we're also going
to need some bling I got these downtown
basically these are just little
rhinestones pre-done appliques like you
can see they just kind of come on a
piece of mesh and it's just a giant
little sparkly design thing so I'm going
to go ahead and use these to design my
love I had left it at least you're going
to need some scissors and some e6000
glue and we can go ahead and get started
on the decorating oh my God look at this
aesthetic Wow okay
here we go alright so this project is
super easy what I'm going to want to do
first as you can see this is attached by
a piece of mesh so I'm just going to go
ahead and cut this in half so it's a
little bit easier I'm going to go ahead
and make a quick little snip right here
through it so I have two pieces instead
of one giant one and then I'm going to
go ahead and trim very closely because
close to the pattern as possible so I
can get rid of all the mesh and just
have a nice beautiful little piece of
crystal embroidery left over to glue on
to the jacket so I'm going to go ahead
do that to those pieces until that is
all I have left
beautiful alright so now that I got all
my little sparkly things
I'll individually cut into little chunks
and pieces I'm just going to go ahead
and lay them onto the jacket how I want
them to go so basically just you know
wherever I think they look nice I'm
going to put them on the shoulder blades
I think because
I think that's going to look like ooh
whoo like that's gonna look so cool
maybe I'll like drape it all down the
arm I'm not really sure yet but I'll go
ahead and just lay those out and see
what kind of design I can come up with
I'm going to lay this one on the
shoulder Boyd so it goes all the way
down the arm and I actually wish the
jacket was longer so to go ahead to and
extend the length and make it look more
oversized I think I'm going to go ahead
and put this one at the bottom here like
that so something like this and I'm just
going to go ahead and plop it on my
mannequin and pin everything all
together so here we go you can see this
is kind of the basic design I'm going to
go for we got it sort of pinned on the
bottom here super unprofessionally
because I don't know how to pin stuff I
need to go to fashion school but anyway
there you go you can kind of see how I'm
going to do that and now I'm just going
to go ahead and glue it on with some my
trusty 6-thousand glue all right so here
we go
all I'm really going to do here is go
ahead and take the e6000 glue turn off
and I am just going to basically just
glue this right on and really pray to
God that it is in the right spot don't
use too much glue because you don't want
it to seep through but that is basically
all you're going to do
you
all right there we go I went ahead and
glued this whole arm on and I'm just
going to go ahead and do the rest I know
I'm really glad I did my nails yesterday
Wow hmm okay anyways alright so now that
both sides of the top are all glued on
I'm just going to go ahead and glue this
little bottom chunk on there so
basically I'm just going to do literally
the exact same thing go ahead throw on
the glue credit down wait for it to dry
but a bing bada boom bang there we go
alright so I'm just going to go ahead
and wait for this to dry and then I'm
going to do the back alright so now I
just have to figure out what to do to be
mostly back of the jacket I have some
extra crystals from where I had cut the
little pieces off so I think I'm just
going to go ahead and plot these on here
maybe like this just lay them out
however I think they look good I don't
know I'll make some sort of pretty
design alright so after a million years
of deciding what to do I finally decided
to finish the design that I'm going to
glue on it so I'm just going to
literally do the same thing going on
uh-oh you guys I literally use the
entire container of this so if you're
doing this project to make sure you get
enough but we'll go ahead and throw this
in the land of Baghdad e6000 glues and
now that it is all done I'm just going
to go ahead and let this dry overnight
finish eating some kettle corn and we
will then have a real fashion show so
here we go you can see the jean jacket
before and there you have you guys oh my
god it looks so good so there is the
finished jean jacket all sparkly and
glittery and glow in the sunlight oh wow
alright fashion show time oh my God look
at this you guys okay so you can see oh
my gosh look at that side sledge Wow Wow
well can I hit the back here sort of
maybe fix which hand radius you can sort
of see the back there oh my God look at
it
it's so shiny and you can kind of just
wear it off your shoulders too like oh
my god it's a piece of art Wow all right
