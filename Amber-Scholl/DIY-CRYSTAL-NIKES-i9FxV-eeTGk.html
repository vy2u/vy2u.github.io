we're going no we're not totally kidding
I hate exercising so instead we're gonna
do a craft because I love frickin
crafting so as you guys know from my
shoe shopping blog the other day I did
just get a new pair of kicks tada
so cute but I figured these could be
even cuter um so I'm going to show you
guys how I'm gonna bedazzle the little
swoosh thing because you know just for
purely aesthetic reasons I'm probably
not gonna work out in them anyway
so here we go DIY crystal Sneaky's
alright guys so weird in the fact that
it's literally the middle of the night
but that's what I like to film my DIYs
sometimes apparently I don't know I
couldn't sleep so whatever here we go so
this is what we're going to need for
this project one of those little wax
pencils that I showed in my last DIY of
the crystal tights if you have one not
necessary but it helps if you have one
however if you don't guess what tweezers
work just fine also going to need some
of this see 6-thousand glue um this is
just what I use to glue stuff it's
really intense and it's kind of toxic so
be careful but anyways whatever I
haven't died yet and then we're going to
need some little Swarovski crystals I
picked these up for two bucks downtown I
got the really itty-bitty little ones
but um whatever size you want to do of
course you're gonna need a pair of shoes
these are the new Nikes that I bought
that you probably saw in my how to shop
for shoes video so I just thought I
would give them that special little
amber touch and pulling them out alright
the first thing you're gonna want to do
is empty the little packet of crystals
onto a flat surface um this is like the
little thing that I use for all my deal
wise you can see I've actually like
accidentally glued so much stuff to it
it's a mess I need a new one but anyways
right next to it you're gonna want to
dull up the glue out but I am there we
go and we can get to gluing the crystals
onto the shoes it's a pretty easy
project you guys nothing too crazy
alright guys so what you're gonna want
to do here is I'm going to take the
tweezers and put a little dip them in
the glue like so and take a little baby
dollop of glue Boop and put it right
onto the edge of the swish so here we're
going to start then I'm gonna go ahead
and take my little wax pencil thing pick
up one of the crystals
OOP here you go you can see it on the
edge there and then I will just place
that directly on to where I put the glue
one crystal down a bunch to go already
so then all we're going to do here is
line the entire outside of it with the
crystals until it is completed just
repeating the same process over and over
until you're done also all of these DIY
projects are running my nails so
annoying alright anyways whatever
interrupting this video for two
announcements one finally I have redone
my nails because it isn't how a couple
of days later and they look way better
second of announcements is um yeah in
what I can only think of as a temporary
bout of insanity I thought I only wanted
to do the outside but nope we're going
to do the whole thing so now I'm going
to finish in filling in the little
swoosh completely with even tinier
crystals than this so here we go tedious
project part to mind you when you're
doing it you're probably going to want
to do it by row just so it all stays
even like if you're just kind of
randomly plopping them on there it's
going to look a little random and this
will look much neater so you can see
here I've just done like the three and
I'm gonna line it all the way so it's
gonna take a long time but it's gonna
look awesome mm-hmm
flash-forward literally three hours but
tada look at that my shoes are all done
and this is so dramatic of me to put it
on this but whatever I wanted to just be
extra wow look at how beautiful so there
we have you guys that is how I bedazzled
my Nikes um okay have fun
woo so we're gonna have you guys that is
how I Krystal if I'd my sneakers and
made them fabulous um so now you know
when I'm at the gym or when I'm most
likely not at the gym
I can look blingy and great all the time
so hope you guys enjoyed as always if
you do anyway social media or what know
if you do any of my DIY projects please
tag me I love to see you guys's
creativity it's all at amber shoal so
snap me tweet me DM me whatever floats
your boat
um and I will see you guys super soon as
always I love you so very much kisses
till next time stay blingy my friends XO
yes goals
alright that's enough of that time to be
regular again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
