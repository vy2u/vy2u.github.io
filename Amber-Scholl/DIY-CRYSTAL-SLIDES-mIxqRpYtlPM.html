that's nothing out of the ordinary but
you want to see something cool ah is not
wearing my extensions today so I thought
I would Rock some short hair for this
vid not for any reason other than I just
you know felt like shaking it up so on
that note hey guys what's up it's amber
if you're new sorry for the really weird
intro my intros are always weird but my
hair usually is long and well to be
honest my highlights actually always
poppin but Sussie not important not what
this video is about so I'm actually at
Nordstrom earlier and I saw these a
beautiful fluffy crystallized slides and
I was like oh my god I need to buy these
but they were like over a hundred bucks
and I just couldn't help but think
whatever falls on walls so I went
downtown and went ahead and made my own
so even though this video is honestly
really kind of lame it's super easy
um and honestly anyone could have
thought of it but there's no one else
has done it yet I thought I would put
the video together for you so in case
you wanted to see oh I made my
crystallized slides I posted on insta
yes
all righty here we go this is all we're
going to need for this project like I
said super simple super easy so here's
what you need all you got to do is pick
out a pair of slippers slides whatever
you want I got these from forever21 for
like 14 bucks then we're going to need
some feather trim I got this at Joanne's
for like $4 of course it wouldn't be my
project if we didn't without the e6000
glue so grab some of that and then I
grab these little bow crystal appliques
from downtown I linked some super
similar ones in the description so that
is all we're going to need and we can
get started alright so the first step is
we're going to want to make the slides
furry so basically all I'm going to do
is I'm going to take the e6000 glue and
I'm going to glue the fur right on to
the slides I mean you can see I'm just
going to put the glue right on top of
there sticking it on to the little
ribbon 'part so it just sticks right on
in place and now these slides are fluffy
amazing super simple - so now that the
shoes are severely fluked like you can
see they look crazy just how I wanted
them to look and now I'm going to go
ahead and do what I do best gluing
things onto things plump
just like that so super simple just go
ahead take the e6000 glue and glue the
little crystal applicator right onto the
feathers it should stick pretty well and
there we go um you don't really stick
out too much on the white feathery
carpet things I'm going to move those to
show you the grand finale but bada-bing
bada-boom basically that's it after the
second and third they're literally just
by some pre flop slide grab some
crystals to match and that's it
alright so we're going to go ahead and
start out with the gold pair so I'm
going to take the gold crystals and
seriously you guys this project is so
easy I like almost feel silly doing a
DIY but literally all you're going to do
here take the e6000 glue again put it
right on to the crystals and then you
can just press it on right on to the
fluff and it will stick let it dry
overnight and but uh but all beautiful
crystal slides are you so for the
BlackBerry literally going to do the
same thing go ahead and cut this black
piece in half trim off the excess and go
ahead and glue it right on there - I
know one of you guys sent me this little
box cutter in my pea OVA and I cried
reading the letter I lost
so hard so thanks Trinity I love it and
that's all you do
bloom on and boom perfectly sparkly
slides
haha here they all are oh they're
sparkly homes looking fabulous than
these only cost me a whopping 19 bucks a
pair ready to Sparkle through the
stubble and I Robbie right that's
literally all I did glued it on
bada-bing buxom still that simple this
is part like 70 million of me gluing
stuff to stuff but anyways as always if
you have any other questions comments
concerns all of my socials are at Amber
Shoals you can hit me up on there I love
you guys so so so very much I will see
you super soon kisses - next time my
sweethearts EXO
I literally feel like a different person
with short hair
I just feel like I need to let go run
for City Council or something
ambush all make America sparkly again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
