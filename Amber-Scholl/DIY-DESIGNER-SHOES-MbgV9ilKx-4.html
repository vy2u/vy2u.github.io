remember that video no just me
okay anyways welcome guys it's amber and
welcome back to my channel so today I
thought it'd be fun to make yet again
another video about my shoes but don't
worry this was different than all the
other ones I promise today I thought it
would be fun to show you guys a couple
of the newest additions to my beloved
shoe collection and this time it's super
special because they're actually ones
that I made so get your creative juices
flowin we are going to be crafting up a
storm
DIY designer shoes what you're going to
need is basically a bunch of bedad
leapings whatever you want to put on the
shoes I went ahead and picked out some
cool crystals I got these in downtown
Los Angeles all of them are just really
cool these are like iron-on lace
appliques I got some lace little
thingies and this is what we're going to
use to decorate the shoes you're also
going to need some shoes major shout out
to a little for sponsoring this video
and sending me all the shoes to decorate
these are going to be so fun you're also
going to need some scissors some good
old trusty tweezers and my favorite
6-thousand super guys kind of stuff so
that is what we're going to need and we
can get started but for now we're just
going to look at this aesthetic oh my
god unbelievable okay here we go here we
go this issue number one and put a shoe
I thought it'd be fun to the Dead will
be heel because the heel just looks
boring it needs a little bit of so we're
going to go ahead and just glue these
appliqués on there I'm using the e6000
glue so I'm just going to go ahead put
some glue on to there and go ahead and
just press it right on to the heel like
this kind of as a dupe of those dolce
and gabbana Wow
so here again you can see the before all
right and here's the finished boobs ah
these are amazing they look so dolce
gabbana inspired and they're so stinking
cute I really need someone to help me
with this shoe addiction it's like
really getting next level all right here
we go this machine number two is so for
these I'm actually going to do something
super creative and like different I
don't know if this is even going to work
but I bought these like little fabric
things and I'm going to glue them on to
kind of make them look like little
booties so sort of like this so work
with me here I'm not sure how this is
going to work but let's see it okay so I
know this looks kind of weird but
basically I'm gluing the fabric on to
the spots on the shoe that I can glue it
on to like on the toe and right up here
on the heels I laid it on its side I
know this looks very strange but if you
do the project you'll understand what I
mean so here glue them on until you can
kind of see they look like little
booties then I'm just going to take
these little pearl applique thingies and
glue them right on in kind of a random
pattern until I like the way that it
looks so again here you go you can see
the before and cut all you guys you can
see they're all done I've got the little
pearls and the embellishment on them
they're so cute unfortunately I have to
hold them up like this or I'll say like
just fluff but they look super cute on
your feet so I'll show you those in a
second like tada oh my gosh is that
these the knotted oh these are so laying
the game oh so so cute
already and here is pair number three so
what we're going to do for this one is
like I said this is like a beaded
appliqué thing and I am literally just
going to go ahead and this is actually
an iron-on but I don't think I can earn
this onto a shoe so I'm going to go
ahead take Facebook's bags and glue
again and glue this right on to the shoe
like that
here I wanted it to kind of come up a
little bit off the shoe so like little
angel wings like that I just thought
that was so fun I'm just going to go
ahead and glue that on there hold it
down and press it on I think I've
probably like I said I'm probably gonna
let this dry overnight and then that
will be that we'll be good to go
so here again you can see the before and
now the after unbelievable these looks
so good look at that is this not the
fanciest frickin show you've ever seen
in your life
how extras I love it I love it I love it
you can see I've been prancing around
and healed a little too much my floor is
all stuffed up but my shoes oh my god
and since I like to number three so much
I've literally get to do the exact same
thing to chute number four because it is
the same shoe just in black of so you
can see I just went ahead repeated the
exact same process and made that shoes a
little black twin oh my gosh look how
nice it is whoo just as cute is the
other one these are so fire oh my god
whoo and this issue number five and
perfect hair and basically going to do
the exact same thing I'm just going to
go ahead and take the feathers and glue
that to the outside of these
tolerate it bloom there we go
now I'm just going to go home and add to
eat cows so here again you can see the
before and here at me after and they're
kind of Chanel inspired but uh mostly
their signature Couture amber shoal
original okay so let me have you guys
that is how I made my very own designer
shoes I've always if you have any
questions comments concerns
oh my socials are at amber show so hit
me up on there oh let's see I guess
that's it I love you guys so much thanks
for watching and I will see you guys
super soon go slay your new heel game I
love you kiss until next time my sweet
baby angels EXO work it work it even in
your sweatpants and overtime this is
where I actually wear what I'm solving
you guys really look like a mess and
this still has a tag on it but whatever
you're shooting okay oh yes so haunting
work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
