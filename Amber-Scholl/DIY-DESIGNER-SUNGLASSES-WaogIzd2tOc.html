more like can't see anything no actually
because I'm literally inside and
definitely don't need the offense
anyways what's up pumpkin
it's amber and welcome back to my
channel so today in honor of the
recently beautiful weather outside at
least in Los Angeles anyway I thought
it'd be fun to go ahead and do my first
little summary spring tutorial of the
year and do some DIY designer sunglasses
because I guess you have CDs online
these are extremely expensive and can
run upwards of a grand or more like here
you can see the dolce gabbana version
thousand libya marine and this random
brand version whoo and well you guys
know better than anyone I'm going to use
my hair the pointer of you guys know
better than anyone that I love a good
sparkly something and since I don't want
to drop a grand on a pair of sunglasses
and I'm probably going to lose at the
beach and I'm going to go ahead and DIY
them and mix it myself so here we go
my version DIY designer sunglasses I
look like a cat or something rare okay
here we go first thing you're going to
need obviously is some sunglasses so
pick out some sunglasses cheap one
they're best because I don't know cheap
everything is best these are like five
bucks downtown LA so these are what
we're going to decorate to decorate the
sunglasses we are going to use everyday
jewelry basically so I picked up some
stuff from forever 21 some cool little
necklaces some really fancy little
earrings that I got downtown these are
actually so beautiful I almost don't
want to use them for this project but
I've got a headband with some
butterflies on it all sorts of random
sparkly things that I'm going to
decorate this on glasses with would it
be an ever shoul DIY if you didn't get
to be sick spells and glue some good old
trusty tweezers and some scissors and
that is all originated to go ahead and
get started alright so first things
first for all of the jewelry what I'm
going to do for the earrings is this is
going to get in the way a little earring
thing so I'm just going to bend it
backwards there we go just kind of push
on it with your finger
OOP there we go now it's flat easier to
glue a glue on to stuff and for the
headband same thing I'm just going to go
ahead and pluck off on the little
butterflies I like kind of twisting them
off there like that
with a little necklace I'm just going to
go ahead and kind of like undo all of
the clasps on it so I can just have easy
access to all of the leaves all righty
so here we go these are the first pair
we're going to decorate vanessa is going
to be super easy literally all I'm going
to do is take these really pretty black
earrings and I'm going to glue them I
believe to the top of them so it kind of
looks like this so literally just take
the e6000 glue kind of put it all over
the rim of the sunglasses and then just
go ahead stick the bearing kind of on it
however you want it's a little slippy
and slidy but you get the gist just glue
it right on there
all righty there we go it's just going
to go ahead and let those dry and move
on to the next pair all right so next up
we have this silver pair of glasses so
what I'm going to do for this one
actually is go ahead and design the
sides because I thought that would be
super fun
so basically again all we're going to do
I'm going to go ahead and use these
beautiful earrings them that I got for
literally like 90 percent off downtown
they were only 15 bucks I'm going to go
ahead and glue those onto the sides
right here like so again just using the
e6000 glue to glue it right on there and
bam that's it
all right here we go this is the last
pair before and for this one we're going
to do this one really extra fancy
because I don't know life store let's do
it right so I got all the little bees
and butterflies and stuff detached from
the necklace and so I'm just going to go
ahead and glue those on design them just
like I would anything else glue them all
on in a random pattern I don't know
maybe we'll go home on the sides here
too just for fun
whew looking so pretty and sparkly so
yeah I'll just go ahead and glue them on
in any sort of arrangement that I feel
like see what I can come up with and
tada Wow looks better than I thought and
there you have it folks the finished
products honestly I think if I just put
these in the window dolce and gabbana
they probably sell I would love to do an
experiment if they would be down but
anyways there we go
glittery glam and oh so fabulous so
grand finale time for a fashion show so
we can see first pair before and then
BAM you can see after oh my goodness
they look so cool black and shiny and
sparkly and well overall fabulous pair
number two being silly okay got a focus
but you can see here the side design
came out so cool
love it very Bulgari senses fancy
alright don't know what's going on here
been filming too long gonna stop now and
here we go you can see pair number three
looking good
oh my goodness these looks so cool kind
of Ralph Andrew so inspired oh yeah baby
Coachella vibe ready to go so there you

designer duds I hope you guys love to
