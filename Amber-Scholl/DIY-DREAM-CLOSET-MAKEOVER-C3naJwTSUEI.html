back to my channel so um if you guys
have been following me on snapchat and
Instagram you guys know that I have been
renovating my closet for the last like
two weeks and I've been dying to show
you guys I'm so excited so today's the
day it's finally done so are you guys
ready are you ready to see it
I'm so excited can you tell okay anyways
here we go tada
is this not just my dream closet or what
okay so you guys might remember before
it was absolutely disgusting but I have
organized it now and redone the whole
thing a super easy DIY style so I'm
going to show you exactly how I did that
with a couple of easy tips alright so
the first thing I did to make my little
closet Oasis was reorganize my clothes I
know that sounds dumb and like so
blatantly obvious but I did was i
color-coordinated everything as you can
see I have all of my blacks right here
I had my black and whites right there
fading into my whites and to my pigs and
of course on the other side fabulous
rose gold selection with the greys and
then of course my denim this is my mom's
jacket actually super cool but I love it
but anywho Z that is a super easy way to
make your closet look more glam and put
together another pro tip when you're
organizing um make sure you color
coordinate the hangers to your clothes I
know that seems very extra but check
this out
so all of my black clothes are on these
black felt hangers all of my white
clothes are on these white felt hangers
pink clothes are on these taupe hangers
so that just makes it look extra
coordinated alright so as for my shoes
again I'm lucky enough to have a walk-in
closet even in my apartment which is
super nice I'm actually a really big
closet
especially for Los Angeles but anyways
again I color-coordinated elbaite shoes
put them up on these shelves um and put
them these are my children by the way
this is my baby and this is my other
baby and I'm obsessed with them but
anywho Z um yeah I color-coordinated all
my shoes just plop them up there to make
them look a little better displayed
instead of just
on the floor how I had them before PS if
you don't have those shelves in your
closet like I do super easy
hang some I got this shelf from Ikea
this is one of their infinity lakh
shelves it was $20 so easy to install
literally just drill it into the wall I
did that myself in two seconds and this
shelf is also from Ikea fantastic put
your extra shoes on it I know this isn't
technically in my closet but like I said
if you don't have room your closet get
yourself one of these it looks great and
does the same thing you might have also
noticed I redid the carpet because the
carpet in here was actually like brown
and really ugly so I thought it would be
fun to put in some white faux fur now
originally this project was going to be
I was going to make it a rug but then I
got carried away like I always do it
decided why not just Reef lure the whole
thing so literally all this is you guys
is a giant piece of fabric that I bought
at Joanne's and laid it on to the ground
so covers up you can see they're ugly
yeah fold this over and now it's
beautiful alright so you guys can't
barely tell this but I'm now standing on
a box in the middle of my closet like a
psycho because I wanted to get closer to
the ceiling so I could show you guys
what I did to this little area right
here you might recognize that do you
recognize the marble shelving paper that
I used to marbleize my granite
countertops yes maybe you do if not you
can watch that video right here in this
link but anyways oh yeah so I just
thought it would look super glam if I
put some marble up in here so I used the
leftovers and just stuck it onto the
wall looks pretty good if I do say so
myself by the way while I'm up here I
put a nice shopping bag up here because
that's a great way for secret storage is
to put a shopping bag that you like and
adds aesthetic but put stuff inside it
so in this one I've got tada a bunch of
extra hangers so that way my closet
isn't cluttered and it looks really nice
and is all organized and doesn't have a
thousand extra hangers just hanging in
there I have all of them in here so when
I need one I can just grab one but you
would never know that they're up there
sneaky sneaky all right you guys super
easy pro tip um if you're like me and
like have a weird aesthetic and are
drawn to crystals all the time no matter
how tacky they are
I've always always my whole life one of
the chandeliers so I decided the perfect
place to put one in my apartment was my
closet so that was probably the easiest
part and what really added the most
aesthetic to the closets
Soho here's how I did that okay so as
you can see this looks a hella glamorous
and so cute but um let me just show you
spoiler alert
this isn't actually even a real
chandelier it's purely decorative and I
didn't install it huh no the light in my
closet is actually hanging behind it and
this is not even touching it all I did
see if I come up here on my stool where
is it
there we go I bought a little Hulk from
Target it was like three bucks twisted
it into the ceiling and then hung it
right on top of it so it's not even
attached to the light whatsoever but it
is hanging right in front of it so it
creates the optical illusion that it is
so that is a really cool way and like I
said this is a crystal chandelier that I
got downtown it's not actually crystal
so if you google acrylic chandelier it
has the same look as a crystal but is
made of plastic and it's like 30 bucks
so Google acrylic chandeliers I'm sure
you can find one just as cute and just
as cheap you might have noticed I have
on my closet door this is like when you
close it but when you open it um I have
my robe my little silky bathrobe thing
that I wear in the morning and sometimes
at night hanging on that this is
actually a wreath hanger um that I got
again at Joanne's for like two bucks
it's an over-the-door it's called a
wreath hanger so literally you would
hang like some kind of wreath on it but
I thought that would be an easy way oh
god that was violent to store my robe so
we definitely recommend that for quick
easy organizing all right final closet
tip of the day I have hung some pictures
I'm getting more printed today of my
favorite fashion looks that really
inspired me of course Kim and Kanye
there they are and here they are again
um
his looks were just so fire I loved them
so I printed them out in black and white
and hung them here I'm going to have a
bunch more of a bunch of different
people all over the wall so when I walk
into my closet I can have a bunch of
inspiration for my look of the day
anyway there you guys have it that is
how I read in my closet um here in my
apartment for I think the entire closet
renovation cost me maybe seven
so definitely worth it definitely
super-easy and definitely would
recommend because I feel like a new
person like I feel like I live in the
lap of luxury now one before it looked
like uh I lived in a hurricane oh we
definitely recommend if you have the
time to spare and put into your closet
to fund weekend projects so um if you
have any questions about any of the
products or any of the things that I did
feel free to comment below I will always
answer all the questions and of course
all my social media is at amber soul so
hit me up there slide into my DMS and
I'll always respond because I love
chatting with you guys so it kisses till
next time XO usually I do like funny
little clips at the end of something
funny but uh there's nothing funny about
this this is just so great ah I love it
so much I'll be funny in my next video
okay bye guys goodbye good night goodbye
closet I love you good night</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
