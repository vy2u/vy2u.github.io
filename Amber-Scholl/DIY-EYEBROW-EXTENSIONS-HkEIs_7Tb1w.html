these frickin brows whoa what's up you
guys it's amber and welcome back to my
channel so today I'm going to show you
guys what I think is my greatest DIY
project ever there's three of ever
do-it-yourself eyebrow extensions like
oh my god could you die this is the most
fleeky brow I've ever seen in my life
okay anyways um so I've had just
struggled the century with my eyebrows
for the last like 10 years I got a bad
wax one so they never quite grew back so
I've been struggling ever since you've
seen them in my other videos I know that
you don't like them because all the hate
comments so today I thought that I would
do a little DIY project because I
figured if you can do lash extensions
why not brows so here we go and
do-it-yourself
fleeky eyebrows 2016 Instagram ho brows
already guys so for this project you are
going to need some tweezers and some
cuticle scissors we're also going to
need some false lashes and these are my
faves black magic lashes style man-eater
swear by them usually I would say
store-bought lashes are fine however for
this particular project you need to have
lashes that have the tapered edge like
this because we're going to make these
into eyebrows so you have to buy either
the silk or human hair lashes so that is
why I recommend these because the
store-bought lashes will look crazy so
last but not least we need the glue this
is professional-grade
eyelash extension glue actually if you
can find eyebrow extension glue
obviously use that but this was all I
could get at my local beauty supply
store it was expensive this was $79
however theoretically this will last me
13 lifetimes because there is so much in
here and you need literally this tiny
little did I very much upper lash so it
is a worthy investment because it's your
eyes guys you don't want to skimp on
this um and this is the only glue that
will work so there we go let's get
started
PS before we get started I do just have
to make this little disclaimer I am
a professional lash technician by any
stretch of the imagination
so please proceed my gosh okay guys so
the first step is what you're going to
want to do is cut the lashes into little
chunks so you can just cut them like
boop-boop-boop as you can see here's a
chunk here and what you're going to do
you're literally going to turn these
into eyebrows so you obviously don't
want them to be this long so you will
just cut maybe around here until they
fall off into little tiny individual
hairs yes this project does take a long
time because we are going to be gluing
each of those little guys right on to
our skin so just cut those until you
have a nice little pile and then we can
get started alright so the next step is
you're going to take the glue just take
the cap off and you need such a tiny
amount of this I will just stick a
little itty bit on a flat surface I'm
like this is the cap of some bottle that
I had and you will just put the tiniest
little droplet ever
boop-boop can you see that it's really
small because you barely need any so all
you're going to do is put that there you
can close close up the bottle and we can
get to gluing the lashes on - all right
okay
so when I say take off all your makeup I
mean it take it all off literally bear
face - nothing on you want your skin to
be really clean and really dry for this
so the glue will stick on so I'm going
to selfie cam it real quick so you can
really get a good look at what my
eyebrows look like before um you can see
there's nothing really wrong with them
they're just not as thick as I would
like them to be um I got a bad wax once
and like they never really grew back
like right here and they're just kind of
thin on the bottom so I want them to be
thick and fluffy like I haven't made my
instagrams um by the way yeah I do have
my eyelash extensions on I do those
myself too if you want to see a video on
that but for now we are going to focus
on the brows cuz it's 2016 you know got
to keep them on fleek so let's see what
we can do with these puppers getting
started right now alright so once you
pick your eyelash from your little
collection there you just pick them up
one by one
you will go ahead and
it into the glue loop and then it is
ready to be stuck on your eye okay so
when it comes to actually putting them
onto your skin what you're going to want
to do is take the lash and put it
basically anywhere that you would want
to fill in your natural brow I
personally want them to be a little bit
more dense right here so I'll put a
couple right here and then I also want
them to come more a little bit up and
arched over so I'm going to fill in this
part as well just anywhere that you
would usually fill in your brow just go
ahead and stick some of these on there
instead all right so I'm going to want
to put it probably around there like I'd
showed you where I wanted to put it
earlier you will just take it and
lightly press it onto the skin yes one
by one but it should stick virtually
immediately because like I said this
glue is super strong so you can just
kind of tap it on there and you can see
it is already looking like eyebrows you
will just continue doing that until you
have them all filled in
tada alright so as you can see it's
definitely starting to get a lot more
filled in especially compared to the
other one you can see that ones like
this this one's looking fluffy now um
now we're also going to want to put some
in here because I like to have the
density of that a little bit increased
so I will just go ahead and take them
one by one and put them kind of facing
straight up instead of these I've been
kind of putting facing um what direction
is horizontal and these are going to put
a little bit more vertically just
sticking them right on there so there
you go you can see I'll just play some
one by one sorry you can't see that well
but it's really hard to film this with
such clothes and of an angle but also
you can also see pull apart your
eyebrows little stick them in the center
there and that will give them more
density and thickness so that's what's
really going to make em extra extra full
well alright guys so our selfie camming
it again but as you can see here is the
one that I have not done um and here is
the one that I have done so it is a huge
difference um you can see it like really
brings out my eyes and whatnot um but
yeah totally wow this really looks
different whoa whoa so I'm just going to
go ahead and do the other side and
repeat the process until both brows are
perfectly on fleek oh my god I'm
literally gonna scream this looks so
good oh my god I haven't had AI brows in
like oh my god I don't even know 20
years since I was 3 no um but seriously
ok so this is my face still completely
bare so I'm sorry I'm like a giant zit
on my forehead but whatever I was too
excited to post this so you can see this
took about two hours to do both about an
hour and eyebrow but um I would say this
is the most worthwhile two hours of my
life time um so there you go I'm just
gonna go ahead and like put on some
makeup so I don't feel as awkward
talking you guys so hang on let me get
glam and then I'll be right back
actually before I go one more look here
oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god
you guys this is the most beautiful
thing I've ever seen
I can't believe it my eyebrows are
finally what I want them to look oh my
god
I'm like gonna get really emotional cry
but what is
really sad I don't know all right the
frequently asked question how long do
these last um tell me honest I don't
know because the first time that I've
ever done this project was just now when
I filmed it so according to the lady
that I bought the glue from and
according to the package that glue is
supposed to last six to eight weeks
because it is professional-grade so I
would imagine that these would last
maybe a month uh I don't know honestly
sorry this is a not a professional DIY
amber how do I take them off they're
stuck good they should be stuck uh-huh
but if you want to remove them there is
remover that you can buy along with the
glue and because this will not come off
with soap and water this is like I said
professional-grade glue they should kind
of fall off on their own in about a
month whenever the glue is kind of run
its course but if you want to buy the
remover totally can and it will come
right off just as it would um if you
were getting them removed at a
professional salon as for wearing makeup
totally and go ahead if you want to
darken them up even more go
drybeck up so go for it removing your
makeup just use oil-free makeup remover
you can use soap and water on them
they're not going to come off because
like I said this is professional-grade
glue so these are stuck on their babes
until you use the remover to remove them
or they naturally fall off in however
many weeks they last these are gonna be
on your face so don't worry about them
too much they are a little bit sturdier
than you might think so there you have
you guys that is how I do my own eyebrow
extensions um I hope you enjoyed the
video because my god did I enjoy making
it though it did take me a long time um
I think I just I really think this could
change wives here people
no more filling in her breasts I could
cry at the thought okay anyways as
