amber welcome back to my channel so
today it totally looks like I'm naked
but of course I'm not you guys I'm
wearing a shirt why would I ever film a
video not wearing a shirt granted I do
film videos not wearing pants sometimes
but anyways not the point in this video
so today I'm going to do the very
long-awaited eyebrow extensions update
and tell you a although beeps on how
long they lasted all that blabbity
blabbity blah oh sorry oh eyebrow
extensions update I wish I could read
one eyebrow but can't do that so anyway
all right there we go common question I
get asked is how long did they last they
lasted basically perfectly for about the
full three weeks none of them fell off
no they don't fall off in the shower
they don't fall off in water they don't
fall off with makeup remover they stayed
on there like really good like I said
it's practically like super glue the
glue it was professional-grade so those
little puppies did not go anywhere for a
long time that being said I did take
very good care of them I used oil-free
makeup remover just because you know I
didn't want the oil to somehow mess with
the glue not that I really think that it
would but so oil-free makeup remover is
definitely recommended just to keep it
on and give them a little bit extra
lasting shelf-life on your face how
often do you have to refill them okay so
like I said mine all basically every
single hair stayed in place for about
three weeks and then it wasn't like I
woke up and all of them fell out it was
that's not how it worked at all and it
started to fall out at about the three
week mark gradually they just got a
little bit fitter so I just filled them
in as I went I would just take a couple
more eyelashes and glue it right back
off of so it's kind of like one fell up
and I would just put another one right
back in its place so that ended up
making them last I never had to actually
fully redo them at all the ends was
really where it was coming off the most
so I would just refill those a little
bit um and then they look good as new
people also ask if you can take showers
with them and swim with them yes you
guys of course you can take showers
please don't do eyebrow extensions and
then stop showering oh yeah they don't
come up in this hour it's all good they
last through they're waterproof so no
worries on nuts they did end up lasting
like I said for a long time and I never
any of them falling off specifically in
the shower basically at all I wish I
took more pictures but this is basically
the only one that I have here is a
picture right after I took my first
shower and so there you go you can see
that none of them fell out in the water
I got a lot of questions asking if you
weren't if you didn't have dark hair how
are you supposed to do them there are
plenty of eyelashes that you can buy and
even specifically eyebrow extension but
you can get on Amazon that are made for
blondes and redheads and any other shade
of hair that you have so I included some
of those in the link to this video if
you want to nab those but those are
basically the best recommendation that I
have um if you don't have stark hair
like me one of the biggest thing that
you guys were concerned about and
honestly so was I was if my natural
eyebrows were going to fall out when I
did them and the answer is no I did not
notice any of my natural eyebrows fall
out at all granted like it's that I
wasn't gluing the hairs to my eyebrows I
was gluing them directly on to my skin
so don't worry about that
your natural eyebrows are not to go in
anywhere with this one so a lot of
makeup professionals actually commented
on my last video and we're like this
isn't safe you shouldn't put the glue
directly on your skin nothing happened
to me obviously I'm not a medical
professional or any sort of professional
like I said but nothing happened to my
skin personally and I have pretty
sensitive skin so I certainly had no
adverse reactions to the glue at all and
gluing it right on my skin nothing bad
happened the remover like literally
nothing I just personally had no issues
so obviously like I said I'm not
licensed I'm not like any sort of
official word on that but for me
personally I had no problem so take that
as you will can you still wear makeup
with them absolutely I do your own
makeup whatever you want to do nothing's
going to bother them however as someone
who loves to wear a ton of makeup like I
love to take my face every day it's just
fun I'm really an artsy person so I
quite enjoy doing that even when I had
the eyebrow extensions in I still felt
the need for some reason to fill in my
eyebrows with like darker pencil and
whatever and I do not recommend that at
all that did make them look a little
funky because trying to remove it like
it got kind of stuck in the eyebrow if
that makes any sense
and I just if you have the eyebrow
extensions in and you want them to last
a long time do not fill them in with
pencils
or anything because it just makes them
look weird like just you already have
eyebrows there's no need to do that so
yeah there you go
Oh eyeshadow everything foundation
obviously is fine but I wouldn't wear
any makeup on your actual eyebrow except
for gel maybe to hold them in place but
even that probably best if you just
refrain from all things and leave them
in their natural state all that being
said people always ask what I actually
recommend them the answer is I have two
answers actually yes and no here's
someone who likes more of a natural look
and doesn't wear a ton of makeup on a
regular basis absolutely I think they
were awesome I loved them when I had
them in I just felt like I woke up and
just so pretty and like my face was
really complete um so that was really
nice especially with my added eyelash
extensions I just felt like I woke up
and looked at them really nice without
having to really do too much to my face
like they're great for special events or
great price you're going on vacation and
aren't going to have access to like
makeup for a long time if you're going
to camp
I don't know this camp still exists
anyways so I would recommend them for
that however like I said if you're
someone like me who wears tons of makeup
everyday and still thinks they're going
to want to color in your eyebrows
I got like kind of wouldn't recommend
them in a way I'm just if you're going
to go ahead and like spill cake makeup
all over your eyebrows regardless of
having them filled in or not there's
really no point to waste your time doing
it I guess so I guess that's the verdict
on that yeah that's being said people
asked if I still have them in and the
answer is no I do not have the eyebrow
extensions and personally anymore I just
changed switched up my actual filling in
my eyebrows routine a little bit because
like I said I love to wear makeup a
little too much and I think even when I
have like a natural look with the
extensions I just still felt like I
wanted to color them in so that's the
deal on that I have just switched up my
eyebrow routine to kind of mimic the
look of the extensions unless you want
to see a full routine on that I'd be
happy to do it because I think you and I
both know that this looks way better
than my old brows which literally make
me want to die looking at them like I
honestly tried to ignore the hateful
comments on most of my videos but there
were so many hateful comments on my
brows I was like maybe there is
something wrong with them and honestly
looking back you guys were right that
was that was an unfortunate stage in my
eyebrow life but for six now
thanks guys uh I guess on that note that
is kind of the finished little essay on
my brows and as always if you have any
more questions comments concerns only
socials are at amber so if you can hit
me up on there I'm going to try and
answer as many comments as I can on this
if you have any more so please anything
I didn't answer let me know and also
it's the best way to get ahold of me
honestly is probably Twitter because I
really don't have that many followers
there to be honest so I usually try to
go ahead and see most of the tweets so
if there something specific that you
want yes sir go ahead and ask me on
there and I will do my best to respond
so I love you guys
so very much I hope you guys enjoyed the
little brow tutorial and by the way I
just wanted to say thank you to anyone
who watched that video and to anyone who
recreated the look on Instagram or
anything like I'm so like humbled and
everything that that idea reached so
many people and it really means a lot to
me so thank you guys I'm so glad that my
chilly little idea of gluing hairs onto
your face which shakes the makeup
industry so much so thank you for
watching and I love you guys i will see
you super soon enjoy your eyebrows ledge
and I will see you guys next time this
is my sweet little pumpkin angel pie
lovers EXO
