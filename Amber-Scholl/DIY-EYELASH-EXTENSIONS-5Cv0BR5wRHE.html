today I don't know what's going on but
it's so beautiful I feel like a little
magical unicorn I'm loving it Oh anyways
not important um so what's up guys is
amber welcome back to my channel so um
the other day I filmed my everyday
makeup tutorial and I mentioned in the
beginning of the video that I do my own
eyelash extensions and I got turned
pharaohs and questions about them so
today I decided I would film how I do it
because it's so easy literally anyone
can do it so here we go my doing
yourself parish extensions okay now
these are rainbows are like starting to
get in the way I can't film this um oh
okay here we go
so before I start this video I just want
to say again I'm not a certified lash
extension specialist I'm not a certified
makeup artist in fact I'm not a
certified anything so make sure you
exercise caution when doing this but it
is safe when done properly so here we go
just had to give you that little
disclaimer warning but other than that
here we go okay so here you can see my
eyelashes before just clean them off
make sure there's nothing on them and we
can get started all you need for this
project is some individual lashes I
actually cut my own by chopping up my
favs black magic lashes so I will just
take those and trim them into a bunch of
little tiny pieces only because I'm an
eyelash snob and so I prefer the mink
lashes over the ones you buy in the
store however the step is totally
optional the other ones will do just
fine the other thing you'll need is some
lash glue this is our Dell lash tight
adhesive five bucks at Sally's grab that
your fav pair of tweezers and we are
good to go
let's get started alright so once you
have your lashes all set up and ready to
go unscrew the cap you will just pour it
onto a flat surface not a lot just a
little you don't need too much and then
just screw that on so it doesn't dry out
and we will get started all right so as
you can see we will just take the
tweezers and pick up one lash at a time
and then dip it into the glue you don't
need to get too much on there but just
get enough so that it's covered and then
we will start to place them on our eyes
okay so then we will just take the
teasers and one by one place the lashes
on to your natural lash line
actually touching your skin you are
literally directly gluing the lashes on
to your natural lash line super close to
your skin but not actually touching it
um and then you will just layer them on
until you get the desired look some
short some long just mix them up until
they all look fabulous as you can see
here they're looking great it takes a
little while but just proceed with
caution and you will be good to go then
I will just take my mascara put it on
the lower lashes never on the top
because you don't need to but um I will
brush them with a little like brush
thing I got at Sally's Edmond after a
few minutes you will have your lashes
look and lash licious yes I did just
make that word up but that's what they
are
lash licious mm-hmm add it to the urban
dictionary yes I know you're gonna ask
and these will usually last about two
weeks three weeks depending on how well
you take care of them just make sure you
use oil-free makeup remover when you're
picking off your makeup and that way
they will stay on longer and lasts a
little bit extra life um also it's
always so funny to me I literally do
DIYs and the first thing you guys always
want to know is how to undo it so here
we go this is our doll lash free
adhesive remover you will just place
that onto your lashes and they will
literally come right off don't pull them
but if you push on them a little bit
after an adhesive remover has worked you
can literally slide them right off your
lashes and you are bare lashed yet again
so there you have it you guys that is
how I do my lashes um if you have any
questions comments concerns obviously
get me up in the comment section below

of course all my socials are at amber
