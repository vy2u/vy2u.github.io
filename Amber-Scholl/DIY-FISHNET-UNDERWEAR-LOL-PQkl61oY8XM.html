back to my channel so today this is just
a quick little bonus video because I
wasn't planning on posting this but I
got so many questions about the little
fishnet things that I was wearing in my
thumbnail of the do-it-yourself ripped
jeans video then I thought I'd make a
quick little tutorial because it
literally is so easy you're going to die
when you see what I do you're gonna be
like really I didn't think of those
myself so here we go quick little DIY on
them some fishnet undergarments I don't
even know what you'd call them whatever
here you go
watch away okay guys for this
do-it-yourself you will need two special
ingredients one pair of scissors and two
some fishnets and that is all so here we
go
so I I'm sorry this was so funny oh my
god I don't know why this looks so weird
take it as a package anyways so here we
go these are the fishnets removed from
the package I don't know if I got a
child-size or what but these look so
small and like some weird creature hello
rah-rah-rah anyways okay No so just take
them out of the package and there is um
literally one step to making these into
little booty shorts and it's this all
you have to do is take the scissors snip
a snipah get rid of these actually maybe
we can do something fun with these but
for now there we go
that's it I know right why didn't I
think of that you're welcome
okay so when you're making it into the
top this is a little bit different you
definitely want to make sure you get a
plus size because my god if you don't
they are so tight and so tiny um
especially on Meek's
I have a bigger chest but unless you're
a size like negative two it's not gonna
work so get a plus size because will be
easier to fit around your body um so
we're gonna kind of reverse it so as you
can see this actually these are the
tights upside down it kind of already
looks like a top a little bit you can
see if you pull it oh there we go look
at that it's a shirt almost so all you
have to do for this is cut around the
crotch area
um and you can stick your neck through
that so then it will then be a shirt now
you just want to cut the arms because
obviously you don't want them to be this
long so just trim them if you want it to
be short sleeve long sleeve you can cut
it obviously however you want
I don't even gonna make this one long
sleeve for like three-quarter length but
if you want it to be a tank top just
snip the sleeves completely off you can
cut them shorter or longer it's whatever
you want I'm gonna do long sleeve like I
said so I'm going to cut like this tada
there we go and you can see it looks
like a shirt now so you can slip it on
and test it out so you go you guys you
can see what they look like on I would
never wear them with this outfit in
particular because it doesn't make any
sense I just didn't want to wear that
fishnet top because that's a little
revealing to wear on here but you can
see they look pretty cool um definitely
spices up an outfit and gives you that
Kitty Kay
keilly vibe so here you go you can see
how I styled it in my Instagram looks
super fun this is definitely a sexier
look based off of Kim Kardashian's insta
so if you guys are under 18 please
please please leave this project to the
adults this one is fun but definitely on
the sexier side now I want you guys to
stay into some little babies forever so
that's just my little two cents so
you're happy guys that is how I make my
little fishnet sets that I wear with
jeans or whatever um super easy like too
easy it's almost sad that I made a
do-it-yourself of this but you know
there you go so there you have you guys
that's my quick little tutorial on the
fishnet things again if you've any

was such a short video but there really
is like nothing to it so I'll see you
