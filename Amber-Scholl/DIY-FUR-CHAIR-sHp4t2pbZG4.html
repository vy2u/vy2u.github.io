kidding what's up guys it's amber and
welcome back to my channel so today
we're going to do a little construction
project and so busting out the spray
paint and the weird flannels because I
saw this chair that I wanted I saw it on
Instagram and I've been dying to have it
but I finally found it online and it was
like 3 grand so I decided I'm gonna
attempt to make my own I've never done
this project I don't know if it works so
I'm not really sure if I'm gonna post
this or not but I guess if you're
watching this right now I did end up
posting it so here we go let's try
something new you guys do it yourself
Instagram chair of this project we need
some panel nails as you can see there's
nothing too interesting you're just
regular little nails are also going to
need a generic hammer umm scissors
you're also going to need some fluffy
fabric I bought 2 yards of this from
downtown it ran me about $20 super fun
gonna make a cool chair we're also going
to need some metallic spray paint
I picked silver but any color will do
this is the chair that I got at Goodwill
I picked it up for 20 bucks um and
you're the good look at this because as
you can see it's not that cute but we're
gonna make it fab so gloomy in LA today
but still pretty you know okay so
anyways we're chilling up on my roof
here and this is the chair of it we're
gonna redecorate but this is the part
that's gonna be fun we are literally
just going to take the spray paint shake
it up really good and here we go we're
gonna try this out
am I gonna get this all over my roof and
be arrested probably but whatever okay
so I'm just for the record when you're
doing this you might want to put
something down just because it will get
kind of all over the floor so be careful
oh my god it's raining hasn't rained in
LA in months why no case another started
to rain Oliver a project we have moved
underneath the little roofie area so
we're just going to continue
spray-painting it it should dry about 15
minutes also when you're doing this
don't worry we're going to reupholster
it so feel free to just spray all over
it it does not matter so go ahead get
messy spray the whole thing alright so
you know it worked I spray-painted the
whole chair and now it has a really cool
metallic looking metal finish can't
believe this it hasn't rained in like
five months we're in a massive drought
and of course today when I'm trying to
do my project it's raining all over my
chair huh maybe I should do DIY projects
every day I could like save California's
drought okay so now it's a few hours
later and the chair is all done um
drying now this is what we're gonna
reupholster it with you might recognize
this from my closet but this is the
black version this is just a giant piece
of black fabric that I got again
downtown the fabric district it was like
I think I've had $20 for this giant two
yards of it so this is what we are going
to put onto the chair like so okay so I
don't know if this makes sense but you
will literally just take the piece of
fabric and lay it on top of the chair so
you can just kind of see if like this
also you can see my news oh yours I
never have like this that I'm wearing my
bathrobe lol but um we'll just kind of
tuck it in to where the chair would
flatten it out so there we go as you can
see it's just like that kind of tuck it
into the corners and there there we go
okay so for this part you're just going
to line up the fabric with kind of where
you want it to go as you can see I've
just kind of lined it up right here and
we'll take the little nail and literally
just kind of put it in poking it through
the fabric I know it's hard to see and
then you will just hammer it in then
flip the chair upside down for easier
access for the bottom as you can see
here it is he'll just stick the nail and
Hammer that in like so
all right so as you can see this chair
is starting to look a little weird so
we're just going to take these scissors
we might recognize from other DIYs and
trim it along here so this is cut to a
length that would match this so here we
go we'll just get to trim ends it's
starting to look more and more like a
chair last but not least literally just
take this as you can see we'll want that
to look better so you'll take the giant
scissors again and you will just cut
that till about here so from here
probably snip it off here so it'll line
the bottom of this
I made them mess up my roof Italy really
looks like a bear or something has been
murdered but very good guys um so as you
can see looks pretty good I'm sorry it's
so dark I'm gonna try and lighten this
as post but I don't know if I can so I'm
gonna take it downstairs and show you
what it looks like so there we go you
guys um is this the greatest DIY project
I've ever done no but I think it came
out pretty good especially considering
it looked like trash before so there you
have it my do-it-yourself Instagram
chair
all right there you go you guys that is
how I built my little Instagram chair as
always if you have any questions
comments concerns hit me up in the
comment section below and I will attempt
to answer as many as I can also all my
socials are at Amber's also my own there
I love connecting with you um by the way
this would work for anything so if you
have any sort of thing that you want to
reupholster or any chair any table
literally spray-painted it is an easy
fix to make anything look bangin on a
budget so um oh my god you can still
trip around it's like pouring now but
anyways um thanks so much for watching
as always I love you so very much cuz
it's the next time XO I guess I came
down here in no pants oh my god so okay
so I'm just gonna go downstairs for like
I'm so embarrassing oh my god</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
