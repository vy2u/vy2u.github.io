favorite time of year Holloway what is
so you guys know that I love serving
looks and let me tell you Halloween is
no different I love to dress up and I
love costumes but of course in my
useable chief style I hate spending
money so I've been making my own
costumes for the last like ten years
I've always been a crafty little thing
um so today I thought I would show you
guys some quick easy cheap and DIY
Halloween costume ideas that will make
you be the best dressed in any room and
of course the most original so here we
go DIY Halloween style boo okay here we
go
all right so I had to take off the mask
for obvious ascetic reasons I couldn't
film the whole video with that on its
like hurting my eyes anyways I'm rested
for Halloween costumes make sure you are
getting creative get your juices flowin
because the whole point of Halloween is
to have fun so oh here we go quick easy
tips all right the best tip that I've
got is buy all one color of something
because then you can recycle it year
after year after year
get an all red jumpsuit on all black
whatever the hell this is an all-white
look granted of course these are sexier
that is my personal static for Halloween
obviously you don't need to buy freaking
lingerie but anything you want once you
have the base of all one color you can
do anything you want with it which of
course brings us to the next step
accessories buy add really cheap pair of
ears at the dollar store they literally
were 99 cents at well the 99-cent stores
oh what a shock um but literally any of
these things will dress up any outfit
you could literally wear a cami from
forever 21 and black ears and your cat
bada-bing bada-boom rabbit cool bandana
you can be at the 4th of July you can be
Minnie Mouse you can be a fairy princess
any of these things will dress up
anything super quickly alright next tip
for some reason types make anything into
a costume I don't know why but it just
has proven to be a thing so I have a
bunch of different tights I've matte
black tights
these are black fishnets white fishnets
my personal favorite um and some giant
sporty tube socks ice to wear these when
I was a cheerleader in high school Luka
woofs anyways um tights again look
fabulous slim your legs and will turn
anything into a quick costume so check
it out like okay here we go so this is
definitely a little sexy to be wearing
on YouTube kind of awkward but this is
literally a black leotard so cheap again
black um black tights and black shoes
and a little black choker and I'm going
to style it ten well probably not ten
but I'll style it a couple ways you can
see just to make our outfits you can
make with one look bunny ears and a
glove
tada you're a bunny change the ears I'm
paint your face I didn't because I don't
want to mess up my makeup and you're a
cat Minnie Mouse ears in a red belt bow
your Minnie Mouse throw in a mask and
grab a piece of fabric from Joanne's
this was like 30 cents a Dorman's and
not really sure what you are but it's
definitely sexy steal a look from a
magazine and just carry it around
honestly black dress black necktie carry
this you're good to go
and this tada I'm Kim literally a black
tube dress forever 21 $3 pro necklace
super cheap got it at the thrift store
and just throw your hair up match the
style and boom now you are that magazine
character just carried around and you
will look fabulous all night long very
original very inexpensive only I had the
ass to balance stuff on that I can't
mount champagne on my ass like this but
I'll practice maybe next year
all right so literally one of my most
popular Halloween costumes ever was this
angel look I did last year again this is
definitely on the sexier side but still
comes if you're looking for a cheap
costume this is a great idea literally a
buy some lingerie doesn't matter what
color it kind of is a double-edged sword
because you can get some nice cute stuff
that you can wear again wink wink um so
it's kind of like saving money if you
think about it I got this from H&amp;amp;M this
was like I don't know $15 and the whole
thing was like maybe 25 max I got it on
sale too um so I just got a top some
underwear and of course a little sexy
garter thinks I don't like my stomach so
I like to hide it um so you can see it
like covers that and that is an easy way
as a base for literally any costume you
want to do you can dress this up in
literally anything so all one color
lingerie is a great sexy costume idea
because you can pair it with anything to
be anything you want and if you're not
comfortable showing that much skin throw
on just a regular white dress and it
will still be just as cute easy a slutty
costume too in the world where your
bathrobe out of the house
I hope Farrah got the same laundry that
is just wearing with my angel costume
throw in a robe and bada-bing bada-boom
what are you no one knows but you look
hot as hell so no one cares again the
not sexy version of the same idea wear
pajamas grab an old oversized pajama
shirt throw in some slippers and say
you're like a teenager going to a
slumber party another great tip go
shopping in your own closet you would be
amazed at what you already have that
would make a fabulous easy costume
perhaps the cheapest easiest costume
I've ever thought of was being a store
yeah
sounds kind of weird but check it out
tada wearing my pink sweatshirt grabbed
a Victoria's Secret tote threw on some
what are these tights socks giant socks
and bhim walk around say I'm a
Victoria's Secret Angel or I guess one
of the pink girls Boas are also a super
fun way to accessorize literally
anything like this is just a boring
black outfit but now it's fabulous
carrying my Sephora bag boom i'm sephora
or i guess i'm like one of those uppity
sephora employees but either way cute
idea another fun thing get something
unique um like these ice cream socks are
so cool put them with anything say your
ice cream bada bing bada boom $5 costume
alright guys there you have it those are
my tips for easy DIY halloween costumes
um that is how I make my outfits every
year
I literally just come up with an idea
and do it so makeshift put things
together that you wouldn't think about
and just have fun because that's the
whole point of Halloween is to be
someone you're not and have a great time
while doing it and of course looking
fabulous so that being said I will see
you guys soon
