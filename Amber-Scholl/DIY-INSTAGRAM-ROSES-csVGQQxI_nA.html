okay so no one did but I did go ahead
and make these for myself because I
don't know why not I just wanted some
flowers so today I'm going to tell you
how I made my beautiful little Instagram
flower bouquet because I see them all
over the internet and they're like four
hundred dollars plus a bouquet which is
like so today I show you how I made my
very own little Instagram flower bouquet
because it was cheap easy and looks
freaking bomb like honestly this looks
better than the real ones in my humble
opinion not to mention these are gonna
last a lifetime because a flower so here
we go how I made my little Instagram
flowers
you're also gonna need some flowers I
got these downtown these are actually
really extra nice ones these are called
real touch flowers so you can feel like
they're made of something instead of
just the regular silk they're made of
like foam so they look extra super real
these are a little more expensive but
any flower will do whatever floats your
fancy you're going to need something to
cut the roses with I happen to have
these heavy-duty like clamp or scissors
but any scissors will work we're also
going to need some ribbon any color you
want and this is like some kind of foam
board thing I got this at jo-ann for
like nine dollars any sort of nice some
spray paints any color you like and
you're also going to need a circle II
craft box of wonder
aka a big cardboard Brown box if you can
find one in a color that you want that's
even better because I am going to go
ahead and spray paint this one right now
alrighty so back on the roof because
we're going to spray paint some more now
I went ahead and laid down this little
cardboard box that I also have to throw
away so it wouldn't get dirty and I'm
just going to spray paint the box black
so just go ahead shake the can and then
get the sprain
all right there we go so I spray-painted
the whole box now I'll just go ahead and
let that dry overnight and we can start
the rest of the project okay so you can
see here the stem but it's a little too
long to put them in a vase so I'm going
to go ahead and just give those a quick
little trim you don't want any of the
leaves or anything on the meter so you
can just go ahead and snip those off
super easily Oh take the tag off too lol
alright so once we got all the roses cut
we're now going to want to cut the board
to go on the inside of our beautifully
spray-painted box things by the way you
guys I'm just going to wear a glove
because I'm so tired of ruining my nails
doing all these DIYs so just going to
wear a glob on one hand anyway is not
important so we're going to take the
knife and this looks like I'm murdering
someone but I'm not anyways okay so what
we're going to want to do is cut the
foam to be able to fit onto the inside
of our little box so I'm just going to
go ahead and use the knife to cut the
plastic foam thing into a little circle
and there we go you can see I've gone
ahead and trim that off I forgot to take
the plastic off so so kind of like
attached but whatever there you go
so we'll just go ahead and do the other
side and then we can fit it on into our
box alrighty now there we go my little
circle thing as you can see it's not
perfect it doesn't have to be it doesn't
really matter at all because all we're
going to do is go ahead and put the
little circle thing inside of our box
cut off there we go
push it on down great so now this is
what we're going to go ahead and stick
the flowers into so it can all stay in
place alright so now for this literally
all you have to do is go ahead and take
the flowers and this is like easily
puncture able you can see that so all
you have to do is put the flowers into
the little foam and just push it down
into the foam so there we go one flower
in a billions ago so just keep putting
them in one by one alright so there we
go you can see I've done one row and
that's how you're going to kind of want
to do it do it circle by circle so I'll
go ahead and then fill in this circle
and the next circle and keep continuing
on until it's all filled in
there we go you can see road who is done
and now
all righty so there we go you can see
all of the roses are now sitting pretty
in the little black box last thing
you're going to do is just go ahead take
the ribbon and tie it in a pretty little
bow around the box and there we go you
guys come on your very own little
billion roses my ways you want to like
really make this fancy you can do
whatever you want you can like make all
of these red and these blue and these
black and spray-paint some of them gold
do whatever you want I'm just kind of
boring and I wanted mine to be all white
because that would match my room but
literally do anything you can put
letters like your names put an A for
your initials you can do that whatever
you want to do they look fab you can tie
a few more ribbons on there too layered
up I would crystal it if I had extra
crystals my route so there we go tada
