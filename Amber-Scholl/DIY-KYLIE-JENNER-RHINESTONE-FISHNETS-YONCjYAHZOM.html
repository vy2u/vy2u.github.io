back to my channel so first of all how
crazy is it that I just happen to have
this dress in my closet like how perfect
is this for a fishnet DIY anyways so I
guess I just gave away what we're doing
we are going to do those crystal
fishnets the Kylie Jenner was wearing in
her snapchat because I got like 2000 DMS
asking me to do it so tada here we go
crystal fishnets DIY style alrighty guys
so for this project we're going to need
a couple of things number one obviously
pick a pair of fishnets
I personally am going to do the fishnet
stocking kind of things because I just
prefer that over regular fishnets we are
also going to get some glue this is e
600 this is like industrial-strength
adhesive glue so this is good for um
gluing stuff you know
gluing stuff um these are some actually
some weird little fancy pencil things I
don't even know what these are actually
called but they help you pick up the
crystal so I'll show you that in a
second but grab yourself some of those
if you don't have these tweezers will
work just fine these just make it a
little easier and then I got three
different sizes of crystals I picked
these up downtown for two bucks these
are like little bigger these the tiniest
it means the medium size so you can
obviously just mix and match and that is
all you need to get started alright so
step one empty have a couple of the
crystals now here we go I'm going to
show you how to use this little pencil
thingy all you have to do it's really
cool is you can just kind of stick it on
top of the crystal and it'll pick it up
how does that work why does that work I
have no idea but it does so people go
ahead and get the glue out and we will
start to put them on the tights
alright so also on the same little thing
that I always use for all my projects I
will squirt a little bucket of glue a
little dollop there boom and that is
what we will use to glue um the little
sparkles onto the tights alright so here
we go first things first take out the
fishnet now you can see um if you really
stretch it out here this is what
efficient it looks like obviously no
surprise there now this is where we're
gonna want to be gluing the crystals I
can just point to it I guess with this
I'm like a teacher um where all the
little crisscross is intersect so like
right there right there right there
that is where we're going to want to be
gluing the crystals because well I mean
obviously where else we're gonna glue
them
the Brecon science people here we go
alright so then you can just go ahead
and take the crystal a dollop it in the
glue there and you can just stick it on
wherever floats your fancy OOP and there
you go
da one crystal down 70 billion to go so
go ahead just keep on going place them
all over the place there really is no
right or wrong way to do it but since we
are starting with the bigger crystals
just go ahead put them all over because
we're going to fill it in with the
little rogue crystals in just a second
you can see here I've decided to let my
hand where the glove just so I can kind
of see how the crystals would be when
they're all spread out and also an
easier tip if the crystals are giving
you troubles like they kind of are
giving me a little bit of an issue
dipping them in the glue first I'm going
to take my tweezers and dip them in the
glue and put the glue directly onto the
tight first so here we go you can see
like that boop boop boop and then I will
just go ahead and put the crystal on top
of that
and that makes it just a little bit
easier um so now we're just going to go
ahead and intersperse of the littler
crystals um throughout just trying to
give it a little dimension so again no
method to the madness here just go ahead
put them all over the place until you
get the crystally effect that you're
looking for I'll tell you right now if
you get bored easily this project is not
for you if you want to put it on your
leg while you're doing it too so that
way you can just see where the crystals
are going to go just an easier way to be
able to see what you're doing
only thing is don't put them directly on
your foot obviously because just in case
you want to wear these with shoes I
don't know whatever floats your fancy
you want to be able to not be like
stepping on them you know so I would
start probably about here and just kind
of ombre effect them up till the top
there you go you guys you can see we
have finished up our tights look at that
ooh that is pretty badass if I do say so
myself
so now just gonna go ahead and uh take a
cool picture I guess for Instagram I
also just happen to find these little
cute little satin bows that I had just
laying around my house I know my house
is so full of crafts I just happened to
have me so I'm gonna go ahead and glue
those on the top here just for a little
bit added fun and then that will be it
whew look at that you guys turn off the
lights look fantastic whoo-hoo-hoo yes
Killa Killa that is how Kylie Jenner
well she probably bought hers but if
this is how the person who made Kylie
Jenner's tights probably did it so there
are little pumpkins that is how I made
the crystal fishnets um as always I hope
you enjoyed the video and go have fun
being sexy crystally mamas
by the way guys again I know this is
like a sexy or DIY um I don't want my
channel to turn into like some weird
18-plus do-it-yourself lingerie thing so
this is probably gonna be my last sexy
DIY for a little bit but I hope you guys
enjoyed you have any questions comments
concerns as always all my socials are at
