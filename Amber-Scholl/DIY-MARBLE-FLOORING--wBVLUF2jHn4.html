back to my channel so today um since so
many of you guys love love love there's
a vanity mirror that I built um see at
the marble floor down there dumped at
all guess what I actually did that too
so I thought it'd be fun to show you
guys today how I did it because believe
it or not it was even cheaper than
making the vanity mirror and even easier
so here we go throw on your construction
hats ladies we are getting down and
dirty sorry
alright so we are going to start our
journey at Lowe's because that is where
I bought everything so here we go
alright so once you're inside you want
to head over to the flooring section
because that is where we're going to
pick up our tiles okay so now what
you're actually going to be looking for
is something called routable final which
is vinyl flooring it's not real marble
which is why it's so cheap and why you
can install it yourself and you don't
need professionals so this is what it
looks like
so as you can see it looks exactly like
real stone and stuff but uh check it out
the price is literally a dollar twenty
eight so this is my jam now these will
come in boxes like this how many are in
here probably a bajillion of them you
don't need this money depending on how
large of an area you're doing you can
just buy them one by one so feel free to
open the box like I just did
I like the customer from hell no you
really are allowed to open the box I
promise you so you can check it out this
is the ones that I personally bought
last time I was here as you can see it's
just a piece of vinyl looking marble
thing with some sticky you can pull the
back off and it's sticky underneath
which is how it will stick to your floor
so there you go pick out as many as you
need um they're 1 foot by 1 foot so you
decide how many you think would need
your room 4 is always better because
like I said they're a buck so you might
as well get a few extra all right so the
next thing you need is you're also going
to want to buy some like intense what it
looks like you would prefer someone with
that was super vulgar anyways no
basically just a really heavy duty
scissor that will cut through the tile
if need be so grab a pair of those
they're about $9 all right second place
gotta go just a generic CVS or a
Joanne's
all you need is a couple of craft
supplies so all we need from here is a
piece of white poster board
this is $0.99 and the other thing you're
going to need is some duct tape that
matches the color of your wall my walls
happen to be white so we are going to go
with white
all righty now that we're back from our
shopping trip time to get started
you don't actually need a hammer I just
wanted to look official no not on my
next camera okay anyways here we go
alrighty so this is what it looks like
um with nothing tada this was just a
little nook and cranny um in my
apartment where I had originally built a
vanity mirror but I was like you know
what this just doesn't look as luxurious
as it should so I'm gonna do something
else and I thought marble flooring would
do the trick
I was right alright now since I've
already done this part I will just do a
little extra section over here to show
you for showcase purposes um but all you
want to do is no since this is an
apartment which is why I'm going to do
this first if you don't have an
apartment and you're allowed to put
whatever you want to on the floors you
don't need to do this step but since it
is an apartment I'm going to lay this
poster board down because that is what
will protect here we'll do it over here
that is what will protect the floor from
when you put the vinyl um down on it
it's sticky so you don't really want it
sticking to whatever for the apartment
has so that's why I put this poster down
so it'll be sticking to that instead
which is also what makes it so easily
removable then you want to take the tile
now as you can see on the back is what's
just like paper and the back of it is
sticky so you can't really see but it's
sticky I promise you so you'll want to
take the paper off of that like so just
feel it right off doesn't have to be
perfect or anything and then you will
decide where you want to put the tile
I'm going to put it in the corner
because that makes the most sense and
line it up with that and put it there
the end so then all you have to do is
literally repeat the process peel the
sticky off line up another piece of tile
plunk it down and look at that it looks
great the only other thing you really
need to know is this is why I told you
to buy the scissors is in case you run
into an area where it's like this like
you can kind of see in the corner there
I had to cut up ignore the trash on my
floor you can try to cut one of the
tiles because it wouldn't all the way
fit that's why you buy the scissors so
you can cut right
the tile it's really flimsy actually you
could honestly break it if you wanted to
with your hands but the scissors give
you a nice straight edge and you can cut
it so it fits into the little areas just
like that
now obviously you would tile the rest of
it I actually didn't buy enough tiles
because I only bought enough for that
originally but anywho the third and
final step is where the duct tape comes
in I know this isn't the most
professional thing in the world but
since mine is used for pictures only you
can't really see it in real life either
as you can see this looks a little weird
to me just because I'm a perfectionist I
don't like this brown thing so I'll a
duct tape over it so it blends in so
you'll just tear off of PEEP off a piece
of duct tape that's the appropriate
length and literally just lay it down to
cover the wood so you can see it before
right here and then you can see it after
with the duct tape um as you can see I'm
not like I said I'm not a professional
no one trained to be on how to do DIY
projects but um this in my personal
opinion looks way better than the brown
so it's an optional step but I suggest
it and there you have it you guys um
this is how I built my marble floor and
literally all you have to do is pull up
the tape if you want to get rid of it
pull up the tape and you can lift the
whole thing literally right off the
floor so that is how I installed my
marble floors hell yeah that is luxury
for a apartment in Los Angeles anyway
and there you have it you guys back is
how I installed my very own marble
floors um it just looks so good I love
it
what a great idea this whole selfie
station was people made fun of me for
building it and then lo and behold they
always come over and where do we take
pictures right here but it's just slow
key shading my friends they're a little
bit anyways um thank you guys so much

questions about this I'd be happy to
answer them so uh hit me up in the
comment section below or feel free to
message me on any of my social media

whole little scenario on my Instagram
every day but anyways um I guess till
next
I'm enjoy being Bob the Builder and I
will see you very soon kids its till
next time you guys except like doesn't
