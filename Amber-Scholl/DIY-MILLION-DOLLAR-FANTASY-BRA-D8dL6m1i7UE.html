hello angels its amber to the toilet
secret super model extraordinaire I
started getting what's up guys it's
amber and welcome back to my channel so
we are making the term angels super
literally today and in honor of
Valentine's Day I thought it'd be super
fun to do a very requested DIY of my
take on the Victoria Secret million
dollar Fantasy Bra so today I'm going to
just get really extra and really sparkly
it's got to be one of my most extra DIYs
ever but um you know what it's also
hands-down one of my favorites so here
we go I can't wait to show you
DIY million dollar Fantasy Bra that was
so dramatic alright
whatever there we go also going you need
a bra and underwear obviously I think
this one I've actually from Victoria's
Secret from there like Valentine's Day
collection I just thought it was super
pretty and like scallop e and nice um
yeah I thought it would be cool for a
DIY so it's because abroad underwear
anytime will do some good old East 6000
glue I just got a brand new one
wooo fancy some tweezers that are
currently covered in e6000 clue and
you're all gonna need a bunch of
crystals but just kidding you thought
that was a bunch nobody said this is how
many I actually got is just a chain of
crystals I'll take those out of the bags
in a second I got some little jump
clasps and lobster clasps and that is
all you're going to need for this
project are you so basically all I'm
going to do is glue the crystals
directly onto the bra by putting a
generous amount of glue right onto the
cup right here and I say generous amount
because you know I mean you don't want
the crystals like flying off in the
middle of whatever you're wearing this
for it no go ahead so don't want to glue
on there and just go ahead and lay the
crystals right down onto the bra alright
so there we go it's like literally
sagging down from the weight of the
crystals it looks kind of weird but I'm
just going to let this part dry and then
I'm going to go ahead and do the same
thing to the bottom part of the bra in
the meantime I'm going to go ahead and
glue a giant crystal in the center here
because you know why not
aesthetics and then I'm just going to go
ahead and repeat the process on the
bottom
all right so there we go you can see I
went ahead and glued everything all on
there so I'm just going to let this dry
overnight so now that the bra is pretty
much done we're going to go ahead and
decorate the rest of it so here's a
couple of little mini DIYs within the
DIY it's like Inception DIY style okay
just like my DIY Joker video basically
we're just making a waist choker so like
a belt alright anyway so you're just
going to go ahead see this is going to
wrap around your waist like that and all
you're going to do is take a little jump
ring pop it open so you can see it's
open like that and then you can just
attach it onto one end by looping it
through like this you can see I just
attached that on there I'm going to put
one on the other side too so I can
lobster clasp them together whoo
Potter I forgot to mention this before
but you're also going to need some
artistic threading lyre basically just
really thin wire it's meant for crafts
you can get it at any craft store see I
also kind of wanted to add like some
little hip action on there I can't
really explain this and it doesn't make
sense when it's not on me but you can
see I just went ahead and draped some
extra crystals on there and all I did
was the same thing that I did in the
thigh chain video is basically I just
sewed the wire through the two pieces
and sew them together just like you
would with thread but you know with wire
this is the part that's going to go
around my waist it attaches with the
jump clasp together and these are the
little parts that are going to kind of
hang off my hips so again you can't
really tell what it looks like so you'll
see in a second when I put it all on so
for the bedazzled choker you look in the
shoulder chain thing I'm literally I
just went ahead and cut this to match
around measuring my neck and then I'm
just going to go ahead and wire sew this
together you can see right there you can
see the little teeny wires so I'm just
going to go ahead and sew these pieces
together and then drape them onto the
back so it can joins like a little
choker this is the part that's going to
go around my neck my body will be kind
of inside this if that makes any sense
and then this is going to drape around
my shoulders and my back so you'll see
more when I put that on but that's
basically how I did the little shoulder
chain thingy so there you go you can
kind of see it laid out a little bit
better oh my gosh looks so cool so yeah
I have the bra there I've got the top
little shoulder chain thing like I said
I'm just waiting for all this to dry but
you can see sort of what I did to the
underwear thing a little bit these
actually aren't glued on to the
underwear by the way oh this is pretty
much the finished product so now I'm
just going to go ahead
it on and pranced around oh are you guys
even ready for this I don't think you're
ready I just go think yo Rick holy shit
this is so cool
oh my god I try not to swear in my
videos but this is that's too much okay
so boom here we go we really did the
full look on this one I even pulled out
some angel wings because you know why
not I'm already being so extra I figured
I might as well just continue the
extranet so you can see the crystals
came out so cool it looks amazing on
your hips like I did with the thing it's
like so fun I got the full up with the
shoes and damn there we go that is my
fake I'm the Victoria's Secret million
dollar bra oh my god this is the coolest
thing I've ever seen so there you have
you guys that is my take on a million
dollar Fantasy Bra I hope you guys
enjoyed the video because in case you
couldn't tell I freaking love the making
this this was so fun for me so I've
always been have any questions comments
concerns all my socials are at number so
let me up on there I love you guys so
very much please enjoy being beautiful
sexy sparkly angels even though you
don't need a crystal bra to be fabulous
so I love you guys
on that note wishing you the happiest
Valentine's Day sending all my love a
million billion angel kisses my
sweethearts EXO
