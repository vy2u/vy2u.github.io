today as you can see in very rare form
Oh
my nails are a tragedy um so I'm gonna
show you guys how I do my nails at home
because it's so easy and wasting money
getting your nails done in the salon is
like a so 2001 so today I'm gonna show
you just how I do that cheap easily and
fabulously here we go all right so here
we go this is my little nail kit setup I
don't know why I'm filming this on my
bed that's kind of done but anyways um
the first thing that you're going to
need is these right here these are
acrylic tips um they're just plastic
little guys I actually got these at
Sally Beauty you can get them anywhere
you want and let's see what else do we
need your favorite nail polish colors or
and what you really need is the glue
obviously this is I also got at Sally's
is quick dry nail glue it's like three
dollars I think um and that is what you
will use to glue the nails onto your
nails so that's really basically it you
need a nail clipper and a nail file
obviously and you're good to go so let's
get started all right so we're going to
keep this short and sweet because it
really is so easy all you got to do is
as you can see the little acrylic nails
and you pick the one that looks like
third the size for your nails as you can
see your nails are different sizes these
come in different sizes
easy enough I know this one fits my
nails so here we go like as you can see
it's hard to film this with one hand but
that'll go on there pretty nicely so all
you got to do then is take the glue and
dab a little bit of it on the bottom of
the nail like this and just plop that
right on push it down to where the
cuticle is and lay it flat but oh that's
all you got to do now just press it on
there pretty good so it stays and then
you will be good to go just do the rest
of your hands and then we will get to
cutting and filing
all right there you go now that they are
all glued on now we will get to styling
them I personally like them really long
but you can do it however you want
really if you want them short if you
want them in an oval if you want them
squared literally any style that you
want you just gotta file them just like
you would your regular nails so we will
take the nail clippers just because I
mean I like them long but not like this
this is a little intense so I will just
clip them down maybe to about there all
right so now to achieve the shape that
you want this is my personal favorite
this kind of like stiletto coffin kind
of shape as you can see this is what
they look like just before so all you
have to do for that is that if this is
how you want to style them is file down
the edges off the sides like this and
then you can just file down the top like
so
and you will get this shape so go ahead
and file them into any way that you want
and then you can get to painting now
this next step is totally optional I
just personally had to do this it's kind
of my signature thing
this is Revlon Wow such an original name
Revlon red nail polish I will paint the
undersides of my nails with the red so
it kind of pops and makes my signature
nude color look a little more fun so
this is how I do that
alright so literally all I will do for
this is take the nail polish on the
screw it tada
and then I will just paint the underside
of the nails with the red polish just
like this at all doesn't have to be
perfect because you're going to paint
over the top of it anyways but just kind
of grab the bottom like so and there you
go do a couple coats if you want and
then just fill in the rest
all right so once we got that step in
check if you do decide to do it go ahead
and then just take your favorite nail
polish color this one is my personal
fave this is Sally Hansen totally yours
it's the miracle gel you until I take
great care of my new anyways um so this
one it will just lasts longer than
regular nail polish
um but pick any color you want and paint
it right onto your nails just like you
would your regular fingernails tada
so once you've painted that on you're
pretty much good to go as you can see it
looks frickin awesome it's so
professional so nice um and then all
you'll do is take a topcoat um paint
that on there just to make it last
longer this again is the gel manicure
topcoat nothing too special but I like
to use that and that is all you do and
then you have your perfectly manicured
claws with a fun little pop of color
into nice so there you have it you guys
that is how I do my nails at home in the
comfort of my bedroom in like 15 minutes
um and like I said it is so much cheaper
than getting your nails done in the
salon and way easier and to be honest
low-key looks better so I mean that's
just my personal opinion but see if any
of you questions about what I just did
or just want to say hi all my social
media is at Universal and of course

have anything you want to say and I'll

very much kisses till next time
