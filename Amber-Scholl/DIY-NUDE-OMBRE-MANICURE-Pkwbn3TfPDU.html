welcome back to my channel so today um I
was just in totally just in a mood which
is why I'm wearing this literally no
other reason than that it's like hot in
LA right now but anyways um I'm going to
answer the commonly asked question video
requests which of how I do my new nude
shade of rosy gold nails so did I'm
going to show you how I do it because
it's super simple so here we go guys how
I get that rosy gold nail glow all right
this is gonna be like the quickest DIY
ever but um you guys already know I do
my own nails but ah they look terrible
today but um that is why we're going to
do this if you want to see how I
actually do them there's another video
that doesn't really in-depth because II
this is what I buy just buy the nail
tips from Sally's little wands my nails
I'm using some regular old nail glue
super-easy takes only a few minutes just
file them down to the size that I like
bada-bing bada-boom and we are set to go
so now we will start painting them
because that's what this whole tutorial
is about like I said if you want to see
the whole thing in depth you can see
that on my other video over now here we
go flash-forward version um let's get
started to painting alright so now that
we've got our nails all done um this is
the nail polish that I use for this look
this is two bucks at CVS wet-and-wild
megalast and what color is this oh here
we go private viewing um it's great I
love it it's super cute it's like a nude
it's shade so then I will just get to
painting alright so I meant it when I
said there's literally nothing special
about painting your nails here we're
just going to take it and we're going to
do one regular coat on the nails so here
we go so I'm just going to paint them
once over not double layering it just
one time Boop and then I'll do that on
every nail
all right
so there we go that is layer one as you
can see that pretty much looks dang
perfect oops
as I mess it up okay so what comes next
is we're just going to make this for the
ombre effect is we are going to paint
kind of where you can see the Halfmoon
there starts I'm just going to paint up
to there one more time as the double
layer check it out
and that keeps it thin without messing
up the ombre effect
you
mm there you go you can see you have
that kind of nice nude ombre effect
there so I'm just going to paint the
other hand and then we'll do the top
coat this is my favorite top coat this
is Sally Hansen miracle gel in color top
coat lol but it's fabulous I got it at
CVS for like 10 bucks I think so it's
kind of pricey for just a drugstore
topcoat um compared to the wet and wild
two dollar one but this one is the best
it lasts forever and really gives it
that like professional look to it so
then all I will do is paint that right
onto my nails and we will be done done
tada
whoosh oh yeah look at that yes honey
also I'm so weird and will literally dry
my nails with my trusty little fan that
I've got in my room this works really
great quick easy way to dry your nails
just hold them in front of their for 30
seconds and you'll be good to go and
there you go you guys that is how I do
my little nude claw manicure fabulous
looks cute fun little budget way um to
do your nails where you have it precious
babycakes um that is how I do my little
rosy gold nails um I hope you loved the
