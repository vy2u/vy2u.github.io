wear red lipstick because I feel like it
looks weird on camera and to be honest I
feel like it still looks kind of weird
but anyways so what's up guys
amber and welcome back to my channel so
today I thought it would be super fun to
kind of hop on the embroidery
embellished rein and honor of New York
Fashion Week and do a little bit of
do-it-yourself designer duds so today
we're going to take you from one of my
favorite designers ever don't get
Gabbana and kind of do a little
embellished embroidered skirt so here we
go
my very own DIY embellished embroidered
fancy designer skirt I really need to
work on my intros are always so weird
okay here we go
alrighty so for this project really all
you're going to need is a couple of
things a you're obviously going to need
some nice embroidery I got these these
are like little iron-on roses that I got
downtown Los Angeles I'm just one of the
little street vendors they were like two
bucks each also going to need some
tweezers you can see minor girls and
covered in a six thousand glue and even
my e6000 glue I like glue to feather on
to it it's just okay it's a mess but
anyways you need some glue and of course
you're going to need some crystals for
this one just because I mean you know
it's me how am I going to make a DIY
without some crystals got those downtown
too you're also going to need whatever
it is you want to decorate I personally
take this black skirt I got to sit
forever 21 it's like being in leather it
was really cheap is like 15 bucks I
think so that is what I'm going to
embroider and make fabulous mm-hmm just
wait little bunny or gonna be amazing
okay here we go
alright so this project is really a
free-for-all basically all you're going
to want to do is put everything wherever
you want it to go I'm going to go ahead
and start by embellishing the top just
because I don't know I think that would
be like freaking fabulous looking so all
you have to do is take the glue and put
it right onto the skirt and then just
lay the crystals right onto the glue and
we will stick and look fabulous alright
there we go you can see I went ahead and
glued that on there don't worry about it
being messed up because I'm going to do
lots of layers so there we go we'll just
go ahead and do the next one
alright now we've got the first little
world crystals I also want to get a
little pocket looking things I'm just
going to lay some crystals on the pocket
because you know that'll just really amp
it up more fanciful actually change of
plans I'm going to go ahead and lay down
the embroidery how I want it first so
for this all that I did was literally
pick these up and went ahead and laid
them down like plop you know design them
put it wherever you want I'm going to
put mine right here and right here to
mirror them and I layered them on top of
each other just to you know give it a
little bit more dimension so there we go
you can see them like that and now I'm
going to do is glue them right on in
place alright there we go now that I
have those all laid on there and drying
I'm going to go ahead and put some
crystals on the bottom two just to kind
of match the top so same thing as before
glue it on lay it on bada-bing bada-boom
done
all righty so there we go now it's all
crystal up now finally we're going to go
back to what I said in the very
beginning I'm gonna add a little pocket
embroidery crystal things go ahead clue
that press it down and huzzah skirt is
all done I let it dry overnight and oh
my gosh it looks literally so good look
at it sparkling in the life like so I
actually got some extra crystals too so
I went ahead and made a choker out of it
you can see how I do that in my children
video but oh look at this I'm just going
to go ahead and put it on I do a little
fashion show for you and you can see how
cute it came out it's so sparkly and
looks great I really like did the whole
outfit up with them
my little DIY booties so cute with the
gold on the back and then you can see
the skirt up close is so sparkly the
embroidery looks so good and my little
choker thing came out pretty good like
you can see that so sparkly there with
my ring and I am just surviving
