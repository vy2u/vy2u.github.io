anyone else out there hey guys it's
amber welcome back to my channel so
first of all sorry we're not in my room
today it's because it is literally mess
I'm in the middle of like 80 to do it
yourself and yeah I was too lazy to
clean it before I started to film this
video so we're just gonna do to my
living room instead anyways um I had
mentioned in my how to make cheap
clothes look expensive video that I
actually ripped my own pair of jeans I'm
the one that I was wearing with like the
white tank top thing and I got so many
questions about them holy cannoli SH but
only below me
that doesn't make any sense I don't even
think that's an expression but now it is
because I made it up anyways um today
I'm going to show you how to wreck your
own denim because it's so stinkin easy I
actually learn from a YouTube video
myself so I'm going to show you how to
do it because I promise you you can do
it too so here we go do-it-yourself
ripped denim style
all right back at it again with the
super easy DIY is you only need two
things for this you need some scissors
and you need some tweezers which
apparently are my favorite tool we use
them in everything and that is it just
kidding I almost forgot you definitely
obviously need some denim to rip so just
pick your favorite denim and we will get
to tearing it up literally here we go
I'm weird and personally like to put the
jeans on when I'm doing it because then
I can see exactly where the rips are
going to be it's all you're going to do
is kind of draw where you're going to
want to cut the jeans it's just going to
be a quick little horizontal line super
easy nothing too drastic doesn't have to
be perfect not even close after you drop
a little line take the jeans off just so
you don't cut yourself and we're just
going to cut right across here into
little horizontal lines like that okay
so there you go you can see we got the
nice little slits they don't have to be
perfect at all but you can see we got
kind of one area here and one area here
and this is how we're going to make the
holes look like this okay so here we go
you can see where we've cut the two
lines and now all you're going to do is
take your tweezers and see the little
blue threads Boop you're going to pull
the blue threads away from the white
ones which are actually running
horizontal which you can't really see
but all you got to do is take them and
instead of tweezing your eyebrows we're
gonna twist the parents don't give you a
little bit of a better close-up here so
you can see but yeah these little blue
threads that are sticking out literally
just pull on them with the tweezers and
they'll come right out boom boom boom it
will eventually start to look like that
distressed denim look right here you can
see it's starting to get a little bit
more messed up so then just keep doing
in math areas keep pulling the little
pieces out you can pull in the little
white ones too if you want and you will
have your distressed look in no time
okay so there you go it's getting a
little more distressed now as you can
see I've just cut a circle these are the
genes that I was wearing in the other
video and I want them to be really
distressed so I literally just take the
scissors and just cut a hole like this
bum bum bum bum and cut around boop boop
boop toss that and then we will just
pull out at the little seams right here
to give it a more distressed look
whoo so as you can see I've literally
just plucked them to death I'm closing
about ripping jeans is you're already
messing them up so it's impossible to
mess it up literally just do whatever
you think will look good
there's no way to ruin it so just mess
around with it have fun and see what you
can come up with there you go you can
see we're getting closer pretty much did
up this side pretty good it's not fully
done yet but then same thing with this
you can just cut holes in it you don't
even need to mark it you can just cut
however you want and then just get to
pulling on it again to mess it up a
little and then of the only steps you
guys have to do and then just do them as
much as you want or as little as you
want you can do a bunch of little holes
you can do a bunch of big holes it's
however you float your boat I'm gonna do
this this excuse me a pickup this
particular tutorial so they're like
completely distressed but it's up to you
just do whatever you want to your jeans
total whoo my thighs are doing that
thing when you sit anyways
I also recommend putting them on your
leg while you're in the middle of it
just to kind of see what you're doing so
like as you can see this looks pretty
good but yes I do have one on and one
not this looks good gonna want to rip
this up a little more and maybe put some
extra holes here just so you can see
what you want to do while you're doing
it you can just keep cutting rake random
holes here and there match them up with
the stresses already in there and then
just keep kind of plucking at them like
I said there's no way to mess this up
because the whole project is messing it
up so you can do literally whatever you
want to do then just go ahead and trim
off the extra gene fuzzies I'm you can
see like this piece is so long so just
snip snip snip and you'll be good to go
whoo okay so I think that's enough
cutting for now um as you can see
they're pretty much all destroyed rub it
off a little bit and my roommate's are
gonna kill me
that's my butt but you know hey what can
you do I literally made a trail all over
the place anyways then we're done
cutting them just throw them in the wash
and then when you take them out of the
wash and dryer they should be distressed
and looking fabulous as ever look at
that
yeah nailed it baby cakes you nailed it
by the way these shoes could you just
die at them oh I thought for the denim
spirit it'd be great I got him at Lola's
of course so fun so cute
so there you have you guys that is how I
rip my own denim as always if you have
