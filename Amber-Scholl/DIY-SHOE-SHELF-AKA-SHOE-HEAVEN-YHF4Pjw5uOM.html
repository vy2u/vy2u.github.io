welcome back to my channel so today umm
today first of all my hair looks loke
like I've been electrocuted because I
was just outside and like it was raining
and you know what can you do so weird it
never rains
anyways I'm not gonna complain about it
right now because I already complained
right out of my snapchat so point is
today I'm gonna stay inside and I'm
gonna show you guys how I built my very
own little tumblr shoe rack inspired a
gold closet type thing because it's so
stinkin cute and was literally I think
grand total was $40 so despite the fact
that I'm probably the worst construction
person in the world here's how I did it
so the first thing you're going to need
for this project is this is a lack shelf
from Ikea it's just an infinity floating
wall shelf it looks like this I got it
in white but they have a couple other
colors too now this shelf comes with
these little whatever these are I've
read the directions yet so I'm not sure
what we're gonna do with them but it
comes with those and it also comes with
this so no need to worry about buying
those things it all comes as one this
was like $14.99 we're also gonna need a
couple of generic wall screws of course
a handy measuring tape grab yourself a
hammer too and a screwdriver we're also
going to need this bedazzled placemat no
I'm totally getting I just wanted to
show this off because I just got it from
home goods the other day oh my god it's
beautiful
you don't need this for this project
though but it just deserved its little
moment
anyways okay back to the project alright
so I personally find instruction manuals
for my Kea to be extremely confusing so
we're gonna kind of follow this but
mostly I'm just gonna do whatever I feel
like so take that with a grain of salt
um but here we go let's get started
alrighty so here we go you can see this
is my plain bedroom wall that has
literally nothing on it so I thought it
would be fun to spice it up with one of
those like beautiful tumblr Instagram
walls of shoes because I don't know why
not live in a Nordstrom so this is what
I have decided to decorate so let's uh
get to hang in the shelves alrighty so
I'm standing our chair for the purposes
of this demonstration so if I fall to my
death at any point during this I'm
wasted on doing what I love building
shelves no I shoes though anyways
alright so what we're going to do for
this is you're going to want to screw
this onto the wall so as you can see
I've already
one of the shelves actually two of the
shelves but whatever um so this is gonna
want to be hung up right again above
them like so now I've always been one
for eyeballing things yeah even with
construction projects I know that's not
really the greatest idea but that's just
how I roll so if you want to be
proficient you can go ahead and measure
it and make little ticks on the wall you
know with a tape bla bla you're gonna
want to have three screws in there but I
for one I'm just gonna be like alright
that looks decently good keep an eye on
that spot and I'm just going to go ahead
and nail a screw right into that spot
cut off there we go now I have one lone
nail semi not even a little bit screwed
into the wall but that's just so I can
have a placement so like I said that was
purely for placement purposes so I'll
just go ahead and take the screw out of
the wall and then it also comes with a
couple of brackets you're gonna want to
go ahead and then but to push the screw
through the brackets I know this doesn't
make much sense right now but just work
with me people it's gonna make sense in
a second alright so here we go so you
can see how it's a little hole in the
wall now I'm gonna go ahead and you can
see I have placed this onto the little
area with the hole right there and then
I'm going to go ahead and manually screw
that in with the screwdriver alright so
there you go you can see I went ahead
and just screwed that in there now one
screw actually is enough to hold the
whole thing but obviously uh not with a
shelf on it and especially because my
shoes weigh a lot because I have so many
so we're just gonna go ahead and go
ahead and continue make little hole
right there with the nail go ahead and
make one right there and then another
one I just like to put forward to be
extra secure so I'm going to go ahead
and do that
so you can see I have finished screwing
in all the little screws and now I'm
just gonna go ahead and place the shelf
onto the little o like I said I don't
know what this is but onto this thing
all right here we go
so this is the shelf apologies I'm kind
of far away I'm like literally standing
on a chair and trying not to die but you
can see the Shelf has a little
indentation in there and that is where
we're going to go ahead and slip it
right on to the Shelf thing so here we
go
trial and error it's not too difficult
you guys all you got to do is kind of
place it on there and it will get on
there I think great tah excellent ik cha
cha cha cha cha
alright so if we come down off the
stairs you can see the shelf look in
pretty good if I do say so myself
now all that's left to do is you can see
there's little holes I'm in the bottom
of this I do not know why those are
there but according to the directions
um this it comes with this by the way
it's supposed to go in there and you
just have to screw it into place and
you're just gonna go ahead and use this
little thing is kind of a crank and just
kind of crank it twisting this thing
until it eventually will get all the way
into the board so there you go you can
see they are all screwed in now and
oh no those soya Tecla back to cos
gallery but there we go okay so you can
see they are all hung up and now I'm
just going to go ahead and put my shoes
on them so it looks a little more
glamorous than just free weird white
planks sticking out of my wall tada
so there you have it you guys that is a
my finished little shoe rack it looks so
stinking good oh my god I'm obsessed
with it and now all my shoes get to sit
pretty on their rightful throne oh look
at them yes I have like a literal shoe
addiction these are all dupes by the way
um so I will do another designer shoe
dupes video because I already have one
up here but like who you all know shoes
are my thing so there you have that
