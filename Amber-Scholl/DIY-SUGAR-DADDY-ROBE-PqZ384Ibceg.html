shocked my husband passed away of
mysterious circumstances I just I don't
even know what to say he was such a good
man wonder whatever could have happened
to him what's up guys it's amber and
welcome back to my channel so today
obviously that was just a joke but we
are going to be making these awesome
venery tumblr esque sex and later robes
because I saw these online and so many
of you guys did - I get like 30 DM today
requesting these this specific DIY so
today I thought I would make my own
little feathery tumblr row because the
actual retail price of these is like 450
bucks which is really really steep so I
thought I would make my own and this one
in total costs like forty dollars so
today I'm going to show you how to do it
so here we go DIY sexist shove it at it
killin rope guys first thing you're
going to need is some needle and some
thread I'm using black thread because my
robe is black so get some that matches
your robe this looks really funny but
next thing you're going to need is a
robe as you can see this one is like a
mesh silky bathrobe looking thing um
it's actually technically a duster coat
but I got this one from a site called
posh cult and it was like 35 dollars so
this is a the robe that we are going to
feather up so obviously you're going to
need some feathers these are a black boa
that I got downtown I got three of them
just because I wanted to make sure I had
plenty so grab some feather boas
whatever color you like and we can get
to feather izing band last but not least
you're gonna need a piece of ribbon I
also got this downtown it was like 50
Cent's so tada there we go that's all we
need and we can get started
alrighty so in case you haven't seen it
these are the robes now as you can see
the feathers on here are around the
cuffs around the bottom and lined up a
little bit around the neckline so that
is what I'm gonna do to this robe so you
can see like I said I just bought the
meshy robe from that website please
don't fall down but okay anyways so I'm
going to just go ahead and mirror the
mirror of the picture and put the
feathers all around the cuffs and around
the neckline and around the bottom of
the robe
so here we
let's uh just get to storing by the way
I'm sorry there's just like caramel
popcorn and whatnot in the middle of my
do craft station it's the holidays so
anyways I'm just gonna take the little
fuzzy thing and put that right there and
then I'm just gonna literally sew it on
like so so I'm like so uh haha okay
alright so just in case you've never
stolen anything before all you got to do
is thread the needle tada
great you can pull it through again
everything is so difficult with my long
nails but you make it work you know
looking fabulous is worth the extra
effort my momma actually taught me this
trick if you take the end of the string
and just kind of wrap it around your
finger a few times like this and then
you just kind of rub rub it off like
this and then pull on it like so tada
you're going to have a knot that is now
tied and not going anywhere so it's not
really the most aesthetically pleasing
thing but this is a great way to not
have to spend 300 hours tying a knot so
then there you go you're ready and we
can start sewing okay so this is all
we're going to do for this now you can't
really tell but there's like a hard
thing in the middle of this and that is
what we're going to be sticking the
needle through so stick that right
through the center of the boa and pull
the knot through sand probably just
going to want to do one or two little
knots there to make sure it sticks and
then there you go it is attached
perfectly easily to the atop so then you
will just go ahead and sew it all the
way down
by the way you don't have to like sew it
like hmm right next to each other you
can kind of spread it out like you can
see I have a stitch here and then my
next stitch I'll probably just do over
here so it's far away by the way look at
this my nails come such in handy as a
thimble so that's cool they do come in
handy once in a while alright there was
just absolutely not enough room in my on
my normal craft table to show you guys
this so you can see I've done half of
the robe there I sewed it all the way
down and then curled it along on the
back edge of the robe so now I will just
go ahead and repeat the process on the
other side until it's all fluffed up
alright guys so now we're just going to
go ahead and sew it around um little arm
whole thing so just gonna take the
little fluff egde and literally do the
exact same thing I already did maybe you
might want to cut it first just so
you're not dealing with like a pounds of
fluff so go ahead measure that around
there we go so you can just go ahead
trim that tada
already alright here we go so if you lay
the robe out flat um again I know it's
just a mess but you can see this robe
already has like this is the lace tie
around um little string thing so I'm
gonna go ahead and take the ribbon and
I'm just going to go ahead and lay it on
both sides are shiny so it doesn't
really matter but I'm just going to go
ahead and sew it swell there's like make
a little stitch here here and here just
so this part can fall off and then we
can tie it into a bow around the front
like there you go you can kind of see I
just made like little tiny stitches in
there and then tied it around the back
um again hard to see but basically
that's all I did I just attached it on
the side of the center and the other
side so now we can go ahead and put it
on because this looks really bad but I
promise it's gonna look cool once it's
on me whoosh I don't know why I did that
okay alright and tada you guys I paired
it with these feathery shoes that I got
from public desire so you can check
those out but look at this look at this
this looks so good like honestly this
one looks better than the ones that you
can buy I love it like I said you can
customize this look at whatever color
robe you want you can do whatever color
fluff whatever cover color ribbon and
you're gonna look bang it babycakes whoa
so fun so fun
so fun so there you happy you guys I
hope you enjoyed the tutorial because oh

funnest things I've ever made umm as
