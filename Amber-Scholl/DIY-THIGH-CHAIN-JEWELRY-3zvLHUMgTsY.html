let's have you guys it's amber and
welcome back to my channel so in case
you couldn't guess by my excessive
glitterati look already we're going to
be doing some more Krystal DIYs on my
channel today so we're gonna jump right
in with some crystal thigh jewelry
because I saw it on Instagram it was
dying over it so here we go a DIY
crystal thigh oh my god it almost
arrived by jewelry okay it doesn't rhyme
anymore
but what can you do okay here we go
already kiddos so for this project we
need the exact same things that we need
for any of my other crystal tutorials we
are going to need this beautiful crystal
chain wow glowing in the morning light
this is unbelievable is this not an
aesthetic or what ok anywho Z we need
some of that we need some artistic wire
which is well it's this right here we
also need some scissors just generic
scissors will do and grab your favorite
pair of tweezers I just got these gold
ones they're pretty bangin and then last
but not least we will need some lobster
lobster clasps with the conjoining rings
and that is all we need to make a
fabulous dad jewelry rock on Oh okay
let's get started
alrighty so first step is going to be
trimming up the crystals so what you're
gonna want to do first is take a piece
and wrap it around your waist that's
going to be the waistband for it the
thigh thingamajig that we're making um
then you're gonna want to make the thigh
garters so wrap them around your thigh
you can put them as high or as low as
you want I'm gonna want mine to go right
about here I think so
whatever floats your fancy and then we
are going to put one that are going to
be the connectors of the waistband to
the thigh thing so you're going to take
it and just measure it into the little
connecting pieces you'll want four of
those so just trim him and you'll be
good to start the craft
alright muffin so what you're gonna want
to do first is you're going to take the
piece that you wrapped around your
midsection because that is the part that
you're going to want to be able to open
and close to take on and off so you will
take one edge of it and one of the
little lobster clasps you can see right
here I've actually applied it open a
little bit so you can see there's a
break in it and all you're going to do
is loop it on then you will also loop
one on to the other side and then you
will slip one of the lobster clasp then
on to the little ring like that there we
go and you will just close that up so
then you have the midsection body chain
available to be closed and you can see
this is what's going to go around your
midsection and be kind of the base of
the chain alrighty so this is where the
wire comes in as you can see it's called
artistic wire it basically looks like a
spool of thread with them but you know
made of wire so basically what we're
going to do to connect um the little
thigh circles together I don't know what
else to call them both side thigh
circles we were going to want to put
this end and this end together now
usually I would say just superglue it
but that actually doesn't work so
instead we are going to use this thread
to virtually
so them together right so what you're
going to do is take the little wire once
you've cut a little piece of it I know
this is hard to see but you will just
loop it through right here tada and then
you can connect this end to that end by
connecting it through this other wire
like I said it's like virtual sewing
take this piece like this buh-bam and
there we go now you can see they are
sort of close together so then you can
just go ahead and tie a little knot
twist it so there you go you can see
they're connected um obviously do it a
few times to make sure that they're
actually going to steaks you don't want
it popping off in the middle of whatever
you're doing wearing these for anyways
that's your business but so you're going
to want to just make sure it's very
secure and then we will make the other
ones I'm going to lay it out for you so
you can kind of get a better idea of
what we're doing so this is the main
waistband and these are the two little v
bands that we cut and these are we're
going to go in the front and the back to
kind of connect at all so if you can
imagine this is where your legs gonna go
oops there goes my ring and this is
where your other leg is going to go I'll
show you in a second so it makes more
sense but basically what we're going to
do now is then go ahead and connect
these pieces to each other so we'll
connect it on the front and on the front
to this and then of course we'll do the
backend too we will connect this one to
that one and this one to that one in the
front one in the back so you can have
two ways of being secured
all right you guys there we go the top
of it the little strings at the bottom
and the little thigh cuffs so I'm gonna
put this on so you can understand what
I'm saying but there we go it's Oh done
all right here we go fashion show time
there you have it ladies you can see
what it looks like with the crystal bra
and everything all matching matching
super fun um you can wear it under a
dress or wear it under whatever you want
this is it a little surprise for your
special someone or you know if you're
like me just wear it for fun because
it's cool and why not feel fabulous all
the time even if it's just for yourself
that's what life is all about having fun
and looking great doing it so we have
you guys that is how I made my little
DIY thigh jewelry and crystal brush and
anagen I hope you enjoyed the video and
