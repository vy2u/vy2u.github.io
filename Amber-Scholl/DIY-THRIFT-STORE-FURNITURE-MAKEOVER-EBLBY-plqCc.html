to video number six hundred thousand
million where it looks like I am naked
in the intro but of course for the usual
I'm not naked in fact we're wearing a
very cute little getup today a very nice
little plaid because you know plaid
construction kinda no okay anyhoo Z what
is up you guys
it's amber welcome back to my channel
and today we're gonna do a nice little
construction project you guys know I
love thrift shopping and I love DIY
projects and I've done plenty of fashion
videos combining the two but I thought
today would be fun to give it a little
twist and do it with furniture I have no
idea what we're really doing because I
haven't been to the thrift store yet so
I don't know what exists but basically
we're gonna do a little furniture DIY
makeover project it seems we can take a
drab piece of furniture and make it a
bad piece of furniture so without
further ado here we go DIY mystery
restore her furniture makeover rug bitch
style of course
Oh ready so today we've got a very sexy
lumberjack vibe going on so uh here we
go outfit of the day
a little strapless red flannel dress
that I got on eBay as for shoes I really
got to get a better mirror for this but
whoo fussy little Oxford pumps with some
black socks catch the logo there first
but ah yes sunglasses very long straight
locks and of course my little purse so
let's our outfit of the day to go
birthday so let's see what we can find
lumberjack daddy yo okay
I was literally so weird alright alright
so like I said I have no really clue
what we're gonna get but uh we're
heading into Goodwill to see what they
cooked all righty let's see whoa whoa so
many things Wow honestly there's so much
stuff that could be really really fun
like a couch I'll do that at some point
but today I think I kind of want to do a
table or something maybe that oh you
know that actually is fun on its own hmm
okay what shall we do one of these no
there's so many options
I like genuinely love first doors this
is so fun the creativity is endless um
okay Wow is this a sign that this is
just randomly right here this
is awesome and look at that $14.99 by
the way did you guys notice my broken
nail ah so sad I need to fix that later
but um I think I'm sold well I don't
think that is actually goes to fit we're
gonna call it over all righty
so we're gonna hit up Lowe's next
because oh and I just realized this if
the exit oh but it opens anyway okay
great so we're gonna go to pick up all
the rest of the stuff that we need to
decorate the table like you can see
there's actually nothing on the table so
OOP that's not gonna work we need to put
something on it
so we're gonna hit up the hardware
section and get some glass okay so what
we ended up finding was this little
piece of acrylic so they are just going
to measure it and cut it right for me so
easy I don't even have to do anything oh
my goodness wow this is so dramatic look
at this you guys okay we actually need
to get some spray paint so I don't know
why I'm doing this but I always just
thought these were so beautiful as a kid
so any hoozy all right to the paint or
ID the forbidden spray paints what color
are we gonna make this table you guys
alright could I have that one yeah yeah
all right kids we got all the goods see
more interesting if we keep having
guests so here we go lovely gentleman
who got me to spray paint so alright
we've got these little fuzzy pad things
we've got some spray paint we got the
guest of honor and some arbol contacts
pavers Allah that'll be that ready to go
alrighty we're getting know the goods
getting this into my apartment ended up
being such a struggle so shadow talk the
uber driver and all the kind strangers
at my neighbor who helped me you guys
are the best
good morning kids it is officially the
next morning how funny I went from like
looking half-naked and I wearing a
turtleneck so weird I don't know if I
like the way turtlenecks look on camera
but you know it's fine we're gonna film
anyway so are you ready to see what we
got towards this project
mmm it's outside let's show you them
so ignore that but um the table that we
got to DIY voila it's actually such a
stinkin cool table I am so excited to do
it so there we go here's his before and
does it so loud we're gonna go ahead and
film the rest of this inside so here we
go
transporting again alright decorate the
table here's what we got
alrighty so to decorate the table you
guys remember I was just in Lowe's I got
this piece of like acrylic glass to
cover the table so it you know has glass
on it and it's usable we also of course
got the marbled contact paper because
this is just always fun I love using
this for crafts so I'm not sure what
we're gonna do with that but we're gonna
figure it out um what else oh the most
important part of this project we got
some metallic spray paint we got two
just in case we also got these little
felt pad thingies to you know do
whatever these felt pad thingies are
supposed to do and then last but not
least I'm tired of doing all my crafts
on my rug and ruining it so we got this
little canvas drop cloth thing which I
think it's just like a giant blanket so
we'll see what that is in a second oh
yes this is really fun you can see just
now I'm not actually working I'm rarely
wearing pants when I film my videos but
you know whatever mm-hmm and that's
literally it
honestly this project is gonna be really
easy so here we go let's get started so
here you can see the before of the table
so first things first what we're gonna
do is lay down the little canvas things
so we have an area to work on without
you know rotating the floor like I
usually do then we're gonna flip the
table upside down so we could more
easily spray painted it looks kind of
like I killed it but that's okay um so
first of course we have to clean it so I
got some Clorox disinfecting wipes and a
little dust rag that I'm just gonna wipe
it all off with umm there's definitely
more dramatic ways you can clean things
but to be honest I'm a little lazy plus
it's disgusting and I don't love
cleaning so you grab another glove if
you want don't know why I grabbed one
after I cleaned it but you know better
late than never
so then all we're gonna do is grab the
spray paint and then you can literally
just spray right onto the table no my
mariza
just kind of go hand and you can see
eventually it will be all sprayed after
that dries for about 15 minutes you can
go ahead flip them over you can see it's
our equal
on the bottom look and fancy looking
good you don't have to do this but for
the top I'm going to go ahead and use a
primer just so it looks extra fancy fab
so we went ahead and put spray paint
primer all over the top let that dry for
about five minutes and then again of
course you spray the gold right back
onto there again you should probably
wear a mask for this because after
smelling it for a while you'll start to
feel kind of funny I'm kidding but
actually though wear a mask already and
now you can see it's all spray-painted
but at this point in the project I
decided I wanted a little bit more up so
actually what the Michaels in the middle
of this and bust more gold sparkly stuff
but ended up not liking it and didn't
even use it but while I was there I did
also stop at Marshall Sansa got totally
sidetracked and bought some killer
Rose oh my God look at this are you
kidding me 2007 bee is living the
project so now we're just gonna go ahead
and take the marble contact paper and
you can see the area where I didn't
really spray as much we're just gonna go
ahead and lay that right on there you
can see it's kind of like a sticker so
you just peel off the back end and you
can just straight on stick it right on
to the table take a little blade cutter
or a razor and you could just cut right
along where you want the edge to be and
we'll up now it's marbled so go ahead do
that all around until the marbling is
completed last but not least take your
little felt pads and cut them so they
match the bottom of the furniture
plop those on the bottom so it doesn't
scratch your floor and the actual last
but not least we're gonna go ahead and
take the little piece of acrylic glass
thing and peel off the plastic then you
can go ahead and lay that piece of glass
right on top by the big butt
oh my goodness you can see the table
came out so stinking good it literally
looks so magnificent and regal you would
never know it costs $14 from thrift shop
oh goodness what even this looks amazing
you can see the gold finishing just look
so pretty and then of course we've got
the fabulous marble looking all on fleek
frozen pretty flower arrangements on
there with your favorite magazines and a
little fashion book and we're done voila
literally such an easy fun DIY project
to add glam to any space oh can you hear
my voice is so stuffy oh my god oh when
I dusted that thing off I accidentally
breathed in a giant chunk of dust and
like let me tell you I've been sneezing
for the last like eight hours so for a
future reference make sure you wear a
mask when you're doing this but you know
you live and you learn
