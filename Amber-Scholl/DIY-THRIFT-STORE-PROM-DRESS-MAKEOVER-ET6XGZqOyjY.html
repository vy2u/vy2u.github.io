I honestly have no idea why I did that
but anyways after you guys it's amber
welcome back to my channel and if you're
new hello greetings welcome to the party
so today we're gonna do a little prom
theme DIY a bunch of you guys have been
asking me to do something for the prom
season though I thought it would be fun
to kind of take your suggestions and go
to a thrift shop and give address kind
of like a DIY prom makeup er because
it's fun to be creative and you don't
need to break the bank to look fab so
without further ado here we go
DIY thrift store prom dress oh wait
before we go in here is our outfit of
the day it is really weird today I like
don't even know what I'm wearing but
also it's you anyways because you know I
always do so we've just got an oversized
white t-shirt dress because I wanted to
keep it very very casual you know try it
on a bunch of stuff gotta be cozy a long
Pony a headband because I've been really
into headbands lately I don't know why
so nice jewelry first I just what yay
that's basically it because I'm not
wearing pants I mean I got like shorts
underneath but that's basically it so
voila that's over your outfit of the day
on widow alrighty here we go let's see
what we can find
hmm alrighty we gotta find the dress
section which I believe is over there so
we'll go over there okay so I don't
really know exactly what we're looking
for I'm just gonna see whatever catches
my eye that I think I could make
fabulous or any of these mm-hmm maybe
hmm maybe hmm actually yeah this could
work both go between this one and this
one but I think we're gonna go with this
one mostly because it's half off and I
think I can make this one cuter alrighty
we got the guts now off to visit
Benjamin and tada
you look groovy today okay so um I don't
really know what I need today but we're
making over like a prom dress
any ideas it looks like you have maybe
60,000 things I could use so alrighty
let's find some alrighty so how can we
decorate you hmm this could be fun
Oh beautiful mmm so many options of
things I don't even know it's a kid
where do I start
hmm hmm I don't know what this is but I
need to use this already don't really
know what I'm gonna do with these but
this is going to be the winners thank
you see you soon bye
alrighty we got both of the goods oh
okay all right
Santa's here y'all ready to see what we
got here we go inside the bag this is
the dress that we bought from the thrift
store not so beautiful right now but it
will be beautiful soon then for a
Benjamin of course we got these two
things that I need to open because you
can barely tell what they are but I
picked up this beautiful sheet of
crystal mesh Oh beautiful then this
thing looks evil but I also got this big
long basically a big feather fabric
sheet so you'll see what I'm gonna do
with that in a minute but uh yeah
basically that's that oh you're also
gonna need some scissors some needle and
thread which is not pictured but here's
little clip art that I found online
perfect and of course it wouldn't be my
project without me 6,000 glue so there
we go
we got all the goods bippity-boppity-boo
let's get to crafting by the way
disclaimer I don't really know what I'm
doing I've never done this before so
we're just gonna see what we come up
with on the spot great I'm always so
prepared for my videos so professional
alrighty so here you can see I put on
the dress which is actually kind of cute
but you know we're gonna go ahead and
make it fabulous by the way sorry I'm
not showing my face it's like 6:00 a.m.
and I'm not ready at all so anyway
see there's the dress so now first
things first you can see the skirt is
flared so we're gonna go ahead and make
it tight so how exactly are we gonna do
that well to be honest I don't really
know but all I did was slip it over and
kind of fold it like origami and then
stitch the pieces together over under
over under and since we're not gonna be
able to see this you can kind of totally
make a mess my favorite I said I was
gonna make this dress look good not that
I was gonna do it properly so there you
go you can see it is tight now on the
bottom umm granted it doesn't look so
great from the back that's but it
doesn't matter because you're not gonna
be able to see it so anyways next step
alright so what we're gonna do now is
deal with the glittery crystal bodice
thing oh my goodness I am so excited for
this ah yes so you can see I'm just
gonna take the applique and lay it right
on top of the dress it doesn't really
look like anything but you can see once
it's all and you can kind of tell it's
going to look amazing so we're just
gonna cut off this extra piece so it
leaves the v/line so you can see you
know just pull out the scissors it cuts
through super easy pull that away and
then you're left with the perfect dress
line then again back to the sewing over
under over under stitching it for the
beads until it is all secured in place
oh my goodness fabulous alright so next
thing we're gonna go ahead and make a
little neck piece so you can see this is
the piece that we trimmed off of the
fabric earlier basically all we're going
to do is trim off the extra here there's
actually way more professional ways to
do this but since I forgot to buy
ingredients for this we're just gonna go
ahead and use these hooks that I had
lying around my counter so you can just
slip those right through the mesh easy
peasy
and then you can hook them together so
they create like a little necklace
effect put it on perfecto you're ready
for the prom hello whoo this is dance
party worthy okay no anyways next order
of business is attaching the skirt so
we're gonna take the evil fabric and
we're just gonna stick it onto our waist
kind of like so like so look at the pun
anyways done that I've done it under the
gun I feel like a matador with this okay
anyways we're I'm distracted today so go
ahead take the fabric any fabric will do
by the way I just thought the feathers
added so much extra fun to this so we'll
go ahead wrap it around the waist and
boom that's basically all obviously you
have to attach it though so take a pin
pin it into place take it off and then
right where you pinned it go ahead and
sew the fabric right on to the dress
then alrighty are you guys ready to see
it on I know you said yes so much time
oh my god I honestly don't even know if
you guys are ready for this anyway
Jenna oh my god
this literally looks up the crystal
bodice the crystal necklace wow this is
literally such a look the black strappy
shoes the feather skirt oh wow
you can see how sparkly it came out oh
my god in the necklace oh it's fabulous
I'm living for the drama of this skirt
