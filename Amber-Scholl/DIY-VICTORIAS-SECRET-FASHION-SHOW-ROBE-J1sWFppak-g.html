to my channel so today I'm broadcasting
live from my bed in honor of the
Victoria's Secret Fashion Show that I
would bust out the little satin robes
and show you guys how to make the
bathrobes that all of the models are
always wearing because they're so
stinking cute but they're wildly
overpriced so today I thought I would
show you how to make your own because
you can do the same thing and get the
look for like 20 bucks so here we go
channeling our in our angels DIY
bathrobe style
alrighty guys you're going to need some
iron-on letters and applique I got these
to say my name they've knit them to say
anything um
bright or happy or dream or sister you
know whatever floats your fancy then I
also got these angel wings these were I
think three dollars downtown so pretty
fun this is what we're going to use to
iron onto the robe we also of course are
going to need a silky robe this is
actually by one of my friends Arica sato
she's a doll they come in a bunch of
different colors like they have the pink
one with the lace I'm gonna use my black
one just because that is what I'm in the
mood for today but they're all fabulous
and super cheap too you're also going to
want to get a piece of cardboard just
because that helps when you're ironing
things on we're also going to want to
grab a ruler um for some unknown reason
I cannot find my ruler I don't know if I
never owned one because I never used one
but anyways borrowing this from my
neighbor because they don't have a ruler
either perhaps rulers are going extinct
I don't know so this is like really
dirty and gross but whatever grab a
ruler you'll be good to go last but not
least grab yourself an iron and we can
get started obviously this isn't on you
guys otherwise I wouldn't be grabbing it
okay here we go alright the first thing
you were going to want to do is open the
robe so you can see like the front part
of it and then you're going to grab the
cardboard and go ahead and put that in
the back here this is so when you're
ironing it um it doesn't like melt
through the fabric there you go go ahead
and close that up like this oh look at
this depo young men ready for work okay
the robe is now all flipped over and the
cardboard is underneath there so it's
like hard alright so now what you're
going to do is take all of these little
appliques I ended up cutting these in
half
where's the other one here it is um so I
ended up getting these in half just so I
could be able to like move them around
and put them where I wanted so now all
you've got to do is lay the appliques
where you want them to go I'm going to
kind of want them to start a little bit
by the armholes I think so we'll put one
right there we'll put this one right
here make them even as they can be you
know obviously and then I'm going to
want to go ahead and put my name if you
happen to have the letters like I have
where you can just trim off the excess
go ahead and do that that way you can
fit them a little closer together so I
just did that with some scissors real
quick
and made a nice little mess so now that
I got the basic outline down I want to
make sure that it's even so I'm just
going to go ahead and take the wings off
because those are not going to be what
I'm learning on first I'm going to want
to iron my name on first and I want to
make sure that it's even so I'm just
going to take the little ruler you can
go ahead and line up the letters make
sure that it's like not completely a
mess whatever you get the gist make sure
they're actually properly aligned and
then we can start the iron them on also
so mind you here we go this is the
letter and now what you have to do for
the letter just to iron it on is this
backing actually comes off so you can
see like this and there we go it's kind
of like sticky adhesive but this is what
you are going to just lay onto the
fabric like this and then we will iron
it on like so so go ahead remove the
backing and place them all over the robe
where you want them to go so once you
got that all laid out go ahead and grab
your iron plug it in we're just going to
go ahead and iron this onto this so then
the little stickers will get molded into
the robe hold it for about 30 seconds
and you will be good to go here we go
you guys you can just go ahead and peel
off the plastic once they're all done
boop-boop-boop yes look at that alrighty
so there we go you can see it now has my
name on it looking fabulous so now we're
just going to go ahead and do the same
thing but with the wings
and there we go just go ahead and peel
off the crystal backing and tada you've
got your very own crystal eyes silky
bathrobe so there have you guys that is
how I made my little crystal e bathrobe
I hope you guys enjoyed the DIY as
always if you have any questions
comments concerns all my socials are at
amber shoal I love you so very much um
this is so weird to be filming upside
down like this so I think this is gonna
be the last video that I do this for but
um I don't know I just wanted to shake
it up why not life is short and you only
live once so hope you guys enjoy the
crystal e bathrobe like I said this
would work for literally any kind of
project that you want to do um for
having a bridal party or a baby shower
or a birthday or whatever you want just
bedazzle it put whatever you want on the
robe it's so fun or t-shirts or you know
literally anything this is the same
process so have a good time go enjoy
being little bedazzled e beauty's I love
you so much my little angels um and also
