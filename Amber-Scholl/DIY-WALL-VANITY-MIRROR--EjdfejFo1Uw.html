amber and today I'm going to show you
how I made my very own wall vanity
mirror I get so many questions about
this on social media this is my infamous
selfie station in case you recognize it
um for following me on Instagram but I'm
going to show you it literally it took
me less than a day and was super cheap
is the whole project costs under 50
bucks so stay tuned I'll show you how I
made it alright here we go we are at a
store called light bulbs unlimited which
is right across the street from my house
so we are going to go in here but you
can try a Lowe's or a Home Depot or even
Amazon they should have anything your
heart desires alright guys we are inside
the light bulb store and this place is
so cool look at this whoa it was just
literally wall-to-wall light bulbs I did
not know a place like this existed but
lo and behold I googled where to buy
light bulbs and this place was right
across the street from my house so I
walked here but so what we're gonna get
today is LED lights for our vanity
mirror you can ask someone in the store
they will totally know what you're
talking about even you can just go to
Lowe's or Home Depot that you need LED
lights and they will show you where to
go
so investigate the products alright so
here we go here's all the selection of
lights these actually look fabulous if I
could afford them I would get them these
are LED puck lights with a remote
control and these are just
battery-powered so you literally can
push on them and they will turn on and
off but these are fancy and come with
so those seem cool but we are going to
go with the cheaper option we're going
to get this instead wireless LED puck
lights super-bright long-lasting LED no
wires no plugs so that means you
literally push on them and they will
light up so this is what we are going to
get and bring home to make our mirror
and just for me we are also going to get
some of these these are spotlights these
are swivel and I'm going to put these at
the top of the mirror just because like
I said mine is going to be for taking
photos so having some light that is
mobile is good too you can switch the
angle around so we're gonna get maybe
two or three of these okay so this is
what we are looking for look at this
this is just battery powered all you
have to do is press it and it'll turn on
so that is where we're gonna get our
craftiness from so this is the ones
we're gonna put straight on the wall and
then for me you have these can you do a
little demo of this all right so these
are ooh an extra special spotlight we're
going to put on the top of the mirror
and like I said so for photo lighting
and or you're trying to light something
else your fancy and cool so we're gonna
bring them home and see what we can do
with them thank you
thank you all right here we go all right
so this is the mirror we're going to be
decorating today as you can see I got a
little overexcited and put a couple up
before I even started filming this but
this is a wall mirror I got from Ikea it
was 39.99 it is full-length and it is
what I use for all my infamous selfies
on Instagram but if you want to do this
on a wall mirror that is what I'm going
to show you today but also you can do a
little you know the mirrors you get from
Target that are be like this big and you
can put those on there as well but for
today's purposes we're gonna do this one
so here we go
alright so I went ahead and opened the
package this is what's inside the little
lights and they also come I ripped this
off the wall because like I said I got
too excited today without filming it but
they come with little sticky things on
the inside if you don't have that
double-sided tape will work but like I
said mine came with batteries included
and these little sticky tapes all you
have to do is peel it off and stick it
on here and then you just stick it right
on the wall so here we go and like I
said batteries are included so tada all
right let's stick it on the wall ok so
you want to pick a spot on the mirror
that you know you want it to be
illuminated so as you can see this
mirror I'm going to put lights all over
it but for now we're just going to start
with these two little sections I have my
light and literally all you do is stick
it on the wall like it is the easiest
thing in the world
boom press on it a little make sure it's
on there good here we go
make sure that's focused boom that's
literally all you do and I was like for
easy installation and then check it out
tada whew so then there you go
line it up do what is wrong with my
focus I'm sorry my cameras being weird
let me see oh my god technical
difficulties there you high okay so make
sure that you just line them all over
the mirror wherever you want you can put
them all up and down literally anywhere
I'm going to put some on the top too so
we will do those right now but yeah the
easiest installation of anything I've
ever experienced DIY man the x PS in
case you're wondering literally to hang
this mirror all I did was
knock two screws into the wall and hang
it up it took 30 seconds
um no mails needed you can literally do
it yourself ladies so there you have
that just in case you were wondering how
I hung it up alright so here we go this
is the fancy spotlight that we got going
on as I drop it okay so she's a fancy
spotlight that I bought this one doesn't
have batteries included so this one
needed three triple A's pro tip if you
need batteries literally go to the
dollar store there $0.99 and they work
just as well as the store brand ones so
we're just gonna open this up maybe it's
really hard to film and open things but
we're gonna try anyway mmm okay now
we're gonna pause filming while I put
the batteries in this but I will resume
in one second alright there we go not
that hard put those in close it back up
and you are ready to go it literally
comes with a little sticky thing so you
just peel it off it's like double sided
tape loop alright and you'll stick it on
here just kind of line it up with a
circle fabulous alright but after you
stick it on there all you got to do is
peel the other piece off mmm
tada so now you have the double sided
tape sticking and it is ready to be
stuck onto the wall so here we go
alright so since I already put all of
these on the side here I'm gonna want to
put this one since it's like a specialty
spotlight one right in the center
because I want the light to come right
down on to me so let's see if we can
align this properly eyeball it because
life just isn't that serious I'm here we
go
put it like right up there
like an eyeball just push it on here
that was easy
how's that for easy installation okay
there we go
woo nice now what's cool about this guy
all you have to do is press the button
to turn it on and you can swivel it all
over the place so that's really nice I
want it to sorry I'm blinding you looks
kind of like a minute okay I mean if you
I want it to be shining right on to me
to create a nice little oh you can see
the lights and the shadows already um so
it'll create kind of more
like coming right down on to me just not
from the sides alright so here we go
let's turn them all on ten ton ton ton
push push oh my gosh this is so fun I
feel like Buddy the elf in the elevator
mmm
okay and there we go we are fully
illuminated folks and as you can see I
now and perfectly lit up great for
selfies if that's what you're into or
it's just a great mirror to get ready in
and there we go you can see your full
outfit and it looks kind of cool maybe
if you wanted something more
aesthetically pleasing I would put these
lights all over surrounding the whole
thing but since we're doing a
budget-friendly version these lights
literally cost $10 per pack of three and
this light was a little more expensive
this was $20 so all in all what is that
10 20 40 so it's like 40 bucks for all
the lights and then this mirror was also
40 bucks and this is a huge mirror my do
from Ikea you can get these at Target
for like 10 umm but yeah there we go
we've got our vanity mirror and it looks
really cool especially if you come up
close say cheese
alright guys there you have it that's
how I made my very own vanity mirror

enjoy your vanity like I said this
actually also would totally work on a
little desk fan
my roommates being loud but this would
also work on a little a desk vanity
mirror if that's what you want to do
just put the mirror or put the lights

stick them right on and it'll look great
sitting on your desk so hope you enjoy
