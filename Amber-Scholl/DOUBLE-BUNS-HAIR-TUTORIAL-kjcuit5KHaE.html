to my channel um so today I'm going to
be doing a quick little tutorial because
I was super inspired by Khloe
Kardashian's latest Instagram picture to
do this little Spice Girls spacejam
Lizzie McGuire circa 2002 bundu I'm not
even sure what the heck this is but I
thought it was super cute um and it's
really really easy so I'm gonna show you
today how to do it in five minutes or
less alright now the best thing about
the pair style is like I said it
literally is so easy you guys it
requires basically no talent at all
because I started doing hair and let me
tell you if I could do it you can
definitely do it so all you have to do
is start out with them brushing your
hair as you know I wear extensions based
on my other videos but this style is
actually way easier to do with short
hair so we're going to leave those out
of this particular hairstyle um and my
do my hair is about three days unwashed
so that's the other benefit of this
hairstyle it doesn't have to be clean at
all so brush it out but it alright step
number two find the middle part as you
can see mine's pretty much already in a
middle part the more symmetrical it is
the better I'm using a little teaser
comb to do this because it's a little
easier to find but there we go
middle part done alright so now that you
got your part all you got to do is split
your hair into the two halves budding
but in half on the left half on the
right doesn't have to be perfect this is
not rocket science people you can do it
all right now if you want the little
Messier aesthetic like Chloe has in her
picture make sure you take a little bit
of the fuzzies out of the front so just
like that again doesn't have to be
perfect however much or little you want
depending on the level of messiness
aesthetic you're going for I'm just
going to leave those out if you have
bangs that's a good place to put them
and there we go cut off all right so now
comes the fun part
literally just pull up half your hair
you're going to do both sides so don't
stress about which one and pull it up
into kind of a half little ponytail
thing cut off comb it a few times boom
take a hair tie
and secure it in place just like you
would a regular ponytail or bun all
right now granted you want this to be
pretty high on top of your head which is
a little more abnormal so make sure it's
up there near the part like up off to
the side a little bit and there we go
now once you've got it secured make sure
you do one more extra loop and this is
the this is the special one so instead
of pulling it all the way through like
you did the other ones just pull it
about half way so you've got a little
space bun action going on and leave the
extra out because we will deal with that
right now all right now what you want to
do with this extra little piece is take
it and wrap it around the bottom part of
the bun like this Boop cuz that'll just
make it look a little more in place then
take some bobby pins you know just like
the ones that you're when your mom used
to do your hair as a kids with like stab
you it hurt really badly but just take a
regular old bobby pin and pin the hair
in place Boop you can use as many or as
few as you want depends what kind of
aesthetic you're going for I personally
like it to look a little messy so I will
just mess it up a little bit more there
we go you can just kind of pull on the
little bun thing pin that tada
alright so we'll do the other side of
this too just to make it even but um pin
that down
fabulous all right there we go one half
of a big fun done now we'll do the other
side
anyone is a car if you want my future if
you want a cup with me then
don't go buddy stand
get your act
you'll be just fine
all right there we go just kind of get
them as symmetrical as you can obviously
you're not gonna get them perfect the
first time or probably the second time
or the third time it's really hard to
get them like exactly perfect but all
you want to do is get as close as you
can
it really just doesn't matter like isn't
that serious guys okay last thing just
to clean it up a bit I am obsessed with
these little clips you can get them from
CBS for like 99 cents I respect a pinup
to baby hair in the back can you even
understand me I like to pin up the baby
hairs in the back there we go I program
those oops and clip them on up just
securing them like you would obviously
clip your hair all right there you go
now you can kind of pull out a few more
hairs or a few less hair depending on
how messy you want it um and then also I
personally while I do like a messy
aesthetic I also like to go totally put
together so it's like the hot mess
you know um so I like to take care of
spray this is John Frieda hair spray
it's like from the drugstore now if
there's a little prick I don't know if
this is a real thing but I believe that
Miss I will spray the hairspray directly
onto my hand and then rub it so that way
I can put it wherever I want instead of
spraying the whole thing and getting
like your whole hair disgusting you know
you can kind of spot spot treat minutes
alright and there you have it you guys
