check it out diamonds are rated on the
4th east color cut 2 carats and clarity

each color okay age 8 and the one that
you looked at was a brown color okay six
carat stone okay so this was the higher
quality color and each color this is

alright guys so we have arrived downtown
we are going to investigate the downtown
a real diamond department this is called
jewelry or no this is called the diamond
district so we'll see a we can find
anything for cheaper it's my favorite
we're gonna try this place the jewelry
Plaza because it looks very fun in here
so let's see what we've got
look at this place this is so cool at
ease
look at this one no I'm like
look at this you like the imperfection
right you can see the little diamond wow
look at it just sitting there you guys
oh my god
look we gave it a house this is shiny
look at all the crystals in their
natural habitat alrighty so since uh we
followed a lot of fabulous diamonds but
we didn't actually buy anything today
we're just looking for you know ideas so
now we're gonna go to my favorite place
and to get to my favorite thing ever
my people this is the kind of content I
live for it even more extra than me this
is so fun look at that ice mamacita whoa
oh that's a lot but well it's just as
beautiful like that other one which I
can see like this first right oh my gosh
I should for comparison you guys here we
go this is the fake one and the right
here and on the left I put the real one
I don't know oh my gosh these are almost
prettier than the ones we saw whoo who
needs real diamonds when you've got
some ride room I am so sorry that vlog
literally ended so weirdly abruptly um
honestly we just got so distracted
shopping for the diamonds we just like I
legit stopped filming I don't know
really but anyways we actually ended up
staying there for like almost nine hours
shopping so it was a very very long day
that was just a really brief quick
snippet that you saw but um
Mariah probably tried on a hundred
different rings it was so so fun so we
got a lot of cool ideas to send to
Spencer for info that's for damn sure
sidenote did I even show you guys a
picture of Moran Spencer look at
literally couple gulls also since I
obviously didn't buy anything since I'm
not getting engaged anytime soon much
less do I have 200 grand to drop on a
ring um so I thought I would show you
the fake rings that I bought because you
know wouldn't be my video without
something fake beautiful so I got three
beautiful little fake bands because as
far as I can get third you can't tell
the difference and I saved a like almost
three million dollars so hey it's a
bargain as always thank you guys so much
for watching I hope you have a wonderful
day full of sparkles diamonds love and
happiness also ice cream whatever it
makes you happy I hope you have a day
full of that and on that note I love you
guys kisses till next time XO
oh my goodness for me
O'Hare you shouldn't have it would be a
lot funnier if he looked more amused
about this engagement
cheer up Harry we're gonna have a great
life together</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
