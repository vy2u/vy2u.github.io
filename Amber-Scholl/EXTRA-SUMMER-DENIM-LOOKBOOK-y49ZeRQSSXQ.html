welcome back to my channel and in case
you can't tell by the denim Bodi and the
mirror the booty the booty on my neck
what but then I'm chunker on my neck and
the denim on my hands and wrists and
it's a nice ice on my fingers but that
has nothing to do with anything we are
going to go ahead and do a fully denims
out lookbook today mostly because I just
frickin love denim it's been all over
the celebrity fashion theme and it's
summer and what better time to dress
like a trendy cowgirl so without further
ado here we go how to style how to slay
how to denim denim look look already
guys we're going to kick off this
lookbook strong with my favorite look at
all denim on denim on denim I actually
wear this in my outfit of the day in my
most recent shopping video of shopping
for menswear clothing so basically this
is just a jean crop thing that I tied up
to be a little extra cute and fluffy
then we got some matching Jean booty
shorts to pull together the look but not
too super cute - it says it was all a
dream
carrot a ponytail just for some fun a
little bit of bling never hurt anybody
and then much the aesthetic with some
nude heels to go ahead and make your
legs look extra long and fabulous so
there we go side note I always read all
the comments that are like who let her
out of the house like that guys I'm 23
and live on my own
I let myself out of the house like this
I look great if they're literally
anything cuter than wearing your mom's
vintage denim look from the 80s no so
this is a totally throwback look but
also kind of a modern twist on it I
guess you could say literally this
jacket was my mom when she was in
college how cool is this this is
literally vintage guess which is the
coolest thing in the world like look at
how cute my mom and dad are on the way
to their honeymoon
my mom is rocking the denim jacket and
rocking a really wild hairdo I love it
look at hot mama this denim is
technically called like acid wash so
we've got the matching skirt that looks
super cute with it then literally this
was like six dollars at forever 21 it's
just like a little lacy crop top
actually got it in my men
video long story I just can't focus when
I'm shopping clearly um and of course
ba-boom went ahead and paired to be
attire with some red sock booties
because honestly I just thought these
were too fun not to buy it and I've been
waiting for something to wear them with
and I just think this the kind of like
varsity cheerleader girl look cheering
on my face boyfriend in the stands is
the perfect excuse to wear them oh he
would play football my imaginary
boyfriend by the way go team go go boys
go yay Majan airy football boyfriend
Oh baby Scott Disick whoo so we are
stealing this next look
strikes from the most current Queen
herself Miss Kourtney Kardashian who
literally dropped her foot boy and is
now like traveling the world in designer
bikinis with a hot young dude glowing
and living her best life so totally a
role model regardless here's this look
all right so whoever said cheese can't
be fabulous is lying to you this shirt
was literally two dollars at hmm it's
just a generic little white tank paired
it with some super cute booty shorts
definitely a little bit more on the
revealing side but you know hey why not
you work for it flaunt it girlfriend I
went ahead and pin it with some heels
because I mean it's me why not be extra
you can totally rock it with some chucks
too just as cute if you want to be a
little more cozy this outfit is just
super basic and fun you can wear it
literally any day fabulous for summer
fabulous for the beach fabulous for
picking up Penelope at her dance lessons
and fabulous for flaunting on the ground
to make Scott wish he treated you
it's a Jean it's a boot it's juice I
actually don't know what to call these
genom jeans jegging Jutes no no come up
with something in the comments below and
tell me what they're called but anyways
so it wouldn't be a denim lookbook if we
didn't have some sigh hi denim booties
these boots were all over the grand this
year and I just thought they were a
total fun and instagramming not to
include so here we go so like I said I
don't really know what we would call
these but either way they are fabulous
so we've got some super
cool then I choose thigh-high they are
literally made of Jain material like you
can see how fun is that I went ahead and
pair it with an oversized tee with a
little denim like flower thing in the
center just because I don't know like
wow that's too perfect for this look
book of course this is kind of short so
I've got those little booty shorts I
wear under all of my stuff from forever
21 to 3 bucks
and of course topsail coffe with a white
hat because no no I like hats so they're
real that is my take on the denims and
stuff so fun instead stuff oh baby
hello alright so this look is uh a lot
but basically this is a way to do with
darker denim colored denim totally
counts as denim so I thought I would
include it in the book
denim does not just mean blue denim guys
there is so many different kinds there's
also black denim white denim all sorts
of different fancy colors for you so I'm
going to go ahead and show you how
styled done so again here we got my
favorite thing in the world plain basic
black crop top from forever 21 messaging
choker I think both combines like $4.99
then whoa you might recognize these I
actually put these in my how to slay
life on a budget video there from boohoo
calm and they were a steal at sixteen
dollars and are literally quite possibly
the coolest pants ever invented so look
at that oh my god so fun and so
Instagram you look at this picture I
took of them amazing and I'd be lying if
I said this look was not based around
these shoes that I just got holy Wow and
mr. t my lucky number and everything I
actually got these on sale at Neiman
Marcus for like 75% off they are the
real fancy poem uh shoes and I love them
so there we go
how I would casually leave the house if
I were Rihanna or I guess fiber me
because I don't know
I'm extras hell oh yes next up we've got
diamonds in denim or as I would say a
look the sparkly denim princess queen
look alright so here we go so this look
we are totally taking a cue from miss
Kylie and Kim doing the denim on
sparkles people always say denim is
casual and that is exactly the reason
why you
bling it up for a new fad look so so for
this look we've got a plain little white
dress with a kind of like a flat neck
super cute I think I got this at Lulu's
but they also have it at forever 21 for
like $11 then I paired it with right DIY
denim jacket
I made this if you haven't seen that
video I'll link it but yeah look at this
glittery amazing jacket oh yes
like look at that sparkly bling
fantastic over my jacket paired with the
necklace paired with the dress prepared
with those shoes that everyone always
laughs at Kim had them and so I had to
get them they are so weird they are
literally like see-through booties but I
don't know I figured except it's good
enough for Kim it's good enough for me
but I think one of them oh baby all
denim looks away in the game holy this
is the cutest outfit ever oh my god so
this look we are rocking again a
different form of denim Oh white denim
we've got a denim cropped jacket with
some rips I got this downtown LA for
like 30 bucks they have it online too
though so I'll link it below this I know
a little revealing even for me but this
literally is a rift of denim bro wet
which I thought was too cute not to buy
paired it with some high-waisted killer
white ripped jeans and of course but boo
licensed patent leather amazing my
fabulous bag doesn't hurt the whole look
and a fake Gucci looking hair typing
with some cool funnies such an aesthetic
you look like you're ready to go to like
I don't know the Italian Riviera on a
segway except stopping at a fashion show
on the way there to get gelato I don't
even know what I'm talking about okay
anyways that's this look time for the
next one
we're well oh I'm here for the business
meeting
you know the denim business meeting
where we're planning corporate denim
things no no no anyways here we go
alright so I can't even believe I'm
going to try and pass this off as
business but I'm going to try anyway
here we go
business denim so this is my business
hose and I'm look basically we've got a
really cool white like biker jacket
biker jackets and denim look amazing
together I'm not really sure why but I
guess the style just kind of mesh well
a denim choker because it wouldn't be a
denim look book cuz I didn't include at
least one denim Joker in it match the
choker to some denim jeans
I still got these jeans downtown they
were like literally $13 and look at this
biome so pink and cute that's white
business lady you'll if you really want
to like pretend their business be you
can to be honest I was actually going to
wear this with a different pair of shoes
check it out like look at that how fun
beautiful literally match the geez
exactly but even I was like okay maybe
that's a little much on the venom front
but to be honest I mean I still think it
looks groovy but you know trying to be
more everyday wearable for you guys wink
wink
I could wait that wink real there we go
my best attempt okay there yet
next look hello yes forever 21 denim
denim denim and you should totally
collab with amber Scholl yes that's all
fine alright so I couldn't do a full
lookbook and not include any dark denim
so here we have some denim and fall over
here but anyways so this look is super
cute um and this is actually a dupe
scarf Soto so I've got that thrown on
with the same little white dress that I
was wearing earlier but this one is in
black super cute this is an oversized
man a denim jacket super dark wash and
it matches perfectly with my denim heels
without the same dark wash so fun little
rip ankle booties that are just no
bomb.com so there we go super sexy biker
chic kind of looks like a tie kind of
looks
I really don't even know you guys can
name this outfit in the comments I
really don't know what's called it but I
look group
so whatever and last but not least we've
got my dumb look that shook the Internet
to Pearlie genes so just in case you
missed the video where I made these
these are actually DIY pearly genes
inspired by this gigi hadid
um so the tutorial is up on my channel
if you want to see how I did that but
paired of these babies with some nice
little plain nude shoes just because the
pants are so over-the-top extra and you
know something's extra if I say it's
extra to pull in the lace from the
bottom I've got this little corset thing
which is actually a bra from Victoria's
Secret but I wear to the top because why
the hell not turn it with a matching
little lace headband and tada that is
the grand finale so there you have it
you guys that is my take on a very denim
lookbook I hope you guys enjoyed the
video because like I said denim does not
have to be boring you guys just like
anything else in life fashion should be
fun denim should be fun and forget no
stigma of boring we'll just throw on
jeans and a t-shirt no just like
anything else in life denim should be
fun fashion should be fun and uh
honestly overall life should be fun so
make sure you're going out and living
your dreams kids on that note getting a
little inspirational and sappy for a
gentle most folks but hey anyways on
that note I love you guys so very much
don't forget to subscribe to the channel
if you haven't already so that's more
fun denim love books now I'm kidding
I'll do like not denim love books this
is the only denim look book I've ever
done so I mean if you want more I'll do
more you know what I'm rambling I love
you guys I'll see you guys super soon
enjoy your summer Jenna me looks and
kisses until next time my precious
beautiful denim clad angels exile
