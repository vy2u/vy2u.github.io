Oh Christian Oh Christian oh no
Christian unfortunately that's about a
sexy that's gonna get here folks
but anyways it's up you guys it's amber
welcome back to my channel and today I
thought in the spirit of Valentine's Day
it would go ahead and crank up the sexy
and do a fifty Shades of Grey lookbook
but since I'm pretty sure that's not
actually allowed on the internet I
thought it was the perfect opportunity
to go ahead and spoof it and do fifty
Shades of Grey get it like fifty Shades
of Grey literally I love a good bud
sorry that further ado here we go Fifty
Shades of Grey the lookbook
I can't wink but whatever look so the
first shade of grey we have in our
lookbook is this fabulous little grey
skirt which is so funny because I think
this was actually the first outfit in my
last lookbook but it's just so cute
keeps coming in handy so little
schoolgirl skirt got it on Amazon very
profession also kind of fun the shirt is
a tad bit Christopher Columbus looking
but it's so fun you can see it just has
like a little neck bowtie thing very
kind of Chanel inspired as for shoes we
got some killer pumps oh yes side note
on this bruise it's not from any wild
Christian gray asked activities it's
literally I walked into a drawer because
I'm clumsy as hell so anyways there's
that story it's like look at that so
gnarly but still cute look regardless
there we go ready to show up at the
office in style if I was married to
Christian Grey and he was in the Mafia
okay no just kidding so look for this
look we've got our shades on I got these
for like five bucks at H&amp;amp;M is so cute
but shades aside we've got an adorable
little gray kind of jumper looking thing
pinstripes are all the rage right now
but this is actually not even a jump
right this is actually a top and
separate shorts bottom so these come out
apart together but I'm gonna leave them
together for now this leaves are all tie
up so cute of course paired it with some
saucy leggings and of course some killer
black boots
oh yes work mama ready to take down the
bad guys in style mmmmmm revenge is a
dish best served cold oh my goodness you
can't even see me invisible okay so here
is our next look we're good to the gym
chemists oh okay oh if asked where I get
my gym clothes from honestly I get
almost 99% of them from forever21
because they're cheap and then fit super
cute so this is a little set that I just
got I think the top and bottoms together
total was like $30 so cute yeah I got
the camo booty puppet ready to go on a
jog and meet our mister grave on the I
was gonna say the pull-up machine that
doesn't even make any sense
what's this hate lifting area one
shopping - shopping three shopping for
for speaker I got some old sparkly kicks
are so cute I found a similar care
online linked below we're ready for
anything
mm-hmm-hmm casual mrs. gray started off
with some bootylicious great denim and
some grey shades because you know why
not great denim is totally underrated
and such a fun way to dress up a regular
outfit of denim I definitely almost just
fell over there but pretend you guys
didn't see that so we got some nice high
waist gray denim then paired with a
white turtleneck bodysuit ahh sliced up
with some amazing white shoes you can
get Dux of the Giuseppe Zanotti on
Amazon for like $30 and there you go
killer shade of gray look boo almost
fell over again okay next look all right
Ian now to the good stuff kidding we
don't got a great swimsuit here for you
which is so exciting because for girls
who have larger chest like me you know
it's so so hard to find something that
fits so I was so stoked when I found
this yesterday especially in gray
perfect timing for the lookbook so this
is just a great bikini top I got at H&amp;amp;M
a super cute I'm pretty sure it's
available online this is a size 12 just
for reference
then we got some super fun little
high-waisted bottoms ignore my
ridiculous tan lines but I also got
these at H&amp;amp;M you can see the kind of
full coverage in the back they're super
cute I'm wearing slippers with this
because I literally did not know what
else to put on my feet but there we go
ready to hit the beach great
okay next switching gears now from sexy
to conservative yes this is a
conservative look we have long sleeves
on don't question it so this when we
switched hairstyles I went ahead and put
it in a little like poofy weird thingy
then we've got this adorable gray
oversized sweater dress hook this up
from H&amp;amp;M this morning touched it with a
little head thing that makes it look
like are going to a spot and really
whipped the whole thing together with
since I hi black boots ooh mom I yes got
the peep toe got the suede it's so cute
so cute mm-hmm
perfectly fabulous and just short enough
that Christian gray would not produce
all right you went ahead it through our
hair down for this next look this one is
a very Kardashian inspired gray all the
Kate ladies wear sporting looks like
these last year's super cute you can see
gray top with the matching grace skirt
very cache actually got both of these at
forever 21 the shirt was nine bucks and
the skirt was 12 so definitely a nice
bargain then for shoes I went ahead and
just put on some totally basic black
strappy heels because we're going for
kind of a more basic understated look
even though understated is like my least
favorite word but understated outfit
overstated pose there we have it folks
grace this is extremely uncomfortable
and I'm probably gonna fall over again
so all righty this one's not 50 shades
of grey but it definitely is two shades
of grey 50 shades of grey two shades of
grey it's all the same who's counting so
here we have a super cute little gray
dress I got this from forever 21 for
nine bucks so such a steal paired it
with a really cool dark you can't really
tell but this is actually a dark
charcoal gray jacket snagged it from the
men's section Sun tip so lucky I just so
happened to find literally exactly Matt
Richt Deneb booties I just thought these
were so fun and parallel together it
gives it like a funky little
monochromatic but not monochromatic look
50 shades of Jay okay I tried to do that
like genom jeggings thing but that
didn't work at all
next on a stage of steal why are you
dressed like sheriff from clueless
because Christian I'm a woman I do what
I want you can't control me so here we
have our next look which definitely it's
kind of a little bit old 90s inspired
we've got a little plaid dress so
stinking cute pair do it again with some
very vintage Oxford's and some little
nineties socks oh that's horrible that's
my talent show of the day thanks for
watching maybe even throw in a blazer or
something to be like a little more
professional but there we go a very
retro shade of grey mm-hmm yes welcome
to the grey express Judy Chu Joe a
conductor amber grey at your service all
right so here we have the next look do I
definitely look like a train conductor
yes but do I look cute yes
here I've got a tweet little overall
skirt thing so thinking cute then we
went ahead and put am the black
turtleneck bodysuit underneath it I can
never resist the chance to be matched so
we went ahead and pulled out the tweed
hat that matches it just so perfectly
again with the fire black tights and
those black boots again because they are
just too cute so there we go all aboard
the grey Express hmm my lady who changed
back into the first look here because
this one was the most Anastasia mask

own mr. grey I hope you have a wonderful
