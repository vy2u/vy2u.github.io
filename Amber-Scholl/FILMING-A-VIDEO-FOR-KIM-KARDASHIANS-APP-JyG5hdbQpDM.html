watching k'kaw beauty TV um I don't know
what shape I just made but you know what
is up you guys
it's amber and um can you tell where I
am
I can't kW beauties
I am literally screaming there's
actually a room full of people here
watching me scream so I'm gonna refrain
from screaming too much but today I am
so excited because I am filming a video
for Kim Kardashian's app so if you want
to see me do my everyday makeup routine
which obviously I'm wearing right now uh
stay tuned because we're gonna rewind
this right now by the way disclaimer I
am NOT a beauty guru you guys know this
so thanks for tuning into my videos
anyway I'm trying to judge me too hard
but uh this is gonna be good camera is
rolling
wait yeah hey guys alright so um we are
barefaced this is actually so
embarrassing I like never go on camera
with nothing on because why would I do
that so first thing I'm gonna prime my
face we're gonna use this I get this
from CBS it's still 50 dollars though
which is like such a ripoff just gonna
put that all over my face like this I do
oh yes okay so now we're gonna use my
Beauty Blender just like every beauty
guru we have got a nice cup of water
okay I really should have had James
Charles show me how to do this right
came in but here we go
for foundation I use tada the Make Up
For Ever HD stick just put that all over
my face in no order at all just you know
everywhere I've had a hell of a morning
by the way oh can I say that yeah okay
I've had a hell of a morning by the way
I on my way here you can't see it but my
skirt is literally ripped so thank God
I'm not showing that I didn't
also on the way here my nail broke so
kept us up at a salon on the way here to
get it fixed
oh and I left my phone at home by the
way which I had to go back and get so
yeah morning going just about as well as
this foundation operation put it on my
nose too because I forgot to do it so
now we're gonna do the contour and
highlight and we're gonna use k'kaw
Beauty because that's where I am and
also I actually use this stuff every day
so we're going to do our concealer now
which we have concealed number seven
there we go just gonna put this on um I
don't really know the T of where you're
supposed to actually put this I've
watched like a hundred million tutorials
and I still don't really know if I'm
supposed to do but I just put it on
under my eyes like this and kind of on
the sides of my nose so you create like
a weird face paint pattern yes and just
Pat that back in there we go you can see
kind of like brightens up my face mm-hmm
then we're gonna use the contour stick
number two what I do for this is
literally just kind of scribble it all
over my face okay I'm like a grand you
can see it actually kind of looks like a
cran so suck it in your face mmm just
kind of put some lines here so this is
not correct but you know it ends up
looking good so just go with it here's
the magic are you ready prepare to be
amazed
oh yes blendy blendy contour our nose -
yes fabulous darling we're gonna finish
blending this in a minute but for now
we're gonna also put this on our eyes
because that's what I use instead of
eyeshadow this looks so much you just go
with the boat but I've learned that into
my eyes are closed so I can't really see
what
haha there we go I'm not sure sort of
okay so now I'm gonna go ahead and put
powder all over my face to kind of push
it into my skin so for that I'm gonna go
ahead and use this Laura Mercier powder
it's number thirteen not because that's
the tone of my skin but because 13 is my
lucky number and I figured it was close
enough so I literally just put it all
over my face make sure you blend it into
your neck too cuz otherwise you crazy
like I often forget to my fingers into
my neck and you guys always comment in
the videos so don't be me I'm doing my
best
Sarah excellent okay so um what do I do
next
I don't remember I do this every day I
still don't know what I'm doing okay we
can use the powder contour and highlight
kit Oh fabulous put that a little bit
here to set it now I'm going to go ahead
and use some setting powder so again
we've got Laura Mercier translucent
powder mm-hmm and I'm just gonna put
this all over my face balls just start
strict no not okay uh yeah no comes my
favorite part
no no no no highlighter voila
you can see I actually already kind of
have highlight over them because I was
watching these off-camera earlier but
get watching new highlighters ooh and
you all know that highlighter is my
favorite part of makeup so I'm so pumped
so we have let's see we have palette one
hmm - so here's the - I really like this
one this one was my favorite one when I
was watching so we are going to just put
that basically all over my face so we're
gonna put this on the inner corner of my
eyes whoo
oh you guys are you seeing that oh so
shiny ah hmm okay so now we're gonna put
it on our nose also you see you that how
cute like a bunny and of course we're
gonna put it on our cheeks whoo oh are
you seeing that okay so um we're gonna
chill Prosecco the highlighter and we're
going to finish up our eyes with my
eyebrows because lordy Lordy they need
some assistance we're going to whip out
the Anastacio a Beverly Hills eyebrow
container so got my little brow brush
and we're just gonna dip that in here so
there we go one row no brow tada
so now we're gonna set them in with gel
this is benefit gimme brow gel it
actually I don't know if this was a free
sample I don't know why it's so small
but I'm just gonna use that to set my
brows into place look good eyebrows
lookin good
so to make your eyes look bigger I'm
gonna line the inner corner of them
what's a nude liner so I'm just gonna
put that on the inner water line I
remember watching my mom do this when I
was younger and I would like cringe so
hard because I thought it was really
painful but it's actually not it doesn't
hurt at all
who knew you can't even feel part of
your eye which I guess it's weird I
don't usually wear eyeshadow on the
ragas so I'm gonna go back and use the
same powder contour that I was using all
over my face and I'm gonna put it under
my eye to create like a eyeshadow a
shadow effect
they're also cheaper cuz you don't have
to buy us do so now we're gonna do
mascara this is two-faced better than
Exce mascara because I just really
wanted to say that on camera so I'm just
gonna put that on like you know anyone
on the top and then we're gonna take a
pause for a second don't know lashes are
my signature thing about you felt
completely bald throughout this entire
video without wearing them so now we're
gonna put on match this we're gonna bust
out my fancy one since we are doing
something fancy today we're being a real
good bro so we're gonna put these on all
I'm gonna use is some black lash glue
and my got my tweezers which you can see
armpit does well how fun are these whoa
who is she one half of my face okay I'm
only a perfection it's about very few
things in life one of them my lashes and
that's about it
look at that love it wow I look like a
totally different person with lashes on
I really feel like not myself in Oh
without them so okay now I'm gonna do
mascara on the bottom again because well
we actually didn't do it yet so so not
again for the first time it really makes
your eyes feel humongous I don't know if
you can see it but up close this eye
looks 700 times bigger than the side so
are either Donna eyebrows are done and
uh we're almost done here you guys are
always asking what lip color I'm wearing
in my videos this all of them every
single video unless I'm wearing red I'm
wearing this so all I do is literally
scribble this all over my lips
I also like to over line them because
why not
half big half small nice there you go um
yeah I'm gonna do the other half of my
lip so I don't look like a crazy thought
this would be interesting what if I
showed up on a date like this was like
hi
maybe this is why I don't date okay now
it's since again we're doing Marva
fanciful everyday makeup tutorial oh I'm
not gonna lie I bought this purely
because I thought it was cute
whoa tomforde lipstick look at that good
for Instagram so I'll just put that in
the center you really can't even see it
but I feel stupid that I bought this and
never use it so throw it together
oh and now it's the perfect shade of
nude hmm and it's last but not least do
you see that I want to learn how to
juggle now because I saw the video of
Harry Styles knowing how to juggle so I
wanted to learn how to juggle too
because that's just the kind of wife I
would be oh oh no I'm just gonna go
ahead and spray this all over my face to
set it into place ready close your eyes
because feels like you're drowning
actually it doesn't feel like anything
but you should still close your eyes
that's why some people I need to do so
alrighty am I done is that my am I
forgetting something I want you to by
the way I know I am a youtuber which is
like so funny at that you guys are
