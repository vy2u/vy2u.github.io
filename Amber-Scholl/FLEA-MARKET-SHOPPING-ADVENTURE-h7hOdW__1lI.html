back to my channel and today I'm rocking
some sunny today because oh lordy it is
literally like 102 degrees in LA and it
is so hot huh I know we're inside but
like I said before I have no air
conditioning so I'm just like Oh melting
oh there's not really an excuse for me
wearing the sunglasses I just I don't
know I wanted to get ready so they
looked trending anything so today I just
thought it'd be fun to take you guys on
my weekly journey to LA version of a
flea market called Melrose trading
posters like this cute little trendy um
kinda vintage market thing it's so fun
so I figured you know what why not take
you guys with me so um well I guess
instead of just talking about it let's
go plus I'm already ready with my shades
and such so without further ado here we
go shopping at the flea market
alright as always here is our outfit of
the day you can see my vanity mirror
like really needs to help all the
batteries are dying so I need to ask you
know replace those but you can see I was
involved in the intro I just had my
usual little messy bun and of course my
sunnies that for some reason I'm
refusing to take off some very cool
jewels ooh la la an extra special green
one because my birthday is in August I'm
a Leo my birthday's on the 13th so like
tomorrow
24 likes I'm old anyway back to the look
we've got some white shorts that I don't
really think are meant to be worn
outside by themselves but I don't care
whenever look and cute smashed it with
some cool Yeezy dupes and voila ready to
flea market it up in style a magnificent
palm tree filled la take people
executive usually I stop to say hi to
dogs but today there's a turtle hi
turtle good luck on your journeys turtle
I'm just kidding he has an owner don't
worry but what a cutie alright back to
shopping by the way I forgot today is
Sunday so the farmers market is still
going on because it's only like 12:30
right now so then we're going to pop in
there really quick on our way
Oh side note this is the balm on pop-up
store
like actually right next to my house
could you just die Wow incredible but
for now we will go to the print market
like I said so tada
here we are this is a really awkward
place to vlog which I usually don't care
about but I don't know I come here so
often I don't want people to think I'm
crazy but here we go
alrighty so here we go you guys this is
a the Melrose farmers market it's like
so singing cute they come here all the
time I love it well as all sorts of
beautiful flowers like look at how
beautiful all the fruits are and they
give you for example my favorite thing
free look at how beautiful it all is wow
this is like tomato aesthetic heaven
like I said I could really spend all day
here but I really don't need any of this
so we're going to hash it off smooth
alrighty so this is the Melrose trading
post you can see it just literally looks
like a giant or a farmers market
I know gianter is not a word but
whatever you can get the gist of it so
uh let's see what kind of trouble we can
stir up here like look at all the rings
and jewelry oh my god it just goes on
and on forever mission and my Kim yet
West look at these I don't even know
what these are but this man assures me
that their chairs so I'm going to sit in
it oh wow this is great
my goodness look at how beautiful these
are they're amazing
oh my god shoot like I'm in a different
world when I hear some gloves heaven
look at them all
six-year-old me is living my best life
principal baby clothes oh my god the
 you oh wow my future
child can read so well no one not
anytime soon though solid like so fun I
don't even know what half of it is but I
like love it's it's shopping at all
these cool things because they find the
most unique hey yo look at this is like
Jean Lynn blue eye we can find some fun
stuff in here alright so I really wanted
to get some of those beans that like
Kylie Jenner had with the rest of us so
I'm gonna see if they have any in here
to cook with you guys all the genes and
these are the winners you'll see later
get some really cool unique furniture to
like oh my God look at this couch and
again I don't know what these are but
they're sparkly whoo this room looks
like very tumblr look at that
alright so we're just going to keep on
wandering West you next team
this is the greatest thing I've ever
seen
oh yeah look at this room ah so
beautiful I love how they have all the
different cultures here la is just so
diverse it is so cool oh my goodness
this is like sparkly heaven whoo the way
view is random interruption look who I
ran into
oh my god no I came to be in your vlog I
was wearing this shirt in the last video
for you a fashion no bill you look cool
so it's a cool outfit look at that is
goal free today
this is Bradley too so we ought to hold
the whole Darwin here but that's all
thanks for being my video camera and I
told you everyone's here everywhere you
are using sewing my goatee that's so
random literally everyone is here so
annually um to the shopping mall my
favorite little krisily chakra things I
hear these regulat energies and I'm
super infamous oh well look at this one
it's huge
for reference this is my hand Wow
speaking of apostolis not sure what this
is but I could probably use one look at
that outfit still playing
I know one of you guys tweeted me the
absolute money other day I was dying
look at this picture and that's not me
maybe not for like what a minute so
thank you
whoa I don't know what this is but just
this cool it's like fourth century BC
nah I'm kidding I don't think that's
right more like the 1800s but whatever I
like love the fashion drawings these are
amazing oh my god this was such a mood
me as an 80 year old filming cursor it
would be an aesthetic if it wasn't so
sunny and sweaty
oh look at all the shoe not quite as
cool in mine but still groovy I could
honestly walk around here forever and
love these little inspirational things
but I thought this one was cool
that's words of advice all right so like
I said it's so hot I'm like sweating to
death so up time to take you home and
show you what I caught
all righty are you guys ready for my
haul it totally looks like I'm making my
god but anyways it all fit in one tiny
bag all right so what did we get
oh yes I got these jeans oh so cool you
can see there's a rip to Levis with the
holes in the rear end just like that
pair Kylie Jenner was wearing so I was
pretty pumped about these I'll try those
on in a second for you
all righty so here we go you can see the
jeans I'm definitely kind of like a
loser boyfriend kind of fit but the cool
part check it out booty action oh baby
it's like a trendy chic tumblr
Cinderella doing the dishes look yeah
that's actually exactly what this is um
what else I didn't get too much oh yeah
I got these little uh cool little Sony's
except they're not even Sony's they're
just like little tumblr looking aviator
glasses ooh you know I just thought I
was kind of grooving plus for five bucks
you know why not
so that's steps in this isn't a tattoo
by the way they stamp your hand when you
go inside but anyways um oh and the last
thing I gots I couldn't help myself the
diamond D paperweight because you know
it wouldn't be my blog without something
sparkly and tada that is all of my loot
so there you have it you guys that is
the grand finale of my haul um thank you
