little bit but these are going to be
perfect perfect perfect love it well

popping into road they don't really
quick because hey I wanted to show you

ready to see some of my haul oh it's
still so Freeman in my house I finally
have air conditioning but I still don't
really know how to turn on here yet so
I'm just gonna keep my cool uh but I'm
gonna show you guys a couple of things
that I got so here we go tada this is
such a funny pile so I ended up getting
those cool column thingies you didn't
even have to spray-paint them because
they have like marks all over them but
you know whatever that's what you get
for 30 bucks
so these already looked so cool on my
flower wall so I think I'm gonna go
ahead and put them this way maybe I'll
just put them against the wall in
general they're just so cool I love it
on put some art here who knows whatever
I'll get creative next I got this little
guy I just thought this was such a fun
little container I'm gonna put roses in
it and put it somewhere I just loved it
I thought it was so fun very antique E
and gold which is kind of the vibe I'm
gonna go for in my bag
let's see walk over here I got its
baby's be told I don't even really know
what this is but I figured I could
totally use it for something and it was
only ten dollars so I'll find some sort
of crafty something to do with it
as for rugs is nope not buying another
one today because like you guys saw on
Twitter
my last rogue buying experience didn't
really go quite according to plan so I
think I'm just gonna order one online
for that to get like the exact
dimensions of that correct and then
final thing the grid the highlights of
the whole whole I'm ended up buying the
gold mirror because I loved it oh so so
much yeah let's unwrap this guy because
I want to see what he looks like
I'm gonna actually hang it on the wall
but um for now it's just gonna go here
because uh it's too heavy and I'm not
strong enough to hang it it's gonna be
so cool the instagrams in this are going
to be endless sir thank us we'll go
ahead and close this video out the same
way I started standing in a mirror so

of the journey and of course I will do a
fully furnished apartment tour when it's
