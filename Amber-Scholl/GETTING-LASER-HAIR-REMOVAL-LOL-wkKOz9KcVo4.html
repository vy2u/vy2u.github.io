hair removal journey Oh No okay so
what's up guys it's amber welcome back
to my channel so today as you guys know
I've been getting laser hair removal on
my underarms for the last I don't know
maybe like four or five months and you
guys have been asking if it hurts and
all these questions so I thought today I
would just take you along for the ride
so here we are alright guys so here we
are this is laseraway Beverly Hills um
this is where I go to get my hair uh
literally lasered away so this is the
inside look how cute it is it's like a
nice little Salani spa looking thing
they've got a baller chandelier up here
so yeah now just chill out here and wait
well they call me for my appointment in
our underarms all did fancy living um so
here we go this is what the room looks
like I know I know very high-tech kind
of doctor II looking but literally there
is nothing to be afraid of at all
alright so you'll just sit in the chair
like so ho
look at my pants they're like all groovy
match my hat any nosy I'm just waiting
for the technician to come in so she'll
be here in a sec
there's a lot of weird noises but
all right so yeah as you can see this is
the room and they're gonna give me some
groovy little goggles to wear so they
give you these really baller sunglasses
check it this is to protect your eyes
from the laser and to make you look
totally badass they will just wipe your
theater and off
this is such a weird video alright so
jazzing up the little laser thing just
chillax
like I said get my hair out of the way
how am I going to do this alright
pain is a zero
whoa all right Finn big on over the
other side here
that looks so funny
literally non-existent you guys as you
can see I'm completely unfazed with the
exception of Ireland fall
the end that's literally it
it was your underarms OB canard put
hydrocortisone under their desks even
Wells about antibiotics or anything like
that okay word well thank you so much
yeah it literally takes two seconds you
guys so as you saw that was the entire
procedure
well the appointment is over so I can
just leave it go about my day
goodbye Laser ready all right so there
you go as you can see that was literally
painless and so easy and took maybe five
minutes total so it is totally not a big
deal if you're thinking about it I 100%
recommend it because um you know shaving
is literally so annoying I personally
get horrifying razor burn under my arms
whenever I shave which is why I decided
to do this in the first place so
frequently asked questions um how many
treatments do you need I've personally
only had about five but the hair will
literally probably stop growing after
about three however you do need to keep
coming back for the full eight sessions
because that way it will never grow back
after that so that's that does it hurt
you saw no it doesn't hurt at all all
you need to do before you come there's
no sun exposure directly though on your
underarms like who has direct sun
exposure on your underarms anyway so
that's not a thought some no-brainer
there and the other thing is make sure
you shave before I know that sounds
silly doesn't it when you're coming to
get hair removal shave but no just make
sure you shave like 12 hours in advance
um because the laser will target the
hair follicles instead of like just the
excess hair I don't know I'm not a
scientist I don't know what the reason
is what they tell you to do that so do
that okay so how much does this cost
um this isn't exactly a budget-friendly
activity that one session runs about a
hundred and fifty dollars yikes but if
you buy a package of them it is cheaper
it's like six hundred and fifty I think
for eight sessions you need about eight
sessions so if you do the math on that
um I hate math why am I always doing
videos where I have to do math anyways
um I think that's like what more like a
hundred dollars a session
either way still kinda pricey however
are totally worth it to never ever have
to shave your underarms again PS you all
know I love a good budget-friendly
activity um couponing folks there's
group homes for this sort of thing
there's always some sort of promotion
going on so if you call and ask they're
really good about helping you pay for it
I know you can set up payment plans and
all sorts of things and also I see on
your Instagram they're always like 75%
off winter sale and summer sale and
spring cleaning sale so there's always
some way you can get a discount just
make sure you totally look into that
because I want you guys to save money
um I don't you you know busting the bank
over this but it is a worthwhile
activity so definitely look into it
if you have any other questions comments
concerns um or just want to say hi all
of my social media is at Amber shoal so
hit me up on there or of course comment
