welcome back to my channel so today um
you guys have asked a bajillion times to
do an everyday makeup routine
um and I haven't done it because I'm not
a professional makeup artist and I
really don't know what I'm doing when it
comes to makeup um however since you
asked here we go I'll answer your
command it's like a genie uh wish in a
bottle type thing so that didn't really
make too much sense but regardless here
we go
my everyday makeup routine alright now
before I even get started with this
video you guys I just want to preface it
by saying I'm not a makeup artist not
even close but um here we go the
completely unprofessional - it's for
people on how I beat my face alright so
as you can see we got nothing on my face
here yikes
um I do have eyelash extensions though
so those are on however I do those
myself so I'll show you a little
tutorial on those in the next few days
when I have a chance to film it so I
wash my face clean it off and then I get
started with some skin care all right so
the first thing I do is put on some
sunscreen because I don't want to get
wrinkles
um so this is Mario Badescu oil-free
moisturizer and I will literally just
rub that all over my face no rhyme or
reason and just put it all over next I
use primer because that helps everything
stay on all day I use dr. Brandt pore
refiner primer it's great um it just
gets rid of well it doesn't get rid of
your pores but it gets rid of the
appearance of pores anyway so again just
rub that in all over mm-hmm ha and I
pretty yet then I will do my foundation
I use Make Up For Ever foundation stick
from Sephora it's actually really pricey
it's like 50 bucks for this little thing
I'll just put this on my face with a
damp Beauty Blender um you can see it's
like literally a stick so I'll just rub
that on don't know mMmmm
yes now I do you see I look insane and
also my skin um you can see my neck is
like a totally different color than my
face so I use kind of a darker shade of
foundation so I just blend that all in
and then I feel like my skin looks more
luminous and Fabio
this covers like all the little
imperfections and I'll just put a little
on my neck to just to blend it in
because you don't want that like line
that looks gnarly go back to middle
school when we all had that um so yeah
dah
alright so next I'll do my concealer
this is tarte concealer um again I will
just squirt a little on my finger and
then put it where I think it's like
supposed to replicate light or something
I don't even know like I said I'm not
professional so I'll put it under my
eyes on the bridge of my nose and a
little bit here and here and here like I
don't know what I'm doing this is just
what I - you could so then again that
kind of like wakes you up at least I
feel like it wakes me up because despite
the fact that I get plenty of sleep um I
just always look tired so tada boom
alright so this is my favorite part of
doing makeup I do contour my face
everyday because it takes literally one
second and you look awesome so why not
so again I'll use the Make Up For Ever
HD stick this is color 180 it's
literally the darkest color that it
comes in as you can see it's not even
close to my skin tone um so that's what
I use to contour so I will just put that
in the areas um that I've seen other
youtubers put it so da da
here we go put on my cheeks mm-hmm
mm-hmm
on my forehead the bridge of my nose
just like an instant nose job by the way
alright so there we go you guys I'm done
that was my routine no kidding um so now
all you have to do is blend it in I'll
use like one of these little brushes um
and just kind of swirl it all around
because I'll a said I don't know what
I'm doing so just until it looks blended
so then the lines don't look as like
intense and crazy obviously um just
blend it in until it looks a little more
natural so there you go as you can see
it kind of gives your skin like almost
an ombre effect um I like always rub it
on my chin a little bit too because like
I said I don't like it to look too not
blended um and then you just get your
nose I use usually usually use my
fingers for this um I'm done
oh my gosh I just realized they never
painted my nails well oh well I'll do
that off to that later um so just blend
tap-tap-tap with a beauty lender so you
can't see as harsh of a line alright so
once that I blended it all together um
or at least you know sort of blended it
together um I will take this is makeup
forever Wow I really like makeup forever
I didn't realizes pro my favourite brand
I use it for everything this is the HD
pressed powder it's just like white
powder and a giant brush um it's
supposed to like I don't know I got it
for like filming stuff it was supposed
to like mattify your skin and make you
look better on camera does it work I
don't know but I will just kind of put
it all over my face to kind of just
blend it all together so there we go oh
yes
skin lookin on for Lake mm-hmm okay back
to business all right so as for eyes on
the daily basis I really don't do
anything to them I will actually just
take the brush that I use to put my
contour on and put a little bit on my
eyelid just the residuals because it
makes your eye look a little darker but
also like it's still totally natural
like as you can see just put a little
there you can barely see in this light
but one without one with and it just
kind of adds like what looks like a
natural hue tear eyelid like this could
totally be my skin tone but it's not so
BAM just do that to both eyes I don't
even know if you guys can see this I'm
sorry I've never done a makeup tutorial
I don't know how to do this all right
there we go yay
alright so also my eyes just to brighten
them up a little bit this is my favorite
pencil ever this is from wet &amp;amp; wild it's
99 cents at CBS and it's just a nude
pencil and to make my eyes look bigger I
will put that in the waterline oh my
gosh this looks so creepy I look like
demonic while I do this apologies guys
okay so I don't usually put mascara on
my top lashes obviously because I have
the extensions on and I don't need it
but my favorite um mascara in the world
is L'Oreal telescopic mascara a $9 CBS
doll I try not just wearing my videos
but as literally as the shoot you guys
um so I will just put that on my bottom
lashes because I feel like it makes my
eyes look bigger and more open alright I
couldn't get a full clear view
that's not doing selfie cam so here I am
favorite selfie cam as you can see the
bottom mascara killing it on there
really brightens and opens up your eyes
and now oh god I forgot I need to do my
eyebrows so here we go
eyebrows I'm known in my Instagram's for
having sick fluffy eyebrows like spit
pick will help you eyebrows so this is
how I create that illusion I'm in super
easy I'll do like an in-depth tutorial
about that at some point but I use
anastasia dipbrow pomade in Ebony and
this little pointed angle brush thing
and I'll literally just dip it in and
start to color on my eyebrows to my
liking so I'll just kind of draw in the
eyebrow to how I like it to be which is
really thick so I definitely over draw
it not sure if this is gonna stay
focused I apologize I don't really know
how to film a makeup tutorial like I
said but I'm trying there we go so after
a couple minutes of like filling it in
um that is how I like my eyebrows to be
so I'll just do the other eyebrow and
then continue on alright so now that I
got my Instagram eyebrows drawn on I'll
just use a gel to keep them in place um
I actually don't really like this gel
but this is a Milani easy brow tinted
brow gel from CBS L'Oreal has a better
one but they were out of stock at the
time that I was getting it so it's just
like a brown gel put it on kind of like
mascara just to hold those puppers in
place I'm so sorry if you guys are like
bored out of your minds um I won't do
any more makeup videos if you don't ask
this was kind of like a trial video
because I don't got so many requests for
it and then I was like I don't really
know how to do makeup but anyways here
we go tada okay so eyebrows done bada
bing been moving along this is my
favorite part of doing my makeup this is
what isn't all my Instagram says like
that POW of glowy sunshine awesomeness
um this is Anastasia Beverly Hills um
what is this called so Hollywood
illuminator I die for this stuff it is
my favorite um as you can see it mines
like cracked and disgusting because I
use it so much but doesn't stop me from
using it so I will just put this on my
cheeks and a lot of it I'm very
heavy-handed with this because I like
the extra extra flouncy glow but you're
not really supposed to use that much but
you know what who cares about the rules
so I will just tap that on the apples of
my cheeks
oh look at it it's so beautiful I'll
also put it on the bridge of my nose and
the tip of my nose again this makes your
nose look cuter I'll also put it right
here I don't know why I do that but
let's make your lips look bigger I think
I read that somewhere I'll also put it
on the inside of my tear ducts and
underneath my brow oh my god I love this
stuff and there we go now we got that
shiner Instagram ho glow sorry I get too
excited about this it's like ridiculous
I could literally put on highlight all
day like I'm done but you know what more
more more more if I would just like be
one giant shiny cupcake if I had my way
but try anyways umm let's see what do I
do next
alright now I usually don't put on blush
but if I do I will for purposes of today
but this is NARS orgasm it is my I know
right at the name I'd wink if I could
wink properly but I can't so anyways
I'll just tap that on really lightly
it's kind of like an iridescent shade
but it's really pretty so I'll just put
that on a little bit fabulous okay
alright next is I'm obsessed with my
lips I literally love drawing them on
and making them look huge and full like
pouty Instagram style
this is so embarrassing actually
literally I wasn't planning on filming
this video today and I just like woke up
and decided to do it so I didn't like
update any of my products or clean them
or get new ones of things that are
literally nubs but as you can see
everything is well well-loved in my
household so this is NYX lip liner in
mauve dye love it I always just put this
all over my lips it's a great nude shade
umm it's hard to do this without a
mirror but you get the gist I'll
literally just color it all on I also
like to throw in a gloss this is like
some plumping lip gloss from Sephora
nah all right there we go now that I've
got everything all done urban decay
southern spray this will change your
life this will make your makeup stay on
all day long
um I used to be like this is a hoax
what's really in there cuz like the main
ingredient is water um but I ran out of
it one time and didn't wear it for like
three days and I swear to you what my
face felt like it was melting off so
this is the bomb I will just spray
through sprays and we are done mm-hmm
all right there you guys that is how I
do my everyday makeup um it's nothing
too special like I said I'm not a
professional at all I learned myself off
of YouTube and obviously I do like a lot
more glam looks on insta and stuff too
but for my every day-to-day life this is
it um so thanks so much for watching
