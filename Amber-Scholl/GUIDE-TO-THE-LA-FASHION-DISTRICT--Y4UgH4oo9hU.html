with my pitbull Mariah we are going to
the fashion district yeah hello say hi
hi we both got our braids in so it is
early on Saturday morning and we are
going to go on an adventure because she
has never been to the Bastian district
which is my all-time favorite place in
the world so I mean that sounds dramatic
I like Disney World and like I like the
beach but whatever for shopping this
place is a Bobo home so I'll show you
where to go what to buy what kind of
money I bring because I'm an expert at
this so in case you've ever wondered
here's the tour let's do it Wow
alright we are approaching as you can
see it is kind of like flea market II
yeah keep going straight just keep kick
Jordan straight babe alright but yeah
you can see it's kind of flea market II
out here and there's a lot of places to
park and a lot of things in the road so
be careful but super busy and I'll show
you the best place best place to park
all right
boom our more here alright guys so we're
here this is where you park 10:13 South
Los Angeles Street
oh here I'll actually show you the signs
better
they have a little lot right here on the
weekends it's $10 all day so kind of
pricey but this is the cheapest lot that
exists and is the safest to leave your
car so there you go
mind you it's cash only so we had to go
to ATM yeah remember to bring cash
important tip set our matching black
pants and shoes cool and check this out
how fun
oh this car just ruins my shot but they
have these on the floor and it's really
cool the end okay here we go
flower please thank you yeah we can go
there alright here we go we are
approaching the fashion district this is
it as you can see it looks a little bit
like a flea market very crowded because
we're going to Saturday so my advice if
you can is not to come on a weekend
because there's less people and the
parking is cheaper but literally so much
stuff look at it all yeah and everything
is so achieved look at this three hats
for ten bucks
amazing bump up boom boom boom boom
right here we are at our destination
Santee alley
you know you can make funny faces and
sign up so yes this is Dancy alley
this is where all of the good stuff is I
will show you how to get around and
where to go because this is where you
want to get
all right so here is a little look at
Santee alley you can say it's kind of
like a flea market a little bit but um
also not really it's like a bunch of
little stores kind of set off into each
other got a lot of kiosks with some
really cool cheap sunglasses that I'm
totally gonna buy later weird graphic
tees of course my favorite amazing shoe
stores some weird stuff too but they
literally have everything here so as I
said before if not for the faint at
heart but definitely a good time they
have fantastic workout pants just FYI I
buy these all the time there are little
low quality but you know they make your
booty look amazed and three four ten
whoo by the way one of the coolest
things about this place is they
literally have all the naked palettes
they have mac makeup all sorts of stuff
and it's literally nine dollars not sure
where they get it from but it's totally
the real thing I bought it before
sidenote these are the best if you're
here you have a little kiosk store
called the alley dog they're like little
yogurts movies fantastic more
importantly look at the selection of
sunglasses everything you ever wanted in
your whole blue like these are super
cute
Oh like literally these are $5 each
$5.00 wondering where I get my Prada
sunglasses from this is where you're
wondering where I always get my ball in
phone cases this is where check out all
of these
and that's not where the selection ends
it just goes on and on forever so many
the whole store she's gonna be a human
everything and fake hair if you're
interested but mostly look at this and
this is just one place I'm telling you
this is where to go
all right so also if you're randomly
looking for a hair extensions or wigs
this is the place to come
look at them all I used to buy hair
extensions here for years and they're
really great too and mucho cheaper than
you would get at the store so amber is
about to try on a nice blonde wig for
fun you know okay we'll see how she
looks as a blondie probably really ugly
but and this is how it's done
because you looks like you're the one on
the street looking yes that one
oh my god you look so cute
you just stole our way we got these wigs
by the way our super cheap you can get
them for like 35 bucks so so we're gonna
see if I want one this look is so good I
knew this is Ally friend
let's see how she looks if I can string
this okay yeah no no it's fine hey girl
you look too shabby I actually like it
yeah you look cute there's a mirror been
a joke I gotta see that I'm so amazed I
probably not gonna go oh my god you look
super cute
hopefully I think you want to I think
you should do it it is so cute what do
you guys think I'm blond amber are we
Kylie Jenner yet honestly you look great
as a gray really no it looks good how
about does she look I love it how about
me as a blue though there no hmm I
wonder if I came home and my white
friends would be like oh could you just
died look at all of this stuff oh my god
I live for this I just live for this
tiara I know right look at how amazing
like if you need anything for your fancy
events wow wow wow
I note this is where I get my inkless
from cute
tada love it doh okay so you guys know
how much I'm obsessed with my fuzzy
keychain granted don't buy the real fur
ones because I'm a vegetarian I don't
like that but the faux fur ones are
amazing like literally I'm dead I'm
gonna totally buy this one how cute it
and check it out
everything is always on sale here now
that my keys are all in order
let's keep throw-in
way there are in fact real stores here
like this is one of the nicer areas but
yeah this is super cute they have lots
of fun things all sorts of trendy kind
of things that you see like the
Kardashians wearing they have a lot of
knock-offs
so it's tons of fun if you need anything
for an event or whatever
lots of good good quality things in here
and it's all really cheap so I mean it's
not as cheap as the vendor stores
outside but still cheap so you can
probably get a full outfit for like
thirty dollars like look at this girl I
would totally wear this you're killing
it babe slay okay side note i buy
literally all of my Halloween costumes
here every year as you can tell it's not
much of a costume but I like to make the
match this is where I get all of that
kind of fun jazz
all right presenting the reason that I
come to the fashion district this man in
the corner no I'm just kidding it
literally Lola's Shoetique these shoes
are fantastic and so cheap and amazing I
bought literally all of my shoes here
whoo check it out
like oh my god they're amazing
just look at these
walls of to heaven literally wall
insane so also if you're ever in town
literally they have the most amazing a
formal we're here I could just die this
is where I get all of my red carpet he
looks if you guys ever need them so
check it out everything you ever wanted
but in real life instead of online look
at the detailing on this
I'm like screaming dying look at this
dress oh my god I need to wear this like
literally everywhere
anyways side note goals if anyone wants
to buy this for me I'll send you my
address I'm kidding no I'm not okay and
if you're a guy they do in fact have
guys clothing too granted it's a little
bit la douchebag status but they do have
men's clothing okay okay so as you can
tell I did end up buying this wig
because I thought it was so fun and it
was like 35 dollars so why not um so
thoughts on the fashion district
mariahlynn it was a lot of fun I really
liked it
there was a lot of good tales honey my
expert opinion we don't really look like
twins anymore because now I look crazy
but um I got a little bodies - oh yeah
it's like $12 I try to haggle it for ten
but yeah it was a good time so so good
