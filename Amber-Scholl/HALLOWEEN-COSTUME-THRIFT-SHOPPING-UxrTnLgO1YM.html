off but anyways I love love love love
love Halloween any excuse to dress up is
cool by me but as you guys know I also
don't like to break the bank especially
when it's like you know a one night
outfit so I thought it would be fun to
go on another thrift shopping adventure
to see what kind of goodies we can come
up with for cheap umm I don't know why I
look like some kind of weird glowy ghost
thing maybe there is paranormal activity
in here so here we go a very extra
Halloween shopping adventure
macklemore's style at the thrift shop
oh well it's always before we get going
here is our outfit of the day I really
wanted to turn on some like witchy
Halloween vibes for this one because you
know to be in the spirit haha get it get
in the spirit
this is just a fun little black
turtleneck dress so cute cotton very
cheap as well it's very simple actually
today we just went ahead and paired it
with some witch themed boots oh look how

the day I really do look like a witch in

our way this is my good friend clay I
