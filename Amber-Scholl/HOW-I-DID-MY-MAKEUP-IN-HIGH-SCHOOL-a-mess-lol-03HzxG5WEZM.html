voluminous and fun but both my face it's
totally bare because we're doing a
makeup video what is up you guys
it's amber welcome back to my channel
and today like I just said we're doing
two makeup video but we're going to do
it high school style a bunch of you guys
asked what I was like in high school
well my makeup look like so I thought
alright hop on the bandwagon trend and
do a video showing you how I did my
makeup in high school because let me
tell you it was pretty funny
and since life's all about growing and
learning anyway I gotta take this
opportunity to chat a little bit about
confidence and self-expression and being
yourself so without further ado here we
go a blast from the past how I did my
makeup in high school
all right so we're just gonna get right
into it
tada this is what I look like in high
school
so needless to say my makeup game wasn't
super strong but you can see look at the
smile on my face I loved it I thought it
looked just fabulous
I wore this look every single day so
we're just gonna go ahead and uh
recreate this beauty so I am so excited
to be partnering with a super cool
company called sleek makeup who is all
about creativity and self-expression and
inclusivity so I just thought this was
like the perfect brand to help me with
this video so though I'm gonna be doing
a full face of sleek today but we'll
save the good stuff for the end for now
we're gonna bust out my high school
makeup for this blast from the past
alrighty so we're just gonna go ahead
and start off with a nice bare face
because we're supposed to be 16 in this
video alright dot foundation and rub
that all in Oh flawless what nice
foundation this is so then we're gonna
go ahead and take blush and put it all
over our cheeks not just on the apples
everywhere all over them now we're gonna
do my eyes I would always take a nice
white shade and put it all over the brow
bone and really just everywhere that it
wasn't supposed to go then I would blend
it in because that totally fixed it
nothing says subtle everyday quite like
blacks I was basically the inventor of
the cut crease James Charles who I am
the queen of makeup yes perfect exactly
how I shadow is supposed to look we need
it to be a little more natural so we're
gonna go ahead and line it and
underneath the eye and of course we got
to add eyeliner because the look was a
little too subtle so we got to add black
liner on the top and of course you know
black liner in the waterline too liquid
liner in the waterline yep that's what I
used to do and everyone knows no look is
complete without brows so we are just
going to pencil in our brows with black
eye shadow pay no mind to what shape
they should be just go ahead and color
them in then I would go ahead and add
mascara layered on coated on add some
false lashes to increase drama and the
top of the whole look we're going to add
frosty pink lipstick because that is
exactly what I used to do and that my
friends is how I did my makeup in high
school yes everyday everyday
oh my gosh this is actually so funny I
have not looked like this in so many
years Wow this I shadow was always such
a mood I thought you know for my 8:00
a.m. classes I loved it so I hope you
enjoyed that funny tutorial however I
just wanted to take this moment to say
you guys this is actually a very very
important video to me I used to get made
fun of all the time in high school for
my makeup Snooki
cake face clowns someone once called me
the 99-cent lipstick girl and I
literally never forgot it
and even though I'm laughing at it now
because you know how could you know I
got a good chuckle out of this it always
really really hurt at the time um so I
just wanted to go ahead and say that
even though my bio has evolved
throughout the years like you guys can
see here my more current routine using a
full face from my good friends over at
sleek makeup my foundation got less
orange my contouring is slightly more
professional mm-hmm
my eyeshadow palettes went from icy to
golden like wow look at the pigmentation
so sparkly my eyebrows are most
certainly a lot less suit labelee and
you know much more flaky my mascara is
fiercer my lashes got even longer my
lips and ever so slightly more subtle
like this color oh my god I love and my
highlight a little more poppin like OMG
what the it's tohoku lower than baby
here Wow oh yes perfect for the crab but
truth be told it's cliche but true
what's on the inside is what matters the
most my favorite beauty tip of all has
always been that beauty is in the eye of
the beholder
I loved my look in high school I love my
look now so I never really let any of
the mean comments get to me makeup is a
way to feel fabulous and to show the
world who you are through your own
self-expression so never let anyone tell
you what's right or wrong like the
beautiful folks over at sleek say it's
your face your rules you do what you
want and if that's unblended black
eyeshadow with frosty pink lipstick you
go girl or boy no gender stereotypes
here either thank you guys so much for
watching I love you guys so so so so
much stay uniquely wonderfully
beautifully you what million kisses for
me today and of course from high school
amber to you this is still next time you
guys excel
okay but honestly I'm actually starting
to like this again frosty pink lips
really are such a mood maybe I'll go
