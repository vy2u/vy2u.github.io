morning I still don't know what I'm
doing with it like what even but
whatever what's up guys it's amber and
welcome back to my channel so today I'm
going to be answering my must ask
question ever on social media which is
amber how do you edit your Instagram
photos so we're just going to get right
into it because there's lots to teach
you guys today so here we go how amber
edits her Instagram photos the master
class all right you guys tada this is my
Instagram umm it's at amber Scholl if
you want to follow me um so here we go
this is what my feed looks like right
now I think this is one of my favorites
that it ever looked like I'm very into
like the dark colors with the high
contrast right now I've had a lot of
different themes and I'll show you the
importance of themes in a second but for
now I'll just show you how I edit some
of my pictures and because this is what
I get the most questions on so people
are always surprised when I say this but
my favorite photo editing app is
literally Instagram so I will just
directly open my whatever photo I want
to post up in Instagram something like
the Eiffel Tower that I took this is an
absolutely fantastic photo in and of
itself but um I will just again my go-to
filter Aidan oh look at that then I'll
just play around with all the things the
lux actually looks fantastic on this and
then I will just hit done it really
takes two seconds to make your photo
look fabulous really quick to-- okay
here we go now this is what I know you
really want to know about this is how I
edit my selfies um so here we go this is
when a selfie that I took when I was in
London this last few weeks um so this is
the original photo I have a great camera
which is why the quality is so high on
this um but here is how the finished
edited photo came out so you can see
they look different but it's mostly just
in the lighting and the coloring so this
is how I edit AddThis um to look like
this alright so like I said I have a
folder on my phone literally dedicated
to photo editing I only have a couple of
apps I don't really use that money but
when I'm doing a selfie my first thing
that I do is I use perfect 365 which is
actually a really weird app they
literally have crazy make up things they
can do to your face
I'm just by clicking on a button which
is actually really fun but it looks fake
so I definitely don't recommend using
this like okay interesting but it's kind
of fun if your fridges like want to
screw around
it's kind of cool but we never never
actually use those so original but I do
use it for tools and I will use it to
edit my skin this so if I want to soften
the skin like you can see my skin is
just like you can see the little ruffles
in it I actually have pretty good skin
but um I will soften the skin by just
spreading on the soft and skin button
and then I will amp that up so you can
see that just kind of removes lose all
the little imperfections BAM there we go
now I have soft smooth flawless skin so
I will just save that and continue along
alright so like I said I really like the
Photoshop app however I really don't use
it that much the only things I will use
it for is when there's something
specific I want to do like I will use it
to flip the image sometimes like if I
decide I like this picture but I think
I'd rather like it like this which I
don't but sometimes I do
the Photoshop is a great way you can
flip the images so that's fun anyways um
what I really use it for though is this
I use it for it to adjust the tint and
the temperature of the photo because
here you can see it's like very yellow
kind of and I will use the tint which
you can auto tint it but sometimes it
doesn't work like right there barely did
anything but if you want to really
adjust the coloration of the photo I
will always use that like here you can
see I'm making it way greener and here I
will make it a little bit more of a cool
tone so when editing a selfie that's
literally all I will do then I will go
over to Instagram and you can see oh hi
guys hi um so when I want to edit the
photo I will usually do most of my
editing in Instagram which I know is
super weird but literally that is what I
do so here we go you can see my picture
now is the softened scan version great
it's ready to go so I'll just hit next
and then my go to filter for every
single picture Aidan
tada look at that and that is basically
all I do to it to make it look like that
um I do like to mess around with this
sometimes because oh not for this
picture though apparently yikes that's
always a hit or miss I like that one but
it depends um so I will also once I put
Aiden on it and then I will go to the
Edit and then I'll just mess around with
these because these are actually great
and I feel like people don't really
utilize them enough the editing in
instagram is actually awesome
so I'll just just mess around with these
I'll just test them all out see if I
like the way it looks versus with it or
without I do have like a weird OCD thing
so no matter what looks the best I will
always only set it to thirteen because
I'm crazy so there we go
thirteen okay so done so if I decide I
like highlights I will always set it to
thirteen if I decide I like the
saturation to be increased I will always
set it to thirteen though clearly you
would not do that here it means almost
like poop so that is how I will edit the
picture you can always see what it looks
like before and then after just by
clicking on it like that and if you want
to see just the difference between one
thing like here we go you can see the
contrast if I screw with that if you
want to see just the effect of the
contrast you can click on it so that's
what it looks like without the contrast
or with the contrast and that's what it
looks like without it so you can see the
before and after with just that one
effect which is cool but if you want to
see the whole thing obviously just go
back to the regular setting and you can
see before and after
fabulous and then of course I will share
it with you babes but doesn't spell love
you but it's fine okay anyways let's
exit that out so I don't accidentally
post this also you guys are always
asking about my Instagram highlight how
I make it look so poppin I have a
tutorial on that I wear a lot of
highlight this is not normal looking in
real life like it really looks crazy on
a day to day basis but in photos it
looks frickin awesome
which is why I wear so much of it but
the way that I make it pop like this is
I always take these photos with flash so
the light reflects off it really
intensely which is why it shines super
bright in photos so this isn't actually
any editing technique this is just me
using a flash in the picture so here we
go this is one of my most famously
highlighted photos um like I said it's
important like when you're taking
pictures if you want the colors to
really look like this is use the flash
photography because natural light isn't
going to give you this it's definitely
when overexposed flash so you can see
the highlight is popping right there and
you can see it's there and you can see
the really cool lens flare that happens
when you take a flash on crystal however
the opposite of what you might think is
when you are editing highlight to make
it look more highlighting as you will
still use the highlight effect this is
on Photoshop expressed by the way and
you will actually decrease the highlight
to make it pop out more so you can see
it is decreasing everything so it makes
just these specific spots that are
already really highlighted pop out so
you can see what it looks like before
versus after and that is how I get that
extra highlighted glow tada bye umm
bitch your ha lot is poppin alright so
another question I always get asked is
how I make the backgrounds of all my
pictures the same here you can see one
of my most recent ones where I D
saturated the background and this is how
I do that there you go you can see the
original image now this is what I will
use Snapseed for is when I want to
change the color of the background like
this whole picture is really cool but I
don't like this purple hue because it
wouldn't match so you can just take this
little button right here and I will do I
don't really know what any of the rest
of these do I only know this so I will
hit selective and then it kind of just
will draw a little dot and you can see
it covers what the red you can like move
the size of it whatever so
I'll make it pretty big because I want
it to be the whole wall here and then
you can edit the contrast the saturation
or the brightness depending on what you
scroll on I want to do saturation
because I obviously don't want it to be
this purple color so I want to delete
the saturations you can see now it's
like gray and then you can just move
multiple little dots until you get all
of them to be the less saturated
versions once you have all of it you can
just hit yes and then you can see the
before with all of that purple tones and
then you can see the after with none of
them so that is how I will make all my
backgrounds look similar
so my Instagram has really evolved over
the years this was it back circa 2012 my
first picture ever of a Greek salad
and oh god some really embarrassing
selfies um anyways I should really
delete these but I've never deleted a
big drop my Instagram so you know
whatever if you care to scroll back here
you can see some really quality imagery
of a bunch of trash apparently that I
felt was important to post so so what is
the importance of an Instagram aesthetic
well there really isn't one unless you
really care about this sort of thing but
if you want to see what you might feed
looked like before this is where it was
just like a hodgepodge I did not care
about what it looked like cohesively
together at all I was just posting
pictures as I wanted which um I mean
they're cute pictures but they don't go
together as you can see it just as like
the data like there's no relationship it
doesn't look like an art gallery if you
will it just looks more like nothing but
anyways so here you can see I started to
care about an aesthetic um probably I
don't know up towards here is where I
started to kind of care a little bit I
was like okay so you can see I kind of
did like similar color scheme here and
it looks way better than it did before
like this is a mess and here you can see
this is just kind of a little more
cohesive like all the colors go together
the pinks and the the whites and it
looks nice but it's still not really
that great then I got really into it and
I've had like a coppery aesthetic where
every single picture um is the same
color which is or I mean it's not
exactly the same color but they all have
the same scheme like you have brown lips
here I'm wearing brown here gold on my
eyes brown on the flowers so that's one
way to make a theme is to take pictures
that are all similar colors however this
took so much time and I got
sick of it so quick I end up having to
change it all the time so this scare you
can see I switched it to blacks and reds
but again this takes so much time and
it's honestly just not worth it to me so
now I've switched to what I do now which
is up here which is I just take pictures
that I like and then I edit them to make
sure they look decent next to each other
so is there really a theme going on here
not really but um I still think they
look really great like you can see these
two pictures really go well together and
then these three really go good together
so and you can see this one that just
totally messed up my feed but this is
one of my favorite photos of all times
thank you guys for following you I love
you um so any newsy here we go a my
number one tip for making a theme is use
the same filter for every single photo
because no matter what you take a
picture of it'll start to look cohesive
so like this literally is Aiden this is
Aiden this is Aiden
this is Aiden this is Aiden and guess
what guys this is Aiden so when you use
the same filter no matter what you're
taking a picture of it will all start up
kind all sort of start to kind of blend
together and look like a more cohesive
feed so just random tip in general
flowers are stinking beautiful and add
aesthetic to any feed like I love taking
pictures of roses because they're just
so pretty they're my favorite flower in
the first place but um they're just
they're so beautiful and they totally
make any feed look great like look at
these beautiful beautiful beautiful and
they just really like bring together so
any color scheme like here was doing
pink like I said or the Browns or the
Reds so they can just really make
anything pop and it's an easy way to
brighten up your feed so I know there's
actual apps for this but when it comes
to planning my feed I like visco care of
the best because it just is easiest for
me to do and I like the fact that you
can edit kind of in the app so I will
just import the photo that I'm about to
import next so you can see these are all
my pictures that I already have and the
next photo that I want to import I want
to just go ahead and add that photo so
here we go you can see there's the
finished one there's unedited one and
there's N and N 1 so I will just hit
this and that will import it into the
feed um and then you can see how it's
going to look of course I already have
this photo in here but you can still see
alright so that looks nice and then I'll
just see if I like the way that it looks
if I decide I don't like it you can just
delete it really easy to delete and it's
gone but you can plan out your whole
feed like this like if I have like the
next four pictures that I want to post
this and this I can just put them all in
there and then I can see what the whole
next row of my Instagram is going to
look like this is what my Instagram
already is and here's if I added those
three pictures up so that looks nice of
course they're all duplicates of photos
I already have which looks a little
weird but you can see the theme is still
cohesive and that is why I use this app
in the first place so um there you go
that's how I planned my feed it's
nothing too crazy but that is how I do
it so have you guys I know it's not like
the most interesting thing in the world
but um those are my tricks and tips so I
hope you guys enjoyed as always if you
have any questions comments concerns all
my socials are at amber shoal though you
probably knew that based on watching
