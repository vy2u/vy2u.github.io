back to my channel so today look at this
we're featuring a little cute pom-pom
hello
this is actually my friend's dog but I
thought this video would be more fun if
we had a pup unit so here we go
greetings from me and juicy say hi juicy
so anyways um this video is actually not
about this dog this video is about
something else
can you guess cheese I am finally gonna
be answering the question of how I keep
my teeth so white because you guys keep
asking and the answer is no I have never
had them professionally whitened ever in
my life just like all things I'm cheap
and do it myself at home so here we go
how I whiten my teeth
jeez can you smile puppy oh yes thank
you so first things first I actually
well a I have a lot of dog hair on my
fingers but second ball I have a really
fancy electric toothbrush um you can see
it's like you just press a button and
then the bristles kind of move so it's
like this is like actually the male
version cuz it's black but you know what
forget gender stereotypes I wanted the
black one because I thought it was cuter
umm yeah also I use this toothpaste I've
been using this forever what is this
even called a Colgate optic white
toothpaste supposed to be whiter teeth
in one week which is why I bought it I
don't know if this actually works or not
but I guess the proof is in the pudding
I also once a night I will wash my mouth
with mouthwash any mouthwash is fine
this is just what I use what is this
crest ProHealth advanced I don't know
it's like five dollars I think gets CBS
alright so for how I actually whiten my
teeth um you guys are always asking me
about this I have never actually had my
teeth professionally whitened ever I do
it at home because cheaper and easier
and I Loki have fun doing it which I
know sounds weird but regardless um so
I've used a bunch of drugstore products
over years nothing really worked that
great so when I saw Kylie Jenner was
promoting a certain brand I was like
well I don't try that too because y'all
know that I love Kim in the Kardashians
and I just think they have all sorts a
great beauty secrets so if they were
using it I thought I would try it out
too so i go went ahead and ordered
myself a box but this is hi
my own teeth whitening kit this is what
I've been using for the last little
while now I actually really like it it
works super great so I thought this is
what I would share with you guys today
since you asked so here we go this is
how you use it how we get a nice pearly
what's so yes this particular part of
the video is sponsored by hi smile
however only because I emailed them
after already liking the product so yes
this is what I really use and yes this
is what I really recommend just so you
guys know I feel like The Price is Right
model whoo here we have this you guys
yes um so if you guess the right thing -
oh here we go this is what the kit looks
like it comes with the three little
syringes and this little light-up thing
and then also this you can see mine is
actually really dirty because I use it
all the time and so it has like lipstick
stains on it what can you do what all
you have to do is take this this and one
of the little syringes you will just put
go ahead and pop this on the little
mouthpiece here you're going to pop the
mouthpiece onto little bleach thingy
so literally all you have to do is this
it's so easy
well it's so easy if you're not me and
you don't have really long nails because
everything is hard when I have long
nails like honestly I have to ask people
to help me get my credit card out of the
meters when I'm paying down in West
Hollywood because parking always cost an
arm on leg here so whenever I like stick
my credit card in I literally have to
ask passing by strangers who are like
walking your dog or something to help me
get my credit card back out of the meter
so that's embarrassing anyways long nail
problems so regardless looks great so
here we go okay so once you have this
attached onto this thing all you'll do
is you'll take the little teeth
whitening gun thing here looks like a
little syringe you get to play doctor I
actually used to want to be a doctor so
this is kind of fun so then you will
just squirt half the syringe um into the
top here like so you can see that a
little bit and then you'll also squirt a
little bit into the bottom like that and
that's literally all you do you guys and
all you're gonna do is stick it in your
mouth
mmm beautiful and then just turn it on
candor stand me probably not
whatever here we go octo button this is
so unflattering I can only get a back
shot hmm we can she
and then you can hear it'll just beep
when it's done so you can just take it
out of your mouth tada um feel free to
rinse your mouth and like brush your
teeth when you're done just to make sure
there's no like extra bleep John there
because there usually is but I don't
feel like getting up right now so I'm
just going to like wipe it off on this
beautifully elaborate paper towel
anyways um that is how I keep my teeth
white with a little whitening kit um I
do it about twice a year sometimes three
times a year you're really only supposed
to do it once but my dentist oh he says
that's bad and you're not supposed to do
that but I think the results speak for
themselves
take that dentist so there have you guys
that is how I wake my teeth um I hope
that answers all of your questions and
as always if you have any more go ahead
comment below I will answer as many as I
can
um also tweet me snap me Instagram me
whatever floats your fancy I love
interacting with you guys on there so um
yeah I guess that's it I love you guys
so very much I hope you have a wonderful
happy holidays and an even better new
year and I will see you guys super soon
um I love you I love you I love you I
love you I love you so sending a million
kisses from me and juicy to you but this
is still next time you guys XO
give him a kiss juicy no give them a
kiss okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
