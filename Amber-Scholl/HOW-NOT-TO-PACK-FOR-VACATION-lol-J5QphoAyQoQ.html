should be just enough actually one more
okay perfect
this would be a lot funnier if I was
kidding but I'm not I literally have to
go buy a bigger luggage like right after
this is up you guys amber welcome back
to my channel it's your host dr. amber
Scholl PhD in extra with a minor in
sucking at packet but seriously I'm the
absolute worst Packer I have ever met in
my entire life everything from makeup
socks basic necessities if you can name
it I've forgotten it but never shoes I
always remember the shoes so today I
thought I'd go ahead and fill my packing
adventure because I am literally leaving
the continent um tomorrow I screamed so
wide in this clip I had to cut audio out
but needless to say I'm excited
so anyways compose myself here's I can
film this video uh since my flight is a
literally less than 24 hours I need to
start packing so without further ado
here we go how not to pack for vacation
featuring yours truly the worst Packer
ever
numero uno don't meet until the day
before your trip to buy a luggage this
one seems obvious but I did it
Tupperware and your 10000 shopping bags
won't do the trick on a plane honey buns
so buy a luggage ahead of time if you
insist on waiting till the day before
like me to order one on Amazon at least
three the dimensions what you're
ordering otherwise you will end up with
tiny luggage mcgee who only fits one
pair of shoes ah don't worry you can
order his big brother and rush shipping
but still it's much easier to just avoid
that situation from the beginning like
remember when you accidentally ordered
the perfume bottle that was only one
inch tall oh ampere when will you learn
numero dos make sure your clothes are
clean this seems like it'd be simple
enough but alas I procrastinate doing my
laundry for way longer than should be
allowed and now all I have is piles of
dirty clothes to pack oops I mean I
guess you could just pack the dirty
clothes but you don't want to get there
and just have a bunch of stay into
clothing options so do your laundry
beforehand not the day before you leave
the continent next tip don't forget
about things you actually need I know it
seems like you need that glittery dress
you've never worn and possibly the piano
stool but really you don't what you do
need are the things you actually need
like underwear which where did all of my
dough I don't know but I just had to go
to Victoria Secret to buy some so I had
some for this trip I'll have to keep
better track of these so I don't lose
them for the next one next on the list
print your travel Docs ahead of time I
literally hate going to the print
centers but it looks like I'm stuck
going to the print Center because the
last printer I had well let's just say
it had an accident this tweet is a true
story I literally was on the phone with
tech when I opened my printer only to
discover there was somehow a thong
inside maybe that's where all my
underwear wine don't try to pack all of
your shoes just some of them I never
listen to this rule I always try to pack
all of them and honestly it's fine more
the merrier you never know which ones
you're gonna want but uh the only
Broadway is when you try to pack the
things that you actually need like a
toothbrush none of it fits next tip
don't wait till the last possible minute
to buy a refill of your makeup when you
know you've already been almost out of
it for weeks why do you do this amber
why every girl knows that once your
makeup has nothing in it you can still
scrape like two to three days out of it
but not two weeks like
you've been trying to do so it's just
not possible anymore and now instead of
cleanly packing up your makeup into a
travel case or at Sephora wasting
valuable packing time but at least it's
fun in here so it's fine next tip don't
randomly decide you want to hang
curtains in your apartment and waste
half the day doing that the closest Bed
Bath and Beyond is 40 minutes away why
are we going there I don't know but
since I suck at time management I
decided we were gonna do this today
anyway and boom honestly it looks great
I'm not even mad the week before you
leave the country yep true story I lost
my driver's license last week I have no
idea where it went but I discovered it
was missing out at a bar with my friends
it had to Google myself to get in which
I thought I was pretty creative and also
really funny that it actually worked but
something tells me TSA and Border Patrol
probably wouldn't have been as chill so
don't do that so finally as my mom would
say make a list lists are great for
keeping track of things and staying on
track I wouldn't really know because I
don't usually keep lists and might not
usually keep lists I mean I never keep
lists but first trip across the globe I
figured it would definitely probably
come in handy and keep me from banging
things I don't need there's hot boys in
Australia you don't need that next step
you don't need 10 outfits for everyday
you just need one or maybe two but not
ten like are going to the beach so I
don't really need that glittery gout I
need a bikini and some shorts and some
sneakers and a fur coat wait what no you
don't need it for a coat amber put that
back
save it for dancing in front of your
mirrors or a lookbook or something okay
I know this is a lost cause whatever
just take it so there you have you guys
that is how not to pack for a vacation
um honestly funny story this was
actually going to be a vlog but I
realized when I started doing it that I
was missing half the stuff that I needed
and I didn't even own a luggage that was
like properly suited to film this so
that's why it turned into this weird
little video so I hope you enjoyed that
little mockery of my own self hopefully
someone can relate it to my horrible
packing skills right yeah I'm the only
one No please don't tell me okay
okay thank you guys so much for watching
I will see you beautiful babes in
Australia I am so so so excited you guys
know I've been dying to go to Australia
for like basically my entire life so I
can't wait since the trip was the last
minute
not doing an official meetup or anything
but I will we have the Royal Botanic
Gardens and Sydney on Sunday from 4:30
to 5:30 so if you want to pop in and say
hi I'll be there with my friends taking
instant pictures for like an hour so go
ahead swing on in if you want to say it
Aloha I know that's Hawaii but you know
tropical I'll be vlogging the trip too
so stay tuned for those videos coming to
a YouTube screen near you I love you
guys so very much if you're new don't
forget to subscribe to the channel for
lots more fun shenanigans you love you
guys kisses till next time see you soon
Australia Excel okay but I actually
really don't know how to pack so this is
just gonna have to do mostly because I
stayed up all night editing this video
instead of actually packing so we have
no choice but uh I'm ready for you
Australia boys I'm ready</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
