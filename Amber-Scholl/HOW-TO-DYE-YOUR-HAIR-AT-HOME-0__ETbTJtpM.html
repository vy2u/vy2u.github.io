amber welcome back to my channel so
today we're going to be doing a little
bit DIY hair dye because I got my hair
at home and when I was first initially
had never done it I was so nervous and
so afraid and I wished it there was like
more videos recommending products and
showing people how to do it so today I
thought I would show you guys how I dye
my hair at home with the courtesy of my
favs john frieda so here we go alright
so this is my favorite brand this is
john frieda precision foam color in the
color luminous natural black I've never
actually used this dark of a shade
before but I was really gonna go for the
Kardashian kind of look today so this is
what we are going to use alright so when
you open the box it comes with a lot of
things it looks overwhelming but really
it's not they have an extraction guide
some rubber gloves but for the actual
making of the hair dye you only need to
use number 1 and number 2 as you can see
they have labeled them for you and all
you want to do is mix them together so
we'll pop this open and pour this inside
once you pop the lid on that guy it's
going to want you to mix the liquid so
we will just flip it make sure that's on
there tight flip it upside down five
times top let's go I to billion percent
recommend putting a towel over your
shoulders so you don't get too dirty
when you're doing it then just throw on
the rubber gloves but I am I look like a
murderer rare well party my totally know
made up face um I'm about to get in the
shower so bear with me alright so now
that you have your product all ready
literally all you have to do is put it
in your hair protip when you're doing
this you don't push the nozzle you
squeeze it so then the product will come
out like Boop as you can see I'm just
squeezing the bottle and it's coming out
so that is how you're going to want to
get the product out of the body there's
no real method to the madness here and
once you get it out just put it right
directly onto your head wherever you
want
I usually part mine and then just kind
of Pat it on in
only thing you want to worry about here
is be careful not to get it on your skin
because it will stain however you can
obviously wash it off in like two
seconds but just to avoid the hassle
just you know be careful
there we go now that your whole head is
covered in the dye as you can see I've
used the entirety of the container you
don't really need to use the whole thing
but I like to just tell it your whole
head is totally saturated you can see my
hair is 100% covered in the dye
so now we will wait twenty minutes and
then rinse it out all right there we go
all rinsed out now it is just time to
blow-dry it and style all right as you
guys can see I have now finished
blow-drying and straightening my hair um
you know what let me actually step into
the Sun here so you can better see the
color um the finished product anyway
there we go alright so as you can see it
is basically on the perfect shade of
brown black Kardashian esque color like
I said this is the color luminous
natural black there is one shade darker
than this which is called jet black and
then there's one shade lighter than this
which is deep brown black I've used deep
brown black before but it has more of a
reddish tone and I wanted to go with a
bit of a cooler undertone this time more
Blues in the dye if you know anything
about hair um so that is why I went with
this one but I would definitely
recommend so I'm gonna throw in my
extensions and finish off the look
alright so there you go as you can see I
have now glowed up my face a little bit
and putting an extension in it so it
looks fabulous totally matches perfectly
I actually dye my extensions with the
same hair dye that I just dyed my hair
with super easy literally just do the
same thing if you want to see the video
about my extensions you can click back
here and the link will teach you all
about it um but anyways yeah so I would
definitely recommend like I said this is
the perfect shade of Kardashian black um
I hope you guys enjoyed if you have any
other questions comments concerns hit me

course all my social media is at Amber's

DMS I'll always respond uh because I
love to talk
can you tell um alright I guess that's
it until next time you guys

it

hair it looks great
