the City uh Who am I kidding this is not
like Sex in the City at all it's just a
lot of City and I guess there's a lot of
shoes but anyways welcome back to what
this video is actually about so today
I'm gonna help you guys channel your
inner Carrie Bradshaw and fashionista
because I'm always talking about my
clothes and I'm always talking about how
much I love fashion but I'm never really
telling you how to find your own
personal style so today I thought it
would be fun to share with you guys my
little tips and tricks to finding your
own inner fashion goddess so here we go
how to find your inner fashionista or I
guess fashionista any guys out there hi
guys um so here we go how to find your
personal style featuring a bunch of very
extra clothing
all righty the tip number one is to find
yourself two style icons one which is
more of an aspirational look you guys
know I love Kim Kardashian so I just
think she has like the coolest wardrobe
ever and is definitely goals well this
is an everyday look it's definitely
something that I can pull from and use
as inspiration in my own everyday
wardrobe and the second person that
you're gonna want to use is someone who
has kind of a similar look to you I love
Carli bybel you guys totally know her
because she's like the most coolest
youtuber ever but um we didn't her don't
really look like but she does have dark
hair and loves to wear dark makeup and
we're both petite so I always look to
her because I know that whatever she's
wearing is probably gonna look kind of
similar on me so if I love her outfit
which 900 percent of the time I do I
will go ahead and take cues from her
because I know if she's wearing it and
looks great it'll probably look great on
me too
yes Carla for some reason you ever see
this video I freakin love you thanks for
being amazing okay continuing for
instance one of these outfits like this
great for inspiration because all it is
is really a jean jacket and some clear
boots so check it out so I just went
ahead and made it my own got a ripped
Jean jacket thrown a crystal each ocher
because I just frickin love these and
then I happen to find a complete dupe of
her boots so I freaking just love these
these are from of course Lola's um Cape
Robin is actually the brand so there you
go
dynamites buh-bye Kimmie but personal
style by you
tip number two it learned your body type
and what flatters it so I pulled out
this um really great t-shirt that I wear
actually all the time but this is
something that is a good example I'm a
little smaller but I have a bigger chest
so this doesn't really look back but on
me as you can see I just kind of look
like a box so I would usually opt for
the same dress in a slightly tighter fit
because that will just flatter my body
just a little bit more if you want to
style it a little differently that is
where you're going to be able to put
your own personal Flair on it like there
you go add some cool shoes with a new
tie up and now it looks like a totally
bangin outfit
definitely where somebody shorts under
this though cuz this is a little short
so maybe don't tied up that high but
point is you can see how the ugly
t-shirt instantly got cute mmm
thing that you might not even think
about when you're trying to find your
own style go through your closet and see
what you already have because it's
usually a good indication of things that
you like there's actually a lot of
things to look for when you're going
through your closet this is my closet by
the way you guys oh my little beautiful
renovated closet that I redid my whole
self anyways not important so things to
look for when you're going through your
closet first of all pay attention to
colors because if you have a bunch of
black things or a bunch of white things
or a bunch of pink things that's
probably an indication that you feel
good in that color so focus on it why
not who cares if you only put three or
four colors if those the colors that you
feel best in maybe that's just what your
personal style is going to be also look
for colors that are flattering to you
like my eyes look great with greyish
Brown colors because my eyes are kind of
a gray Brown um
that's only brings out my eyes so if you
have green eyes blue eyes wear colors
that compliment your face because those
are colors that are gonna make you feel
beautiful and look beautiful all at the
same time also pay attention to things
that you have multiples of like you're
going through your closet and you
realize oh I have 18 faux white fur
coats maybe that's an indication that
you really like the way you look and
feel in those so maybe that's something
that you should look for in the future
when you're shopping another good tip is
to make a list to think about what you
do during the week like if you're a
lawyer you probably don't need eight
hundred sparkling cocktail dresses but
um if you're like maybe you're a
cocktail waitress maybe you need ten
thousand sparkly cocktail dresses so
think about what you need when you go
shopping because that's gonna help your
closet develop more into a cohesive
little personal style type thing um just
you know helps with the budget and helps
with making your wardrobe stuff you can
actually wear oh my crystal chandeliers
in the way this is honestly like such a
goals problem okay anyways so number one
tip honestly is accessorizing because
that is what is going to give your
personal style that personal Flair like
signature jewelry crazy signature purses
signature rings any of these things are
fun ways to accessorize and switch up
any look and make you look fabulous and
accessorize your style just honey
alright ease when it comes to basics
accessories is where it's at you guys so
as you can see look at this this is
super boring literally nothing special
about this at all it is a black tube top
and black leggings both from forever 21
I think this whole outfit was like three
or something ridiculous so check it out
though when you style it throw in a cool
necklace look at that totally changes
the whole feel the outfit grab a cool
purse yes this is a dupe I will do it do
purse video soon I promise you I'm just
waiting for some more to come in the
mail and then throw on some cool shoes
these of course are from my beloved Lola
Shoetique but are so cute and just by
throwing on those couple of things you
automatically look like an Instagram
baddie ready to take on the town like
literally just by accessorizing it
differently this one outfit can be worn
so many different ways and that is what
style is all about being able to make
something into something that it maybe
wasn't before
damn this is great what a look ooh
Killah change the jacket changed the
shoes totally different outfit even
though it's actually the same outfit
magic of fashion if you can get some
awesome shoes literally this is where
half of my style comes from is my shoes
like honest to god if you have a cool
shoe collection basically it's just by
default you're going to be considered
stylish because this is where all of
your outfits can draw inspiration from
and instantly look amaze another tip pay
attention to trends like obviously
chokers are all the rage right now but
never be afraid to make trends your own
if you know faux fur then try getting a
pick one you know chokers are in make
your own you that way you will add your
own personal Flair something that's
already trendy which is quite possibly
the trendiest thing to do
also try matching your mood to your
outfit if you're in a bad mood or you
just feel like powerful and dark maybe
wear black and if you feel Angelica
cheerful and feel like channeling your
inner chicken maybe throw in some white
on a similar note if you find yourself
constantly drawn to something like I
love gaudy outrageous things wear gaudy
outrageous things personal style is just
that personal so if you like it wear it
who cares
call me tacky all you want I'm gonna be
sparkly and freaking fabulous like go
ahead mix and match get crazy wear a
wild pink trench coat with satin
underneath and thigh high boots who
cares
literally fashion is supposed to be fun
so wear whatever you want whatever you
think might go together even if it
doesn't go together it's
definitely going to be a look by the way
guys don't forget cheap clothes could be
amazing clothes you don't need a million
bucks to have personal style like
honestly you can look better than
everyone else with millions of dollars
as long as you know how to work it
mm-hmm
tip number whatever number we're on find
your own signature things that will make
your own personal style stand out for
instance I always always always am
wearing an anklet on my left foot um so
that's kind of like my signature thing
and same with my nails I always have
them in total claw like form um I'd like
today ooh yes look at that rare I also
have a signature color so they're always
nude and sometimes for a pop of
something fun I put red underneath the
bottom you can see the tutorial
somewhere on my channel but that is a
great way to give everything you do a
little personal touch by the way you
guys don't forget confidence is key so
when you're trying to find your personal
style literally find what makes you feel
the best because that is going to shine
through no matter what you're wearing
and you will look amazing to the outside
eye even if you don't really know what
you're doing also you guys do your hair
do your makeup do your full face
coordinate the lips with your shut
because that will most sounded like a
swear word I don't know where this
accent came from anyways so if you
coordinate your whole look then you're
going to feel even better because that
is what really creates the best kind of
looks is if you feel amazing and your
hair is done your makeup is done and
you're looking great
what you're wearing is almost irrelevant
because you're gonna look great in
anything so there you have it you guys I
