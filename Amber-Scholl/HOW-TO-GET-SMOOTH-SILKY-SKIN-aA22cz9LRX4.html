what's up today we're welcome back to my
channel um I don't know why I'm so
worried today mmm there we go that's
aggressive but high okay so today I'm
going to go ahead and show you guys my
secret to smooth skin because ever since
I uploaded my DIY refuse video I still
to this day get dozens of messages
asking how I keep my skin so smooth so
today I thought I would show you my
funny little trick because it's so easy
it cost like two dollars and I literally
learned it off tumblers so today I'm
going to show you my new up so secret
secret to smooth skin back with the
blurry again what is the deal okay
alright so I actually got this idea from
tumblr in the first place um this is
like a really big stupid post on tumblr
but a lot of somewhere and such a tumblr
nerd but yeah this was where I got the
idea in the first place so basically
what we're doing is making a little DIY
sugar scrub so here we go alright so
basically this is what you're going to
need two ingredients that's it
this is Fairtrade turbinado sugar
basically it's just like large grain
sugar and that the Trader Joe's for like
I don't know how many dollars and I'll
do some good old-fashioned coconut oil I
got this and Trader Joe's - for like
$5.99 I think so this is basically all
we're going to need photos ingredients
you're also going to need a bowl and a
spoon and that was nice and loud and
clanging well better that and a crystal
trick not kidding you don't need the
crystal tray but it sure doesn't make it
look more aesthetically so there's
literally one step to this DIY all you
got to do is take the sugar and I just
pour a little bit into the bowl there's
no like real amount just you know I
don't know however much you want to put
in there there's not too much on there
and then I will just go ahead and take
the coconut oil pour that right in again
doesn't matter how much either just you
know however much until you think that
it's good to go and then you literally
just mix it together with the spoon
stirring it around until it gets kind of
this weird little mushy consistency kind
of looking like a body scrub because I
guess technically is what we're making
so there we go that's it so once I have
the mixture all set up I will just go
ahead and plop it right onto my skin
granted I do this in the shower
clearly not like out of the shower but
I don't want to fill myself into the
tower and then I will just go ahead and
rub it into my skin like this firm bone
just like a body scrub all over you can
kind of like rub it in kind of hard
because that's like it's exfoliating and
whatever you can feel it with oil is
like all over there and this is going to
exfoliate the dead skin and then I will
go ahead and rinse this off in the
shower so we use your imagination
pretend this is a shower really quick
and then you just kind of rinse it off
in the shower dum dum dum boom so there
we go
now that it's all rinsed off I will take
my good old trusty disposable razors I
get these from CVS they're like a $2 a
pack I think for a pack of 10 so I will
use a new one every time and then I will
just go ahead and shave my um skin yes I
do shave my arms this is the same thing
that I do for my legs and my arms and my
whole lobby so now I'll just go ahead
and shave that off like that but I think
by then I'll usually dry off with a
towel but today we're going to use a
paper towel because I am giving myself a
shower in the sink oh it's already weird
but whatever and there you go and you
can't really tell but like I am telling
you guys this is the softest leg you've
ever felt in your life um and there you
have you guys that is my little secret
to keeping my skin so soft and smooth
I'm telling you this is like literally
the softest leg you've ever felt side
note this would be a lot sexier if my
room was not only a disaster but yeah
point is that is my mood soft skin
secret today honey right that is mine
not so secret anymore secret to keeping
my skin smell I hope you guys enjoyed
the video because as always I love
making it for you and if you have any
questions comments concerns all my
socials are at amber shoal so hit me up
on there I know I mentioned I'm a big
tumblr nerd but I'm going to actually go
ahead and keep my tumblr anonymous for
now just because like oh my god it's so
embarrassing I'm like such a weirdo on
there so um Mia and my for some reason
Illyrio some blurring oh there it is me
and my for some reason very blurry face
today I love you guys
when you guys so very much I'll see you
super soon and kisses till next time bye
