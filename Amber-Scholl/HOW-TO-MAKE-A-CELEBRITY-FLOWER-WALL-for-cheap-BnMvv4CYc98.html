my first day as a blonde what do you
think do you guys love it
do you hate it what do you think it
doesn't really matter because it's a wig
and it can come off at any time but what
is up you guys
it's amber welcome back to my channel
and welcome to Blonde Ambition mmm today
aside of being blonde we're also going
to do another DIY project today we're
going to go ahead and go downtown and
build a flower wall because well to be
honest I've just always wanted one too
and uh since they run a cool like 50
grand for the real roses I thought we'd
just go ahead and make our own you guys
know what I'm talking about you know
those big fancy flower walls the ones
the Kim has and everyone on instagram
has yeah those so today we're gonna head
downtown pick up some supplies and come
home and see if we can recreate those
beauties but for my first project in my
new home so without further ado here we
go see I was fancy glamour queen wedding
wall even though no one I know is
getting married flower wall broke bitch
style of course
all righty so this is my little patio
thing and this is the wall that I am
going to make into a flower wall just so
it doesn't look all boring so there we
go
alrighty so we're gonna head downtown to
pick up some materials but first of the
day today I'm wearing actually super
cute little mmm there we go oh I'm
actually wearing a subacute little pink
sporty set from one of my faves
Tammy zosky collection so cute um I got
some cool kicks on an oversized champion
hoodie that I got it Nordstrom Rack for
10 bucks and of course a fake designer
hat Don't Tell so there we go onward ho
week dudududu yeah alright guys this is
the store that we're going to be getting
the flowers from oh it's a flowery
Wonderland in here ok so we are looking
for white roses so oh well these would
work Wow I could just live in here look
at this
ah and this oh my god ok I think these
are the best flowers so we're gonna get
a bunch of these ooh I think these are
perfect so we're just gonna grab a whole
bunch of these and I don't you want to
be in the video what do you want to say
to you - I thought this was fun to put
the minute they were just so cute so
yeah it's gonna be a cool video oh my
god they're so cute I'm dying
well in typical me fashion it is
officially nighttime so I would say this
time to go home
all righty now we're gonna pick up some
styrofoam so here we go ooh ooh ooh I
feel like such a dad in here okay anyway
he's so many foams but uh how am I gonna
get this home hmm
story time yep this ended up being such
a bitch to get home after it
unsuccessfully fit in two different
tubers two random dudes in the parking
lot with a truck offered to drive it
home for me so was that really safe no
but shout out to them thank you alrighty
so now that we're home from our
festivities are you guys ready to see
all the goodies we got to make this
project mmm great alrighty so what we
got is these beautiful roses these are
the ones I eventually picked I got a
whole giant box them so that's just
gonna be ridiculous
then of course we got some scissors to
do some trimming and then less that not
least the board literally huge but uh he
is going to fit perfectly up along that
wall like you can see that's just gonna
rest up there super nice too so now
we're going to go ahead and get stopped
it whoo I don't know why I'm doing that
alright here we go so this project is
actually super easy all you're gonna
want to do is take the roses and then
you can see we're going to go ahead and
trim them with this scissors to make
them a nice little length maybe one to
two inches then all you want to do is
push them right into the styrofoam like
this Boop
perfect you see it's in there like
that's just Pat it in what sound a
billion to go so go ahead just do them
one by one yes this takes a long time I
would definitely recommend getting a
friend to help you because well you know
Harry the cutout just wasn't that
helpful have fun dance around like I
said it takes forever so you might as
well enjoy it one by one
until they're all placed in the only
other tip that I have is instead of
placing them right next to each other
when you do it you want to kind of put
them in between each other so it gives
it more dimension like you can see kind
of alternating if that makes any sense I
don't know if it really did but you'll
kind of see what I'm talking about
though there really are no rules here
you can design it however you'd like and
slowly but surely it will start to get
completed and your house will also end
up starting to look like this thank God
I live alone now my roommates what it
killed me for
so you can see the roses all up there
and now for the bottom half we are going
to go ahead and put the leaves on it so
we're just gonna go ahead take little
push pins you can see these right here
the little ones with the pearly white
tops and you can see the leaves so if
you rip off the flowers have little
holes in the bottom so you can just
stick the pushpin right through them and
plop them just like flowers right on to
the board
whoo all righty 7,000 years later you
can see it is all done it's literally
the next day and see by the sunlight but
it is all done so kind of weird on the
floor now the last thing that we're
going to do is we're gonna want to be
able to hang it so like I said we're
gonna be putting it on that wall outside
over there so what we're going to want
to use is these hooks that I got from
Michaels and some wire that I'm just
going to wrap around to attach to the
board so like this so you can see this
and you can see this wire is really
bendy so what we're gonna do is go ahead
and slip it through this little area
right there like this and then we're
just gonna bend this so it can hook into
the board kind of like totally mess this
up but you know basic ideas there so
what we're gonna do with this it's flip
the flower board over and then go ahead
and take this and hook it in pushing the
wires in a little messed up but tada
there we go you can see that's just kind
of attached to that now and I'm gonna do
three of them so one here one in the
middle and then one at the bottom all
righty so you can see I have one two
three in there they're a little not done
super professionally but whatever one is
what I do professionals so now we're
going to go ahead and Ryan hang this
popper up all right there we go look in
pretty good now I'm just gonna go ahead
and as a final touch actually have one
more cool thing to add I grabbed these
downtown they were like twenty bucks
each so stinking cool so we're gonna go
ahead and see if those will work
underneath them alrighty guys are you
ready to see it oh my goodness this just
totally transformed the wall you can see
it looks so stinking good we got the
leaves at the bottom there with the
column definitely gonna be perfect for
the Instagram photos so much better than
before
oh I love it I feel like I've unlocked
some secret level of life where I like
got to achieve being a Barbie for Dave
oh the most glamorous thing in the world
so extra I love it
by the way if you guys think this is
extra just wait till you see how I
decorate my house but there you guys

Instagram flower bowl I hope you guys
