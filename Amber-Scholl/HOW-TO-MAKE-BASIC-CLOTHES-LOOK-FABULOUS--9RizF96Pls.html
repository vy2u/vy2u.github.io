boring clothes is there no spice in your
life no zigga zagga whatever that means
well have no fear your fashion fairy
godmother is here
have you even got wings and glasses you
know to keep it professional anyways
with just a few simple expert tips you
too can take your boring wardrobe
too over-the-top fabulous sound good to
you and here we go alrighty kiddos we're
just gonna get straight to the point
I've said this in a million-in-one
videos but tip numero uno make sure your
clothes fit literally nothing looks good
if it doesn't fit right
so show off the booty and cinch that
waist girl oh if it fits good it's
guaranteed to look good
one of my personal favorite tips if you
don't like it DIY it so grab the glue
girlfriend if you don't see what you
want in the store make it yourself I
basically built my whole channel making
basic stuff fabulous shoes jackets
whatever you like throw a little bling
throw a little lace throw a little
whatever you want and your basics won't
be basics for long after all there's
nothing a good old sparkle can't fix
next protip accessorize add necklaces
earrings whatever BAM you looking like a
million bucks girlfriend totally works
for guys to throw in a hat woo approve
accessories are the key to dressing
outfits up dressing outfits down ah
they're just the best I love accessories
heck while you're at it throw in some
wings no just kidding I think I'm the
only one who looks good in wings but
mm-hmm anyways Coco Chanel once said
before a woman leaves the house she
should remove one accessory no more is
more wear them all after all diamonds go
with everything are you guys writing me
down right be down or someone make that
quote into an embroidered pillow for me
next tip and one of my personal
favorites shoes a girl's best friend
look at that baby huh technically I
think that's sayings for dogs but for
today whatever well use it as a metaphor
just like dogs the more the merrier love
them care for them treasure them and
they will add great value to your life
you can even take the boardwalks no just
kidding that's super weird don't do that
an exciting shoe add style to any outfit
like look at this boring t-shirt add
these shoes boom fashion slay girl slay
tip number whatever we're on remember
basics may be basics but that doesn't
mean they have to be basic you know know
you don't know all right let me explain
like instead of just going with boring
old blue jeans try jeans with pearls and
crystals yeah I made these too
or how about these cool jeans with rips
in the but as Tyra says ho but make it
fashion or you know maybe just don't
show your mom no JK that's bad advice
listen your parents kids they know best
instead of a basic sweatshirt try a
corset sweatshirt plain sneakers why not
glittery sneakers instead of normal
neutral colored boots try hot pink ones
it's the added fun to every basic item
that gives you your personal style and
don't forget makeup is magic girlfriend
Oh beautiful so pop on those crazy long
lashes throw on some green liner
whatever life is short you got this with
your liner on fleek your hair on fleek
and your personal glam squad all glammed
up boom even in your sweats you look
glam 8 another great tip pair your basic
things with exciting things okay okay so
this is a bit of a cop-out tip but
seriously put that basic outfit with a
fancy piece and boom you're killing it
you'll be ready for New York Fashion
Week in no time or Trader Joe's Fashion
Week which is every day if you want it
to be another great tip copies celebrity
looks believe it or not celebrities
aren't always on the red carpet so check
out their casual wear looks you'd be
amazed at what fabulous basic looks they
put together so find the dupes and copy
it as I always say if it's good enough
for Kim it's good enough for me another
quick way to dress up any basic
luxurious fabrics luxurious fabrics are
a quick way to look fab in anything so
why not apply it to basics too instead
of regular sweatpants try satin
sweatpants instead of a regular hoodie
how about a velour hoodie the fancier
fabrics is a very subtle way to glam up
any look
and last but certainly not least the
most important tip of all confidence is
key so strut your stuff it's not an
outfit that makes you it's you that
makes the outfit so rock on princess
even if you look a little crazy
sometimes you will it's just unavoidable
if you work it the fabulosity will
always follow so there you have it kids
those are all my best tips so go out
there get glam have the time of your
life like I said basic clothes don't
have to be basic and neither do you
as always if you have any future
