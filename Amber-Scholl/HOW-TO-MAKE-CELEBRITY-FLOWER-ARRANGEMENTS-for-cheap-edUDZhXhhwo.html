dogs and cats to a bunch of you guys say
your dogs and cats watch your videos
with me that makes my heart so so hi
puppies hi kitties anyways to the video
up you guys in amber welcome back to my
channel
and today we're gonna go ahead and do
something settings Eddy flowery so today
with all the new Kardashian babies in
the world lately I thought it would be
fun to go ahead and copy some of their
infamous flower arrangements that
they've been getting for the birth of
their babies because they're hella hella
hella expensive and pretty easy to make
if you do it yourself so today I'm gonna
show you how to do just that
so we're gonna head downtown pick up
some materials and come back and see
what kind of crafty goodies I can come
up with so without further ado there we
go the last celebrity flower
arrangements infamous broke wedge style
of course
all righty before we get going here
their outfit of the day which actually
looks like it doesn't match at all in
this mirror I don't know why it looks
like that does it look like that in real
life I don't know why it looks like it
doesn't match at all of this mirror but
I found a few it matches in real life
just must be the weird lighting so
wrinkly little hoodie up Amma's I'm so
cute matching green leggings from
forever 21 I have cool shoes and cool
socks on but other than that it's really
not the most exciting outfit in the
world but you know definitely not my
most exciting outfit ever but you know
let's pick up flowers downtown it's fine
so here we go on wood Oh bone wood huh
all right ease we're heading up one of
my favorite places ever most katella's
to get well I don't know exactly but
we'll see so cool they have literally
everything but what we're going to want
to get is can you see them back there
styrofoam letters so you can feed they
just have like you know giant styrofoam
letters so we're gonna buy these to say
well I don't have a baby I have
literally no idea where we're gonna make
them say but they watch my videos
anything you want to say all right here
we go
on to the next stop Thanks alrighty so
now we got to get some flowers so we're
gonna pop in to one of my favorite
flower stores this place right I don't
really think I want this kind I'm pretty
sure I want to do pink roses just like
Kylie had so let's see these are a
little too big they're gonna cover the
whole letter and not look so cool but
perfect alright even though I don't
really need any crystals
Benjamin really quick okay we're both in
our sunglasses today Benjamin I actually
not doing anything that revolves
crystals today which is sad but um can
we get them glue do you want to say
anything all righty
no we really got everything goodbye so
we just got back and for once it
actually is the same day that I went
shopping I'm still wearing the bottom
half the outfit you can see but uh I
decided I felt like wearing grey instead
so we're gonna wear grey for the
ingredients part of this video so here
we go
what you need to create this project
alrighty so here is our assortment of
goodies um you can see we've got the
styrofoam letters I decided to make them
say xoxo because that's what I saved my
outros of my videos and it just made
more sense than making something that
said store me so we also got a long
styrofoam block I'll show you what I'm
gonna do with that in a second wouldn't
be my DIY without some trusty a six
thousand glues we got quite a bunch of
them and of course whoo
flower edition I just got a bunch of
them because they were cheap and I like
them and I kind of just wanted to have
some left over so we're gonna go ahead
and uh get to decorating okay here you
can see Kylie's little stormy flower
arrangement which is just so cute I'm so
excited to do this so we're gonna go
ahead and make our own uh well kind of
like a DIY I already did if you remember
my DIY flower wall where I stuck the
giant roses and into a giant piece of
styrofoam to make a full-on wall
basically today we're just gonna go
ahead and do the mini version so first
things first we're gonna take out the
little flowers you can see they're kind
of attached to little wires so we're
gonna go ahead trim off the edges with
some scissors boop de doop perfecto so I
thought it'd be a good idea instead of
individually putting them in one by one
like I did the flower wall we're just
gonna go ahead since they come in little
packs already and take these six
thousand glue and just glue them on but
a bing bada boom throw on the glue and
put it right onto the styrofoam letter
then we're gonna go ahead and just do
the whole thing same way
until it's completely covered in roses
what you would've thought worked
perfectly until I realized apparently
6000 glue melts styrofoam like you can
see it's literally melting right through
it
oops who knew by 4 styrofoam but since I
don't have any and I need to finish this
video tonight I realized I was going to
have to individually put them in one by
one oh my god so back to square one
we're gonna go ahead and take all the
flowers and individually trim them
leaving just a little bit of wire so we
can pop them right on into the styrofoam
and then one by one just go ahead and
poke them right in it's not hard it just
takes literally forever I felt like I
was doing this all day long and all
night long as you can see yep literally
look at that it's night so now that we
finished one we're gonna go ahead and do
the O's which I actually change my mind
and I think it'd be more fun to have
heart shaped O's so we're gonna go ahead
and use the styrofoam parts so just take
a little blade cutter eyeball it because
you know whatever and cut out a little
heart so it has a little opening so it
looks kind of like an L great and then
of course back to square one one by one
we're going to go ahead and poke in all
the little roses one by one by one until
you go crazy to make it look cleaner
make sure you go ahead and line the
inside too and of course the outside
just so it gives it that more finished
look by the way you're gonna make a
giant mess when you're doing this like a
giant mess at least the mess is
aesthetically pleasing this time and
somewhat contained it's only over here
which is still a big mess but it looks
so beautiful okay now we're gonna go
ahead and do the base so basically what
we're gonna do is the same thing we're
gonna go ahead and empty out the little
white roses container and you can see
they're the same exact things so it's
like 2:00 in the morning I absolutely
cannot be bothered to stick them in one
by one so we bout the styrofoam it's
okay we're just gonna put them out here
anyway so II 6-thousand glue and glue
them on I guess this is a different kind
of styrofoam so it didn't melt as much
so shout out to the styrofoam thanks for
smiling on this project God okay so you
see we're just gonna go ahead glue those
on do the top two until voila
the base is completed we're gonna go
ahead and let those dry overnight
because like I said it is nighttime and
I am pooped tired so we're gonna go to
bed
but we're still waking up right nearly
because I like to watch a sunrise it's
almost like the world is saying hello to
you it's so cute so back to the project
here we go you can we're gonna go ahead
and just mount the letters onto the base
I'm sure there's a better way to do this
but for now since my letters are so
small in light this works just fine
we're gonna go ahead and take these
little safety pin things and we're just
gonna go ahead and stick them through
the bottom so half of them is sticking
out and that way we can just go ahead
and stick the needles right on into the
base so they stand up straight I'm gonna
leave mine up against the ball anyway so
it really doesn't matter but there we go
all righty are you guys ready to see the
finish oh good you can see the beautiful
pink roses on the white base ah even
better than Kylie's in my opinion as
some more roses to the side if you want
I actually made these too I've had them
forever it's all I did was buy a
Styrofoam ball cut it in half and then
go ahead and pin little or turna tea
roses just like the same ones I used in
my bathroom video and went ahead and
stuck them right into the Styrofoam ball
until they created like a little dome
thing fabulous so there you have it my
completed DIY celebrity flower
arrangement this almost looks like it
