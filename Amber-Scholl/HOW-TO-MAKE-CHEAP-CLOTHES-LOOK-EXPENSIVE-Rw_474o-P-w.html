that's I don't even think supposed to be
plural anyways welcome back to my
channel and if you're new hello and
welcome to my channel
anyways so today I'm going to answering
one of my most common questions watch
comments on Instagram which always makes
me die of laughter which is amber you're
always complaining about being broke so
how come it looks like you have
thousands of dollars to spend on your
wardrobe and the answer is guys I don't
I'm literally sitting around making
do-it-yourself videos on YouTube so I
definitely do not have a lot of money a
much less thousands of always just
signed on clothes but I do have
thousands of hours to figure out how to
make cheap clothes look really expensive
so I'm going to show you some quick easy
tips to make all of your really
inexpensive wardrobe look very luxurious
and pricy and fabulous so here we go
quick tips to make your broco into a
rich bitch
all right you guys here we go home you
might recognize some of these outfits
from my instagrams or maybe not because
they look super basic just sitting here
but that's exactly what we're gonna talk
about basics so basics are the easiest
way to make anything look fabulous
so get some neutral colors those are my
personal faves um this is literally from
forever 21
all of these outfits are from forever 21
and they're like ten dollars or under so
get some things that fit cute and are
basic and neutral colors because that
makes them easy to dress up and look
fabulous so we'll start with this one in
the middle and here we go alright so
we'll start with this outfit because I
wear this literally all the time um one
dollar two dollars forever 21 and the
number one tip for things like this is
if it fits good it's gonna look good so
when you're buying basics just make sure
they're neutral color or any color that
you like a lot and something that fits
well because if it fits good it's gonna
look awesome so here we go
let's dress this baby up tip number one
for dressing up basic things add
something that adds texture and luxury
these are all again cheap in their own
right but look super luxurious like
adding a great fabric like satin which
is my current favorite or an awesome pop
of color with something that looks
luxurious like this jacket looks like
cost a bajillion dollars but in reality
it was not I think it was like 50 but
anyways or faux fur also is a great way
to add flair to an outfit love culture
$29 but all of these things will add
extra spice to anything basic check it
out
tada look at that just adding a satin
coat makes this look like 20 bajillion
dollars and still a it's like magic
alright so before I put on this throw
fur thing um tip number two yo cool
shoes will make anything look awesome so
grab some of your favorite cheap shoes
all of these were under $35 and throw
them on with the cheap outfit because if
they're cool and trendy like something
unique like look at these how often have
you seen shoes like that and these
designer knockoff shoes boots also make
anything sexy and you will look like a
million bucks
for not even close to a million like BAM
literally all I did was add the fur and
add the boots and it looks like a
totally different outfit totally
luxurious but still totally cheap and
totally fab
all right here we go easiest tip of all
get some awesome jewelry forever 21 $13
that will instantly spice up any look
like literally immediately plain black
dress goes from boring to incur a table
in like 0.2 seconds throwing on a
diamond choker
so same goes with other accessories not
just jewelry wear a cool hat throw on a
cool purse I can love this purse
I just anyways um so those are easy ways
to dress up any look check this out like
literally this is the exact same outfit
I was just wearing paired with a couple
different accessories and it looks
totally different
but also the same so that's just in
general kind of like an easy bonus tip
if you want to like get more wear out of
the same outfit just wear the same thing
in a different color
so as you can see instead of the brown
vest I paired it with this black sheer
whatever the hell this is this was like
nine dollars by the way um some traded
out the brown boots for the black boots
a black choker and a hat and bam you are
ready for the races all geared up for
like I don't know how much this whole
outfit cost definitely under fifty also
fun tip if you're brave enough to do it
stealing celebrity style is a super easy
way to look luxe on a budget like Kylie
Jenner and Kim have been all about the
pairing denim with diamond and I am
totally into it granted I do live in LA
so I don't look quite as crazy as maybe
if you lived in like a podunk town out
in the Midwest but it's a fun way to
spice up any look again still rocking
the same boring white crop top you will
look a little ridiculous like who the
hell in their right mind would ever wear
this but you're also guaranteed to look
fabulous okay so this last tip is kind
of a cop-out because it's an expensive
tip get a couple of nice things get one
pair of really nice shoes that you
freaking love get one really nice purse
because no matter what you pair with
them you're gonna look like a million
bucks
check it out like you can literally wear
ripped jeans and a t-shirt and it'll
look like a million bucks if you got a
nice shirt or a nice purse and nice
shoes plus add something else luxurious
like a really nice tennis bracelet no
one will know the difference between a
real one and the real thing and it's
subtle things like that like your nice
purse and your nice shoes that will make
any outfit even ripped jeans and a
t-shirt look like a million bucks
alright ladies before I go up lol at the
mess that I made in my room now after
filming this well um I'm glad I live by
myself and not with my mom she would
literally kill me um I final and most
important tip for making any outfit look
expensive is make yourself look
expensive ladies literally do your hair
how you like do your makeup great feel
fabulous because that is the key to
looking your best is feeling your best
so that is something that I always like
to do because even if you're wearing
like a cheap-ass t-shirt you're gonna
look awesome
if you feel awesome so lift yourself up
ladies you're all goddesses and you
deserve the world and more anyways I'm
not trying to get all deep and sappy in

pricey but um on the topic of sappiness
