hmm that's right Kate I'm an outfit
repeater Lizzie McGuire reference
anybody no okay anyways the video yes
 up you guys welcome back to my
channel and if you're new well if you're
new I guess honestly you didn't even
know I was an outfit repeater so I guess
I could have kept the T silent on that
one but oh well already spilled it
unnecessary rambling a sign that this
video is actually a bonus video I was
not planning on doing this one and but
when I posted this picture on Instagram
the other day so many of you guys asked
me to tell you how I made the shorts so
I figured well I'll go ahead and show
you it's easy and fun and honestly I've
just been in a really crappy mood lately
so I figured why not one more little
craft for the weekend so without further
ado there we go see what denim max
all righty oh yes before we get going
you here's my outfit of the day which
like I said it's kind of a repeat from
my lookbook the other day but here it is
anyway
oh yes what if it's all look men's
flannel hoodie killer purse black
flannel pants some shoes and you know
that's it just kidding a killer shades
too of course but anyway we're just
gonna go buy some denim anyway so don't
really need to look too fabulous but
there you go
no you know odd word health that
actually rhymed it so well I'm impressed
alrighty we are on the very busy but
very famous Melrose Avenue we're gonna
pop into a place called denim heaven
because well that sounds like what we're
looking for doesn't it alrighty let's
see what can we try on in here so many
jeans whoo these the kinds that you can
buy pre-done but we're looking for some
more plain ones so the hunt will
continue
possibly I think these are perfect
Boop all right so much inspo all right
so we've got the good time to head out
party and I'm wearing denim new denim
that I just copped because I'm a
Shopaholic and can't seem to focus on
buying what I'm actually supposed to buy
so anyways vintage 70s Levi's so okay so
here is the jeans that we bought today I
was all righty so you can see we've just
got a bunch of vintage denim here that I
copped at the store you can also get
this at your local thrift store or you
can get them on Etsy too so there's that
so first thing we're gonna do is pick
the pair we want to DIY which is gonna
be this one so here we go
so really all we're gonna need for this
project is some scissors some tweezers
and possibly this little exacto knife
thing I'm not really sure if we're gonna
use this or not but for now we're just
gonna get to rippin up the jeans
alrighty so here we go you can see the
jeans on before they're just kind of
like baggy nothing done to them jeans
but still cute the pockets are great and
the fit is good so all we're gonna do is
snip them off so step one of the
snipping is to decide how long you want
the shorts I like mine super super short
kids if you're under 18 please don't do
this but I'm gonna go ahead and look you
can see kind of where my butt line is if
that's what you want to call it that's
where I'm gonna go ahead and cut the
jeans so go ahead take a sharpie and
Mark approximately where you think
you're gonna want to cut them longer is
always better because you can always cut
them shorter but you can't cut them
longer once you have done some damage so
make sure you always leave a little
extra room for mistakes so now all we're
gonna do is take the scissors and cut
you can see the scissors just go right
through it and but um they're cut
alright so you can see we trimmed one
leg so now we can just see where the
line is that looks pretty good
so we'll go ahead and trim the other one
to make sure you cut them even just go
ahead fold it over and you can trim
right along the same line
whoa they're done no I'm kidding but you
can see they aren't going to cut into
short materials excelente
but what we're gonna want to do now is
go ahead and cut them into the actual
length we want which is about an inch or
two shorter than this you can see based
on this pair of shorts that are already
pre-cut they're kind of cut at almost an
angle so you can see here I cut them
straight but we're gonna want to cut
them at more of an angle so it matches
your body common mistake when you're
cutting shorts but this is gonna really
help you make them fit and be flawless
okay so now we're gonna take the little
exacto knife thing and I'm gonna want to
rip some kind of like Kylie had in that
one photo this is totally optional but
this is how I'm gonna do it so I'm gonna
take the exacto knife and I'm gonna cut
a little extra slit into the jeans again
I'm big on eyeballing so just kind of
guesstimate whatever oh thank god okay
looks good so next thing we're gonna do
is we're gonna go ahead and take the
tweezers and you can just literally go
ham with this just kind of pluck at them
like you know how we all over plucked
our eyebrows in the 90s just do that
 I sound like a chicken but go ahead
and pull all of the strings out until
they kind of get that little frayed
material you can see it's kind of
happening here mind you it does take a
very long time so I'll go ahead and
speed this up for you so don't bore you
to death but eventually is gonna start
to look like this crazy little
spiderwebs mess here
perfecto now we've got one side all done
we're gonna go ahead and do the same
exact thing to the other side if you
weren't bored before we're gonna bore
you again just repeat the last three
steps go ahead cut them however you want
there's no right or wrong way to do it
you're already messing them up so the
beauty of this project is even if you're
messing it up you're doing it right my
kind of project since they're so
distressed I want to add a little bit of
distressing to the front too so it
matches so kind of up here in this
little pocket II area I'm just gonna go
ahead cut a little hole in it and then
start plucking with the tweezers yet
again like I said no right or wrong way
to do whatever he floats your boat into
it's done amazing oh boy oh boy look at
this mess Wow good thing I live alone
now because my roommates would kill me
oh my gosh you can literally see my
weave over there okay again totally
optional but I just thought this would
be fun when I realized I had so much
left over we're going to take the
leftover jean part and we're gonna kind
of cut some appliques out of it so take
the scissors and just like you were in
preschool cut like a little half semi
heart thing out of the side of it and
you'll see what
you pull it out voila
a little denim part this one's a little
messed up so I might do that again but
you can see that's also a fun way to add
heart-shaped holes into your jeans so
there's that extra bonus tip for you I'm
going to put the little hearts on the
front of my jeans by the hole so we're
gonna take trusty e6000 glue put glue
all over the hearts then you can just
press those on one by one make sure
they're good to go let that dry
overnight and then once they're dry pop
them in the dryer and when they come out
of the dryer alright guys be ready to
see the finished product ah dude here we
go they came out so cute the little
hearts on the front the back so cute oh
my goodness look at that
totally tumbler ready Mamma Mia here we
go again my my how can I resist you
this has nothing to do with the video
okay anyways back to the modeling and
then you know that is how you rip your
own denim jeans boom there are so many
other fun things you can do to denim I
