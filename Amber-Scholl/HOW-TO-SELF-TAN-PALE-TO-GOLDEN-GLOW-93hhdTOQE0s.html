amber and welcome back to my channel so
today I'm gonna finally spill the
secrets on my golden glow that I have
year-round even in the middle of the
winter time because boy if I had a
dollar for every time someone has to me
how I get my tan I would be freaking
rich so here we go all the dirty little
secrets behind my golden glow would you
guys believe me if I did this video you
don't know Elliot accent no all right I
won't do that then okay there we go well
maybe I will keep watching to find out
right so here we go the secrets behind
Maidan first of all I think I should
mention there's really no other way to
say this a side of like I am literally
the pasty as person alive I'm not only
not tan I am really really white here is
an actual photo of me that is my natural
skin tone so needless to say I have
tried everything under the Sun to get
tan like I'm not even kidding it tried
the expensive brand of tanning I've
tried the cheap brands of tanning I've
tried the drugstore kind the self-tanner
ones I used to get spray tans once a
week literally if you want a really good
chuckle you can check out some awesome
photos of me in high school when I was
orange as a carrot shout-out to my like
two friends who didn't leave my side
even when everyone else was calling me a
pumpkin but you know in their defense
they were bullying me but they were also
correct you know what can you do so what
I am finally using today
this is loving tan official deluxe
bronzing mousse you guys totally
probably know what this is because I
personally found out about it on
Instagram um all the insta hoods just
like me using this I just thought it was
worth a shot so I had to give up that
months ago and asked to try it and they
so kindly agreed to send me some and I
liked it so much I even the back and
begged them just for you to fit the
video and they agreed so she let me get
it all are the bomb calm so here we go
here's how I use it so first of all it
comes in this really pretty like sparkly
pink box anyways um not the point so I
get the deluxe bronzing mousse and ultra
dark because I like to be ultra dark
then I get this bronze shimmer cream
I'll show you how to use that in a
second and then I got a tanning mitt and
usually I would say don't get scammed by
the tanning mitts you can just use
rubber gloves but this one is actually
made of velour and material like those
juicy track suits from back in the day
and this thing like low-key changed my
tanning game forever it just makes
everything like so even and great so
here we go this is how I use it la la so
literally all that I do for you guys is
I take the mitt I take the tanning
lotion I will squirt it on there girl
like that you can see it kind of just
looks like a nice little dollop of poop
okay anyways that's the thing I don't
know why I said that uh alrighty so here
you can see my legs before granted
I'm in the Sun in LA a lot now so my
natural skin tone is much more tan than
it used to be but here we go this is
bare bare leg
tanning before and here you can see I
just rub the lotion literally all over
my body I will just sleep in it wait
overnight and when I wake up I will
rinse off the extra residue and bam that
tannest human in the world like you guys
look at this I am so stinking tan and it
doesn't look fake at all like this is
like so awkward but you can see i'm
totally bronze it up all over um golden
glowy super fabulous I just
ooh it's so even too like there's no
weird I don't even have any tan lines
which is cool that's the benefit of fake
and make you never have any tan lines so
bronze eagle OE just to top it off to to
make it look extra smooth and perfect
they also have this like bronzing
shimmer it literally just is like a
lotion and I'll just go ahead and rub
that all over my body too so it just
gives it that extra shimmery glow and
you're just like really stuntin on them
hoes again I don't know why I'm saying
all this bird vomit today maybe I need
to sleep I don't know anyways back to
the tanning video such a beautiful day
in Los Angeles I'm actually filming this
outside despite the fact that this is a
fake and bake video but I just wanted to
show you how glimmery I am and the Sun
woo like look at this tan your eyes you
would never know I didn't get it from
laying out here for hours that's the
secret of internet beauty and that's
literally it you guys

the way you guys if you use code amber
