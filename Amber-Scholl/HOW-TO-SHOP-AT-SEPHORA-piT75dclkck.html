welcome back to my channel so today you
can't tell because I actually did do my
makeup but oh my gosh I had to literally
like scrape the depths of hell to get it
out of these containers so today I would
be fun to take you guys along with me
for my little errands of the day which
is going to one of my favorite stores
ever before I have to pick up a couple
of new things because I just I'm
literally out of all of my makeup so
today I'm going to show you my little
tips and tricks to shopping in one of
the greatest stores in the world and how
to find all the best deals on all the
best stuff and how to just have an
overall fabulous time shopping for
makeup so here we go be completely
unofficial Declassified guide how to
shop at Sephora alrighty here we go the
most magical storage so I've got lots of
things to say but I guess I'll just
start with voting one of the best things
about before is it is super super
organized everything is always out
exactly how you need to be section by
section brand by brand so it's super
easy to shop it piece by piece until you
get everything you're looking for
and using way to stop in general is they
always have a little Sephora favorites
on the corner of all of their little
kiosks things so if you're looking for a
primer they will have literally all of
their best-selling primers out right
here so you can just go through cut them
all and see which one you like the best
and speaking of primers my personal
favorite is this one this is dr brandt
pores no more for refining primer it's
like in the back section
no not by the telling primers I don't
know why because this one's my favorite
but it's record I'm gonna grab one of
those ooh look you guys my life motto
okay anyways back to shopping all right
now one of the most underrated parts of
Sephora in general kofi Yui bar I feel
like nobody knows Melvin and then
mysteriously sephora's best-kept
not-so-secret secret so this is the
beauty studio and you can get literally
a free mini makeover one feature of your
face just done to prefer you by a
professional you can also get a free
mini facial but if you buy 50 dolly Bru
the products just let make an
appointment they review your entire face
for free and that is pretty damn cool
another cool tip if it looks like
something you love out of socks like
where is my brow so if you don't have it
guess what they usually do check it out
and meet secret little bend down here's
a plethora of all the things that are
stocked up here now you're really not
supposed to open these on your own
because you're not supposed to do that
but ask an employee and the secret
little bins of magic will always have
exactly what you're looking for close
that up so I don't get in trouble okay
here we go
another cool hat if they're ever out of
something that you want like either
whole ways out of my favorite eyeliners
which is Kat Von D tattoo liner in
trooper so I will just come in here and
ask the percentage my house because it
cost me nothing for them to send it to
me whether I'm ordering this whether my
morning 50 things whether I'm ordering
myself a freaking train they'll still
send it free of charge
brofist tips for the wind speaking of
favorite brands I literally love heart
because it's cruelty free and it's like
oh they just have to cool it stuff is my
favorite kind of concealer so I'm going
to pick up one of those too another
great hacks the Sephora collection this
stuff is awesome I buy it all the time
because it's basically made in the exact
same factories as all the brand-name
makeups but this is kind of like the
generic version so I buy this stuff all
the time because the most basically
actually dupes of any Sephora products
are going to be made by swords
themselves one of my personal favorite
tips is to look for beauty bloggers that
kind of look like you
thank you some carli bybel Kasese my fav
so pick someone with a similar skin tone
to you and whatever products they're
using will probably work on your face
too that's where I got my recommendation
of my face ever foundation thanks Carly
another cool app if you don't know what
color foundation you are
check it out and they're just really
cool thing that can help you it's like a
color IQ thing which is basically after
like a science experiment it's going to
find my color IQ number so here we go
guys I look pretty like this so now they
have found my exact color and then it
shows you all the products that would be
your exact color so cool why would I use
this before by the way guys check this
out it's not just for so different you
can do it for a lip colors it'll look
good on your skin oh oh and also
concealers oh my gosh this is so hot I'm
going to literally buy all of it thank
you very much by the way you guys you
really close do that when you're not
wearing foundation so you're able to
come to the store bare face definitely
the best option why my so blurry ah okay
now this is something weird that I do
because it doesn't really work I mean
it's like the lamenting things but if
there's something that I want like I
love this Urban Decay eyeshadow primer
stuff it's the bomb I've been using it
for like 100 billion years and you go to
the line at the front of the register
they have kind of mini versions of all
the most popular products for hospitals
right so I always go ahead and buy the
mini version like you can see the one on
the left here is the miniature version
granted it's also going to be half the
size but you know you can't win them all
if no because the designer makeup is
freaking beautiful but it's also
extremely expensive and way out of my
price point but the store is so big and
has so many brands you can literally get
a dupe for something you find in the
store it's the same store right here you
can see the Giorgio Armani red lips Kane
is literally in the same as the savour
one you're welcome by the way
so please are so nice and always know so
much so go ahead ask them they know
everything there is to know about
basically every product in the store
right right you heard it here first
folks this is it
best thing about Sephora and you can
literally test anything you want like
they have a whole station raised and
just like literally grab whatever and
you can try on some what's this you can
try any eyeshadow I only looking like a
little different person than I arrived
but it's trying things on in the store
that you're saying download the app and
not only alert you would say
well but you can also textbook if you're
too lazy to try them on so the really
fun they got a few kinks to work out
with the eyelash thing but you know you
get what you get oh we want to try stuff
on at home just at they will give you a
nice little sample of whatever it is
that you want they will write down
exactly what it is and then you can take
it home and try it before you buy it not
that you really need to worry about not
liking the products because of the
Sephora return policy is bomb
basically if you're not completely
satisfied with your purchase at any time
you can just return it yes guys that's
right even if you use it by the way you
guys even if you lose your receipt you
can still return it without one as long
as you have your VD insider card how do
I do that it's not going to much
honestly like there's no real reward
system inside of the point but the point
the cool because you do get free samples
and who doesn't love free free is my
middle name
amber free hope now I'm just kidding but
it's actually Brittany amber Brittany
feel like Britney Spears
anyways no okay back to the shopping
whoo there you go you guys now I spent
my literal entire life savings off in
Sephora I don't play with everything
five Sephora oh yes it is my little
filly duties for stay out on the town so
woohoo DIY shoes slam okay so here we go
no I would just be fun to show you what
I got so here's what I got and yeah I'm
gonna do this differently than this this
is weird hang on alright here we go it's
like Christmas so I got I got that
primer that I love I got oh yeah I got
the setting spray that I was talking
about there we go super
fab of the stuff I literally swear by it
only like 12 bucks - not too bad
um we got my foundation exciting oh yeah
I got that whoa I got the concealer that
I love so much woohoo I mean what else
that's a new liner and I got one more
thing oh yeah Oh since I had a guest
card I treated myself to this look at
how beautiful I'm actually gonna use
this as a decoration in my room because
it's so pretty
whoo okay so there were no that's all I
got um this ended up costing me my god I
don't even know like $200 something
horrible but I had that gift card thank
God so that

Sephora haul I hope you guys enjoyed the
video as always I love you guys so very
much thanks for watching and I hope my
little tips and tricks can help you guys
