muffins hi okay so that would long
anyways and probably guessed by my
signature oversized sweatshirt look and
keys in hand that we are going on
another shopping field trip today so
today another reminds take you to one of
my favorite places t.j.maxx because um
well no reason I just want to go so well
I'm going to show you all the best tips
to finding the best things at the best
prices
Oh having the best time and damn I got
is not an amazing Bertha moment sentence
I don't know what is anyways here we go
t.j.maxx shopping adventure with Lou
alrighty
my favorite I'm so excited I'm literally
here when it opens it's like 8:00 a.m.
so here we go let's get to shopping tip
number one let's see okay so first of
all I definitely suggest coming early
because even look at this it's crowded
and it has been open for like five
minutes so definitely come early in the
morning if you can because that way you
will have more access to all the good
stuff it's brand-new out on the floor
and also you won't be like exciting
people to get things so here we go tip
to just like I'd suggested in the
forever 21 video take the storage
section by section because they're great
this is clearly outlined like we have
the actus for section which is one of my
faves there's so many cool like yoga
things and whatnot all for super cheap I
absolutely love the intimate section I'm
not because I have anyone to be intimate
with but because they have so much cool
stuff the bathrobes like oh these are so
soft and so great and they're like $20
so good stuff let me tell you they got
great deals on pajamas amazing slippers
so fun oh my gosh I love slippers so
much I'm totally getting these hello we
are interrupting this live shopping
adventure for a brief commercial update
in order to continue bringing you
incredible shopping adventures this
video has been fully sponsored by an app
called best fiends the best fiends as a
free puzzle adventure game where you
play on your phone all you got to do is
match the little same colored objects to
defeat but evil slugs which this month
are actually really cute because it's
decorated for the holidays you nevel the
game for free connect it to facebook to
play with all your friends and me I'm on
level 35 so you got a lot of catching up
to do you guys and as someone who
doesn't really like
that much I gotta say this one is really
fun and I've been playing for hours
perhaps it has something to do with the
extremely addictive soundtrack and now
back to our regularly scheduled
programming best tip of all seriously
the home section of TJ Maxx is lit
beyond belief like I am not kidding you
this is the funnest place honest to god
I could live in here I could just like
grab the pillows and set up shop in this
thing I'll just make a bed and live and
thrive and be happily ever after they
have the best kitchen selection ever in
the world so many fun places so many
even more fun mugs lopper we're heaven
so many and it's nice brands like
Wolfgang Puck hello I don't know
anything about cooking but you know I
like to eat at his restaurants so
definitely hit up the home section you
won't you won't be disappointed
oh my god I don't even know what these
are but I need 20 of them
make sure you get a cart because no
matter how many times you tell yourself
all I came in here for was one pan
you're gonna end up walking out with
thirty bajillion thousand things so grab
a cart in the beginning save yourself
the hassle of walking around dropping
everything on the floor like I always do
another great tip ask the employer
throughout because they're so nice and
so friendly
look at this we're best friend now so um
am I allowed to move into the home
section if I you can't you got anything
no a litigated spaces yes perfect see so
nice will even let you move in if you
want
what a great budgeting tip live at home
good for great they also have an awesome
selection of things that are usually
really expensive other places like these
mirrored boxes so fun you can always
check on the prices to like look at this
care at $20 and they're selling it for
twelve so instant discounts like almost
50% off we're just pretty bangin so many
beautiful things I
again just wow great things to
accessorize your home make it looks
glittery and sparkly and fabulous Wow I
love this so much okay focus focus focus
focus things you need we have a lot of
really cheap art like the stuff is so
inexpensive and they also have great
mirrors here by the way this is where I
get half the mirrors from my apartment
like look at these twelve dollars and
these are so cute make a great little
like decor for your bedroom or whatever
so definitely check out the artwork it's
cheap and definitely adds just that I
could tow your home honestly my chokers
like actually two tights like choking me
alright anyways what else do we need in
here ah these are so cute yes
1,000% going to use these and I meant
I'm gonna build like a DIY crafts
station okay yes fabulous also like the
bling in here is crazy I don't know if a
bunch of people just don't buy bling and
that's why it always ends up here but
whoo-wee I live for this like this is a
towel rack unbelievable they really
unique picture frames here too like this
is so cool like an infinity picture
frame holder thing they also really
cheap candles by the way so if you're a
candle person I'm not because I'm really
afraid of burning my house down but they
smell Oh amazing
and they're cheap cheap cheap so the
blanket section here is unbelievable
look at them all I'll never be cold
again so fluffy ahh
as you know me personally you would
usually think I love this shoe section
but in fact I hate it there is no point
in coming here really as far as I'm
actually these are cute okay so this is
like the one rare exception but still
these are 60 bucks um so no thank you
I only prefer believe it you can get
much better shoes not designer all
online but cheap cheap cheap right to
the beauty section is freaking awesome
they usually have a bunch of the brands
that they carry in Sephora for like
really expensive for cheap like they've
got bliss in here they've got all sorts
of amazing products and honestly the
lotions and the hand things they've got
in here they're all so beautiful and
make great gifts like how cute is this I
don't even know what this is but I'll
probably buy this for myself so yeah
just lots of fun things that are good
for your skin and don't cost very much
money at all especially hair care
products you guys like look this Chi
whatever texture spray this is is 30
bucks but here it's $9.99 amazing also
look for the price tags they have
multiple ones of things because
sometimes some will just randomly be
marked as less like this one's $5.99 and
this one's $4.99 even though they're
being literally the exact same thing so
then you can always just get the cheaper
one and save a dollar I know it's not
much but hey it's something like I
always buy my makeup face wipes here
because these are like 399 460 wipes and
at CVS it's like $5.99 for 20 wipes so I
always come here because these are also
like fuller brands to I don't even know
what these are but these look like
button so just had to put this in there
this was too funny okay anyways more
shopping alright just like any other
store like this the accessories section
is awesome so pop in and get some cool
jewelry like oh my God look at this
stuff they're the coolest things in here
like look at these great
Oh ice my mom getting married to myself
uh-huh widows coming in here with more
of a vague idea of what you're looking
for instead of like specifics because
who knew I needed this thing like I do
not know what the heck that is but I am
two billion percent getting it it was
made for me oh my god
oh it's gonna be really hard not to get
this I'm gonna get this okay so if you
thought I was gonna have a bunch of good
tips for shopping in the clothes section
here
I actually don't because I never bother
I'm not one for designer names of
clothes I much prefer to find cheap
stuff online at some of my other
favorite places because you can get
honestly just cuter things for cheaper
than like who needs a designer thing
when it's not even that cute anyways so
you can see some other videos on how I
like to find all my clothes online and
in stores but yeah I'm sorry guys my
advice personally I don't have any
because I know you can get some like
really cool stuff in here but my
personal advice is um shop online you
can get cheaper cuter stuff elsewhere so
just like with any store I always say to
just kind of come in look around dude
give it the once-over see what catches
your eye the most for me again that's
always something sparkly again I don't
even know what this is but I want it
tis the curse of being someone who loves
sparkly things so yeah that is what I
will do you will always find the best
stuff that way when you're just kind of
looking around and seeing what it is
that you like the best because the best
way to decorate and shop is to get a
bunch of stuff that you like because I
guarantee if you love it you will find a
place that it will work for you in your
home in your life in you everything get
inspired even if it's just by a little
mirrored glittery box thing life lessons
from TJ Maxx shopping there we go
time to go show you my loot all right
you guys here's my little haul of things
I got from TJ Maxx which apparently um
it was a lot of diamond d diamond D
mirrored things so yes I ended up
getting this frickin awesome ring
because I loved it
I got some little diamond studs because
I mean they're not real diamonds
obviously but you know I always wear
diamond stud so that's great I got the
little spinny thing in my jig or bobber
I got this for my bathroom I just
thought it was pretty I'm not really
sure what I'm gonna use it for but I
love it um I got one of the organizers
and I got this big in little mirrored
jewelry holder thing like I already put
some hot chili and I guess I got too
excited but yeah I needed something to
store my jewelry so I thought this was
really beautiful I think I might get to
like smaller silver boxes to put on the
side there anyways it also
this hella soft blankie because I don't
know I just couldn't help myself so
there we go that is what I got so I can
have you guys um I don't know why my arm
is like flailing there I'm gonna put it
down and so there you have it that is
