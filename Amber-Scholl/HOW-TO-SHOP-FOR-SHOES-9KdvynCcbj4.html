back to my channel so today we're going
to go on a little shoe shopping
adventure because I realized I needed
some new kicks because I showed my
sneaker than my snapchat the other day
and people were like why are your feet
here so disgusting um and then I was
like YouTube what you're from I have a
no idea why I've gotten new sneakers in
like five years so we're gonna head off
to the Nike store maybe do some Black
Friday post cyber monday shopping um so
we're gonna do basically just a shoe
shopping vlog today so that's gonna be
the kind of day of my life so I mean
that's a little dramatic but I do love
shoe shopping so here we go always with
my weird British Australian whatever the
hell up said this is shoe shopping
adventure alright so we're gonna start
our journey out at the Grove because
well I love the Grove it's just so
joyful
the only thing is I always wonder how
there's always so many people here like
it is literally noon on a Wednesday do
not all of you have jobs where what are
you doing I know why I'm here but still
all right guys we're at the Nike store
we got to get some new sneakers this
place is so cool by the way it's like
the biggest Nike store ever
it's humongous there's like 70 levels oh
my god we have to go up like 19 levels
of stairs but I want to show you got
something up there so we're gonna go
anyway my daily workout
Susan Harrison
I guess this is why I need to buy some
gym shoes alright so this is what I've
been looking for yes black generic basic
old kick I just liked it so much because
it matches everything all right so
here's the best sneaker hacked and I got
help you have a smaller foot I have a
seven and a half so I can't usually do
this so sometimes I can squeeze into it
this is the shoe that I'm buying it's a
hundred bucks however come to the kids
section because they usually have the
same shoe and if you get it in the
biggest size that they have oftentimes
it'll fit just check it out
this one's 100 bucks but this one is 80
bucks so these would be a $20 save from
these pretty cool for the same shoe
granted that only works if you have kind
of a smaller shoe size but if you do
it's a great hack all right so when
you're buying sneakers I always
recommend bringing two pairs of socks
two different kinds like these are my my
sick socks and these are my thin little
baby socks so that way you can see what
is going to fit like and you make sure
you get the right size so just in case
you're wearing a thicker sock or thinner
sock or I guess in this case I wanted to
try them on also with no sock so then
you can make sure that they fit with any
way you're gonna wear them so cute I
love it totes gonna get them mm-hmm
oh yes
oh dang dal-su alright it me and my new
kicks are now going to wander all of the
10 feet over to Nordstrom I don't ever
shop for shoes in there because like I
said it's worth the price a butt oh my
god is it fun so let's see what kind of
trouble we can get into real quick so
shopping in a department store can be
extremely overwhelming so I always just
say look around see what catches your
eye the most don't really look for
anything specific but for me that's
always something sports away of it will
draw me in and then I will just go with
that
this happens to be wildly out of my
price range which is why I don't shop
here in the first place but generically
when you're in a store that you wouldn't
normally be able to afford something
that's the greatest way to start out oh
my god you guys look at these oh so it's
my humble opinion that if a shoe is
still more than my rent for two months
then it's not really on sale but we're
gonna try this on anyway because could
you resist why not my god you guys this
looks so funny but look at this shoe
oh man oh man I love shoes so much lord
have mercy
on these goals someday where do people
even come up with the ideas for these
shoes oh so nice so nice
goodbye babies maybe someday my best tip
though when it comes to lusting after
designer shoes is to find the pairs that
you like and then google them because I
guarantee you there are dupes on the
internet for less than a third of the
price who knows maybe you'll even get
lucky and some really nice youtuber in
LA will make a shoe jokes video for you
all rights when shopping for boots it's
important to know what you're looking
for like there's so many different
styles and you probably wouldn't even
know the difference unless you try them
on or really know a lot about shoes so
try them on make sure you know what
you're getting before you buy them
alright so I pulled a couple shoes for
you guys just so you can see the
different styles of heels so you know
what you're asking for you go shopping
this is my personal favorite style this
is stiletto but is wildly uncomfortable
unless you really know what you're doing
so I would go for more of an everyday
shoe a chunky heel is going to be way
more comfortable and easier to stand in
for support so this is a great heel to
wear for more every day and this is
definitely more of a out on the town
kind of shoe or if you are in the
workplace or something um this is called
a kitten heel I personally hate these
but um this is actually pretty cool
because it's Badgley Mischka so of
course it is but those are some
different kinds of heels so you can know
for comfort what to look for like you
can see here these two are the exact
same height but this one is gonna be way
more difficult to walk in versus this
one because this one has a lot more
support on the back end of it top just a
little life tip you might want to know
also tip when you're shopping for shoes
make sure you wear something I mean this
is weird I wouldn't really recommend
wearing no pants in public but I'm
actually not wearing no pants I'm
wearing shorts but anyways wear
something that shows your legs so then
you can always see exactly what the
shoes are going to look like and also
wear shoes that are easy to slip on and
off you don't want to be putting on your
sneakers or anything like ten billion
times so make sure you wear something
that shows your legs and some shoes that
will be easy to keep taking on and off
as you try on
get different slew look we're just going
to use these very aesthetically pleasing
shoes for this description um so as you
can see here this shoe has a thicker
strap here and this one has a really
thin strap which means this one will be
way more comfortable to wear versus this
one because it's when your toes get all
kind of jammed up in there but this one
you have way more support with the
thicker of the strap the more support so
that's just something to keep in mind
also I forgot to mention in general
wedges are the most comfortable kind of
heel because they have a full range of
support so if you're looking for
something cozy a wedge is always your
best option another good tip you can
totally see my April tan here which is
embarrassing but nude shoes will always
make you proud this is actually really
bad lol but um so new shoes will always
make your legs look longer so pick a
nice pair of nudes there are neutrals
and will go with anything and make your
legs look like they go on for days
something important to keep in mind is
the arch you can see this one literally
look at that that is basically an arch
that goes at a 90 degree angle and will
be virtually impossible to wear I don't
know how anyone ever does but you can
see this one this one is I mean still
tall obviously but more of like a 45
degree angle so if you look at them next
to each other this one will definitely
be a lot more comfortable versus this
one which is going to be killer on the
feet as for pointed toes versus rounded
toes pointy toes tend to be slightly
less comfortable for me just because
obviously your foot is a shape like that
so I prefer if you're going for comfort
this kind of shoe however first etics I
like pointy toes better because again it
will elongate your leg also great tip
ask the employees for help they always
know everything anything else you'd like
to say to YouTube this is your big
chance saving today
cool well yay happy to help
oh my gosh look at how cute these are
you guys I never shop for shoes here but
these are awesome for 110 bucks though
so I'm going to look for a Duke for you
guys but these are so cute
so as you can see with the thicker heel
here they're much easier to walk in then
you know I mean I can do squats and leg
lifts and whatever dance around but I
can dance in anything anyways once you
did on the Tryon wear them around the
store for at least 5 minutes walk around
look crazy it doesn't matter just make
sure they're going to be comfortable for
extended periods of wear because nothing
is worse than getting a pair of shoes
and taking it home and realizing you
can't actually wear it anywhere yes that
happens to me a lot
so go ahead walk around the store make
you know make your rounds visit everyone
hello
they're actually great super cute so
yeah just go ahead make a little round
do some squats and some jumping jacks
and make sure that they'll be comfy for
a long period of time all right so
here's a good example for boots when
you're looking for boots make sure you
know again this is what is a five high
boots so this one comes up really tall
and this one would be considered a neat
high boot so you can see the difference
so if you're ever shopping online and
you're wondering like what the different
styles are going to look like this is
the difference between the two quick
hack though you wouldn't know this but
these are actually the same shoe so if
you want to get two shoes in one
switch-up style and literally all you
have to do to make a 5 high boot into a
knee-high boot if it's made of this kind
of fabric thing it's fold it over like
so and then fold it up a little like
this and then refold it like this I know
this is kind of hard to understand but
check it out and then you can just pull
it all up over like so boom and you've
just successfully made your thigh high
boots into knee-high boots Oh while you
would never know the difference
Byam boom budget bitch hacks gonna fall
over okay
and of course my favorite tip of all if
you find a pair of shoes you really like
in a fancy store check online because
once you know what you're looking for if
you can find it online check it out
these are only 39 bucks gray velvet
thigh-high and you can find a great dupe
and save some moolah moolah moolah
by the way if you ever see crazy shoes
and you're like what the heck would I
wear with them I always say buy the
shoes if you like it because they're
guaranteed to be something that you can
build an outfit around like I can't even
tell you how many outfits have been
inspired just by a shoe in and of itself
also if you find yourself torn in
between two sizes um always go a size up
because a size too small you can't do
anything about it and it's miserable
you'll just get a bunch of blisters and
it's horrible so I always say go one
size up like I'm a seven and a half so a
lot of times they will only have a seven
or an eight so I'll always give eight
because you can always kind of adjust it
with socks or whatnot um these foot
pedal things are awesome I always wear
them to make my shoes just a little more
comfortable and also it all makes a
bigger size fit just a little bit better
also took when shopping for shoes be
practical like if you know you're going
to wear these shoes to the gym and get
them all dirty
don't buy white sneakers because they
will get ruined immediately though I
mean if I had disposable income these
are adorable and I would totally buy
them but opt for darker colors because
those will last the longest and stay
clean ish for the most amount of time
someone get me out of here before I
spend away all of my life savings on
shoes oh my god these are unbelievable
goals okay let's go also if there's a
pair of shoes you really like but can't
decide whether to get them or not try
them on make sure and then leave and
come back because that way you won't
have buyer's remorse if you get them but
you'll know for sure that you want to
get them when you come back a little
later all right another great tip is if
you find a brand of shoes that you like
online or see a pair that you like
always go through on their Instagram and
look at the photos of that shoe company
because often time there will be a lot
of bloggers in there uh-huh or fabulous
oh you know youtubers um and they will
have the shoes maybe that you're looking
for and they will often have codes like
mine for Lola's XO amber that will help
you save more even more money than the
already deal you're already getting
alright guys before I go biggest rule of
thumb life is short if there's a shoe
that you really want lol guys I've been
here so long they turned on the lights
and it's getting dark but look at how
stinking beautiful it is oh I just
wanted to show you that the nighttime
version because it's just too pretty not
to a lady just asked me if I was talking
to myself and was looked really worried
for me I mean I guess kind of weird out
