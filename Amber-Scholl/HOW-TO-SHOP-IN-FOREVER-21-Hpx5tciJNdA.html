hair is a mess and I'm wearing like the
weirdest out forever but um today we're
gonna go on a little field trip I need
to pick up something from forever 21 so
I thought I would just take you with me
because forever 21 it sucks to shop in
let's just be honest but I have
developed a few tricks of the trade to
making it super Pleasant or at least
slightly more pleasant than it usually
would be um because you can find some
totally beggin looks in there when you
know what you're doing so here we go my
little guide to forever 21
field trip vlog style I don't know you
what's up with the accent book here we
go
honestly the Beverly no forever21 knows
what's up like is not the fanciest for
him forever 21 you've ever seen anyways
best tip for forever 21 shopping look at
the mannequins they're often dressed in
the trendiest nicest stuff you could
totally steal the outfit right off of
them without having to rummage around as
you can see they got these jeans so cute
it's easy and an already done up outfit
for you
okay another great tip when you're just
kind of looking around obviously it's
like overwhelming as hell especially
this one there's like three levels on
this one but look for good fabrics that
catch your eye they always have awesome
fabrics in here like their faux furs are
the bomb like this is such a trendy
color for fall also they have great fake
leather literally check this out this
looks so legit and real you would never
know that it was true and my favorite
fabric that instantly makes everything
look luxurious it's satin paired with
lace awesome awesome awesome
like look at how luxurious this looks
literally all you had to do was pair the
fancy looking jacket with this cool
little like fun fabric very passionate
like tell me that you would think that
this outfit cost $30 tell me you look
amazing babe company you might not even
realize is they actually a treverton
will break them up into sections for you
like my favorite section out of a
contemporary section this is where they
have the most like fashion looking stuff
I guess you would say um
like things that are just fun and unique
like this is so cool
oh my god I actually really freaking
love this but point is take your time
and do the whole laundry underwear
section um
and to be filming but honestly they have
great stuff especially if you're bigger
tested like me they actually have things
that'll fit like this is so cute I'm
don't know why I'm telling you what bras
anywhere I'm gonna wear but anyways this
isn't really a tip this is more of just
a demand go to the accessories section
there is literally no we're better than
forever 21 to buy accessories literally
everything is so cheap and so cute check
this these sunglasses are $7 I love to
forever21 jewelry they have great
chokers and things so the ones that I
don't make myself I get here and I mean
like look at this this is so cute the
only thing I can say is they will turn
pretty quickly but for a five dollar
necklace I mean who cares you know it's
recyclable get something new every week
you're not gonna find a better deal
definitely would recommend getting all
your accessories here it might be cheap
but it looks just as nice as the
expensive stuff also just an easy
chopping tip in general literally wear
something ugly that you don't really
like that much this oversized shirt is
super easy to try stuff on with because
check it out I'm wearing booty shorts
and I am that shameless person who will
literally try things on not in the
dressing room I'll just flip someone up
over my booty shorts and same with an
oversized t-shirt you can grow jackets
on really easily so you don't have to
wait in a really long line makes the
shopping day just a little bit easier
best tip for forever 21 shopping get
basics the basics here are what give me
life and breathe energy and health into
my wardrobe like you can get such cute
stuff ten bucks and like I said if you
saw my other video pairing it with
expensive things will make it look
really nice like these skirts are
awesome I have them in almost every
color eight bucks a little tank tops
that I wear all the time their t-shirts
are great and even these weird legging
things I have beautiful like every color
they are dead ass
three dollars and ninety cents like look
at this I wish my camera would focus
because that just made that really less
dramatic look at that three days is a
massive tip just don't go in the
clearance section just save yourself the
time you're already in forever 21 it's
already cheap but just like this is so
confusing and this is the cleanest
forever 20 of ever seen just save
yourself the hassle don't go in there
another pro tip before you go in take a
look for your fav celebs Instagram grab
some style ideas because you would be
amazed at what they have in store that
looks virtually identical to what your
faves are wearing also pro tip literally
ask the store employees they're here to
help you so every time they say can I
help you with something say yes
tell them you're looking for jean shorts
tell them you what kind of style you
have they will know exactly where to
show you in the pool mess of a place
because like that it's confusing and
then you'll we have easy access to
exactly what it is you're looking for
there we go look at all this no crazy
yeah check it out you guys none and 9/5
whoo whoo
my favorite 21 thank you also if you
guys want to know something funny so um
what I came to the mall for it was a
large shirt so what did I get
um nothing nothing not even
you
so there you go you guys I hope you
enjoyed my little forever 21 haul and it
learns a little something I literally
took me years to figure out how to
perfect shopping in there but now that I
know what I go there all the times when
my favorite stores so I'm totally gonna
take what i shopping with me more often
by the way because that was like way
better I'm always shopping alone and I
mean I guess technically I was still
alone but it felt like I wasn't alone
cuz it felt like you guys were there so
thanks for accompanying me so anyways
I'm always any questions comments
concerns
oh my socials are at amber soul and I
will see you guys next time
stay lovely and beautiful as I know you
already are its till next time guys XO
we're gonna stain on my shirt oh it's
not a same great good to know I'm not as
much of a mess of the fault</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
