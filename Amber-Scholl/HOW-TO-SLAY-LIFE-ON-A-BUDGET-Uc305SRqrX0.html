I'm amber your professor and today we're
going to be discussing budgeting I
really should have put a sign up or
something because now I'm pointing at
nothing but this was really just an
excuse to use this sparkly bed oh so
what's up guys it's ever and welcome
back to my channel so today I might not
be playing the boring professor but I am
still going to play a teacher and today
I'm going to show you all of my best
tips and tricks for living life on a
budget because if there's one thing that
I know how to do its how to be broke and
but--you so here we go the officials
master class how to play life on a
budget
Noro who know coupons are your best
friend coupon for whatever you want are
literally everywhere google it if
there's something specific you want type
it in see if there's a coupon I
guarantee you there is cheap Club can be
great clothes it's all about how you
style them I actually owe my entire
channel to how to make cute clothes look
expensive but you guys seriously
everything I said in this video five
months ago still rains true today luxe
fabrics clothes that fit well design
your dupes they're all things to make
you look bougie on a budget and an
exciting new with one of my favorite
online shops boo who comment agreed to
team up with me and sponsor this video
so here's a quick little fashion show to
show you what I'm talking about
in general designer inspired clothes on
a budget so lay the game like this
Chanel looking body suit so cute
20 bucks visit or belittle Gucci
inspired black and gold set so cheap I
look like a million bucks for 10 bucks
sparkly kylie jenner esque jeans again
$20 so lay the game and some adorable
workout attire so cute look at this
little tennis set I am ready to go to
the polo matches and whatever the heck
else I'm feeling like doing which is
probably nothing going to grocery store
but still not hard to say when you
follow the Instagram trends throw on
some sequiny shoes because sequins
always make you look fabulous and there
you have it you are slaying you can also
slay the office game on a budget my
version of professional attired some
white shorts and a pink sequined blazer
accessories like this little black and
gold clutch is a great way to slay all
the time the essence I know you guys are
going to ask everything that I was
wearing is linked in the video
description below and if you want to
grab any of it to twin with me I have a
coupon code for you so 30% off the
entire website using this little
discount code right there and finally
there's a quick little giveaway link
down in there to win a $500 summer
wardrobe courtesy of the boohoo so there
you go good luck now back to the video
buy the generic version instead of the
brand name you're getting the same
product for much lower price like when
you're in the grocery store and you're
starving to death and there's Wheaties
right there for 5 bucks but there's also
brand flakes right next to it for $2 get
those instead if you check the
ingredients you'll notice they're
actually exactly the same learn to DIY
if you see something you want we can't
afford it make it yourself if you Spy
something beautiful that you love the
figure out a way to do it yourself
there's almost always a video on YouTube
about how to do whatever it is that you
want to do for keep easy and just as
fabulous as the real thing I'm a digital
revolution shop online literally
everything you want is online much
cheaper than in stores
seriously though online shopping has
everything you ever wanted not to
mention it's more unique than the stuff
that you get in stores so you can be
your own form of fashionista like look
at this 30 bucks
are you kidding you would never find
that anywhere else not to mention when
you order stuff online it's like
Christmas when it comes so fun check out
local happy hours instead of going to
dinner at 7:00 p.m. try going at 5 you'd
be amazed you can get things for like
half off check your imaginary watch when
it hits happy hour go to dinner early
it's also a little awkward to film when
you're not actually eating anything and
no one's talking to you but okay I'm
getting all the tasty treats that I want
Oh for a very cheap price buy your
everyday random products that you need
at the dollar store they're the same and
they're only a buck the 99-cent store is
a game-changer holy oh my goodness you
can find anything you want in here you
can get batteries Cod swabs Tupperware
pens pencils gift wrap whatever it is
that you might need on an everyday basis
Oh for 99 cents find the budget saving
apps they're going to literally change
your life my two personal pages I use
all the time Gas Buddy shows you the
cheapest gas near you and RetailMeNot
which shows you coupon for stores that
you are near shadow to whoever made
those apps I owe you one
forget about department stores
check out the discount stores Ross
Marshalls t.j.maxx all your favorite
brands are sitting in the discount shops
just waiting for you to find them we all
know I love me a good discount store
seriously all the brand-name things that
you like are hiding in these stores for
half the price of what you would get
anywhere else and they'll even show you
on the tag how much you're saving like
look at this hairspray usually $20 only
$10.99 stores like this just make my
heart flutter whoo all right anyways if
you see something on sale buy it in bulk
for example these protein shakes that I
was talking about it might get ready
with me video I love them they were on
sale the other day so I literally
ordered a bajillion of them if it's
something you know you're going to order
again you might as well get them when
they're cheapest
cheers to that don't forget you were
clean you're a star just because you
don't have a million bucks does it mean
like you can't feel like look at Mike a
million bucks is easy girlfriend do your
hair do your makeup feel fabulous like
the queen that you are just like with
anything else if you're rocking million
our confidence you're going to feel like
a million bucks another great tip if
there's something you really want I used
like seriously half the stuff that I own
is used Amazon or Ebay are great places
to check for used item because they're
usually in nearly mint condition for
less than a quarter of the original
price who cares if someone's read this
book before I'm Dasha no book now for
$10 or don't buy it at all literally the
library is so cool I recently discovered
we had a library it's amazing you can
literally get books and movies all for
four rays you can walk out of here with
a million books for free so fun to keep
yourself motivated don't forget to treat
yourself every once in a while if
there's something you've been eyeing for
a long time girl save up and go get it
reprioritize your spending if you want
to Starbucks and spend five bucks on a
coffee every day but there's a pair of
earrings that you really really want
take the week off so Starbucks and eat
at home use all the money that you saved
that you would have usually been
spending on your coffee to put towards
the splurge item there's something you
still really want get an extra side job
to pick up some extra cash
what's up neighbor's dogs I don't have a
dog so I'm going to pretend this stuffed
animals are dogs try babysitting too
okay I'm going to pretend this is a
child because I don't have any kids to
be in this video on such short notice
so anyway the point is get an exercise
job but nothing like having a little
extra cash for a little extra spending
tip number whatever on you would be
amazed at how many fun things there are
to do in your city that cost literally
no money the outdoors is free you can go
anywhere I love walking grab Rodeo Drive
because it makes me feel boozy as hell
even though I'm not buying anything but
it's so fun how beautiful not to mention
you stay inspired looking at all the
diamonds Wow
Kohl's prancing around outside is free
unless of course you decide to stop for
ice cream like I did in which case your
total tab comes to three if you're lucky
enough to be a student always sign up
for student discounts from movie
theaters to restaurants to online shops
it's always worth a shot to test your
student discount for some reason mine
doesn't expire until 2018 even though I
graduated three years ago
don't tell anyone all that stuff you
have you never wear sell it to buy some
new stuff you'd be amazed at how much
people will pay for your old things like
they always say one man's trash is
another man's treasure
not to mention you'll have new cash to
buy what you want to buy could you fall
in love with the designer item and
you're just
can't afford to put the bill fine to do
nothing is worse than falling in love
with something that cost more than your
rent for a year so google it watch some
videos I guarantee you there's a dupe of
whatever it is you want online by
stealing the designer fashion you can
look just as good as the runway for 20
bucks another great tip pay attention to
storage social media stars are always
posting all the info for other sales so
if you pay attention to store social
media you'll always know where to get
the latest deals or even bloggers and
youtubers like me youtubers and bloggers
are always posting dupes to all sorts of
fun things plus they always have littlez
of discount codes that are good all year
round for just about anything you ever
wanted when it comes to doing boozy
things on a budget having friends is
your best friend doesn't make a lot of
sense but let me explain forget a limo
get picked up in a Bentley when you're
splitting with Ted people everything's
gonna be cheaper side note the fact that
I decided I wanted to film a luxury
vehicle for this part and only had to
walk two feet before I ran into a
Bentley huh that's a lie for you by the
way I do have friends you guys never
believe me when I say a friend annoys
alone but I have friends my roommate
Celina and this is her boyfriend kai
anyway point is split things with your
friends it makes everything much cheaper
goodbye you guys all right guys if
you're really pressed for cash get the
half size of things or even just use
samples I know it's not necessarily
actually economically sounds because
you're really getting less for what
you're paying for but if you really
can't afford it but you still want the
same thing I am all for buying the half
size also hello samples I haven't bought
an eyeshadow primer in months because
I've just been using this free sample
from Sephora want the boozy experience
of a spa without footing the bill
instead of paying like 300 bucks for a
massage just get a day pass you can get
them on Groupon for like 20 bucks and
budding bottle you may not be getting a
massage but you can still hang out in
the saunas you can hang out in the hot
tub it's super fun great Girl's Day you
can see on my snapchat me and my friends
literally do this all the time because
only like sixteen dollars to go in for
the day super fun and you feel just as
relaxed and cleansed as if you paid the
big bucks no matter what you're doing
always get the most bang for your buck
for example Sephora gives you a free
makeover if you buy fifty dollars or
more products so if you're going to be
doing that anyway
if the freemake overdue you might as
well get the most bang for your buck
same thing when it comes to beauty
treatments if you can do it at home do
it at home do your own nails dye your
own hair super easy and you save the
cost of all the salon treatments fake it
till you make it my friends instead of a
crystal chandelier getting acrylic
chandelier instead of real flower and
get a fake flower so I'll have the price
with the same look and that my friends
is what it means to slay on a budget
PS you guys before I sign off don't
forget the biggest and most important
tip of all work hard play harder don't
give up you're not going to be on a
budget forever someday we'll all be
