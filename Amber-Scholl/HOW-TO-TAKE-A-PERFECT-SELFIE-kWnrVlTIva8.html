back to my channel so today I thought
it'd be fun to do a totally silly video
and because I'm always getting asked
about how I took my Instagram photos so
it's a true install myself I thought
it'd be fun to blow the lid off all of
us and show you guys how we take all of
our fabulous selfies because if there's
one thing that we know how to do it's
strike a pose for the gram so today I'm
going to show you all the tips and
tricks to keeping your selfies fire and
your insta game totally poppin so here
we go the official insta masterclass how
to take a good selfie number one tip for
any selfie is finding good lighting for
instances healthy taken in your dark
closet obviously isn't gonna come out
good because no matter what you do the
lighting looks ugly but nice natural
lighting sitting in front of a window
like I am right now there's a giant
window in my room oh so much better same
pose same looks but this selfie is going
to be a 10,000 times better than the
other one another great lighting tip
direct sunlight play with the shadows
you can create all sorts of interesting
photos however I'm not gonna lie I
practically go blind every time I'm
trying to take a picture in direct
sunlight so while it does make your eyes
a beautiful color I personally don't
really love doing this so here you can
see a couple of photos that I took in
natural sunlight playing with the
shadows and all that stuff all right now
perhaps the most important tip is
learning your angles for example this is
not a flattering angle on literally
anyone think about like when you open
your iPhone and you're like Hello
don't do that always take your photos
not even from dead on know that
sometimes works usually taking selfies
from a slight angle from above is the
most flattering ways you can see here
versus there also literally nobody looks
good from this angle I mean I guess some
people do but basically nobody so if you
want to get a good picture of your face
always learn your good side from your
bad side my good side by so much is the
right side of my face it makes my nose
look like you flipped up versus the left
where yeah this is not flattering
once you know what side is your good
side you can
your face that way and take pictures
from that direction promise yes it makes
a big difference
alright so when it comes to mirror
selfies it's literally the same thing is
all about learning to take your angles
to make your body look the best way
possible check it out
alright so here for the booty has what
you can see like I you can see I can
pretty much regular size booty not big
not huge it's just kind of like regular
and chillin but I'm going to show you
how to make it welcome video Monday's
all you guys do is pop your hip out to
one direction like oh wonder I should
get in hey Harry okay now so you can see
if you pop your hip out one direction it
literally doubled the size of your ass
instantly and if you kind of just tilt
the camera down a little both you have
an Instagram bootie for days oh ring
ring hello yes amber oh that's me
on a similar note finding a good
background is super important for
example you don't want to be taking a
picture with paper towels and empty
boxes in the background because that's
going to look stupid so you want to find
a neutral background solid colors are
usually best I like white and I like
blacks because neutrals make you pop in
our designer photo okay secret time you
know all those professional photos on my
Instagram haha doctor check it out
all you got to do is get yourself a
tripod to pluck your camera right on
there go ahead and adjust it so you've
got the right angle so you're always the
friend step backwards constraint pose
where is my big modelling motion so yes
lol this is actually Sophie
so is this um so there you go secrets
out these are just photography by Amber
although you guys take on the makeup you
don't even know then the grand girls are
wearing so much makeup amir pictures is
actually unbelievable so well we mean
look a little crazy in real life let me
tell you our highlights pop it in our
pics for a reason you highlight to cut a
bitch
by the way 99.9% of my selfies are taken
on my fancy camera which is why the
quality is so good and that is also how
99.9 percent of all the other instances
on the gram are taking their pictures
but if you don't have a nice camera an
iPhone totally will do if you want to
get the highest quality picture you can
I
we recommend turning the flip camera
around and using it this way oops
because even though it's really hard to
see um it's definitely going to give you
a higher quality than using the
front-facing camera however the
front-facing camera is the best so
that's what I like to use just because
I'm lazy and like honestly not talented
enough to take photos of myself like
this it's just too hard also when I'm
taking my Instagram photos I always pre
do the settings so I will always set it
to square because that is what the
Instagram you know besides the
instagrams are so I personally like them
all to always be squares and to match
and then I prefer personally flash
photography so I will always always
always turn on the flash if I'm not in
front of natural lighting so business of
selfie I took on my phone versus limit I
took on my camera as you can see the
quality is really different but um I
don't know both you know work I just
realized side note how much marble is
this like could you die this is really
ridiculous my mom got me these for
Christmas and then it's a super cute
actually a company called velvet caviar
sent me this so I'll link to all these
marbly things in the description if you
want to get them anyways back to the
pictures so if I you ever find myself
taking pictures on my iPhone I always
use this little light thing no you can
see it's just a cool little lamp thing
for a lamp what am I talking about you
can see it's just like a cool little
kind of like a little roomy case and you
just go ahead and pop that on your phone
like this boom and then you've got
awesome lighting for your selfies so
that way if you ever find yourself in
bad lighting you can just whip this out
of your first it's kind of weird to do
at parties and whatever but Lugar's I
don't you just whip it out Sam you got a
great little selfie helper outer thing
when picking out selfie outfit check out
some crazy things like look at how cool
this is
I might not really wear this on a
regular basis but oh my gosh in a photo
this is going to look totally freakin
banger PS don't mind my dirty laundry
over there
whatever also for the record selfies
taken lying down are so cute I don't
know why but it definitely makes your
highlight be poppin especially when
you're sitting there and near the Sun
like me and it always is just a cute way
to take a picture as for other random
insta selfie posing tips always always
always put your hand near your face I
know you guys complain about me doing
this a lot in my videos but like I said
I was an integral before I was really
doober so you gotta just take another
grain of salt but putting your hands on
your chin touching your lips or using
your top finger to kind of push up your
top
whip kind of like an instant Kylie
dinner effect if that's what you're
going for so if I don't know why but
there you go you ask so I'm just here to
tell ya another random thing for some
reason covering half your face with your
hair is really popular I don't know why
but there you go I've taken many a
selfies like this and they always come
out looking great so random side tip
there's that and of course final tip
duck face you guys most of the Instagram
girls are never smiling in their
pictures I don't know why because smiley
great but even in my own Instagram I
always look like borderline depressed me
I'm always scowling but Victoria Beckham
did start a good trend because you do
look there it's really nice when you're
pouting in your pics so of course good
ole duck face is never going to go out
of style if you do it right mmm
you just kind of got to puff your lips
and raise my eyebrows a little bit
because it opens up your eyes while also
enhancing your cheekbones so Sophie
ready in no time
another great tip is to take inspiration
from your faves like oh my god the
selfie of Rihanna amazing just go ahead
and look and see what other people are
doing and you can go ahead and copy it
to create the similar look and of course
one of the biggest keys of all is
editing your pictures so you can go
ahead I have a video on that too if you
want to see that that was loud and
annoying I'm sorry but yes if you want
to know how to really really play the
game how to edit your Instagram there
you go
so Perry how you guys look at my silly
little tips to take any perfect
Instagram selfie I hope you guys enjoyed
