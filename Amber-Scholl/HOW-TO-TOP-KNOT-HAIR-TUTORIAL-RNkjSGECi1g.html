and I didn't really anticipate this I
look very bald because of this ankle but
I swear I'm not bald
cut off I just got my hair all up in a
little messy bun today so you guys asked
a lot about my hair which is so funny
because I mean you all know I am NOT
beauty guru by any stretch of the
imagination but I thought I would show
you why is my quick little way that I do
my little tumblr es messy bun because
you ask a lot about it and it's super
simple because let me tell you if I can
do it you can do it too so today I'm
just going to go ahead and continue my
unprofessional tutorial Sirian and show
you guys how I do my tumblr messy bun so
here we go we're done
no I'm kidding oh my god this looks
horrible good anyways alrighty so first
things first you're gonna want to
lionize your hair take the whole thing
down you guys know I usually wear
extensions but today I am NOT because
for this hairstyle you don't need them
sidenote yeah this is my hair with
literally no extension at all nothing
look at this I'm so proud of it oh you
might know I actually started taking
those sugar bear hair pill things like
back in January I think I started taking
it and honest to god and sponsor suicide
I really think that these are great and
I would recommend them to literally
anyone look at my hair you guys know
I've been to grow my hair forever to
like this is the only thing that I feel
like it's ever actually made a
difference so random side note thanks
sugar bear ooh baby so first things
first we're going to straighten up the
crazy mane I actually got a new
straightener by the way um tada here it
is literally it is a brush straightener
so I don't know if you can see this but
look at that it's so cool it literally
is like looks like a brush and it's
totally safe to the touch because the
tips don't get hot so you can put it
right onto your head like so and just
straighten all of the crazy fly ways
right away so I know quick story time
because I don't want to bore you guys
long just like straining my hair
remember how I said I'd met some guy who
like looked like Phil of the future and
I was like oh my god you're filled
future but then it turned out you 11
souls the future and it was like really
awkward well I was at a farm
market the other day and I saw the
wrestle of the future but then I got too
nervous and didn't say hi but I did text
the other guy and say like oh hey I
thought real Phil in future but then he
was like never fondant so okay anyways
failing love life aside I mean like
vanity planet sent this to me and this
is on the pricier side this is usually
80 bucks but I got them to agree to do a
collab but so if you want to get it it's
literally only forty dollars with code
Princess amber so I thought that was
such a nice coat of them to make up for
me to like how cute is that
so there we go sleek and shiny and ready
to go fabulous alright so I know that my
hair is totally pin straight I'm gonna
go ahead and put it and this is how I do
that mm-hmm accent time now I'm just
getting all sparrows I know I'm sorry if
it doesn't look like I'm looking at you
guys I keep looking at the viewfinder
you know I'm not really used to like
using a tripod this is very difficult
for me because I'm not a beauty guru but
I'm trying like that so um anyways what
was I even talking about hmm oh yeah
okay so so I'm just going to go ahead
and take two little sections out of my
hair from the front like you can see
like this using the little comb just so
Britney Spears I feel like ooh baby save
us one month time there we go now I got
my little pieces I am ready to throw my
hair switching my angle here for this
part to show you the top of my head I'm
literally just going to take one of
these little hair things for the bob
calm I'm obsessed with them and then you
get your what I'm showing right you can
cheat it are you just going to take the
comb and throw my hair upwards into a
wall
again hard to see this but we got two
little pony on top of my head there we
go
I'm sorry this is like the worst hair
tutorial ever but like I said I'm trying
alrighty so wonder hair is up like this
you guys might have seen my video with
my good friend Josh who is the celebrity
hairstylist but since he is away on tour
he couldn't be part of this video which
made me sad so I'm trying to just do
what he taught me on my own so if you
saw that video you know how you set the
ponytail up a little extra higher by
putting in an extra bonus hair tie so
that what we're going to do for this -
so you can see the ponytail I'm just
going to go ahead and take another
ponytail holder and just kind of strap
that on there again so like a little
double pony and it's just going to fit
it up higher and that's my friends going
to the bay use a base up off bun so now
we make the bun so for this part we're
literally just going to take the
remainder of our hair and kind of scoop
it around like this around the little
pony thing so turn off that's literally
it and then we're just going to take a
little baby rubber band we're just going
to take it one and do this at the base
loop like that I want to want it kind of
connected you can kind of mess around
with it do whatever you want to make it
look however you want it to look I
actually want mine to look exactly like
this so I would say that perfect like I
said I'm not a hair professional so I
have lunch like scraggly flyaways
whenever you get hair spray those but I
personally think it's just easier to use
Clips so I go ahead take this little
quick that your mom used to use when you
were up kid and I will just clip those
back legs so it's hard to film this but
I'm literally just clipping the fuzzies
like it's not rocket science I think you
guys can figure that out without me
showing you and once I've clicked all
the studies back I actually going to go
ahead and add some extra fuzzy just
because I'm weird and I want some extra
so I will just use the back edge of the
comb and pull out some pieces like this
you can see that little piece like that
you know you don't have to do that
obviously you can just leave it but it's
up to you so they don't stick out like
this I will go ahead and restrain toast
so some but a bump little um football
curling it under some tastic oh also
look at that glow bitch yes Oh
come on and if my fact that it's a messy
bun I still like it - like not look
super messy so I go I did hairspray
little chunks I like to spray my hand
first because I really don't know why I
do this but I just go ahead do that kind
of Pat it on the areas that I want to
stay down
uh-huh and fatah there you go this is my
version of a hair tutorial despite the
fact that I did everything wrong I think
it looks you know at least okay ish a
metaphor for my life no kidding anyways
so there you guys that is how I do my
little tumblr yes
messy bun I hope you guys enjoyed a
really weird long tutorial that didn't
make all that much sense but like I said
