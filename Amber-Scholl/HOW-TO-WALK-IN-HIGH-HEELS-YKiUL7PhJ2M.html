my channel so I don't know why I'm just
like really feeling the ponytail of
today and I'm also feeling my shoe all
but I'm always failing my shoe wall so
that's nothing out of the ordinary so
you guys know I love shoes basically the
entire internet knows this it is not a
secret literally at all even my Twitter
headers about shoes that comment made me
last for so long I need someone who
talks about me like I talk about my
shoes too but honestly who even needs a
boyfriend when you have these duties Oh
got it
you're a beautiful babe okay this is
getting a little weird so back to the
video yes you guys are always asking me
my tips for walking in heels because yes
I do actually wear all of these and yes
I do actually wear heels pretty much
every day
why not life short so today I'm going to
tell you guys my secrets and tricks and
tips to walking in high heels like a pro
so from a true shoe ho to the world
here are the best-kept secret all right
guys we're going to start out with a
little bit of shoe 101 picking your nail
is super important so here's the quick
one-minute masterclass this one's not
rocket science taller heels are way less
comfortable then shorter heels so look
at heel height it's important when it
comes to shoes size matters the thicker
the heel the easier it's going to be to
walk in versus a stiletto which is going
to be a lot more difficult to balance in
the next thing you're going to want to
look for is the arch of the heel the
closer to a 90 degree angle the shoe
arch in the more uncomfortable is going
to be major key alerts pay attention to
the shape of the shoe a rounded toe shoe
is going to be much more easy to walk in
versus a pointed toe shoe obviously
because it is the shape of your foot
nobody's foot is shaped like a triangle
even though I wish mine was because my
god these are beautiful next lesson
platform hero versus non platform heels
actually hate platform heels and I'm
borrowing my roommates don't tell her
but it was hard to explain what I'm
trying to say here but basically this
one is going to be actually a little
more stable than this one just because
the platform kind of negates the size of
the heel in a way because it raises your
toes a little bit closer to your heel
versus this one where your toes are
going to be way down here and your heel
is going to be way up here so there you
go that's a quick note on platform
versus non another good
with them the thicker the strap the
easier it's going to be to walk in for
example these are going to be much more
comfortable versus this pair because as
you can see this has a lot more support
with the thickness of the strap versus
this one which has skinny itty-bitty
little straps but a Bing but of them
these look great together a couple goals
anyways okay all right so as for
beginner high-heeled kits the best ones
that I've got are to start small up for
a shorter heel up for a chunkier heel
one of the more comfortable kind is
going to be your best bet like you
really don't want some crazy contraption
like this to be your first peel those
are my favorite pairs of heels oh my god
Wow think of yourself is kind of like a
little new baby giraffe
we've never learned to walk you kind of
have to repeat yourself all over again
that being said don't completely throw
all your training out the window you
guys you know how to walk for years go
ahead and do the same thing heel to toe
heel to toe that all you got to do and
remember small baby steps is the best
way to go when it comes to stairs only
put the ball of your feet on the stairs
boo boo boo poodle and make sure you
hold onto the railing you know just in
case yeah next tip improve your posture
you're a queen you're a goddess palm
your chin up high and chest out
shoulders back oh yes now you can play
those heels all while standing up like
the Queen you are don't forget ladies
and gents the world of your catwalk walk
like it
pretend like you're walking in an
invisible line if you're invisible
catwalk of straight lines wherever it is
you want to go one foot in front of the
other one two one two there you go you
got it girl just like anything in life
confidence is key there are so many
different kinds of heels out there and
it's important to learn which ones are
the most comfortable for which event if
you know you're going to a fancy dinner
where you're going to be sitting down
the whole time go ahead pull out the
stilettos where the super uncomfortable
heels that are purely there for the
aesthetic but if you know you're gonna
be walking around a lot or are going on
a tinder date with someone you've never
met before and are going to want to be
able to stand up even after a few
cocktails you might want to ask for
those boots made for walkin hahaha I
love a good pun the best tip of all
practice makes perfect so practice
walking around prance up and down your
hallway go outside walk in the streets
do what everyone one of my favorite
things to do is vacuum while I wear
shoes it's not only a good calf workout
but also your floor good clean and your
roommates are happy don't forget to your
princess you're a queen you a Cinderella
make sure the shoe fits nothing is worse
than a shoe that's too small even going
a size up is better than a size that's
too small so make sure you go ahead and
get a shoe that fits properly your feet
will thank you later
don't be afraid to try and wear them
around your house before a big event
like if you're going to be meeting
Prince Charming at the ball try wearing
the silver slippers before you go out
your feet will thank you I'm never going
to take off this ground okay so one of
the biggest things when it comes to
shoes is don't forget you're not only to
be walking in them but you're going to
be standing in them so make sure you
practice how to stand alright so this is
something that you ladies might know as
pretty week instead of just standing
like this or like this or however you
guys want to stand you're going to put
once like in this between at the other
one like this and the ball of the foot
like that and you can kind of rest most
of your pressure on this foot thus
giving this foot a break by putting
pressure on one foot at a time it kind
of gives your other foot a chance to
rest and then Brooke go ahead you can
switch anything you balance between the
two shoes all mice I'm going to totally
extend the wear of your shoes comfort
pick a break sit down you would deserve
a break the best way to make your heels
a little more comfortable is to sit the
more you sit now the easier it is to
walk later tip number whatever we're on
cookin and enfold are your best friend
you can literally pick these up anywhere
all you got to do is go ahead slip them
into your shoe like so but nothing but a
boom so just kind of go in your shoe
like that and then it gives you a nice
cushy gel insole versus the regular
rock-hard shoe much more comfortable and
extend your wear for hours at a time
people always ask I'm related to dr.
Scholl's so I know unfortunately I'm not
though that would be pretty cool to be
related to a shoe company oh ho ho just
imagine all the shoes that I would have
so there you have you guys those are all
my little tips and tricks to walking in
high heels I hope you guys enjoyed the
