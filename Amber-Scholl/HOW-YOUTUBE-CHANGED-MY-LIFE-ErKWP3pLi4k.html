going to work or not because I literally
never felt like this but what's up guys
never what was my ground I never have
you guys on a tripod for those of you
who've never seen my videos this is so
weird
and out of character for my channel also
I just realized you can totally tell I'm
not wearing pants on this video but what
can you do I do that in a lot of videos
anyway not the point so basically I'd be
trying to film this video for months now
I wanted to share my kind of YouTube
story and how I got to sitting here in
front of you guys today
but every time I sit down to tell it I
end up a blubbering crying mess and it
makes no sense I mean I could never
share this video so I'm going to start
something new today of and I'm going to
call it dear YouTube and - we're all
going to do is I'm going to read you
guys the letter that I wrote to you
because I think it's the only way to
accurately Express everything that I'm
feeling and tell you everything that I
want to say so
here we go dear YouTube just kidding
we're going to do this normal selfie
style because oh my god that tripod
thing was driving me nuts and I didn't
feel it personals I wanted this to be
also it said I'm going to read you the
letter how I usually do my videos
because I don't know why would I change
it for this like stay true to who you
are which is taken self even though okay
so this is my letter that I wrote to you
guys for anyone who's been watching me
and anyone who is watching this right
now and anyone who's watching this in
the future this is for you dear YouTube
hello well first of all I never thought
I'd write a letter to this many people
and second of all actually I didn't
write this part down but I wanted to
apologize my shirt is so dirty I got
tanning lotion on it earlier and I just
still wanted to wear it so forget that
that's not the point of this letter so
if you had told me a year ago that I
would be sitting here today
I never would have believed you just a
few months ago I was an unemployed
college grad sitting in my apartment
probably right here
eating crackers for breakfast lunch and
dinner sometimes because it was all I
could afford
I hostess at restaurants I worked many
late nights and weird circumstances if
you heard my read story you know what
I'm talking about there I did background
acting which yes that's why sometimes as
you're watching your favorite TV show
sometimes you see me just like chillin
in the background yeah I was actually
getting paid for that believe it or not
and I got so far as to be driving
proposed mates to make n me
which started out as kind of a side job
of desperation but morphed into my
full-time gig lonely but surely to be
honest drivers propose mates with an
inventor and a half in and of itself it
had its benefits like one time I
actually delivered food to Luke Hemmings
of 5 seconds of summer and I like
freakin loved him so that was really
cool but other times it wasn't so great
I got a jaywalking ticket from a cop on
a bicycle yes that's actually a real
thing I went to court for it literally
the other day but more importantly than
the money I was losing on dozens of
parking tickets mostly I was starting to
lose myself I had no time for the things
that I love and I didn't bedazzle
anything for almost a full year so you
can imagine how sad I must have been
feeling on a deeper note I've always
been a big dreamer I've never been one
to give up on something I wanted even if
it's just a pair of shoes because the
future to me isn't just something to be
talked about in passing it's always been
a part of my identity because I've never
really mentioned this on here before but
I was never really a popular kid I was
made fun of a lot of for all the things
I loved yes sparkles being one of them
but my parents always raised me to leave
that it doesn't matter what other people
think and so I always really identified
with the future because I know that even
though it hurt at the time but um I knew
someday it wouldn't matter I knew that
no matter what people said about me now
someday I'd be living in LA my dream
glittery life doing what I always
dreamed of doing which at the time when
I was younger my whole life dream was to
be hosting red carpets alongside Ryan
Seacrest that was like my biggest dream
in life I wanted to be the next Giuliana
Rancic and like host red carpets and
maybe host my own TV show or something
like that was always you know the dream
so uh look sorry guys so that became not
just my career goal but it became a part
of me my identity was totally wrapped up
in the someday it was so weird I'm sorry
was so a flat forward to a few years
later the someday finally arrived
I graduated from Pepperdine class of
2015 a la so I was going to say that was
only last year but actually that was two
years ago so yeah it's I'm older than I
thought
oof 23 man anyways I sit feels like
yesterday I was 12 but
sorry I get so distracted when I was
doing this so when the Sunday arrived
and when everyone had always told me was
right was that you'll never be able to
do it and you probably can't make it and
don't you know how many other girls want
that too I lost a part of my identity
mind you I started to get so desperate
and I was applying for like accounting
jobs like I was applying for everything
and nothing I submitted got even so much
as a call back I don't know if it was
like maybe two smiley faces are putting
my cover letters or what but um in
hindsight I'm glad because to be honest
I mean I don't know anything about
accounting anyway so but at the time um
it still hurt a lot and most of you guys
know me as the happy-go-lucky girl but
dazzling everything which is me but for
a lot of the time this past year that
wasn't me at all for the first time in
my life I started to feel like
everything everyone has always told me
was right I started to slip into a
depression and there were many days I
barely got out of bed because I didn't
see anything ever getting any better it
wasn't that I just couldn't feel good
now it was that I couldn't see the light
at the end of the tunnel I figured I'd
be driving for postmates forever and I
would never do anything with my life
really and on the 4th of July
I hit my rock bottom I crashed my car
driving from post me delivering us movie
and I lost basically my only job that
was even helping me get by not to
mention my insurance didn't cover the
accident as I was driving for business
and so as I was already living paycheck
to paycheck I knew not only was I going
to lose the literal nothing that I had
but I was also going to start to lose
sorry everything I didn't have so I went
home and was basically just crying on my
phone I wish this next part was a lie
you guys but it's not so I went home I
was literally on the phone with the
insurance company like basically just
bawling and looked outside my window and
I was getting a parking ticket parked in
front of my own house which I laugh
about now but at the time I mean you
know at the time I obviously don't find
that very funny so I was supposed to be
out watching the fireworks with my
friends and sipping champagne as planned
I ended up instead sitting alone in my
room and crying for basically the entire
May
I just felt so lost and really didn't
know what to do so when I finally sat up
I saw my rude board which is this right
here this was my 2016 mood board and I
had that hanging on my wall over here
which at the time I mean none of the
stuff was there it was a blank wall
without hanging on it um and I'd hung it
there for inspiration it was like my
2016 resolutions things that I wanted to
accomplish in 2016 you can kind of see
on here a little bit of the stuff like I
wanted to build a shoe rack and I want
to have a thousand dollars in my savings
account I wanted to be able to go to
that fancy grocery store that I loved so
much I wanted to redecorate my room I
wanted to start my youtube channel Hope
which is what I had on there so
basically it was just like a little
board of inspiration um what is
happening to my hair but whatever well
okay let me fix this really quick
actually all right so I hardly call this
fixed but whatever for the purposes of
this is fine so I thought up and saw
that hanging on the wall and I'm smiling
now but I wasn't smiling at all at the
time I saw the mood board and
results.that looking at it because I had
done absolutely nothing on the board I
was nowhere close to any of it either
like it wasn't just oh I didn't call to
Paris it was like I was about to get
kicked out of my house for not pay my
rent so I remember thinking these exact
words to myself looking at the failed
mood boards and thinking why would you
have ever made this and you're so stupid
for ever believing you could ever do any
of these things and I tore it off the
wall and threw it onto my closet floor
and the dreamer in means that had always
been so alive and died sadly some weird
attempt to make myself feel better I
ended up going upstairs to try and watch
a glimpse of the firework show which you
know you can barely see in LA anyway
there's so many trees and like high
buildings around you but
I went upstairs and instead of watching
the firework show for some reason I felt
compelled to get on my hands and knees
in the middle of the roof and pray I
begged God to help me find my way and
when I opened my eyes I found to myself
that I didn't know how but the next 4th
of July will be better than this so I
went to bed and woke up the next day and
literally said to myself well if no one
I'm going to hire me to do what I want
to do then I'm going to hire myself so I
made myself the host of my very own TV
show my youtube channel and I filmed and
I filmed and I found and I filmed a mind
you in leaning no one was watching I had
like one subscriber for like 20 months
but for some unknown reason I still had
a lot of blind faith in my channel and
totally but surely the blind faith
started to pay off I still have all the
funny green jobs of all the silly little
messages I sent my mom chronicling my
little mini um city milestones but it
was when I get 10,000 that I really knew
that something special was going on
dubois asked me what it was what
inspired me can make how to make tea
clothes look expensive because that was
a video that really blew up my channel
and the answer is it's all courtesy of
my friend Sean I was talking to him and
he hits an amber you know like you don't
look broke at all you're always
complaining about being broke but you
look so rich on Instagram and I was like
I mean I guess I am kind of good at that
like making my broke-ass the house look
kind of boozy so I decided to make a
video on that because I thought maybe I
could help other girls like me feel a
little better about themselves even when
they don't feel too great
um house maybe you know everything else
going on in their lives and I decided to
dedicate my channel to that and two days
I very close to that video I watched my
channel go from basically 10,000 to
25,000 to 75,000 to 100,000 people
watching my channel basically overnight
as little did I know that was only the
tip of the iceberg of my youtube journey
and it would grow to be even bigger and
wilder and more amazing and better than
anything I could have dreamed of my
wildest imagination so needless to say
I've kind of forgotten about my little
hoodie board that I had crumpled up and
thrown onto my closet floor but despite
the fact that I don't wear pants
at my videos I actually do our clothes
on a regular basis usually like to ask
or kiss or whatever so um I got enough
to go into my closet because something
where and I found my boot board all
crumpled up on the floor and pulled it
up and within basically a week of that
day I had crossed off almost everything
on my mood board and then some and my
silver play button just came in the mail
like two days ago so here's that my
hundred thousand subscribers black and I
have it hanging right next to my shoes
because that's the highest is the
highest honor of all in my book and I
just wanted to tell you guys this a
little closer up because this was my
central quote of the year of 2016 and I
didn't even reread it until recently but
it says what if it doesn't come true but
what if it does and so for me it did and
this was the year that I had one of the
worst roughest years of my life but also
one of the best years of my life so that
is kind of my story I know it's kind of
long and weird and dis jumbled and I'm
not I mean I hope that that letter made
a little bit of sense uh-huh so I just
wanted to also say I owe every piece of
success that I have to you guys I didn't
do any of this it was all you so thank
you thank you thank you from the bottom
of steps of my heart I mean it and this
is my wildest dream in a million years
come true and I can never honestly still
can't believe it I wake up in the middle
of the night past the time just like
open my laptop and I check to make sure
that it's real because it feels like
such a fantasy and I don't think I'll
ever get used to it honestly I there's
not a single day that goes by in my
whole life now that every day I wake up
and I just think this is the coolest
life in the world
thank you so much for making all of my
wildest dreams come true and also on
another side no forget my letter I don't
even remember what I wrote on that but I
get so many messages a day yes and you
guys are always saying like thanks so
much for brightening my day or how you
make me so happy like when I'm not
feeling that great or you're helping me
with the darker times in my life and I
just wanted to say uh I just want you to
know it really does bring tears to my
eyes every time because um I call you
guys you know I call you guys my angel
blood not just because I think it sounds
cute with amber like Amber's angels it
is cute but it's really not me who's
helping you guys oh um you guys who
saved me so thank you and there will
never be enough words ever no video no
nothing will ever be able to explain
what it means to you so thank you guys
from the bottom of my heart
um and also I just want to let you guys
know that no dream no matter what it is
it's crazy and even if you know it
believes in it makes up you always
always know that no matter how dark your
days may seem there's always brighter
ones ahead and never give up on your
dreams because it's never too late and
anything you want in life can and will
come true if you truly believe in it so
don't ever let life be anything less
than everything you imagined it to be so
I know I say this a lot but I truly
truly mean it more and more every time I
love you guys so much and kisses till
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
