top of the hollywood sign
how cool is this this is what my
favorite hikes in all of LA so today i'm
going to show you just how to get here
let's go
alright guys so it's super early because
we decided to do a side Ryze hike but
getting started this is where you park
all orig Drive granted it's always so
make sure you read the street signs but
you can just park anywhere along this
residential neighborhood and you should
be good alright ready let's get started
alright so let's see park you just have
to walk up the hill a little bit and
you'll see this big gate
it's a sunset ranch for stores it smells
a little bit like horses too so you'll
believe in our necks pot alright so it's
a little bit of a hike to get to the
hike you just have to walk up this
really long driveway like really long
but regardless once you get to the top
of the driveway you'll see a sign that
says sunset ranch and a little pool and
that is your key to go
all right so get your hiking shoes on
about 30 minutes to the top all right so
the coolest thing about this hike is you
have a view the whole way can be a
little anytime if you want to just take
a picture but we're going to go to the
top because
so eventually gonna come to a fork in
the road shirring left you're gonna go
all the way up to kind of like right
below the Hollywood sign and get a bunch
of really cool pictures and get up close
to it but the really fun place if you
turn right and that's where we're gonna
go so you go behind it and look out over
the city all right so since we're almost
at the top I'll give you a couple fun
facts about the side built in 1923 the
letters are made of 50 foot high white
panels and actually originally said
Hollywood land but the land was later
removed so now it's way it is today all
right guys we're literally so close you
can see the fence but let's go all the
way to the top we made it check out this
feel amazing
now time to take some instagrams
all right
hope you guys enjoy dog on the hike with
me Kevin more questions feel free to hit
me up in the comment section below or if
you just want to say hey hit me up on
any of my social media Instagram Twitter
or snapchat Facebook whatever floats
your boat
it's all at amber shoal until next time
guys XO</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
