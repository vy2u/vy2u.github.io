big star k'kaw beauty follows me on
Instagram I uh I can't be bothered
please please please no no paparazzi I'm
totally kidding but uh Wow let me tell
you I screamed at the top of my lungs
when I saw that that was true link
literally screamed my neighbors came in
checked if I was seeing guys he's like a
fifty year old man that was a very weird
conversation to have with him but anyway
what is up you guys
it's amber welcome back to my channel
and today since you guys know I'm a huge
fan of the Kardashian clan I just
thought it would be fun since so many of
you have asked me why I haven't done a
review on any of Kim's merch before and
I was thinking about it and I was like I
have no idea as saying as I bought
literally all of it I don't know so I
thought I would go ahead and take today
and go ahead and do just that so without
further ado here we go trying all of Kim
Kardashian's
products
honestly this is such a food okay anyway
the hull here we go alright so you can
see I ordered quite a bit of things but
I figured we would start out with the
makeup just because you know well that's
what everyone is gonna ask me about the
most so here we go I am wearing a
full-face of the cake aw beauty still if
you notice my makeup looks a little
different than usual there you go that's
why um so here's the box that it comes
in it's just like a little brown box but
the inside is so cute we've got the nice
shades of like some nudes oh I forgot to
put on a ring today okay there we go
much better so um you can see I already
opened to everything because I was too
excited when it arrived but these are
the cute little packages it comes in and
then this is what's in the bag we've got
the little containers of them I think I
got the ultralight beans kit so I'll
open that in a second but first we've
got the infamous contour sticks which
you know Kim even herself admitted and
have a kind of funny shape to him but
but here we go you can see them up close
to kind of like a crayon that's what
these look like I'm also watch them and
put them on my face in a second but
first the glitter is so like I said this
is the ultra light beams highlight
sparkly whatever they actually are
called hyper kicks this is so high by
the way I'm like terrified but you can
see oh it's just like a beautiful
glittery substance ah look at that Wow
and then we also got the lip gloss super
pretty this is actually the gloss I just
watched on my finger so oh there we go
you can see both super Wow so honestly
I'm not even gonna clean this up it's so
pretty but we're gonna go back inside
before I like cry of terror of being up
here so ho we're just gonna go back in
time really quick to this morning when I
filmed myself doing this look so here we
go
okay anyway so you can see we're
starting with a bear face here and then
I went ahead and put on the lightest
shade of the contour stick all over my
face because I saw Kim do that on her
snapchat blended it in with the little
blender thingy which I wasn't really
like loving that thingy but you know it
worked
tada you can see that one color blended
all over my face but since my neck was
still a lot darker than my face I went
ahead and put on my own foundation just
as a base that's Make Up For Ever HD
stick I use it every day and then I went
ahead and reapplied the stick using it
as just like a highlighting contour tool
so I used the lightest shade under my
eyes sides my nose chin blah blah blah
blah blah then I went ahead and used the
darkest piece of the contour stick which
I already used practically all of it so
I have to get it out with a little brush
but I'll just put that on the area that
I would usually contour my face oh yes
work it killing it girl that is it then
I went hadn't used my own brush because
like I said I didn't love that other
brush and I blend it in all the contour
the highlight the foundation everything
all together then I went ahead and took
the highlight stick and put it on my
nose and you can see that just makes a
huge a difference instantly look at that
who needs a nose job
it was super potent but since I love
that extra it's no glow I went ahead and
threw on my own highlighter to Anastasio
Beverly Hills just right on over it and
voila now we have our perfect face base
so as far as the contour kit goes I
don't think I would necessarily buy the
whole kit again I love the color of the
contoured stick and I love the highlight
sticks this thing I thought was kind of
unnecessary I don't really like it it
was like 48 dollars and each side of the
kit literally only has this much product
in it so runs out really quick however I
got a hand at the cam she really
listened to the consumer now that she's
selling the colors individually in
bigger quantities well I already ordered
two more this morning of the contour
color and the highlight so if you just
want to try one of the colors and get a
little bit more bang for your buck I
would recommend doing that alrighty so
now moving along to our eyes we get to
do the ultra light babes powder I'm
excited for this so like I said that's
just that literal glory powder that I
pulled out earlier so all I did was put
eyeshadow primer this is Urban Decay
eyeshadow primer on my eyelid then he
went ahead and used the powder just
dipped in a little brush and plopped it
on my I rubbed it in with my finger a
little bit to just make it extra blendy
and I yeah it just looked perfect you
can see I used the highlighter stick on
the inner corner and under my brow but
other than that that's
surely all I did Thrones a black liner
some mascara on my bottom lashes and it
is complete ooh that it's the ho look
via fire fire
as from a pigmented powder Wow I
couldn't recommend this enough I think
it is just so glittery and beautiful and
you saw how easy it was to put on I
literally like don't know how to do
makeup at all and it was just like wow
perfect many MUA whoo I'm killing it hmm
the ultralight beam kit also came with a
little lip gloss so there's that that's
the shinier lip gloss from earlier you
can see I just went ahead threw that on
my lips just like you know I mean it's
not hard to and the lip gloss was so
shiny and pretty too um I'm probably
gonna order this in all the colors as
for the Kim lip kit is that what this
was called I don't even know who but uh
we have our cream lipstick stuff and
Steve are all almost identical shades of
nudes ranging from like super moon to
more of a pink so I'll go ahead and
swatch those all for you so you can see
we've got all the lippies here and I
went ahead this is the first one it is
the nudist kind of one so tada very nice
then I went ahead and threw on the
second shade in the row which honestly
looked very very similar but was
definitely just a little bit more peachy
er and orange e'er though it barely
comes across on screen but it is I
promise
color number three looked like a mix of
between color number one and number two
still again more on the peachy err side
though so there we have that one and
last but not least we have the darkest
one kind of like a deepest pink similar
to candy cave Riley's collection stay
cheese girl oh yes love it I personally
liked the first one best so I went ahead
and threw that one back on and that is
what I am currently wearing for the look
of the day perfect for blowing kisses
I actually thought these were super
different because you can see it says
matte lipcream but I have a couple of
the other Kylie lip kits and those dry
really matte but you can see this is
actually like really soft and still kind
of shiny almost more like a cream so I
actually really like them so look at
that the first one ended up being my
favorite super nude so that's what I'm
wearing right now so tada
originally sold them individually cuz I
don't think I need like four of almost
exactly the same color
but you know glad I have them I'm very
blurry right now but ok pretty alrighty
so now we'll move on to some
fashion passion for fashion I don't know
why my voice just got like that okay sir
I don't know if this really counts as
Kim merch or not but I bought her
hubby's real season two shoes that she
sported all over Instagram this year
totally fire by the way I love them I
ordered a bunch of Kim og merch because
I just thought it would be so funny to
have some of Kim's merch and see what it
looks like so first of all it comes with
this in the box here's your new stuff so
stop crying thanks Kimmy the tissue
paper literally has butts on it alright
so what did I actually buy from the
kimochi shop i bought some socks because
they were on sale these are so funny Oh
actually Wow
I actually really like these socks these
are fun perfect for sliding across the
floor and woo alright great
I should join the Olympic team no okay
but products
I got butt pad sticky notes definitely
not because I needed them but honestly I
just thought they were kind of funny so
now I own those something else to
include in the hall um alright
oh this was the biggest thing that I
bought by crying Kim backpack I get so
many compliments on this I'm actually in
love with it it's just so funny it's
literally just like a bunch of crying
Kim's which you know how could you
resist buying that actually a pretty
solid backpack to like it's got the
pockets and it's got the big pocket
little Kim og thing there oh yes
runway looks Oh such a mood such a mood
moving along from crying Kim to savage
Kim oh what are the kimochi sweatshirts
because honestly I wear sweatshirts all
the time and I just thought it would be
fun to have one and absolutely no
universe should this be $60 but
obviously if you're kid you can charge
whatever you want because people like me
will buy it anyway business baby
business alrighty and last but not least
I saved my favorite thing for the end
here
freaking fragrance which you can't see
the title of it all because my lighting
is overexposed and I don't really know
how to film videos properly but kk w
fragrance is literally my favorite
perfume I've ever had it comes in this
nice little box and then look
the model it's like so cool it's like
supposed to be a healing crystal or
something which is like so la but so fun
if you believe in that sort of thing it
even comes with some little clear
crystals and like a little explanation
of them which is so fun very sad very
sad mind you I bought this fragrance
without ever smelling at first I had no
idea what it was gonna be honestly I
didn't really expect to like it because
I'm super super picky about perfumes but
I ran to the store when she announced
that it was available for sale at a
place near my house on Melrose and let
me tell you I was so shocked when I
smelled this I like I still AM Chuck I
can't believe it smells so stinking good
like oh my god I got the crystal
gardenia which I think was like the
original flavor or whatever but it
smells like I don't even really know how
to describe it kinda like flowers but
like not like flowers really sweet and
really feminine and I get compliments on
this almost every single time I wear it
which is every single day so yeah I
literally stopped wearing the perfume
I've been wearing since eighth grade in
exchange for this is how much I like
smell of this and trust me that's a lot
like a whole lot I'm tired
honestly same but pretty much my little
Kim review whole thing I know I know I
know I'm not a beauty guru at all but
honestly I feel like I have more
expertise in this than anyone else
because as a huge Kim fan I am exactly
her target demographic
so lover her hater Kim is a solid
businesswoman there's no denying that so
