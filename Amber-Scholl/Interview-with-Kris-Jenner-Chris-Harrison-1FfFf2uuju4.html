beautiful Kris Jenner hi Kris are you
saying are you good fantastic
so we know we're here with the fashion
how do you help out around the house you
love it oh and look at who with you
we tell the west coast I guess we can
tell the west coast down secure first
huge dead to do you think Catherine did
he really
all my god
kind of shocked I thought it was going
to be the other one wenting yeah
I think everybody did I think
everything's much and for thought for
sure what did you think of a sudden I
saw the polls online I don't know
I'm so excited though so go ahead thank
you for fighting me what
or so obviously you're a huge fan of the
batch yes oh my god do you ever see in
the future maybe Kendall or Kylie being
on The Bachelorette
just for kicks no maybe they can help
Mike produce the Bachelorette oh yeah
there you go
thank you fans at your side of the
camera awesome yeah awesome
and what are you most excited to see in
this collection you love fashion so what
do you do love fashion I'm excited to
see what chris has you know - what's he
what's he doing under his eyes excited
I'm here to support my friend Auckland I
adore him so great alright so we're here
with Chris Harrison the host of The
Bachelorette so how cool is it to be
able to say now when I ask you who are
you wearing yourself it's pretty awesome
I mean I don't know as a young boy you
dream of something like this but like
I'm a big closeout I always have been I
love dressing up I think guys don't
dress up enough and so I love it I love
suits and ties and love tuxedos I like
looking sharp and so you know
Christopher wicks who has become a good
friend of mine over the last few years
we just started throwing this around and
we thought you know what
it's just crazy enough to work and I you
know I you know seriousness I've kind of
become known for the last 10 years of
suits and ties and dressing up on the
show and so why not it seems perfect
exactly what a fantastic idea and you're
always giving dating advice
how about what's the one most important
piece of fashion advice well yeah
honestly for guys find what fits find
what works for you and then don't get it
fitted take a little extra money if you
get a good suit I mean mine will be
pretty much perfect look great for you
but get it fitted for you you know take
take a little pride you know you get a
good suit and you just pull it off and
it looks like a box on you like that
that doesn't do the trick you're not
doing yourself justice so figure it out
for your body type it same thing for a
woman - it's like you wear the wrong
thing that doesn't fit your body it
doesn't make any sense even if everyone
tells you it's cool if it doesn't fit
you and you don't feel comfortable in it
and look we all know once you go out
when you feel good in your clothes
you're invincible nothing can stop you
you just might find yourself on the red
carpet with Kristin or you might find
the man or one of your dream
you heard it from Chris Harrison himself
thanks guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
