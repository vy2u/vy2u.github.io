shits and giggles because you all know
I'm broke so here we go look at this you

he was right this is the coolest shoe in
the store Wow in fact I think this might
be the coolest shoe on this entire level
of this shoe heaven this shoe costs more
than my rent for two months goals from
day you guys dream big I've spent four
hours in the shoe department
I feel so Carrie Bradshaw right now
honestly it's a talent who spends this
long in here and by nothing I just could
literally live in here
I could live in here I could move in I
could be the happiest girl in the world
living in Harrods for the rest of my
life that's it it's official I need to
be a gazillionaire
you can see my weird outfit it was so
cold I was wearing like ear muffs and
now I just look crazy but you know
whatever
look at this Jen know where to go
oh you sure I can't see oh oh where to
go sorry I broke it oh well he's good at
it
whoa
this is so weird bag oh alright guys so
I know it's so dark I'm sorry it gets
dark so early here but um mm-hmm
I'm gonna do a little haul and show you
what I got so here is the magnificent
bathrobe that I got from Topshop I could
just scream I love it so much it was I
believe 32 pounds which in US dollars is
like 40 bucks
but it is like unbelievable the whole
coat is fluffy okay so here's the rest
so what else did I get here I mean like
a whole little weird pile well Morgan's
it is these are my favorite kind of
underwear um yeah I know TMI but
whatever they were only a pound so I got
a bunch so it's too lazy to do laundry
so cool I've got these at Primark - the
cutest little earmuffs these were only
two pounds um also oh you guys know I
love to do my own nails as you can see
but they had sometimes when I get too
lazy they had these like which looked
like pre-done stiletto nails and they
were only a pound also so I got a couple
of those just in case mine broke off
while I'm here
super cute little gloves again these
were seven bucks from Primark um look at
how cute they are a little suede leather
I'm gonna wear them tonight could go
ice-skating move I'll tell you more
about that later and so that's cool
let's see what else do I got here I got
these kicks at Primark - um how stinking
cool are these adorable they were twelve
pounds and I love them I also got this
little sweatshirt I'm gonna make it like
I'm gonna cut it and make it cropped so
it's like that nude Yeezy lookin things
so that will be fun this was six pounds
and that's pretty much what I got at
Primark um other places sorry it's such
a mess in here oh here we go so this is
what I got from River Island I got this
choker from River Island I like I said I
don't usually buy chokers but this one
was so pretty I've never seen a rose
gold one so I thought I would grab that
and I got these little what do you even
call these bedtime shorts I guess
they're like such a pretty rose gold
color from River Island - these were I
believe 16 pounds super cute and why do
I have one shoe oh yeah right I got
bucks from River Island - um let me show
you a cute little fashion hack really
quick check this out
so these are the socks I got at river
island why I can only find one I don't
know but whatever for the purpose of
this demonstration it's fine and here is
one of the shoes that I brought with me
now check out this cute little fashion
hack I learned this when I used to work
I did the whole la acting thing for like
0.2 seconds and I learned this from one
of the Wardrobe ladies if you put a
strappy shoe let's see if I can zip this
up with a sock that has some sort of
frill like this it looks like a little
bootie tah dah so I'm gonna wear this
out and about on the town and it
literally looks like a boot so it's
makeshift do-it-yourself booties this
reminds me I also got these leggings at
Primark oh my gosh what they stole the
tag on them oh God
mood okay you can't really tell but they
are like made here let me show you the
inside of them oh yeah you can see my
anklet I get a lot of questions about
this so let me just address this yes
tada we're an anklet everyday super cute
love it haven't taken it off in like
seven years alright anyways no look at
this the inside of these leggings are
straight-up made of fur so these are
like the softest leggings the entire
thing it is to die for I'm obsessed with
them and my legs were freezing so and
last but not least I got this white
fluffy coat this was literally 20 pounds
on sale at some store that was called
freak and naughty I know that sounds so
weird but it is like literally one of my
favorite things I think I've ever bought
it's like a chicken but way more
glamorous there's no full-length mirror
in this house except for this of this
closest I can get so this looks really
weird with like the soap and the dirty
show back but you can see how cute this
is oh yeah here I come Paris Fashion
