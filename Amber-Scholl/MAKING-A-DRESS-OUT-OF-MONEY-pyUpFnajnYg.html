way ever to start this video until I
checked my wallet realized only had
three dollars in cash so anyways what is
up you guys if amber welcome back to my
channel and today we're making a dress
that money I posted this picture of some
shoes on Instagram the other day which I
actually didn't buy it just tried them
on in the store Shh don't tow huh so
many of you guys suggested that I DIY
them and also since you know Nikki and
Miley have both been spotted wearing
money trot outfits I thought well I
should get one too so here we go making
a dress out of money honey
and I would say broke budget aisle but
since it's made out of money I don't
know if that really counts but you'll
see so anyways let's just get started
make it rain on myself okay
I really need to stop wearing strapless
things when I film because I always look
naked but of course I'm not naked we're
wearing this this is a black little Val
that Corsa D top I got on eBay the skirt
that I finally had altered yay guys
remember yeah that one now it's this so
much cuter sparkly purse and if you guys
are gonna die when you see my shoes ah
oh dear I got some crusty sneakers on
because yeah we're going out to buy
stuff for the money outfit but after I
also have to stop at a Construction Yard
and they said close toed shoes only so
we just want my feet for the rest of
this but I kind of thought I look like a
mobster wife a tiny teeny bit perfect
for the money video and with that well
ooh I forgot no feet we're off all
righty
so we're gonna hit up good ol Macy's to
see if they got what I need
so we really need to get him finish that
was so awkward okay so we need a base
for the dress so we're gonna hit up
Macy's first to see if they don't what
we need
tada the motherland yeah believe it or
not I think we're going to use a bra and
underwear as the base of this so hmm
let's see
no no no no definitely no hmm these are
cute but not what I'm looking for the
heck this is harder than I thought oh
this is perfect
thank you all right now that we got the
goods like so Santa Claus us we're gonna
go get my favorite thing in the world
no we're not picking up Harry Styles but
a close second my baby so we're just
gonna buy a bunch of e6000 glue because
I need lots and lots of it for this
project so we're gonna get the
all the ones they have alrighty that's
everything
time to craft OOP such a beautiful day
today by the way oh my god
Los Angeles I love ya oh I was so tired
of looking naked I put on a grey
sweatshirt so there you go that explains
the outfit differentiation and uh
anyways here's all the things we got to
complete this project this looks like
all the evidence if I was murdered but
okay so here we go what we've got here
is we ended up getting this little you
know lingerie set so scandalous
scandalous of course we got seasick
sighs glue because it wouldn't be my DIY
without it and of course the best part
oh honey honey I ordered a bunch of play
stacks on Amazon so well and honestly a
fight of the fact that it says play
money on it it looks so real Wow hello
Benny this is nice like oh if I didn't
really play in this video so let's see
what we're gonna end up with today so
how exactly are we gonna make a money
dress well first things first we're
gonna go ahead and take the white corset
which you can see is actually a bodysuit
I'm gonna go ahead and cut it into a
crop top so I'm just gonna take some
scissors and snippety-snip snip until
that has been turned into a crop top
frec demente then I'm just gonna go
ahead and take the fake dollar bill then
kind of design whatever we're gonna do
so kind of lay them out and you know see
what looks good and well this looks good
go ahead and trim them so they fit into
place no worries it's not real money
we're not committing a crime then we're
gonna take our East six thousand glue of
course and just like always we can just
literally glue that money right on go
ahead keep gluing until it's all
covering the corset for the bustier area
we're just gonna go ahead make a mess
with the glue put it all over the place
and since the bunny doesn't lay flat
we're gonna go ahead and lay those on
there and kind of a scalloped design so
they stick on there which actually ends
up looking super super cool so that ends
up being a great design idea of course
we're gonna put bed in the center too
because you know that's where he belongs
the straps we're just gonna go ahead
throw a 6-thousand glue on there and
fold the dollar bills on top so it
creates a little strappy design and boom
there we go that's the top of the corset
for the bottom I have this adorable
little skater skirt that I got on Amazon
and for this we're gonna layer the money
into
and also it lays just like the skirt
does so it'll have that little flurry
frill effect so you can see one by one
lay them all down of course glue those
down with East 6000 glue and then you
can see we're gonna go ahead and put the
dollars underneath and glue them down
too so it kind of creates a layered
effect as for the top we're gonna go
ahead and lay the dollar bills
horizontally hamburger style I believe
is what we used to call it as
two-year-olds yes again just glue those
down until they are all glued around
looking like a belt don't glue them all
the way around though make sure you
leave a hole for the buttons so you can
actually wear the skirt and but oh it's
done except for the fact that
immediately after I finish this I
decided I wanted to put head facing up
on all of them so I went ahead and redid
that with the bills facing this
direction there now it's perfect how
long did this take me you asked well
actually not that long you can see it
started out oh what a beautiful night it
was yesterday and then I actually got
tired went to bed and woke up the next
morning to finish it but eventually it's
worth it and goodness you guys ready to
see it on money dress Wow you can see
this is literally money money the
entirety of the dress is made of the
money and is so fun for the shimmying
deciding the straps actually look better
off so I went ahead and made it a
strapless kind of scalloped neckline
here
photography's very actually ended up
kind of looking with a belt which was
super fun and you can see look at all
those Betty's on there hello Benjamin
mm-hmm you can see the top ended up
coming out super cool too we got kind of
a scalloped neckline going on I'll be
first to admit it's not the most
wearable dress in the world but it's
it's tree cute maddie with the
president's daughter
oh yeah ready to go to Rodeo Drive so
right away
oh forget your wallet oh I'll pay with
this this is hilarious oh I'd say we did
a damn
job fair are you guys that is me making
a dress out of money I hope you guys
enjoyed the video because well as Carrie
Bradshaw once said I like my money right
where I can see it hanging in my by the
way I know this was a pretty rapid video
just me you know dressing up in a bunny
dress but well the point of this video
is obviously just to be silly and have
fun and spread a little love and light
into your lives for a few minutes of the
day I also figured it would be an
amazing opportunity to do a little good
in the world so I am dedicating this
video to the incredible children of st.
Jude Children's Research Hospital an
absolutely amazing organization that
helps care for and save the lives of
kids with life-threatening illnesses and
absolutely no cost to the families it's
truly amazing what they do there and I'm
honestly gonna cry thinking about it but
it's a cause that's super close to my
own heart and I hope it can be close to
you or soon too so I am kicking it off
by donating five hundred dollars to the
cause so if you guys want to join me to
help save the lives of the kids I
thought it'd be really cool if we all
band together to try to raise ten
thousand dollars for the kids of st.
Jude and every dollar goes directly to
helping the kids and running the
hospital so if you guys want to join me
on that I linked our fundraising page
below like just think about it if every
person who watched this donated even one
dollar we would raise 10k in like two
minutes
so anyways just like when I started my
channel many moons ago every million
starts with one and on that happy note
kids I am going to sign off thank you so
much again for watching thank you for
changing my life and hopefully we can
continue to change the lives of others
together into you so I'm gonna go break
my friends with this but I love you guys
beyond measure and kisses till next time
my sweet beautiful baby angels XL
I never even realized how unamused
Benjamin looks to be on the hundred
dollar bill so Ben should we buy the
shoes hmm doesn't look like he thinks
it's a good idea come on Betty we're
just trying to have fun
goodbye any show you a one fine mr.
