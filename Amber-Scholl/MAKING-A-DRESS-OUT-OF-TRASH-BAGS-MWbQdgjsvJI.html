hairstyle for the day but oh my goodness
it is so tight though it's pulling on my
eyebrows like so much I feel like I got
a facelift it's like whoa honestly
though I'm kind of into it maybe I
should get a facelift no I'm just
kidding anyways you guys it's amber
welcome back to my channel and if you're
new hello welcome to a very interesting
party those of you that know me you know
I do DIY and fashion shopping videos on
YouTube and if you don't now you know
the most adorable little nuggets ever
and a comment that I get all the time is
this so I thought it would be fun to go
ahead and try it I have literally no
idea what I'm doing I've never attempted
this project before like why would I
have it makes no sense but we're gonna
try it today for the very first time so
here we go without further ado making a
dress out of a trash bag
right always before we get going here is
our outfit of the day which today is
inspired by trash I'm kidding no it's
not but we are wearing all white and
kind of the shape of a trash bag so here
we go we just got this giant oversized
sweater that I got from forever 21 from
the men's section it was I think twenty
dollars I believe so we had to dress it
up and paired it with a couple new
splurge presents to myself oh my god
I freaking love it did you catch that I
almost just fell over so anyway uh I
guess we'll move on to my shoes Boop I
got some fancy fun shoes which were $20
on Amazon that's always the secret to
looking good kids
paired nice things with cheap things
you'll never know the difference between
what's what got me a nice short hair-do
because I just felt like cutting it
yesterday throw on some groove tastic
sunglasses too and voila there are trash
bag inspired look oh whoa we go boo boo
actually the door is this way due to
didn't son boom alrighty so we're gonna
try target is our first stop to buy well
trash bags whoa-ho-ho alrighty here we
go
wow the fashion selection is endless ok
sir I don't really know what to pick but
we're just gonna get a bunch of white
and black trash bags and that'll be that
I really should have had this video
sponsored by glad but anyways we're
gonna go how to get the cheaper option
anyway please look like they'll do
alright so I also need to get a base to
the dress so let's see what we can find
no no no no no no no actually I think
this might be perfect
oh ok no it's time to get crafting okay
let's stop on the journey Johanns can
you even see me in here really okay whew
it's taped heaven in here perfecto
all right so we're back um I'm gonna
just show you what I got and we can get
started so first of all um look at this
I finally got a coffee table oh my god
it's beautiful so I'll show you my whole
house soon when it's done it's not done
but at least I have a somewhat of a set
up now so any Newsies here we go what we
got this looks like a really weird
version of Fifty Shades of Grey but
anyways okay so what we've got is the
base of the dress which I got like a
black bodysuit thing I have literally no
idea how I'm gonna do this but we're
gonna you know figure it out I got some
duct tape some scotch tape and of course
our trash bags so what are we gonna do
like I said no idea but look this at the
very least it'll be interesting so here
we go let's get started okay so we're
gonna go ahead and decorate the bodysuit
with the trash bags so what I decided to
do was take the trash bag like this and
you can see I just kind of stretched it
out and then cut it into little pieces
and curled them into little tiny knotted
rose balls tada
cute take some of the black tape to tape
it all in place and put them repeat the
process until you've got lots and lots
of roses I can't believe I forgot to
show it earlier but we're whipping out
the good old trusty 6-thousand glue
wouldn't be my DIY without it so we're
gonna go ahead just rub it onto the
bodysuit like that you know make a mess
that's whatever you're not be able to
see it anyway and then just go ahead and
slay them on the bodysuit like this you
can see once they're all patted on there
it kind of starts to look like a weird
rosy fabric this takes approximately
five billion years but eventually it
looks like this next we're gonna want to
put roses on the straps so you can see I
already did this side so how I did that
was since the strap is a little too thin
what we're gonna want to do is take some
of the tape and just you know make it a
little wider by adding that on to
increase the width and then just go
ahead and stick the roses right on to
the straps just like you did the
bodysuit Wow
this is honestly this better than
jaehyun's oh great okay um anyways
what's next so next we have our skirt
which I actually was gonna wear this to
Coachella but I ended up not wearing it
so anywho Zee what we're gonna do is
decorate the bottom of the skirt to
match the top so we're just gonna take
bigger trunks of the trash bags and roll
those up just like we did before into
nice little bigger rose trash bag balls
sidenote ignore all the glue on my hands
I just had to glue those on for like
four hours but anyways just went ahead
and put those on the bottom of the skirt
like so using some e6000 glue and voila
eventually it starts to look like this
side note I made such a mess of my house
oh my god we're gonna go ahead and want
to layer them up a little bit just to
create a little more dimension so we're
gonna do the same things stick the
little trash bag roses on in kind of a
weird zig-zag pattern it can totally
look like a mess after all this is a
trash bag anyway you can kind of do
whatever you want there's no wrong way
to do it and 300,000 years later oh my
god it is 2:00 a.m. again I love
crafting so much I just get so carried
away and will stay up like literally all
night I really need to work on my time
management skills but all right are you
guys ready to see the finished product
on okay you guys are you ready to see it
hmm I really don't think any of you are
ready for this oh my I don't even know
what to say I literally took my own self
on this one you can see all of the
individual trash bag roses Couture
flowers make such a luxurious little
bottom Oh tres sexy for the trash bag
Saint Laurent and tres packs
no that is a mood someone says your
trashy it's nothing but a compliment
obviously I think this is my best DIY
I've ever done so there you have it you
