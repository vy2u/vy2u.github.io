black just kidding you guys know I'm
single a second definitely not getting
married
but anyways laughs you guys ever welcome
back to my channel and today we're doing
a very fun wedding related project in
the spirit of the royal wedding this
weekend I thought it'd be fun to go
ahead and do a twist on a DIY wedding
dress by making one out of toilet paper
why I don't know but I think it's gonna
be fun so I don't really know what we're
gonna do but we're gonna see a what kind
of creative fabulosity as we can create
from wedding expo and a bunch of toilet
paper so without further ado here we go
making a wedding dress out of toilet
paper this is gonna be good
all righty I'm always before we get
going here in our outfit of the day
which dare I say is almost oh I hope
it's casual just got a plain black tank
top a plain black skirt but I got also
on eBay still fun would it be my outfit
without some fabulous shoes Oh baby look
at those incredible simple vibe but I
wanted it to be like a little bit of 90s
inspired so there we go gonna get
married I left my purse inside alright
first opportunity Target to get some
toilet paper Wow look at the haute
couture okay so uh I never thought I'd
be in a store looking for the prettiest
toilet paper but uh we got plain we got
stripes blue that's pretty sold um to
the next stuff well actually that's all
I have to buy it first but then we're
off to the next time boo all righty now
that we got the zoo main ingredient
we're gonna go get the rest of the
goodies the beautiful top-down Los
Angeles so first things first we got to
get a base for the dress tt we can find
whoa look at all the choices whoa whoa
whoa so many options what am I going to
do yep I think this one so next up is
most guitars oh my gosh I literally love
this craft store it's like the greatest
craft store in the world plus memories
playing banging music
this is what we're looking for in here
so we'll grab a couple of those alrighty
this of all we need from here so we're
just gonna wait in the really long line
and head out for this video but of
course a visiting Benjamin anyway so we
are officially back from our rendevouz
outside and we're inside so uh anyways
here's what I got lots of things today
but obviously we got some toilet paper
so this is the toilet paper we're gonna
use we got a little bustier thing for
the base of the dress a headband some
modge podge and uh oh this tutu looking
think of a jigger for well I'm not
really sure how we're gonna make this
via skirt but we're gonna work on it and
literally still do not know exactly what
I'm gonna do here but uh here we go
let's get started
so we're gonna go ahead and start with
the bodice so we just took a lovely roll
of toilet paper and ripped off a small
piece of it then I went ahead and took
some modge podge which is basically like
fancy craft glue oh it's so fun and then
I just plopped it right onto the toilet
paper and rolled it up into a little
sausage thingamajiggy I know what this
looks like but this is a rated G
tutorial you guys we're making a dress
diamonds not drugs kids diamonds not
drugs so let that dry for a second and
then once it is we're gonna go ahead and
just glue it right on to the dress we're
gonna without our trusty e6000 glue
because it wouldn't be my video without
it take the cord and glue it right on to
the corset buddhu to do to do great keep
on gluing them side by side until they
create a full corded pattern all over
the corset looking fanciful now for the
top little part of the dress we're gonna
decorate it kind of the same way I did
the trash bag dress how I twisted the
trash bags and made them into little
roses we're just gonna do the same thing
with this and twist it ease into little
tiny flowers we're just gonna go ahead
and decorate the whole bodice with them
so we're gonna glue them all over the
bottom glue them all over the top put it
all over the place however you heart
desire it until it looks like this wow
this looks better than I thought okay so
now we're gonna do this skirt which like
it's like we have this bottom under a
skirt thingy so basically what we're
gonna do is stick
it it's way too hard to decorate the
skirt as is so I actually bought another
skirt and layered it on top so it would
be easier to decorate and what we're
gonna do now is the same thing we
already did but bigger bigger is always
better and in this case and in diamonds
so what we're gonna do is take the
toilet paper roll it all up into big
floral a balls and we're just gonna glue
them in order completely covering the
entire skirt until well it's covered
what's also covered in glue my hands oh
my god this is so disgusting look I need
to wash these but for now we're gonna
continue the project I'll wash them
later so we're gonna go ahead and trim
off the excess tool from the bottom of
the skirt like so and we're gonna use
that to make the veil so you can see we
got the little headband thing and what
we're gonna do again is the same thing
more little flowers glue them right on
one by one until you kind of create like
a little floral headband looking look
blue the extra fabric from the skirt
into the inside of the headband so it
creates a veil effect and then tada we
have finished it kind of it looks some
really really weird laying on the floor
like this so we're gonna try it on if
you're wondering how long this took me
it took literally a full day and a half
I did it all day yesterday well into the
night and woke up again this morning to
continue making a dress and also making
possibly the biggest mess I've ever made
in my house oh my god I don't even know
what to say this is embarrassing okay
are you guys ready to see dun dun da dun
tensed up dun dun set out and sit on
Santa oh snap

paper wedding dress up
Jevon she who it's me cha-cha-cha Simon
the bodice came out absolutely amazing
you can see the detailing on there you
would never know in a million years you
can see this is the bottom fully made of
little paper rolls some of that's
actually unraveling down there but you
know you can see just oh yes it is I the
new touches of the bathroom I don't even
want to know what kind of next little
bad luck this is for my own real-life
love life but you know hey whatever huh
needs a bathroom break when you're
wearing the bathroom be honest a really
how you're supposed to wear a veil like
this is not correct but you know Pegasus
of this video it's whatever the fact the
veil is really getting on my nerves so
we're taking it off but oh no I would
say we absolutely make freakin nailed it
