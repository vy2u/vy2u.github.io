for you today

us all on oh my god what's up guys it's
amber welcome back to my channel as you
probably guessed it's not ariana because
well duh but today and continuing my
series on making celebrity looks for
less I just figured um since ariana is
one of my favorite celebs out there why
haven't I done her yet I have no idea so
today we're gonna go ahead and make this
fabulous ariana grande look oh look at
that girlfriend looked fire and that one
so we're just gonna go downtown I'm
gonna get some supplies and we're gonna
come back and see if we can recreate
Queen Ahri's looks so without further
ado here we go
make me a tea I on a cloud days clothes
brokerage style of course
all righty as always before we get going
here is our outfit of the day obviously
today I thought it'd be fun since we are
channeling Arianna for the DIY to
channel her with everything else - so
we've got my funky licious re-inspired
hairdo then ariana loves oversized
things so we've got an oversized white
wool t-shirt I got this from Target
yesterday better with a fun little white
schoolgirl skirt and of course it
wouldn't be a nori look without some
shoes so we've got some patent leather
white boots so fun gold glittery Arianna
makeup just for fun - oh here we go
that's our ariana grande inspired look
of the day I know off to downtown
well well well can you guess where we
are
ah oh that's slipped how anti-climactic
hang on we're moving Benjamin so let's
see where is oh he's busy today there's
so many people in here why are so many
people in here this is my store no I'm
kidding okay hi Benjamin it means a big
star now that you guys all know who he
is guys need to stop coming in and
inflating his ego Oh No all right so we
need something that looks like this I'm
not entirely sure what this is but
something tells me he'll have exactly
whatever maybe that my goodness so many
options I think we found the winner so
uh I think we got the goods now onward
hello are you ready to see what's in the
bag migrated hall for the nicer lighting
over here so here we go here is what
we're going to need for this project
first things first
alrighty so again we migrated the hall
to over here because the lighting is
better hi guys okay so here we go what
you're going to need for this project we
got we got some big mesh panels with the
fringe attached to them so you can see
these are gonna be pretty easy to cut up
and make into a dress then we also got
some little oh we got a hair tie we got
some little fabric e trim that is going
to be like kind of like the lining like
this part of Ariana's dress of course I
can't just make a dress out of
see-through material I got a little body
con um kind of under dress thing and
this is what I'm going
end up sewing these on too so we're
going to need some sort of little
undergarment thingy Oh a fun feathery
boa because it wouldn't be complete
without the drama
grab some fab sinners one of you guys
actually sent these to me my p.o box I
love them thank you and some good old
needle and thread and that is all we're
going to need to complete this project
what a strange pile okay here we go all
right here we go first things first you
can see I just went ahead and laid out
the little dress right here and in order
to make it look like good ol arias all
we're going to do it is so the little
fringes right on to the dress so go
ahead and lay it out like you can see I
put the top piece on here ooh la la
now all we're going to do is trim off
this excess mesh and we are going to
stitch it right on so you can see just
trim right along the seam here like so
until all is is a piece of the fringy
fabric so here you can see the dress
without any of the fringe on it I know I
know
ignore the underwear line and the mess
in the background I've got a lot going
on okay now that it's all trimmed we can
just go ahead lay that on there bust out
our needle and thread and get to sewing
go to fashion over under over under
until it's also Thanh whoo there you go
you can see the first piece I sewed on
there is all in place the only thing is
you can see from the side here I didn't
sew on the side so go ahead stitch that
down just so it stays on
I'm gonna head through this on the
mannequin just to make it a little
easier on myself when I'm sewing sew sew
no I went ahead and just took more mesh
sewed it on until the entire dress was
covered and in typical me fashion it is
now night time so it is taking me so so
long to do this but and I've made it
such a mess
but you can see the dress has sparkles
all over it now
Oh 360 degrees so now the only part
that's missing is you can see the little
bra strap part up here so we're gonna
take that crystal trim that I got
earlier and just stitch that right on to
there and around the front part of the
dress just where Ariana's was so again
more sewing and eventually after all
this time fourteen hours later we're
done so are you ready for the fashion
show
oh are you guys ready for this ahh you
can see it looks freaking amazing friend
looks incredible
oh my god I'm living even the boat a cha
cha cha cha cha the only thing is I
didn't realize this was so low-cut so
oops
but anyways of course we got her hair in
the cat ears for dramatic effect I
actually got these ears on Amazon for
like a buck so simple coal went ahead
and made a choker out of the left over
of this crafty crafty I am and voila I
would say we freaking killed it
but surprise I know I'm wearing a
totally different outfit that I was
wearing earlier but um that's because I
honestly just got too distracted when I
was filming last night and just
completely forgot to film an outro so
we're gonna do it right now I guess I
actually don't really even have anything
to say but there you go
