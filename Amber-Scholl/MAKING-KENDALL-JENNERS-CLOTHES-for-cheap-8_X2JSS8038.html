channel so today based on the success in
my last video when I made Kim
Kardashian's clothes I thought it would
be super fun to go ahead and make her
sister's clothes too so today we're
going to go downtown to the shops and
we're going to do a little DIY our
clothing project a la Kendall Jenner so
without further ado here we go I'm
totally kidding umm if you guys saw that
last video you're probably like super
confused like who is this why do I
suddenly have an accent I don't have an
accent
I just really love Australia and really
want to go so you're trying to do the
whole like what you put into the
universe what you get out of it things
so like I'm trying to really put all the
I want to go to Australia vibes out
there mmm namaste okay
Australia anyways
so like I said so many of you guys
enjoyed the Kim Kardashian clothes
making video I just thought it would be
fun to go ahead and do um a similar
twist on it and go ahead and make some
of Kendall Jenner's clothes because girl
has some fire style
so I'm just gonna take you guys along
for the ride we're gonna go pick out
some stuff and then I'll come home and
make a make the get up to the best of my
abilities so here we go
without further ado making Kendall
Jenner's clothes I'm kidding don't worry
I want to the accent the whole time just
most of the time I'm kidding again
seriously capsule for the day alright
here we go
Oh ready as always before we get going
here is our outfit of the day um today
was very like Japanese inspired I don't
know what kind of mood this was but I
was like living for it so what do we
have here like this like silky cool
floral kimono robe matching shorts white
bodysuit oh la la so fun throw on those
nude shoes I'm literally always wearing
because I love them so much
matching rose gold Sunny's that I really
need to clean because they're very dirty
and voila that is the outfit of the day
I just wish I brought my purse though so
hang on fabulous it's so glamorous mmm
all right here we go
alright guys we are officially in
downtown Los Angeles um and if you guys
are like amber wise your hair down I
don't know it just like I got annoyed
with it being up it looks bad on camera
so it's down now anyways who cares this
though this is downtown and we're gonna
pick up some of the fabric for the
project all right so we're popping in to
Jasmine fabrics you see all the amazing
fabrics that are downtown it's like
literally the best oh my god look at all
the sparklies oh but I think this one's
the winner this one also weighs 300 tons
like it's huge but uh we're gonna make
it work so here we go
mmm do you want to be in the video this
is my new friend Peter my official
fabric dealer so we can add Peter to the
fam of Benjamin so now we have Peter new
character you'll be seeing more of him
alright we're also gonna hit up this
store top trims for what else trims look
at this it's a forest of feathers please
in the world look at this we've got all
the feathers Andrew look at the color
match on that woo such an aesthetic so
now that we've got everything onward ho
all righty good morning um so today is
actually the next day of yesterday I
came home I was too tired to film this
so today I'm up and like 7 p.m. because
I wanted to get started you can see it's
our like my sister's even sleeping on
the couch she's a really rough sleeper
so she will not wake up during this
don't worry she will not wake up even if
I screamed so um here we go you ready to
see the boy die gold alrighty so I
really didn't buy too much for this
project all we've got here is um of
course the beautiful fabric that we're
going to use for you know obviously the
main fabric is Kendall's dress we've got
that book out pretty o glittery
beautifulness we also got some feathers
for the feather trim then it'd be fab I
went ahead and picked up a zipper I'm
not really entirely sure how I'm gonna
put this together but it's fine we'll
figure it out
so I'm matching thread to match and some
really groovy scissors which were really
expensive they were like 23 dollars so
these better be amazing scissors so
there we go
that is all we got for this project just
kidding how could I forget the most
exciting part oh I finally bought a
sewing machine oh look how beautiful he
is my new child you guys know I usually
just sew things together right hand and
glue stuff but today I'm actually going
to attempt to sew it together like a
real professional so I've literally
never sewed in my life if I have no idea
what I'm doing
I literally just took a sewing class
this morning for like 30 minutes and had
someone show me how to use this shoutout
to good ol George for showing me the
ropes I should know the basics now so
without further ado um let's get started
hopefully I remember something alrighty
so we can see Kendall's dress here like
I said I don't really know how to do
this so basically I think I'm just gonna
eyeball it and cut this up and see what
kind of robe like pattern I can make so
basically I'm sorry this tutorial makes
literally no sense because after I cut
the fabric randomly I basically just had
to try it on until I kind of started to
look like something I could stitch
together like you can see here I
eventually got arms kind of so you can
see I just literally drape to this over
my shoulders and then I pinned it so I'm
gonna see if when I cut this fabric kind
of like along here if I can just sew
that together so it'll be an arm I know
that makes no sense but work with me
like I said don't really know
we're gonna make it work I have faith so
the first thing I'm going to do is uh
thread the machine which to be honest I
kind of forget how to do but we're gonna
try this really quick I know this goes
on here it's all I know gonna have to
read the directions literally what oh no
I wish George was here with me after a
billion hours I finally figured out the
sewing machine and started to just
randomly sell things
yeah no pattern no directions I just
kind of wing to the whole thing again
not recommended but for the purposes of
this video just please go with it okay
so you can see I've successfully made
sleeves um both sleeves which are
conjoined like this kind of like a weird
I don't even know what you'd call this
but mission accomplished so by some
miracle of God eventually pinning it and
trying all these weird ideas I finally
got it to look kind of good
this took like nine hours by the way
it's much harder than it looks but
eventually I came up with this idea if
we slip this piece of fabric back on Oh
ready for this voila it's really
starting to look like a coat so um I
think I'm gonna go ahead and trim the
sleeves and add the feathers on those
and then we'll get to the dress I was
gonna sell these but I got lazy so you
know huh trusty e6000 glue does the
trick - okay so it's literally nighttime
because I've been doing this for so long
but you can see this is really starting
to look like a jacket so now we're gonna
make the dress again since I'm
eyeballing everything I'm just gonna go
ahead and wrap the fabric around me
gonna trim that up then I'm just gonna
sew that together using the zipper
this was harder than it looks it took me
like four tries but Tom the zipper is
now on and ruop dress fits kinda well I
mean for my first thing I think it's
pretty good alright there we go this
dress will do the trick it's cute
I love it so um now I'm just gonna go
ahead and throw on the rest of it and we
will be ready to go all righty so just
throwing the little jacket bolero
thingamajigger that I made and now for
the grand finale part alrighty are you
guys ready for this this is gonna be
pretty good so
and wallah I'm actually gonna go ahead
and fix my hair really quick cuz it
looks terrible but um one second there
we go much better but tonight you can
see the finished product um definitely
isn't it perfect or anything but I think
you know for my first ever sewing
project it came out pretty good you can
see we got the feathery fluff äj--
we've got the little dress we've got the
feathers on the back to accent the booty
blue we're ready to go to the yacht
party in-cab though there might be a
little dramatic but you know I think
this looks pretty good so be real happy
you guys that was me attempting to make
Kendall Jenna's clothes I know this was
like literally the worst tutorial ever
um but that's just because I really
don't know what I'm doing I really just
wanted to share with you guys on my
first little sewing adventure so I hope
you guys enjoyed and thanks for watching
anyways like I said I think for my first
thing this came out pretty dang good I'm
definitely gonna go enroll in some
sewing lessons like stat because uh I
want to learn how to make things even
more fabulous my dad always says you got
