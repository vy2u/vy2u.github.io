welcome back to my channel and today we
are up bright and early though you guys
can't tell this but it is literally like
8:00 in the morning and I'm already in
full glam but I'm always like that but I
did also curl my hair today Ruru I never
do that so that special though that has
nothing to do with this video so let's
do the video anyways so last night I was
on Instagram like I always am and I
happen to scroll past my beloved
Kimberly's picture and she was in this
fabulous Haute Couture beaumond getup
which I was just like dying over it
looks amazing and since I haven't sent a
DIY in a while I thought I would go back
to my roots and recreate her look just
like I always do so so that's why we're
up so early we're going to go downtown
get some materials and I'm going to come
back and make it and show you guys the
finished product so without further ado
here we go making Kim Kardashian's club
alright be tada right here in heaven the
sparkliest most glamorous place in the
world
now I'm kidding but cool I do love this
door so this is Imperial trim and bees
my all-time favorite crystal shopping
store you can see why whoa whoa Oh could
you just die incredible so I have
journeyed here to pick up some stuff for
the project look at them all oh my god a
WoW sparkly and it doesn't stop there
sir over here - look at how magnificent
it is I want to live in this wall
ok guys do I drop this fabric get the
crystals get measured there's the whole
like trim on the before and look at all
of you ah just crystal heaven in here so
here we go you guys I got her good now
we're going to go home and make the
project but uh first I thought I would
feature my crystal dealer Benjamin if
you want to say anything I on the crease
of the very often the best yo he talked
me up with all of the most fabulous
crystals in LA so thanks my dude come
visiting here Oh a mood now that's more
like it
I just love the store but since I have
to make the project we're going to go
home now so me and the good onward ho I
was about to leave but then I had to
show this to okay now we're really
leaving by the way you guys I've known
another one to see this as IV so yeah
you have anything you want to say to you
I love you very much I love your videos
you guys are literally be care to come
through they're so bougie girl thank you
so it was a smart cookie she came all
the way to Imperial Co so and it was a
good stuff it yeah because it is perfect
off you guys so anyways that's all just
want to show you and back to the video i
swear i'm actually going to craft in
this video I know I just didn't like not
doing anything but I swear we're really
going now so
yeah I guess yeah all right God now I am
in the comfort of my own home so I'm
just going to go ahead and show you what
I'm going to use to make this project so
here's what I got um which I just
realized you totally can't see on the
white carpet so I'm going to move
already much better so this is what we
got for this project basically all
you're going to need this is kind of
like large panel mesh fabrics with
crystals already embossed on them so
that is going to be this part of Kem's
skirt which is just kind of like the
paneling part and then for this little
summer part on the center which you
can't really see so let me show you
about a little better there we go you
can see if you zoom in there that is
also crystals too and for that we're
going to use it so tada
you can see this right here just like
little crystal trim probably going to be
some scissors and some trusty e6000 glue
and then the only other thing you're
going to need is good old trusty needle
and thread and that is all we're going
to need to complete the masterpiece
which right now looks like a disaster
but I swear it's going to look cool and
with any DIY the first step is always to
map it out if you want it to look like
this make it look like this okay so what
you want to do is lay the one piece of
fabric down upside down because that is
going to be the back of the skirt and
then we're going to lay what is going to
be the front of the skirt on top of that
come on so you can see I also left a big
slit in here because you can see
obviously Kim does a slit there on the
thigh so I left a little spot for that
and then all we've got to do please
dismiss it but but Lena like I said I
had roommates and they hate being in my
videos but she's great
any movie back to the craft hey there we
go you can be the basic outline is done
and now literally all we've got to do is
sew the puppy together and unfortunately
that my friends is going to be the hard
part
but here we go oh thank God for
fast-forwarding I'm in a time lapse at
for you random side note I don't know
what the heck Kim is wearing under hers
but I went ahead and got some nude
high-waisted underwear and that is what
is going to keep everything you know not
Folio so this is super weird but
basically you're just going to take the
little panel of fabric and kind of
put onto your bodies you can see where
you want to place it and then you're
just going to sell the fabric on to the
underwear you can see I made a mental
note of where I wanted it and then I'm
just going to go ahead and sew it in
over-under over-under until it's tacked
into place all right there we go we got
sewed on there and then we've got the
other piece sewed on there so now we're
going to go ahead and do the front piece
because obviously this is the back and
we still need you know a front so go
ahead just take the second piece of
fabric lay it on top of there make sure
you leave enough room for the split but
before I sew the next panel on to the
underwear I think I'm actually going to
go ahead and use the trim so that on
first though to put the trim onto this
piece of fabric honestly I was going to
hand sew it but I just got really bored
and didn't want to do it so instead
we're gonna whip out the glue and glue
it right on so just take the e6000 glue
plop a couple of dollops on there and
then press the trim onto those and let
it drive and voila
alrighty so we're just going to let this
dry and then I will sew it all back
together the way you guys pardon the
fact that it's literally nighttime it's
been taking me five million years to do
this but it is finally ready to be sewed
on so we will officially sew them
together now that the glue is all dry
whew look at that oh yeah alright so I
know I said so this but I actually
changed my mind I realize you wouldn't
be able to get it on and off so instead
just sew the back piece like you can see
the front panel here just so the one
side of the panel right here just sew
that onto the back you can see my
strings are a little messed up but you
know you get the point and then when you
put it on I'm just going to go ahead and
use literally a giant safety pin um and
tuck it under kind of sneakily so you
can't really see it that way I can take
the skirt on and off and it will be a
fabulous all-rounder the finished
product so time for my favorite part of
any project whoa whoa I could look at
this forever
alrighty are you guys ready for this no
no no no tah-dah Oh baby look at that
tears can see the finished product I
went ahead and paired it with the most
similar white band oh I could find this
one was from H&amp;amp;M it's like $5.99
I think you can see our left to slit
even a little bit more open just because
it was fun why not and you can see it up
close here on the side look how good
that came out oh my gosh
Oman whoo it's me
Amber's YouTube channel I even busted
out my new TV dupes for this just so we
could really match Kim and voila
that is look Wow
Kim knew what she was doing when she
picked this out oh baby
so Barry know how that you guys that is
how I made Kim's fabulous skirt for much
less as you saw I'm actually called balm
on because I don't know how much the
skirt really cost and they said any
custom piece like that would be anywhere
from 15 to 20 thousand dollars and mine
was a whopping 220 so I know that's
still not super cheap but you know I
mean I did save approximately fourteen
thousand dollars so I would say it's a
win and by the way it since I'm friends
with the guy from the crystal shop if
you guys want you discount code amber
shoal 20 by the way yes I am filming
this in a different outfit because this
