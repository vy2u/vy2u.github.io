amber this is literally so weird a that
you can see my butt in the mirror there
that's weird but even weirder and I
literally never wear red lipstick on
camera so mmm who is she
huh do you even recognize me anyways so
Sifl series was so popular on my channel
I've already done cam and I've already
done Kendall so how could I miss the
Queen herself miss Kylie so I'm gonna go
ahead and make this little bomb on look
so we're just gonna go downtown see what
kind of materials we need to get to and
come home and throw it all together so
without further ado here we go making
Kylie Jenner's clothes Brooke which
style of course whoo all righty
as always before we go here's our look
of the day I don't know why I'm so
dressed up to go shopping and sorry
about the mess on the floor I know I
always say sorry for the mess on the
floor as if like it's never not a mess
so I think you guys are catching the
drift that my room is just always a mess
but anyways that's where I look hmm
here it is ooh so cute so today we're
wearing a little white crappie top
things of course those ripped jeans that
I wear all the time I love them of
course the look wouldn't be complete
without a little bit of Kylie haha you
know we're already taking inspo from her
no look of mine would be complete
without some fake designer duds so um
super cute any white pumps would look
great but you know we're gonna just keep
that on the DL so there we go that is a
look of the day and off we go sorry miss
I'll deal with you later
all righty we are hitting up my favorite
store of course where I bring you every
time because first of all this model is
slang and second of all it's my favorite
all right so now that we're here we're
gonna see what kind of crystal and
nonsense we can find all right so we're
looking for something kind of like this
so let's see what we got in here hmm
this could maybe work hmm or maybe
something like this and I could add the
fringe to the bottom firm so many
options
got the e6000 glue sand their natural
habitat oh do you have anything you want
to say today nope Thank You Benjamin
you're the bear all right look at this
we got our goods
we will onward hope I love meeting you
if you ever see me in this store always
say hi yeah I'm so excited yeah it is my
god yeah I could live in here
alright well enjoy your shopping thank
back to crafting alright so we're
officially back home so I'm just gonna
show you the materials I got for this
project alrighty so for this project all
we're going to need is a black t-shirts
like Kylie's I get this one from Lulu's
it's just a cute little black tee of
course we need some e6000 glue because
it wouldn't be my project without it's
some scissors and of course look at this
it literally could not believe I found
this when I found it but good old
Benjamin always come in through
literally this is just like a little
mesh applique which happened to already
have the fringe at the bottom so I dyed
this is perfect and that is all we need
to do this project it's an easy one you
guys really easy okay so the first step
of this project is I'm going to go ahead
and cut the little mesh off of at the
outside because you can see I definitely
don't want this part I just want this
part so I'm gonna go ahead kind of trim
that around and then brought a big white
a boom until it is all just one piece
fabulous I feel like the staples guy
where's the button but oh that was easy
alright and here is the grand for now
all we're going to do is take this lay
it right on to our black t-shirt voila
and then we're gonna glue it on okay uh
you know what actually we're gonna
scratch the glue idea so here's a fun
story time my DIYs don't always work out
the first time I did them because like I
said I never tried them before I do it I
just literally go for it so sometimes I
mess up like this time uh the glue
wasn't strong enough to hold the
crystals onto the shirt it just kind of
fell off and all it ended up doing was
thoroughly staining my shirt so so we're
gonna switch gears go ahead use a needle
and thread which is much easier over
under over under until it is all sewn
perfectly on to the t-shirt
now that it is also done I'm gonna go
ahead and put it on and show you the
finished product
whoo Kylie it's gonna be shook Wow
right so you can see am I really trying
to even do my hair like Kylie's but that
look was a little harder to achieve but
I thought but you can see the shirt came
out so stinkin cute pull them on whoo
ohh ohh
lookin good girlfriend lookin good
like look at this popping video for my
instant story oh that is a good-looking
shirt nailed it
so there you have it you guys that is
how I made miss Kylie Jenner's clothes I
hope you guys enjoyed the video because
I'm living I loved it I loved making it
and I love you so lots of cheese today
um I don't really have anything else to
tell you but since this video was so
short I'll just tell you another quick
thing I had chia seed pudding for the
first time the other day and it was Bob
and also if you haven't watched Titanic
recently I watched it on the plane home
from New York and hwa-jung leo is a
treasure

anything so as always on my social there
