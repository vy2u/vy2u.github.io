2018 how crazy is that that it's already
2018 like I feel so old and crusty I
swear I still remember in New Year's Eve
1999 so uh someone signed me up for the
old folks home I'm kidding I listened to
One Direction this morning so I still
got a little bit of young left in me
so what is up you guys it's amber
welcome back to my channel and today
we're going to doing a very special
video one that I wanted to do for a long
time a video all about with my beloved
mood Ward's every year we make a mood
board of things I want to accomplish in
the new year and I totally sound
dramatic saying this but I really truly
believe these mood boards have changed
my life so today I'm making my 2018 mood
board and I thought um it'd be fun to
film it so you guys could have a little
bit of life in spo2 and make your
aluminous so without further ado here we
go a very moody video mood boards
okay so basically the mood boards are
all about something called the law of
attraction which if you've never heard
about that before it's basically how to
put it in like really easy terms it's
basically the law of attraction is if
you believe in something enough the
universe will kind of conspire to bring
it into your life so thoughts become
things if you think about it all the
time and you really believe in it it
will come true oh it sounds like some
kind of crazy witchcraft but seriously I
totally totally believe that it works
100% and the wood boards are just a way
that I use it in my own life to really
make sure that I'm focusing on the
things that I want so they can all come
true so before I scare you away with any
crazy ideas here's what you need for
this project and we can get started
all right so literally all you need for
this project is a Ford I went ahead and
got a bag of white poster board but some
tape to tape things on and of course
you're in spouse
so what do you put on a mood board well
ask yourself what do you want so here
are some of the things that I want to do
this year and for example something I
really want to do is go to Australia
this year sir we've got a picture of
Australia perfect I'll explain all of
these things in a second while I put
them on the board but the first thing
that you want to put on the board is a
central quote of the year my first
winner was my favorite quote in the
whole world what if it doesn't come true
but what if it does then last year it
was lived the life you imagined so that
was kind of the mood of that year this
year it's going to be this go get what
you dream of I didn't make that quote up
by the way I was just driving one day
and la super cool with street art and
whatever and I saw it on the side of the
road I mean I thought it was super
inspiring so that's we're gonna put on
the center of mine this year go ahead
and slap that right smack dab in the
middle of the bowl that's not really the
middle but whatever so I get that here
you can see a bunch of the things that I
need to put on my mood board and like I
said before you want to get super super
specific with these when I say get
specific I mean get specific Photoshop
things like I want to grow my channel
even more this year so what do we got
here my channel so like instead of
saying get more subscribers show it look
at it every day as if it was real that
is how you're going to attract
into your life you want to think really
big for your mood board but also make
sure it's realistic goals that you can
actually achieve like I wouldn't put
Mary into the royal family because that
doesn't make any sense because they're
all already married but else I really
want to do is adopt a puppy so you can
see I found this little guy oh my gosh
how cute is he so we'll put him on there
I want to write a book this year I want
to be on a talk show
this is Ellen waiting for me I want to
win some sort of an award I don't know
what but some sort of award this one
actually represents something super
funny guys are constantly commenting
that I remind you I'm the character from
inside out which I've never seen until
this winter break and I loved it it was
so cute so thank you I'm flattered and
so I would love to avoid a character for
an animated to something um so I kind of
Photoshop myself to pretend like I
voiced her over vision boards got to
make it seem real before it happens this
is my fave girl Tammy hen bro I want to
get in this kind of shape so I'm gonna
be motivated this year and I'm actually
gonna start working out it's gonna be
awesome
this is a koala because when I go to
Australia I want to hold a koala bear I
reach a million on Instagram because I
really want to be verified and I don't
know why they won't verify me yet but I
figured if I have a million followers
they have to verify me so I don't know I
just put that on their Instagram if
you're watching this please verify me I
want the little blue checkmark this is
another one that's really funny okay so
this is Kim we all know I love her I
want to meet Kim this year in a business
setting so there this is me meeting Kim
like I said dream big I would love to be
on Dancing with the Stars at some point
because oh my god the sparkles I just I
have to so I put that on there
we're generic traveling because you know
who knows where I want to go I want to
do some really cool branded collabs so I
put those on there so I can see them I
even threw my signature on here because
it represents a lot of things but I
really want to start my own company this
year so we'll see what's this gonna be
who knows but stay tuned I want to
continue my jewelry line maybe start a
beauty line to be a frickin boss and
tada you can see it kind of comes
together a little bit after a while it
kind of starts to look like a nice
little vision board and left a couple
holes in it because there's some things
that
don't even want to show you guys yet but
I will show you eventually so for now
there we go by the way you can't just
make this mood board and like hope for
the best did not actually do anything to
make them come true obviously you have
to work hard too but um this is just an
important way to help you keep your
goals centered and your eyes on the
prize now I'm just gonna go ahead and
I've never done this before but we're
gonna write 2018 at the top oh you leave
a little space on it so you have some
room to add more goals as they come but
voila there we go so now we're just
gonna go ahead and hang it up in my
bedroom and you're gonna wanna hang it
somewhere you see it every single day so
right here is the wall that I look at
every day so we're gonna put it right
there tada
there we go 2018 in a nutshell let's do
this now I'm not saying I found the
secret to life or anything that's God's
job and always will be but I am saying
that if you truly believe in it enough
kiss it from the top of the city you
guys lab yeah very first time Evers
