up it's amber greetings from my floor
because well today we are doing a
project about shoes which doesn't
explain why I'm sitting on the floor but
you know just go with it my videos don't
really make sense but it's okay it's
endearing right the queen of fashion
herself Rihanna was wearing these the
other day and I just was like freaking
shook oh my God look I'm sorry to be
honest when I saw them my first instinct
was honestly these are so great I have
to buy them but um yeah these were a
cool 10k from suit Laurent
so what better thing that d.i.y so today
I'm gonna take you guys downtown with me
and we are going to see how we can
recreate the a fabulous look so without
further ado here we go
making Rihanna's shoes Brooklyn style of
course
all righty so before we get going here
is my outfit of the day so usually I
would show what we're wearing shopping
but today instead I'm gonna show you
guys what I'm wearing in my house
because I already went shopping so
here's my look of the day killing it in
white on white with a denim top yes this
is what I wear at home in my free time
why not and of course I would never wear
these with this usually because doesn't
really match that good but we've got
boom my fabulous defend tissues just
because this is a Rihanna DIY so we got
a pair our owns to the Queen ooh so cute
also disclaimer really quick before we
get started um I actually filmed me
shopping for this stuff like last week
so ignore the fact that I'm wearing the
same outfit I was wearing in my other
video it's because it was the same day
so like I said my videos aren't that
professional just good ol Imperial trim
and bein so let's see what kind of fun
things we can dig up today
woo it's gonna be a good day there's
sparkles here already it's like I said
I'm not entirely sure what's gonna work
the best for this but uh we're just
gonna try buncha stuff and see what's
the best you can see Benjamin in the
back there he got a haircut this could
work I don't really know um maybe a
fabric instead use something like this
like the fabric and kind of I mean you
see here I just wrapped it around this
tester boot I really don't know what's
gonna be easier but we'll see we'll see
amazing I know
oh my gosh I just realized what's so
weird I'm not wearing rings today I knew
I felt make it for some reason other
than the rips in my jeans alrighty we
got the good time to go crap Wow
right as hell anyway everyone's looking
at me alright alrighty so it is
officially a different day than when I
was filming just then but anyways I deal
my hair in the same positioning anyways
who cares so are you ready to see what I
got to make the shoes mmm great alright
so here's what we got for this project
to be honest it totally kills me the
fact that I'm gonna use these boots
because I love these boots but they are
just perfect length and everything for
this project so get yourself a pair of
boots that you love we're also going to
need some scissors and of course my
fabulous 6-thousand glue this actually
is what we're going to use for this
aspect I'm not just throwing it in here
so yes wouldn't
my DIY without it and um I actually
ended up picking something that didn't
look anything like the crystals from the
other shoes I just thought this was even
better so why not make something with my
own flair so I got them some nice little
crystalline mesh fabric applique stuff
and that is what we're going to use to
make this project hmm I'm so excited
rady so I moved us into her old DIY
station because Lou it was so sparkly in
the Sun here okay so we're going to cut
the crystal applique to go ahead and be
global on to the shoe side note yes
ignore the fact that I'm now wearing a
blue fuzzy coat I was cold and wanted to
wear it so anyways here we go so you can
go ahead and just trim the fabric to fit
around the boots like so it's
snippety-snip buddy and you can see just
kind of mold it around the boot like so
wow this is so sparkly ball oh well and
for the next step we are just continuing
my series of gluing stuff to stuff just
do it on and just go ahead use the e6000
glue and glue it right on tada simple is
that easy peasy lemon squeezy now the
only thing is the top is totally hanging
off so I'm just gonna go ahead and give
this a quick trim glue the top down and
voila perfect I accidentally left this
out and look at how funny that is the
glue like hardened it's like a glue
Icicle sad thing is this is probably the
closest we'll get to snow in Los Angeles
but anyways back to the gluing you can
see here just because the way I glued it
there's an extra space here so I'm gonna
go ahead from the extra fabric trim a
little piece and glue that on right in
place so there's no crystally bald spots
go ahead and do the same thing for the
heel too godd have glitter everywhere
last thing is you're gonna need some
velcro I forgot to include this in the
beginning but that is just because for
this particular pair of shoes their
zipper is on the side so you want to be
able to put them on and off so I'm just
gonna go ahead put the velcro here and
here's so it can stick together and be
all ready to go and voila you can see it
sparkling in the sunshine oh my goodness
these are so beautiful all ready to be
styled up like RiRi so let's try these
puppies on alright you guys tada here we
go here's our finished Rihanna inspired
look white t-shirt the black leather e
jacket some totally banger hoop earrings
and of course the good old ponytail oh
yes honey oversized denim jeans and of
course o Sabbath's
like oh yes mama
Oh whoo and there we go
I would say we did pretty good so there
you have you guys that is how I made
Rihanna's glittery boots
um and it's actually so funny I finished
filming this DIY like four days ago and
like two seconds after I finished
editing at Kendall Jenner posted them I
also saw the Mon Celine Dion I'm like
they're literally on everybody they're
very hot boots this season so this DIY
is very much celebrity in style approved
thank you guys so much for watching
don't forget to subscribe to the channel
for lots more glittery fun nonsense and
I will see you guys next time as always
if you have any questions comments
concerns
oh my socials there's the hair in my
mouth oh all my socials I am Burchell
ups you can hit me up on there and for
now I'm gonna go see if I can figure out
somewhere to wear these two because even
though I technically don't have anywhere
to go today Oh baby I have gots to go
somewhere to show them off so maybe
we'll take a trip to the 99-cent store I
don't know but I love you guys kisses
