Gomez and Justin Bieber the other day
and then did you see our in the weekend
broke up literally like a day later whoa
booty so what if a few guys amber
welcome back to my channel and today
since I haven't done a DIY in a while
and seeing those photos totally reminded
me but I've actually never done anything
paying homage to Selena Gomez I figured
we would go ahead today and do just that
so today we're gonna go downtown and get
some supplies to recreate one of my most
favorite Selena looks ever this one
right here performing at the AMAs ah
look at how beautiful it is still
sparkly so without further ado here we
go making Selena Gomez's clothes Brooke
with style of course
all righty as always before we get going
Harry's our outfit of the day which
today is very spy inspired but mostly
it's Alina inspired this Alina was
actually wearing a very similar outfit
to this the other day out on the town so
I figured we'd go ahead and take a
little it's bow from her so you can see
we got the big black rounds Sonny is of
course a cute little black lacy blazer
this one's from pretty little thing it
was only like 20 bucks on sale paired it
with a ripped denim skirt and too much
the whole look together we've got some
thigh-high black boots no no off to
crafting hmm fabulous alrighty here we
are featuring the beautiful downtown Los
Angeles and my favorite place of all
Benjamins hello Benjamin
[Laughter]
Krystle doer so um I need everyone so um
today we need some crystal like little
circle crystals yeah yeah hook it up
well it's like the best version of snow
ever
this place is such a dream all right
mission accomplished
thank you item number one Chow Benjamin
see you soon on to the next alrighty so
we just got home and here are the
ingredients to make this project just
like hit myself in the face with this
okay anyways alrighty so here's what you
need to make this project a very strange
array of things but first of all you can
see we have a black bra and black
high-waisted underwear that is going to
be what goes underneath this beautiful
little mesh bodysuit thing that I got
downtown for like eight bucks then we're
also going to need of course some
glittery glittery x' whoo thanks
Benjamin and some e6000 glue because
wouldn't be my project without it and
that is all we need to get started oh I
know this is gonna be a fun one so I
just took this out of the container and
it looks literally insane but uh anyways
now that it's open for step Oh girl who
is she
this is literally so funny okay so first
things first to hold the forum we're
just going to go ahead and put the
mannequin in the black bodysuit what you
can see is totally mesh and c3 and now
to glue the crystals alrighty so you can
see on Selena's that's literally just
crystaled all over so that is what we
are going to do we're just going to go
ahead take the e6000 glue and where the
where's the peck of crystals oh okay
it's gonna take the bag of crystals and
glue them right on so you can just go
ahead and take the e6000 glue and throw
whip it on like that
and then go ahead and place the crystals
right on one by one if you want to speed
up the process go ahead and put a bunch
of dollops of glue and then you can do
the crystals all on top and kind of like
a little mask crystalling 70 billion
hours later you will see it will start
to get all crystallized to finish this
it takes a really long time so make sure
you enjoy yourself place the music dance
long you can go ahead and stick a glass
and find the arms and legs to go ahead
and hold the form while you glue the
crystals on and then just do the same
thing glue crystal blabbity blah blah
until it's all completed yes the so ease
