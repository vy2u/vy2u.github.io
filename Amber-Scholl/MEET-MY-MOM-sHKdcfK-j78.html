stay out they didn't party and they
didn't do crazy things they were just
but you know we've always been good pal

what made you choose the name amber is
there any reasoning behind it is there I
don't actually know you know
um not really uh it wasn't like I know
and Nicole was the name I pick up and
didn't go with shoulder Nicole Sholto so
it sounds good
ambush all that sugar just sounded
pretty and it's just a pretty name how
about if I was a boy what were you gonna
name me oh good question
I'm Austin Austin I know now now little
bit lackluster a lackluster any movie
okay next question
describe each other in three ports okay
adventurous type a what do you think of
me
three pursuing sweet happy fun you're so
fun like you're always just fun to be
around
uplifting thank you that said that's
four words mom three words they're three
is not enough Oh mother sucks a spill
some hot tea about amber tea it's like
tell some juicy secret here
she loved just funny once she kind of
slug what you go in house and she and
every little boy I wanted to hold them
all the time yes so I guess no juicy see
I like bug that's was juicy as a good
kid what is the craziest outfit amber
has ever worn oh my god you weep so many
you hated my clothes so her prom dress
was really crazy it's all gold figures
right was it my surprise I loved it it
was it lost a lot yes a lot I liked it
this one's juicy Oh what's something
you've never told me once you tell a
story
maybe maybe another time like you've
never been to jail or like snuck in love
[Laughter]
did do that a lot all the time actually
I mean me too I had a fake ID and
everything oh god I am so nursing and it
was so ridiculously friends were older
so it was hard
I didn't I just wanted to I'll tell you
guys about my clubbing days someday but
for now we're gonna yeah I know about
that sorry I won't tell you okay next
question two more holes in the topic yes
please nice um what do you think about
me making YouTube videos and what did
you think about it when I first started
that's actually really good
that's a good question good question is
at first uh we were like no get a real
job
Wow
we did we did but um Venice she started
getting flowers and she seemed really
happy and then I was just like okay
she's happy and then it's just been
great because yeah that's right all you
really want free can't hear them to be
happy and now we're doing a collab how
crazy laughing follow your dreams
kids never gave up you can do that do
you do that what's the most annoying
thing about me probably that you're
messy oh I feel attack yeah I am a dirty
Dan she literally calls me that
something that annoys me about you oh I
like to be clean okay she's clean and
I'm not very annoying she always is
trying to clean me like we'll be walking
around and she's like let me like clean
your neck and let me like you know your
hair is messed up one let me be 30 in
peace Erica turkey is your taste in
fashion similar to mine no I don't think
so ya know I like to be really
over-the-top and she likes to me kind of
simple but you know we do I mean you
know we're both in jean jackets hers is
you know regular denim and mine is hot
pink of vintage to you or that I got on
eBay
a hundred top incredible sell I'll
explain that later like I said I'm
changing my whole wardrobe but yeah so
we're similar but you know oh I gotta be
a little bit basic basic I like more you
know not basic all right this is a
really nice one what is the most
important thing you have learned from
each other
let's get deep for a second okay she
always knows how to put things in
perspective like if I get upset about
something that's really stupid like who
cares about like a material something
happens or something that's just not
important she always is good about
things not important and think of it
this way the perspective thing yes
that's a good one that I learned from
you I've been thinking about this off
camera for like five minutes nothing I
could say like sounds good enough to
really explain it right
so oh that's a unit actually it burns a
lot from you it's my job so yeah it's
good I guess I did my job a little II
wouldn't be the same without obvious
course not who is your favorite child
me of course don't answer that most
embarrassing story of me as a child did
I do anything embarrassing as a case you
did a lot of things but oh okay all week
we were in a line shopping I can't
remember but a long line and who's the
lady right in front of us and she had a
lot of perfume in the air because and I
was like oh my god if you could swap one
item from each other's wardrobe what
would it be well I've stolen a lot of
stuff already yeah yeah is there
