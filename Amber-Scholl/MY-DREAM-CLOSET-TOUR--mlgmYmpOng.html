did you hear it I was afraid since I
started filming they wouldn't happen and
I would just look like really stupid for
trying to show you guys my hiccups but
up you guys it's amber welcome back to
my channel and yeah I have had that guts
literally all day so if I randomly
hiccup in the middle of this intro
apologies I don't know how to get rid of
them but like most of my intros that has
nothing to do with this video so let's
just get to the point shall we tonight I
thought it would be fun to go ahead and
give you guys a little closet tour
because a lot of you guys have been
asking to see what my closet looks like
and since moving into my new apartment I
finally have my dream closet kind of all
organized sort of asterisk ish so I
thought it would give you a little quick
tour of it so you can see how my closet
life is that sentence made no sense but
that's okay you get the point so without
further ado here we go
my very extra closet to
alright are you guys ready to go inside
ah great I'll take you I have so many
clothes they're like peeking out okay
here we go
da da da
closet I'm sorry the lighting isn't back
right in here I don't know what to do
about it I think it might be the hat
that I'm wearing but also it's the
middle tonight and I have like weird for
Larsen's lighting in here so sorry about
being orange but you know just roll with
it but excited to show you guys this
okay so you can see my closet is kind of
like 360 degrees it goes in a full
circle it's huge it's like a whole
separate room I have literally two doors
counting one door two toys that's the
most number of doors I've never seen all
right so you can barely tell but I kind
of have my closet organized by colors
kind of so this is the really
unorganized side so we'll start here but
you can see I kind of have like all of
the black stuff here all of the whitish
gray things denim like I said this part
isn't organized very well at all but you
can still kind of see there's like a
little bit of a vibe sort of I didn't do
the best job I'm not exactly like the
queen of organizing but you know I tried
by someone who's extremely unorganized
this is a very nice start you can see
all of my hangers are the same - they're
all black little velvet hangers with the
gold heads on them oh so cute and I
always have them all facing the same
direction because I feel like it just
looks more aesthetically pleasing that
way so if we move on from this side we
can go do this sides clothes here I have
more of the basic stuff so I have
literally like a hundred thousand of the
same looking basics I'm obsessed with
these by the way these are from a place
called mash key which I'm like in love
with so I'm always getting things dirty
with my tanning lotion so I just need to
buy multiples of stuff so all of my
basic things are over here like this
jacket is so cool this was actually my
mom's in the 80s how fun is that oh she
looks so cute in it - very extra
personalized stuff like oh my gosh this
is actually a full tracksuit with my
name on the back how fun is that oh look
at that aesthetic gorgeous and now my
personal favorite rack huh beautiful
this is what I call my fancy fur rack
even though it's all faux fur I'm a
vegetarian but I've got my beautiful all
my fluffy things right here because they
look so beautiful together
ah such a mood like look at this Wow
I love it I also have my fancier DIY
clothing on this rack so keep that here
I just feel like this is like the rack
of Honor by the way you guys are always
asking if I actually we're the DIY
clothes I make all the time I made them
I love them all the other weird funky
stuff is on here too like what even is
this I don't know but it still has the
tag on it a lot of my clothes though the
tag on it because I have a shopping
addiction and I buy stuff and don't know
like where to go like where do you go
wearing this I don't know if you're me
you'd wear it to Trader Joe's which
honestly I don't know why I haven't done
that yet so I'm gonna probably do that
later but for now I'll just go ahead and
slip that off actually side note um my
outfit of the day is so cute so pause
we're gonna do that everyone doesn't a
lookbook the other day but it's so cute
I've got my little like train conductor
outfit on little hat with a matching
overall set thing and a turtleneck oh
the cutest little train conductor I ever
did see but anyways back to the tour um
here we go ignore my messy bathroom okay
here we go back inside the heaven land
Wow
oh well I guess we'll go ahead and do
this now because well we're already here
alright so I mentioned in my 10 things
you didn't know about me video the other
day that I have hundreds of bajillions
of pairs of shoes so I like to rotate
them out depending on what my mood is
for the week but these are the shoes
that I currently have on display so here
we go I have a couple of my like
specialty hats up here then you can see
I have a couple of pairs of my shoes
sitting here we got the sparkly ones a
couple fake designer ones you know a
shush Don't Tell then we've got if you
come down here oh I guess we've got my
hats and stuff here so that's fun then
we've got my real designer sneakers over
here so fun so fun oh look at these my
dream babies and these were like the
coolest running sneakers I'd ever seen
so I'll do like a full video of trying
on all my shoes at some point but you
can see we have like literally just a
bajillion more down here oh my crying
kid backpack that's where I keep it so I
can see it every day because it just
makes me laugh every time I see it so I
always wanted on constant constant
display so if I suddenly grow a hundred
inches and I'm on the top here you can
see these are the chandeliers that I
made and my little DIY chandelier video
I have two of them I have one over here
and then the other one
on the other side right here oh you can
see how beautiful those came out oh my
god
stunning stunning stunning all the while
I'm up here I guess I'll show you oh
well more shoes there just in the
background no so I guess huh what do you
think of this more shoes that wasn't
what I was gonna show you but I guess
I'll show you now more shoes right here
in the middle of the two doors I have
this other little shelf II closet things
so this is where I keep um you know more
shoes oh look at how beautiful these are
I just love my shoes I could look at
them all day then we have this kind of
little drawer set up here which is a
built-in drawer thing so I actually I
mean I would say I keep these clean but
I don't um I keep a bunch of spare
hangers in here because I mean I'm a
Shopaholic so I always need to have some
extra hangers for my new goodies then I
have super organized drawers I don't
even remember what's in this drawer hmm
random alright anyways believe it or not
to me these drawers actually are
organized because these are all tops
these are all bottoms so yeah it's
totally a mess inside but at least
they're all kind of the same I want to
say the same genre of clothing but
that's definitely not what I mean so
what do I mean type cat category
category I guess they're all sort of the
same category of clothing so it makes it
easy when I just want to pick something
out really quick on a whim I can it's
called organizational D organization I
just made that up but that's what it is
as my mom would say a professional dirty
Dan so that's that and randomly oh I
guess you can see this too this is kind
of gross but whatever Oh funny is this
little laundry container I forgot this
at t.j.maxx for like ten bucks it was
hilarious um this is where I keep my
dirty laundry I just kind of keep it in
a pile over there so I can just grab it
and do my laundry whenever need be I
have a washer and dryer in my apartment
so super fun like you can see I have
like more dirty clothes here and
randomly there's actually a hole in my
kitchen I didn't know what to put here
so I put a mirror because I need
decorating help so if anyone knows what
to put in this weird hole let me know I
would love advice um but yeah anyway as
you can see that right there so in
addition to my laundry bag on the floor
I also have this beautiful tufted
masterpiece it's like velvet tough too
little Ottoman thing I am obsessed with
it I think it's the cutest ever which
looks way cooler in real life than it
does on camera I don't know why it looks
like it's two different colors but you
know it's fine use your imagination
it's just so soft and fun I got it on
Amazon like a couple days ago so can I
camp out in my closet now we live in
here if I want actually I can't even say
that I'll attempt to myself so let's sit
up and take the rest of the two up okay
so you can also see that in all of the
little above shelfie areas I put all of
my favorite shopping bags and boxes
because they're just so beautiful they
make everything look fabulous and
gorgeous you guys know I love shopping
so there's no shortage of bags to
decorate everywhere so whenever I go
shopping and buy something I just always
save the box like this was from the
perfume that I bought in my haul this
was from buying a lipstick so if you
want to get the fancy bags without
spending a lot of money you can buy a
lipstick for like 30 bucks in the
designer section of department stores
and they'll give you the fancy bag for
free plus I'm a little bit of a hoarder
so I like hate throwing things away so
tie comes in handy that I can say I
collect the shopping bags collecting is
just a nicer word for hoarding but you
know no one has to know that except all
of you guys I guess because I just told
you but okay
anywho is it so most of the bags and
boxes are from my shopping adventures
however this one is special this is so
embarrassing like top-secret information
but back when I was driving for post
mates I was delivering something to this
really fancy bel-air house and I
couldn't help but notice that their
trash outside was like literally
overflowing with fancy things like
Tiffany bags and this box I took it out
of their trash and kept it in my room as
life inspo so if you watch some of my
really old videos you'll actually see it
sitting in the background um yes
so I actually stole this box out of
someone's trash saying that sentence
makes me sound so crazy but it's the I
managed to divide myself quite a few of
my own boxes but this one will always
have a special place in my heart
so that doesn't tell you that dreams do
come true I don't know what does that's
probably illegal FBI if you're watching
this please don't arrest me okay so so
there we go you guys that is pretty much
my closet um I wish I had more exciting
things to tell you about it and to
explain but I really
don't have too much that is my closet um
yeah what else am I supposed to do in
this tour like I feel like I should do
something else I feel like that was
boring I'm singing I'm in a closet and
I'm singing what's that you loved it you
want me to sing more no I'm kidding
don't worry I'll spare your ears but I
thank you guys so much for watching I
hope you enjoyed my little closet tour I
can't believe I used to dig through
people's trash for the designer boxes
and now I'm able to buy my phone and put
them in my very own dream closet I know
I say it a lot but it's true absolutely
nothing I have would be possible without
you guys so thank you so so so so much
from the bottom of my heart having a
million friends who are so soft and kind
and loving and supportive of me and my
dreams um I'm gonna cry again but I told
myself I was gonna stop crying in my
videos because it always messes up my
mascara and that's like not a good look
so just know when I say thank you I
truly truly truly mean it I wouldn't
trade sharing life with you guys for
anything so thank you again for watching
and I'm so amazed by the love and
everything that you guys show me and
each other so thank you for you the best
subscribers in the world the angel fam
truly is the best fam in my own humble
opinion but also it's the truth if
you're new to the fan don't forget to
subscribe to the channel for all sorts
of more fun nonsense and I will see you
guys next time from me and my absolute
dream closet to you kisses till next
time my Angel's XO
Wow
this really is my dream honestly maybe
I'll just sell my apartment and live in
my closet or maybe I'll just convert the
whole thing to a closet honestly I live
alone who's gonna stop me I'm kidding
