want to go for example something I
really want to do is go to us to really
and then be returned to really put all
that I want to go to Australia vibes out
there you're probably wondering how I
got here well let's start from the
beginning
quit way too much luggage because we
suck at packing and by us I mean the
three of us that's my best friend Bailey
on the left and this is Shannon on the
right and that's me amber but you
already knew that after 15 hours on the
plane in a full day of time travel we
landed in Australia jet lag this hell
though I tried to film an intro to this
video like 10 times not a single one of
them made sense but that's okay who
needs an intro so what did we do on my
dream vacation well what didn't we do we
did it all oh my gosh look at it up
close this is so wild I need to touch it
I touched the butt
brought that off the bucket list I
playing opera at the Opera House I was
skipping through the Royal Botanical
Gardens oh look how beautiful saw the
Harbour Bridge drove under the Harbour
Bridge and looked at ourselves in a
funny mirror does this kind of
sightseeing know well it was a funny
sight we stated the crazy of cool hotels
I've literally ever been to like look at
all the marble ah different city
different hotel every night ah so fun
welcome to the shangri-la ken there's
just fountains in the middle of the
lobby I loved it but my personal
favorite was the Versace hotel did you
even know that existed yeah me either
but I flew across the world to find it
and oh boy oh boy oh my god are you guys
seeing that like look at the room the
chandelier uh everything just had me
dying so Instagram bull oh my god are
you kidding me oh and the star roof car
cost more than my entire life Oh
like can I just live here for the rest
of my life please Donatella with a
cherry on top
PS how hot is the bellhop name is Isaac
such a cutie he even gave us extra soaps
after he caught us stealing them off the
housekeeping carts basically we're
getting married you can't go to
Australia and not go to the beach so we
beached we frolicked on the beach ate a
lot of ice cream and Bailey got chased
by a lot of birds just like she did in
London and New York and I laughed even
harder this time
oh my God look at this
literally everything we did was perfect
the only thing we ever had to deal with
was the weather
oh sorry windy maybe and slightly maybe
it's the wind we flirted with men
kinda pleased to trouble you say it
again hey guys how are you doin
oh hello Chris welcoming me to Sydney
are you all right guys we're at the
whole garden
but who needs boys when you got money Oh
beautiful ball man
and we saw this sign this has nothing to
do with the vlog at all but it had me
dying so here it is we even got to stop
in the beautiful Brisbane City which was
so so cool till I saw this spider that
starter is so big then it was not cool
okay it's time to leave Australia we
channeled our inner dr. Seuss and took
trains planes and everything's all over
the town oh look at that yeah anyways
distracting I really need to work on my
vlogging skills okay so did you know
they drive on the opposite side of the
road here ah so weird but I did see this
dog that looked like it was driving the
car so funny speaking of cars we also
took all sorts of transportation we were
silly on boats
Paley's literally holding my arm so i
don't fly off the boats had fun on
trains had fun on planes can you tell
how tired we are in these clips does
this thing count as transportation no
okay but it was cool
we took a sky rail through the rain
forest which even though I'm a little
bit afraid of being dangling in a tiny
box above a giant forest was totally
worth it oh yes traveling through the
broccoli forests while we were there we
even got to skip through the rainforest
which I didn't even know was on my
bucket list but now that I did it I'm
glad I did plus we got to see a
waterfall in real life Wow
so majestic but the biggest dream come
true what's visiting the zoo well I call
it koala I got to see every single
animal I ever dreamed up and I got to
say hi to all of them
hello Crocs hi hello
hi little Lizzy oh my god hi hey
goodness you're so pretty
hi honey
here's my childhood favorite he's so
majestic and sweet oh my god I know I
would fall in love with fluffy haired
Australian boy I didn't know he'd have
four legs but I mean okay I've got picky
hello your little Gengar kookaburra sit
in an old gum tree the best thing I've
ever seen wait please be enough ooh hoo
look at this extra chicken oh my god I
love it and I lived my dream of holding
a koala this is the greatest moment of
my life I literally could cry watching
this video
oh yes my child Tinkerbell the acrylic
claws are hereditary by the way that's
why we both have them
what else we do well we ate a ton of
food we ate fancy tea with the most
beautiful view I've ever seen like oh my
god are you serious
someone put that on a post garden I eat
dessert at night dessert in the morning
I got two dinners because I'm fat fancy
Italian food casual healthy food food
with a fancy view of food with a beach
view even food with a rainforest view
featuring Bailey dancing go Bailey we
even saw a vending machine full of
champagne and if that's not a big mood I
don't know what is oh my gosh look at
this came to rueful a crocodile fillet
uh-huh I get so much I practically had
to be rolled out of Australia it
probably gained 35,000 pounds but it was
all worth it we even tried the local
cuisine all right guys we got some
Vegemite to try for the first time so
ready try some Vegemite let me think
here we go all righty okay we don't have
spoon some reason stirrers cheese okay
oh so what did we think should I say the
screenshot says it all we know we like
these five more ridiculous outfits that
made no sense for the activities we were
doing I mean I think this is scuba
diving appropriate constructor didn't
think so but I say why not
tourists wear casual wear bitch wear
sunglasses are like stuck on my head
fancy shopping where I bought it off
everything's a look if you want it to be
and my personal favorite my zoo wear and
of course I shopped a lot I have to make
an entire separate vlog of just me
shopping so stay tuned for that and of
course you can't go to Australia I do
not see the Great Barrier Reef so we did
some Vogue snorkeling oh my god we've
never looked better

what is so I've heard but what are we go

goodness how cute are they I even saw a
shark I didn't film that because I was
practically peeing my pants terrified
but I did see one and the turtle can you
