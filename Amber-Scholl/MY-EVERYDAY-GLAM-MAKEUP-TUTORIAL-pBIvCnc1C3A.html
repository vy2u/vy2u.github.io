I haven't seen you in 100 million years
even though it's been like a day so
what's up guys it's amber welcome back
to my channel and if you're new hello
greetings welcome to my bedroom so today
I'm going to be doing the
much-anticipated sequel to
unprofessional tutorials and I'm going
to show you guys my everyday makeup
routine because you guys asked not
because I really think anyone should
follow it but here we go my glam slash
everyday makeup routine unprofessional
tutorial style this is their face to me
so we're gonna go ahead and start like
this on a nice blank canvas
whoo so unflattering okay so when do I
start out with first is some primer this
is dr brandt pores no more pore refining
primary well just go ahead squirt that
all over my face da da da da put it
everywhere covered as it excellente and
then i just go ahead and rub that in hmm
hmm yes I use my fingers for this part
why not I don't know whatever well my
face is all primed up I'll go ahead and
use my foundation i foundation and
makeup forever
I'm HD stick from Sephora in beige is
like a stick now go ahead and rub that
all over my face not mm-hmm yeah there's
no method to madness here it's just you
know whatever and I'll just go ahead and
Pat that in with a damp Beauty Blender
oh how how beauty guru of me a damp
Beauty Blender boom boom perfect
all righty so now that I'm all
foundation up I'll go ahead and use some
concealer this is from Wet n Wild it was
like $2 at CBS and I'll just go ahead
and use that under my eyes to put it on
my desk to you know try to cover them up
I know it's gonna work and then I just
go ahead and Beautyblender it up I know
that's not a verb but whatever now to
contour my face because I do contour my
face everyday I'll use this darkest
shade in what is this is the Velvet 59
contour palette so I will go ahead and
get my fan base before a gold brush my
mom copy the most beautiful brush but
for Christmas it's like so beautiful
look at this look I'm going to do like
a little panawe - it's too pretty Brook
floating okay so I was just go ahead and
take this little flat brush look at
thing and I will dip it in D darkest
contour mm hmm hmm
so I'll just go ahead and put it on my
cheeks put it on my forehead put it a
little bit on my nose to chin I don't
know who knows I'll also put it on my
nose because it's like a DIY no job
super easy
go ahead blend that in with my fingers
but uh then I'll go ahead blend it all
in blend blend blend until it looks
blended yeah boo boo
all right so once I blended it all
together I'll go ahead and take my
powder which is really dirty ugly gleam
on off his Laura Mercier powder in
number 13 I picked it because it was
close to my skin tone and it was my
lucky number so I don't really recommend
picking your foundation like that but
hey if you're me if that's what you do
so I'll go ahead and just dip a big
fluffy brush in this um it's like it
says Laura Mercier powder and dip it
around blah and I know that's already
foundation eyes brush which is not a
work into the NARS powder which is also
really dirty I should clean things
before I do make a tutorial Boop anyways
so any of it is just like a right
translucent powder I will dip the brush
in mates to swirl it around you can see
all the powder flying that's my face and
then I'll just go ahead and fluff that
all around my face um again no real
rhyme or reason to this just kind of
fluffing it around until I feel like my
whole face is powdered mm-hmm
this is weird I'll take this little
powder this is L'Oreal True Match color
cocoa it's another like dark brown
powder I'll just set that on set the
bronzer with that with this little
bronzing brush um I'll just kind of put
the brown powder all over the darker
contour you shadowy areas of my face
until it looks good ish alright now that
we're all kind of powdered up I do
everything so out of order but we're
going to finish the contouring with you
before and that's what I'm doing my
makeup this is my filthy glow kit of I
am obsessed which is my favorite color
of course is Amber gold because my name
and it's totally named after me me and
out of start they're very close um not
really but she doesn't know like this so
then I'll just go ahead and get my
brushes in the glow can and I go
crazy with a highlighter I just love it
I think it's the best as dr. Seuss once
said highlighter here highlighter there
highlighter everywhere yeah that's the
new book that hasn't been released yet
but I'll put it on my nose the tip of my
nose I'll put it on my cheeks I'll put
it on my collarbones I'll put it
everywhere I mean you know the more the
merrier when it comes to highlight so
whoa but you popping now comes my
eyeballs so I think it's time to
inclusive whoo has this for a creepy
close-up okay so I don't take my Urban
Decay eyeshadow primer I get the
anti-aging one because you know why not
I just put it all over my eyelids this
looks so creepy but I mean okay and then
I will go ahead and put the highlighter
with a little fluffy brush like this on
the inner corner of my eye and then
underneath my eyebrow okay so for
eyeshadow I have been wearing these same
eyeshadow for years this is from the
first day I ever bought makeup I think
this is like vintage rare I don't even
know I got this one I was like 14
but these are my beautiful Mac
eyeshadows that I take immaculate care
of great colors natural colors darken
them up for night lighten them up for
day look great the whole time so take
the whole brush put that in here I will
go ahead and use brulee first you can
barely see it but I swear it makes a
difference in real life then I will go
ahead and take the darker shade espresso
and I will put it on the outer corner
kind of fading it up into the crease
again not really anything in particular
but I'm going for here I'm just doing
what I've done for years I also like to
put it on the bottom there we go makes
your eyes a little more circling there's
really no reasoning to any of my makeup
I just this is how I've always done it
and this is how I'm going to show you
that I do it
so for eyeliner i will use Kat Von D
tattoo liner it's the best and then
Makeup Forever aqua XL pencil I got this
from Sephora you can see it's brand new
I still have like the plastic on it but
I will just go ahead take the liquid one
first to put it on the inner corner kind
of wing it out on the corners there to
make it nice and thick and dark if you
want a few full tutorial on this I have
one on my channel I linked it below then
I will use the pencil in the waterline
it doesn't hurt it just makes you look
very evil no I'm just getting stuff to
make you look evil but I guess it kind
of does anyways whatever once I got
I wonder done I'll go ahead and put on
mascara I use literally two kinds of
mascara and doubled them up because I'm
a crazy person
go ahead put that on I know my eyelashes
felt I'd like no eyelashes put it on the
top and the bottom bottom is very
important I love to like quadruple layer
it because I just feel like bottom
eyelashes make your eyes look extra
pretty and who doesn't want to be extra
pretty okay so yeah lots of talk about
my eyebrows all the time in my everyday
makeup tutorial last time I literally
want to cry looking at way like this is
so funny well glad that phase in my life
is over so my dear our Deen is I will
still pay sauce BFF alleles dip brow and
powder and use one of these little mini
brushes like fix I'll just go ahead and
just a little brush right into the gel
and the powder and I still am in until
how I wish they would naturally be when
I wake up but you know we can't all be
that lucky so then I will also go ahead
and take my NYX brow gel in the darkest
color they sell I don't know if it
really does much like who's ever heard
of your eyebrows flying away but I use
it anyway just in case they do decide to
fly away now they're all gels perfectly
in place maybe I'll just leave it like
this it looks great no I'm kidding okay
alrighty so there we go now that I got
my brows in place I'm just gonna go
ahead and do my lashes so for last today
I'm going to go ahead and use black
magic lashes these are my favorite
brands this particular style is called
Luminara I don't like to cut mine into
pieces just because it's easier for me
to glue them on I'll do a full eye lash
tutorial soon but that is what I do on
nose then I'll just glue them on piece
by piece but a big bada boom until they
stick and fluffy in my signature
overdone way alright so now that I got
my signature crazy eyelashes on I'm just
going to go ahead and use some blush
this brand new I've never actually used
it but I'm going to try it today and the
verdict is I actually like it cheap and
cute great alrighty this is the biggest
question I get this all the time what
lip color am I always wearing I wear the
same color every day this is NYX lip
liner and mob so what I do for this is I
will just over line my lips because I
like my lips to look humongous even
though they're totally not so I will
just go ahead and scribble on the color
all over until it kind of gives them a
very natural glow if I mess up at all
I'll go ahead and take this wet and wild
nude pencil because I live for the thing
I used it on my eyeliner earlier and I
also use it to touch up my lips just to
make them look extra perfectly shaped
it's ready for kissing in the gram okay
to finish off my look I will go ahead
and use Urban Decay oil control setting
spray I swear by this stuff it's the
bomb and I'll just spray it all over my
face mmm
and tada this is my finished makeup look
as you can see I had a lot of struggles
trying to film this it's harder than it
looks I swear I'm trying really hard but
there you go you can see my finale grand
look of what I look like on a daily
basis and in all of my videos so yeah so

how I do my face everyday um I know it's
