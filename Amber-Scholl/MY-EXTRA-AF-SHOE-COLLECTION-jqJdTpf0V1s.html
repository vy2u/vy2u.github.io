welcome back to my channel so today um
so many of you guys asked about my shoe
collection from my last video that I
figured uh hey can't believe anyone
would want to watch a video with me
trying on my own shoes but since you
guys wanted to see them I thought I
would show you guys all of my most
artfully decorated fabulous favorite
pairs of shoes I got to tell you a
secret though this is not actually all
my shoes this is all be like order them
so here we go the best ship in the world
mine oh alright you guys so this is a
pair of shoes that we're gonna start out
with just because this is my favorite
pair of shoes that I own oh my god
unbelievable so I love shoes that are
crystalline I love shoes that look like
art I got these off a site called tied
by um or TB dress I forget which one but
they're like the same website and they
were $99 but they are unbelievable like
they literally look like they cost a
hundred thousand billion dollars um you
can see like all the crystal detailing
and it's just gorgeous I think comes in
a few different colors too so that's
just it's like it's just wild I love
shoes that are wild because you know
life's short why not wear crazy freakin
shoe so oh wow there's that one Stunna
Stena alrighty so again on the bedazzled
shoe train oh my god I got these out the
same website I just thought they were so
beautiful with the crystals on them in
case you can't tell I love sparkly shoes
so these are super great I think they
also came in red but I liked the gold
pair personally because again like I
said I was kind of looking for stuff to
decorate my apartment with and they're
just wow oh my god you guys I'm like
gonna cry looking at all of my shoes
like this they look so beautiful and
these were cheaper too I think these
were like $60 but again I mean if you
bought these at Nordstrom they'd be like
8000 so kind of a steal in a weird way
alright so I got so many questions about
these these are directives of the
Giuseppe Zanotti shoes from like two
seasons ago but there is still just as
beautiful as ever I got them in the
silver metallic color because I don't
know I actually don't really have any
silver shoes you can see they're like
really tall but soit but pretty
nonetheless I don't know I just like
really really love these shoes
probably has something to do with the
fact that I saw Kim wearing them once
but you know who knows alright so this
is my other pair you might recognize
these from my Instagram I literally love
these gold booties they're also actually
a dupe of Giuseppe Zanotti and I am
obsessed with them um they're just like
oh where do you get gold caged booties I
just whoo I could look at these for the
rest of my life
honest to god just stunning stunning
shoes I love them Wow
honestly I'm getting way too excited
about this okay so we're just gonna
we're gonna move on before I like
explode looking at these so these are my
little Christmas Eve shoes if you
recognize them from snapchat I thought
these were just adorable these are a
dupe of Charlotte Olympia um they have
like little red satin bows on the side I
just thought were super cute definitely
super extra and over the top especially
on your feet like I mean you know they
look like little princess bows though
but they're so cute I just thought they
were bangin shoes not something I'd ever
seen before which is why I nabbed those
again off the same like Chinese random
website that I got them from
okay so following the Charlotte Olympia
trend these are those butterfly sandals
I died when I saw these online so cute I
actually got these on eBay I believe for
like $39 or something crazy so so cute
you can see they have little angel wings
I mean actually they're technically
butterfly wings but I thought they look
like angel wings which is why I got them
cuz you guys are my little angels so I
thought that was like you know cute fun
anyways you can see they look so cute
it's just really unique again not
something I'd ever really seen an issue
before so I thought they were fun and
not to mention um the price was like so
bang and I couldn't help myself I
actually ordered them in two colors a
gold and silver so there you go those
are my little angel butterfly sandals
heyyo okay so I've actually instagrams
these twice at this point but I love
these booties they're rose gold booties
from public desire which is a great
website I shop there all the time it's
not a sketch like website at all this
one is actually super legit and easy to
shop on so um that is uh where I got
bees from super nice I just thought they
were like really cool because metallic
is super in and so are booties and I was
just like damn these are a great
addition to my shoe collection I don't
know if you heard that but my stomach
just growled so that was really awkward
but hopefully you didn't hear that um so
there we go oh so cute so cute all right
say hello to Jimmy two flower dupes um
so these are a pair of Jimmy Choo heels
that were super popular they were like 2
grand and I'd always had my eye on them
just because they were so unique and so
when I found this dupe again on a
Chinese website uh I thought they were
so fun like little silver heels I guess
I mentioned before that I didn't have
too many silver heels but guess what I
guess I actually have two pairs but
they're so cool they had the little
flowers on them and again I just thought
they were like a little piece of art
which um it's kind of what I was going
for with this particular shoe collection
that I wanted to display on my shelf is
things that are a little more over the
top than even my regular
over-the-topness these make me want to
click my heels like Dorothy for some
reason click click click take me home
no actually take me to shoe heaven
inherence ok anyways ok so again unlike
the 70s porn star kind of look I am so
into these right now this patent leather
bootie I've been talking about them I
already showed another pair but ooh look
at these gold heels
white patent leather pointy toed so so
cute they kind of have an easy vibe they
kind of are tight on your thigh too
which is nice
and they go up at an angle and I've worn
them so many times and get so many
compliments on them again have
instagrammed them a few times so so cute
die oh love love love love and last but
not least also on the EZ train where I
show these off in my New Year's Eve
video actually but these are from
misguided my favorite website oh I just
love this I know I have a million
favorite websites but this one really
truly is like up there in my tops but
they're a dupe of the Yeezy season 2
sandal that the Kardashians Chrissy
Teigen ggd literally everyone's been
wearing these lately they're so cute
they just make your legs look a little
longer and are so nude and like have the
trendy clear heel by the way you guys no
one paid me to make this video I just
wanted to show off my shoe collection I
guess some of the UM were sent to me by
the companies in the past after I begged
them to send them to me if I put them in
a video so uh oh yeah I've ordered off
all these sites multiple times but I
think I'm supposed to put a disclaimer
in there so here you go disclaimer some
of these shoes were sent me that's a one
of the parks of putting our shoes on
YouTube is sometimes people will send
you shoes to put on YouTube so they have
you guys I hope you guys enjoyed the
video I hope you moved the shoes as much
as I do because honestly filming this I
was like oh look anyways thanks so much

questions comments concerns all my
socials are at amber shoal so hit me up
on there by the way you guys yes I love
shoes but not even half as much as I
love you guys and trust me that is
