back to my channel so today I'm going to
be doing a very exciting video where I
tell you all of the dirty little secrets
behind my hair because it is a very much
talked-about question um you may know if
you know me that I actually have short
hair but this is the best hair extension
products on the market today I'm going
to show you with the help of my favs
hidden crown hair extension um how I do
my hair and what I sent your products I
use so actually all right that it tada
oh I never do this but tada this is what
my hair actually looks like as you can
see there's literally nothing wrong with
it umm it's cute short actually it's
really trendy right now but uh I
personally like my hair to be like
pornstar long umm so that's why I wear
extensions if you like your hair and
long why don't you just grow it out I
have it on my haircut since freshman
year of high school and let me tell you
I just don't think my hair is going to
get any longer but I wear extensions let
me show you alright so here we go this
is it so now look at the cute little
container they just sent me this is the
best hair extender onyx on the market
this is hidden crown hair extensions
I've been wearing these for maybe about
five years now actually and I am
obsessed and let me just tell you guys
I've been wearing extensions forever
ever ever ever I've had every product
that you can ever imagine I had this so
in ones I had the gluon ones I had the
tape and once I had the permanent ones
with the little bonded beads I've had
clip ins for years and the one thing
that has been my saving grace has been
these guys because it is the easiest
product I've ever had and it's also the
best-looking and the most uh sort of
financially responsible product so I'm
going to show you how I find it and how
they work so let's get started so here
we go these the actual extensions tada
this is what they look like when you
take him out of the package you can see
the quality on these is beautiful oh
it's so shiny and the light just like my
highlight oh yeah hell yeah okay um but
yeah it's really great hair it's super
thick and dense it's not like the clip
in extensions which always irritated me
because it's like that's 10s little left
of hair it's like girl I'm trying to
make my hair long and thick why are you
sending me like niblets of hair alright
so as you can see it's kind of taped in
pretty good so I'm just gonna um cut
that out
boom boom fabulous yeah it's free
alright so as you can see it's just one
giant piece of hair which is awesome
because it's so easy to put on and off
but here if I bring it a little closer
you can kind of see what I'm more
talking about it's one weft as opposed
to like a bunch of them that you have to
clip in there's no clips as you can see
so I'll show you how you put that in in
a second but um it's a bunch of
different layers of hair all
individually sewn together into one a
giant fabulous luscious little piece
whew I'm so excited to wear this I love
it when I have you here okay and here's
all you have to do to put this on is
literally the easiest thing in the world
um once you buy it brand new you'll see
this drain you have to adjust the string
to see what size fits your head properly
so you can adjust it and pull on it to
see how you want it to rest on your head
perfectly obviously you don't want it to
be like hanging off so you want to make
it tight enough that it stays then you
will just adjust that appropriately and
then where's my little hmm I'm such a
professional you'll grab little cuticle
scissors once you adjust it and now
you'll just clip off a string right
where you decided was the good leg so
let's see
OOP there we go fabulous
all right so now you have your little
custom fitted crown all you got to do
literally putting it on takes one second
check this out
loop rest the wire on your head
and that's it literally that's all you
do then
they actually usually won't send you a
little comb I managed to lose mine
because find the slob but here is you
can also buy a little teaser comb all
you really need is the bristles at the
end because that is what is easy to pull
your hair through so once you do that
once you rest it on your head like so
this is all you got to do kind of pull
the hair out from underneath the wire
and pull it on top and do that all over
your head so as you can see the wire is
sitting over here but on this side now
you can't see it and on this side you
totally still can so we will just do
this time to this is very hard to film
kind of like feeling like I'm in Greece
chasing my hair all right there you go
make sure you get the back too you can
do with your fingers too especially if
you have long nails like me mmm
all right
ah you're done that's all you do yes and
now you have a luxurious hair like oh my
God look ah mm-hmm just how I like it
okay so a little frequently asked
questions people always ask me can you
call me you brush it what do you do
since I'm a diva I use this like diamond
D brush to brush it but you can use
anything that you want it's 100% real
human hair and the highest quality on
the market - as you can see it's just
like oh damn shiny Wow I just love I can
cut it if you want it to match a certain
style I actually usually color mine -
because I color my own hair at home I
will make another video about that later
um so I will dye it to match the same
color as my hair though as you can see
right now it totally matches because
I've not dyed my hair in a little bit um
so yeah you can cut it color and do
whatever you want straighten it curl it
it's your hair girl so do whatever you
want to do now the question that I get
asked more than anything this is not
secured to your head is it gonna fall
off no it's not I don't know what kind
of science for what kind of physics it
is but something if you have put this on
right this will stay all day you can tug
on it like you could tug on it okay
nothing's gonna happen you can flip your
hair upside down so I decide whew like
can you see this is not um this is a
very weird thing to be filming but it's
not budging it's not going anywhere it
will not fall off so don't worry about
that he's not going anywhere
not worried okay so what's it like to
take care of this thing none really it's
the most low-maintenance hair product
you will ever have um boys I can you
brush it yes I'm a diva so I brush it
with this like diamond D brush thing but
you can use any brush any comb it's just
like real hair so feel free well it's
not just like real hair it literally is
real human hair and the highest quality
of the market mind you so as you can see
it's very soft and luscious and just wow
it is just the best product that I've
ever used I loved it so much and I would
not be making this video and telling you
guys about it if I didn't really
genuinely love it this is the hair that
I've been wearing for ever and it is
honest to god changed my life I know
that sounds
like Elaine and shallow but really I'm
having beautiful hair is restoring one
of my confidence um and it just makes me
feel so pretty to have long luscious
hair alright so actually a little bit
more about the hair too um it is 100%
human hair the highest quality on the
market as you can see it's so shiny as
beautiful I just ah oh my god I just
adore it
um but this is like I said this is the
20 inch length so it is long
let me see you can see it comes down to
a little bit right below well a few
inches below my chest but the 20 inches
is my personal favorite it also comes
and I believe 16 and 14 though I will
check on that and include the correct
size comes in here alright now also um a
little TMI tips this is the only
extension that I've ever had like I said
I've had every kind that existed on the
market I got the glue end the sew ins
the tape in the literally everything and
this is the only product I've ever had
the boys can't feel or girls can't feel
whatever suits your fancy but when
you're running your fingers through it
it literally is completely hidden um let
me see if I can show you this from what
it looks like underneath um but yeah you
can't can you see this you can't see it
at all in real life but it's if it's
just one little thin piece and it blends
in with your hair so well that you
literally can't feel it it's so soft
it's not like the clip ends where you'll
be like oh yeah touch my hair and it
likes me
no this is great because it's so soft
and so smooth you can totally you can
still run your fingers through it you
can do literally anything that you want
to do um and it is just completely
seamless more frequently asked questions
can you wear it in a ponytail can you do
style yes absolutely
um for a ponytail look literally just
pull it up and put a tie in it
turn off I don't feel like doing that
because it looks so great down but you
most definitely can how do you clean it
um literally I will wash mine probably
about once a month depending on how many
days I wear it um
I wear mine every single day my juice
it will last if you wear it every day
and straighten it every day like I do
usually they last me about six months
however if you don't wear it every day
and if you take really good care of it
these unless I've had some that lasts up
to two years so it's all depending on
how you take care of it but ya wash it
once a month I literally will just take
it off my head and put shampoo and
conditioner on it and then lay it flat
to dry you can blow dry if you want I
have been known to do that or you can
like I said you can straighten it and
you can do whatever you want to it so
because of hair and it's your hair so
however you would treat your normal hair
treat it like this if you're worried
about finding your perfect color match
whatever yes like I said you can feel
free to diet they also have so many
colors that you'll be good to go my item
specifics I suppose this is like I said
earlier to beginning a video this is the
20 inches in color 1b which is kind of
on/off black but you can test and see on
the website which color that you want or
once order it you don't even have to
worry if you ordered the wrong size you
can make returns and exchanges and they
will even send you a little color
swatches of the shade lighter than the
one that you picked and the shade darker
than the one that you picked so you can
see if that is in fact exactly what you
wanted to get so no worries on that
they're very very helpful in
accommodating and last thing of course
the dreaded question how much these cost
oh but first thought before I'd say how
much they do let me just preface this
with when I had all the other extensions
I spent probably thousands of dollars on
my hair like when I got the permanent
ones it was two thousand dollars and
they only lasted for like four months
so this is definitely a better bargain
of the ones that I get are twenty inches
and they are $2.99 that's the most
expensive ones that they have and also
you get the 16 inches they're 275 and
then the 12 inches is 250 so they are a
little bit on the pricey side I know
especially if you're on a budget trust
me guys I get it I'm always like trying
to pinch pennies wherever I can but this
is a splurge that is absolutely worth it
it is the best hair extension product
that I've ever used and I mean it just
doesn't lie it's the best so I hope that
this will help you guys out because
I was looking for something like this
for years and years and years until I
found it so I hope that maybe I can help
you enjoy your hair a little bit more
and improve your daily quality of life
and if that isn't worth it I don't know
what is are you guys there you have it
that is all of the secrets behind my
hair extensions
if you've any more questions that I
didn't answer feel free to comment below
and I will always respond um or if you
want to say hey on any other social
media platform um all of my socials are
at Amber shoal so feel free to a chat
with me there um yeah I guess that's it
I love you good luck with your fabulous
hair journey I'm gonna go rock this out
on the town Oh your sleigh honey okay um
