back to my channel so I don't know why I
have my arm flailing in the air like
that anyways so today you can probably
tell by the bang and lighting and the
really new fancy background this is
actually not my house
um but I am in like a professional
makeup studio shindig look at this
woohoo thumbs if on say so today um I'm
going to show you guys how I do my cat
eye eyeliner because I always get so
many questions about it and despite the
fact that I am NOT a makeup artist or a
professional in any sense of the word
literally at all um I thought I would
start a series called unprofessional
makeup tutorials because you guys keep
asking so there's my arm flailing again
what the heck anyways here we go how I
do my cat eye eyeliner first things
first my favorite liner of all time ever
in the world is Kat Von D's tattoo liner
I would use again for like 15 years so I
will just take the liner and starting in
the inner lashline I just kind of draw a
straight line down towards the tear duct
area and then I will just over extend it
so you can see I'm drawing it a little
bit past um where my little eyeball
thing ends then I will go ahead and kind
of repeat the same process drawing a
little mini triangle but this time
starting at the bottom of the point and
going back towards into my eyes so you
can see looks like a little triangle and
then I'll just kind of scribble that in
don't worry about it being perfect we
are going to adjust it later tada there
we go good enough okay so then I'm just
gonna go ahead and draw on the top liner
as you would see I'm not that great at
this uh and I'm not really even sure how
to film it like I accidentally put my
hand in the middle of the frame so sorry
about that but again just kind of draw
on your top liner as you usually would
this is how I do it it's just kind of a
mess but you know gets the job done then
we're going to do the outer wing now
what I like to do is start kind of
outwards and draw the line in so you can
see I just draw a little baby line like
that and then I will draw a little top
line again like a little mini triangle
you can see mine is not perfect but
again just color it in
gonna fix it all later so just kind of
get the base shape of what you're
looking for you can do it thicker
thinner depending on what kind of style
you like and then we will go ahead and
adjust it so here we go you can see just
gonna draw that in a little bit more
thicken up the line make it look fab so
the next thing that we're going to need
this is what's going to change your
eyeliner game forever this is wet and
wild it's just a nude pencil and look at
this
this thing is above balm I don't know
what this is actually for but this is
what I use it for so you can see if you
just kind of draw it on its basically
acts as an eraser for your liner that
you messed up so you can see I'm just
going to go ahead and sharpen the line
with this by drawing it at the bottom
here and making it look just extra extra
fleeky by them look at that and then
I'll go ahead and repeat the process on
the inside too I'm just kind of coloring
at the bottom and on the top making sure
it looks extra pointy and like I
artfully did it correctly the first time
even though I totally did not all righty
so the next product I use is that makeup
forever
eyeliner pencil um yeah I know it's the
mini version because I'm cheap and they
gave this to me for free for my birthday
so that's why like you sit thanks
Sephora so then I will just go ahead and
lie me in her um waterline of my eye I
always used to watch my mom do this when
I was younger and I thought it would
hurt so bad and like stab you but
actually you don't feel it so I just
kind of color metal in to create the
full effect of darkness that sounded
creepy okay anyways said I will go ahead
and put on top and bottom mascara bottom
mascara is like a game changer you guys
like always use it then I'll go ahead
and glue on my falsies look and fab oh
yes tada there we go we're done we're
only gonna do that one looks great no
I'm totally kidding we'll go ahead and
glue on the rest of them um and then we
will look flaky as hell
look at this ah beautiful for someone
who has no idea what they're doing I
think this came out pretty good so there
you have you guys that is how I create
my signature cat eye winged inner corner
liner fleeky god I don't even know what
you would call this but I hope you
enjoyed the tutorial as always if you
have any questions comments concerns all
bye socials are at amber shoal and yes
by the way I did totally forget to film
an outro which is why I'm doing it like
this so hope you guys enjoyed as always
