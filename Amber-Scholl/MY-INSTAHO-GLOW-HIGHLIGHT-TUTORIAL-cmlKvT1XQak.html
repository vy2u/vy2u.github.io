Disney Channel I totally get in but it
is amber and you are watching my youtube
channel so what's up guys welcome back
and if you're new hello greetings
welcome to my bedroom so today I thought
it'd be fun to go ahead and show you
guys my pup and highlight routine
because I always get so many questions
about it on Instagram and on here so
please bear in mind I am NOT a
professional makeup artist nor do I
actually know what I'm doing I am no
beauty guru and never claimed to be but
said you asked without further ado but
super quick really easy version of how I
get that insta ho
golden glow
all righty yeah so this is a with no
highlight on so weird I literally feel
like it's not even me without my glow so
we're just going to get right to it with
my honest hacia glow
kit you can say comes with lots of
colors amber gold is my favorite because
it's the best stuff next thing you're
going to need is three different size
brushes I have this one fluffy brush
from NYX super teeth but just like
fluffy going to use that for my teeth
then I also have this flat top brush
which I use for the bridge of my nose
and then finally I have this little
itty-bitty mini fluffy brush and I use
that 4d tip of my nose so my biggest tip
is before you use the brushes go ahead
and spray them with setting spray this
is just going to make the highlight go
on super smooth and give it that extra
metallic glow so there we go
secret hack I usually like to start with
my nose so I will just take the flat top
brush and dip it into the highlight and
then I will go ahead and put it right on
the bridge of my nose just like this not
rocket science guys literally super easy
I just kind of highlight the bridge of
my nose stopping just a little bit
before the tip then for the tip of the
nose I will go ahead and take the little
mini fluffy brush and dip that on in
there and then I will put that right on
the very tip of my nose just like that
so it glows and makes it look a little
tinier and a little cuter DIY nose job
anyone alright getting weird anyways it
just makes it look so cute in little and
like a little bunny rabbit okay any
movie now we're going to go ahead and
use at the top of the brush again for my
lips so what I like to do here is kind
of put it right there I don't know what
part of your body that is called but I
put it there and then I put highlight on
the top of my lip because that makes
them look fuller and bigger when it
catches the sunlight this is totally
messing up my lipstick right now but you
get the points bada bing bada boom
fabulous then of course the most fun
part my cheekbones more than where
you're really heavy-handed so get up in
there no I'm kidding kind of anyways the
point of highlighter is to kind of have
it reflect where the Sun would naturally
kiss your skin so look into the sign to
see where the highlighter is supposed to
go it's usually on the tip of your
cheekbones so then just go ahead and put
it right on there super simple super
easy super glowy
bippity boppity boop look fabulous and
last but not least just because I'm
super extra I will go ahead and
highlight my collarbones I don't know
why not so I'll just go ahead and slip
that right on there with a big fluffy
brush again glistening up a glowy
perfection
everything's all highlighted up just to
set everything in place I will go ahead
and use the little setting spray again
and spray my whole face a couple of
sprays I don't know this stuff is kind
of expensive so I don't usually do too
many sprays but there we go
pin it on into your skin and but uh
fabulous honey oh my goodness the
highlight is popping your top and
everything is popping we're having the
greatest day of my life I don't know how
to show this off just going to be kind
of weird and there we go
anything's me so there you have it you
guys that is how I do my highlight um I
hope you guys liked the video even
though I mean it was a little bit of a
mess but there it is as always if you
have any questions comments concerns Oh
my socials are amber Scholl so you can
hit me up on there I love talking to you
guys and um I feel like there's more
things that I should say but I'm trying
a blank you can't think of any of them

channel for a lot more silly
unprofessional nonsense and I will see
you guys next time I love you so very
much my sweet baby angels kisses till
