her hi guys what's up it's amber welcome
back to my channel sorry that was such a
weird intro anyways so you might have
been asking for me to do a little hair
tutorial video because I do always wear
my hair pretty much the same and it's
always pin straight and it always has a
middle part so today I just wanted to
show you guys my little Kim Kardashian
inspired hair routine mind you like I
said this is completely unprofessional I
know nothing about hair actually but I
got to be fun just to show you really
quick how I do it so here we go how I do
my Kim K hair to get started on this
video I just want to say quick shout out
to my friends over at sugar bear hair
thank you for sponsoring the video you
guys totally know what these are because
you see them literally all over
Instagram American Girl is expected so
people and asking me by actually pay
fees of course I do you guys you know I
would never like to let anything spawn
to me that I don't actually take so my
mini two second review is yes they're
freaking delicious and I actually
already took 3 this morning but I'm
going to take a few more um because
they're like candy and what is the whole
Sun I really don't know if it's safe to
eat this many a day but I emailed them
and they said I wasn't going to die so
anyways there we go
thanks for bear ok here we go so they're
getting the unprofessional tutorial with
a kind of an unprofessional start um I'm
just going to go ahead and take my weave
off because remember you don't know I
wear extensions so I'm just going to go
ahead remove those I get in the shower
and start from complete scratch so here
we go I never really thought I would
like to leave myself on camera but here
we go
boom oh yeah nice involved oh guys can
go ahead and hop in the shower and I'll
be right back boom alright
Lucia this is a look ok so as you can
see I just took a shower like two
seconds ago and so I'm just going to go
ahead I always part my hair when it's
wet because that's just for some reason
makes it easier it's like built-in like
hair gel or something so I want to take
this little comb it is actually the one
that comes with my hair extensions but
it's like a little teeny like cheese or
Coney and get them anywhere you can get
a Miss Sally's for like 99 cents I think
so I'm just going to go ahead and take
the comb and kind of brush it backwards
while it's wet like this tada and then I
will line up the comb with my nose like
this will be because your nose
in the center of your face so I would
just line that up like this and kind of
pull it backwards until I find what
seems like the middle part so it seems
like right about there ish and it looks
a little actually looks pretty good
then I was just kind of like perfected
make sure the little fuzzy is in the
front are okay
comb it with my comb mm-hmm I feel like
Rapunzel except the opposite of Rapunzel
because my hair is like short and wet
like a wet rat but here we go ma'am now
I pretty much found my middle part so
when I got the part and I like the way
that it looks I'm just going to go ahead
and blow-dry it this is my like blow
dryer I know it's like soap a key but I
have literally lasted for like 10 years
I don't even know I bought this so long
ago so shout out to this little hair
dryer for lasting so long as like so
ghetto but it's fantastic so they don't
depend on the IOC's setting and go ahead
and blow-dry my hair by the way when I
was drying my hair I like to hold the
blow-dryer super close to my head
because that kind of makes the part get
like blow-dried into place which I don't
know if that makes too much sense but
yeah that's just like a random little
tip saying there I was going over to
have fun when you're blow-drying your
hair you're a supermodel you're a
goddess you know dance around okay
anyways okay so then when my hair is dry
look wow I like really frizzled it to
death
there we go when my hair is dry then
I'll just go ahead and straighten it to
go along with my super fancy hair dryer
I have a super fancy straightener 1999
from CBS like again I don't know ten
years ago I think this was like
literally one of the only straighteners
I've ever owned in my lifetime I like it
because of that really big blades and it
just drains your hair like super quick
so I'm straightening my hair I like to
do it in sections just because it's
easier and makes it go a little faster
even though I've really been here and it
really doesn't take very long anyways
let's go ahead and pick up one of these
clamps and pull up half of it like this
boom it kinda has a flat iron in this
bottom layer I feel like I should tell a
story because it's part of the videos
boring so I don't really have these
stories but this weekend I went to a
party and I met a guy who literally
looked exactly like Phil of the future I
was like convinced that it was him so I
went up was like oh my gosh hi or Phil
of the future and he was like no
literally I'm not so in the future and I
died it was so embarrassing but I gave
him my number anyway but he did not call
me so that is the current love life
update to come
you know what can you do by the way by
just a random side tip when you're
straightening your hair don't just be
like madam Allah Allah if you take one
piece at a time and kind of hold it
there like do the one-mississippi
two-mississippi like that you learned in
elementary school then you only have to
do it once instead of like 18 times and
then I feel like that's better for your
hair even though I'm no haircare
professional but there's no totally
unprofessional hair straightening tips
uh for me all right so what's the little
bottom layer is straightened I'll just
go ahead and remove the clip from there
and then I will just go ahead and do the
top layer so nah
I know I know I should use heat
protectant blabbity blabbity blah but
whatever I don't care
there we go okay now my hair is straight
alright so for those of you who don't
know I'm your hair extensions I'm Eric
Jess job these are them on these are
called hidden crown hair extensions I've
been wearing these for like 5 plus years
and I've tried everything in the whole
world and this is my favorite because
it's like one piece it's just so freakin
easy um so anyways I have a whole video
on those if you want to see more on that
but I would just go ahead and slip my
extensions right on in by swapping them
on my head like that so and then I just
go ahead take the little comb and pull
the hair like so right on over the wire
so you can't see it does it um just kind
of like run my fingers through that like
this so you can't see the wire and great
okay so in fact I sent you there and
we're just going to go ahead and finish
it off so it looks perfectly Kim
Kardashian asked is that a word no but I
just made it one so alright another
thing when I'm doing my hair is I don't
just straighten it flat I kind of curl
the ends in like this so you can see it
kind of gives it a little bit more
dimension and my extensions go on for a
hundred million years but you can see I
do that to the ends there too because
these are like 100 percent human hair so
you just treat it exactly like you would
your regular hair you can straighten it
cut it color it whatever you want I do
all the above so yeah there we go you
can see it just kind of makes it fall a
little bit nicer on your chest
woo it's literally so unflattering oh my
god okay so let's go ahead and secure
the whole hairdo perfectly in place my
trick for keeping the part to look extra
perfectly flawless is I will take care
spray and instead of spraying it like
this because I don't like the way that
it feels I feel like it makes my hair
feel really crunchy and you know just
weird so this is what is this John
Frieda hairspray I got this again at
cbs2 like $0.99 I will go ahead and
spray it directly onto my hand like this
hmm like that that looks okay go ahead
rub it on your hands and then you can
put it directly onto your hair like this
to flatten it and make sure the part
stays perfectly flawlessly in place boom
boom boom boom yes bitch
and there we go that is how I get my
little mouth work boom boom boom and
there we go tada
just like him I mean not really but this
was the best but I could do so tada
Cleary on you guys that is how I do my
hair I know it's not the most exciting
thing in the world but I hope you at
least sort of enjoyed it as always if
you have any questions comments concerns
all my socials are at numbers also hit
me up on is there I love you guys so
very much thanks for caring about my
like bad tutorials I know I'm not a
beauty guru I never claimed to be one
but if you guys are asking um I figured
you know I would just try my best if so
I love you guys so very much I will see
you super soon wishing you guys good
hair days for the rest of your life get
this till next time my sweethearts XO
oh my god we've snatched I don't know
what's wrong with me today
