anyone else remember that show I feel
like I just probably aged myself like
300 years but anyways who is up you guys
in amber welcome back to my channel and
today for the very first time ever
welcome to I've been hinting at it for a
while now and a bunch of you guys
already guessed it but I haven't
announced it till now but yes the
special surprise that I've been talking
about is I am finally moving into my
dream apartment so it's a huge mess you
can tell by all the boxes in the back
homes I literally moved in yesterday so
nothing's really ready yet at all and
you know deal with that later but I just
wanted to give you guys a really quick
tour of my new place so without further
ado here we go a very extra new
apartment or excitement okay here we go
yeah but lighting in my hallway sucks I
wonder if I'd like turn around is that
gonna help
hmm oh yes much better side note I have
my Princess Jasmine here in today so fun
all right so we're gonna start with the
front door I literally was sold on this
place the second I saw this like oh my
god how extra side note my ring
collection ooh so beautiful all right
what an aesthetic no no Harry Styles
he's not gonna be up all the time I just
figured you know for the holidays this
is a really funny decoration so anyways
continuing the tool this is like the
little entering thing I'm gonna put a
chandelier up here but you can see this
is like the little grand foyer thing of
the apartment and look at this resource
to me this is the coolest part of the
whole place because you guys know I made
fake marble floors at my old place and
that was really what started my youtube
channel so anyways I'm gonna try not to
get too sentimental yet so next up then
we have ah what is this I don't even
remember
storage cabinet here nothing too
exciting then oh this is my outfit of
the day by the way oversized Victoria's
Secret sweater
cool lack leggings great okay so this is
the guest bathroom
woo there's so many of me hello and I
actually don't have cabinets yet the
cabinets are coming up Monday so for now
no cabinets but anyways I'll show you
something more exciting than the
bathroom
alright so this is the hallway which you
can see super fun I have like a bar
thing for no reason I don't even drink
but here we go I'm probably just gonna
put like my shoe collection on here I
don't know we'll see
so moving do it from zipper this is my
bedroom I'll show you that in a second
tada the rest of the house I'm gonna put
a chandelier here so it looks more
fabulous it's kind of just like a really
big open room which is what I wanted I
know I know
again ignore the giant piles of stuff
like half of these boxes are things I'm
gonna sell on Poshmark so stay tuned for
that like I said I haven't unpacked yet
so just go with that for now but it's
gonna be really pretty of those are all
cleaned up so all the giant boxes then
we have over here which is kind of like
they called it the den area but I'm
gonna film my lip books here
oh the first printing in my new
apartment yes honey
oh so this is just gonna meet my new
selfie station oh so fun so fun so you
can see out my window I'm actually super
high up like oh yes but we just won't
look out there it's scary so more stuff
and then you can see oh you can kind of
see it from a different angle it's
really really nice and big for one
person actually speaking of the view
we're gonna go over here look at this
open this up look at that
it's beautiful
we'll go back inside really quick cuz
like I said I'm a little afraid of
heights so hikes alright so moving on
from the beautiful window we can see my
kitchen which also has no cabinets on it
so just you know use your creative
imagination they're gonna be the same
color as this nice dark wood my granite
countertops we got the sink all these
fun things the real appliances and look
how cute this stuff is my mommy got me
these from my moves I'd read this and
share it with you guys but it already
made me cry last night and I don't want
to mess up my flaky eyeliner self we're
gonna pass for now but anyways there we
go oh my God look at this oh I know it's
kind of weird to be this excited about
appliances but I've literally never had
a fridge with a water bankfull this is
like such an exciting day for me because
I literally hated drinking out of a
Brita water filter things it was like so
annoying I always forgot to change the
filter and then it would be like black
and I was just drinking it would been
embarrassing to say on here probably so
I'm just gonna maybe all that I even
have a washer and dryer in my own house
Oh beautiful
so no more laundromat so that's the
kitchen and next stop on the tour is my
bedroom
okay so my bedroom isn't like done at
all because I have no furniture no
decorations but you can still see this
is kind of the generic vibe it's gonna
be white and black
I brought these from my old apartment
because I loved them I'm actually gonna
hang this up there but you can see I'm
gonna put a big bed over here for now I
just have my mattress whoa and then my
mom was actually staying here too so we
have the mattress on the floor but she's
out and about right now so I'll show her
later by the way
look at this do you guys know what this
is it's air-conditioned my last
apartment doesn't have air-conditioning
so I was always so sweaty in my videos
but now a dream come true
no more sweaty videos yay oh and outside
the window you can see I have this like
little patio thing which is super cute I
can go outside and like hang out I don't
really know what I'd be doing out there
but I could if I wanted so there we go
you can see the bedroom from kind of
like a different angle
dah dah dah dah and over here is the
good stuff are you ready for closet
heaven mm-hmm da da da da da nights so
big oh my god I'm gonna cry
so Biffen in my new closet it's so big
oh my god literally look at this I have
the clothing racks over here I've got a
giant shoe whatever shelf I'm gonna put
stuff over here I'm hanging stuff over
here I'm like honestly having a love
affair with my closet
believe it or not that was the shortened
version of the performance but anyways
so as you can tell I really need to
clean out my closet again so it's like
last time I'm teaming up with my
wonderful friends over at Poshmark again
and I'm gonna be listing all of my extra
fabulous clothes on there for you guys
to buy if you would like to twin with me
in case you guys missed my last Plaza
clean-out video Poshmark is just a super
cool app where I sell all of my old
clothes and shoes and all sorts of other
things like you can see I have some of
my subs stuff out here I'm gonna sell
all of this it's super easy to use you
can see my closet right here all you got
to do is snap a couple pics of your fav
things then just add some quick
descriptions like you can see here we
got the category we got the size the
Schulich brand the color the everything
in between so everyone knows exactly
what you're selling and then and there
you can see very hearts so you can shop
them buy them and it's all good to go I
don't know why I'm laying on the floor
now but you guys can comment like make
your own closets share your closets with
me so we can buy each other's things
it'll be great wallaby twins
my shoes are my babies I really just
want them all to go to a good home
so only stuff is up and lifted if you
guys want to shop my closet it's a free
app you can just download it with the
link below so thanks Poshmark you mom
keep in my closet clean so anyways we
should probably get off my closet floor
so exiting out of my closet no no no no
make a turn here oh I thought it was fun
to put the angel wings for you guys
because you know you guys are my angels
so I thought this was just a fun little
touch so then you can see here we've got
the actual bathroom again no cabinet
doors but you can see super pretty
burbles Oh
very similar vanity why they gave me two
vanities I really don't know but hey the
more the merrier um you can see a very
exciting toilet a very exciting shower
so shower routine part two might be
coming soon just for fun I don't know I
just really like this shower it's so
cool umm then you can see we have the
tub right here whoo I've actually never
had a tub before either so that's pretty
much my bathroom that's me got my closet
and all that stuff in the background and
that's basically my bedroom so one last
look at that here exit out of my bedroom
and that is basically the whole place
have you guys stop in my new place I
hope you guys enjoyed the tour don't
if you want to buy some black stuff my
Poshmark is linked below but of course
it wouldn't be my video without a sappy
ending so of course I just wanted to say
a huge huge thank you from the bottom of
steps of my heart because this would not
be possible

to you guys because because I know
people always say like Oh youtubers

success and um I just wanted to make a
promise to you guys but just because I
