back to my channel so today is a very
exciting day because tada I just got the
new iPhone 7 and I'm so excited I have
not tested it out at all yet so I
thought it'd be fun to just do a little
unboxing video with you guys and so we
can test it out together so here we go
my very own iphone 7 review alright so
here we go this is the box that it came
in it looks humongous comparatively to
the phone but let's see what's inside
its really what's been in every iPhone
box to date has been this little
thingamajigger I don't know what this
name is um these Oh actually wait hey
this is different okay so here's what
the crazy headphones look like I guess
um comes with that little headphone jack
Wow I don't really know how to do this
let's see if we open this what is this
gonna be like oh so they are normal
headphones what the heck I thought they
were detached oh maybe they are I don't
know ok let's fully open this so I can
see what I'm talking about here mm let's
see it's really hard to open this with
one hand so bear with me oh actually I'm
going to put this down for a second and
open it one-one second alright there we
go um so you can see they actually
aren't detached to like I thought they
were I guess they are actually attached
to the wire and let's see where's the
little thing except they don't have the
normal headphone jack they have this
wait a second
does that mean I just plug them straight
into this let's investigate that oMG
guys you literally can plug them right
into the phone um like that and I that
phones are working so I don't know what
all the fuss was about
maybe I well that I really don't know
what this is about oh this is for if you
want to put in other headphones okay so
guys here's the deal the verdict seems
to be headphones are normal they just
don't have the regular headphone jack
but if you want to use like your beats
by dre or whatever I have these but
these headphones just plug in with that
so that's great that was actually making
me worried so I didn't lose them yet
here we go literally look exactly like
your homes and you can just plug them in
to the bottom like so just not with the
normal headphone jack so cool actually
okay that's great news because that was
stressing me out a little bit as you can
see I've already put entangled my
headphones because that's just my life
but anyways continuing on what else is
up with this thing
alright so you can see it's very
aesthetically pleasing just like all the
iPhones have been in the past
I actually just noticed this the back
design appears to be a little different
too this one has all these ugly little
symbols this is my six I do and this is
my seven that doesn't have that so it
also doesn't have this little line so
there we go I prefer the seven for sure
even though it's not really that
different but there's that just for
comparison alright here we go so you can
see my six in my seven next to each
other they're actually the exact same
size with the exception of like the
corners are a little different I don't
really know how to explain that but um
mine since I just have a bumper on it it
actually fits on the six too so that's
really cool so my six and seven could
share the same case but if you have an
actual case it won't work but like I
said since mine's just a bumper it still
fits this is most beautiful bumper in
the world by the way I've always stayed
loving the diamond D aesthetic matches
my fingers anyways things that are
different about the 7 that I've noticed
in the last five minutes of screwing
around with this the home button is
different instead of just being able to
place your finger on it and like click
on it now instead of like actually
pressing down it just is kind of a
vibrating thing I don't know how to show
you guys that but see I'm not really
actually let's see if I get super close
you can't really tell them not actually
even pressing on it just kind of resting
my finger on it and it's doing the same
thing that the six used to do so
that's kind of cool the only thing that
also for me anyways is a big deal is the
camera so the cameras are definitely
different the six versus the seven you
can see way bigger and this is way
tinier so let's see if the quality is
actually any better I'll take some
selfies and show you guys the difference
alright here we go so pardon the fact
that these are both very ugly photos of
me ah no come back
um but you can see the quality
difference is pretty high actually um
this one when you zoom in kind of blurry
and oh dang it
hello guys well anyways this one you can
see is kind of blurry um this one is
crisp as hell you can see my eyelashes
and my eyes
so clearly the quality is insane the
coloring is a little different - I'm not
really sure why but I guess it's
probably just the quality of the camera
so I'll throw those of those pictures up
in full res right now so you can look at
them and there you see ya the quality is
just pretty different so very
interesting all right so we're totally
going to like double entendre here with
video you can see the quality of this
video camera whoa is honestly almost as
good as my current video camera that I'm
using right now and that is a like
full-fledged point-and-shoot like 700
our camera so this actually works
amazing um yeah Wow maybe I'll film on
my phone more often so there we go
texting sounds different listen and the
backspace key makes a different noise
I'm one of those people who likes to
keep my phone on loud so that actually
is really a soothing sound I really like
it so nice okay I could probably play
some kind of like musical instrument
with this
it's fog some piano ballad learn how to
play Mozart anyways on my keyboard um
forget about that so let's see what else
um but uh I'm pretty sure this is just
an iOS 10 thing but the emojis now look
different here they are they're looking
a little Android II to me I'm not really
what the okay I just messed that up and
they're looking a little Android II to
me to under so I'm not really loving it
um but I mean you know cool I guess um
what else can we do I don't know what
any of this does actually I haven't even
messed with this yet what's this okay so
I don't really know what I'm doing it oh
what the
ah whoa what's that huh oh my god this
is so cool okay so I don't know what
that is but that's really cool let me
try and master this really lik like you
can draw text messages now like oh this
is very well that's ugly but that's fine
check it out ah I just sent that to my
sister oh my god a little ugliest art
ever in the world okay so I'm not much
for art but you know you get the point
alright so let's see in other news Siri
Siri hello oh okay so I still don't
really know how to use Siri where is she
how does she wait hey Siri sorry
oh god okay so this still doesn't work
um
Siri Siri what Siri I gonna go god okay
so Siri is still not my favorite
function sucks so bad with technology
this is hilarious okay um yeah so let's
try this again
Siri how are you what oh wow this is
what I ended up saying hey Siri I gun
okay so he's still at work Siri Siri I
got a favorite fun sucks so bad
Wow okay moving along what the I really
don't know how to use this yet this is
embarrassing so yeah there we go
that's my phone my little child I love
you what should I name my phone guys
Samuel I don't know why I thought of
that all right Mary have you guys um
overall I would say I like the phone
then again I've been an iPhone ho for
years so I don't know if it's really
that great but I like it if this iPhone
exploded in my face I would still be
team iPhone like I'm never gonna need
Android anyways PS bargain hunters tip
um I literally walked out the door with
this phone brand new despite not having
an upgrade for $36 um $36 a month
anyways there's 0% interest on the
iPhone upgrade program so I can get a
new phone whenever I want like when the
eight comes out uh in
a year or the 7s or whatever I can just
walk in there and get a new one so that
seems pretty cool they do charge you tax
and the first month's payment on the
first day so I paid one hundred and
fifteen dollars I think for my brand-new
little pupper and my data doesn't change
my plan doesn't change the only thing is
I have a new phone now aren't it cool if
I do say so myself anyway guys there you
have it that is my iPhone 7 little mini
baby review from a non tech person point
of view so if you have any questions
about the phone uh you can totally ask
me and I will attempt to answer them or
at least from you know my point of view
if you have any real questions I would
definitely suggest calling Apple because
they don't weigh more than I do but I
hope you guys enjoyed have a great day
if you have any other questions comments
concerns all my socials are at Universal
so feel free to hit me up on there I
will always respond and kisses till next
time you guys have a great one XO
ring ring hello yes it's Madonna I want
my money
