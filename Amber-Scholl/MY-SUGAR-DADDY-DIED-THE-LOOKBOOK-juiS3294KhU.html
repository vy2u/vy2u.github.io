Oh Harold has passed away of mysterious
circumstances please give me a moment
two more
totally getting what is up you guys it's
amber and welcome back to my channel and
if you are new wolrd are you in for a
wild ride today so in case you couldn't
tell by that over-the-top intro I just
thought it would be super fun to go
ahead and do a lookbook today based
around the idea that our sugar daddy has
died frankly because that's just a very
specific aesthetic and also because I
just thought it'd be really funny so
quick disclaimer before we get started
obviously this entire lookbook is a joke
I do not advocate sugar daddies it is
20:17 girlfriend via own sugar data but
for now here we go the official my sugar
daddy side Senate book oh yes kicking
off the lookbook by showing up to the
funeral looking for a new sugar that it
already know I'm getting anyways so
kicking off our morning vibes in a black
corset I'm matching black choker from
forever 21 and of course some fabulous
black shorts to pull the whole look
together throw of the Black Hills to
compliments are already slaying sledge
and there we have it should have no
trouble finding a brand new sugar daddy
at the funeral in this look I'm kidding
you guys hello Hugh are ready for my
interview so this is basically what I
would imagine a Playboy bunny would wear
to a business meeting if she had to go
to a funeral right after so let's look
at comprised of a black crop top
matching legging both from forever 21
matching flowy duster from this same
location so make sure if everybody's
because that is the greatest idea ever
and believe it or not I just have to
have this federal AP bow thing is
sitting in my craft roar so there you go
you can see the full look head to toe
ooh babe ed slay see in a few you Wow
and this my friends is what we're going
to wear to the wheel reading right after
shopping on Rodeo Drive so this look is
actually something I've been wanting to
wear for a while very kind of Wednesday
Addams
fired you can get the top into the plain
black crop I paired with a white
collared shirt you can see the white
kind of peeps up because it's a crop top
so paired it with a black plane a cotton
skirt both I think five dollars total
from forever21 whatcha wouldn't know it
when paired with these killer shoes that
I've worn in so many lookbooks before
you can see I was too lazy to actually
lace these up but these are super cool
little lace-up gladiator booties that I
am obsessed with talk to look off with
the DIY sunglasses that I made you can
see the full look head to toe and there
we go
ready to go find out how many millions
will be inheriting ma'am you just
inherited 1 billion dollars what are you
going to do now we're going sell them
all ok I'll be honest I just really
wanted to wear this outfit in a lookbook
and couldn't think of another one to
wear it in so this is our shopping at
the mall look nothing says sugar baby
quite like satin so we've got a little
satiny dress you can have these little
satiny dresses anywhere I'm pretty sure
I got this one at t.j.maxx in the
lingerie section then I do corset bells
were super in but I thought it'd be more
fun to just buy a literal corset so you
can see this is actually a full-on
corset you can kind of tell in the back
there but anyway so I've got that paired
it with this tweed fluffy jacket which
is so funny everyone always asks if it's
Chanel no this was literally $20 from
some website in China so I'll see if I
can find a link and throw that in that
after shoes we got the clear easy dupes
away these literally all the time
because Kim has them and I love them so
there we go ready to go hit the shops in
style boom boom oh baby
now this is a killer look no pun
intended of course so for this look we
are serving chickadee rail lips with a
black off the shoulder top Chanel
inspired children that I got downtown
for $2.99
our chicken is skirt oh yeah and of
course the chicken ooh look wouldn't be
complete without our chicken feet you
guys know I love a good pun but these
are actually the shoes that I needed my
DIY shoe video so cute I love them
mmmm I was arrested on an honest man
Anna what I look mama
well well well since our last adventure
the sugar baby went so well I figure if
we would want to do it again so this
look is what we're going to wear to our
wedding at the courthouse - sugar daddy
number 11 so here you can see this is a
white fluffy faux fur jacket I got in
London for 20 bucks I wear it all the
time I love it
these are the same shorts I was wearing
earlier but in white flip my jacket off
here so you can see it a little better
but this top is very lacy wedding
inspired which is why I thought it would
be perfect for our new valves of course
match the whole look with the white
fluffy jacket - the white fluffy shoes
ooh whoo so cute
couldn't get married without the bling
bling topped off the look with this
beautiful white rose just because I
don't know was in my room and I had one
till death do us part for 30 million oh
yes baby ask you oh my god are these not
the coolest pants you've ever seen in
your entire life oh to be honest they
would probably be a lot cooler if I
didn't have a giant tan light on my hips
but hey yes that point Lulu I honestly
feel like Princess Jasmine in this look
so this is what we're going to wear to
the grocery store now just because we
can as you can see this is just a satiny
bustier crop top matched with some
groovy pants of the same material throw
in some basic nude shoes because I don't
know you know the pants are so wild I
figured I'd calm it down in at least one
area we are now ready to go buy whatever
it is you buy at the grocery store in
banks and then can you tell me where the
yogurt is I don't know why a free yogurt
I don't even eat yogurt but anyways that
is this look whew this top is just so
classic fence a woman lady I'm living -
bad Harold is dead no okay anyway so
this is the next enough so you might
recognize this top this is actually the
only thing that I bought from my trying
on wild outfit video if you didn't see
that all and get there but this is that
top that I just thought was so cool kind
of classy kind of sassy and all-around
exactly my style so to pair the
conservative top I thought I would match
it with some
but they recover my leg girls oh of
course to make my legs look even longer
there with some nude shoes that just
really amp up the imaginary length of my
legs so there we have this final look to
be honest I'm not really sure where
exactly we're going in this one but I
don't know perhaps a PTA meeting
you know something corporate you know
what I think is funny us about this
lookbook is the fact that I didn't have
to buy any of this this is all just
stuff I had in my house so pretty clear
to see this is definitely a funeral
morning look and I just thought this one
was so funny we've got a little faux fur
touch thing to show off the bling bling
a literal superwoman mesh cape that just
is adorned with pearls to make it extra
classy what's underneath the glamour
cape you ask well boom we got some
serious sexist sausage vibes going on
here so we're about a full on latex
dress that really just kind of speaks
for itself
so not really sure why I accept eyes
this so much but hey okay you can wear
whatever you want and of course some
feather issues because the bet not to
scream sugar baby for what none at all
super widow to the right and last but
not least this my friends is what you're
going to wear when you realize you are a
strong beautiful independent woman foods
don't need no man this entire list book
was a joke and by following your dreams
and believing in yourself you can be
your very own sugar daddy all on your
own

my sugar daddy toys lookbook um I hope
