unfortunately that's not what my real
morning routine is like that's just what
it is in dreamland by Axel morning
routine is a lot less glamorous and a
lot more just like I imagine just like
yours very everyday very kind of simple
easy and not that interesting but I'm
going to show it to you anyway because
yeah guys wanted to see it so here we go
my much less glamorous than I would
otherwise like it to be morning routine
my day would begin bright and early with
me being absolutely terrified of my
mannequin that I was standing by my bed
I don't know why I leave it hovering
right there but anyways once I go from
the fear it's a great morning so I'll
stare at my shoe wall for a little bit
because it's just glistens in the Sun
and looks so singing beautiful then I'll
go ahead look for my phone where is my
phone I don't know I lose it almost
every morning despite the fact that I
always have it attempting to be plugged
in if I'm out I need a new plug but
that's another story
we're in my home dig dig dig oh there we
go
I always find it eventually today it's
hiding under my ass
how nice anyway once I locate my phone
hiding wherever it may be I'll go ahead
scroll through Instagram you know
looking at all the pretty pictures check
out the latest tweets because there's
nothing like a good meme to start your
day on the right but I just love my
phone so much because you guys live in
myself and I love you
then unfortunately I check my emails
which is always overflowing I literally
hate checking my emails
so look just take my mind off my evil
emails I'll go ahead and answer all your
guys's comments let me assume of course
not without a good typo because after
all it's me at this point I'm literally
starving so I'll go ahead and wrap the
blanket on me because I sleep in a bra
and underwear so you know grant you two
naked go ahead go to the kitchen oh but
first kind of say hello to yourself good
morning Beauty great okay
now gonna go just go ahead grab one of
my favorite little smoothy things I'm
obsessed with these they're like vegan
protein shakes a taste like coffee I
love them so go ahead drink that get my
day ready love it all right what am I
going to do next to knows usually I'll
do some sort of stupid thing like throw
on my robe and just be really extra and
dance in the mirror because you got to
get your day started off right with some
fun okay no I don't always do this but I
do always go to my bathroom and get
ready what the heck am I even doing I
don't know but whatever here we go okay
first things first I will take this
little headband thing that I'm literally
obsessed with and I'll go ahead and slip
it on just to keep my hair out of my
face I know I know I put it on upside
down here I'm not perfect
looks whatever look cute who cares
well I'm getting ready I like to play
some epic classical jams unfortunately
for me my video will be removed don't I
play any more of this song so now that I
danced a little bit take my vitamins I
take two woman's alive gummy vitamins
are awesome I just don't know multi-vise
you know get my nutrition and then my
favorite little sugar bear hairs I don't
know why I'm eating them like this today
but I mean I don't know I guess why not
basically there's a little gummy
vitamins that help your hair grow not to
mention they're vegetarian cruelty-free
and tastes like candy I truly mean it
when I say I would not recommend
anything I don't actually love but let
me tell you I am a proud to be sponsored
by sugar bear hair I love those little
things then I will go ahead and brush my
teeth with some Colgate optic white
toothpaste la la my fancy electric
toothbrush you know just leave my
boyfriend brushing our teeth together
then I go ahead and floss my teeth
because I'm a perfectionist when it
comes to my teeth is it weird to be
flossing on camera kind of oh well
whatever um so next I do my skincare
Athene so basically all I'll do is I'll
take the little like face scrub stuff
and scream so I look a little crazy I'll
put it all over my face then I take my
awesome little face scrubber thing
courtesy of my friends over at vanity
planet they sent this to me like a month
ago and I didn't try it for like a long
time I just didn't feel like it and now
I'm literally obsessive it I don't know
how I ever live without it it just like
gets rid of all the dead skin cells and
makes my skin look so soft
and smooth and gets it ready to put on
the makeup so big fan what you're gonna
want to make your buck there's three
detachable brush heads one for
exfoliating one for unclog your pores
and then there's one that just kind of
like cleans everything off and lifts
away to dead skin cells like you can see
that's the one I use the most because
that's filthy I love it if you want to
get your elevate great partner up with
me on this one code spin for Amber
seventy percent off yo welcome next I
always always always put on sunscreen
this is Neutrogena I got it from Tulsa
for like 15 bucks I just am really
terrified of getting wrinkles so I put
sunscreen on every single day
religiously because who doesn't want to
stay looking first teen forever speaking
of being 13 next I put on my favorite
perfume that I've been wearing since I
was literally in seventh grade I'm
obsessed with it it's pink sugar it
makes me smell like a cupcake
grown men tell me I smell amazing balus
big sugars looking a girl uh-uh
what else do I even hear in the morning
so I'll just go ahead and put on my
makeup thoughts into the video we're
gonna flash-forward shut up oh yes my
highlights just perfect and I look great
now okay so I take out my nighttime
extensions I'll put in my fancy day
extensions that are the best hidden
crown hair been wearing these for years
I love them love them love them there we
go
excellent I'm just really an abraded
mood today though so I braided it again
so alrighty and then I will go ahead and
go in my closet pick out whatever my
outfit of the day is going to be which
is usually something extremely
ridiculous and very extra over the top
even though I literally don't go
anywhere once I picked out my shoes of
the day which are always got to be Killa
I will go ahead grab my favor carrot my
keys and I am out the door ready for the
day
Who am I kidding I never leave the house
coming back inside plot my ass down and
get Larry have you guys that is
literally my morning routine um I know
it's not like the most interesting thing
in the world but you asked so their dues
I switched back into my original outfit
because to be honest I like this better
and if I could I would totally wear this
in the streets but unfortunately that's
not allowed
all right I've actually it is allowed
just probably frowned upon by most of
society anyways I love you guys so very
much as always if you have any questions
