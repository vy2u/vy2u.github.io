ahead and do my nighttime routine for
you what is up you guys
it's amber welcome back to my channel
and today of course we're not gonna do
any boring old nighttime routine I'm
gonna go ahead and show you my very
extra nighttime routine which is
actually just my you know my personal
everyday nighttime routine but I do most
of the world it's probably not so north
huh so without further ado here we go
very extra nighttime routine my
nighttime routine begins after a long
long day at the office full of hard work
and uh you know business things so I
come home and take some selfies and
whatever my killer outfit of the day is
oh yes mama
work it then I take it off and change
into some even more killer PJs because
you never know if your house burns down
in the middle of the night you want to
look cute for the sexy fireman am I
gonna get demonetised for this probably
okay anyways now it's time to start the
unread iing process and take off our
killer highlights
sad but necessary okay so we begin with
our cusco brand remover wipes because
I'm cheap in some little all Mae iPads
washee-washee great great it's like a
high-end spa but you're at home and it's
not a spa oh yes it's working you can
see my zits perfect they're not for a
way that nasty artwork creation and it's
time to begin with Mars skincare lately
I've been using a brand called bio
clarity because for those of you who
don't know yet I recently become a vegan
because I just love the animals
so bio clarity is a perfect France use
because it's naturally derived vegan
cruelty free paraben free sulfate free
basically everything freeze total
skincare system first I'll use the
little cleanser so I went a towel and
make my face nice and wet to apply it
you can see it's made with chamomile and
green tea so all good stuff to smooth
the skin and even out pores and tone so
you rub that in with my fingers until it
looks perfect like a Santa gift oh okay
kidding so then I'll rinse that off and
then it's time for step two which is
kind of like the acne fighter so I'll
put that all over my sets which
conveniently for this video I have three
huge ones lol next we'll do the restore
step which has
looks what Peck is that you ask well
have no fear bill nye the science ember
is here flora Lux is bio clarity
secretive that's not so secret now but
it's a plant-based ingredient that helps
detoxify and calm the skin all naturally
Coolio
so I'll rub that in until it's oh but
Frick the men say and now that I'm
feeling clean green and never me no
moisturize with the hydrator because
well I'm terrified of kidding wrinkles
and vitamin A &amp;amp; E and the lightweight
formula help with the back plus it's
super breathable and perfect for any
skin type which is super rad so I'll rub
it all over my face and also my neck
because I know I'm right next to get
wrinkly either heck maybe I'll put on my
chest too if I wasn't demonetized before
and definitely do it smell so
anyways back to the video so huge shout
out to bio clarity for a greeting to
partner with me on this video so if you
guys want your own they're giving you a
huge discount 50% off your first month
with code ampere the link is in the
description you're welcome so now that
our scada is baby bottom soft it's time
to deal with our hair I enjoy I forgot
to mention I've been wearing my
beautiful outfit of the day heels this
whole time so now it's time to change it
to my fancy nighttime heels you guys
think I'm kidding I'm not I heard
wearing heels while you do everyday
activity is like you know doing squats
on your tub and trying not to die makes
your legs look more toned plus they look
fired up anyway since I don't want to
die in a freak tub accident I'll just
hop down here for a second okay great
back to safety so hair so now it's time
to do my hair which is all extensions by
the way so I'll just slip that out
really quick yep tada these are my
hittin crown hair extensions which are
totally a game changer I'm obsessed I've
been wearing them for years you can see
it's just like a halo of hair that rests
on your head but kind of like a little
invisible string I have a full video on
those somewhere on my channel but been
wearing them for years the best thing I
ever found this is my hair without
extensions by the way so in case you
were wondering so anyway so I'll go
ahead and put the daytime extensions
down and I'll put a nighttime extensions
in yes I have nighttime extensions I can
and you just never know what could
happen in the middle of the night so I
slipped those on and throw my hair into
a braid or you know some sort of
nighttime look which by the way how in
the heck do people film their nighttime
routines in a normal way without the
tripod in the mirror
get it so all you youtubers have fancy
YouTube boyfriends
maybe they do I don't know if any of you
know one who's available have them calm
you know okay so back to the brain and
us look at all cute for the next
unwearying activity can you guess what
it is
hint hint that's right we're waxing our
eyebrows JK no we are brushing our teeth
and totally obsessed with teeth so I
keep my incision for duper clean all the
time I have the totally baller
toothbrush it's electric very fancy how
do you brush your teeth on camera in a
non disgusting way I don't know I'm
failing so we'll just move on to
flossing which you know is actually also
kind of gross to film so we'll just move
on again to the wash so now their teeth
are shiny and beautiful we're pretty
much done here so off the lights
and wonder over the bed where I hate to
admit it but usually the first thing I
do is a shop online for whatever it is I
want that day even when I don't need
anything which is a problem because
often times I wake up to like 6 Amazon
boxes and idk what they even offer every
shoe storage closet is getting a little
too full help so after buying whatever
nonsense I buy I'll go on YouTube and
answer you guys's comments scroll
through my good ol Instagram Twitter
tweet kim kardashian a thousand times
until she responds just kidding I don't
always do that just sometimes tumblr - I
have a weird love for memes then I will
get up and dance around my house to
Frank Sinatra for at least 30 minutes
actually have really bad anxiety so that
this calms me down a lot
I'd like to stare at the view out my
window because if you don't my story at
all you know how much it means to me
every time I look at the sky from my
roof all the glory to God thank you so
after all this it's usually pretty late
so I'll hop in bed
scroll through tinder and bubble but
this never works so usually had to
snuggle into bed and dream of glitter
and Harry Styles and that my friends if
my everyday make time routine so there
you have you guys that is my very extra
nighttime routine I hope you guys
enjoyed the video because as always I
loved making it for you coming this
upside down like this is actually really
tiring my arms so I'm gonna not make
this ending too long but thank you guys
so much for watching don't forget to
subscribe to the channel for lots more
fun extra nonsense and I will see you
guys next time I love you my sweet
beautiful baby angels XO you're such a
good dancer Harry just look at the
footwork there
I really got to stop doing this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
