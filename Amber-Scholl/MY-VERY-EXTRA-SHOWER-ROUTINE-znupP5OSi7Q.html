would actually make a video like that
did you come on this is a family channel
what's up guys it's amber welcome back
to my channel and today I just thought
it would be fun to pretend to be a
beauty guru for the evening and um show
you my shower routine not in a sexy way
at all just like shampooing my hair and
whatnot unless of course you tuned in
for a sexy video in which case it's
going to be very very sexy don't worry
though we are getting wet and wild today
no I'm just kidding again do or not or
not anyways how would you just see for
yourself without further ado here we go
my very extra shower routine first
things first I like to shower at night
so I come home from a long day at the
office
aka just sitting on my couch editing
videos and then I'll start to get ready
to shower I'm always wearing a full
outfit ooh look at this look
and usually tons of jewelry so I have to
take that all off first I feel so naked
without them then it's time to really
get naked but for this video I'm gonna
wear a swimsuit cute color right I've
been loving red lately anyway now that
I'm in the shower I like to have a
little fun I'll pump up jams and sing
I never let anyone see or hear me do
this but today I guess I'll just show
the entire internet why not then I go
ahead and use my microphone her face
washer to get rid of the day's makeup
this is the radiant spin brush from a
company called Duvall and I use it with
this mix nature cleansing soap which is
also super cool because the soap is
custom made fresh to order just for me
with ingredients that I picked like this
round I picked tea tree oil silk protein
and hyaluronic acid because I want to
stay looking young and baby-faced and
all those ingredients are meant to keep
skin looking like you just celebrated
your 12th birthday which with no makeup
on I low-key kind of do but anywho Zee I
just go ahead wash my face off with the
spin brush gently it's believing the
dead skin cells and unclogging my pores
to prevent any breakouts
better be careful about my lash
extension so gotta keep those on fleek
honestly ever since I started using this
I noticed my skin looks way cleaner
because makeup wipes alone just don't
get it all so this has been a game of
change up so super cool I'm teaming up
with mix nature and Duval on this
special deal for you guys so right now
code amber gives you 70% off the spin
brush link in the descriptions and mix
nature you don't even need a code it's
just 20% off all orders over $70 and
free shipping anyways like the shower
rings once my face is fully all clean I
will start my hair people always ask
what shampoo i buy i buy whatever is on
sale this week it happens to be this
revlon diamond glow it was pink and
diamond so i was into it next week is
something else I don't know shake it up
why not they all work so my advice is
always to pinch pennies where you can so
you to buy new shoes woo beauties
anyways all suck it up rinse it out have
fun wow wow wow I look so handsome oh
look baby go ahead do the same thing
with the conditioner I'll let the
conditioner sit in my hair while I rinse
off my body I'll go ahead and pop the
head off my face cleaner brush because
it's a body cleaner too and add on the
big body brush and then I will scrub all
over to exfoliate for this I use my
homemade coconut sugar scrub that I put
in my other smooth skin video which
really looks disgusting but I swear it
smells amazing it's literally just
coconut oil and sugar then I will rub
that all over my body with the scrubber
to get extra smooth fancy skin but then
I'll grab some soap just to make sure
I'm all extra clean and once that's done
rinse it off and shave believe it a rod
I buy razors in bulk at the dollar store
because you know they're $1 for a pack
of 12 and I get fresh ones every time so
why not I find it works better than the
expensive ones you get at the drugstore
it'll go ahead rinse out my conditioner
again today since I'm in a pamper hood
we're gonna use my mixed nature hair
mask you can see it's just kind of like
a smooth mass treatment I put on my hair
to help hold the color and prevent
damage since I dye my hair at home you
guys probably saw that video too and
like I said all the mixed nature stuff
is totally customizable so as a bonus I
put bio keratin and silk protein and
this one to help keep my hair extra
shiny and smooth and it smells like a
flower actual flower not included this
is my shower video and I make the rules
we're gonna go ahead and use this fake
flower anyway while we wait for the mask
to do its magic whoo yes beautiful look
so it's all good to have you feeling
like taking a nap in a spa but since
we're in the shower and I don't want to
drown I'll just rinse that off and just
kind of do the thing where you just stay
in there for a while because you know
showers are so great and you don't ever
want to get out but since I want to save
some water for the fish in the sea and
save the planet I'll get out towel off
sit down throw on some lotion this is a
little ocean from cope re I freaking
love this stuff it's like golden coconut
oil oh my god so I just rub that all
over like you can see the shine ooh
beautiful and then I'll usually end up
just sitting on my bed for like 20
minutes scrolling through Instagram and
Twitter responding to your comments
before I get way too cold so I'll pick
out a fluffy outfit to wear yes girl
fabulous dance around my room a little
bit dum de dum de dum and then start to
fix my hair blow-dry it recognized this
guy for my target haul he turned out
great
maybe it's Maybelline okay now anyways
then I'll straighten my hair la la ready
straight II throw in my hitting ground
hair extensions I have a separate video
on these two if you want to check it out
they're the best oh wow long luxurious
locks in two seconds fantastic then
finally I will do my makeup
la la la la Oh gorgeous darling better
than once I'm finally all ready I pick
out an outfit of the day and go out on
the town
JK like I said I shower at night so
usually I just go to bed and dream about
a night on the town but today it's like
12:00 p.m. while I'm filming this so
I'll just get up and film the outro of
this video
there you have it you guys that is a
wrap on my very extra shower routine oh
sorry guys had to change my lip color
there it was really driving me nuts oh
it wasn't the same color as my shirt I
like really like things to match anyways
myself you have you guys that is my very
extra shower routine I hope you guys
enjoyed the video because that was
actually very difficult for me to film
not gonna lie like my camera isn't even
waterproof so I was just bringing it in
the shower and hoping you know nothing
really bad happened so good thing that
all worked out well
I hope you guys enjoyed showering with
me um oh dear nope that mmm okay gotta
redo that really trying to keep this
video not creepy and it's very difficult
but I hope you enjoyed my shower routine
