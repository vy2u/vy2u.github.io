for using our texting service thank you
do you wanna watch The One Direction
movie meet you up you guys it's amber
welcome back to my channel and if you're
new hi um I would say usually my
interests aren't always that weird but
honestly that'd be a lie they are always
that weird so what's up welcome to the
weird party today as you can tell by the
funny intro I just thought it would be
fun to do a lookbook centered around the
idea of Netflix and chilling because
because whether you're alone in bed
eating popcorn like me or if you have
that special someone we all need to look
cute for our binge watching or
non-bender watching because you decided
to catch up on your studies of course
like I said family channel without
further ado here we go
Ambra shoals nonsensical productions
presents be officially unofficial
Netflix and chill
oh honey yes the work welcome to the
Netflix and chill runway show so for
this look we are kicking it off with
some very understated vibes totally
getting literally nothing I do is
understated so here we have a festival
this shirts I got on Amazon super cute
just like a real spoof on Netflix and
chilling I actually think it's a man's
t-shirt but I love it men's t-shirts are
wonderful things to sleep in especially
if you don't got your own man's why not
just order your own man's clothes
honestly don't even ask me where I got
this I have no idea I think I got it on
eBay like five years ago for a Halloween
costume but I'll look for a similar one
if you two want to look fabulous matched
it with some funky soft slippers I got
at Target oh look I can't guarantee that
they'll call you again but I can't
guarantee if you show up in this your
Netflix and chill date will never forget
you tonsai doesn't get much more Netflix
and shows I'm Victoria's Secret so this
is an excellent so this is what we've
got here you guys actually probably saw
me buy this in my Victoria's Secret haul
it's super cute little fluffy um sweater
set thing we got the matching sweatpants
su la la and of course the slippers too
because you know that stay cozy
boo-boo-boo-boo-boo very ariana grande
vibes with the ponytail Benna this book
was actually believe it or not inspired
by Drake I know I know so random but I
actually met him at a party one times
and he was wearing basically the exact
same outfit but in orange and without
the pink logo on it so I guess not
really the same but totally reminds me
of him so we're gonna go ahead and say
this outfit was inspired I know when
that hotline bling ooh no no no no no oh
yeah what I'm wearing knee high socks I
just can't help a resister do that so
this is a next look for channeling that
one Tom Cruise movie which I can't
remember the name of right now and we've
got the super soft silky shirt I got it
off Amazon you can see it's like kind of
wrinkly because I just opened it out of
the package but it actually comes in
like every single color so super soft
and fun and it's kind of long too so
it's a little bit like conservative mom
shirt but also still a little bit of
sexy of course some more knee-high socks
because honestly it's winter and I just
like cannot get enough of these I wear
them around my house
all the time and there you go perfect
for dancing around your kitchen and or
sliding across the floor in alright here
we go the sexiest side of Netflix and
chill
not really but definitely is on the
sultry side this is literally like my
new favorite pair of pajamas it's just
like a top with some cute little booty
shorts which are really booty shorts so
definitely for some like special chillin
kept the slippers on and voila
I'm loving it sponsored by no I'm just
kidding they definitely not sponsor this
alright anyways next look 2007 is
freakin back y'all yes so here is our
next look serious Paris Hilton vibes in
this this is a spoof in my opinion on
the Juicy Couture tracksuit trends but
this is brilliant track back Oh fun fun
so here you can see it's just like a
little velour zip up Hoodie with the
matching sweat pants underneath the
jacket we've got a matching little
velour bralette to pair it with some
fluffy slippers because you know why not
also funny side note when I fell but
like this I look completely naked but
that's not the point of this so just
really soft cozy and perfect for what
you would write and Netflix and chill if
you thought you up might go out to
dinner first alright this next look is
called 50 shades of grey
why not because of why you're thinking
but because we're wearing all great
actually got this at forever 21
literally yesterday how cute is this I
saw it in the sale section it was like
whoa frickin sold I got it for like I
think $11 even see it's just a super
comfy little gray sweat suit type of
thing with a little drawstring at the
waist which I think I'm a little too
short for this but this is supposed to
be on your waist but instead it's like
on my hip bones so probably like this
but you know whatever
and of course look super cute with the
gray slippers and tada you are on a
Sophia Steel clip not really but
whatever you can pretend
hello I'm ready for the stranger things
marathon I'm kidding this makes no sense
but this is my fabulous sugar daddy robe
that I made so if you want to see the
DIY on that it's linked below
but anyways doubt for thoroughness
is actually what's underneath it so this
is actually another one of those outfits
that super great for wearing around your
house or in public because it is so
stinkin cute soft comfy and somewhat
real-life appropriate actually born is
in a ton of videos but this is literally
just like a super cute little cheap
off-the-shoulder black sweater match
with some little black shorts looks kind
of like a really short romper pair it
with my new sneakers I just love these a
dream come true so thank you guys and um
so there are no that is this look ooh
super super cute love it mmm sparkly
next look we also got glittery nation

quite like not wearing any pants but we
actually are wearing pants we've got
these cute little lacy black shorts I
also got from Victoria's Secret like a
bajillion years ago for $7 cuz I had a
banger coupon but this shirt I just
recently got it's like an oversized
sparkly white tee Luther acute severe
acute paired it with some little ankle
socks in grey and uh you got a very cute
slumber party slash bedtime look la la

figured around what else my favorite
loungewear apparel silk robes nothing
make you feel like a queen quite like a
silky robe so this one I got off Amazon
it is like the most beautiful golden
color you can't really tell this
lighting but it's really nice soaked and
I think this was only like 15 bucks so
so cute with the lace detailing and
everything I was going to pair it with
my fluffy slippers that I made oh my
goodness they're so cute but um I can
only locate one of them so that is why I
have one foot barefooted but yeah

what's underneath the Rope what my
favorite ever bodysuit and some jean
shorts because you can get ready in this

things to wear because it looks like a
lingerie but for the daytime or the
nighttime or you know whatever time you
