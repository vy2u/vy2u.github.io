welcome back to my channel so today is
going to be quite possibly the most
extra video I have ever felt because I
literally had to choke back tears when
my favorite website misguided emailed me
and was like hey amber do you want to
showcase some of our New Year's Eve
looks I literally had to stop myself
from throwing up on my computer so today
I'm going to me to show you how to look
banging on New Year's Eve both on a
budget and just fallen out so here we go
New Year's Eve styles oh my god look at
this shirt I literally want to cry
courtesy of misguided here we go first
up is fully inspired by one of the most
iconic photos in my personal opinion of
all time like wow this photo changed my
life when I saw it so I went ahead and
took my own take on it and this is what
I came up with like honest to god you
guys are you even ready for this I don't
even know are you ready for this look oh
my God look at this
alright so this is the first outfit that
I picked off the website now like I said
I love being really really extra so of
course I loved all the bedazzle Achon
this like look at this you guys the
detailing on this is unreal I oh my god
I could look at this for the rest of my
life and I think I would never get bored
of it but anyways can really see it up
close Wow
this shirt looks like it cost seven
hundred million dollars um granted this
was a little pricier I think this shirt
was like 140 dollars however they always
are having sales like even just for
having a student um student ID you get
30% off all the time so like I said I
wouldn't have picked anything that I
wouldn't have bought myself um because
Wow oh my god I would buy this shirt in
18 colors anyways also you can check
this out look at how cool this earring
thing is I'm dying but it's like a cuff
earring so I don't actually have my ears
pierced like that I only have the one
but I just thought that was so a fun
boom
bug I don't know why I always go into
that xampp' but buying it write it in a
wise all right so now usually I wouldn't
pair something so bedazzled II with
something also so bedazzling um but
actually Who am I kidding yes I totally
would so anyway
this is the skirt that I paired it with
um oh my God look at this thing so this
is all made of like hand-sewn crystally
beaded things I feel like I'm like a
host for the Home Shopping Network you
guys look at the skirt it's made of
crystal beads but holy Wow okay
so unbelievably sparkly and shiny and
studying and think they shake so cute so
it really like I just thought this was
the most New Year's Eve looking skirt
I've ever seen cha-cha also here the
shoes that I'm wearing with it now these
are a directive of the easy season two
sandals now clear shoes and moon shoes
like this are really awesome because
they elongate your legs all while
matching the outfit so literally I can
wear these with anything I can wear them
with jeans or with this outfit and they
just make your legs look longer and
fabulous and girly Denton on Tina New
Year's feet ready for action I don't
know what I did mean by that but
whatever I love it so much my neighbors
are gonna think I'm being murdered okay
anyways if sparkles aren't your thing
perhaps an excessive amount of feathers
is your thing cuz it's serving my mind
okay so here we go this is my look
number two I love feathers you guys you
guys know oh it still the tag on this
purse but anyways I mean could you get
any more extra than this like matching
your feather refers to your feathery
skirt done Santana anyways so this look
I thought was just super fun because
it's not quite as extra as the sparkles
but I mean I guess it is but it's in a
different way so I've got the matching
um you can hear that I don't even know
what this is a necklace yes there we go
choker and then a waist choker no I'm
just kidding I know this is called a
bell so we thought those two things
matching just because it's New Year's
Eve why not um I've also got these
awesome shoes like look at how cute
these are Wow oh my god this is adorable
um so to go along with my chickeny
looking bootie uh I've got some ballet
shoes that I thought were so so fun like
you can see the bottom is actually like
a chrome thing which makes it a little
more comfortable to dance the night away
because it's thicker and they just tie
up so cute again apologies on the tan
line on my ankles like what can you do
can't always be perfect so this top is
actually just like a plain cotton
turtleneck bodysuit super cute was only
like 20 bucks this skirt is just beyond
fun like I could not help myself and I
saw this on the website I was like I am
losing my mind over this it's like the
funnest most partay oh my gosh it's just
so cute and it's so fun to shake and
 in and dance we all know I can't
dance but that doesn't stop say not my
buttons Vega look number three boom what
but look at this look you guys oh my god
this is so cute I want to scream I have
already been screaming so I don't know
why I say I want to scream when I
already am in the process of screaming
but look at this look at the detailing
on this oh look at it really really look
at it cuz this is unbelievable looking
oh wow so you can see the beaded
detailing on this is just ridiculous is
like Super Bowl Mon inspired looking
kind of thing as you can see like the
back let's see if this will focus there
we go you can see the back of this is
like fully embroidered completely the
back of the bodysuit is not but the
front is and the arms are like the arms
are so intense look at this and when I
hadn't paired it with these totally
awesome shoes these were so cheap by the
way these were like 35 bucks and amazing
they like look like this from the front
very gladiator style like you can see
the detailing here and whatnot it's like
kind of got like some little holes in it
and whatever it it's peep toe which is
fun but then the back is just like so
stinking cool I just oh my gosh I was
dying over these I thought these were
awesome and looked really fab with this
look this is like the super sexy version
of something that your mom would wear in
the 80s oh and I'm so glad the trend is
back mmm
and what's really cool about this you
guys is this is actually a bodysuit and
a skirt so you can totally wear this
with other things
you can mix and match and get um
multiple uses out of the one outfit so
like here you can see I just paired it
with the white turtleneck from earlier
with the bottoms and it still looks so
cute not quite as over-the-top but still
freakin adorable and I left the same
boots on just because I love these are
these boots we're gonna call them boots
well yeah so cute and you can mix and
match it and wear it more every day
sister isn't everyday outfit if you want
it to be where would you like who cares
life is short also I forgot to show this
earlier look at this little faux fur
throw thing like this looks so real you
guys know that I'm a vegetarian and
would never wear real fur so I love faux
fur and this one in particular looks is
so luxurious Wow okay so my favorite
thing about shopping if it's guided is
they always have sales and swipers
around and student discounts just like
actually it's insane but the other
favorite thing is there have so much
product that they basically have dupes
of their own things like look at this
this is a skirt that's super similar to
the one that I'm wearing however a look
you can get basically the same look for
even half of that pretty dang cool if I
do say so myself
so included links to all of the things I
wore in the video below in addition to
some other things that I just love that
I wish that I ordered and am probably
ordering as I edit this video so there
have you guys that is my little
misguided haul I hope you loved the
video because oh my god I literally
think this is my favorite outfit I've
ever worn in my lifetime and I can't
believe it alright anyways um so thank
you so much for watching as always I
love you guys so very much thank you for
everything and since this is probably my
last video of 2016 I just wanted to say
thank you so much from the bottom of
steps of my heart for everything that
you've done for me these last few months
I couldn't do anything I do without you
guys so thank you thank you thank you I
love you more than life itself and I
cannot wait to share 2017 with you and
all the magical little memories we're
gonna make I just I literally could try
thinking about it so thank you I'm so
excited for all that's to come so I love
you guys again wishing you the most
magical New Year's Eve and of course the
most magical New Year's so I love you
guys
