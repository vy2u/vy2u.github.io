at how beautiful it's like 6:00 in the
morning and I saw this outside my window
so I ran up onto the roof to show you
guys I could look at this forever but I
mean I'm also literally just ran up here
in a blanket and no pants so we're gonna
go back inside good morning Sunshine's I
hope you enjoyed the sunrise as much as
I did that was actually only like 30
minutes ago it is bright and early up in
here because I've lots to do today but I
still wanted to go ahead and film a
little quick video before my day get
started so uh happy 7:00 a.m. my
roommates are going to kill me but
anyways so today since we all know I
clearly have an addiction to buying
things on the internet well I just
thought it'd be fun to go ahead and show
you guys my little online shopping haul
of all the things I got in the mail this
week because every day is Christmas if
you buy yourself stuff online is that
bad is that not really a quote whatever
it's the quote of this video but uh yeah
so without further ado oh here we go a
shopping addicts online shopping call
but BOM I really should have organized
this better but I did it so um what
shall we start with already so we're
gonna start with the pick pile right
here because pink is one of my favorite
colors though you wouldn't know it
because I'm always wearing black I'm
actually not depressed I swear I just
like really like the way I look in black
anyways I'm rambling as always I'd ask
you guys on Twitter all the online shops
that you guys wanted me to try so I
ordered for the first time off of a
website called pretty little thing
because that one kept coming up so this
is what I got off there I got literally
a ton of stuff so I laid all out in a
second but one of the things that I
started with was I love basics so I got
some like oversized sweatshirt II things
super fun you can see just like an
oversized little sweater dress um like I
said I got it in three colors such a fun
basic I also got my outfit of the day
from there that is this little black
thing that I've worn in like a million
videos because I love it
like you can see this is my little look
um it's supposed to be off the shoulder
but I mean just one off the shoulder I
think I also got the pink version which
looks really lame just like sitting here
but it's such fun loungewear it's so
cozy and nice selena is making noise in
the kitchen but that's okay lately I
feel like I've also been really meeting
more professional wear but uh since we
might take on professional wear is
really ridiculous this is what I got for
that I just thought this was super funky
and cool did this count as business
attire I don't know in my business of
trying on clothes at my house sure like
this is so cute look at the little lacy
blazer I love it
ignore the like giant piles of trash but
whatever so quick to second review on
that place I would say pretty cute
basics for a pretty cute price so would
recommend oh look at this really funky
fabric I love it okay so another one
that kept coming up that you guys wanted
me to review with Aliexpress which I
actually order off of all the time it's
kind of like this like sketch Chinese
website but I love it too so here are
the things that uh I got off there I've
been really into tweed suits lately just
because you know I love the Chanel vibe
but okay where this little suit to
beautycon you can see it there I don't
know why I looks so dark in this oh like
look fun this little Chanel ass tweed
suit is so cute you can see like the
little frills and whatever and it was
like 40 bucks
Express as cheap as hell so it's a great
bargain hunters dream aka my literally
so cute look the only thing is um if
you're gonna go ahead and order one of
these definitely go a size up because as
you can see they're way too small dang
it but it's okay I can DIY that to make
it fit
real quick future video idea mm-hmm stay
tuned I also got this beautiful outfit
no I'm kidding
I mean I'm not kidding but this looks
really crazy because I didn't fold it so
let me just try this on for you real
quick oh well how funny is this I was
actually totally copy and Kourtney
Kardashian with this one but um this was
actually a dupe of something from Zara I
just thought it was super fun like you
can see it's very like floral tropical
pajama wear but also kind of sexy at the
same time they came pretty quickly to
like usually they take a host up to a
month to come from that far away to the
US but honestly these took only like ten
days each so uh that was really lucky
for me but you know give or take they'll
come eventually
speaking of Zara okay don't laugh I know
this is ridiculous but Oh what is it I
don't know but it looked so good she
inspired I was just living a great life
it's like a literally a floor-length the
golden robe and I just loved it so I
copped it why not
Versace from the floor except that's not
for Sachi Zara and it looks more like
Gucci anyway amber dancing in her mirror
the musical and now to my favorite topic
of all shoes I freaking love shoes I'm a
firm believer that you can never have
too many so why not order a bunch more
so these are the three pairs of shoes
that I got this week um these I just am
dying over they're so cute of RAD
company called Lulu sent them to me and
you can see look at this it has like
bedazzled lipstick and stuff on it and
they're actually made by Jessica Simpson
which is so did you guys hear that my
stomach just growled so loudly
but anyways okay so yeah I just thought
these were like the funnest things ever
by the way Jessica Simpson just like
starting a billion-dollar company of
cool clothes definitely on my mood
to sell stay tuned you guys so many of
you sent these in DMS on Instagram so I
had to cop a pair look at this oh my
gosh literally so fun and also to go
along with them a bunch of you tagged me
in this one Instagram too so I thought I
would just show you the real deal and
look at those bad babies killing the
game oh love it extra on the streets
extra in the sheets and even more extra
on the feets
let's make it a thing you guys I also
thought I would order from some really
random websites that no one's ever heard
of before I'm just kidding I figured it
wouldn't be a video if I didn't talk
about forever 21 so I would I haven't
got some denim bunch of you guys asked
about this when I put it on my Instagram
story um this is it Oh denim is so hot
this season but yeah this is literally
from forever 21 I just like kind of
pulled the jacket off the shoulder and
paired it with a little matching denim
flare skirt kind of like a school girl
but like denim styles so super cute
loved it I don't know why I'm not
wearing shoes but you know whatever
who does this excite you as much as it
excites me hopefully the last and final
placement I got stuff from was a groovy
little Australian boutique that I've
shopped at for years finally started
sending me things so thank you mesh key
boutique um I will show you all of the
fab things all right now whoo you almost
can't see me it's all white in here but
um yeah this little white t-shirt with
this little Kylie Jenner inspired corset
belt thing was from them this was cheap
too it was only like 30 bucks I think so
super fun little cash outfit Lacey
bodysuit I was wearing earlier it's from
there as is uh these two photos in my
Instagram that I love love loved and so
is this and not to brag but a Jennifer
Lopez little reward the same dress one
time so not gonna lie I feel like a
superstar ooh glitter Queen at your
