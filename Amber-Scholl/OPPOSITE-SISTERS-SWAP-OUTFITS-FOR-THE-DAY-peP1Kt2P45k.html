sister Alyssa we grew up the best of
friends truth and started out wearing
all the same clothes when we were kids
but as soon as we could dress ourselves
we went all the way different very much
so yeah very different very different I
love to dress super girly fancy sparkly
and over-the-top and I like to dress
like a dinosaur or a boy just you know
comfort is key so today we thought it'd
be funny to swap outfits for the day and
see what life is like living in each
other's shoes literally so without
further ado here we go opposite sister
swap outfits for the day yeah this is
gonna be good
okay so I'm gonna go first I'm gonna
pick out something for Alissa now like I
said my style is usually really fabulous
over-the-top like you can see um my
outfit of the day today oh I've got like
