California rosamma bouncing California
easy when we ride hey guys i'm amber and
welcome to Pepperdine University aka the
greatest College in the world
aka my alma mater woohoo go Pat um so
today I'm going to give you what I
always wish I had when I was a
prospective student which is a tour of
the campus as given by someone who
actually goes here so I'm gonna take you
around I'll show you the CAF the dorms
everything you ever needed to know to
help you make your decision so here we
go okay so here is what we call main
campus which first of all is beautiful
but second of all this is where you'll
probably see the most hub around
Pepperdine so here we have um a little
outside tables this is something called
the sandbar I'll show you that in a
second
but um we have a little coffee shop here
I guess it's more of a coffee stand but
oh my gosh this is just so beautiful to
you more beautiful than I remember
sidenote look at this I do remember this
the view here again Wow the sunsets are
unbelievable from here by the way if
you're ever just bored studying amazing
alright so here we go this is a science
building so any science classes you will
have in there I didn't like take any
because I was a comm major but this is
Pepperdine main campus it's a bummer
that this isn't on right now but this is
a beautiful fountain that looks
fantastic so maybe when that's turned on
later I'll show you but this is the
infamous mr. George poplar on you can't
do a tour video of Pepperdine and not
include this guy this is the famous
George Pepperdine statue sitting on this
bench me and him
this is the sandbar which is where we
house our Jamba Juice which is so fun to
have on campus so there we go there's
that you can get whatever you want also
where we have a laptop kind of station
have all the computers out and oh looks
like today we're having a blood drive so
this is not normal at all but I guess
today it is this is where we keep all of
our mail so you can get your mail
delivery here the mailboxes are really
hard to open though fYI I couldn't do it
all for years I went here so yeah all
right there we go all right so one thing
you need to know about Pepperdine is
there is lots and lots of stairs here um
so your ass will be looking fantastic
the freshman 15
100% does not exist here but all right
here we go we will walk up from the
chapel to the CAF Oh could you just see
look at how beautiful this is
this is a building um you have a lot of
classes Mary of humanities and stuff all
the luxury tech classes are in there so
I'll show you that in a minute but first
one of the first things people always
ask me about is the food so I actually
love the food on campus this is nature's
edge this is like the little organic
cafe we have on campus all sorts of fun
little things so we got all sorts of
healthy stuff for you guys to eat um I
always ate here because it's slightly
healthier than the CAF and with all
sorts of fun like organic options look
at all this
and of course you're not so healthy
options but are delicious so yeah we got
all of this done said some natural
organic gluten-free if you have any food
allergies we've got everything you ever
wanted in here so you should be good to
go all right here we go
this is the official CAF the waves cafe
here we go
mmm this is a quick little we got some
food over here this is what the CAF
looks like tada tada alright so yeah
we'll show you a little bit of the food
here and we have the team the station
they always have a vegetarian section so
if you're a vegetarian like me no
worries you're good to go we have a
Froyo machine which if you know me you
know this is my favorite thing in the
world but unfortunately is out of order
today or I would totally get some but we
got this stuff right here to our right
and of course it was lots of people in
the way today
like gluten-free options always looking
to keep all the dietary restrictions
healthy salad bar we've got the grill
over here soup a sandwich station and of
course who doesn't want a bunch of
cereal so this is the CAF but my
favorite place to go if you walk right
outside of here hi is La Brea bakery
which is a famous bakery out here in
California um so here we go LaBrea and
they have all sorts of gourmet and the
lighting here is poopy right now but
here we go alright so yeah they have
like gourmet salads and sandwiches and
you can customize your order too
so in mr. Starbucks coffee no which is
pretty cool alright guys so here we go
this is the cast and we'll show you the
view outside because it's unbelievable
as you can already kind of see check
this out
whoa like this is why I decided to come
here honestly was when I ate lunch here
for the first time check it out a full
ocean view amazing amazing amazing
this never gets old by the way I went
here for full four years and every time
I looked out I almost wanted to cry it
was so pretty easy to get dorm row
confused with a luxury hotel but in fact
this is where the freshmen live all
lined along these houses there's main
campus over there but this is where the
dorms are so you can see also we have
our tennis courts down there in the
baseball team over there so this is not
the worst view ever to live your first
year living out of your house all right
we'll go inside in a sec but for now dad
said I'm okay so I know what you guys
are really dying to see is what the
freshman dorms look like because no one
will show you that but I found someone
who's nice enough to let me go inside
her dorm so here we go let's go hey so
this is the house that we're going to go
into this is one of the freshmen girls
dorms so this is developed here we go as
you can see it's kind of situated like a
house with an amazing view sand
volleyball courts in front of this one
whoo there's ocean back there
all right here we go dorm number one
here we go okay so this is one of the
freshmen girl dorms as you can see they
decorated it so cute this one is called
the Belle
I'm not really sure how many exactly
there are but this is how and each suite
style house is organized this is like
the main lobby area of one of them as
you can see this one has a great view we
have the beach volleyball court right in
front and of course the ocean over there
such a beautiful day so we have all
sorts of fun decorations destination
home
boom damn there's a fireplace a lot of
times they'll have all of your like
sweet housing activities up in here so
they'll have little craftsman and fun
little activities movie watching on the
TV man who travels the world in search
of what he needs and returns on what
okay well anyways I'm sure this is deep
and cute but okay so here we go
okay so I'm happy 9 how the dorms work
is there houses of dorms and there's all
girls houses and all boys houses we are
in an all-girl house called the Bell and
this is you can kind of see the lobby
here in the background I'll switch the
angle in a second but this one like I
said is the girls one it's all girls
living in the house and then next to us
would be a boys dorm which is all boys
living there and then the next one is
all girls again so kind of alternates
and you have like a partner dorm so I
lived in Crocker personally I'm in ours
with J 10 was one next door to us so
that doesn't mean anything to you now
but it will if you come here so like I
said yeah they're organized like that
and in each house there will be sweet so
there will be like a sweet be sweet be
sweet and within the sweet there will be
rooms of two people each so each sweet
if you're following will have five rooms
of two people in them so it's about ten
girls living in a studio together or no
it's eight girls I think it's eight
girls living in a suite but so yeah
that's how that works
and Kevin the other questions I know the
dorm situation sounds kind of confusing
but feel free to comment below and I'll
always respond to all the comments
openly and honestly so here we go inside
here we go we are going to now go in to
the suite which works like this so there
will be that's the main area and then
this is where each of the little houses
are set up so we'll come inside and like
I said it's setup into sweet so sweet b
e and f ER up this way bum bum bum bum
and we had someone take me in to be
sweet so here we go so here we go this
is a suite and this is this look Avery
and Darren Darren's room so thank you
guys oh my gosh you guys decorated this
so cute okay so this is what the
freshman dorms look like
a little different just because of we
probably different furniture than like
everyone else oh really yeah I didn't
have this furniture I came here ours was
like really ugly I actually kind of like
this um but yeah okay so you can see all
your DG cool um thank you you're so nice
to let me film your room but oh here we
go here's a nice mirror huh guys okay so
as you can see they're not super big but
they're not super small either um and
they always have really nice ocean views
some of them if you're lucky enough to
get those but this is what it looks like
it comes with all the furniture it'll
have the bed it'll have the chairs what
aren't like the greatest looking chairs
in the world but you know what can you
do
so yeah and you can fat do fun ideas to
make it your own as you can see this is
super cute so got the whole little room
right here tuts ah alright so I'll show
you guys the suite and like everything
else but this is what the dorm looks
like we'll do one more view because I
know this is so important to you guys
when you're making your decisions tada
tada
by the way all the dorms are two people
so you'll have one bed you can bunk the
beds up to so and this is the carpet
oh they change the carpet since I went
here as well yeah hasn't Brandon yeah
this is nice but a rug you can do
whatever you want and comes with fridges
if you order one I think they're like
fifty bucks a year or something um yeah
alright so there you go I'll show you
the rest in a sec this is what the main
suite area looks like so they actually
decorated this one super cute I've never
been in here before until just now but
here we go
so we have the main window and then you
have the main room it usually comes with
couches and this little table so you can
decorate them however you want but me
and my suitemates all made ours like
pink and crazy because we were super
girly but as you can see you can
literally do whatever so these are all
the rooms and it's great alright so here
again I know this is important to you
these are the bathrooms which if you
keep clean can be just fine most of the
suites come with him here um again hi
and so we will have a bathroom right
here
it usually I think what is the suite
yeah this these suites have two two
bathrooms I mean it's one giant bathroom
but they have two toilets in them and
then they have but this one has two
showers too I think so we can see the
shower they have really nice high water
pressure too by the way
so very nice showers considering this is
a dorm and by the way the best part
about this is that oh and this one's
even cooler this one has like a little
glass door so that's fun but the best
part about Pepperdine is that they have
a maid service and I'm not kidding when
I say that literally they have maids
come in and clean your bathroom and
clean your dorm for you like twice a
week so they take out the trash it's
amazing it's kind of like a best-kept
secret till you get here they'll even do
your laundry for you for a small fee so
take advantage of that if you can
alright continuing okay this is the hawk
aka the Howard a white sucker but
everyone calls it the hawk this is where
you can get some late nuts necks and
hang out there's like a ping-pong table
and fun shenanigans in here so here we
go see that but upstairs is the fun part
hmm like I said there's a lot of stairs
here so excuse me for being winded but
here we go
a lot of students hang out up here as
you can see they're all in their natural
habitat unwillingly being in my video
um but yeah it's like a mini other
little calf in here
oh we're not allowed to film sorry guys
okay so this is Payson library I have to
always spur because otherwise I'll get
in trouble but this is where you guys
can study all sorts of books and stuff
in here computer um so yeah it's really
cool
like I said I gotta be quiet but we have
every book that you would ever imagine
in here plus a couple more all right so
yeah there we go fun place to study
needless to say I didn't do too much
studying when I was here super random
but we have an amazing study abroad
program so this is a wall leading into
the CAF and I will show you the second
but this is a map of all of the places
that we can study abroad where is Liz ah
here we go I studied here in Lausanne it
was unbelievable I visited all the
houses and it was so so cool and but
we've a DC program a London program
Heidelberg LaVon
yay by the way you literally have a view
of the Swiss Alps if you go to Livan so
it was unbelievable and we also Florence
but it was so so fun so this is the
International Programs office
most people go there sophomore year and
you can stay for six months or the whole
year but tons of fun all right there you
go there's my little over on she'll
continuing on to the bookstore all right
so this is the bookstore where you can
get all your Pepperdine swag to fun
I literally obviously have a lot of it
because a I'm into fashion and B I'm
also kind of lazy so wearing sweatshirts
and sweatpants all the time is really
fun to me so you can get all sorts of
things in here and if you're ever in
need if the CAF does not suffice for you
anything you ever needed it's like our
own little personal CBS in here um we
have everything you ever needed
including late-night snug study snacks
nutty snacks what the heck is blat and
you know anything you might have
forgotten when you were packing to come
to college safety pins god I can't even
tell you how many times I've been in
here because I forgot like lotion or
something so yeah it's lots of fun
school supplies oh yes by the way this
is where you get all of your textbooks
too so
if you want to spend a fortune on your
textbooks get them here include a link
at the bottom to get them for cheaper
but there you go
all right continuing onward all right so
you might recognize this from quite a
few famous people's instagrams but this
is the Pepperdine University Chapel and
let's see if it's locked or not can I
get in today oh we're in look alright
here we go this is the chapel it's
beautiful isn't it Wow lots of good
times in here umm so this is where a lot
of people get married but I mean not
like Pepperdine students I mean like you
know people actually getting married but
whatever it's just stunning in here you
can come in and worship as you please
though you absolutely do not have to um
this is just a resource for students on
campus if they so wish to utilize it
it's miss amazing Wow alright that's
enough of this oh okay
so there you go that's the chapel
continuing onward okay so this is
Firestone Fieldhouse which doubles as
our Athletic Center and also as our
convocation centers so people always ask
if Pepperdine forces you to go to church
the answer is no but we do have
something called convocation which if
you have any questions about please feel
free to ask in the comments I will
answer them all but this is where we
have that every Wednesday so I don't
know if I'm allowed to go in here but
I'm gonna try peep it really quick on
some practice let's see oh yeah look at
this
Oh totally I can come in here look at
look at our gym how amazing is it
so cool all sorts of stuff when the
stands are oh you know what you might
recognize it because um Drake did attend
a basketball game here once so we're
kind of a big deal okay okay but these
are the infamous CCB stairs and it just
wouldn't be Pepperdine if I didn't show
you these so up we go all right so this
is where I lived the Center for I'm
super widget I hope the stairs is so
embarrassing
Wow um okay so the Center for
communication and business this means
anything in the comm division or the
business department all of your classes
or most of your major classes Jesus will
be up here my major was broadcasting can
you tell so I'll show you a little too
urban
all right so this is the CCD oh my god
all right here we go this is
embarrassing I need to go the gym more
all right so here we go CC be a little
study area in here and we're going to
see if I can take us inside one of the
classrooms here's what one of the
classrooms up in the ccd looks like got
the whiteboard
got everything most of them have an
ocean view I'm sorry this one does not
but most of the class sizes here are
pretty small too usually about 10 to 15
kids at class so you get a lot of
hands-on learning alrighty there you
have it a fun little gallery of all the
famous people who went to Pepperdine and
all their awards you might recognize a
Tia &amp;amp; Tamera Mallory went here so that's
kind of cool
all right so apologies my camera is
about to die so I'm just sitting in my
car but that's the tour I hope you had
fun if I missed anything or you've any
questions at all about literally
anything just comment below I'd be happy
to answer them or if you want to do it

shoal I will answer anything at all you
want to know so feel free to ask away um

experience of my whole life I loved
every second of it and being back here
