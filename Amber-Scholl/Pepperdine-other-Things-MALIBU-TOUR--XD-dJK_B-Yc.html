theater right here oh and a nice
friendly stranger that's another cool
thing about um Albus everyone here is

it's really Pleasant people like that
lady just let us play with her dog for
so long but anyways like I said back to
to where there is a Chipotle over here
there's also a movie theater if you want
to see some movies
like I said this is maybe two minutes
down the street from Pepperdine so it's
a really good time all right
continuing on okay all right guys um now
me and the SIS we're going to go to the
closest beach um usually if you want to
really spend the whole day at the beach
you go to Zuma Beach was about which is
about like 15 minutes down the road but
today we're going to go to like the
secret beach everyone calls it Ralph's
speech
she's hamming it up this is my video No
okay guys obviously she's wait okay well
we'll give her a second sorry our mom is
also gonna follow us um but I'm gonna
tell you so like I said we're about to
go to Ralph's speech um it is literally
right behind the brows if you drive down
the street where it's like a private
beach but I spend a lot of time studying
there and it's a great little place so
I'm gonna show ya here we go as you can
see um you just drive straight down this
road it's right behind Ralph's I'll put
a full link in my blog and all the
addresses and everything to plug in to
get here but then you'll just park on
the side of the street here and oops I
don't get run over yeah what this says
welcome to the beach you go in I know
but I need where you need all right
where are you going okay anyways there
will be a sign here that says welcome to
the beach and you can just open it and
go right down here at your very own
private beach villa woo Oh check it out
you guys this is just the most
incredible place to come when you're
studying or if you just want to hang out
oh my god the ocean looks unbelievable
today and there you go with like your
own little private beach villa
um because like I said this is
technically a private beach for the
people who live in these mega mansions
right here but for the purposes of
Pepperdine students it is your beach -
okay so we have
it's comin up mostly because I wanted to
vlog it but also because I wanted to
trick her to somewhere cool so here we
go check this place out
alright here we go guys this is Nobu one
of my all-time favorite restaurants um
if you're ever in town please take me
here but just look at this view off the
patio it is unbelievable one of my fav
of all time so if you have a couple
pennies to spare come here for dinner
it's amazing all right it's freezing but
I got memorized once you're done um so
we are at Zuma Beach again this is a
beach that's about 15 20 minutes
um north of Pepperdine towards Oxnard
but it is super fun I know we all look
crazy it's freezing because it gets cold
so always make sure you have a sweater
just because it's California it doesn't
mean that you will be hot all the time
but this is Uma Beach I just wanted to
show you so here we go
I know yes okay it's cold mama here we
go my mom doesn't like me cause it's
pretty though Bob that's all though oh
look at this
yes that's super nice um so yeah this is
Zuma Beach way bigger than the Ralph's
speech I'm like I sense a little further
so I don't usually come here but if you
want to spend the whole day at the beach
um zoom has a great spot to come you
guys very majestic sans art but it
didn't really come out as I thought it
was gonna come up but I tried it's the
thought that counts
XO
alright now you just drive down the
street about 15 minutes thanks for
showing me around the mother um which
isn't really the worst Drive in the
world I mean look at this this isn't
even the prettiest section of the road
um but you will hit Santa Monica so that
is where i'm gonna take you next alright
guys welcome to Santa Monica I again
brought the whole crew with me got the
whole fam but we are also featuring
message or boyfriend today um also sign

the same thing every day no I guess I
could have anyways you're relevant here
we go Santa Monica all right so this is
3rd Street Promenade this is like the
main mall area but this is an awesome
place to go shopping I'll show you the
Main Street in a second but lots of food
lots of shops and right next to the
beach and the pier is super close to so
I'll walk you there in a minute alright
so here is the Main Street um also we
have my whole fam again we got Angie and
ELISA and my mom and I'm bringing the
crew um so yeah this is 3rd Street
Promenade like I said lots of
restaurants it's always poppin
especially in the summer Oh lots of
people on bikes and of course lots of
cute quality dogs but this is so fun um
you just walk around and spend the day
here so definitely recommended you check
it out if you walk down a little further
past 3rd Street um and you just walk to
the end you can see here a very famous
landmark that I am actually too lazy to
walk to but is quite fun especially at
night here's the same emmonak appear
down there you guys PC it'll zoom in for
you
yeah it's just right there throwback to
the Hannah Montana movie I know how
something like that's what I think of
you can just walk down to the beach
right there - that's PCH yeah so Tatsu
Demonica for you
all right so this is the big shopping
mall through the Canyon in Calabasas
this is Topanga Westfield it's a great
mall very fancy good for shopping so
this is the inside it's a really really
nice mall there is tons of super cute
in contrast very inexpensive stores that
are awesome I'll include a link in the
bottom some of the ones I recommend
granted I'm going to be recommending I
guess girl stores because I've never
really shopped for a boy in my life but
you're great if you want to come check
it out this is definitely where you want
to come for shopping so enjoy the mall
guys all right now if you come through
the canyon this is one of the most
adorable little shopping centers oh look

Calabasas Commons and it looks so so
cute at night I just love it here
there's a lot of cute stores a lot of
cute restaurants there's actually
marmalades over here and they also have
a Sun Life I'll take you there in the
mornings I'm gonna get an acai bowl um
yeah it's just so adorable it's a great
place to come walk around super fun for
dates if you're the kind of person who
is lucky enough to have a romantic life
like this is just the cutest place I'm
walking around here by myself now
because everyone else was too tired and
went to bed um
so alright my favorite thing about
Calabasas though is this this is the
best movie theater ever you guys may
recognize this because you know I'm a
big fan of Kim and Kanye but this is
where they see the movies it is just the
cutest little theater you can see it's
super nice in there and yeah there's
also there's a Sephora there's a bunch
of restaurants and other Barnes &amp;amp; Noble
oh and a Mac apparently but it's a super
fun place to come at especially like I
said at night
