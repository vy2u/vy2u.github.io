back to my channel um so as you can see
uh I'm still in the process of
redecorating my room but it is going to
be done soon so I can't wait to show you
guys that when it's done but for now I
promised you guys that I would make a
Q&amp;amp;A video so here it is I'm gonna answer
a couple questions bust out my phone and
see what it is you guys wanted to know
so here we go alright here we go first
question what is your nationality okay
so I'm asked this question literally all
the time on Instagram um I'm actually
Russian German a little Irish a little
polish basically 50 shades of white just
your average white girl some of you
asked what my name was I don't know why
Oh my middle name is Brittany maybe
that's what you meant I'm just like
Britney Spears but spelled TTA and why
so just like Harbour twins oops
ah tada where do I live guys I live in
Los Angeles the greatest city in the
world in my humble opinion um no it's so
fun here but yeah I live in LA with my
two best friends super fun love them
they'll be in a video at some point if I
can ever convince them to be in one but
they don't like this sort of thing so
how old are you I'm 23 um I'm a Leo so
my birthday's August 13th actually born
on a Friday the 13th um if you care but
I always believed that 13 is my lucky
number
what's your family like oh my feelings
the cutest ever my mom and dad have been
married for like 25 years I'm still in
love so cute I'll show you guys a
picture of them in a second on here and
then I also two little sisters ELISA and
Angie they're not so little anymore
they're 18 and 21 and they're the best
ever my little sister actually alyssa
has been dating the same boy for like
three years and they're so cute I'm
always stirred wheeling with them which
I don't even mind but there they are you
recognize them from all my snapchats
probably of them making out and be just
sitting there so oh yeah what kind of
camera do you have it's great the
quality is amazing uh yeah I know I
agree it's a canon g7x um I'm filming on
it right now so I can't show it to you
but it's awesome it's like the best
vlogging camera all the youtubers have
it so that's why I got it watched a
bunch of videos and I was like this
seems like the camera for me I also
use it to take my soldiers on Instagram
because it's a great point shoot camera
- I think I'll do a full review on the
camera soon but that's a great camera to
get if you're looking to get one do you
believe in astrology hell yeah I'm a Leo
to the tee
I love reading my horoscope even though
it's kind of dumb like I will literally
read anything like what muffin are you
according to your astrology sign I'll
get like excited over being blueberry
like so dumb but I love reading that
sort of thing um I don't know it's just
fun why not
what is your most embarrassing story why
would say I wouldn't tell my most
embarrassing story on the Internet
but I've already told lots of
embarrassing stories of the internet so
I'm a side of my mortifying date
experience earlier this year um I
actually threw up on my crush in
kindergarten I got so nervous talking to
him so Kyle Smith if you're out there
I'm sorry about that
we never ended up dating granted we were
like 7 years old but you know oh god
this is a good one man what is the most
financially irresponsible thing you've
ever done let me tell you guys you're
talking to the most financially
irresponsible human being on planet
Earth
um but I think Oh God so many things I
could say for this um but I think the
number one has got to be um I bought a
crystallized trash can that was like a
hundred dollars before I even got paid
mind you I you a paycheck was coming in
the mail and before it even arrived I
spent $100 on this diamond-encrusted
trashcan oh I think that was pretty dumb
um if that's not like a really weird
metaphor for my life I I don't know what
is already I'm not sure what is gonna
direct if you could travel anywhere
where would you go oh I might have been
pretty lucky to travel a lot um I
studied abroad in Switzerland which was
really cool so I've been all over Europe
but I think I could go anywhere I would
love to go to Iceland and see the
Northern Lights because I've been on my
bucket list forever um not to mention
that like blue look
water thing looks so cool favorite food
uh my hands down ice cream no question
no contest it's been my favorite forever
I have been known to eat frozen yogurt
for breakfast sometimes um don't tell my
trainer that but yeah hope they don't
watch this do you have any hidden
talents do I even have any not hidden
talents
I can do this with my tongue does that
count as a talent I can't even do it
that good so no I guess not
he mentioned one time on your Instagram
that you're a vegetarian yes this is not
really a question but yes I am um I have
been a vegetarian for almost five years
now um yeah it's great I love it people
always ask how the hell you stay
vegetarian you don't spend two terrian
french fries cake pizza like there's so
many think the only thing you can't eat
is meat so I eat a lot of not meat are
you married am i married it's like the
joke of the century no I'm not married
um no I'm not dating anyone I'm single
I'm ready too bingo I just don't really
think I'll that good so that's why I'm
sitting here alone on a Saturday night
don't don't make this pitiful do you
have any pets I wish I had a pet I used
to have a fish named Dairy Queen but she
passed away on my birthday this year
actually that was so sad I grew up with
a dog and Maxon at home with Arizona and
then also a pet bird named Sweet Pea uh
any he lives with my parents but so I
guess no pets in the immediate vicinity
I'm all alone womp
how are you I'm a little lady buddy baby
minute I'm five three um but that's okay
a lot of great people were short you
know
I can't think of anyone right now but I
promise you there are awesome short
people in the world
um else do you won't know do you have a
job or do you just sit at home all day
and take pictures ah okay so ya know I
don't really have a nine-to-five I'm
lucky enough that I do get to do social
media for a living so that's really fun
I run all my own personal accounts which
doesn't really pay me that much but I do
run a couple company accounts too so
that is what pays my rent
so yes I am lucky enough to just sit at
home and take pictures all day celebrity
crush oh my god you guys um I could go
on and on about this but embarrassingly
enough I love boy bands even though I
just told you I'm 23 I stay loving one
direction Harry Styles is my number one
and has been my number one since day one
I also really love Trey Songz um he's my
number two so if any of you out there
know either of them focused uh what was
your major at Pepperdine um saw your
video loved it thank you
sweepy um so I Pepperdine I majored in
broadcast journalism because I love
talking so I thought that was a fun easy
major which guess what it was what was
your first job oh god um my first job is
actually a hostess at a restaurant and I
was really bad at it I always got yelled
at by my boss who was like this giant a
400-pound man with a red beard that was
like this long so that was just a mess
you said once on your snapchat you dye
your hair at home what brand of hair
berry dye do you use I do dye my hair at
home uh john frieda color natural black
it's like the perfect Kardashian black
so yeah there you go something that we
might not ever guess about you um
I don't know this is hard uh I wear my
socks inside out on purpose probably
wouldn't have guessed that and I don't
know why I thought of that just now but
yeah I don't know the little line on the
socks bothers me so I will wear them
inside out on purpose what was your
first concert this is so embarrassing uh
I do
go to a concert until freshman year of
college and it was Kesha and LMFAO it
was great though I loved it loved it
now I've been to a lot more concerts but
I still kind of had trash taste in music
um so speaking of someone else at some
point I remember reading that I wanted
to know what kinda music I like ah
favorite music is like I said boy hands
um but I love pop ariana grande Taylor
Swift Kanye West um and you know generic
blatant pop music Justin Bieber's got
7,000 jams that I love so if you went
through my Spotify you would not really
be impressed with my cultured music
taste but I guarantee you it'd be a bomb
what's your favorite color
pink white gold Sparkle is sparkle of
color sparkles my favorite diamond what
is your favorite movie oh you guys a
father of the bride part one and two
collectively are my favorite movie I've
loved them forever I have like such a
weird crush on Steve Martin it doesn't
make any sense
he's like 75 but that is my all-time
favorite movie I probably watched it
seven thousand times
in fact I'm probably gonna watch it when
I stop filming this you have any tattoos
nope Todd feel free if I ever got one I
totally I mean I'm not opposed to it I
love guys with tattoos I just don't know
what I would put I'm like so indecisive
I would probably end up getting like a
butterfly on my arm and then hate it in
like two days how do you deal with hate
on the Internet
um yeah a lot of people aren't that nice
um and you know what you're just gonna
let it roll off your back usually I'll
screenshot it because it's at least
makes me chuckle because some of the
things I get are just so ridiculous um
so I will just let it roll off my back
because you know what can't touch this
pirating interview I don't know what
interested in all seriousness though and
I don't know I mean I kind of grew up
actually not that confident of a person
so at this point it's just like if you
want to try and knock me down I've built
up and brockhard sense of self but I
know that a little comment on the
internet won't bother me so if you want
to say something ridiculous to me I
would just let it slide
positive vibes only people all right you
guys there you have it um there is
actually not even just the let's say a
little bit more but there's a lot more
than you ever even wanted to know about
me probably but um there you go
if you have any other questions let me
know it's nice to meet you guys and I
want to get to know you too so comment
below some facts about you um I love to
pee friends so I guess that's it for now
I will see you soon on my next videos
let me know what you want me to film
because I will do it um and for now guys
kiss until next time again all my
socials at amber shoal so follow me
tweet me snap me slide into my DMS
whatever you want to do as always thanks
so much for watching um and it was nice
talking to you
even though I can't really hear you guys
I know you're listening that doesn't
make any sense
anyways kiss until next time you guys
