existential crisis I've recently
developed a crush on post Malone and I
can't stop thinking about it like Jesus
what is this anyways what is up you guys
it's amber welcome back to my channel
and today we are doing one of my
favorite things a bunch of you guys
suggested that I do a shopping challenge
where I only shop in the sales section
so guess what we're gonna do it after
all you don't need to break the bank to
look fab that's practically like the
tagline of my old channel so without
further ado here we go a dairy sales
section a shopping spree
Brooke bitch style
all right as always before we get going
here their outfit of the day um this is
actually just like a really cute little
oversized jean jacket with a matching
denim skirts at some place called mesh
key I liked it below of course bling
ring nation and for shoes oh we're
actually gonna do a story time I'm gonna
cry these we sell online for like two
grand so when I saw some girl listed
them worn once at $300 I bought those
real quick so these are my new children
I literally can't believe they're mine
and while we're on the topic of getting
banger deals a bunch of you guys had
asked about the shoes from my lookbook
the other day these are the real centi
by Rihanna pumps actually got these
boots forever ago using an app called
shop tagger so when they reached out to
me to partner on a video I was like oh
my god I love you guys yes so it's
basically a shopping app that tells you
when things you want goes on sale I'll
show you guys on the desktop site here
so I can see better but all you have to
do is go to the shop tagger website on
google chrome and then in the corner
right here it says get the button go
ahead click on that and install it then
once it's all set up you can just go to
any of your favorite websites well go to
Neiman Marcus for shoes here today and
then you can go ahead and type in
whatever it is that you're looking for
Fenty puma then once you find what
you're looking for you can go ahead and
see in the corner there there's the
little shop tagger button we just
installed you can click on that and this
will come up you can pick the color the
size when to get notified and then you
can hit save and it will be saved right
here to your profile like you can see
here it's actually saved twice because I
bought these already but this is my
shoeless of dream shoes I'm waiting for
sale notifications on so now whenever
any of those things go on sale I get
notified and I come by on the link to
download it is in the description so
major shout out to stop tiger for
sponsoring this video y'all are the real
MVP for helping us save some money so on
that note let's actually go shopping
alrighty so we're starting our journey
out at the Grove and we're going to
start here because well why not
oh-ho this is what I'm talking about
the sale in here is huge right now oh my
god we literally hit the sale jackpot
okay let's see what we can find
ooh these are cool I'm so easily
distracted
okay anyways we got some stuff let's try
it on hmm I look like a weird pilgrim
well he's a little bit cool but uh
that's it that's as far up as they go oh
my god this is amazing
alrighty we're gonna pop into the shoe
section at Nordstrom because JK they
said there's no sales right now so I
guess that's a bust in here
alrighty maybe we can try this place oh
yeah this is what I'm talking about
this Valentino blazer is one thousand
eight hundred and fourteen dollars huh
as far as I'm concerned if something is
still over a thousand dollars it is not
on sale alrighty so we are hitting up
the Beverly Center so let's see what
kind of troubles we can take out oh I
like the looks of this
oh my goodness you guys look perfect
dupes of my new shoes let's see what
else have we got there ooh these are
beauties look at these so fun I feel
like I'm in the 70s now these are
beauties look at these funky shoes oh my
goodness okay boom they're like
Sasquatch feet honestly I kind of
freaking love them these are literally
crazy oh my god
this is amazing you can see these
puppies are on sale but it's still 80
bucks so we're gonna continue on the
sale house party those enough shoes for
now let's try some clothes we're gonna
investigate what this store has to offer
clearance
well well well don't mind if I do these
are kind of fun I wish these were the
ones on sale though all righty let's see
um I guess this first this will be kind
of pretty if I had somewhere to go but
also it's too big hmm this track is very
interesting I actually kind of dig it
and look at that we should get in a
bigger deal where to next
don't mind if I do hmm oh we're in the
men's section great no I'm kidding we'll
go to the girls section oh yeah we have
located the sale rack let's see - oh
these are cute the only thing I don't
like about the sales section is a lot of
time they don't have things in your size
which is that nothing is crawling to me
in here ah except the Justin Bieber to
emerge which of course is not on sale
Justin why is your stuff not on sale hmm
you buzz killing my video
it's okay you're forgiven okay so back
to shopping actually this stuff is kind
of cool this looks very Harry style desk
ooh and this is a beautiful color what
Heidi's on it ooh I wanted this to be a
dress I think it's a little short for
that this fabric is actually really
pretty but the fit is like super weird
and boxy so
such a nice sign kinda hard to read but
it says forget the rules if it makes you
happy to wear it for its tulip site
alrighty we have now arrived at the
fanciest store ever you know I'm just
kidding but this is a very cool store
and they just told me everything is 25%
off yay
look at how sparkly everything is you
know me I love subtlety oh my god you
guys this is my favorite sake we do sale
shopping to be this fun alright good ol
forever 21 always coming through so
let's see what we've got in here where
even is the sale section in here huh it
is literally so hard for me to stay
focused in here ok what were they doing
oh yes sale Wow oh I feel so welcome
alrighty let's brave the forest there's
literally so much stuff I don't even
know where to start well this doesn't
fit how I anticipated
look mom no pants I didn't really think
about how weird nude leggings with me
this is such a strange look
well guys head of all of this for one
forever21 fails me alrighty so since
everything else has been failing lately
let's try and get some underwear here we
go so what I'm talking about
hmm I got some really slim pickins here
today where is all the good stuff
actually that's a stupid question I know
exactly where it is over here
we're home right
like these are so cute this is just not
my day for shopping what is this
alright sigh next door
woo I just love the floors in here
alright let's see Bloomingdale's can you
save the day you know my only problem
with sales and nice stores is I mean
that's great that it's marked down so
much but why was it eight hundred and
seventy five dollars to begin with what
oh my god I did not realize how long
I've been shopping look at this it is
literally night 9:30 effect so uh-huh I
really got to work on my shopping time
surprise are you guys especially the
next day because you saw I was out like
really late so I didn't want to film a
haul yesterday but are you ready for my
really big exciting hole full of thing
with today mm-hmm womp nothing yeah
believe it or not I shopped for almost
nine hours and bought nothing am I
losing my touch what is this honestly I
think it's because I just did that
closet clean-out video and I saw how
much stuff I had that I didn't wear so I
think I was just hesitant to buy
anything that I wasn't 200 percent sure
about however I did go shopping again
this morning and I went to Nordstrom
Rack and I could just got some
high-waisted black legging things which
are actually super cute I also got this
really cool jean jacket with pearls on
it ooh ooh look at this oh it is
literally so cute they weren't
technically on sale but since that whole
store is on sale I'm gonna go ahead and
say they technically count because this
is my video I make the rules for the
challenge so do you guys that is my sale
