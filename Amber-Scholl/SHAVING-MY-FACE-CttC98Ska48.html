use shaving cream when I do this I just
thought this was the perfect excuse to
play with it ooh so fun anyways what is
up you guys
it's amber welcome back to my channel
and ever since I mentioned that I shaved
my face and one of my older shopping
videos a bunch of you guys have been
asking me to actually film a little mini
tutorial of it so today I figured if
we're just gonna go ahead and do just
that because this is literally what I do
at home alone on Saturday night you guys
think I'm kidding I'm not Oh anyway
without further ado here we go a wild
face shaving evening how I shave my face
all right we're actually gonna bust out
the trusty tripod for this video but
actually you know what I swear if I had
a dollar for every time I had to open a
video explaining I'm actually not bald I
just look bald because my hairstyle oh
yeah I'd have a billion dollars and all
my fake glue the towns would be real I
don't know if this is gonna work out but
we'll see so I did not do this correctly
okay hang on um this is literally so
uneven what okay so this is about the
best that we're gonna get so here we go
all you need for the face shaving
extravaganza is one ingredient this
these are just little face razors you
can get these online anywhere I'm pretty
sure Amazon has them just the teeny tiny
little razor it won't like scratch you
or anything you're fine but there we go
so let me just go ahead and take all of
our makeup off you want to have a nice
clean shiny face for this oh yes look uh
that goodbye makeup mmm-hmm
this looks actually so crazy but you
know whatever all right - yes baby soft
so you can see no more makeup on there
and that's literally all you're gonna do
by the way about you guys always ask why
my face is like such a different color
to my neck I tan my neck don't tan my
face there you go my super short show
boom did anyone catch that reference
probably not cuz it was like a long time
to go but anyway back to the vid
alrighty so the next step is you're just
gonna go ahead and take a hammer and
that's clearly just a joke I just really
didn't want this video to be boring so
trying to make it a little more
interesting if you came here for a real
beauty guru video I'm so sorry okay so
actually the real tutorial now this is
what you really are gonna do you're just
gonna go ahead and take the little razor
and this is so easy like you guys are
gonna be a cook so all you do is um you
can see I'll come a little closer so you
can really see the hair there but you
can kind of see the hair right there so
all we're gonna go ahead and do is take
the razor and facing down and kind of
pull on your skin a little bit just to
make it taut like this and just take it
and brush it down
and that's it that's all you do if I
come really close here you can kind of
see the little baby hairs coming off
like there do you see them you can kind
of do your neck too why not
up close version here bye-bye little
hairs bye bye bye bye you're not wanted
here bye bye thanks for coming by
like there they are and the razor you
can kinda sorta see them so go ahead
blow them off into the wind make a wish
like mm-hmm may Harry Styles randomly DM
me okay I always go ahead and just wipe
it again to make sure that we are all
cleaned up and good to go so there's no
bacteria or anything like you can see
now it's perfectly smooth no more little
hairs baa-eautiful then when I'm done
with the razors they're so cheap I
honestly just throw them away I know you
can keep them and clean them but I just
figured you know better safe than sorry
I just splurged the extra three bucks on
the package I'll just get a new one
every time and then that's literally it
you're all done I don't worry can you
believe it that's all you do it takes
like 30 seconds I do it once or twice a
month and uh then I got baby soft smooth
skin so perfect little at-home beauty
treatment I only do this area right here
I've heard a lot of people like do their
whole face I'm too afraid to do that but
I'm sure it's no big deal because let me
tell you I was terrified to shave my
face the first time and after I did it I
was like oh that's it really I always
get asked the same question whenever I
mentioned this which is does your hair
grow back thicker or darker honestly I
really thought that it would and I have
definitely not noticed that personally
um honestly you just saw my hair I've
been doing this for like about a year
and a half I think and it's totally the
same and that was after I didn't shave
it for like mmm I didn't do it for like
two months I was just really slacking
sometimes I get lazy you know so like I
said definitely not like something you
have to do but if you are ever
interested there you go that's how I do
it yeah that is literally good kids
there you go how I shave my face ooh so
soft I feel like a baby but what I've
actually never felt I just realized but
men don't really want you either so
anyways we'll talk about something else
um actually do you guys want to see
something so cool oh I just bought a
piano oh I forgot I didn't turn it on
but it's so pretty
look at that Wow Beauty no I don't play
piano and I know this has nothing to do
with this video but obviously I just
wanted to make it a little more exciting
if I feel like I can't believe anyone
would really want to watch me shave my
face but you know I guess you did click
on the title so someone must be Ellie
sort of interested I promise I'll do a
whole house to her as soon as it's
actually furnished but currently
basically all I have is oh so stay tuned
for that I hope you guys enjoyed the
video as always if you have any
questions comments concerns uh my
