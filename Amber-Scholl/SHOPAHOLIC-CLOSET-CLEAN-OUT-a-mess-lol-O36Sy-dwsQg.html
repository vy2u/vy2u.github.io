thank God oh really it's cause for
celebration
what is up you guys it's a number
welcome back to my channel and welcome
to huh the party by the way no I'm not
naked I literally just happen to be
wearing a flesh-colored jumpsuit which I
thought was a good idea until I was
editing this so anyways back to the
party do you guys like the bow and the
little I don't even know what you call
this but it was shiny and made noise so
I loved it so today we are having a big
celebration because I am finally doing
something that I've been meaning to do
for a 500 bazillion years cleaning out
my closet I usually do this about once a
year to make room for new fun stuff so
today I'm just gonna go through my
closet to brave the brave the disaster
and see what kind of things I have kind
of like shopping in my own closet but
I'm gonna clean it out sell some of it
to you guys if you want it and um make
some room for some all new shopping haul
this is so without further ado here we
go a very extra big celebration closet
clean out alright so first things first
are you ready to see my closet oh I have
not cleaned it in so long so it's really
quite the disaster but don't kill me mom
but here it is
Dannan are you guys ready for this oh my
beautiful clothes I think you might
recognize for my DIY closet video um
however I haven't really kept it as
clean as I would like mostly because
it's just overflowing so uh oh my god
where do I even start
alright so you guys know I've no
organizational genius my room is only a
mess and my closet you know reflects
that so basically I'm just gonna do the
basics of what I know which is you make
pipes tada
here we go so we've got a giveaway pile
we've got a maybe pile and we've got
this sell pile like I said posh marking
it all you'll see that in a second so
got our three piles which I really
should have written in sharpie so you
could see them better and then no no no
no no no time to deal with the disaster
alright so I'll be honest I have a big
problem with getting rid of things I
love them and I get really attached to
them once I buy them so
we're gonna really really try to channel
this out with the old in with the new
mentality and see if I can actually
clean this out so here we go by the way
if you hear any annoying noise it's
because there's literally a giant
construction project going on outside
very annoying shush anyways good god
okay so honestly I think we're gonna
start with shoes because that'll be a
little easier for me to arraign in but
alas these are not all of my shoes you
guys there's all of these - oops this is
so funny I keep finding new stuff in my
closet just gonna wear something new in
every scene of this video this is
actually so embarrassing I didn't
realize I was such a hoarder but uh yeah
let's go through these babies huh boy
where do I even start
how about with these it took me three
hundred years to go through all them but
wow I found shoes that I loved shoes
that I made shoes I forgot I had my
dicta to shoes I just love them I can't
help it like crazy cat ladies I'm a
crazy shoe lady high heels low heels
everything in between and eventually
three separate piles huh we did it
alrighty so now they've organized them
into the three piles giveaway clothes
going straight into the bag and off to
of women's shelter the maybe pile I'm
gonna try on and all of this well time
to list it so like I said I'm teaming up
with Poshmark for this then so I'm just
gonna post it all up on my Poshmark
super easy and just snap a few pics
describe it and bam it is up for sale
one pair down three hundred and thirteen
pairs to go woo so here are some of the
shoes that I'm selling I have literally
70 billion of them so all of these shoes
will be listed on my Poshmark probably
later today so there we go
ah now that everything is slightly more
organized and not a disgusting giant
pile we are good to go on dun dun dun no
clothes by the way yes I am just
casually up here risking my life for you
um literally like up in my chandelier
and balancing on a tiny little ledge but
but anyways anything for you guys so uh
now to the clothes I'm just gonna get
down first though huh okay here we go
alright so to be honest I don't even
really know where to start so I guess
I'm just gonna go through stuff and
we're just gonna do the same old thing
the piles
the give away the maybe and the sell so
I rummaged through my clothes all day
and as you can tell actually had quite a
good time doing this I found stuff I
wore last week stuff I don't think I've
ever worn before sparkly stuff casual
stuff cool stuff not so cool stuff
things I forgot about things I love two
things I hated and everything in between
it's always fun to have a fashion show
by yourself in front of a mirror never
fails to make you feel great so the last
time I cleaned out my closet was
actually this time last year so it's
been a second since I've done it so I
definitely have lots to go through but I
literally cleaned out my entire closet
with Poshmark last year and made like
800 bucks and went to London with the
money so it's totally free I linked it
below so you can download that so you
can get your hands on some of my goodies
so it's so weird
but anyways okay back to the vid
alrighty so here's my Poshmark closet
actually quite a few followers on here
because I've mentioned this in like a
zillion videos before because I really
actually love it but yeah you can see
this is where I listed all of my clothes
last year I've actually bought a lot of
things off Poshmark too so if you guys
have a cool closet of cool stuff to sell
please create a closet we post stuff
I'll buy your stuff you can buy my stuff
it'll be great I'll be like Sisterhood
of the Traveling Pants except well ya
know it would be we're just not going to
Greece maybe we could go to Greece I
don't know hello Greek travel agencies
sponsor me No so after going through all
my stuff literally all day I started at
like 9 a.m. and didn't finish till like
7:30 p.m. I started to get the hang of
it and eventually the piles grew and so
did the pile of my floor but you know
we'll ignore that and finally it was all
ready to go and look at this my closet
looks like a brand new woman and I'm
really gonna try to keep her this way
try being the operative word here but
try and we even got more room for a
couple new things so I'd say that's a
mission accomplished
oh how sad is that I'm honestly
exhausted from doing that but finally my
closet is clean and everything is a
visually listed for sales so huh time to
go shopping I'm kidding but I'm also not
really so anyways thank you guys so much
for watching the silly video I hope you
guys enjoyed cleaning Mike wasn't with
me because it would be really boring to
do alone so thanks for hanging out put
the bow back in my hair there real quick
so um as always if you have any
choose comments concerns all my socials
are at amber shell so you can hit me up
on there if you want to buy any of my
stuff my Poshmark is linked in the
description and I guess that's it I
don't know do I have anything else to
say
I guess not I love you guys happy closet
cleaning until next time bye angels EXO
oh my gosh I have the funniest stuff
this just really looks like a pop star
