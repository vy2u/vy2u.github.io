magnificent I know that's like such a
weird way to start out this video but
honestly I've been waiting to get those
pillows in for like weeks and weeks so
this is a very exciting moment for me I
just thought I'd document it anyway
what's up you guys
it's amber welcome back to my channel
and if you're new my voice doesn't
always sound like this I don't know why
I'm like suddenly getting sick or
something and also my nails look super
weird they're usually like really long
cause but they all broke so rocking the
short nail look today aside of the
pillows it's kind of been a rough Monday
I thought to brighten up the day I'd go
ahead and take you guys on a little
shopping adventure which you guys know I
love a good bargain so today I'm gonna
take you on one of my favorite bargain
hunting tips shopping for yourself in
the kids section I'm gonna go ahead and
show you how to get a bangin deal and
see what kind of goodies we can find all
while shopping in the section made for
the tiny tots even though we're kind of
a big tot but whatever so without
further ado here we go an old crusty
amber man voice narrated shopping in the
kids section oh yes I'm really short I'm
a kid that's why I'm in here okay no
anyway so as always before we get going
here's our outfit of the day which I did
kind of try to like be a little preteen
inspired by this just so you know we
don't get too angry with me for shopping
in there so we've got a little
kindergartener 90s ponytail here I've
got a super cute little Flair --red kind
of mini dress things so fun turn on a
denim jacket because it's actually
freaking freezing in LA right now um
which I'm gonna be really cold in this
but you know whatever in the words of
cardi B oh it never gets cold I've got
some sneakers with this look because
we're trying to be casual plus we're
going to be walking a lot so here we go
11-year old amber on would ha boo real
quick before we go since this video is
themed about kids and what is it
important for kids to do read so here's
a quick message from our sponsor audible

Rowling's fantastic beasts or if you're
really in the mood the unabridged

started especially since its 28c big
word or take the tips to better yourself
with more books my knowledge and now
back to our regularly scheduled okay
where to first
alrighty let's see what we can find my
gosh this is adorable this size won't
fit me but I bet this would hmm this is
so cute it's definitely supposed to be a
long-sleeved top but on me I think it'll
be a crop top
what else can we find literal children
okay
sorry pants only works sometimes if they
have a really big size but we'll see
did oh let's do it alrighty here we go
let's stop let's try it one you can see
even this is so cute it's literally just
like a little tweed jacket and since the
sleeves are too short I just rolled them
up to make them three-quarter length and
boom you would never know the difference
Elwood's reporting for law school yeah
biker chic Big Bird you see this is
actually super cute too again I should
probably get one more size up just so
the sleeves aren't too short but totally
fits fun color too and guess what 4590
the kids version the adult version is
6990 this skirt is actually a little big
which is weird but you can see the idea
is super cute this is a 14 I probably
could have gotten a 12 but you can see
on this top so cute
like I said I think it's supposed to be
a long sleeve and not a crop top but ooh
I love it
very nautical vibes okay so these jeans
are not the most flattering things I've
ever seen but how do they do fit mm-hmm
twelve again the length on kids jeans is
actually usually better than a regular
because I'm only 5 3 so that actually
works out pretty well yeah I read it
mission accomplished next stop
all righty time for one of my favorite
places in the whole world
Oh shoes Oh
oh my god unfortunately this is not
we're doing today but all right kids
shoes
where are they hiding all right so the
kids choose department is lit because
you can get literally the same exact
result shoes for cheaper just for
getting them in the kids version check
it out the adidas up here about 99 bucks
same exact shoe in the adult sighs look
at this
119 so we save 20 bucks all righty let's
see so I need some new kicks a serve
what kind of kick should we get these
you know I'm kidding okay seriously I
need some new gym shoes sir maybe some
of these oh my god these are so cute
baby goals mm-hmm what will fit me I'm
like a five and a half six and kids so
let's see mmm these are cool Hey a
perfect so see here we go we're trying
this on this is a us five kids which is
a 37 and a half which is actually a
women's Senate so let's try it on look
at that they think I can't do the
moonwalk look I'm trying
sold thing better better tap your heels
three times Doki
there's no place like home there's no
place like home Brock kids shoes are so
lit they're so sparkly guys we're doing
it yeah yeah yeah pretty cool pretty
good fella now on to the next first
shall we go the awful newbies came in
baby sizes goals goals all righty so I
actually heard gap has a great kids
section so let's check it out my entire
future is upstairs now I'm kidding okay
anyways up we go oh how long are these
stairs
anyways okay here we go kids okay so as
Jesus's I definitely don't think no
matter what size I get I would ever fit
in the baby clothes so maybe another day
we're gonna stick to the kids section
for now but uh let's see is there
anything fun work at ladies working bra
hmm I don't know there's a lot of like
logo to wear here that's not really the
vibe that I'm going for
oh it's actually really cute do they
have a big size
well whoa they do tie it up and there's
a cute little denim crop shirt when you
have to farm at 4:00 but have a date at
5:00 perfect take a look at that this is
practically the exact same shirt but
this one is 59.95 and the kids version
is only 34 so fun hack needless to say
we're going with this one this has
literally nothing to do with anything
but I just thought this was the cutest
little store display ever I love this
place okay anyways back to shopping so
we didn't forget sometimes
are these kids glasses
I don't even know but they are very tiny
on my big end anyways next location
alright in next stop target mostly
because in this red I look like the
target mascot so my voice okay anyways
uh let's see what are they goal tune
here herm not the most wonderful
selection I've ever seen hmm hmm like
this is super soft and cute but these
don't come in the big sizes is there
anything in here for me
this maybe oh god I hate to say targets
a bust because I love Target but this
was a bust
alrighty we are now at the mall my voice
is really really going away but we're
gonna see it forever 21 can pull through
for us with some more cool stuff
alrighty let's see what we got here
oh this little dresses could be cute so
cute
so is this alrighty we got quite a few
Goods so let's try one kind of cute not
super flattering but you know picnic
outfit on fleek so retro oh I didn't
even button this ok this actually looks
like me trying to wear kids clothes so
this is a no we're just gonna head home
in do uh-huh okay so I'm officially
super sick but here is our official home
here we go what did we get um I ended up
getting from Zara I got that little
white crappie top thing which like I
said it's not actually a crop top I got
a size five so for a literally a five
year old but you saw it was super cute
so there we go got dad's um vet oh oh
yes I got the groovy sneakers which are
so cute you can see it they have like
little flecks of pink in them so they're
plain white but they also got a little
bit up to them
what else did I get Oh randomly on the
way home I ended up getting some socks
which also if you buy in the kids
section are much cheaper so there we go
I got the same little headband which
obviously is in from the kids section
but you know what that's okay I wanted
it and this is my video I make the rules
so how about it and then I ended up
getting a different color of the denim
shirt but there we go with who a lot and
that is my little kids section shopping
haul so obviously I don't do this all
the time it's just sometimes when I'm
looking for basics like a t-shirt or a
jacket sneakers you can always find it
in the kids section for just a little
bit cheaper so I always check it out
before I make any big purchases so there
you go now you know I did the grand
total I saved about 60 bucks so pretty
cool pretty cool PS this also works for
furniture and stuff so if you shop like
on Pottery Barn Teen instead of Pottery
Barn you know red
it's a lot cheaper so there you have it
you guys is my little kid shucks it what
kids section shopping haul I hope you

old time filming it for you and for once
