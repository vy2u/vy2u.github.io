welcome back to my channel
I guess it's not actually much of a
surprise because you clicked on this
video so what else would you expect to
see but me but yeah okay anyways so
today we are going to go on another
little shopping adventure and I thought
I would put a twist again on my regular
shopping routine by doing something that
I have wanted to try for a long time
which is just going shopping in the
men's section men's where it's super fun
everyone loves the boyfriend jackets and
all that cute stuff so I thought we
would skip the boyfriend and go straight
to the boyfriend clothes oh yeah without
further ado here we go shopping in the
men's section maybe we'll meet a cute
man hmmm I'm kidding we're shopping for
clothes not boyfriends but you know
anyways here we go and of course as
always before we get going here is my
outfit of the day a super weird today at
an arm's just like really in a
denim-on-denim mood so I got a denim top
so you matching denim booty shorts might
stain your purse and to top it all off
woo my leg leg sitting shoes that I wear
all the time so here we go
I'd say we're ready let's confine just a
man men wear remember we're shopping for
clothes okay oh side note is it not the
most beautiful day out
look at that alright onward ho here we
go
sorry we're shaking it up today we're at
3rd Street Promenade so people kind of
fun stuff we can get into over here
surprise again I don't know why I keep
saying surprise nothing is a surprise
but I got this coming with me today so
um two women shopping for men's clothes
in the red section shall we go alright a
so we're going to start hmm because the
M stands for men now I'm totally kidding
but here we go up we go no faster faster
run up the stairs hey what are we gonna
get am i doing it right now
no this is what I meant - put it down
focus ok so I was kind of thinking
things like oversized sweatshirts
oversized t-shirts just like a bunch of
oversized stuff so I'm not really sure
could you hop
aha like this is super cute stuff like
this and for some reason men's clothes
are so much cheaper than women's clothes
like look at the $14.99 conspiracy area
so I'm not really yeah
okay anyways so we tried these I should
really like these winners I'm gonna
which girls like better thank you well
you do you should try this on just try
this on wanted yeah okay try it on I
again I don't need to get on the cut and
experience so we're just going to see
what kind of women what we're good
memory
yeah yeah I'm making a document you want
to be in it you know I told you we'd
meet men in the men's section so many oh
oh I literally do not know why this is
just what are you doing something
special
look at this I don't know why this is
just hanging out and it's $15 but I am
literally sold
[Laughter]

Desai's oh uh this is not over something
like I thought it was going to be this

need like an extra-large and this is a
small everybody walk by her bottle well
who isn't where what I had in mind
personally with the like oversized you
know kind of longer lepay me cool thing

online that they have cool men's stuff
so we're going to check it out oh this
did I get this all denim have to match
my all denim outfit now makes my head
look like an egg alright anyway blue
took this fun I feel so silly shopping
in the men's section in heels but okay
you do what you got to do let's see what
we got
why does this kind of look like
something Kylie Jenner would wear
killing it sir killing it honestly I
feel like these would be pretty cute but
I don't know maybe not don't quite my
style in here so time to bounce I think
this I literally do not know what this
is doing here but oh my god oh marble
luggage this is not at all what I was
supposed to be there for but like I
might just apply that why is that here
nothing to do with anything
I love you I always know I was girly but
I never really realized how girly I was
until I tried to not shop for girls
stuff all day very difficult very
difficult would it even be my video
we didn't come in here for over 21 My
Kingdom honestly it's gonna be really
hard you like to not shop for girls
stuff but also kids also gifts and we'll
find the men's things oh no no no we are
going to men such as men men men
okay well-dressed men here we go woo
actually really love this denim jacket
very kind of Pablo inspired for us
honestly though so Pablo Torres not
Malay I kind of love it
so cute
obviously even by itself this jean
jacket is super cute these men are
dressed so well shoe game not that great
I can success well for once I didn't buy
anything in Burma 21 that day oh my god
honestly men's clothes are so hot Wow
amazing oh yeah enough to department
stores let's see what we've got in here
oh my god you guys look at the floors in
here gold shopping bags marble floors
and fake diamonds my aesthetic men's
stores are so beautifully organized Wow
maybe it's because I'm not here to
ruffle everything up a cake pop shirt I
wish there would feel a vision because
everything is so off what's the heck
where do they get this stuff from and
why isn't it on girls clothes oh my god
these men are serving looks this totally
looks like something my husband Harry
would wear well nothing really thrilled
me in there so on to the next
who maybe will pop in one designer store
oh my God look at the men's shoes
Loki I must have them honestly I'm
living look at this bathrobe men have it
made you guys men haven't made on this
tree this is so cute this would be
adorable
as like a little dress one's a little
big but and above all is not side yes
well this doesn't really fit that good
so I guess no such luck oh holy this is
the kind of men where I'm talking about
look at this you guys oh my god
sparkly bow Thailand Oh peacock feather
bowties literally if this isn't my
future boyfriend I don't even know
look at these sneakers oh my god men's
shoes I'm so sad they don't come in my
size Wow allows designer men's fashion I
would to billion percent wear this
again if this wasn't so big like with a
little crop top underneath or something
oh my gosh so sexy very Harry Styles s -
I am literally living for this
over-the-top mess we're stuck who fired
alright we're going to investigate
Bloomingdale's next oh hey hey hey oh my
bad doing a collection whisper slop hmm
this is kind of fun it's not really
trying to drop stacks for a sweatshirt
but still close aim the job one step
closer to Harry I actually already own
this but I thought for the purposes of
this video I would try it on again
because I saw it go super cute men large
t-shirts
great dress hello boy
surprise I just know I'm getting but uh
I guess this is surprised for literally
the third time and all the only time
that even makes any sense because I
really need to work on how I like format
these chasing blogs because one second
I'm shopping in the next second I'm just
like randomly sitting on my floor my
house but uh anyways you guys don't care
right okay anyways here is my haul
alrighty so I actually bought quite a
few things today we will start with when
did I get it packs on oh I'm wearing
what I bought a packs on this groovy
adidas oversized t-shirt so cute I loved
it so that's Tess H&amp;amp;M I got what is this
oh this is that oversized Calvin Klein
shirt that I literally already had but
since it is men's wearing was cute I
decided to just start in the bag and
include it in my haul anyways okay back
to the things that I actually can pull
out of this bag oh yeah the velour
sweater I got the super groovy velour
sweat shirt from H&amp;amp;M and it was
literally 15 dollars so love this what
else I got that other giant oversized
gray sweatshirt not the tight one the
one that look kind of looks like a
t-shirt super cute love this - and
anything else oh and this is not
menswear but I thought these glittery
socks were just too cool not to get so
that's some glittery socks even though
they were kind of a ripoff at $13 but
cool
what else did I get actually this is
really funny this hall is actually not
much men was where I got some little
crappie lace tops from forever21 that
we're super cute so I know that's not
menswear either but I did get quite a
few stuff I got you know the two
sweaters and the shirt and the other
shirt so actually was a pretty cool
success honestly you guys I would say
verdict is menswear is like super lips
sorry I'm just like trying to take my
hair down at the same time as doing this
video because entertaining me anyways um
verdict is like I said men where is lit
I found so much cool stuff all you guys
with boyfriends are so lucky you can
always just steal your man's clothes but
uh I don't know I guess for those single
ladies like me what's the harm in buying
it yourself oh by the way forget gender
stereotypes if you want to wear girls go
wear girl clothes don't wear boy clothes
wear boy clothes who cares where would
you like wear was make you feel fabulous
as always if you have any questions
