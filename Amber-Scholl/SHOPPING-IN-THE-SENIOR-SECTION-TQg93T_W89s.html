remember that meme that is like such a
random throwback but you guys it's amber
welcome back to my channel and welcome
to my car why are we sitting at your car
ever well because there was no good
lighting in my apartment so I thought
you just come sit in here whether it's
fabulous lighting correlating is
excellent for selfies in making your
highlight look poppin anyways how did
nothing to do with this video so to what
we're supposed to be doing I love making
shopping videos and a bunch of you guys
have commented on my last video that I
should try shopping in the old person
section sounds so disrespectful and rude
I don't know if there's a nice way to
say that but uh I didn't say it you said
it
so um apparently it exists so we're
gonna go on a little adventure today and
see what kind of goodies we can find in
the section reserved for the grandmas so
without further ado here we go shopping
in the grandma section
I just realized I forgot to do my outfit
of the day so we're gonna go back inside
really quick and do that Boop so what
the heck are we wearing today I have
literally no idea I just couldn't be
bothered to really get dressed today so
we're wearing a very strange assortment
of whatever this is oh we got some like
pajama jumpsuit look in the thing didn't
get my hair to do anything so we put it
in high pony with one of these little
what is this we got some sparkly jewelry
ooh Lala some clicks oh I love them yes
yes some glittery Sunny's kind of like a
princess jasmine kind of vibe and there
we go let's get shopping
OOP second time out the hell oh and it's
locked
oh my god I really am losing it today
you guys alrighty so we're gonna check
out Kohl's because I googled it and said
maybe they have a section for that so
let's see
hey so I asked and they said they didn't
have a specific section but they said
this was the closest we got so we'll see
what we can find my god these pants with
the stretchy things this / oh this is
what I'm talking about perfect
oh my gosh this is literally too good oh
you see here oh my god 2007 me is like
screaming hmm does this count not really
but we're gonna try it anyway already
let's try it on oh yes work it mama
vogue okay so this doesn't fit that good
but maybe something else will I'm dead
grandma but make it sexy oh my god you
know I actually really like this thank
you for coming to my performance yes
I'll be back next week actually you know
what's funny about these I feel like if
you were these in a certain way they
could actually be very trendy Mossi
courtesy yes have manners mmm oh oh my
gosh should we do it of course we do
it's me after all oh my god this is the
biggest mood I've ever seen thank you so
much cool all right next up
million-dollar tales with my pick some
fun okay so according to many sources
JCPenney is the place to go so
Oh God where do we even start in here
hmm
alright here we go let's see what we can
gather oh my god this is amazing just
shop in for some stuff the biggest
problem is they don't have my size in
anything they can't fit many of it you
know what if you had this tailored to
fit ah it could actually be really cute
my grandma's favorite color was purple
well again paired with something cool
this could be fire when you're shopping
like this fashion is all about using
your imagination oh my god I love it oh
my good I can't wait to be old Red Hat
Society here I come oh my gosh this
person's literally exactly what my gram
used to carry oh my heart whoo
alrighty yes okay so now we're gonna go
and try and see if there's Emma shoes
beep world well that sounds perfect ok
mood but ok we need to focus I thought
we were looking for here ok I actually
don't even want to try these people
might be fun ok maybe one pair oh my
goodness look at the little baby feet
these are low key the most comfortable
shoes I've ever worn ever do I buy these
no ok what about old men's shoes Wow
amazing
all right Edmund I mean she's not so
subtle me the odds of that uh I just
don't see myself waking any of those so
we'll head out go ahead and wrap up the
trip home how beautiful is Melly
all right so it is actually the next day
I was way too tired when I came home
yesterday to filmy outro so or not the
outro what am I talking about the hall
oh my god you guys like I said I've been
like losing my mind lately I don't know
what's going on my brain is just going
it like a little I mean like it's always
going ten million miles a minute but
lately it's been like extra below it
doesn't so ok get right to the hall
shall we great ok oh ok I will show you
guys what we bought and then I will show
you how I'm going to style them so I did
end up buying this blue jacket thing I
actually am so excited for this you're
gonna see it's gonna be fab um what else
did we get oh yes
cold ok so this actually wasn't part of
the senior section at all but it was on
SuperDuper clearance so I got it for 7
bucks so that was pretty cool I can't
resist a good deal so uh what else did
we get ah yes I got the big long blue
cardigan thing this is going to be so
fun especially you can see it's hard to
tell but can you see it kind of got some
sparkly samaritans I actually randomly
bought this - I actually don't really
know why but if we I just have a problem
when I go shopping I just like need to
buy stuff so got this - have no idea
what I'm gonna do with it but we'll find
something
so I'm gonna go ahead and model these
for you right now well not this one but
these show you how to style them so you
look grew fantastic okay so the best tip
to styling anything with stuff in your
own closet is to look for things that
are basic that will pop with any old
something sentence didn't make a ton of
sense but what we're gonna do is go with
a basic black dress because anything
basic matches something fabulous get
some killer shoes to match some Sunny's
too and these will make the jacket from
kind of boring to fabulous so time for
the show oh my god did you hear my
joints just crack maybe I am getting old
to sell perfect day for this video okay
let's try it on we've got some very
retro Lord vibes getting on here the
blaze I paired with the little black
dress and of course the choker some
killer funny and a little selfie scarf
thing
of course the heels don't hurt either it
weird off the shoulder for an even
chiller vibe end well I'm stealing
grandma's clothes never looked better
you know this actually looks pretty nice
but this outfit but we're gonna go ahead
and switch it up instead so whoo let's
see what we got from her murmur murmur
what do we do here today well this way
how ridiculous is it that I just had
these boots that match it freakin
perfectly what so anyways those come in
handy for this voila
here we go so if you want since the
knees that I got for three dollars down
down a nice little antique looking
necklace because that kind of goes with
the slightly oversized classy vibe here
stuff it's so big you should always put
something tight underneath so it shows
your fornum even when you eat a little
too much before filming this so you have
some like fat rolls but you know it's
fine and everyone has them so there we
go
hmm granny slay keishon I literally
don't even know what I meant by that
sentence but there we go that is how
we're going to rock this senior look
ready to steal all the retirement
community daddies I'm gonna cut that out
so there you guys that was me shopping
in the senior section I hope you enjoyed
the video but before I finish my outro
please stay tuned for my click TED talk
fashion is all about what makes you feel
the best in your own skin there is no
age limit on clothing you can wear
whatever you want to any age
old in between who cares catch me in the
nursing home in a miniskirt and high
heels there's nothing that you can't
wear if you want to rock it so don't
forget that one more thing clothes
definitely don't mean you're asking for
it sorry to get political but it's
important oh that final note thank you
