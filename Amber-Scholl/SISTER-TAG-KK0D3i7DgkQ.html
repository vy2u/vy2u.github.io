third amigo in the house no not house we

watched one sister tag in my life so I
didn't really plan for this so I'm going

sister tag question so here we go um
sister tag questions okay so we're going
to start with some simple question what
is my worst quality nah but oh yeah look

you okay I let me we're going to start
from the beginning how do I know this
girl she's my sister what was my first
experience with her her asking me mom
disregard me to death and take me back
to the hospital we hang up but most
older siblings do that
my mom said according to psychologists a
lot of older siblings do not like their
younger sisters when four siblings in
general when they're first brought home
because you're used to being the star of
the family hasn't changed I'm cuter it
has it's just me in the video so we're
gonna focus we're going to try and
really do some real questions so here we
go what is something that we have in
common DNA that's bone she's not wrong

describe the other extra what would I
say about you funny oh she's really
funny thank you you're welcome well hmm
