skit I know I know it was really weird
so anyways let's just get to the intro
shall we you guys amber welcome back to
my channel so the other day on my
Instagram I posted this fabulous selfie
and because I'm just so hilarious I
captioned it still his hoodie and don't
text him back looks and so many of you
guys dance me that that should be a
whole lookbook so I figured okay
why not so even though we don't have a
real boyfriend hair you'll just have to
do for now I'm always talking in the
men's section and have lots of ideas on
how to make men's clothes look fabulous
on yourself so without further ado here
we go stealing your boyfriend's clothes
look that started it all we're stealing
our boyfriend's oversized hoodie I got
it at H&amp;amp;M for like $20 you can see it's
just like a little zip up thing plus we
got the nice white bodies it's so
stinkin cute I love jeans with Rick's in
them because it makes things extra
casual oh my god I love them we're going
a little bit of luxury here with the
feet we got some nice kicks and a fancy
new purse but any white sneakers and any
cute purse will have the same effect
doesn't have to be designer to be
fabulous definitely a kind of going to
pick up the kids from school kind of
vibe but if you have no kids I don't
know ready to pick up my imaginary kids
in style hmm everyone knows boys look
hot as heck and gray sweatpants but uh
you know who looks better in them you
the most comfortable and where in the
world belongs to men so why not go ahead
and steal it so this is kind of a
continuation of our netflix and chill'
lookbook for you know lounging around
the house running to the grocery store
doing whatever you wanna do you know
it's your life these are men's gray
sweatpants I went ahead and gotten an
extra small so they would fit me but you
know any size will do they'll just be a
little more oversized just so we got
those my newest additions to the family
puffy slippers a nice white cropped top
matches the look perfectly and voila
count it ready to go to bed Netflix and
chill shoot some hoops with the boys I
don't know what to mend even do these
days for fun on the side of go steal em
hmm hmm Justin who my favorite kind of
boy a bad boy swoon so for this look we
are channeling our inner biker chic bed
ass lady can I say ass I don't know but
I just said it so if you can't say it
don't tell anyone but I just did but
we've got a fabulous little black get up
here so the centerpiece of this look is
our boyfriend's black leather jacket I
picked this one up for 40 bucks at H&amp;amp;M
so cute underneath that we've got a lacy
black dress to add a little bit of
femininity to the look contrast is fine
the opposites attract so fabulous
booty's to pair with the look black
sunglasses so we can hide our identity
while we're robbing a bank in this
outfit later and voila that's this is
alrighty for this next look we're
stealing our boyfriend's shoes
just kidding if those your boyfriend's
shoes as well your boyfriend has great
taste in shoes but anyways okay so here
we go we are actually just sealing a
sweater for this look so this is a men's
oversized sweater but it's actually not
meant to be oversized
it's meant to be tight on the hubby but
on me it's a very saucy and oversized
sweater chest so you can see it
literally just like a rib - sweater so
fun and I got an extra large so it would
be long and fab I just love the
aesthetic of oversized stuff with tight
boots so maybe got some killer boots
made for walking to match with it ooh
yes some gold to match because you know
what they say the bigger the hoop the
bigger the and wallah
that's this look I don't know what I'm
doing with my hands but mm-hmm
next one oh you can already tell this
one's gonna be good denim denim and
Lourdes Anna yes
everyone always asks me where I get my
oversized denim jackets and the answer
if the men's section always if you want
your denim to have more of that boxy
oversized feel the men's section is
always the way to go I went ahead and
paired it with a lacy bodysuit to make
it extra girly and nothing goes better
with denim to denim so we've got a denim
miniskirt if the top is lacy we've got
the bottom lacy - oh such killer pups
and voila you look better and your
boyfriend's clothes the Vita's girls
rule boys drool okay boo-boo what kitten
mama this kind of look is all the rage
on the runways right now oh my goodness
so high fashion and fat so for this look
we've just stolen our man's black work
Blazers brought it on top of whoo look
at that this is the best little feathery
skirt in the world I am obsessed with it
on top is a lace bodysuit that is
totally see-through and oops paint it
with some thinly stripes black shoes to
keep this simplicity we've seen all
sorts of celebrities wearing
of the similar sort we've got Kim we've
got GG Rihanna all the Kardashians out
here wearing this kind of look you can
open the buttons to for a totally
different look oh look at that
fierce mama ready to work the Paris
runway scene in style or take on a
corporate business meeting though you'd
have to be in a very interesting line of
work to read this
ooh we even switched up our lipstick to
match this one this one is gonna be good
I call this look the sexy lumberjack
that's exactly what it is look we've got
a lumberjack jacket courtesy of our man
your everyday men's hoodies soft cozy
and very limber Jackie a plain strappy
white dress to go underneath it Oxford
pumps with socks are adorable and very
nineties but I just freaking love them
so that's what we're gonna wear with
this one
definitely looks like we're gonna go
chop down some trees but who knows maybe
we're just gonna go shopping on his
credit card of course all right here we
go this is the last look kidding but we
are gonna go ahead and use this as the
base so men organized white t-shirts are
a blank canvas for anything you want
them to be so we're gonna do two looks
with this one step one manager step two
and accessorize a plain white tee no pun
intended on the band there if anyone
remembers them at all did I just age
myself three hundred years probably but
I do see a plain white tee can be easily
transformed into any kind of look you
want with accessories so I went ahead
and put a black little corset belt
around the top so it looks more like a
dress black boots strike yet again for
some fabulous fabulous ot again with the
black Sonny's because you know why not
and there we go
option number one quick fix to your
man's white tee in a snap all right
option two go ahead and give it a quick
little tie up in the back you know like
you can kind of see sort of I just threw
a little hair tie around it and tuck it
underneath so you can't see and then you
got a nice little crop top men's
t-shirts are just great for working out
in because they're so airy I'm like you
know you just feel so free since the
other one dressed it up we're kind of
dressing it down for the gym here so
I went ahead and thrown some yoga pants
that I actually ordered off of tumblr
which is so funny
some black running trainers Oh ready to
go a fake designer hat I got on eBay
because you know don't tell anyone
you're ready to go to the gym in style
hmm one squat to squat three squat done
okay all righty this next look I'm
actually not gonna lie I debated whether
this actually counted as boyfriend
clothes for a long time because you know
these are technically just boyfriend
style jeans not actually men's clothes
but I decided boyfriend jeans is close
enough and it's my video I make the
rules so here we go next look so for
this we've got some boyfriend style
Levi's very very distressed you can see
in fact they're so distressed
I actually distressed them a little too
much on top we've got a nice tight nude
body said to contrast the baggy jeans
and for shoes we've got these fluffy
monsters oh so nice vanina's buddy nice
and that's really it for this one
keepin it quick simple and fabulous
alright next look 10 is enough I'm
running out of outfits so there have you
guys not with my take on stealing your
boyfriend's clothes and wearing them out
in the real life world hope you guys
