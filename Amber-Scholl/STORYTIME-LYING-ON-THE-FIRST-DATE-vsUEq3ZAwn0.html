back to my channel um so today I'm going
to be doing my very first story time
video um because I had a very funny
weekend and I want to tell you about it
so it starts out with me going to the
grocery store okay so it all starts out
when I'm walking around the grocery
store just completely minding my own
business picking up some avocados when
all of a sudden poof but a boo but right
away the hottest man in the world walks
by me and I was like oh my god
obviously I didn't scream like that in
real life I did it mentally because I'm
a respectable lady so I'm not sure if he
likes saw me freaking out over him or
what but eventually he comes over to me
while I'm standing picking out avocados
and he was like hey what's up
I just noticed you're really beautiful
I'd love to take you out to dinner
tonight and so I'm like so I give him my
number and he says great I'll pick you
up at 7:30 see you then and I was like
ok see you then see you then
so I go home really quick in my shower
and I'm getting ready and he says ok
I'll see you at 7:30 I'll pick you up
what's your address and I was like whoo
I think I've been watching too many
American Horror Story like crying murder
things because I was like well I don't
want this man to know where I live yet
so I have the best idea ever to give him
a fake address all right now mind you
probably the nicest apartment complex in
Beverly Hills is about three blocks away
from me not even I can walk there in
under five minutes so I have this bright
idea I have the address memorized so
etext means is what's your address and
the first thing I think of is to type in
that text in the address but um and I
said great okay this will be this is the
best idea ever I'll just be picked up
from there and that way he won't know
where I live thinking in my mind if he
doesn't seem crazy when the date is over
hmm we can come back to my actual house
and he can drop me off where I really
live and I'll explain the whole thing
and he'll totally understand that's not
what happened so I'm finally ready and
I'm in a rush now because I remembered I
have to walk to this other place that
I'm saying that I live at so I get ready
and I'm in heels I'm like
across the busiest streets in LA I'm
like sprinting across La Cienega cuz I'm
late and I'm like okay I almost getting
killed a hundred times but anywho I get
there in time and I'm just sitting in
the lobby I walk in and I'm like hmm
okay and I don't even know like there is
no reason that I should have picked this
one I should have picked literally any
apartment building but this one because
this one is so so nice like there's
literally a ballet in front and there's
Butler's and like I don't know how much
it costs to live here maybe 10 grand a
month I really don't know but um
completely out of my league entirely
like not even sort of a little bit
believable oh well now I have to go with
it so I'm sitting in the lobby waiting
to be picked up from this building I
literally don't live in um I get a ring
ring he's like hey what's up and like
I'm here I'm out friend come on out and
I was like okay yeah so I walk outside
and he's an was like really nice
tricked-out black BMW so I was like it's
lit so he rolls up and I'm just like I
just got to get my car fast so we can go
to wherever we're going and I don't have
to think about this anymore because I'm
already realizing that this is a bad
idea
so I give him the car and he was like
wow you live in a really nice building
and I was like so now I'm like yeah it's
nice I never said I lived there I just
agreed with him that it was a nice
building so we end up going to Rodeo
Drive it's like this really nice fancy
restaurant you paid for everything I was
like holla this is great so he totally
proves himself at dinner he's so nice
and so fun to talk to and all we just
end up having like a really good time
totally great date
cool I can tell them where I live now
when he drops me off at home it won't be
weird so we leave um and we're walking
back to my car and he like kisses me in
the parking garage which isn't super
romantic literally at all but whatever I
think he's like you know what I'm not
really done with the date yet let's go
somewhere else and I was like okay sure
so we end up going to the Beverly Hills
Hotel and eating dinner not dinner but
like we eat desserts and have drinks um
at the Beverly Hills Hotel and like the
Polo Lounge which is like this really
fancy nice place very fun
um and then we end up going after that
he was like let's keep going mind you
it's like midnight at this point so I'm
like I'm so tired sir so we get the car
to go home and I'm just like so
distracted his hands on my thigh and
he's like kissing me while he's kind of
while he's driving but not really just
to like stop lights whatever I was like
damn this is like my head is all over
the place I'm just not thinking at all
so then all of a sudden I'm like whipped
out of my little fantasy land and he's
like what all right we're here and I was
like oh no I forgot to tell him that
this is not my actual house I thought it
was telling him right there but then I
just wasn't in really the proper mental
state so I was like oh uh um thank you
and got out thinking whatever I'll just
go inside and hang out in the lobby
again and it'll be whatever no it's like
now it's like 1:30 in the morning it's
really late so there is no one to open
the door for me I don't have a key to
this place because I don't live there
it's pitch black the valets are calling
about their sort gun there's not even
people that I could like hopefully wait
for to walk by to get in there's just
nobody because it's the middle of the
night this is about to be very awkward
so I walk up to the door and I like
pretend to press the keypad I don't know
what to Pratt just liked it and added a
pretending I have a key um and
unfortunately he's a nice person so he's
not just driving away like I was hoping
it's like maybe he'll just leave without
watching me go inside no no such luck he
waits and like a nice man waiting he was
like looking outside of the window
tinted black windows was like for you
are you good and I was like oh no what
do I say I just pull out my phone I like
pretend that it's ringing I was like
Hello I guess I don't know I'm
pretending I'm faking a conversation
completely like I don't even know what
I'm talking about him so after my fake
30-second conversation on my iPhone I
rap on his windows like hi so could you
actually take me to my friend's house
mind you two seconds ago in the car ride
home I was just saying how tired I was
like I'm exhausted like I can't wait to
go to sleep now three seconds later I
apparently have just changed my mind and
now I want to go to a party what so no I
have to pretend that I'm going to my
friend's house when
actually my own house but I didn't want
him to think that Mike I was lying
even though I was totally lying um so I
plug in my address my own address to
maps and I was like yeah okay navigating
how to get there even though I know
exactly how to get there because it's
right across the street and I live there
now I'm stuck in this lie so I'm
pretending I don't know where it is I
was like oh yeah um yeah make a left
here I think I think it's this house I'm
not sure a mess so after about three
minutes of me
get pretending to not know where I was
going so we actually did end up making
like eight wrong turns and it took like
20 minutes
um but regardless we finally get to my
house and the first thing he says when
he pulls up he looks out the window goes
this looks weird
and I died I was like hey buddy this is
my real house but of course I can't say
that so I was just like yep it is kind
of weird
so anyways I get out of the car and I
walked right up and then I realized I
can't just walk in with my key because
then that'll look weird why do I have a
key to my friend's apartment so I was
like oh so again I make a fake phone
call and then I was like it's I'm tired
I don't care if he sees me so I just end
up using my key and walking inside does
he see probably doesn't think it's weird
probably irrelevant because flash
forward to the next day he texted me
again so it's about eight o'clock at
night he texts me is like hey what are
you doing you want to go to dinner again
I was like this is kind of last-minute
notice but short so he was great I'll
pick you up in ten I was like oh my god
I'm just sitting on my couch like a
loser because that's what I do 99% of
the time so I'm like like scrambling to
get ready I'm like throwing mascara on
and like brushing my hair really quick
and like hmm whatever throwing on red
lipstick few minutes go by and he texts
me goes hey I'm out front and I was like
okay oh I forgot I still didn't clear up
where I live
oh I text and was like oh hey actually
oh can you pick me up from my friend's
house again luckily like I said it's
like two minutes away not even so he
comes to pick me up he's like okay I'm
at your friend's house it's like alright
great so walk downstairs and I'm like
alright I'm gonna tell him right now
that this is where I live it'll be funny
we'll both get a kick out of it he'll
laugh I'll laugh it'll all be done we
can move on with our lives
no that's not-- happens he rolls down
his window before I even get in the car
it is like hey
you know that typical boy thing with a
fluffy hair and the smile and I was like
swoon and then my brain went elsewhere
and he was like so what were you doing
last night when I dropped you off here
you guys just party all night and have a
good time for some reason I was like
haha yeah that was like why did I say
yeah why why did you say that you got it
traffic my feelings exactly
he's like well that's fun you stay here
a lot that I was like um now I'm stuck
in the slide I already just slide so I
can't explain it now and I was just like
yes we stay here a lot because I live
here oh my god I'm not gonna tell him
the truth today um but whatever it's
fine oh so we go to dinner and we have a
great time again and we hang outs like a
little cafe we stay there for like four
hours
and again it's late so after dinner he's
like making out me in the car my brain
is like lemon Allah again so he's like
well do you want to like go back to your
place we can watch a movie and I'm
thinking this vault takes a lot of balls
to invite yourself over to my place but
second of all sure so he pulls around
he's driving but I was like wah wah and
before I know it I again forget to
mention it and we are in front of my
fake house again so now I'm thinking I
just agreed to let you come up to my
fake house that I don't live in how do I
explain that I don't live here now so I
was like um actually I changed my mind
um you can't come up and he was like why
I was like oh my god what do I say like
I just said you could how do I explain
myself so I was like um I just so I look
I turn my head to look out the window to
like think up something so I was like um
I just but he doesn't see that all he
sees is I just me being very what seems
to be dramatic so then he's like oh my
god like something happened I was like
oh my god now he thinks I've been hurt
like I'm lying to him about so many
things like this is unbelievable
so now I'm really stuck in this lie I
was like ah no I just want to talk about
it which is true I just didn't want to
talk about this because now I'm like
digging myself into ten deeper deeper
holes and he was
I'm so sorry like don't worry we don't
have to go um we can just do something
else I was like okay
so now I'd really don't know what to do
and it's like um well are your roommates
home and I was like uh I don't know so I
faked text my roommates her birth or
really just typing notes in my phone
like squiggle Bob dude below I don't
know
and um then I was like yeah one of
them's home and one of them is at my
friend's house can we go to my friend's
house and he was like you want to go
back to your house again I was like um
yes I left my shoes there which doesn't
make any sense why do i why should there
why don't to go there at 2:00 in the
morning they might ship but lo and
behold he agrees to take me to my
friend's house again so we pull up at my
friend's house which is really my house
again it's like 1:00 a.m. on a Sunday
night so there's no reason that I
shouldn't be going there or anyone
should be awake so he pulls up in front
and we're just sitting out there and he
was like so and I was like so this is so
awkward cuz like I was like maybe isn't
gonna kiss me goodbye I don't know so he
does and then he's like making out me in
the front seat which is super awkward by
the way you're like sitting one here and
one here it's like we're very weird
don't recommend it but um anyway so in
the middle of it there's like street
lights so I kind of just might being
late at night like very public so I
opened my eye like to make sure there's
no one there and out of the corner of my
eye I see someone walking towards me so
I was like and this man is like hi I was
like oh my god it's my landlord Misha
like oh my god how am I gonna get out of
this one and now his poor guy is so
confused he's like who's this girl now
at 1:00 in the morning walking on this
apartment building so he's like um who
is that I was like ah I already told him
I can't live here so how do I explain
this in my landlord as like um this is
my friend and he was sick that's your
friend
because granted Misha kinda looks like a
landlord like he's not my age like his
long brown hair just like it completely
doesn't make any sense but he would be
my quote friend um and not someone else
and so he was like um okay he was does
he live here and for some ungodly reason
I was like
oh why are you lying so much so he was
like he doesn't live here
misha is clearly loading groceries mind
you into his apartment like clearly and
picking up bags of groceries and walking
in and out of his house he was likes why
is he unloading um groceries then and I
was like um that's uh that's our friend
Matt's house who is Matt I don't know I
just made him up was like yeah Matt
lives in that apartment and he's our
friend and we're friends with everyone
in this building and all of the
surrounding buildings we all stay here
all the time we always swap houses nice
we're never staying in our own place
even though I live in a mega mansion
down the street
I'm staying here at this dinky apartment
complex it just didn't make any sense no
it's just been too long I'm sitting in
my pool of lies I'm just like dying then
I can't get out I've dug myself such a
steep pull I can't just be like telling
them the truth now like actually I do
live here after the 10,000 useless lies
that I've told about living here I don't
know if he thinks I'm homeless
I don't like he knows where I live I
think he might think that I'm just lying
to him completely maybe he thinks I'm
like Nisha is my sugar daddy or
something and that's why I'm here we'll
never know the truth but um he does know
I have a social media channel so Cameron

story I'm sorry maybe this is why I
don't have my voice oh my mom's gonna
