back to my channel um so first of all
before I even start this video can we
just look at how stinking cute my hair
is today it's like some serious ariana
grande vibes going on like I feel like I
should just be singing her song you know
like I'm 17 okay so that's not cool
anyways thanks guys have been asking for
another story time video I didn't want
to tell one until I had a real story to
tell but let me tell you after this past
weekend I have another story for you
guys so so it all starts this weekend
when I go to my weekly yoga class on
Sunday and this is normal yoga this is
hot yoga if you don't know what that is
it's basically the world's most
disgusting activity you're in a room of
like thirty strangers wearing basically
nothing and you're doing yoga poses like
oh yes namaste but it's disgusting in
there like it's intentionally set to 105
degrees so you're sweating puddles
you're gross it's gross so when you
leave this class you are completely
inappropriate to be in public like you
can't you're literally drenched in sweat
your hair is like Oh gross and in a
little ball the top of your head you
don't wear a lick of makeup because it
all just sweats off like you can
practically see your face on the towel
if you pat it dry and you wear makeup
it's like oh there is my eyebrows on
this beautiful white towel that they
gave me so I got to go straight home to
take a shower to eliminate myself of the
nasty mess that I've created so I'm
leaving the class and I'm like done
tonight tada I feel great all cleansed
and nice I'm gonna go take a shower and
have a great rest of my day so I'm
leaving until Bing OH
what is this my text message plot twist
hey are you available to work this party
at 12:00 today one of the girls
cancelled and we really need you to
cover for her okay so backstory on this
I've kind of a really random side job
being that I do a lot of social media I
will get paid to host parties which is
basically you get invited to event and
you're like the party host you take
pictures and like Instagram them and
whatever and promote whatever is going
on it's really weird but it's a great
way to make a few extra hundred bucks on
the weekends by getting paid to party I
know sweet gig
shout out to
and we're helping me out so I'm like uh
Haleh I could totally use this extra
hundred bucks this new pair of shoes
that I want at Nordstrom okay
so totally go ahead and buff me yes I'll
be there I respond and they're like
alright cool will text you to address
and information and a little it's a
twelve see you then I was like fantastic
being that it's like 11:30 in the
morning I was like great I don't have to
be there till midnight I got all the
time in the world so I'm driving home
literally sitting on a towel because I'm
still sweating falls I'm like feels like
the yoga class just really messes with
your internal temperature system for
like hours afterwards but anyways so I'm
driving I'm like la la thing another
text from the same people who booked me
they're like hey okay here's the address
see you in 15 and I was like in 15 what
are they talking about I got oh it don't
mean 12:00 midnight they meant 12:00
noon as in right now let me literally
feel like the mr. krabs meme it's like
the whole world is spinning and I was
like oh my god I can't go to this party
like uh-uh key I gotta cancel so I text
in background like hey ha I didn't
realize that you meant 12:00 noon I
thought you meant 12:00 midnight like
you know I usually work so I actually
can't come they didn't care um well
amber you're already booked for this we
are having you cover someone else so you
better be there or I mean I don't know
what they would have done but they were
like you better be there and I was like
huh so now I have got to myself into a
quite a little pickle well I cannot be
at an event in 10 minutes when I look
not even low-key like a wet rag I hike
you look like a wet rat and I tried to
explain to the mousse like you don't
understand I'm literally gross like I
just came from how yoga posture like we
both feel calm while I blocks like my
own okey dokey what am I going to do I
have to be at the party in like 15
minutes and I am completely gross and I
did I have to go straight there I can't
go home
or I'm going to miss the party so I go
straight there thankfully I'm kind of a
blob and there's a lot of things in my
truck so
I feel like I can get ready I'm going to
make this work somehow
I got this so I'm going through my trunk
like oh my god what can I wear like um
but so I finally find something I was
like okay this could work it's a black
swimsuit from maybe when I got my first
car lack and sequined and roughly 20,000
sizes too small for me triangles are
like this big
and also the bottoms are completely up
my ass and not the good kind of swimsuit
up your ass way like the bad kind where
it's just like alright everything just a
hundred times too too small sorry like
well okay I guess I'm gonna wear that
because it was easier that or an
oversized sweatshirt with a tomato
ketchup stain on it so the winner was
the sequins black swimsuit so usually I
would wear heels to an event like this
because you know I'm supposed to look
classy and nice and at least halfway
presentable um but what do I have in my
car I had the dirty flip-flops that I
wore to yoga and the only other thing
that I have in my car is nude flat a bit
aren't even mine or my friends so they
are a 9 and a half and I am a 7 but that
was my only option so I threw those on -
so my outfit looked great mind you
that's acitivity iceberg and let's not
forget that me physically in my own self
is also disgusting so my outfit sucks
but I'm wearing not a lick of makeup at
all
my hair literally looks like the poop
emoji is sitting on top of my head and I
smell um I smell like a farm so how am I
gonna make this work um when I'm getting
paid to go to an event to look nice and
I look like a trash can
ding bright idea I like find some
sunglasses they're like completely
oversized and I was like alright yeah
like this is gonna be fine I look great
and these sunglasses no one will know
that I'm not wearing makeup if I keep
these sunglasses on the whole time even
inside flawless plan flawless and of
course the crowning glory my hair what
the hell am I going to do about my rat
ball nest hair alright so those of you
who've been living under a rock and
don't know this I wear extensions have
been wearing extensions for a hundred
billion years these are my good
extensions but in the
of my car I find what I used to refer to
as my ocean weave my ocean weave is what
I used to wear in the ocean like it was
disgusting it was like literally matted
up hair from that I would wear to like
beach photo shoots so it had salt water
in it and chlorine in it and any shoe
that I would ever do that involved water
when I didn't want to ruin my beautiful
nice hair I would use this thing so it
was but it was either back or a keep my
little rat nest hairball in my head I
was like you know what I'm just gonna
throw these in its vine since I'm in
such a rush at this point I literally
don't even put them in right I like
threw it in clipped a couple of the
clips and the rest are like hanging down
as like you know what it's fine I just
gotta get to this party because at this
point I'm gonna be late so I speed up to
this mega mansion in the Hollywood Hills
where everyone is beautiful and great
and the guest list is like a lot of
a-list people there I'm not gonna really
explain because I'm under contract but
you get the picture so I walk into the
party and everyone is visibly alarmed by
what I look like it was like the doors
opens and I walked in and everyone was
like so I just try to keep it together
I'm like huh
yes this was normal so but I'm supposed
to look like uh amber and I was like yes
hello unfortunately I am amber um no the
cool thing about this job is you're
literally just kind of getting paid to
hang out at the party like there's no
real duties you just kind of sit around
and take pictures and do whatever you
want so I think okay I can just get to
the pool that would be at least a reason
that I look so insane mission get to the
pool commences now so I go down and find
the pool and thankfully by the way I'm
not the only model booked for this event
there's like maybe five or six of my
other social media friends there so I
was like thank God and they all they all
look freaking beautiful uh like their
hair and makeup is all done they're like
lounging by the pool like Oh looking
amazing and I roll up looking like
pee-wee Herman I mean so if I just get
in the pool at least there will be a
reason that I look so tragic so all
right I'm just gonna get in the pool
they're like oh yeah like let's take
picture isn't like let's not take
pictures but I guess that is what we're
there to get paid to do so I was like
okay we'll take some pictures but first
I'm going to get fully submerged in the
water because that just seemed like a
good idea the worst idea ever so I go
under the water the look and I coming up
ah yes and I'm like luxuriating and like
kind of half posing and trying to look
sexy even though I look terrible because
like you know what it's just in the mood
it's how you feel and then I see my hair
is kind of like out of the corner of my
eye I see that it you know like normally
hair is in the water it's like bobbing
around your shoulders but it's kind of
far ish away than I more remember and I
was like wow my hair's been getting
really long lately I didn't even notice
until I realize it's really far away
from me like it's not anywhere near me
in fact at all and I was like like this
and that's what I realize my weave is
literally floating away from me like
it's completely detached from my head
like bloo-bloop floating away about to
fly off the edge of the infinity pool
and everyone all of the girls at the
party are like oh my god don't worry
since they're my friends they're totally
laughing with me but a low-key they are
definitely also laughing at me so I'm
trying to like scoop my run away weave
out of the water and I'm like oh trying
to have clip it back in but it's not
working because it's literally a matted
ball of wet hair now so it literally is
just dangling off my head and like what
looks like a giant piece of brown
cauliflower just like wooo I'm like oh
my god I'm glittery most embarrassing
thing in my life but thank God nobody
else saw except my girlfriend until I
look up and what do I see literally no
exaggeration a balcony of like maybe ten
really really hot male models crying of
laughter like literally tears and I was
like I actually can't believe this there
have never been hot men at literally any
of these parties that I have ever worked
but of course at this one where my weave
literally floats away from me there's
ten sitting in perfect views staring
right at me
the best part is this I wasn't even
allowed to leave after that because I
was fully booked for the next four hours
so I just had to stay at the party and
mingle and pretend like the most
mortifying thing in my life didn't just
happen to me and literally everyone at
the party news they were living so
that's the girl whose hair floated away
I just can't believe that happened to me
Oh God
I will literally never be hired by them
and can title it when you read floats
away from you at an event can you model
for them anymore no the answer is no so
that is the story of when my refloated
away from me at a a list party event so
I have just killing the game lately um I
don't know what the world the story is I
guess don't try to go to events after
you do hot yoga such a stupid moral of
the story I guess the real moral of the
story is allure to laugh at yourself
even in embarrassing situations um
you're gonna be okay I'm still alive and
kicking even though that was like Oh
anyways uh thanks for watching that is
