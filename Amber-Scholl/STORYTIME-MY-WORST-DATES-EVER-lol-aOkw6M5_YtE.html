back to my channel and if you're new
hello and welcome to a wonderful video
to start our relationship outright today
if you can't tell by the title of this
we are going to be doing things a little
differently so usually I have you know
like a fun craft or a fun outfit to show
you or some fun something to do but not
today today I thought it would be fun to
throw all my morals aside and tell you
guys all the juicy details behind my
love life now I'm getting but um since
you guys are always asking about my love
life I just thought it'd be funny to do
a little bit of tak sailing and tell you
guys about all of the worst dates I've
ever been on because let me tell you I
have a lot and what good is going on
dates if you're not going to spill the
beans to the whole internet right now
I'm getting but uh not really I guess
because I am building this video so here
we go without further ado 100% true
unretouched stories of the worst dates
I've ever been on
and I'll warn you they're like really
bad
alright are you ready guys here we go so
we are going to start this video off
with the date that really inspired this
whole video because it was hands down
the worst one that I've ever been on so
the story behind this one is I had
actually gone out with this guy forever
ago he lives out of town and we just
like never really talked after we went
out the first time but he had texted me
and said hey I'm in your city do you
want to go out let me take you out
tonight
uh-huh and I was like ooh okay we had so
much fun the first time he was so great
had a great personality was super fun um
so I figured you know why not I'll say
yes and then right after I agree to come
he stops responding for like 10 hours so
now it's like 9:15 I'm tired I want to
go to bed I'm pissed but I don't want to
be the one to text him first so I was
like I'm not going to talk to him like
when we're around but then I just
decided you know whatever who cares what
do I have to lose so I texted him and
was like hey like are we doing anything
question mark question mark question
mark it's really late like I want to go
to bed I don't usually go out this late
and he calls me immediately and says oh
my gosh of course
yeah like get ready we're going and I
was like what the heck why didn't you
respond to me all day long anyways
whatever I forgive him because his voice
on the phone is so charming and so I
think you know sure yo won me over
mistake so he asks me if I want to meet
him at catch at 10 which is like this
super trendy really great fancy
expensive restaurant I'm here in LA and
so I was like woo I'm excited yeah so I
get an uber head over there and I
decided to show up fashionably late I
show up like 15 minutes late and so I
pull up and I text him I was like hey
I'm here and he texts me back and says
okay great I'm finishing up I'll be down
in a minute
so I'm like excuse me I thought we were
gonna go get drinks that catch together
but no he was already eating there
I don't know went oh maybe he was on
another date who knows but he doesn't
even have the courtesy to like invite me
up he just says I'll be down in a sec
wait there so I'm thinking okay I'll
wait here for like a minute mind you
it's just like on the street just
literally on a street I'm just standing
in the street dressed fabulously but
that's a sign complete so I'm waiting
there and I think it's going to be like
you know five minutes or whatever but no
no no no I waited for like 20 minutes
for him to finally come downstairs and
meet me and I was like at that point
very unamused very honest and right as
I'm about to call an uber home he walks
out of the restaurant and is like hey
babe and oh you know he was just so cute
and dressed so well and um I you know
all of my anger left me immediately so
we hop in a giant uber black he's also
in the entertainment business
so that was super fun and he goes okay
so we're going to go pick up my two
friends and I'm thinking oh you know
what he probably has cool friends
because you know he's cool he'll be fun
to go out with someone else
doubling this super black takes us into
a literal back alley like I don't know
where we were it was dark and so creepy
and I was thinking what in the world and
into the car hops a belligerently drunk
man and a girl who looks like she can't
see two feet in front of her and I'm
thinking okay who are these people and
he says this is my best friend and I'm
thinking oh good lord so we roll up to
this little place called Bootsy bellows
which used to be really popular way back
in the day but now is like hmm we hop
out of it ooh BRR and there is a massive
line of people like it looks like
there's a two-hour line to get into this
club even on a Tuesday night club going
up on a Tuesday in LA is actually a real
thing I'm like huh you know it's going
to be fine at least we have a table we
can just walk right in know the drunk
guy and the random girl looked at me and
we're like so how do we get in and if
you've never been to a club in LA you
probably don't understand this but like
you can't go to clubs without
table here because you'll wait in line
for like three hours outside and then
once you get in you're just going to be
like smushed on the floor with 30,000
other people and it's truly just a
miserable experience so what do you guys
doing they just expect me to get us in
somehow because I live in LA and know
everyone secret time I actually used to
be a big club rat back in my younger
days so I actually did know the bouncer
and I actually could get us just to walk
right in so we walked into some other
random persons table up in front hanging
out whatever if I'm just kind of sitting
there like hmmm because I really don't
like clubs anymore I'm talking to my guy
and his weird friend and the random girl
and then all of a sudden the girl goes I
need to go to bathroom and just stands
up in the middle of our conversation and
like walks away so I was like all right
you know I see you later
but then she literally never comes back
like I don't know where she went and I
asked his friend like who was that and
he says I have no idea just some girl I
met earlier we were hooking up at my
house and then she just left me here so
now I figure this is just going to be a
really weird night I might as well just
enjoy it
so we're dancing having fun and then
like I said my date is also in the
entertainment industry and easily
recognizable so 10 minutes until a large
group of girls recognized who I was
there with like five of them come over
and are like oh we love you blah blah
blah not being discreet about it at all
they're just like all over him and he
didn't seem to care he was just living
his best life like he didn't try to ward
them off he didn't try to like being all
I'm here with someone like nothing he
would just sit in there like living and
having a grand old time so despite the
fact of being ignored isn't really my
vibe I just kind of was like I don't
think I should leave quite yet I bet
this is going to get funnier and boy am
I so glad I stayed so finally after two
hours of just standing there being
completely ignored watching all the
other girls hit on my date who didn't
seem to care in the slightest they turn
on all the lights and they say alright
you guys got to go home and immediately
when the lights turns on he gets up and
goes alright babe come on grabs my hands
and parades me out of the club and I was
like what why do all those other girls
were like what to
to tell you the truth I was more
surprised than them to be honest so as
I'm being paraded out of the club I
realized how drunk he is he is like
white girl wasted can barely stand is
slurring all of his words and isn't
really making any sense at all and at
this point I'm so over it I was like you
know what I'm just going to call an uber
and go home and he's like oh no no no no
like come to the after-party we're going
to an after-party and I was like I
really don't want to go to an
after-party and although we're having
this conversation I realized the giant
group of girls who was with us at the
table inside have followed us outside so
while he's trying to convince me to stay
there like all over him and I was like
oh my god this is just like not my vibe
I really want to go home and I don't
know how it is in other cities but in LA
there's like women outside of the clubs
holding bouquets of like hundreds of
roses and they're always like shoving
them in your face when you leave like
trying to get you to buy some of them
for your girlfriend or whoever whatever
so one of those ladies comes up to him
and is like shoving all the roses in his
face and he goes how much for all of
them and I'm thinking he is so nice he's
going to buy me all of the roses he was
that his credit card and spent 250
dollars to buy all of the roses from all
of the ladies selling all of them and I
was like oh well I'm going to forgive
him and what was this point do he gives
them to the other girls
all of the roses to the other girls who
were all over him inside not me not even
one there was like a hundred roses so I
was like wow definitely going to go home
now so I say thanks for an interesting
evening
I think I'm just going to catch an uber
and go home but he still looks bummed
out and then his crazy drunk friend
comes out from nowhere land and just
goes oh man don't worry about it I got
five girls at the crib he literally said
the crib like who still says that so I'm
horrified and I'm just like you know
what as if I didn't have enough cues to
go home this is officially the final
straw
goodnight and I turn to walk away and he
turns to his friend and is like oh man
that makes me look so bad man why you
got to say that then he turns right to
me can't even see straight
it does that creepy thing the guy do
he's like well you want to go to lunch
tomorrow
no sir I don't want to go to lunch
tomorrow so I really do leave this time
I walk up the corner to go wait for my
uber and my uber cancels on me like five
times because at this point it's like
3:30 in the morning and while I was
sitting there on the side of the road
they don't even say goodbye
they just get in a giant uber him his
friend and all the girls that were in
the club who had roses from him and
drove away and that my friends is the
story of the worst date I ever went on
by the way even after all that I was
still giving him the benefit of the
doubt because like I said we called out
before and he was so great so I kind of
figured he would text me the next day
and apologize or something no I was even
the bigger person and said hey hope you
got home okay the next day and guess
what no response and I haven't talked to
him since so like I said that was only a
couple days ago and I figured I would
tell you some of the stories from way
back when these are just gonna be a
little date snippets because I don't
want to bore you with the whole entire
stories but here are some of my dating
moment highlights so we'll call this one
the Australian guy so I meet this guy on
bumble and I figure well you know he's
going to be pretty cute based on his
pictures and I show up to the date and
he is a freakin 10 he ends up telling me
he's like a Calvin Klein model and like
all this stuff and he was in Australian
accents like six four and I was like
living my best life I was like I'm going
to marry this man so we're in his matte
black Range Rover driving to the beach
but while we're going through the hills
he stops and goes hey can you grab
something on my glove compartment for me
and I'm like oh you know yeah sure so I
open it and he goes can you hand me my
weed pen oh that's such a big turn-off
but okay so we pull over and he proceeds
to hotbox the entire car full of weeds
like just full of it and I was sitting
there like Oh until he finally looks
over and goes oh he don't mind you
or how about this one I was out at a bar
with this guy who said he wanted to take
me to dinner and then proceeded to not
want to buy any food just wanted to buy
shots and since I don't really drink
that didn't really order anything and
while we were there he whipped out his
wallet and he pulled out a literal like
Polaroid printed photobooth photo of me
and my friend at a Halloween party from
like three years ago and he said yeah I
recognized you from this photo I had and
I was like I was like who are you and
why do you have this he was like yeah I
found it in my drawer I knew I
recognized you from somewhere when I
scrolled past your profile and I got out
of there real like this one has to be
one of my favorite things that ever
happened to me on a date because even
when I think about it now I still die
laughing so um I went out with this guy
at a place called earth cafe which is
like it turned me a little sit down II
kind of like cafe here in Beverly Hills
of this man orders no food but he orders
a tea kettle and drinks the whole thing
despite it being nine o'clock at night
this is like a huge huge tea kettle and
he drinks the whole thing and I was like
that was kind of weird but it got even
weirder when he ordered another and
drank the whole thing and then he
ordered another and drink the whole
thing this man ordered three giant tea
kettles and drank all of them over the
course of like two hours and that wasn't
even the funny part though that was
pretty funny um so we're in the car and
he's driving me home and he goes you
know what I actually you want to go see
like there's a really pretty place to
see the moon up here you want to go and
I was like yeah you know what sure like
why not
so we drive all the way up into the
hills of Hollywood and like be mega
mansion neighborhoods and we're sitting
there looking at the stars and he turns
to me and says I actually have to go to
the bathroom do you mind and I would
like mmm what and he just gets up out of
the car and starts to pee in this
person's lawn like this mega mansion
lawn and I was like oh my god get back
in the car you can't do this me was like
it's fine and I was like it's not fine
there's cameras where could it be like
arrested I don't even know get back in
the car and he's like it's not a big
deal show out and then has the nerve to
try to like make out with me and I was
like oh my god dude you were just like
peeing and some stranger's llamas like
Oh so um that was really awkward the
whole ride home after that was just no
and last but not least we'll end it with
something that wasn't bad but it was
just too funny I have to include it
because I don't know where I'm going to
include this story the first tinder date
that I ever went on ever was with this
super hot super well known French model
guy and that I followed on Instagram for
years before I matched with him on
tinder so I was like so excited I went
to go meet him at a park in Beverly
Hills which I thought was going to be
super fun until I realized the language
barrier was so intense like I couldn't
understand him and he had no idea what I
was saying either at all so we ended up
just kind of like kissing on a bench I
don't know like I said I was a little
wild or back then literally in the
middle of it he got up and he does a
handstand and walks on his hands for
like forty feet like it wasn't like
doo-doo-doo it was like he was standing
on his hands
fully walking in circles around the
bench
I really couldn't contain my laughter it
was just so bizarre but he must have
thought I was enjoying it because he
literally stood up it was like tada and
then you know that thing that like
really strong people can do where they
like hold on to a pole and like can kind
of be vertically it doesn't make any
sense but here's the picture of it he
did that on a tree so I'm just standing
there in the middle of this park with a
man dangling off a tree and some like
mom and her baby walked by and I was
just like hi and it was literally so
weird and I just oh my god I will never
forget that that was most bizarre
experience of my life but um yeah I got
this nice to end on a little bit more of
a light-hearted note isn't it anyways
moral the story I guess is uh you gotta
learn to laugh at yourself because I
didn't have a sense of humor I probably
wouldn't be making this video so thank
you guys so much for watching um I hope
you guys at least got a good laugh out
of it because like I said what good are
my bad dates if I don't get to share
them with the whole internet right I
love you guys so very much don't forget
to subscribe to the channel because I'm
sure I'll go on a lot more horrible date
soon but my mom's probably gonna yell at
me about making this video do you think
no one's ever gonna ask you out again
knowing you're going to tell her story
on the Internet
well maybe we'll treat me better this
time
you're still out there single like me
don't forget one of my favorite quotes
I've ever heard
what's the queen without her king a
frickin queen I love you guys get this
till next time my angels XO
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
