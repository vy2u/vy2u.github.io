face beauties hi guys so in case you
can't tell by how cheesy I am right now
I am so so excited for today's video
this is something I've been dying to do
for a long time so let me just explain
it because I'm going to ramble for 30
minutes I'm too excited so let me gather
my thoughts mm-hmm okay here we go
so today in the spirit of the
back-to-school season I thought it would
be fun to go back-to-school shopping
um but since I graduated high school in
2011 and graduated college in 2015 I
most certainly do not need to go
back-to-school shopping
anytime soon but but since I still
didn't want to miss out on all the fun
I figured since you guys have given me
so much more than I could have ever
imagined I would take this opportunity
to go ahead and give back to some of you
guys and take you a back to school
shopping so I reached out and picked two
of my lucky subscribers one going into
high school and one going into her
freshman year of college
and I'm going to take them back to
school shopping so I'm going to go meet
them for brunch in like 20 minutes I'm
so excited but I'm so nervous because
I've like never met them and this is
just going to be so fun I just I could
crush thinking about how excited I am
for this so instead of me just standing
in front of my mirror like teasing for
the next 40 minutes um we are going to
go ahead and go pick them up and meet
them for brunch so without further ado
here we go a very extra back to school
shopping featuring my beloved subscriber
angels okay here we go
of course before we get going I just
want to say a huge thank you to the
wonderful generous sponsors of today's
video a wonderful app called snuff has
agreed to sponsor the trip and is going
to pay for all the clothes for the girls
so thank you so much for letting me do
this I wouldn't be able to do this
without you guys so thank you just for
basically a super easy closet organizer
and socializer it acts as a virtual log
for all your kids live without items
it's so fun interested you guys on yet
another platform and you guys know I
always post a lot of crazy photos of my
clothes on Instagram but it's really fun
to have some like more organized and I
can share a couple more on there you can
map out your outfits people other people
are wearing and I can tag where I bought
it how much I bought it for
I even have like a little group called
my very extra closet so if you want to
see even more of my clothes they're all
identical so to say thank you to the
wonderful people and to have a chance at
winning my next little shopping contest
make sure you download the app and join
my group and post in there and interact
with me on there because um it's super
fun and I want to be able to take the
crown shopping too so I'm good note
