Olympic Games our competitors this year
have come from long and far far and wide
running sleep they've been doing
everything they can in preparation for
today's games so who will win the
coveted crown today we'll find out just
kidding
I actually really need a new moustache
this one's like getting all that stuff
but anyways what about sweet pumpkin
pies it's amber welcome back to my
channel and today it might not be the
official Olympic Games but we are going
to do a little bit of friendly
competition with the holidays coming up
there's no better time to rock a red lip
so I thought we would just go ahead and
test them all out and see which one is
the best for puckering your pout under
the mistletoe or just taking fire
selfies ooh
so without further ado here we go the
first annual red lipstick Olympics
so you can see we've got all the
beautiful red lipsticks Oh Benjamin
you're interrupting my video I'm gonna
make a DIY so I was texting him earlier
anyways so back to the red lipsticks um
you can see we just have a bunch of
different red ones and I have a full
Sephora bag in here so we're just
literally going to get to testing them
so we're gonna go ahead and prep our
lips with a sugar scrub and some
chapstick just to make sure they're all
smooth and ready for the Olympics so
here we go but I don't know great okay
alrighty there we go we got the red
lipstick all removed on my lips to look
a little pink because I was a stay and
so I could stain them a little bit but I
love it by the way before we get started
with this I would just like to say I am
NOT a beauty guru I'm not a makeup
expert I am literally nothing this is
just me sitting in my house trying on a
bunch of lipsticks so take everything
with a grain of salt but uh here is my
humble opinion alrighty so like I said
we've got a billion of them so now in no
particular order here is our first
contestant Smashbox all right so first
we have the Smashbox liquid lip so you
can see it comes in a super cute little
container and it went on super smooth
you can see it's very low well it all
looked great until I cut it over my
teeth so we'll fix that off-camera but
to know there we go honestly for the
first one I'm really impressed I'm gonna
go ahead and give this one a solid 9 out
of 10 next we have the NYX lip ink which
I went ahead and tried on I honestly
didn't love this just because it was
kind of really thin it doesn't really
look fantastic so we're gonna go ahead
and layer it on with another one of
their lipsticks I didn't like the night
to layer them but for the pretty color
and even prettier price point we're
gonna go ahead and give this one a 7 out
of 10
next we have good old colour-pop
cosmetics which I got to say I'm biased
too but because I've been using them for
years it's just so soft and it's made in
the same factory as the Kylie cosmetics
lip stuff so that's pretty cool it goes
on really smooth and actually smells
awesome which is like so random but you
know fun fact I'll be honest actually
really don't like the color of this one
that I picked today but all things
considered a side of the color which was
you know my own fault we're gonna go
ahead and give colour-pop a 9 out of 10
next up we got good old NARS because is
actually the sample I got from Sephora
because I was too cheap to buy it
whatever so gonna go ahead and put this
on and ooh
I was shook by this the second I put it
on you can see it is just like wow you
can see my mouthing my excitement I was
really shocked by this one wow look at
that they almost look like those candy
lips you get on Halloween you know what
I'm talking about
yeah those we're like twins ten out of
ten sold
back to the drugstore brands we've got
some Revlon lipstick here this wine in a
darker berry color I wasn't loving it
mostly because I don't really like
lipsticks that are shiny especially
because it comes off really easily like
not good for a long wear so I'm gonna go
ahead and give this one a 5 out of 10
not my fav we're getting wet wild with
wet and wild this is the wet and wild
lip cream this was the softest one that
I tried on of any of them I don't really
love the orange color but you know that
was my fault so there we go
solid nine out of ten and the kiss
ability on this one look at that nothing
this is great ooh soft and pretty hmm
who knew switching gears from drugstore
to do your you can see this is actually
a super cute little lipstick it comes in
a cool fancy packaging which is a nice
bonus this is actually probably the
favorite and actual lipstick that I
tried on just because the color was
really nice it went on smooth and
weirdly enough it smells really good
kind of like flowers or something so
there we go
shout out to do your you make a nice
lipstick we're gonna give this one a
solid eight next up so for a brand I
usually love Sephora brands because it's
a cheap dupe for all the expensive
products long-wear soft it looks good on
your lips so we're gonna give this one
um I don't know why I suddenly have is
it now didn't have is it in the
beginning in this video what the heck so
anyway I'm pretty impressed with almost
everything I've tried on today so I'm
gonna go ahead and give this one a 9 out
of 10 moving right along next we have
keels you can see this one is actually
cool it looks like a chapstick because
dun-da-da-da it is a chapstick I
actually messed this up and I bought a
chapstick instead of lipstick oops I
really got to start meeting labels
better so he's disqualified from the
competition for not having a fair chance
but if you're looking for a good
chapstick would recommend Kat Von D that
was not an intro at all but that's fine
okay here we go this is the Kat Von D
liquid lips which I've heard great
reviews of so I was really excited to
try it this color is freaking fantastic
ludie red oh my gosh I literally loved
it I guess that's probably why it's
called Vampira or Vampira I don't know
how you actually pronounce this but who
cares only thing I could say about this
one is it really didn't go on super
evenly like you can see when it's all
dried it kind of looks patchy a little
bit I don't know probably user error
because like I said not a professional
but I'm gonna go ahead and say I just
kind of messed this one up because a lot
of people really love these um
personally I'm gonna give it a 6 I think
if I did it right a prob
would have been a 10 so up to you try it
in the store decide for yourself
and now the Anastacio glow kit except
this is lipstick so it has nothing to do
with glow kit but you know whatever who
cares so this is the UH Nastasia lip
good lips which I have also heard great
things about and this one I was shocked
by the color and the consistency oh my
god
like look at how good this is Wow I
could watch my own lip application for
like a hundred years and it would never
get old
actually it would but oh look at that it
looks like the ads on Instagram oh wow
the only thing I could say about this
one is it gets really dry and crusty so
make sure you put on chapstick before it
but other than that damn can I say damn
probably we're gonna give this a ten out
of ten moving right along - steela
but it might be Stila I don't actually
know I don't think I've ever heard
anyone pronounce it so this one you can
see is super cute I think this is also a
sample size I borrowed it from my
roommate so you can see it's a really
nice shade of fire-engine red went on
super soft smooth again pretty color
really soft decent kiss ability it's
actually really nice so we'll go ahead
and give it an 8 lips are almost
starting to get tired from all this on
and off of the makeup they're like so
swollen but anyways we still got a
couple more so here we go ooh la la
Coco Chanel feelin fancy again with the
designer duds because I'm borrowing it
for my roommate again I didn't want to
spend my life savings on this video so
here you can see this is actually a red
gloss which is super potent for a gloss
very shiny and shimmery whoo speaking of
my roommates you just turn on the faucet
okay nice color so pretty impressed 9
out of 10 next up we have elf cosmetics
just in time for the holidays but did
you know what elf actually stands for
eyes lips face I had no idea until I
googled it so here we have the elf
cosmetics lip stain which was super
cheap and affordable elf is great about
that definitely more of a lipstick but
you can see it's thin and more I mean
not natural but like slightly more
natural than the other ones I really
don't have much staying power so you can
see that like kind of almost removed it
but as far as lipsticks go it's pretty
nice so we'll give it a 7 Katie cat
matte what a great name for lipstick so
this is the cover girl by Katy Perry
collab we've got it really nice the red
lipstick here this is really smooth
looks nice you have to put a couple
layers on to make sure it looks really
good but whoo look at that I kissed a
girl
okay great fantastic so back to the
lipsticks the only thing is it said
matte and this is not really matte this
is still kind of shiny so we'll go ahead
and give this one a seven really on the
drugstore train here we've got L'Oreal
infallible lip stain which is a really
close dupe to the smashbox one you can
see the brushes shaped the same and it
looks really really similar really soft
really potent as far as the drugstore
ones that i've tried so far this is the
closest to a high-end one that i've
found so ooh I like it
we're actually gonna give this one a 9
high scorer also I've been trying to get
this off for 10 minutes you can see this
is not kidding about the long wear like
I am literally oh my god am I gonna have
to end on this one I literally cannot
get it off last but not least we've got
Maybelline coming in clutch so here we
go we've got their lip stain which is
actually a beautiful color this is my
favorite the deeper Reds I love love
love this one actually went on pretty
good the only thing was it wasn't a
hundred percent matte it was definitely
still a little shiny and also really
kind of smells like baby powder to me so
this ability is low - mmm first deign
not good so I'm gonna give this one a 5
not really a huge fan but I don't know
just my humble opinion yeah thank you

award ceremony of the lipstick Olympics
