amber wear something casual bling-bling
I'm ready what's up guys if amber and
welcome back to my channel and if you're
new hello and greetings to the
sparkliest place on earth so today is it
you guys been asked me to do look books
I thought it would be fun to go ahead
and kick off my little look book series
by I'm doing what I do best
being freaking extra house so today I'm
just going to go through my closet and
try on my most fabulously sparkly fluffy
booing tastic outfits for you guys
because I don't know sounds like fun to
me
so here's expel the official sparkliest
one book on youtube and kicking off the
lookbook with my most extra look
basically on that I've ever worn I am
obsessed with this look at this this is
Kendall's 21st birthday dress oh my god
I paired it with my favorite ever white
fluffy faux fur coat I actually got this
in London for like $20 on the sign of
the street um if you guys want to see my
London shopping vlog it's in there but I
am just obsessed with this coat like I
was literally looking your mine through
and the other day and basically every
single photo is me and this coach
because I love you so much I wear it all
the time like you guys literally oh look
at all the crystals on this oh my god
it's so ha even the booty look at that
sparkly booty
whoa whoo and of course I paired it with
my knockoff Giuseppe's an audience they
literally look exactly like the real
thing what goes better with diamonds the
diamond so I paired it with this diamond
D choker and
roll up to the PTA meeting like what
good you guys ooh yes but boom alright
here we go here's the next look at this
you might actually recognize from a
Haley Baldwin was actually wearing this
in one of her last Instagram oh look at
this so beautiful so extra oh my god I
am a living not to mention this is like
the softest outfit ever because it's
made of some really pretty silk oh and
it matches my nails look at that that
does like oh my god just look at the
aesthetic of the top with the choker so
look at it fish I went ahead and pair
this look with my nice nude easy dupes
because I don't know they're pretty
totally sexy Sasquatch labs with this
jacket I like to pair with it sometimes
like look itself
yeah oh it's just so freaking beautiful
I love it I'm a living Oh
literally the cutest outfit in the world
yes yeah we go oh the fence the
jellyfish look so I took a few off of
Kylie Jenner in the latest Instagram
post and I thought it would be super fun
to go ahead and copy the look like a
body chain because I can't afford custom
Moshi no but um or milski no I don't
even know how you frickin sign on but
there we go so I went ahead I just
paired a body pain with a regular black
top and black bottom so fun it looks
amazing very high fashion II and cool
even though is literally I got this body
chain downtown for like $23 yeah a top
and bottom I think I got these from my
god I don't even know probably forever
21 that's where I get everything I of
course spared the crazy look with some
crazy boots I have used for misguided
you might recognize them from my New
Year's Eve video but so cool I love
these boots like I said they were cheap
there were like $30 so super cute tada
boom boom boom
vogue jellyfish on the ride so what even
is going on in this look I don't know
but I mean I told you it was an extra
love bus you cooked on it basically what
we've got going on here is a crazy mesh
see-through rose gold dress it's got
basically a crotch saw crotch - so
that's fun and it shows off my banger
shoes that you guys are always asking
about in the background on my shoe wall
so cute they're from public desire only
like 45 bucks - so so fun okay even I'll
admit this look is like really weird but
I don't know I'm gonna put it in the
video anyway with Rihanna wear this
probably not actually but that's okay
alright so they're probably the
classiest of all the looks I've got
today we've got this white fluff busting
that back out we've got this very glow
pants suit what do you think would
Hillary Clinton wear this anyway so I
just going to go ahead flip this off my
shoulders you can kind of see what this
looks like but basically it's that same
crop top without the Diamonds that I was
wearing earlier and then it comes with
these a Bangor pants that I have never
seen anything quite like these before it
almost looks like a maxi skirt but
they're literally pants you can see like
when you're walking it's like a fashion
show it's a runway it's like a nice
little surprise whoo look at that how
fun so you can see it's just like
luxurious oh I'm going to literally fall
over I don't know why I'm I think this
up I paired it with these supercool YSL
dupes so beautiful make your legs look
extra long and pretty and of course it
wouldn't be amber so let me know look if
you didn't do something really weird
like matching your husband perks they
are fuzzy jacket so you know boom there

to wear this success when I'm 23 and
having fun

craziest-looking grandma in town Sam
where in the world did you get this
amber I know I know where would anyone

and it still remains one of my favorite
things I've ever worn ever I just love
it it's so extra I had bought the skirt
and then like cut it and sewed it myself
to be like this full length um tulle
whatever you even want to call this so
cool and this top is actually from a
little company called daze boutique so
cute I've got that on line so adorable
