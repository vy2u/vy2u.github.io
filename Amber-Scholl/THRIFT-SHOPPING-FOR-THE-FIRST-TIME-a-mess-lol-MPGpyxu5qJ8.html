welcome back to my channel and what's
good if you're new hello welcome to I
just realized it looks like I'm not
wearing pants I am wearing pants you
guys they're just like booty shorts cut
off there we go
I mean I don't wear pants in a lot of my
videos but anyways I'm getting
distracted so that's to what I'm
actually talking about so you guys are
only asking if I've ever been a thrift
shopping and a side of going to Goodwill
every so often to get stuff for DIY
projects the answer is honestly no as so
I thought today it would be super fun to
go ahead and go on my first-ever
thrifting adventure and of course take
you guys along for the ride so I'm not
really sure where we're going to go what
we're going to find or what exactly
we're doing here but uh you know it'll
be an adventure so without further ado
here we go amber goes drifting
all righty so before we go here is our
outfit of the day and oversized Calvin
Klein t-shirt fabulous faux Gucci bag
ash don't go and of course my sunglasses
and my hair with some cool sneakers that
I got downtown um I accidentally wore
them to the beach the other day so
they're like really dirty but so cute
so look lifted hi baby
oh I love you you're so cute
hi oh hey hi Wow what about oh so that's
what what it was today
all right like I said I'm not really
sure where we're going but we're going
to try to find something by the way I
know it looks like I'm not driving I'm
not driving I just happen to have like
50 holler to lift credit so I'm just
taking like a lift black in my memory
self whoo all righty so I googled best
store shop close to me and this is what
came up so does the first place we're
gonna try all right here we go
jet rag vintage clothing let's check it
out
this is going to be great
what amazing and look at all of those oh
my god
maybe I should live in a thrift store oh
my god literally oh look at this place
Wow look how aesthetically pleasing this
is everything all in matching color
order oh I love it honestly what kind of
life have I been living without Oh fake
obviously but now you need an aesthetic
this is literally not even different
than my everyday attire
queen of the world
whoo what a pretty baller I don't know
who Jack is but maybe he can be my
boyfriend
whoa flannel nation this place is
actually so cool I'm Olaf hey oh my god
this fabric ah here we go
now this is what I'm talking about oh my
god honestly a fashion back in the day
was so lit like imagine showing up your
best friend's wedding in this iconic and
look like a pink tulip cupcake
alrighty that was fun but nothing I
would really like actually buy and wear
so we're gonna go ahead and try some
well alrighty next stop muffler exchange
let's see hey hey hey this could be cool
bad day these are literally huge and
falling off my feet but they would have
been really cool
someone will be lucky this is actually
super cute but like I don't know so
practice are like dirty
I don't really drive with that so I
don't know you guys for shopping isn't
really going quite as I thought hmm
womp well kid I didn't really love that
either so now what can make you my BFF
we're going to wasteland which based on
the title doesn't sound too interesting
but hey we'll give it a try
alright this place is kind of cool maybe
we'll have something fun
woo they already have something fun in
here this is pretty cool really in bad
shape we're kind of cool nonetheless hmm
what else we got in here like this is
totally cool but I'm at a first store
and it's still $1,200 Oh
hmm mm-hmm
this will be cool it's the fenty
sweatshirt but it's got a stain on it
and it's still 128 I don't think I like
this I just don't think I do
already here we go what favorite good
old good will this place never fails me
so let's see there's bound to be
something fun in here ah my favorite
because it's so big and so vast and full
of such random stuff but it has so many
things I mean just literally so much
stuff in here it's almost impossible not
to find something so I can't find
anything in here I give up
oh so many shoes well ours only one whew
Steve Madden $9.00 unfortunately they're
not my size but I would have been a cool
find and the prices in here are amazing
ooh goodwill is fun hmm mm-hmm
hello this is cute but it's literally so
short I mean you know something short I
say it's short this is where I buy all
my furniture for my DIYs look at it all
so many possibilities
if I brought this element of it in our
kitchen I think my roommates would
literally kill me honestly not really
finding too much stuff today it's just
not really I mean these are sparkly but
I know I'm just like not real calm
actually whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
okay just kidding I have to try these oh
my god honestly these are literally the
coolest shoes in the world like oh my
goodness
remember when you had those saddle shoes
when we were like six and they were like
the coolest thing in the world many of
em loves us I love it I love it
I'm not just made all the failures worth
it fufufu you okay get out of here
before I like fall over
really loud trying to film on two three
anyways we're just gonna go ahead and
try one next place crossroads team fun
there we go all right so this looks a
lot like Buffalo Exchange just like a
really big horse full of stuff from I
think the biggest problem that I have
with these things is like these are cool
and these are cool so but then they
don't have it in your size we only have
one parent so hmm-hmm-hmm add for them
to bring this down off the wall look at
this $42.00 oh okay blue blue my
favorite designer look at that we've got
some pretty little levers the only thing
is this is a size 10 so it's like oh I
do it well by the where you go bye guys
I read it to support I'm eating my hair
but I read it to subscribers I thought
every Sunday I hi anything you want to
say to the Internet oh no I'm just a big
fan and it was fun goofiness you yeah
alright well it's all back to being sad
about this
I'm kind of swimming in it but if I get
it ticket bitten look at that if I give
it a 2 min I will have a Versace skirt
for $40
decisions it took all the and
everything one hello guys so in case you
can't tell we are back in my Casa
because I actually went to like four
more stores after that and it really
just did not have any success so I'm
just going to go ahead and do a quick
little haul for you guys and when I say
quick let me tell you it's quick and we
bought one thing piece but stare amazing
literally look how cute these shoes are
I just loved them and they were
literally nine dollars so nab those from
Goodwill and that is literally the only
thing that I bought honestly I kinda was
disappointed I thought I was going to
like love thrifting because I love
budget shopping but some kind of made me
sad that they didn't have a lot of
strings in my size are exactly what I
was looking for so I think I prefer my
regular cheap downtown forever 21
shopping adventures but maybe I just did
it wrong I don't know so if you have any
better tips I'm not opposed to trying it
again so let me know in the comments a
totally random side note though there
are a ton of hot men when you go Fripp
shopping i was so surprised I ran into
like a million hot people and I kept
trying to film them to like show them
you guys but they kept turning around
and noticing so I was really awkward
that's like low key one of the reasons I
had to cut my shopping adventure short
but anyways um so as always thank you
guys so much for watching um you have

socials are at Amber Shoals you can hit
