here we go whatever could say something
um well it actually looks like kind of
like I'm naked so let me just move this
up a little what's up guys and ambered
welcome back to my channel and we got a
special guest in LA I'm Brendon except
it's actually not my house as you can
tell this is his house so let you guys
know this is the second time we're
filled with Estelle what happened yeah
no I know I told you guys a little bit
but yeah I got robbed
we filmed good video someone broke into
my car stole my laptop yeah so we did
this already at my house but we're going
to do it again yeah so uh basically
anyways I'd realize I didn't explain
this I really like the boyfriend tags I
thought it'd be funny to do what
boyfriend does my voiceover since I
don't have a boyfriend I thought I'd use
a tinder date so uh that's me you guys
go to the store like literally was like
a year year ago we matched on tinder and
like yeah we literally met - the first
time we filmed a video oh no no no we
met actually on the we met 101 other
time yes
but like that real time like first time
ever hanging out was the last time we
sold it to you before she got robbed
yeah oh my gosh
so yeah that's the little backstory on
that so here we go round two but the
first time you guys are ever seeing it
so let's do it
does my voiceover
whoo guys yeah I think it's not anything
honey yeah no any hey guys it's amber
here and I'm just touching my face
before I put all this beautiful makeup
on oh wait I have an idea let's put
makeup forever on HD oh my god first I'm
going to rub this crayon shaped marker
on us oh my god just changed skin tones
I am no longer a pale white girl I have
a little bit of a tan white girl and
this looks real nice yeah as you can
tell you got it on my lips a little bit
but we're gonna get that out later next
thing we have is the Mozart palette this
palette is for making contour I believe
this is contour or this is just tiger
stripes regardless it's going to look
good in the end so now we're going with
a real darker shade I really don't know
why I put it on my forehead like that
but I'm guessing it's going to look good
now we're doing on the nose the nose has
got to look good at all times this is
literally creating a new nose plastic
surgery happen but we don't need plastic
surgery when we have contour now we're
going to rub this contour all in and
look at that wow I didn't even know this
was going to happen I am amazed right
now this blending technique that I have
going on here is called the amber blend
it's a blend where I just kind of blend
and I say kind of it now we have the
contour look it looks real good I look a
little bit darker now we have the next
palettes I mean powders and we're going
to rub this all over our face just to
kind of blend everything in make it all
look good now I'm going to smile to the
camera show how cute I look next we're
going to pull out the true match skin
color thing where I rub on my face on
the contour okay this is more contour I
believe or a bronzer I think they're
both the same thing
but regardless then I'm going to put it
on line just a little bit now we have
the Anastasia brow well you know this is
not brows this is highlight obviously a
highlight we're going to rub the
highlight you highlight is always got to
be popping you have to put on oh my god
that's what I just said
now you got to put the highlight on line
on my nose I believe there's my nose
yeah this is my nose what about I get
next we have is another palette this is
a van Gogh mark 3 palette this is for
eyeshadow you put it our believe it's
eyeshadow this is highlight I don't know
I'm putting it under my eye yes it is
eye shadow okay we put it on the eye
just to kind of give my eye that extra
look you know like that look where it's
just like I'm ready to party but I'm
also ready to steal your husband this is
the look that we're going for and this
is the kind of my daily routine
I go for this look all the time I've
only stolen three husbands so far but
that's not a big deal let's talk about
that later next we have this glitter
look this clear look is going to say pop
star in the making this look is going to
tell you guys that you don't want to
mess with me because I will feel your
father and I've done it before
so don't tempt me the next thing we have
going on is the under eye liner which is
actually like this nice magenta tone
that matches the top part of my eye
it all goes just trust me the next thing
we have is we're going to start working
on the wing we're going to do an inner
wing and we might even do an outer wing
I don't know haven't seen that far in
the video yet oh yeah we are definitely
doing an outer wing look at this leave
this this Picasso could not draw a
sharper wing if he tried but pop scott
also did a lot of like you know rounded
edges and stuff but that's not a good
definition let's let's you can keep
going with this look at that look at
that wing that wing could honestly stab
me in the throat stabbed me right in the
jugular with that next we have is for
the eyebrows okay so in case you don't
have the most thick eyebrows in the
world that's no problem because I'm
going to show you how to thicken your
eyebrows right up first you grab this
crayon marker ink thing and you put it
all over your eyebrows look how dark
they're starting to become they're
looking like real eyebrows actually now
and believe it or not most people think
they are real eyebrows but they're not
they're just very much colored in so as
you can tell you as my real eyebrow
here's my big eyebrow which one looks
better tell me in the comments now we're
going to put on the eyelashes these ones
are not mink or anything animal related
you know because I don't support that
but look how beautiful they look
they're real that's a no-no I was just
reading that thing next we're doing the
under eyelash thing and look how
beautiful this looks wow this is HD next
we have is the lip liner you always want
to line your lips it gives it a little
extra plump a little extra sass and it
says that you're ready to eat some bit
next next we have is this cute little
lip look see actually colored my whole
lip with this lip liner in case you like
wearing lipstick you can also throw that
