amber do you notice anything different
today mmm that's right we're not my room
we're in my kitchen I don't know why but
you guys wanted to see me film somewhere
else so here I am featuring a crock pot
and some dirty dishes are you guys sure
you wanted to see this anyway it's not
important not what this video is about
so as you can tell by keys in hand we're
going to go on a shopping adventure
today and I'm going to show you guys the
best places to shop for home dorm room
bedroom everything decor because I moved
quite a few times and after going to
college and decorating my room in a new
apartment let me tell you if there's one
thing that I do know how to do it's fine
fabulous home decor on a budget and that
looks super cute so today I'm going to
take you with me and show you the best
places to go guys we're kicking off the
video with my favorite place of all oh
good
home cook is basically the greatest
store in the history of all time ever
I'm like such a suburban housewife I
come here all the time and just hang out
looking for like cool new placemats even
though I'm 23 and alone but this place
seriously has everything like look at
the park like hello I'm sparkly
everything else and that's just one
aisle
look it goes on and on and on and on
forever
blankets kitchenware groomy whatever
that this is the selection is ripping
and so cheap it just makes my heart
flutter but the best part about this
place
I'm newer whoa hello this is my outfit
of the day by the way I look literally
so ridiculous but anyways most of all
these places are just full of a bunch of
things that I want but don't need but
also cameras spying like oh my gosh this
fluffy pillow is gorge and oh oh my god
I feel spiritually connected to this
trash can
I could honestly go on talking about
home goods for like 100 million years
but for now I will go ahead and take you
to our next stop next stop
see gallery the gallery is me if I was a
furniture store everything is luxe and
over-the-top and completely aesthetic II
so unfortunately for us all the really
nice stuff is really expensive
but what I like to get here is the
accessories this is where I get all my
fancy glittery placemats and other
super-fun unique accessories Oh mmm oh
my god hmm should I buy these yes this
store is truly just the absolute
definition of my favorite word I'm
setting but my favorite thing about this
store is the art look at it paintings of
shoes and perfume bottles and all things
going to add the spice of glam to your
home oh my gosh you guys look at this
piece of art it's an angel wing ma'am I
wish I had somewhere to put that in my
apartment from picture frames to lamps
the table decor this is basically what I
want my future life to look like gold
man goals to be honest my real advice is
if you can afford it buy everything here
but since I know me and the rest of the
world can't afford a $2,000 couch
definitely just stick to the accessories
but this place is a great place to find
some super cute stuff next on the list
good ol IKEA IKEA is basically the
forever21 of furniture shopping it's
huge totally overwhelming but best of
all it's cheap and full of treasures
it's basically just like a giant maze in
here but when it comes to home decor
you're not going to find anywhere
cheaper from chairs to couches to
everything in between
IKEA has the best prices on all the best
basics and just like a plain t-shirt
from forever the basics here are easy to
dress up to look million of fabulous
like a de Nicole lighting to the plain
black table and bug BAM dream kitchen
but the best of all think about IKEA is
the shelves I'm obsessive or shelving
units I own like a thousand of them like
I kids where I got all the beautiful
shelves for my favorite thing in my
house my shoe wall if you recognize that
it's also where I got my little mirror
that hangs above my bed and it's also
where I got my mirror for my vanity
mirror
I carried like a giant adventure but
well well worth it number three discount
stores discount stores are freaking
awesome and totally underrated Ross TJ
Maxx Marshalls all these places are the
bomb and full of little trinkets and
treasures
not to mention most of them are designer
at like half the OJ price I come to
stores like these to get all my little
trinkets and stuff like basically it's
just like a little Wonderland
so looks sparkly and glittery but
everything I never know I needed till I
saw it they are pretty good deals a
little mini furnitures like look at this
cool little whatever the heck this is 40
bucks amazing it is just so fun in here
oh my god I could literally frolic in
the aisles forever and last but not
least we're actually not going anywhere
online online is where it's at
Amazon and overstock are lifesavers when
I come to home decor because not only
can you Google literally exactly what
you're looking for it's delivered right
to your door and usually at a massive
discount like I got my bed on overstock
for three hundred dollars that's less
them like one chair at a fancy furniture
store online is a time and money saver
and what's better than that earning it a
spot at number five and wrapping up my
list would you look at that we're back
in my kitchen anyways they're having
bodies those are my top five picks I
hope you guys enjoyed the video and as
always if you have any more questions
comments concerns all my socials are at
NAMM Burchell oh look at that pom-poms
there ask a marshal so if you want to
hit me up on there feel free I love you
guys so very much happy decorating don't
forget to subscribe to the channel for
lots more fun shenanigans and I will see
you guys next time I love you kisses my
sweet baby angel XO
