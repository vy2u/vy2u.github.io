choker that I wore in one of my
instagrams on that I always get like
seventy bajillion questions about um

nice and not that expensive so there you

favorite I think I've ever had it

stuff on the site but literally fabulous

right so here we go I threw on that a
lacy crop top so you guys could see

bucks you guys so cute they're called
the canopy Jean the greatest Jean I've
ever worn in my life literally
and of course Lola Shoetique again

fashion OVA in action ok this is my
favorite one Lola Shoetique you guys
this place is where I get all of my
shoes it's why
I have so many because they have the
best quality shoes I have ever used ever
purchased
I will stay being a fan of this place
they just have the cutest shoes ever in
the world and are so incredibly cheap
like no lie I've seen the same shoes at
Steve Madden that they sell for like 200
bucks and here for 35 basically every
issue on the website is about 35 bucks
and they are awesome the only exceptions
the boots are a little more they're like
50 bucks I have these in literally all
of these colors actually but they have
again just the best so I'll show you a
few of my favorite Lola shoes because
they also have a lot of fabulous and
designer knockoff smiles which are the
best so check it out all right Lola Lola
Lola um so for things that came from
Lola Shoetique in my closet literally
every single pair of shoes that I own is
from Lola Shoetique with the exception
of those but no joke these these these
every single one is straight from their
so I'll show you a couple of them but as
you can see um let's see which ones are
gonna I'll show these quality is awesome
despite being cheap she lets get out of
focus there we go despite being cheap
shoes um they're so comfy so nice they
always come in cool styles and like I
said a lot of designer knockoff Styles
like these are a knockoff of Tom Ford
but so nice so cute and you would never
tell the difference between this and the
real thing literally all of my shoes are
from here all of them every single pair
I own all from Lola Shoetique and
honestly uh can you even blame me like
these were $22 unbelievable nothing
about up button soleil alright now if
you're really into budgets this place is
my favorite I get so much stuff this is
Aliexpress calm they have everything so
not even just clothes but of course that
is my personal favorite thing to get on
here because they have the best stuff
and it's all the stuff that you see in
the designer boutiques but its wholesale
price so you can get this floral dress
thing 21 bucks like one of the things
that I just got online the other day is
this I've wanted this for so long it is
the harness skirt it's like 70 bucks on
this random website and that's the
cheapest one I could find
usually like 120 and all these boutiques
but check it out on Aliexpress I just
copped it oh where to go oh here we go I
got it for 24 bucks and it is the exact
same quality literally the same so I
will show you a few things that I've
gone from Aliexpress to because this
place is honestly my favorite just type
in whatever you're looking for they have
a bunch of filters you can form them by
a size color location dress length oh
you can do all sorts of cool stuff I've
never even done that but yeah so you can
get literally anything you want on this
website and it's all super cheap it does
come straight from China but let me tell
you it's freaking awesome totally worth
the wait if you want to save the money
so here's a few things I've gotten from
here all right so some of the things
I've gotten from Aliexpress in the past
and this is one of my favorite purchases
of all time I will show you this in a
second on because it looks amazing it
looks really freaking weird sitting here
but I swear it's great um like I said
it's great for specific shopping like
black fringe skirt when you can't find
it anywhere else
Aliexpress is a great place to nab that
or a black corset belt I got this there
too super fun spotted that on Kim K and
wanted one and my little Arabic name
necklace um I got that on there too so
super fun super cheap uh I think this
was like I don't know all of it was
really inexpensive and fab so would
definitely recommend I'll show you this
one right now I'm so excited get ready
it's really extra anyways here we go
this is definitely like one of the
wildest looks in my closet um this is
from Aliexpress super funky uh I guess
you would call this faux sheep's wool
jacket I don't know what I even typed in
to find this but this was $9.99 so
stinkin cute so fun very extra um but
that's you know that's the way I like my
wardrobe and these suede leggings
actually are from there too you can see
the materials like woo kind of like
those weird couches you like as a kid
um but super fun $9.00 I think these
leggings were maybe eight dollars so
cute so fun fit amazing yes yes and of
course shoes courtesy of Lola Shoetique
again just these basic as
crappy guys I were in anklet every day
by the way if you guys are wondering
what that is um so super fun I think
these were $12 I got them on sale even
from the usual a cheap price so super
fun
like I said Aliexpress much better for
when you're searching for specific
things than just like generic shopping
but when you are looking for something
specific and fun it's a great website
alright last but not least misguided
this place is actually really popular
you've probably heard of this one before
but this is misguided calm I actually
came across this place by my fave a
Carli bybel um she's like a mutti beauty
guru here on YouTube and I freaking just
love her and she's where I've learned
how to do all my makeup but anyways um
she is the reason she did a
collaboration with them and that is how
I first found their website but since
then I ordered like 70,000 things from
here they have to die for clothes and
check it out 30% off everything that's
just random clicking today they have
such high-quality clothes and freaking
awesome stuff so let's see let's dresses
let's do short dresses just to show you
a couple of things here sorry my
computer is so slow lately again a lot
of like things that are copped from
celebrities you might recognize this
from Kim Kardashian but check this out
32 bucks for this dress unbelievable
this dress also 32 dollars it just super
cheap and super adorable like okay so
these are getting a little more
expensive but even still so damn cute
and the high quality here is great like
I got this dress I'll show you this on a
second I got this little rose gold dress
thing for like 30 dollars so I will show
you some of the things I've gotten from
misguided because this place is fab the
other cool thing about misguided check
it out 24/7 student discount so if you
have a student ID you can type that in
and you get 20% off everything so that
is fab I am still using my student
discount on here despite the fact that
I've been out of college for like a year
and a half don't tell them all right
here we go misguided um this is some of
the stuff that I got from the Carli
bybel collection unbelievable look how
nice and again you can see the quality
this jack is actually little more
expensive this was like Inc 60 bucks but
so nice so beautiful I got the little
matching dress that's super cute you
and I got a lot of mesh stuff from them
this is awesome it's totally see-through
actually but that's the style like
that's the point of it they a lot of
great jackets to this I got from there a
few years ago actually but it's awesome
it's like a crazy black a crazy black
fluff ball so definitely fun for nights
going out but yeah misguided has great
stuff so here's a couple of I'll support
these looks on for you all right here we
go some misguided for you as you can see
I really need to steam this because I
have not yet and it's wrinkly as hell
but still so cute you can see the
quality is so nice such a good fabric
and the fit is really cute too I wanted
it to be like oversized and kind of
baggy and it totally is so very cute
would definitely recommend again shoes
as always here they are Lola's so cute
you can see those um just stinking
adorable so there you have it misguided
so there you have it you guys those are
my top picks um if you get anything from
any of the stores a totally let me know
