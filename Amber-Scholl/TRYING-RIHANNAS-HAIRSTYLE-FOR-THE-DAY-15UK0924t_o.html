hair ready gashing it all the way up
into where you want to place your
ponytail make sure it's nice and
centered and it's on top of your head
like right there
all right in the center you got that
kid's setup hairspray and you want to
just keep on going and spraying quite a
bit because you don't want that ponytail
to go anywhere Rihanna has that sleek
how I want to be just like Rihanna this
is like a free eyebrow lift
who needs Botox when you have Josh look
at that Wow oh by the way Josh did a
full ponytail tutorial are my channel

like a really in-depth ponytail video

you want to see it but for now back to
this tutorial so you can see josh is
just wrapping around the hair band super
tight until it's all in place oh it's so
cute I love it okay so now we're gonna
go ahead and do the the curls right Josh
oh my gosh this is so fun oh so here we
go you can see we've got these certified
nume curling wand oh my goodness yes
look at that so how do you do it Josh so
all you do is you take a piece that your
hair and you're gonna want to just wrap
it around and let it go make sure you
hold it on just for a little bit it gets
really hot really quick so just be
careful and then you kind of let it out
and then it's a cute little cute little
girl oh this is so cute my bald spots
are like so on fleek today we're gonna
need to like fill those I'm not sure but
anyways look good good
looking like a big mood this is really
funny so a major shout out to new me for
partnered with me on this video um if
you guys want to get your own you could
go ahead and use this code for a mighty
fine discount so I can't win it with you
you can't win with me and we can all
twin with Rihanna together so you can
see the little curls are done so now
obviously my hair is a little too short
to do exactly like Rihanna's so
we are within out my weave so this is
like a little ponytail I got this on
Amazon for like 50 bucks you can see
it's specifically made for ponytails
it's even got the little wrap around the
concealer piece will show you how to use
that in the second so you can see the
emergency exits are to your left and all
you got to do is take your seat belt
wrap it around okay so now we're just
gonna go ahead and put in the big
extension chunk so what do we do Josh so
what you're gonna do is you're gonna
just Wiggly inside your little hair band
you can either put it at the base of
your hair or you can put it in between
what are we gonna do we are going to put
it at the base alright alright so now
that you got the base in we're gonna go
ahead and grab it grab the tail of it
and you're just gonna wrap it around I
am a professional hair assistant pray
that a lot wrap it around oh yeah oh yes
so there we go now we've got that thick
celeb hair with them my little baby
curls hiding underneath so now what are
we doing alright so what you're gonna do
is you're gonna grab small sections and
wrap it around your nume wand and what
you're gonna do is hold it on there just
for a little bit cuz you just want to
give it a little bit of sexy texture and
you're gonna unravel it and just kind of
let it hang family feel it's important
for this look that you leave the ends
out you don't want to curl the ends you
know just it's not necessary to give it
that nice beachy texture but so fun
it looks so shiny I actually kind of
look like a cocker spaniel
ooh we're starting to be Rihanna by the
way if you're new to the channel you
might not know this but Josh does have a
lot of credibility he may not have done
Rihanna before but he's done my faves
you've worked with who done you've done
Kim Ariana who else I've worked with
Lana I've worked with Miranda Kerr said
about her isn't she pregnant yeah so
yeah so like I said josh is legit well I
feel like I should have some added
content in here um can you tell me a
joke
damn what oh you're funny yeah so it's
all done and curl wow this is it's so
cute I love it okay so um so now it's
all curled go ahead and let it cool for
a second and what you're gonna want to
do is you gonna take a little
texturizing spray and you're gonna just
spray it all along the hair just to kind
of fluff it up and give it that extra
texture
I just got it directly my I'm sorry
we're gonna put a little bit of a yellow
right at the root area brush it down
nice and tight against the face it looks
like I have hair plugs it just looks
like it weird oh yes get it so it's
Rihanna approved special celebrity
protip Joshua color and my bald spots
for me using what is this eyeshadow no
it's essentially like an eyeshadow but
basically it's just a really dark
compact that you can just dust in the
spots that are extra balls
lightly dab it and just spread it around
oh yes
no more bald oh here's one quick little
trick if your hair is not thick enough
for whatever reason or your piece isn't
thick enough what you can do is you can
backcomb a little bit just to kind of
fluff it up and give it the illusion
that it's thicker than it actually is so
that way it's a little bit more full and
fluffy and fine hmm I've said a big
wizard like six hundred times in this
video but this really is a big amount
okay what do you think I think we're
good am I done
yeah I think we're all done all right
Rihanna
yeah oh my goodness oh yes work each
jump source Wow
