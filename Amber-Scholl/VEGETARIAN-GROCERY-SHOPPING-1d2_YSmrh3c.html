really have food top of mind right now
because guess what we're going food
shopping you guys are always asking me
what I eat in a day what my grocery
shopping routine looks like and what
kind of food I have in my house so I
thought why not take you guys on a
grocery shopping adventure by the way I
don't even think I said hey it's amber
so hey it's amber in case you're new hi
and if you're old you knew that so that
was unnecessary but you know what else
so today I'm going to take you guys
along for the ride on my grocery
shopping adventure and we're gonna go
buy some food because I'm freaking
starving so here we go without further
ado mhmmm don't know what I'm doing in
my hand here but whatever grocery
shopping our grocery shopping adventure
what could that be oh my goodness for me
hmm okay so I admit I staged that it's
actually arrived a few days ago but I am
still so excited to show you guys what's
in this box because it's shoes okay so
it's not shoes but it is food which
since I'm hungry is a very close second
you guys know I love love love online
shopping and you know shopping in
general so does it really come as a
surprise that I shop online perhaps my
groceries too no so I am so so excited
to be partnering with one of my favorite
online sites thrive market for this
video basically like this online
marketplace where you can buy literally
everything for like 25 to 50% off retail
prices and y'all know I love a sale so
well I love this place so before we get
going on our in-person shopping
adventure I thought I would show you
guys some of my favorite things that I
get it's a mail so it was actually
packaged like way nicer when I got this
but like I said I've actually been
eating all this for a few days but I
thought I'd show you some of the things
that I ordered Oh what should I start
with I don't even think I've mentioned
this yet but I have a vegetarian I've
been a vegetarian for about five years
so I didn't eat any meat at all no
chicken no meat no fish no nothing and
when I'm at home I'm a vegan and that
means no animal by-products either so no
butter no cheese no dairy no milk no
anything like that so all of the things
that I get on here are all vegan snacks
and things I also have the world's
biggest sweet tooth so basically all of
this is sweet and candy like like I've
got chocolatey protein
it's being vegetarian I'm always looking
for things that have protein in them so
good I've literally been eating them
like non-stop so anyways I have
chocolate of my teeth now probably but
what else got some coconut flakes these
are good to like sprinkle on little
oatmeal lid stuff oh and granola oh my
god I'm obsessed with granola Oh
and plantain chips which you can see
kind of look like real chips but also
look like bananas which sounds weird but
they're so good I literally like eat
them by the bagful video like I said I
love desserts so we got little macaroons
every stiffer insane of chocolate you
could ever imagine I'm allergic to
peanuts so I always get almond butter
this is Justin's honey almond butter
it's frickin bomb so I like to put that
on strawberries and stuff so organic M&amp;amp;M
lookin things so these are basically the
kind of snacks that I have in my house
all organic all healthy that's my
favorite kind of food the kind of food
that you can like pretend is healthy
like is it actually healthy to eat a
hundred mini almond butter cups probably
not but since the organic and vegan you
can tell yourself they are these he's
like some olives by the way oh so good
Frank markets also super cool because
when you buy a membership you're also
donating a membership to a low-income
family or a teacher or a veteran or a
student which is so cool it's like
shopping for a cause and what is better
than that it is literally the bomb.com
I guess well actually literally it's
thrive market calm but you get the voice
and if you guys want to try it they're
giving you guys a free 30-day trial plus
an additional 25% off your first order
so there's a link below if you want to
check it out you're welcome
by the way something else I order online
ironically enough this is not sponsored
I I just genuinely love these so much I
fill my entire fridge with them like a
psycho my friends always say that I have
a serial killer fridge because this is
like all that's in there but these
frickin drinks are like my favorite
thing in the whole world
I literally live off of them I have like
sometimes I drink like five of them a
day I'm gonna drink one right now
actually alright so now we're gonna go
on our in-person grocery shopping
adventure and of course before we get
going though uh there's our outfit of
the day
sports bra Enza matching pants provides
hoodie a little white cap super groovy
kicks and some crazy long
I just wanted to whip this back out for
this video for literally no reason at
all but wow this is literally ridiculous
but so fun so now here we go
I don't know I'm like a horse but not
okay before I say anything else weird
let's just go Sunday we're stopping off
at my favorite little place the farmers
market ha I ready so this is the
Brentwood farmer's market it is
literally the cutest place ever in the
world fresh vegetables
oh the fruits like look at how beautiful
office is so aesthetic and they always
have free samples
I don't know I love fries so these are
my friends hi guys
so these are just like fresh-baked vegan
desserts I am obsessed with them I
always get the brownie so we're gonna
get one of those okay
so many beautiful flowers - oh my
goodness
oh this is a beautiful photo I love
amber this is jasmine and she farm so
look at this thank you thank you so
there we go mean my eggs and we're gonna
see him yes we can - all right we are at
my favorite place in all of Los Angeles
Erewhon market so what is everyone you
ask basically it's like the world's most
expensive RC store but it is so fun I
figured since it was a special occasion
I take you here like look at all the
delicious things oh my god oh but the
only problem is literally look at that
$14 so uh needless to say Ashley don't
really buy much in here because it's so
expensive but you always see someone
famous like me and Jaden Smith are
practically friends because I see him
literally every time I come here they
have so much delicious prepared foods I
actually love the lentil soup so I'm
gonna get one of those Oh me and my
literal one item but all right where do
we go to the grocery stores that I
actually can chop it
all righty so here we go the local
grocery store that ayah fancy very much
something else I fancy very much when
hot boys walk by me when I'm filming
hello sir honestly still kind of
overpriced but it is really nice in here
so uh here's where I usually buy my real
groceries whoo I told you guys before
I'm literally obsessed with candies
specifically this brand so we're gonna
get some of these compare my fav hmm
what do I want today these are my
favorite and look at that they're on
sale today so can I buy a couple of
these I'm obsessed with avocados so I'm
gonna grab a couple of these what do I
want I don't know I'm tired I think this
is it oh my god they're trying to kill
me by six get one free but I'm trying to
be healthy so
all righty we got the goods and look at
this beautiful anyways there's already
like six billion roses in my house cuz I
can't stop buying flowers so the
lighting just got crazy what's up okay
there we go home and I'll show you mine
are you ready to see my grocery haul
here it is so here's what we got I guess
we'll start with the things I got at the
farmers market so I got the strawberries
and I got some cherries for delicious
vegan brownie thing these like organic
chickpea chips oh my gosh I like love
them so I got two of those kettle corn
because I get that up the world's
biggest sweet tooth so I couldn't resist
so delicious honey roasted almonds I
also got some of those at the store -
I'm like obsessed with these I literally
eat these like by the bucket they're
fantastic I got the one random container
of lentil soup and from the actual
grocery store we got some chips because
like I said love chips one avocado
because I hate when things go bad so I
usually just buy them like on the day
some almond milk we got some beans the
coconut ice cream oh my gosh YUM
more kettle corn like I said is actually
eating this in the car because I like it
so much so that's why it looks like that
the little gummy bears which I also ate
half the container on the way home guys
are always asking why I have so much
energy honestly it's probably because I
eat so much sugar but you know also just
the generic zest for life but the sugar
has probably got something to do with it
totally random side note did you guys
know Oreos are vegan yeah they are so
you could totally pretend those are
healthy I eat these literally all the
time
oh god flowers too because don't they
just make you happy when you look at
them oh so happy there we go
that's pretty much my loot you guys are
probably still confused too like I
didn't really buy any real food isn't
she gonna like starve to death how does
it yeah I probably would I usually get
out for like basically every meal but I
do eat snacks and stuff around the house
so that's what uh I get when I go
