friends since college so anything you
want to say um hi guys on it's so nice
to meet you all I look forward to seeing
more of you Selena
the mom of the group I've been debating
what I was gonna call this video for I'm
basically like 2 weeks I've been
deciding what I'm gonna do so I thought
I was gonna make me do DIY outfit I was
gonna do a Coachella vlog I was gonna do
a lookbook but none of them really like
spoke to me so just now we decided we're
gonna call it a DIY lookbook which is a
vlog lookbook the lighting just got so
weird I'm sorry so hang on one second oh
yes there we go much better so we're
gonna do a DIY lookbook which is a vlog
lookbook combined so I hope you enjoy
this new genre of video that I just
invented and we will see what this video
ends up being so instead of rambling
we're gonna go ahead and just get
started on this video here we go
Coachella DIY look look so before we get
started with this and get all the good
stuff which I promise there's a lot
let's get back to the beginning
oh so like I said Selena and Aletta are
my writer dies from day one of college
so it was so special we got to surprise
a letter with a ticket for her birthday
happy birthday Roy Boyd
she cried we cried it was a sappy mess
we love you weirdo huge shout out to see

you're welcome so we packed our bags and
headed out on the adventure where Selena
drove and I annoyed helento with 55,000
Instagram stories but eventually we got
to Palm Springs which is beautiful by
the way and we were ready to party and
so begins our lookbook
day one okay are you guys ready for
outfit number one if you even consider
this an outfit I'm practically naked but
okay here we go
bucho outfit new world oh no so
basically what we thought going on here
is a very luxurious sportswear having
like this fabulous cropped bra lets with
the matching shorts I know I know this
was a total total splurge but these for
my mood board is something I really
really wanted so fun hi go ahead the
hotel room is being cleaned while I do
this so you know my headscarf is
actually just a piece of fabric that I
bought downtown and tied around my head
I can see pretty nice literally I just
bought this fabric downtown for $2 and
wrapped it around my head easy quick DIY
super groovy my classic white retro
sunny is
the diamond for my Instagram the other
day there are fake diamonds of course
but they look real so who needs your
ones anyway matching ice on my hand my
Coachella
RIT fans and uh there we go water balls
I can't even believe these are the shoes
I'm wearing but I heard it's dusty in
there and any shoes you wear get ruined
so I'm borrowing these from paleta for
the day I'm warming up to them kind of
not really but you know okay I don't
know why I'm risking my life like this
but you know there we go that's it
numero uno ooh
Kayla can I do a trick okay anyways and
with this our day 1 adventure began this
was my first time in Coachella so I
didn't know what to expect but wow it
was so beautiful
oh so many things to look at Coachella
truly is a look all on its own Wow
beautiful
we have to see the weekend
so day one was a success which moves us
right along today - oh boy Oh is out
here in 2035 this is it you guys this is
everything we are all really something
else number two very similar to outfit
number one except more fabulous so here
we go we made a big mess of the bathroom
but anyways uh
mcdonough Zilla inspired Cumbre
thingamajigger
i literally am obsessed with this story
time really quick by the way and I first
bought this bra I wore it right out of
the store and literally in so many men
hit on me it was like unbelievable I've
never been hit on that much of my life I
swear was like a weird social experiment
I really don't even know so anyways
we're gonna test the theory again today
and I'll get back to you but honestly
ladies calm breath might be the vibe who
knows maybe that's the secret oh I just
thought we would really you know do the
most with this look and since these
shirts were so expensive I'm gonna wear
them again because whatever why not
vintage antique five Chanel and well
again with the jewelry more the merrier
I couldn't decide so I decided all of it
some plain kicks which my socks aren't
even I need to fix those but you know
you get the point in this that is day to
Coachella and the TV look kind of
believe me anorexia Barnes okay anyways
great cool - good job
everyone's in the background say hi
everyone we had a fashion show through
the garden oh yes
work it mama Bren didn't even get
started to fill my outfit again very
nice various accessorize let's see what
we got up here we got that nice boys are
so funny anyway all our favorite oh my
god this is literally insane look at all
these people and they're all young and
pretty hot to be honest like this one
she's hot so we're gonna go try and soon
my husband daddy post Malone
but unfortunately everyone else wanted
to see him too so we missed it I felt
like one of those weird little thingies
in spongebob but you know sweaty ER and
abettor shoes we didn't get to see my
post it's okay because we saw
his performance totally reinvented my
whole life queen bee is queen bee for a
reason and on that note we floated off
our Beyonce high and off into day three
first of all everything so extra right
now right anyways three I'm driving us
um I really have nothing to say we're so
tired we stayed up till like 4:00 in the
morning last night so what were we doing
just weeks ago so inappropriate we
actually just stayed up watching old
vine compilations so embarrassing I will
show you guys my outfit that when we get
outside but actually I've been something
uh you can so we're literally delirious
from exhaustion so much in fact that I
completely forgot to even film my outfit
number three oh I'll just do it in my
house really quickly but this was my
number OH trace believe it or not I was
gonna wear something much more
ridiculous than this but you know day
three I was getting tired so here we
have this look we have a plain black
lacy bodysuit with some Victoria's
Secret Show and over it to give it kind
of that bathing suit lacy jumpsuit
effect
bling-bling sunglasses book out to play
the hair in a braid I literally feel
like a horse with the sneakers which are
filthy oh my god they weren't lying
about the dirt look and fly as heck in
my foot design your hat easy fuck wit
that denim jacket for when it gets cold
at night and voila
that was Coachella look Dave totally
looks like underwear but you know what
it's good jelly you can wear whatever
you want
boom-boom-boom aside to forgetting to
film my outfit day three was a blast we
did stray field
climb through rainbow towers oh mama
cording and Paul climb we are officially
in love with you
overall Coachella was a dream with the
best of friends the fiery of looks and
the most incredible music which is truly
such a beautiful thing that it brings
people of all walks of life together to
share in the human experience music is
magic so with that I close out this
lookbook thanks for watching sweet
angels till next time Coachella until
next time my love's XO
we're good we were just making a bet in
the car Selena said that she thinks five
people will come up to me and say hi but
I think it's more than my contest how
many what do I win if I win okay so you
guys always say you want to see me go to
the grocery store my really extra outfit
so here we go
okay okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
