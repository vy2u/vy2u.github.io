back to my channel so today we are doing
something super exciting I am up bright
and early because a lot of you guys had
asked me to do a prom shopping themed
video but at 23 as much as I would love
to own another glittery sparkly dress I
just have no reason to buy a prom dress
or do anything wrong related though I
thought instead it would be fun to take
a lucky one of you guys on a shopping
spree with me to go ahead and buy her a
prom dress
so today that's what I'm going to go do
I'm literally going to go meet them for
brunch in like five minutes and then
we're going to go shopping downtown it
has like a quick little Cinderella story
so I am so excited
um yeah without further ado a shopping
spree prompt blah blah blah blah but um
don't worry I'm not missing the whole
video here we go
really quick of course before we get
going I just want to say a huge thank
you to audible for agreeing to sponsor
the shopping free today I couldn't do it
without you so thank you so much and in
order to say a proper thank you very
much so I'm going to go ahead and do
what I do best a quick little glittering
DIY so I'm going to go ahead and
bedazzle some headphones for you because
audible is basically a digital library
of everything you ever wanted too lazy
to read audible reads for you haha
I'm kidding but also seriously it will
book podcast and everything in between
your fave celebs will literally read
bedtime stories few like Eddie retin-a
will redo JK Rowling fantastic piece or
if you really viewed seventeen hours of
the unabridged version of Fifty Shades
of Grey in German you can listen while
you glue tough stuff in the car on a
plane on the train okay I'm no dr. Seuss
but you know just think you get the
point
if you want to sign up for a 30 day free
trial and a free book at audible.com
flash amber shoal the link is in the
description sample for any reason you
get to keep the book for free so you and
I can both wait for them to upload a
track of Harry Styles voice on loop for
30 years to get there and on that note
