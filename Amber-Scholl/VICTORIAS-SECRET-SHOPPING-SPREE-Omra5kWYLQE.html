a beautiful angel pies it's amber
welcome back to my channel and today we
are going shopping I know I know we've
been shopping a lot lately but in my
defense we were actually not gonna do
that today we were going to go to the
grocery store but uh I check the mail
before I left and I found these puppies
so instead we're going to Victoria's
Secret yes my videos aren't to spur the
moment I don't really plan them in
advance but you know what it keeps life
interesting so any rusie without further
ado here we go
a very Victoria's Secret shopping
extravaganza ready oh wait before we get
going here's our outfit of the day which
if you've never seen my videos before I
usually wear very cool outfits but um
today honestly I was just not moving I
was feeling very lazy so we are in a
giant oversized sweatshirt so this is
just like a men's oversized champion
hoodie I can see the little logo right
there we got some crazy raw chicken feet
why not rings for day is to spice it up
some sunny zenbu do I look literally
ridiculous yes I do but you know what
it's fine life is short I wanted to wear
this so onward huh woo kela ooh a true
test
this one I'm feeling lazy today
all right here we go the mother Lord and
Oh
more sales yes let's see what we can
find in here so like I said I'm just
like it's super pumped I don't know what
I'm even looking for but just anything
that touches my hmm
what does this say Oh angel Karan
filters I'm not one of those but this is
beautiful oh my gosh look at these
colors oh my god and mrs. elephant thing
oh and in my size hello it wasn't meant
to be
grab ourselves a bag here I think we're
gonna be needing it literally with
chopping gear for 500 civilian years and
it amazes me they still have new styles
like how many bras can you possibly
designed and yet every time I'm in here
something new so you're killing it
you're killing it you who is not even a
real person is killing it everybody
killing just I guess what I love you
guys at home you're killing it too I
don't care if you're sitting in bed with
no makeup eating hot cheetos you still
killing it girl
I still kill it what oh my god I
literally picked the best day ever to
come here Wow
they're like long-lost brothers oh
actually no mine's better my gosh this
is so cute honestly I would wear this is
a regular shirt I wonder if I sell it
well this is a weird thing to film on a
background hold on and be funny I used
to come in here with my mom when I was a
kid and I thought it was the most boring
place in the world and now I like to
kick it up so what like an angel
how about sweet like an angel that's you
guys okay not it's like a really bad pun
but anyways back to shopping so we're
gonna try and be practical to get bras I
can actually wear
oh my god I'm obsessed with those
high-waisted ones do they have this
anywhere
let me tell ya I wasn't so see
caller ID so I'm usually a small bomb I
mean here we go let's see if oh and they
have them in the white - Wow
okay we're just gonna have a bunch of
you actually well not this money how
about these two
okay great
all right let's see what the cosmedix
has to offer ooh and they're so
aesthetically pleasing Wow Wow I love
them
oh this whole stores on sale I remember
correctly my favorite one was called
pure seduction I don't know all right
anyways I'm so easily distracted back to
bras ooh I forgot they also have this
whole back room but honestly I don't
know these kind of like for me a little
bit like where's the zest like why not
weird some crazy glittery nonsense under
your clothes you might as well have fun
whoa how could I forget about this whole
section of the store ooh
they have so much cool stuff oh well
hello it's actually cute we're gonna
wear this
at Arab underwear this looks like some
weird cheerleading thing I don't know
okay anyways whoo she looks cute I want
that what is that I'm literally looking
at it yep I gotta try this I really need
to work on this all righty here we go
whoo thank you my love already guys
let's do this
whoo all righty so we got quite the loop
here we got all the underwear all of the
bras oh my gosh these are so beautiful
I'm so excited and we got these little
sets so these will be fun though well
let's get going I don't really know how
I'm gonna do this but uh let's see what
I come up with all right here is the bra
you can see that you can't see it
because I am shy just kidding I'm
totally oh my god I am losing it this is
so cute oh my god the matching underwear
oh and the high-waisted oh my god
I love it this one you can see is
basically the exact same set in white oh
so cute I love this one too
this jacket actually ended up being like
the perfect thing to wear in this video
cuz I can like you know cover up in my
bra video so so silly all right now that
we did that here we go let's try on
these puppies oh ho ho look at that kind
of funky we got like the little gray
jacket with the bottoms which are very
sparkly this is actually that same bra
but this is like in a nude and black
lace which I'm actually super into I'm
loving it
speaking of picking out you can see the
high-waisted underwear that match very
fun cool secret Victoria's Secret this
is super cool the only thing that I
don't like about it is the outside is
really soft but the inside isn't made of
that same soft stuff so it's a bummer
now this is comfortable kind of plain
and basic for 50 bucks but I guess
aren't that coupon so watch to see how
much this brings up to booting on sleep
that's actually just an Instagram trick
look at this see normal profile but if
you pop your hip bad extra you look like
you got a Kardashian booty
you also got some like stomach rolls but
you know who cares we all have them
whatever whoo this one is kind of fun
honestly kind of looks like something
girls in la would spell out but um no no
it's okay I've even got my Victoria's
Secret Angel hair ooh
killing it well he's actually really
nice you ready to go to the gym who won
okay that's funny
well these are a look really soft very
big I don't know I don't know Wilkins
that's a wrap on that oh guys look at
the force look at our coupon so let's
see what we can do oh you guys I gotta
stop doing this staying places until it
closes right at least it's pretty though
ooh this is such a move okay anyways you
ready to see what I got tah-dah all
right well first things first because
you already saw it on my head they gave
me a free hat with purchase that was
pretty cool um I also ended up getting
that pink fuzzy outfit because I just
need fuzzy things anyways there we go
now I can be soft and fuzzy
what else did I get oh yeah a t-shirt
sparkle I just thought this was so fun I
love oversized tees so I got that oh wow
this shirt anthems little pink set are
actually business purchases
um this shirt and the little Pink's that
are actually business purchases because
they're going to be used for a new
lookbook coming soon so stay tuned for
that and of course Wow a hundred
thousand bras so maybe not a hundred
million but I did get three I got one of
each color well I guess I'm really not
that exciting when it comes to brown I
just like darker colors so we got the
black what the white one the blackish
nude one with of course all the matching
underwear
voila voila and voila I'm obsessed with
these high-waisted ones
fan-freakin'-tastic sir so all that
aside I feel like I also got oh yeah I
got a free pair of underwear with one of
my coupons so that's cool and since
these were so severely on sale got three
because it was literally one for
eighteen or three for twenty so I
figured I'd splurge and do a giveaway
listen to these puppies and a nice
little card from me
just follow my Twitter and retweet this
and you're entered to win oh I really
did get a lot of stuff today this
actually never happens and with all my
coupons I ended up getting a banger deal
on all this stuff I think I saved like
over two hundred fifty bucks - so very
cool very cool so there have you guys
that is probably the most successful
Victoria's Secret shopping trip I will
ever go on ever in my life usually when
I go there I buy nothing I hope you guys
