back to my channel I know it's finally
October so I can finally say that my
pretty pumpkins hi guys
by the way no I didn't get a haircut I
just honestly thought it'd be fun to
have short hair today so we're rocking a
wig but anywho Z um so today we're going
to go on a vintage clothes shopping
adventure because honestly I just really
wanted to go so we're gonna go Ellie
just has so many cool places for that
sort of thing on if you've never seen my
videos before usually I would talk for a
few more seconds about like whatever
adventure we're going on for the day but
to be honest I'm just too excited to get
going so we're just gonna head out so
without further ado here we go you me my
weave of the day and a very vintage
shopping extravaganza so as always
before we get going here is our outfit
of the day we got a really thin black
strappy bodysuit paired that with some
denim booty shorts which to be honest
are way too small
XM and we put them in the dryer so we're
gonna get some new shorts today and
since we're gonna be doing a ton of
walking I went ahead and put on some
sneakers which is so out of character
for me but these are really cute so and
to pull it all together today is outfit
of the day is actually sponsored by a
super cute company called dad hats
we're totally channeling our inner
Kourtney Kardashian with this one
because she was wearing a hat very
similar look at that oh yes twins so if
you want to twin with me and Courtney
Kay the package of three they sent me is
$42 but they're still the cheapest dad
hats on the web at $23 a hat all the
orders are shipped and delivered within
one to three days so everything will be
at your service right away plus they're
having 30 percent off sale right now so
coud boga 30 we'll give you a a pretty
penny discount you can get the hats on
the dad hat website but you can also get
them on the wish shopping app which

hair what is this I think I was born in
the wrong decade so cute

to take you guys on a bonus adventure to
one of the coolest little vintage stores
around okay first of all how beautiful
is Rodeo Drive and second of all here's
where we go in this is called what goes
around comes around and it's literally
the coolest place ever check it out move

vintage Chanel in the world yeah

is all vintage Chanel stuff and check it
out this is not the only stuff like is
this not a look how about this big mood

designer resale boutique but this one is
a little more affordable goals man

record there anyways they said it was
also from the 80s so I was like ooh babe
