back to my channel and today we have a
special guest in my house since you
missed him so dearly this creepy
mannequin head no I'm kidding
my beautiful good friend josh is back in
the crib before the actually this is the
first time he's ever been here but hey
John oh this is brand new it's freaking
amazing thank you thank you thank you so
so I know speaking of amazing look at
Josh's outfit oh my god
outfit of the day on frickin fleek I
love it mmm almost as cool as her outfit
who is bald face Baldy is sporting a
wild look okay anyways you guys remember
Josh from that first video I did
celebrity hairstylist does my hair he's
a celebrity hair stylist extraordinaire
has done all sorts of clothes labs so I
decided to be so fun to recreate one of
Kim's most iconic looks this one right
here
oh my gosh like I was just living for
the long looks amazing so today we're
gonna go ahead and recreate Kim's look
with the help of my darling josh Josh
you want to say anything else before we
start you're gonna be shot wearing Kim
Kardashian's hair for the day all right
so we've got the goods first of all we
got Josh who is a great good a great
good if fabulous asset to my life and
then we've also got all of the fancy
goodies we're going to be using oh my
goodness look at all of this stuff and
of course for flat ironing our hair
we've got the beautiful foxy Bay if we
had brand-new in-the-box I'm so excited
nice rose oh my gosh these are beautiful
I mean you can adjust the temperature
with these plus and minus signs and an
on and off button
hmm so um without further ado let's
start
whoa but first are you ready to see the
wild hair we're gonna put my hair Johnny
sure
oh my god so excited oh god oh god oh oh
my god oh it's so much what wow oh yes
hunty work it wow this is gonna be a
mood and a half look at the length of
this oh so aggressive oh so funny so
Josh what are we doing first alright so
what first everything starts with a good
blow dryer well let's do that then I
know yes my hair is already dry but josh
says we need to blow-dry it anyway so
how do you have to blow-dry some product
into it just so that way it stays nice
and like completely fleek oh so they
read that Kim Xin you know the way
nothing this is like a weird head
massage oh yes mmm thank you okay so now
we got to get the perfect middle part is
it perfect I don't know take a look from
the frack okay yes I know this is what
I'm seeing right now oh yes the artist
at work oh yes what a vibe so we've got
some my perfect middle part now Thank
You Josh and we're going to start to
flood by on it a thin section okay and
we're just gonna go in start at the root
you just really oh my goodness look at
how sleek this is Oh what amazing like I
said this is like a salon defense the
iron so what did you say Josh you can
like not just straighten it you can do
other things you can do anything with
this iron I mean it's like a high
quality iron so you can do like waves
you can do curls with this you can kind
of do whatever you want
so I mean the world is your oyster the
flat iron I don't know it's someone
someone so that on a pillow for me
temperature did we set this to yet what
do you say 360 360 so like it's
temperature controlled so you can
totally set it towards your hair type
amber has a little bit finer hair
so I mean if your hair is steaming when
you put the iron on it that's not like
obviously thicker hair higher
temperature thinner hair lower
temperature you know it's not rocket
science folks by the way if you want to
twin with me and Josh on the cool iron
the wonderful folks over at Fox eBay
agreed to partner with me on this video
so they're giving you $100 off coupon
with code amber so supercooled if you
want to save a couple more bucks they
also have a Bangor holiday bundle too so
merry christmas happy hanukkah kwanzaa
kheh I forget how much saying goes but
what is it happy Christmas Hanukkah
Kwanzaa go is that it something like
that happy holidays okay what so before
we flutter and rest of my hair we're
going to Flatiron baldies hair who we
are putting the hair on right now this
is so funny
so explain what's going on here so
basically any time you get like a bundle
of hair it's gonna kind of be a little
wavy so you want to always prep the hair
ahead of time and you want to go ahead
and shoot it with a little bit of shine
spray to make it nice and glossy to give
it that nice blue and then you want to
go in with your foxy bay flatiron
just go ahead and really make it like
perfectly straight okay and you can do
that by using a comb and then just
following it with your flat iron soft it
looks sidenote this kind of hair costs
literally what a Josh Sippy what do you
think like I mean it can go up to like
thousands of dollars for a full hat oh
my god too much by the way Josh has some
baller street cred he doesn't like to
brag but um he just got off to her with
freaking ariana grande he's worked with
Kim before who else you've done all
sorts of cool people I've worked with
I'm like Lana Del Rey music videos
so yeah so he's he's legit just you know
in case you were wondering so here we go
what's happening Josh so we just bought
her first whoo
oh wow beautiful okay so the key to
doing this and making it flat and like
beautiful and super sleek you basically
have to glue it track-by-track all along
their hair on every single layer of
their hair poor Baldy we robbed her over
here again but okay so we're just gonna
cut it into place
snip a snip so it's kind of a tedious
process and it's gonna take a minute
sorry I'm burn oh well good thing I have
no life and nothing else to do well
perfect so here we are so basically
we're gonna use just like regular hair
bond weave glue so just to show you it's
like not gonna damage your hair cuz
literally it's just like sticky tacky
stuff weird alrighty we are gluing hair
onto my hair now I'm gonna be gluing in
the extensions so you have to be very
tedious with this like you can't be like
messy otherwise you're gonna ruin the
person's hair did not tell me any of
this before yeah
I swear Josh of all of my hair falls out
after this I will be so angry don't
worry the only hair falling out after
this will be this hair I'm trusting you
Josh I trust my hair I'm gonna be so sad
okay here we go
moment of truth alright going in it's
gonna go on okay guys so now I already
cut and measured it to her head so what
we're gonna do is we're gonna apply glue
on this side let it dry and get a little
bit tacky it's kind of just like eyelash
glue you want to just let it cool real
quick and then you want to go ahead and
apply it on the hair line that you
sectioned off nice and neat again you
should leave about a thumb from the
hairline so you want to just go ahead
and put it right there and then you're
gonna grab your blow-dryer
and blow dryer on the staff on your
you don't want to burn your head don't
do it hot
whoo and there we go so we just did the
first layer and it's super long and
super stringy but that's why you just
keep layering it's crazy
a one wet down how many more to go like
300 probably like realistically like 50
oh my god like maybe not well we'll just
you know camp out in my house my gosh
you guys we're almost done
he's just finishing up you have like two
more yeah yeah all right then we're
gonna be done I'll show you the finished
product
okay you guys you're almost done we're
just um what do you what are you doing
right now just gonna put a little bit of
shine spray and you just go ahead and
spray that pretty liberally put a little
bit of shine red and rush through and
it'll literally make it looks extremely
glossy and super like healthy and like
real and like just fantastic beautiful
oh my god I love this so much
oh you want to go ahead and get rid of
any of these flyaways cuz Kim would not
approve what you're gonna spray a brush
with a little bit of firm holding
hairspray and just go ahead and glide it
right along the hairline Wow oh my
goodness
seventeen million hours later the Sun
fell out the Sun is still out it's
amazing oh okay are you guys ready to
