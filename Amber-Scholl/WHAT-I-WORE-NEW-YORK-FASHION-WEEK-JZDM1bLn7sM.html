rest of the morning ended up being a
literal disaster I just had to throw
things in my bag super quick cuz I
wasn't prepared but eventually I did get
on the plane and it was a beautiful view
I've barely filmed anything on my camera
because I'll explain here via my
instance story we had to buy another
play to get on this one in like five
minutes
yeah so me Bailey and Jez in the seat in
front of us I watched you know Crazy
Stupid Love lusted after Ryan Gosling it
was a great flight eventually we got
there you can see the city and the taxi
but I didn't see that shot it to Bailey
for filming because I fell asleep but
once we got there I woke up and looked
out the window and Wow

itinerary is going to a fashion show so
