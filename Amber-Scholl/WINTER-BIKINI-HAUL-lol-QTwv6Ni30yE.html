serious they watch vod's up in here
today so today we're gonna be doing my
first ever clothing haul so apologies if
I don't really know what I'm doing
and yes by the way I know it's super
weird to do like a swimsuit haul in the
middle of the winter time but uh the
cheapest time to buy swimsuits is the
middle of the winter so of course
naturally that's when I'm gonna do it oh
here we go
swimsuit haul Christmas season style oh
ho ho alright guys so I got every single
swimsuit that I wore today I went on
like a massive shopping spree this
weekend on a website called saffle which
I'd actually never heard of before but I
just discovered it and it is
unbelievable like look at the prices on
these things you guys $12 $13 $12 like
huh I've never seen a swimsuit that
cheap in my life so I just went crazy
and bought like a bajillion of them like
no joke I think I got 15 so I'm suits
for like $100 and they have like a
billion coupons in addition to that
anyways let's get started on the whole
oh yeah I'm here to save you not really
cuz I can barely swim but okay oh I
don't really know what you're supposed
to do when I try on ho but I guess I'll
just try them on for you um it's I
cannot oh my god my tan line is so bad
this is embarrassing but whatever okay
so um this is the first little swimsuit
that I got I think this one was like 20
dollars maybe max is so cute and I know
this is like a lot of booty for you too
but I want to show you the back look at
this it's so cute got like the little
crisscross how can I show this better
there you go you can see kind of a
little better to like crisscross the
action super fun so yeah there we go
that is a swimsuit swimsuit number one
good ah swimsuit number two I'm being so
extra today but not like I'm not always
extra but anyways I'll see the sounds
kind of fun it's like mushy detailing
whatever again I think this one was like
17 dollars I'll check and confirm that
but links to all them in the description
but anyways um yeah it's like geometric
II kind of cool this one has a lot more
booty coverage so that's cool um yeah
super fun I'm into it and the best thing
about swimsuits like this is that they
can double as regular clothes
like look at this tell me you would know
this is a one-piece swimsuit from the
beach strike two
party whoo this was fun um definitely
would recommend getting a bigger size
though because this is way too small on
me yikes I think I got a small so I
would definitely get a bigger size um
but this one's cool I thought it had
like super DZ vibe just like the white
and nude which is why I got it I thought
it was cool but again yeah definitely
get a bigger size because cool swimsuit
aside of the fact that my boobs are
going to literally fall out of it so
that's actually really fun I wasn't sure
if I was gonna like this one but it's
cool Tyga looks like a bikini but it
isn't a bikini which is kind of fun it's
like got this mesh shenanigans you can
see it like is a bikini but it's not
what so it's like sneak attack see the
back to open it totally stole the tag on
it but you would see it's like a little
more full coverage cute cute there we go
Jenna mm-hmm a glide II Angelique
goddess mmm
Bato Wow this is a look if I have a saw
one okay so I'm just gonna show you the
swimsuit I have on underneath this but
uh it's a lot um little much even for me
who likes to be a lot so yeah you can
see one pieces cannot definitely still
be revealing yikes what even I don't
know whatever it's just you guys but
yeah here we go you can see it's a yeah
okay so we're just gonna keep the cover
but for now actually look at some really
cute cover-up things like this is so fun
you can see this is like really pretty
um I actually wear this out to like
these duster kimono things are another
thing that can double as like a regular
outfit like look at this I wore it the
other day and this like little get up
and it looks bangin um anyways next time
suit all right here we go bikini season
not really cuz I does December but um
yeah this is like a string bikini
looking thing which I don't usually love
but I thought this one was kind of cool
with like the black hair looking stuff
so I guess in hindsight this kind of
isn't that cute but you can see it's
some kind of like funky mesh stuff which
looks cooler in real life than it does
on camera but um yeah wait for the story
focus so yeah there you go
basic anybody black bikini she will
it's a bets a teeny-weeny black black
black bikini okay that song sucked
alright so here's another one on this
one is way too small I got an extra
large on this and it's still really
teeny so I'm just gonna keep my hand
here but um it's a cute swimsuit
nonetheless I got it because Kim had one
that was super similar that I saw her
wearing on the beach with st. so I
thought it would be fun um like the
bottoms are actually totally cute you
can see they have like the little
braided shenanigans and then this is
like a really cool pattern but um yeah
it doesn't really fit me that great but
if you have a smaller chest I think this
would be a totally cute swimsuit just
not really I'm not really for me that's
my favorite water tried on so far I
think because it actually fits my chest
it's a miracle you guys it that's me
head friends and friends whoosh so I
also got this really cool like kimono
thing oh my god this is like the funnest
ever it's like very billowy and insane
so you feel like an evil Loch Ness
monster
woman but super fun it looks cool with
the swimsuit actually and but you can
see this swimsuit is actually really
cute um it's like what do you would call
this fringy action I guess so here you
can see cha-cha-cha cha-cha-cha
cha-cha-cha cha-cha-cha yeah this is
like a really cool look this is another
one of those things that I would say you
can totally wear out of the house like
it's up in the club um not with a
swimsuit obviously but super cute also
yeah definitely would recommend this
luxurious robic thingamajigger bobber I
need to practice how to be sexy okay I'm
gonna like this one look at how cute
this is it's like kind of like a bikini
but it's a little more conservative like
look how cute it comes with a little
bikini underneath thing but it's like a
little skirt thing so fun great for
summer barbecue going at the bay's house
laying poolside in Vegas filming your
Harvard Law acceptance video now I'm
just kidding
but I thought this was very like Elle
Woods Elle Woods esque yeah I got into
Harvard Law what like it's hard
