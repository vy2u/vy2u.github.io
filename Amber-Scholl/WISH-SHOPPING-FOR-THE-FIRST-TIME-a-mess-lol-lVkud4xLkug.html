what's up it's amber welcome back to my
channel it is actually so early right
now look at this like look at that the
Sun isn't even barely out yet but so
funny I'm so used to whispering not to
wake up my roommates but I'm alone now
I'm afraid my new pad but anyways so
today Gus what we're doing you already
know because it was the title of the
video but you guys have been begging me
to do a wish haul which honestly I'd
never heard of before until I started
watching a bunch of the videos on
YouTube so basically it's just like a
app with a really cheap stuff so I
thought I would order some of it and
show you guys what I got um and review
it so but without further ado here we go
a very extra and malicious wish hall I
don't know what amber licious is but
it's what this hall is going to be
all right so we're doing a little bit of
makeshift filming today I don't have it
run yet so we're gonna film on this nice
pink fuzzy blanket that I bought at EJ
match the other day so are you ready for
the whole let's just get into it
I thought I would start out I got a
bunch of things I got clothes shoes but
I guess we'll start out with what I'm
wearing all right that's the end of the
hall thanks for watching non kidding
okay so this thing so this is just a fun
pink fuzzy sweater top thing matches my
lipstick so I loved it
I think it was like $3 but um the only
problem is I was supposed to be a dress
and well it is absolutely not long
enough to be a true I might have worn
this as a dress in high school but uh
nope not anymore too old for this so
voila these looks so boring the swish
hull isn't gonna be super boring I mean
maybe it is I don't know I'm gonna try
to make it interesting though so these
are just some generic leggings I got but
oh look at the inside it's like made of
fuzziness or so I'll try them on for you
just to show ya oh it's like a hat
alright it's too early clearly oh yes
what a fluttering look so you can see
these are the pants my only real chrome
with them is this you can see they've a
really weird like man crotch thing I
really don't know what's going on here
and it's kind of hard to see but trust
me it looks really weird so maybe if you
cover it with the sweater it'll be fine
so to be honest I wouldn't really
recommend those or the sweater but uh
we'll move on to something funner all
right since we're not having too much
luck with clothes we're gonna go ahead
and move on to my favorite thing Julie
you guys know I love love love love
rings a bunch of you guys that wish was
a great place to get them so I went
ahead and ordered three rings so here's
my thoughts so there you go you can see
the Rings come in little containers like
this um in a little baggie and these
were the rings that I got this was the
first one so before I review this let me
just show you what I purchased this is
the ring that I ordered look at that all
is so sparkly and beautiful this is the
ring that I got this is the ring that I
got it literally is made of plastic you
it has absolutely no Sparkle whatsoever
um yeah so a big disappointment there
not to mention the rest of the Rings
didn't really have up to their
expectations either I also got this one
which you can see is slightly more shiny
but also definitely still plastic you
can see there one of the stones came
like pre falling out so that's great
meanwhile those two totally sucked I
actually did get one that was awesome
look at this one well let me show you
this at a better angle I got this one
and this one is beautiful I don't know
why it's sort of out of focus but oh my
gosh you can see this one is made of
real crystals actually sparkles and
light is beautiful I wear it all the
time I actually really love this one so
honestly overall I guess it's kind of a
hit or miss I got to that sucked one
that rock however the one that was
awesome was also expensive it was like
$30 and the other two were like two
dollars and you knit the same ring on
Amazon for less so not to mention they
both turned my finger green within like
five minutes of wearing them so
definitely would not recommend buying
rings on here it's a no from me sorry
guys you're not going to Hollywood all
right so I guess we'll move back to
close for a second look at this oh how
could I resist so this is actually a
skirt that I got I can see the picture I
thought it was gonna be kind of fun so
let's check it out the chicken Express
coming through oh I don't know where I'm
gonna put both of the mirrors so they're
just together now so whew it's like
stepping into the twilight zone
not really okay anyways so chicken skirt
yes it's definitely feathery and that's
about it again it's really short um kind
of fun maybe if you paired it with
something else funny we already have a
jacket that matches this perfectly now
that is a big mood abominable snow
chicken at Sheila's by the way I always
get questions where I got this jacket I
too got this in London for like 20 bucks
on the side of the street however you
can also find it on Amazon and eBay
however you can also find it on wish
technical jacket so this one on the good
always
so I went ahead and picked that up you
can see it's the same thing except it's
maroon so I'll show you that guy alright
now we can see it's super fuzzy and soft
and a great color - it was still fun to
match maroon lips to the jacket but of
course I'm not doing that today but uh
it is actually such a cute jacket and I
think I got this one for us steel at
like eighteen dollars but it also took
over a month to come so personally I
would buy them on Amazon for a couple
dollars more to get them right away but
you know it's up to you I actually
really like this and worn in quite a few
instagrams solid jacket solid jacket so
while we're in the mood of being fluffy
royalty how about this a crown to add to
the magic I love crowns I read them all
the time in videos so I thought it would
be fun to get another one this one was
just a really unique spin on one it's
kind of made of like golden wire with
pearls on it and it actually looks
pretty chill in real life too like it
would make a nice decoration like
sitting on something but uh the only
problem is when you actually put it on
your head it's huge but it really
doesn't fit at all I don't know what
kind of person's head this was made for
cuz I have a really big head and this
thing is like 70 sizes too big I bent it
and all sorts of stuff but it just uh
does not work so that was a
disappointment but I guess I can still
use it as home to course something I
don't know come up with something to do
with it
let's see what else do I got here oh yes
well since I'm sweating to death in this
outfit anyway we'll go ahead and switch
gears here we'll try this nice little
white version of the sweater
well don't read it actually it's kind of
cute alright so now you can see um comes
up a little weird in the front but I
guess that's what you get for like a
five dot what is this hmm
foes trying to ruin my video okay
anyways you can see it's actually kind
of a cute shirt I'm definitely really
thin you can almost see my brother again
okay um so you can see you can kind of
see my bra through it honestly I think
this was like a dollar so I would say
that was worth the price on that one
it's kind of cute kind of fun totally
see it being cute with jeans or
something actually liked it so I'll wear
this for the rest of the bin and to pair
with our new fuzzy sweater I went ahead
and got this funky skirt I've always
wanted a fringy skirt this looks like
something out of a horror movie but
we're gonna try it on we're gonna try it
on
whey shake shake that ass for me okay I
don't think I could say ass anyway so uh
here's this you can see this is just a
crazy fringy skirt um definitely got a
lot of layers you can tell it's chief by
the waistband you'd have to cover that
if you were really gonna wear it but I
think if you were like a long blazer
over it it could be kind of fun so
actually it's very fun and of course no
look would be complete without shoes so
these were the shoes that I ordered I
know doesn't look like something I'd
order right but uh this was the picture
they looked a little cuter than this all
right tada
so I know it's sorry my legs are like
albino I haven't containing lotion on
them and forever though just go with it
but uh yeah these are the shoes
absolutely nothing I'm wearing today
goes together at all but you know you
can kind of see the shoes and actually
not particularly cute but you know what
I gotta say they are very comfortable
and fit well so I'm not my favorite but
you know they are kind of growing on me
whoo so uh there we go
I think that isn't very hall well I'm um
I think that was the completion of my
wish hall I honestly thought I got a lot
more stuff but I guess I didn't so um
honestly I think the general consensus
is I am NOT a wish girl I do not like it
very much mostly because I didn't really
get anything that I really liked the
sight of the red jacket and the one ring
which are also the two most expensive
things that I bought so all in all I
just feel like the pictures were really
misleading and even though the prices
were low the quality was really low twos
and not to mention the shipping amped up
the prices of everything I had to pay
not one like lump shipping fee for all
of this every individual thing that I
bought I had to pay like ten dollars in
shipping because it was all coming from
I think China don't quote me on that so
it really just uh was not my favorite
website I've ever shopped on plus from
the day that I ordered it everything
didn't arrive until like almost a month
and a half later so uh yeah not my face
but as a true ho for a bargain um I
couldn't resist trying it out I just
think all in all I just personally
prefer other sites think of
but that is my personal opinion so go
ahead shop til you drop to wherever your
heart so pleases yeah but no thank you
guys so much for watching I love you so
so so so much
the Sun is definitely rising now I think
it's like at least 7:30 so I'm gonna go
eat some breakfast good I'm hungry and
uh do whatever else it is what I'm gonna
do today so I love you guys don't forget
to subscribe to the channel if you're
lots more fun nonsense and I will see
you guys next time
I love ya kisses my beautiful sweet
gorgeous happy early bird babies I was
really dramatic but whatever
no no no no no no no bird it's a plane
it's the wish Queen wearing everything
she bought at once oh yes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
