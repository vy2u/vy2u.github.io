the Academy Awards
okay well it's not really but hey a girl
can dream right as a broadcast
journalism student here at Pepperdine
University I dream every day of being a
reporter on the red carpet but why
should you choose me to host the red
carpet at the Oscars this year well
there are the obvious reasons I'm smart
I'm talented I'm beautiful but the real
reason that you should choose me is
because I will do absolutely anything to
get there anything I get fun life
tattooed on my fingers I just forget to
wear underwear one day I get pregnant so
I could have my own hit television show
better yet I'll say Justin Bieber
fathered my baby hello I'd get married
to an NBA superstar then get a divorce
in 72 days and revel in all of my money
oh yeah
bear meat dress so who are you wearing
Oscar Mayer storm into a hair salon and
shave my head and even ruin Taylor
Swift's speech excuse me imma let you
finish
we need to go to the Oscars okay okay
time to get serious here follow me into
the newsroom but the best reason of all
is I live in the newsroom I have all the
necessary experience that would make me
the best red carpet reporter you've ever
seen whether it's hosting local station
TV 32 or doing field work for Sports
zone three game launch party we're here
in the fabulous basketball court for the
fantastic game of the perfect wave
hosting my own daily entertainment news
show hosting a weekly celebrity news
blog about how excited I was for the
upcoming Kim Kardashian Kris Humphries
fairytale wedding oh wait maybe that's
because it was just a few days ago or
writing for my own personal celebrity
blog I do it all and of course I have
great interview skills we are here with
a student a red carpet expert to talk to
him about why I would make the best red
harder for her ever so Lou why because
she's awesome

you absolutely I have the talent the
passion the work ethic but most of all I
have the dream to be a red carpet
reporter and now all I need to make this
dream come true is a little help from
all of you and a red carpet of course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
