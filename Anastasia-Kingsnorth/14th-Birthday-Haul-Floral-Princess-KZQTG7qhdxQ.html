video is going to be a 14th birthday
haul so because I have my own youtube
long enough to do a birthday haul before
this was so requested and I wanted to do
one really bad but I didn't know whether
to but I'm going to because of how many
people really wanted it off by saying
that I'm not trying to brag about in any
way shape or form I am extremely
grateful for any messages videos edit
gifts anything that I received on my
birthday I was so so so grateful for and
I still am I love everything to pieces
and everybody who got me something or
everybody just said happy birthday makes
me so so happy so thank you so much I'm
going to sort of who my family got me
and then gone to my friends and then my
viewers so first of all I'm going to do
what my mum got me so my mum actually
got me something that I've been wanting
for so so so long and it's the Alex 9
drawer unit so obviously I can't pick it
up and show it because it's so so heavy
but I'm gonna overnight know two clips
of it and it's going to be where I'm
going to be storing all of my makeup and
because I now have my makeup how I want
it I'll be doing a makeup collection and
even my next video or the video after
that so definitely very soon but this is
the 9 drawer unit and I believe this was
90 pounds and I'm extremely grateful for
it so thank you so much more to go in
with the Alex Android unit she also
ordered me the Muji separators and I got
the idea of velvet ghost or Gabriella or
Gabi however you like to name her and
she uses the Muji separators in her
longer Alex drawers and I really liked
how they looked so my mum got me 20
pounds worth of those and I actually
only have three drawers full of makeup
but I just separated them out into face
eyes and lips and each of them how about
four separators in so I think it's
really handy to have the separators and
I will link everything down below what
she's got on top of my Alex unit my mum
got me this and this is just the candle
stand that Anna Dragonetti has so Anna
dragonetti's makeup collection how she
has like on top of the eyebrows has
completely inspired mine and I really
wanted one to be a little bit like hers
so my mum got me the candle stand and I
loved that and that was from Ikea for
five pounds mum also got me a couple
things to go with the things that you
got me so first of all she got me a
phone case and it's just the like bumper
phone case and it's just pastel pink I
don't know how well you can see it but
and then on the back it has like a
plastic thing and the ID you really like
this and I know that I was getting this
because I asked her for it but it was
only 2 pounds from Amazon and I loved
that and then also picked me up the
jelly bean bean boozled challenge so me
number actually do some of these
yesterday on my actual birthday and I
wanted to be sick I had we did the vomit
and peach won and I got vomit and I've
got peach and then we did the canned dog
food and chocolate pudding one and amber
got canned dog food and I've got
chocolate pudding but we've saved like
pretty much the whole box so if you
would like me to do an actual like bean
boozled challenge video just let me know
because I would have to do one because I
haven't tried all the flavors and I am
absolutely dreading - my mum also got me
something from lush so once I watched
her mother's lush rule I was like ok I
need to go to lush so when I go to
London on Saturday I'm going to be
getting loads of lush and doing a huge
lush haul but my mum got me the pumpkin
and it's so autumn and all like I
absolutely love it like it just goes
with my settings so much and it's just a
glittery pumpkin and it looks so much
like a pumpkin as well and it's just a
bubble bar and I absolutely love this
I'm going to be using it on Friday when
me and ever have like a pamper evening
and yeah I'm definitely gonna be buying
another one of these on Saturday finally
my mum also got me two Mac products
which I was so shocked about so she got
me a mac lipstick in hugged me and this
is just a gorgeous brownie or terminal
nude I didn't have any brown news before
so I felt like I should get one so I
kind of asked her for this I put it on
my birthday list and she got me and she
then also got me something I've been
wanting from Mac of so long and it's the
Mac foundation so I am aware that Mac
may test on animals for their
foundations but I still really wanted to
try one
so please no comment anything like that
because I am aware but I still really
want to try one so I got the ik Studio
Fix fluid in NC 50 and I also did get
the pump but once you put the pump in
like you can't put the lid on so I'm
just going to be kind of waiting until I
actually use the foundation my dad my
dad just gave me money and he also got
me a moon picker but I'm Way too
embarrassed
it because it has me as a little girl on
it and I look kind of cute but I don't
really want to show it because it's kind
of embarrassing but I may post a picture
of it on my Instagram so if you want to
go and follow my Instagram
it will probably be somewhere over the
screen in part of this video will be in
the description box down below
ba also took me and I were out for a
meal and when I got there my sister was
there and I haven't seen her in so so
long and my sister actually got me a
present so she got me a cushion she
actually made it and it says floral
princess on it and I was so so happy
with this I'm just keeping it on my bed
I absolutely love it because she took
the time made it for me and I'm so so
grateful for it so thank you so much dad
and Louis from my little brother because
he's obviously too like young to choose
anything he's only six months old my mum
chose something and divergent on DVD I
haven't actually seen divergent yet but
I really wanted to so she got me this
and we're going to be me and we're going
to be watching this on Friday when we
have like a little pamper evening
