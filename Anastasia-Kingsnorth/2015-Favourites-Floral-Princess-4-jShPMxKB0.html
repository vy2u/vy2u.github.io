going to be doing my 2015 favorites I
have wanted to do this video for the
longest time and I don't know why I
didn't do it last year I really wanted
to do it and I remember like in August
thinking I wanted to do a 2015 favorites
but it's finally the end of the year and
it's finally time I can do one and I'm
so excited because I never ever do
favorites videos but I feel like I
should do one because this is kind of a
roundup of all my favorites and if you
do want me to do them let me know in the
comments and I will do them more often
but yeah this is kind of like a roundup
this is also a collab video with my
amazing friend Keith Bennett if you
don't know who she is I don't know where
you have been she is so close to a
hundred K well I'm filming this I'm
pretty sure she's only like 3,000 off I
always go to like every YouTube event
with her and she's so lovely so make
sure you go down below and watch her
video after there she's also doing a
2015 favorites so I will link that video
down below but yeah as I said I'm gonna
be doing a 2015 favorite so I hope you
enjoyed the video and let's get started
so the first thing I'm going to talk
about I'm pretty short is a lot of
people's favorites and it's definitely
my favorite throughout the year and it's
the collection lasting perfection
concealer if I didn't mention already
this is a beauty favorites and I'm going
to talk about like all of my favorite
Beauty things but this is definitely the
best concealer of 2015 I'm sure there's
a lot of people's best concealer I
actually heard rumors that has been
discontinued which I see no sense in I
don't see that at all because the amount
of people that love this and the amount
of people have bought this is like
astronomical so why they would
discontinue it I have no idea but it's
only for past 19 and is a concealer it
is just amazing it covers all of my
spots it's so creamy
it doesn't look orange which is the
thing I love it actually looks like a
creamy whitish color very peach a very
peach tone definitely not orange toned
which is why I love it so this is
definitely one of my favorites another
one of my favorites is definitely the
L'Oreal Paris true match foundation I
have loved this for very very long I
think I started using it in around March
this year and it was the best foundation
I've never used another foundation
really other than the lobby out
infallible but this is still my favorite
this one doesn't go Orange again like
the collection you can see that doesn't
go Orange which is why I like it because
I find that I put my
foundations like on my face they look
perfectly fine in the bottle that on my
face and they dry orange I don't
understand what happened but I love this
foundation because it doesn't do that
and this is my perfect shade I have the
sticker come off but I know it's one of
the lighter shades and yeah I just love
this foundation so favorite foundation
of 2015 I've then I also recently been
using I think from around September
maybe the Real Techniques complexion
sponge to blend it all in I previously
used the expert face brush and I loved
that don't get me wrong but then I
started using this and I've had this for
ever literally forever and I've never
used it and amber started to use it and
also you know what you'll make oh shoot
I just dropped here and I'm not going to
get out frog it's gone right over there
but and the started using it and I was
like you know what your foundation and
your skin's so flawless I started to use
it made a huge difference to my makeup
so I definitely recommend using a sponge
to blend because they're amazing I think
they were techniques when there's only
about 4 or 5 pounds and the Beauty
Blender like the real Beauty Blender I
have no idea cuz I've never tried it
but I love that I know the favorite this
year has also been my sleek rose gold
blush I've used this in so many
tutorials so much I think you guys are
getting annoyed because I keep using it
so I've tried to stop using it now but
I've always used this blush it is really
the best blush I was gonna say since it
really have no idea how that came up my
mouth but I love this color so much it
is a dupe for the NARS orgasm which I do
have now but I still love this because
for 450 it's so pigmented and amazing
favorite blush of 2015 also absolutely
love the bomb mary-lou manizer again
this has been my favorite highlighter of
2015 I have it on now I don't know how
well you can see it but it is the only
highlighter in my collection that is so
pigmented that you can just touch it
lightly and you have it all on your
fingers it is amazing and the pad is so
deep as well like it's not the cheapest
I think it's about 15 pounds and you can
get it from super drive now for about 20
on the line on the line on or on line
but it's so good I love this and I think
they also have another one which I would
like to try but this is really really
good and this is dead
my favorite highlighter for mascaras I
have to mascara - I've loved this year
one from drug store one from high-end my
favorite drugstore one is at the
Maybelline lash sensational I absolutely
love this it is so good I recently got a
new one for Christmas which is why this
looks so like new but I got this
straight away as soon as it came out
this year and it is hands-down the best
I have this on today and I love this so
much it's only 8 pounds as well and the
packaging is really beautiful so love
that my high-end one is from Too Faced
and is he - Faced better than sex
mascara now this mascara looks very
expensive because the packaging is quite
heavy it's made out of a really good
solid material and it's a gorgeous like
rich pink color and the wand is
something that I never would have
thought would have been that great
because I'm always used to like having
these type of ones and the ones that
come with the rocket mascara but this
one is amazing and one coat lashes go
straight up it is amazing and definitely
recommend this so these two of
definitely been my favorite mascara of
2015 for lip products I've always been
the kind of nude brown color - red type
of girl I don't really like the rigs at
my tiny berries by that I I've always
been that type of color I don't suit
pink that while I think I'm much prefer
dark colors even though I do wear light
colors a lot so my first color which is
B my favorite is Mac hug me and this is
a gorgeous nude this is what I have on
today I love this so so so much it
smells amazing not that that has any
relevance II to the lipstick but it is
amazing and it used it quite a bit that
it's going down now which is quite
depressing so I will have to buy another
one when it runs out but I love this so
much
and even though Mac lips it's are 1550
they are so worth the money I then love
the NYX intense butter gloss and I've
got is pretty recently actually but
these type of things have always been my
favorite and this is in the shade
toasted marshmallow and I have this on
in my last video I told everybody it was
called berry it was not good berry I'm
so sorry I got the name mixed up it's
called toasted marshmallow and I love
this color so much and she's like my
perfect type of red berry color
and I love it so much so these two have
definitely Brent's of my favorite lip
product in 2015 for skincare I am gonna
do a skincare routine because so many
people said to me how did you clear up
your skin sorry I'm really uncomfortable
that so many people said to me how did
you clear up your skin and it was
literally the Elizabeth and Polish this
is just a mini because the big one is
like quite big and it wouldn't really
fit in my shop without nothing right odd
but this is just a mini what I take with
me and I use this to get all of my
makeup off and then I just cleanse with
it using the hot cloth that comes with
it and this is clear that my skin
immensely I feel so much more confident
in my own skin now that I'll go out
without my makeup on and I just love it
so much
and I cannot thank them for making this
product enough because it is really made
for a lot more confident and I love this
so much if you have quite a few spots or
like red blemishes this is perfect
another like skin care product but for
your body something I've I've been
loving that didn't make sense no what I
mean is the body shot
strawberry body sorbet I never really
speak about the body shop stuff and I
don't know why because I have so much a
bit but I love this so much
and the only way I can describe it is it
it smells of childhood and as soon as
you smell it you know exactly what I
mean if I cut my finger and what it
smells like oh my god it just now was
insane and when you're putting it on it
just eats smooth as the hell oh my god I
didn't just sweat it okay so he's here
and I love it so much it is just so good
so please go try this this is a new
bottle I've been to about three of these
this year and also have ones down there
also have the peach one amazing so I've
been Glory it has also been really good
to me this year and I love Soph and
glory
I love their smoothie star scent so
these are the mini so I got Christmas
but I do have the full-size in my
drawers which I've been using and this
is the breakfast scrub and the smoothie
style body butter cream these are insane
and I cannot wait to use these minis up
oh my gosh
this smell is like my favorite ever
smell from like soap &amp;amp; Glory
I love the smoothie star smell smells
amazing and I love these mini pots I
think they look so cute so yes those
fabulous I'm finally for hair products I
don't really like use much hair products
I've recently got a new she'll be okay
which I mean I haven't used it yet so
don't know if it's good or not but I'll
keep you updated but this is the OGX
weightless hydration coconut water and I
love this so much
hi this is my second bottle and I
started it in about August it smells
amazing it's gonna spray a bit oh my god
you just spray it all over your hair and
just like rub it in and it smells so
good to house like coconut and it's just
like makes it look very silky I think
and even though it looks a bit wet I
spread it very close to my hair then
oops but I love this and it smells
amazing and I definitely recommend it so
that is my 2015 favourites video I just
