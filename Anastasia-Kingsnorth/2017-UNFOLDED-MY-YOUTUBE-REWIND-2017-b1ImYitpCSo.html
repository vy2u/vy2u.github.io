today's video I am going to be doing an
overview of my 2017 and kind of like a
big thank you to you guys basically I
don't really know what this video is but
I just wanted to make it because I just
wanted to thank you I don't you don't
know what I'm gonna title it don't
really know what I'm gonna talk about to
be honest but I just kind of want to
make a video summarizing my 2017 and
thanking you guys for it occurs without
any of you it wouldn't be possible
because this year I have done some of
the most amazing things and it's all
down to you guys and I just kind of want
to do it as an overview set some goals
for 2018 and yeah basically I would chat
with you also quick sidenote
I do have a jump run it's just like a
really like off-the-shoulder one it's on
this shoulder off that shoulder just I
can't file apps and nobody thinks I'm
filming a video naked I really hope you
guys enjoyed this video if you do
remember to give it a huge thumbs up and
without further ado let's get into the
video I have wrote down all the months
on my phone and I'm gonna like kind of
put in like the key things that have
happened things that I haven't actually
properly spoken to you guys about and
there's different things that have made
it kind of like a mark in my life this
year so first of all we go saw after
January January nothing really that
exciting happened
January was quite just like January it
was cut just like bland I was basically
just in revision because I had my GCSEs
and I also went to my first like proper
party where it's like I was lazy I was
going to Instagram and I saw the photo
of me and Ambrose oh my god we went to
like my first proper party and it was
really good I still remember it like
clear as day and yeah that's basically
what my January was I didn't really do
much with my life then I was obviously
so making videos for you guys but don't
mean I just can't think of anything that
monumental that happened in my January
in February something happened that kind
of like changed my perspective on
everything cause it kind of made me
realize like wow like I'm so lucky to be
in this industry
and I went to an event with L'Oreal it
was their launch for their color Easter
hair range and it was a massive range it
was a massive launch and I didn't
at the time how big it was we were put
in a hotel that night and I was there
with SAFF jazz Luis Layla Sabrina Roxy
like there's so many of us he was there
and if I could find the photo I'll put
the photo on screen I've got the photo
on my memo board up there we basically
just like saw the head L'Oreal hair
artist and Louisa Johnson performed and
I saw so many people that I've looked up
to and I just felt so amazed to be there
because one I love L'Oreal is a brand
I'm obsessed with their makeup their
true match foundation is on my favs
their hair range is incredible and just
to be there was such a surreal
experience even though I've done like
beauty corner summer in the city before
that was kind of an event that like just
I can't explain it it just changed my
whole outlook on everything that night
me and staff went to Western breakfast
and food we met up with Harvey it was
really really fun and I just loved that
day so much like I will remember that
day forever and it was the first day
that I actually kind of like dressed up
a little bit more cuz I never used to
reload ress up so yeah I always remember
that day then in March I went to a
concert I went to see Drake perform live
with my mum and amber and again this was
something that was really monumental to
me because I loved Drake I've loved him
for a long long time and the fact I got
to go see him live at the o2 it was like
it would start just a real experience I
can't explain it but he said some like
really prominent words he said this
speech and it's like memory was
obviously he said it to everybody in
that room but I remember like sitting I
literally remember sitting there and
thinking like I want to be onstage I
want to like Beyonce I just well that's
what I want to do with my life and the
fact that I got to do that I'm not the
southern line which I'll talk about like
it just shows that dreams come true and
he basically did this thing where he was
like eff the hater as he got everybody
to put their like middle fingers up in
the air and he just like hit hard like
me number both said it was just like
such a hard hitting moment in my life
that I will never ever forget and it was
such a surreal experience and I loved it
so much so that was a kind of big thing
that happened in March for me and it was
amazing in April to things - very kind
of big things happened so the first
thing was I went to answer
for VidCon Europe which was insane I've
never been to VidCon before obviously it
happened in America and I've only ever
been to Florida on a family holiday
I've never been to like LA or anything
like that and staff miss me she was like
hey like come to VidCon with us and I
was like oh my god okay I'm so excited
now so we flip out it was me Asaf wendy
and darwan it was such a nice few days I
loved it so much we went to VidCon for
two of the days then we also met up with
some of our friends out there which was
really nice and we just did some amazing
things that I would never forget all of
us for just really like so many funny
memories and it was such a good trip and
that was kind of like I don't know again
like going abroad to YouTube convention
was a crazy and the fact that I met a
lot of you out there in Amsterdam as
well like that was crazy to me that
there was viewers who watched me in
Amsterdam I couldn't believe it and that
was a big big thing and again I've got
my pass my VidCon pass up there on my
memo board because I'll like put a photo
in but I have a memo board of like
everything that I've done this year and
it's so amazing the second big thing was
I can't actually say or maybe I can say
I don't know but I don't want to risk it
just in case I can't but I actually got
contacted by a TV agent turns on what
you call it like a channel they Kofi's
my business email they wanted me to
audition for this new show that is
airing in January and me and my mom were
like wow this is like such an amazing
thing like I'm definitely gonna audition
so we had like the interviews and stuff
and it's just awards at the end of April
beginning of May and I got casted for it
straight away they said they really
wanted me in it and it was literally
like man it hasn't aired yet it's airing
in January I can't really say exactly
what it is yet but I'll tell you more as
I talk about the months if that makes
sense
they'll be heading to May and maybe what
I do see I see started so nothing really
monumental happens here with YouTube
because I was so focused on my GCSEs ice
at 23 exams and there were some of the
hardest exams ever like I did struggle
especially with maths I passed by I did
struggle I was so happy with my grades
in the end I did a video like reacting
to our GCSE results June obviously GCSEs
again they carried on for the majority
of the month and then I had prom and
the documentary that is going to be
coming out was surrounding my prom I'm
not the only person in it I think
there's six individuals in it but it was
surrounding my prom because other people
asked that why didn't you vlog prom like
why didn't you film it and it was
because it was being filmed already and
it is gonna be aired on TV that's kind
of crazy to me and that's like I
genuinely couldn't believe it is such a
monumental time and I love my prom so
much I've got my dream dress my mum got
it made for me which again it was insane
and I'll put photos in and it was such a
beautiful night and then we stayed in a
hotel that night and we had an amazing
afterparty
and it was so so so good end of June me
poppy and Katie went on a trip together
because Katie was actually moving away
in July and we went to thought park and
London it was the last time us they were
going to be together for a long long
time and it was amazing we loved it so
much if we only went us three and Katie
and poppy and notes on that before I've
been away by myself
yeah it was amazing I loved it then in
July again we finished filming the
documentary and then something kind of
like hard hit because Katie actually
left
Katie moved to Liverpool and it was
something that really hit me hard
because Katie wasn't is still one of my
best friends and she looked she lived
over the road from me so we see each
other every day
we've revised together we do pretty much
like everything together we were really
close and then she moved to Liverpool
for a fresh start like refreshed up for
a levels and her family wanted a fresh
start and it really hit me hard because
I I don't know I just I relied on Kate
you for a lot of things and I think she
would add on me for a lot of things as
well so when she moved away that hit me
really hard especially through the
summer because we wanted to do a lot
together and we couldn't I've seen her
twice since twice yeah twice since and
it's been amazing like we may not be ad
clothes anymore but I will always love
it to pieces
and she'll always be one of my best
friends then in July I was like so lucky
because benefit actually took me to
loads of different places so I went to
love box festival with benefit I went to
Wireless Festival and then they made
this amazing thing called it Benny
Ireland and I got to take amber which
was a big thing because it was like
Amber's first kind of YouTube trip with
me and we went with SAFF and Lucy and so
many amazing people we had the most
amazing time and they literally hired
this whole island
or influences it was crazy and again
I've got loads of pictures on there and
I'll insert those of pictures there was
like an amazing pool with floats and
because I didn't get to go abroad in
somebody literally felt like I was on
holiday I also started my rock channel
in July which now has over 150,000
subscribers that was a monumental step
in my youtube journey because I always
wanted to blog but I was always too
scared then that would I just said you
know what Sunday I'm going to start my
rock channel and I did it and best thing
I've ever done I now love vlogging so
having something ready go sub in August
I went to summer in the city and I
didn't go to summer in city in 2016 I
went in 2015 didn't go last year and
then this year it just kind of hit me I
met so many of you I did a meet-up with
Eve that had 250 people we did a Fisher
with summer in the city and I met so
many of you walking around and I will
never forget that experience it was
amazing and not to mention the parties
as well that studio71 three so good
August I also hit 300,000 subscribers
and I released my merchandise which
again was a big part because stay classy
which is my merchandise range is
something that is very close to my heart
and I really really love it it's a
classy user cause I always live by and
yeah I bought out jumpers hoodies
t-shirts they will be going back in
stock soon and they sold out and went
out of stock but they will be coming
back very soon and it's always linked
down below but that launched that month
and they sold out summer in the city as
well so as you can see what the months
just got better and better and it was
insane in August I also went on a shoot
with MAC Cosmetics and they asked me to
be one of their Mac girls for the
campaign with their five new pallets
that they were doing and I was the
American girl for the palette fashion
fanatic and again that was something
that was insane for me that was my first
ever kind of like makeup shoot and I had
to do my makeup and there was like
makeup artists and proper cameramen it
was all very strange
I felt very weird because obviously
normally I'm alone in my room talking to
you guys and suddenly there's a load of
people so it was very very strange but I
loved every minute of it and that was
something that I would never ever forget
in September September kind of took a
toll on me it wasn't a very good month
emotionally I felt really down I felt
really motivated I made a massive
decision to not go to six form to do my
courses at home online and to try give
YouTube a go full-time I still do my
courses online and I talked about that
in my vlogs if you want to like hear me
talk about that but obviously and I
chose that decision so I could do
YouTube more and so far it's been the
best decision of my life I've been ten
times happier since I dad
and even though the summer was amazing
like these past four months since I've
decided to make this decision I felt so
much less stress and I've just
absolutely loved my life is so much the
reason I got to do that was all sat down
to you guys so thank you so much from
the bottom of my heart because I don't
know where I'd be without you and I'm
such a better person because of it in
October I turned 17 and October was a
bit of a whirlwind month as you're gonna
hear I did the most amazing things I
knocked over was a month I would never
forget first of all I got to work with
Disney me and staff hosted the live
stream for descendants two and we got to
meet Thomas Daugherty and dove Cameron
and we did it we've live in ez whoever
Disney Channel vloggers and it was so
much fun like I couldn't believe that
Disney had asked me to do that I have
been a Disney kid I'm a Disney kid at
heart I love all the movies I loved his
name it's Disney man so many times and
it was so surreal being on certain
Disney and helped me to present that
live stream was such a monumental thing
and I would never forget it Disney
things it took a huge room and it's kind
of done up like a living room I guess so
this is where it dove is gonna be
sitting and this is where Tommy sit yeah
and then a few days after that I went to
the Nickelodeon slime fest and I got to
walk the orange or red car whoever you
want to call it
I can't acrylics I didn't get his
dressed up as I probably should off I
didn't realize how dressed up I should
have got but it was amazing and it was
one of the first red slash orange
carpets I'd ever walked
I'd walked a black carpet at tulley's
but this is kind of the first proper
like pop picks whatever and I'll put it
on screen but it was amazing and towards
the end of the month
it was hello world and this was
something this is probably the biggest
highlight of my year hello world was a
live immersive event where basically all
your favorite you
got together we were walking around so
you could meet us we put on a live
performance and this is what I was
talking about when I mentioned Drake for
me I've done YouTube on this channel and
another channel since I was 11 years old
and I've looked up to people who are at
hello world for absolute years there was
so many people there who at one time and
still now I found out over inside
because I loved their videos I've
watched them for years and they still
hold a special place in my heart and to
be there with them on the lineup was
something that I will never be able to
forget because I don't understand how I
got in that position it just is crazy to
me and I remember walking around like
looking at everybody thinking down like
how right here with you it was crazy and
then I didn't really do much in the live
show I walked on as part of sassed it
which was amazing because obviously
there was like 6,000 people in the
audience and to be on stage was
something that I even though I wasn't
really doing much or something that I
always wanted to do and I thought about
when I was at Drake in March and
obviously I knew nothing about hello
world at that point and then at the end
all the youtubers went on as the vamps
sang their song live and again that was
probably one of the most monumental
times in my life just because I was on
stage of so many people that I admired
in front of a load of you guys and I was
just like mind blown like literally mind
blown so now you that weren't impossible
and genuinely that was the best days of
my life
it's all done it actually looks so
so she asked me to walk her meeting
people I'm gonna block me instead in
November this is really exciting as well
million and staff took our first trip
away just us and we went to Paris that
we stayed in the most amazing hotel we
made so many amazing memories the trip
kind of went wrong to a point because we
didn't get to do as much as he wanted to
do but nevertheless we made the best
memories and we always said we're gonna
go to Paris and you know what we thought
finally we're gonna do it right before
vlogmas we're gonna go to Paris and we
did it
I've logged the whole trip so if you do
wanna hear me talk more about it then
you can go watch the vlogs but it was
something that I always hold in my heart
forever and I loved it I think this is
the coolest thing I know it's just a
telescope how amazing is this you how
amazing
is a dreamer just waiting to be awakened
and then you know them we're also got to
work with McDonald's and like if you
guys watch my vlogs you know I love
McDonald's I always have like HSN
addiction nobody's liked you too much
there I probably do but you know what
I'm gonna make the most of my life while
I'm young and I'm gonna eat as many
McDonald's as I want because I can I
really really love McDonald's and when
they wanted to work with me I was
literally over the moon so you know
that's not how to say that and then
December this is where we are now blog
mercy 2017 is coming to an end and I
just had the most amazing year and it is
all down to you watching this without
you I couldn't have done any of the
things I done this year you have
literally changed my life forever my
family's life forever and it is amazing
feel emotional like talking about it
because at one stage I never in a
million years thought I would be where I
am now and I might not be the big issue
humor out there and I might not have as
many subscribers as some people but I it
doesn't matter to me like I'm doing what
I love and I'm making people happy and
that's all that matters I've met the
most amazing people through YouTube I
wouldn't know like three-quarters of the
people in my life and that's it was for
YouTube like it's actually insane to
think that YouTube has changed my life
as much as it has because I honestly
don't know where I'd be without it like
I genuinely don't I just want to take
this time to thank you every single one
of you for watching this for changing my
life
and making my dreams come true sounds
really cheesy but you really really have
and anybody who says dreams don't come
true
they're lying dreams do come true if you
put the hard work in and you truly
believe that they're gonna come true
they will and that's why this video is
basically gonna end just on a little
thank you and I just want to talk to you
and tell you guys how you have changed
my life and that I really really
appreciate you in 2018 I feel like it's
gonna be really good I want to meet so
many of you I want to do so many things
and I'm looking forward to looking back
on 2018 and seeing if the things that
are in my head right now which I wrote
down on my phone come true and if they
do then I'm gonna tell you guys at the
end of the year I love you always so so
much thank you for the best year I wish
you all the love
happiness in 2018 or say I'm not going
anywhere still get two videos a week and
a load of logs from me so I love you all
so to so much and OC racing for a brand
new video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
