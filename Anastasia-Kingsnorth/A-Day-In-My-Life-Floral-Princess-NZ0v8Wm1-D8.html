to be a day in the life video so the
first thing I do in the morning is just
sit on my phone and get ready and if I'm
going out I will just get ready and put
my bag on and stuff so then we set out
in the car when you're actually going
shopping today and we're going to Milton
Keynes Shopping Center so we just drove
to Milton Keynes in the car and when we
first got there we looked at the
Christmas display as their Christmas
display is a phenomenal it's just
beautiful that I had to take so many
pictures and so many videos it's just a
gorgeous if you get the chance to go
definitely go so after we looked at the
Christmas display we went debenhams and
Mac and we developed all the different
matte lipsticks and he was just watching
them all and swatching basically every
single lipstick and every single blush
as well and then we just went into
Topshop and tried on some of their
clothes and we just was really goofing
around in the changing room he just took
so many things in and we were just
trying loads of things on it was really
funny so when we come out of Topshop we
actually went to loads of different
shops like lush and the Disney Store and
in the Disney Store I wanted to laugh so
bad but I think I've got in for
Christmas so I just gave him a hug and
hopefully y'all getting for Christmas
and they have this awesome like Disney
Castle and we went in that and we just
looked at all of the Disney Princesses
that appeared on the mirror
so I could personally go shopping
without looking at Yankee Candles so we
actually went to a garden center to look
at these and this is just pulling ting
garden center and I just melt loads of
the Christmas scents I actually found
merry marshmallow which I thought it's
been discontinued this year so I
definitely had to buy it as they only
had two left so I bought that in a
medium jar and yeah that's basically my
favorite candle now so when we'd
finished they actually had reindeers so
we got some carrots and we started to
feed the reindeers and I took loads of
clips of the Christmas lights at this
garden centre because there was just so
many and the trees were so so tall and
they just had Christmas lights on so I
fed the reindeers and carrots I just fed
two different reindeers two different
carrots because yeah I thought I should
feed them because I've only get to see
reindeers once a year at Christmastime
and they were actually going back to the
North Pole as they said as they told us
tomorrow so yeah so when we were on our
way home we actually went spotting for
Christmas lights this is something we
love to do around Christmastime and we
saw some amazing Christmas lights this
one was so old-fashioned they literally
hung them everywhere around their house
and all over their trees it was just so
pretty
I really love looking at Christmas
lights when I got home I was so tired so
I just got a glass of water and started
as always but when I'm actually gave me
early because I really wanted to read it
so yeah I tried to make this look like
we heart it don't know if it worked let
me know if you think it did but yeah
that's basically what I did so this is a
collab with the amazing Ellen of CW make
