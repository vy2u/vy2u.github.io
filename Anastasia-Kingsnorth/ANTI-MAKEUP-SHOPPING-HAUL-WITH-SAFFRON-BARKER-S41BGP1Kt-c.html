background mm-hmm how incredible does it
look with the fairy lights
yeah my perlier Ali looks so good so
today we are actually going to be
filming a video that I've been you're
just not comfortable sorry you know just
like not comfy okay so today we're gonna
be filming a video that I've seen
floating around on YouTube and we were
like because it's actually a really good
idea we saw soaked as nails do it is
basically an auntie Hawk so we're gonna
be showing you guys things that we're
not actually going to buy and explain to
you why and burning on all these
products are actually fairly new out so
they're kind of like majority yeah
jority yeah you definitely would have
heard of the product because they're all
over social media at the moment we are
also filling a video over on staff a
channel but basically with me we do like
a part 1 and part 2 so whatever one you
watch you can they go watch the other so
being in doing the exact same video on
Sakura's channel with another like set
of products so major to go stop my
channel to see thee like other half yeah
mom goes me it better be entertaining
because otherwise why they're gonna want
to watch a part two I was like mom have
you seen us with Toby kin but liking of
entertaining began I see video so I
really hope you enjoy it and let's get
started you point that way yeah we might
put that way at home but I got that
never went that way I don't know what
I'm always really really affects lives
from that way did it
no it's not that way but does it like
that huh and it goes yeah yeah right so
the first product you definitely would
have heard of and it's the Kim
Kardashian contour kit okay right I've
seen very very mixed reviews about this
on the internet especially I watched
Lewis's video and the thing is you
barely get any product yeah I mean I
don't think I'll buy it
also because white shipping and
saturating is in the UK then a lot more
a lot more likely that I definitely go
and buy air also as well I think the
colors are really light yes the colors
are very
if I could walk into a shop here and
swatch it and maybe try it myself
they're like I probably would buy
it but with the ship in other taxes it's
everything on top of it and everybody's
saying that like in the stick version of
it because obviously should pull it out
and like a powder version now but in the
stick you get like that much and it's
like that big yeah and people are saying
it snaps off as well oh wait so it's
actually completely different yeah oh
that's bad
so yeah I put on don't throw B if he Fe
with you like I don't know yeah I think
Lewis said it cost like 80 pounds for
him to get the stick and I was like I
don't know I like it looks good but I
just don't think I spend my money on
that I'd rather go buy something I was
like a hundred percent no yeah gonna be
really good okay so mine is the Jaclyn
hill moorthi collaboration and so
basically they came out with a palette
they does look very beautiful don't get
me wrong I think the colors do look very
beautiful
however like I've done honestly I really
respect her I think she's an amazing the
makeup are yes it's nothing against her
however I just I know for a fact I don't
think I would use many of the colors on
the bottom line is they're not the
bottom two lines of fat the top three
lines are very me I think code yellow
but the bottom two not so much
also I think with morphe the palettes
are normally like a reasonable price
where this one's a lot more expensive
than a normal order to ensue yeah oh I
just no no no more morphe palette and
also most of the colors on the top three
lines I've got from the morphe 35o
palette so just were like why go buy a
whole nother palette when I've got all
the colors anyway by morphing it's very
much like a rainbow palette because
you've basically got like this like
blues greens yellows yeah it's like
everything to me it's kind of good it's
a bit of everything if everything but I
don't know why I would wear like blue
eyeshadow or green eyes all right
anybody nice so like I known as like a
real iceberg Andy Cohen really likes
oranges and stuff which I definitely
would use that everything else come yeah
I've got it already like static light in
the 35 you kind of have those shades
already so yeah I agree with you yeah
also like I prefer I don't know how much
I like the silver package in the
packaging yeah I'd prefer black I know
emailing black I don't know yeah I don't
know
it depends because it can look tacky
that's why I was thinking like oh
because I really like her makeup but as
long as they're with him but but have
not you seen the front of the palette I
just know that it's today we know we
have a looks I haven't actually seen I
don't know if it says like morphe X
Jaclyn or right yeah oh yes it's got
like my message inside I like the
message the message is really nice
that's really cute
I'm just not sure about the whole thing
yeah the top three lines I definitely
used with the top two and yeah I mean
some colors on there I would use oh no I
think that oh it's not why obvi awesome
white if it's gonna go all my other
palettes it's just a dirty that is basic
everyday 3/5 are like fingerprints yes
so it's okay for me yeah
the next product that I don't think I
will be buying is the huda beauty desert
dusk palette have you seen this no let
me show you a picture of it yeah show me
a pic I really want the huge Beauty rose
gold palette that's something that I
actually do really want to buy yes I've
seen that that's amazing it was
incredible doesn't know I just haven't
bought it yet so the desert dust palette
was all my searches already so I really
liked it I really do like it but I just
don't know how much use I would get out
of it for the price that we have 60
pounds as bad as it sounds I wanted the
palette just because it has a color
that's good saffron color I per say
because to be honest I have the other
hood huda beauty palette and I literally
thought it was something my favorite fat
palatable time and look-wise it's
absolutely sweet remember what it's
called the other one that's recently got
one yeah well that's see that yes that
looks incredible yes actually not that
amazing yeah because I feel like it
shows oppressed
Genoa and they were like loose pigment I
think they'd probably be better it
really look like as amazing the glitters
and if you're in the desert dust I'm not
really that keen on them oh yeah I
probably use like one of them I know
that the purple like yeah but like the
pony happen at the palette I don't
really see the point of getting a one
yeah cuz they look very soon other
colors that I like I have on the other
yeah I don't know I'm not really liking
the purples I know they like a bit of an
odd shade of purple I forgot for sixty
pounds that's expensive you could get
other palettes we've like more shades
like if we go back to morphe you can get
like is it thirty or forty changer and a
pound and that's still really planned
every good but that's like 18 shades for
sixty pounds so it's like it's hard to
weigh up I don't know it's a really hard
one yeah the news on that I've actually
chosen is the out by five is the
maybelline unicorn highlight just
becuase I feel like it is very pretty to
be first I'm like I said but I just know
for a fact that I do not want those
colors on my face like if I'm gonna if
I'm gonna go a bit adventurous it's
gonna be on my eyes like I just know for
a fact I won't be wearing blue on my
cheek
alright I just know that I won't use I
said Highland I just feel like it's
definitely gonna be a waste of money
when you said to me unicorn Hollow I was
yeah acting lilac yeah is that cold not
a solid red yellow blue and white I
don't know that's purple right I thought
it was purple yeah it comes up with oh
yeah you can really see how that I think
it's amazing and if you can put up off
your f initely but I just thought like I
definitely will not pull this oh I could
not say it was just like I smeared
makeup at my face yeah I tried the whole
you know known it the way I've ever
parties put it on they kind of put it on
away then it looks how it should but I
know whom I did that by the way I apply
my highlighter it would not look like
that yeah I think my look is really nice
for the highlight yeah as I said purple
isn't and I was like you could use it
for your eyes but like they actually
bite is a highlight and I just know I
wouldn't be using it so yeah I want is
definitely don't know for me the last
winner for my video that I personally
don't think I'm really buying is the
Kylie cosmetics birthday connection now
it's not because I don't think it looks
nice but the thing is I feel like when
Kylie first come out with her products
it was so exciting because there was
have many of them there was like six lip
kits I think so like everybody was so
excited I they promise but I feel like
ever since that she's brought out so so
many new products that it's just not as
exciting anymore because she's con
bringing out new collections and though
I remember being so excited the first
lip kits that she got and I all just saw
I think I've done like two orders off of
her but now I just feel like there's too
much to keep up women they're too big of
collections if you want everything I get
I do get what you're saying but I
flippin and love her birthday collection
but it looks incredible so she look why
I want to get that would you buy now I
would buy that he'll buy it now I think
it's sold out again it's a limited
amount one but like it doesn't it
doesn't look incredible yeah it's just I
remember like I think there was another
collection she come out with like the
holiday or vacation cuz I oh I have a
holiday collection do you have that yeah
it is it's good like it's just like her
normal cottages the pageants amazing
that's amazing I like the birthday
collection because they love the
packaging so it's like yeah there's a
birthday yeah I love that I mean there's
a lot of colors I wouldn't used to be
fair oh yeah I got back there's a lot of
colors I love you white purple I
definitely realized the reliable and
even the cards actually in the palette
I'm not sure I choose all of them it is
more just the packaging yeah over the
color I just actually flipping love the
packaging and the phone I'm using cronut
my Mikayla look up a sucker fraction yes
oh I'm a sucker for packaging the
package is incredible I just definitely
