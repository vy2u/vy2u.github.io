and I'm here with a special guest how
I'm here with Sophie from soft as nails
and I'm pretty sure you know who she is
and probably watch some of her videos
they are amazing and you guys have
wanted us to collab for so long it's
been a while yeah everybody says like
please do video Sophie so finally we're
here we're doing it into a house with no
background I love it and we're gonna be
filming a very Christmas themed video
today but we have also filmed a video
over on a Sophie's channel or John
explain what we did and yeah well we are
basically we have a bunch of products
from Poland and they're all gonna be
like randomly in a bag we have to pick
out five products each and do our entire
face of makeup with the five products
that we choose so we could have lipgloss
we could have a like eyebrow pencil and
then a few other products and then we
literally have to do our full face of
makeup or will yeah actually yeah I know
my like I'm gonna end up with having to
go check that out link with me at top
line of the description go watch but
before my video we're doing a bit of a
weird one really never seen this done
before on YouTube so we're just gonna
wing it
we're gonna go for it we're gonna be
doing a full face of makeup but applying
it with Christmas chocolate and food so
I basically got a Peppa Pig happen
calendar I've got minstrels
I've got Frodo I basically have so much
food and we were gonna be attempting to
apply our makeup using these as
applicators so no I don't know how so
obviously I'll make up some kind of look
amazing but we thought this would be
really fun so I hope you guys enjoy and
let's get started we are all barefaced
and we are ready to do this so these are
some of the sensitive products but
they're not really products okay
these are items because you've got a
candy cane we've got minstrels
we've got marshmallows which I feel like
they're gonna be the most you yeah then
I just bought a selection box trading
with Maltesers Twix Q and last long can
I love those and then we both have a
pick up in Canada because what would a
Christmas video be
an advent calendar yeah I don't know
what I'm gonna use the chocolate in this
for but I just really wanted to find a
way laws yet we'll find a way so we are
just gonna do our makeup basically with
God's using all these products which I'm
guessing I'm gonna have to go for the
martyr on fire yeah can I need to put
primer on my face what do I use my hands
for that normally baby primer on with
our hands without men using marshmallows
but there's like the rest of the stuff
yeah okay cause I'm so nervous for this
I've got the primer got my a Smashbox
photo-finish
color correcting you're just primates
green I didn't even bring a primer over
here so it's so good I mean I guess it's
Christmas themed because it's great it's
one my favorite things I feel like we
should have worn Christmas jumpers same
give me yours is red so you look
Christmassy any yeah I guess so it's
kind of its kind of themed so nervous
what's the smiler an host amazing but
stink
you know the Jelly Belly bean boozled
mmm it's gonna put my sticky stuff all
over face this is just gonna not work
got my marshmallow okay my Beauty
Blender oh sorry did we put our
foundation onto the marshmallow or did
we put it on our face on my face so I'm
gonna put it on my face I'm gonna mix
too cuz coverage um it's sleek life
proof foundation it's not my favorite
but I didn't want to waste like a good
foundation on this
yeah Jimmy I didn't really think about
it so I just bought my like everyday
makeup with them not thinking I'm gonna
have to use to ruin it yeah that food to
apply it so going in I'm going in I tell
you what the thing I'm most nervous for
is at the eyebrows so I'm like how on
earth I meant to do my eyebrows what I
normally do
it is but actually it smells so bad
and I've also just got my hair like
absolutely stinks all right dad why does
this matter what I smell so bad oh this
is so weird it feels kind of similar to
be better though oh my gosh look at oh
my she's making quite good
I think it's cuz I'm like if you are
puts so much foundation on yeah I'm
thinking I need a bit more Bowl it's
starting to get sticky and like melt
into my face oh look it's literally like
disintegrating oh my god you guys can
see this but isn't if you like coming
apart my face feels really sticky yeah
me too
oh we've got a power with basically
marshmallows Yoshi doesn't look too bad
on your cheek yeah I think it looks
quite good like to be fair my audition
today maker okay oh my god oh I think
you just took it
can you but I feel like in a way this
feels like the silicone blender it does
that's what I was thinking I need to put
quite a bit concealer on because the
more I blend it the less coverage I'm
getting now I need to get a new
marshmallow because that is disgusting
yes oh my god
yours is cut like why is mine going on
like bubbly mine soaked that is
disgusting foundation in so I'm gonna go
get a bin okay you know I'm gonna put on
the marshmallow move I'm gonna use my
top shape tape because uh oh your
coverage is gonna be next level oh my
it's working it's working okay I'm just
going to put it onto my face then blend
it just slipped into the marshmallow oh
wait I was about to put that on my face
that works better than what was actually
really good do you think yours doesn't
yours it's really smooth
Oh God okay I'm gonna stop learning that
now guess I'm just
there's I'm gonna powder myself you're
getting a lot on there this just isn't
having it this isn't actually the
weirdest thing putting a marshmallow
into your powder no I mean I mean it's
an interesting one for sure
mostly empty no yeah me too I like
disgusting but it worked just like it
worked how are we gonna okay wait first
we need to unwrap them yeah oh my kinda
broken a bit of an eye that actually not
too bad
okay so are we gonna get the same in
your way around he knows no probably not
gonna use the anastasia dipbrow I'm
using my freedom dipbrow which is
basically like the Joop oh my god I
picked up the wrong color this isn't
even this is in the shade ash brown oh
my god we're just gonna go with it
because it's sticky I mean it just looks
like nothing's going on oh my god it
kind of painful yeah it unveils laughs
on your face oh my gosh here they
already dark god I'm really running out
of this stuff I mean excuse to good I
knew oh my god it's actually melting
onto my hand my hands are so sticky yeah
my hand a ridiculously sticky right now
oh I just dropped it and I just dab to
my finger into it at the same time good
job I actually managed to get a little
bit of a fade oh that's too bad
I mean considering I've just done this
with a candy cane only it's better than
some people's eyebrows that I've seen I
mean it's too bad I don't have a shape
you actually do see I've just done my
favorite eyebrow but now I'm doing my
least favorite one and this just has no
shape to it was alone your eyebrows so
good oh my god I've just I just wiped
more of it on my face
great where is it coming from
are you joking me look how thick that
it's gone and I'm gonna have to write
the noise it's creeping my skin we're
gonna carve these out a little bit with
some concealer and I am gonna apply they
can seat you straight to my face because
I just can't put it on the marshmallow
whose idea was this kana because I'm
Marshall it's so big I can't see where
I'm going
Oh what do I do with this candy cane
it's actually disgusting should I save
it I'm gonna save it finally I thought
oh my god no so still it is a mixture of
like foundation and another marshmallow
oh my god actually feels like glass on
my face my fingers are so dirty and
covered in I broke every time I try and
wipe it off it's just putting more on my
face like oh my god safe to say I'm not
skilled well you know acquired skill I'm
just gonna leave it you know what is
this can't get much better what is the
next step in my makeup I think I'm gonna
do contour necks
yeah I'm gonna try contour what should
what what am I gonna get what are we
done my eyebrows um Rose Maltesers you
know what I think would be good for
contour quick twist let's do it is there
two in there was it just as one for
break in half
such a waste of a twigs so are you gonna
contour with the caramel bit need to
bend it down mm-hmm dookey this is gonna
be so bad I mean my contour is normally
questionable anyway but this is just
gonna be on another level it's just not
happening no really need to like dig it
in there like duh my face which I
basically have it
like mixing with the chocolate if the
chocolate melts and I can just blend
that into my face yeah I'm just gonna
use the chocolate oh my god mine is
actually just on this side oh this is oh
no I need to I need to throw this away
but I just give it up at this point I'm
trying to make it look good she's not
happening my chocolate is actually
solidified onto my face for my
highlighter which were quick okay I'm
just gonna I'm going in scraping that
freddo on my highlighter I mean it's
kind of coming off but it's a bit chunky
so I mean in the viewfinder it is pretty
good in real life it's definitely
questionable you're going oh yeah you're
glowing oh my god okay I need to work a
bit harder on this glow that's just Oh
some of the shock literally she just
broke off onto my face I'm on to my lab
I can see it can you see it I can see it
maybe I can save it with the edge of the
nose highlight mmm yeah I think I think
up a bit too much oh no no did you
select do not recommend do you know we
haven't used that
yeah the Peppa Pig I'm gonna use up a
lips okay okay I'm gonna lose my candy
cane
into a little pot of eyeliner try and
try you pull this off then you are the
best person at makeup I've ever nine
spoiler I won't okay I'm just gonna
mascara up my malteaser let's just cover
my poor teaser okay more teasers not the
best tool for makeup at all I was like
oh it might work I thought we were
actually not gonna do too badly with
this but um I was wrong
ha I going great no but that's so that's
better than I can do it you've got a saw
this one mine but it's a bit a bit how
are you doing your I do like cool
mascara malteaser like what are you
doing what are you doing I never thought
my life would come to this well am I
gonna do my mascara with oh it's the
same color as the chocolate so I can't
see what I'm putting on my eyes like
it's legit oh my gosh and it she is the
same color can imagine if I accidentally
went to eat this malteaser afterwards
never made it up just a quick trip to
uni amid yeah okay with this brow
mascara hmm I was gonna be number 13
that's so weird
okay so you're gonna go there's your 1
12 and lipstick to face melted in child
style okay i'm using the morphe liquid
lipstick in the shade morphe it's like
their signature red it's their signature
red color and let's just oh this feels
really weird like it just really creamy
yeah it's because the chocolate is like
melting into your lips my lips stinging
I'm joking that's starting to sting
we're gonna go with the fact that the
chocolate is all melted and bunched up
on my lips but delicious I look ready to
party
yours looks really Christmassy though
that's one way to describe yeah that's
that's the best part
I love is so nice like the best concert
I've ever done my eyebrows I'm just
shocked
although I'm kind of pleasantly
surprised at the nose highlight yes I
feel like that's the best highlight and
wather eyes actually think your eyebrows
