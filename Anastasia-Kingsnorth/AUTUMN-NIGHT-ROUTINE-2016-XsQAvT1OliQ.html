back with my autumn night routine for
2016 so I'm starting off my night
routine by unpacking in my bag this is
actually a brand new bag I got recently
from Primark and it was ten pounds and
I'm literally obsessed with it so in my
bag I just keep a load of random things
really
I have friends headphones H&amp;amp;M sunglasses
a little H&amp;amp;M pink bag with beauty things
in and my purse so once I finished
unpacking and sorting through my bag I
will just hang it up and sit and have
some downtime I don't tend to go on my
phone that much when I'm out as I don't
really like to use my 3G because I don't
have that much of it so I just much
prefer to do it on Wi-Fi so when I come
home I will scroll through my Instagram
my Twitter add things to my snapchat
story go on YouTube make sure you follow
me on all of our social medias because
you guys are so active on them at the
moment and so am i I usually love
following and interacting with you guys
so make sure you go and follow them all
of the info will be on the screen
definitely make sure to add my snapchat
because so much happens on my snapchat
behind the scenes like funny moment so
you guys would never get to see anywhere
else so make sure you go add my snapchat
again it will be on the screen once I've
been on my phone I tend to venture
towards Netflix because Netflix is like
my favorite thing ever so I just sit
there and watch some movies or watch
Pretty Little Liars or anything like
that and once I've had enough of diets
then time to start tidying up so today I
had to tidy up my makeup mess from
earlier this morning so just pops it
back into my makeup bag and tied it away
my makeup brushes as I'm not gonna lie I
had quite a bit of mess
it's then time for skincare so I do a
really really quick skincare routine
before my bath all I do is take the
Garnier micellar cleansing water and pop
it on a cotton pad and just wipe away
all of my makeup I do my eyes first then
my lips then my skin and I just use
gentle circular motions with the cotton
pads to get all my makeup off I then
write to pick some items for my bath so
today I picked out three different items
two of them were from the Weller's range
and then the other one was from the body
shop so the first is Easter well a
scooper do pearl I've got this one needs
a Weller apartment that I visited and I
love it it's coming out really soon and
then I used her fist bar and then I use
the body shop British Rose fresh
plumping mask this is my favorite face
mask I would 100% recommend it it's then
time for my bath when so I picked out
all of my products and I might prefer
having bath in autumn and then showers
in summer as I feel like faster a lot
more cozier in autumn so whilst I was in
the bath I just use two different
product I use the bath and Bodyworks
pink lemonade fizz shower gel and then
the soap and glory shower jelly in this
flavor clean on me and then for my face
I use the good things brands which I am
loving at the moment this charcoal face
scrub and face wash have literally saved
my skin
they're from the drugstore go and get
them this isn't sponsored they just sent
it to my PO Box and I'm genuinely in
love
and then of course what is an autumn
night routine without painting your
nails of course I don't do this every
night but I do do it most night if they
chip or if I just fancy a new color I
love bury em bury em is definitely my
favorite nail polish brand and then
probably nails ink and yeah I just
moisturize my hands with the Bath &amp;amp; Body
Works smart from a pumpkin latte cream
which by the way is insane and to finish
my night routine off I just got a cup
that says I stay sweet I think it says
and I just filled this with some water
and then I just watched some movies on
my laptop as I said I love Netflix and
YouTube never this is my favorite thing
ever
I love London has fallen Olympus has
fallen and white house down those are my
favorites so after that I will then head
to bed I really hope you enjoyed this
video if you did give it a huge thumbs
up let's smash 10,000 likes and I will
see you in next week's video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
