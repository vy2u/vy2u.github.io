in a bit of a different setting and I am
going to doing it my autumn night
routine for 2017 the reason I'm starting
a video like this is actually because I
have been day vlogging I'm doing this on
my canon g7x I'm absolutely loving it
day vlogging and I would love you guys
to go over to my daily vlogging channel
and check it out like I said there's a
new vlog every single day at 6 p.m. and
link will be down below please go watch
because it's like 125,000 of you over
there now which is crazy
I'd love to grow the family even more so
if you do want to see a bit more what I
do in my everyday life then you should
go definitely check out my daily vlogs
but like I said today I am going to be
doing a autumn night routine at now
night routine videos are my absolute
favorite to film especially in autumn or
fall whatever you like to call it this
season is my absolute favorite and as
you can tell I've got a bit of an
automata background coming on but which
you guys will see in upcoming videos I
also do have a new video schedule when
I'll be uploading at more videos a week
which I will leave a link to the video
explaining that on screen now and in the
description so you guys can see the yeah
I'm very very very excited for this
video autumn routines are my favorite
and I have loved filming this it was
such a cozy just cute night and I just
love it even got my candle burning here
it sounds so good but yeah I really hope
you guys enjoy it and let's get straight
on into the video
so my day or shall I say in my evening
will probably start off on me walking
home from somewhere today I'd actually
been to Starbucks and just decided to go
out for a walk and get some work done so
I just got a hot chocolate and then on
my way home I drank it as soon as I got
home I lit my candle is it too early to
like Christmas candles most probably but
I did it anyway because it smells so
good and one of the first things they
always do is sort up my bag from that
day they tend to have a load of kind of
random receipts and just loose change
and stuff so I organize all my bag and
then I would get straight on in it to
blogging because yes I've seen it so
many times by dude a blog now so I
always update everybody as soon as I get
home then it's that time where I check
all of my social medias I do this and
every single routine because this is
what I tend to do every single night so
all I will do is sit on my laptop and I
will first of all go through Twitter
because Twitter is actually one of my
favorite social medias probably will go
actually I don't know which one's my
favorite but I am addicted to Twitter so
you guys should definitely go follow my
Twitter I tweet so many times every day
and I was just checking up on my feed
and going through and liking your guys's
tweets as I always like to keep you guys
updated on Twitter and follow you back
then it is time to check Instagram and
again I'm absolutely addicted to
Instagram we're getting so close to
300,000 followers on there so you guys
definitely go drop me a follow over on
there as well
I post a picture nearly every single day
I'm that addicted to it and they're
always like all of your guys's comments
because I'm so so thankful for all your
support then finally I will check
snapchat and I always keep you guys
updated on snapchat our family is
growing it's so much on there so if you
do want to add me I will leave my name
on screen but yeah always keeping you
guys updated with what I'm doing on
snapchat and once I've updated all my
social medias then it is time to get to
work and I don't know if you guys know
I'm actually doing online a level so I
will just do all of my work that I need
to do for that day if that's one of the
days that I'm working and also keep
updated with YouTube's work and
everything like that
and then I will take another photo
snapshot just so you guys know I'm still
here and I'm still alive and then I'll
pick out some products for my bath in
the evening and I've been obsessing over
the body shots and in a pumpkin arrange
at the moment it smells so so good and
then once I've picked out all of my bath
products it is time to do my skincare so
the first thing I would do is remove my
makeup tonight I really didn't feel like
going all in so I just removed it was a
makeup wipe it's very quick it's very
easy and I don't do this every night I
do normally use at my selfie skin face
wash but tonight as I was doing a kind
of laid back pamper evening I decided to
use a face wipe and then I just popped a
no strip on it to remove all the dirt
and the clogged up paws I then applied
at my selfie skin step number three
which is the moisturizer this has
obviously clear my skin up so much and
it is so so moisturizing I love it so
much and it would 100% recommend this
so as you guys know ever since my school
morning routine went up I have been
using it the selfie skin is sixty day
treatment this is the number C which is
the night cream so obviously as it is an
autumn night routine I have been using
this in the evening but honestly I hope
you guys can see my skin has cleared up
so much I have loved this treatment so
much because my skin was very red
it was very irritated it was very
sensitive and I had to be really careful
with what I put on it but ever since
using this a three-step selfie skin it's
gotten us so much better my skin feels
smoother which is really nice and my
pores own that's as visible and of
course I still get the odd random spot
but that's just because I'm hormonal I'm
a teenager but this overall has cleared
my skin up so well I would 100%
recommend it if you guys do you wanna
get it I will leave a link down below in
description box so make sure to go pick
it up I will leave a link but yeah
honestly 100% recommend it I can't get
enough it is then time for me to get a
bath so first I just light some candles
as what isn't alter my routine without a
crap ton of candles so I just lit a lot
of candles and I absolutely love having
baths so then I just put some bubble
bath in as I actually had no lush at the
moment which is not like me at all I'm
just waiting for all the new Christmas
stuff which is actually out now and then
I use my smoothie style breakfast scrub
which is from soap &amp;amp; Glory I love this
stuff as well it's so so good
Adams Adams spray tanned at the moment
as well it's just keeping it intact and
then I wash my body with the body shops
at Pinilla pumpkin shower gel like I
said earlier this smells heavenly I'm
actually addicted to it and I'm
definitely gonna be using this all the
way through autumn and winter then I
went in with my body chocolate vanilla
pumpkin a body cream just a top-up on
the vanilla pumpkin scent not that it
needed it because it's so so strong but
it's literally incredible and it's
really reasonably priced as well so I'll
leave a link down below if you guys
wanna buy it but it's so good and then
I'll actually spend some time with my
little brother me and him just like to
watch some YouTube videos as he
literally loves YouTube and it's so cute
always pretend to vlog around the house
dinner looks so good and if you guys
want to see more of the dinner site then
you should definitely check out my day
vlogs and I haven't ever said that but
like you saw a promo but how good does
this look
I've got Frogg Lee roasting her first in
her meeting post pizza he throws steak
and mushrooms in peppercorn sauce so so
good finally my favorite part of the
night is getting into bed and snuggling
up all cozy so then I just take to
Netflix and just look into my heart's
content
finally like I want to watch Netflix are
always adding new things and I'll just
check my social medias again literally
until I fall asleep and that is how I
spend the majority of my autumn nights
so that is the end of this video I
really hope you enjoyed it if you did
remember to give it a huge thumbs up
comment down below your favorite thing
