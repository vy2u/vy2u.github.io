going to be doing a huge beauty and
fashion haul for autumn so I film this
video three times now and I have said
beauty and fashion autumn haul every
time and I need to say autumn beauty and
fashion haul and I don't know why I
cannot get the words out of my mouth but
today are you doing a huge haul and it's
going to include some wintery autumn
fashion bits and then a ton of beauty
bits that you could possibly pick up
during the autumn time and I thought
this would be a really good video to
kind of put up as the start of my autumn
series I den a DIY autumn spun out which
I'll link down below by following qahal
is always a good video to start with
also every different background say
because my background wasn't loving me
so I'm in my mum's room so sort of it is
also a bit echoey but without further
ado let's get into the video so the
first shop I went into uhm now I always
knew about H&amp;amp;M but I never really went
in there and specifically looked for
items and specifically looked around for
a lot of clothes because I always kind
of drifted more towards new look but the
other day I went in there and I was like
you know what they have some really nice
clothes so the first thing I picked up
was a pair of trousers and they are
these petrol blue tight skinny 15
trailers now I'm not going to show you
them I'm going to overlay clip because
it's just a lot easier and you can see
the full product but they were only
$7.99 and they're a bit like skinny
jeans but they're just a lot nicer
material and they had just have a zip up
the side there's no button or anything
so that really goes with every type of
top and jumper which I really liked
and they did them in a ton of colors I
think they did me mustard burgundy
petrol blue black I got the black and
khaki green but no I've got the petrol
blue but I want the black because they
didn't have the black but I know they do
it but I got the petrol blue and I
absolutely love them and I'm gonna get
so much wear out of them in the autumn
time I then picked up this knitted
jumper now I saw this on somebody's
Instagram and they were like it's $7.99
I was like what $7.99 for a jumper like
that's so cheap for a jumper so I'm only
teaching them and it is basically a
and dark-gray knitted jumper and it is
not like her kind of like a tacky shiny
flux which you kind of get from cheaper
shops it's a really really good quality
fluff you probably know what I'm on
about maybe maybe not but I hope you do
because it looks a lot more expensive
than it was the $7.99 it is insane and I
absolutely love it it's so so comfy and
to keeps me so warm as well which is the
main part of a jumper so I would
definitely recommend going to pick some
of those up because how gee I then went
into new look now new look as I said is
my go to shop but at the moment there's
just not a lot in there that I've been
100% loving like I wouldn't go in there
and be able to spend a lot of money
because it's not a lot of things that I
like but I actually saw something that
I've really liked so I had to get it and
it was a sleeveless blazer no I'd like
one of these for a long time but I just
never knew what color to get so instead
of going for the classic white or black
one I decided to go for this kind of
like speckled grain black one and it
just has the collar down here and it's
really long it's a long line one and it
just has slits up the side and it is so
comfy and actually said on the label of
warm coat as well and I 100% agree
because it was so warm and just so fuzzy
and I absolutely loved it so I picked
that up $17.99 which I thought was
really good for a sneakers blazer of
that quality and then to go under it I
just got this plain black top from
Primark for one pound 80 which is really
comfy and really nice to film in so that
is all the clothing items I picked up I
didn't really pick up a ton of clothing
items because I'm a lot more bigger on
beauty than I am clothing so now I'm
going to show you all of the clothing
items I got so I just found them all
down here oh and this huge left bag and
it's so so big so let's just get started
so this is gonna be really weird to say
but I'm actually going to show you some
Bath &amp;amp; Body Works stuff so my friend
Ella this is also a collab video with
her I will link her video
we did a SWOT box and she went to
America and got my thing to America she
didn't just go there to get my things
she actually went on holiday and she got
me to Bath and Body Works stuff which I
was so grateful for because obviously we
can't buy it for very cheap anyway here
we can only really get it off of one
online shop patrolling down below but
the first thing she got me was a pink
lemonade fizz shower gel and I
absolutely loved it she got me all of
like the things that relate to pink and
all the things pretty so thank you so
much oh my god it just smells amazing
I love the cute little but I love it as
well it has a story know that surround
spray I think raspberry and lemon and a
little flower and I was absolutely love
this and I love the gold lids as well so
thank you so much she then got me
the sweet pea shear and vitamin E body
lotion and this is also from Bath and
Body Works and I've always heard of the
sweet pea scent because it's very very
popular and I absolutely love this I
thought it was leaking out the side but
it's not and oh my god I've only used it
once but it's so moisturizing and I
absolutely love it and I can't believe
I'm actually holding it for Bath &amp;amp; Body
Works because I want them to be in
England so bad it just smells so nice
and so refreshing and this is gonna be
perfect for autumn and finally for those
type of things she got me a new Bath and
Body Works Japanese cherry blossom
gentle foaming hand soap I'm gonna put
this in the bathroom because all of my
family love these and it smells so good
oh my god it smells amazing it has
disease little blots and pictures on and
I just absolutely love it I love the
shape of the bottle I think it's very
odd I really like it and I'm not sure
how many of these are but I cannot thank
you enough like literally it means a
world to me that you got me so thank you
and then the bath and Bodyworks fun does
not stop there guys because she got me
pocket backs and you can imagine my face
and I open the box and I don't route to
pocket back I guess so I'm going to show
you the one in the holder that I have
first
so this one is raspberry pink peony and
she also got me this little holder with
it so you just attach it to your bag
like that
and this one smells so good you can't
actually see the color of it but it's
pink and smells like Leone's I love this
you name got me three others and these
are
the new shape as well so I freaked out
she got me the pretty in pink one which
is pink with glittering she got me the
ripe raspberry wine which is red with
Burton beads in and then she got me the
Crisp apples with pink and bursting
beads in again and i love these all so
much literally I'm so so grateful and
you'll be seeing these future in a lot
of my videos and mainly I might even get
some to give away so that was all about
the body work stuff she got me - thank
you so much for all of that I love it
now I'm going to move on to Baby Lips
because I have to have four Baby Lips
items to show you and I love baby lips I
have a proven collection of them because
they're my favorite lip balm and
everybody connects something can I guess
I collect baby lips so the first two
ones I have are the Baby Lips winter
delight limited editions and then just
look like this they are the Baby Lips
in sugar cookie and then the sweet Apple
one now I got these from super drug I
think I'm gonna say three to four weeks
ago now and I haven't seen them since
like anywhere but I'm gonna see if I may
link them down below because they're
amazing they were buy one get one half
price and I actually saw them in a
really small super drug and I haven't
seen them in a big one so it was really
odd I haven't opened them yet but this
one's pink and then that one just red
and I love these so so so much I can
smell them through the little hole in
the back and I cannot wait to try these
so pretty excited about these and then
Ella actually also got me in our swap
box - Baby Lips moisturizing lip glosses
and these are impossible to find in the
UK until they hopefully bring them out
over here so she got me - so she got me
a number 25 type with me and number 48
tickled pink and I actually really like
the type with me while I thought this is
going to be really Ottoman all and this
one I can wear in the springy timer it's
a bit warmer and I would absolutely love
these so so much and I cannot wait the
wait to put these in my Alex yours to
add to my Baby Lips collection because
these make me happy
so I'm now going to show you something
else I got from the drugstore so I've
got the so added Beauty lets Pritts
fragrance to body sprays so my mum
actually tracked me to this she came
home and surprised me with it with this
and an arrow bar and this smells
incredible
only eight pound do I think it's amazing
for a perfume this size like the bottle
is amazing quality and then it just has
this gorgeous lace pattern at the back
with its gorgeous blue lid and I just
love it so so so much so thank you so
much mom and never forgetting me this I
just I love it I then just have a
high-end piece of makeup to show you so
I'm going to be submitted recently and I
picked up the Mac casual color lip and
cheek color that is what it's called I
don't know it may be sent misprint but I
got mine in shade lazy Sunday and it was
knocked down from 18 pound to 12 pounds
75 there wasn't loads of Mac there so
this is kind of just the only thing I
got but it just looks like this it's a
pastel pink one and I've used it once
it's actually really really good
I've never seen these before but I've
very chat with my purchase there because
it was a lot cheaper I think six pound
cheaper after a 12 pack or 12 pounds 75
so it smells really good as well and now
that is a plane please hurry up and move
okay so there's a plane in the back row
right now and it is not gonna move and I
can't think okay it's gone so now I'm
going to move on to March because who
doesn't love a bit of love so I first of
all got the comforter bubble bath slice
and I've never had a full size of the
comforter so can we just stop a minute
and just pray why be praying I don't
know but it is so so good I feel like
they've changed and sent a little bit
maybe it doesn't smell as sweet as it
used to but this is huge and I'm gonna
get so many baths out of this it was 4
pounds 75 but 4 pounds 75
I think that's hundreds net worth the
money so I got that one I then picked up
the what is called the golden handshake
now this is actually a hand mask and you
just swish it around I'm just gonna do
what you have to do swish it around in
the sink and you pop your hands in and
it will give you a really nice massage
the waters at Mossad you things make
your hand soft but yeah this is amazing
and it was only 395 and the final thing
I thought was creamy candy
it just looks like this and I actually
lost a flower on it last night when I
was having a look at what I got but it
was a white flower and this is amazing
I'm going to be using this and for these
upcoming videos like routines and stuff
because creamy candy is one of my
favorite bubble bars as well because it
makes the water go pink so that is the
end of my autumn beauty and fashion haul
I really hope you enjoyed it I just have
a really quick announcement to say at
the end so I mentioned in a few videos
