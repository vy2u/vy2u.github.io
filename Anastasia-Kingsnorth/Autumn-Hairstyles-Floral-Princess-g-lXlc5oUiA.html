quite saying my name everyone today's
video is going to be a awesome
hairstyles video and a sort of haircare
routine so a haircare routine and kind
of hairstyles been requested but I
really wanted to do a hairstyle video on
my channel as I've recently been wearing
loads of different hairstyles that I've
been so so happy with so I really wanted
to share them with you I'm just gonna
start off this video by kind of showing
the products I use on my hair and what I
do to my hair before I do any of these
hairstyles first thing I would do is
wash my hair with a shampoo and
conditioner so I wash my hair every
other day so just wash it one day leave
it a day and then wash it so I use the
Alberto Bauer Sam Sunkist or as Bree
shampoo and conditioner so I really like
the shampoo and conditioner because I
just kind of think it really makes my
hair feel soft and it doesn't like
grease really quickly it greases up
after like 3 or 4 days and I never leave
it that long to wash anyway and this is
only a pound of bottles so seriously
cheap and I absolutely love it i also
did use the l'oreal shampoo and
conditioner but that started to give me
matte so i just stuck to this one on
days where I am not washing my hair or I
could just kind of see a little greasy
patch I will just use a dry shampoo so I
like to use the batiste floral and
flirty blush dry shampoo and you just
kind of spray this on your hair and
scruff it in and it's just really nice
and this can was a pound from Superdrug
so really inexpensive and it's a really
good product other thing I absolutely
love in my hair care routine is my
hairbrush so I've actually ordered a new
tangle teezer
I've ordered a pastel purple one but it
hasn't came yet so I'm just gonna have
to show this one so this is a orange
orange when I get out from purple and
pink tangle teezer
and it's just the handheld one it's not
the pocket size with the lid and I
really like this I got this one for
Christmas but it's kind of just going a
bit dodgy now and the ends have gone
really white which means you kind of
need to get any hair brush so I ordered
one but this is an
amazing hairbrush and it will get
anything called your hair so now I've
shown you all of the different things I
like to do to my hair I will show you
quite a few different autumn hairstyles
the first tutorial is a plaited headband
so I'm just gonna start off by brushing
my hair and then taking a under piece
from the bottom layer of my hair and I'm
just gonna Stanley plat it all the way
down to the bottom once I've flutters it
all the way down to the bottom I'm just
gonna lift it behind my head and then
bobby pin it to the back of my head and
do exactly the same to the other side
and Jacana just looks like you have a
headband around your head but it's just
made out of hair and I think it looks
really pretty and a lot nicer than a
normal headband you can also leave your
hair down with just some mini plaques in
it and this kind of bohemian and I love
to wear this to a festival
the next one is a half-up half-down so
again I'm just gonna start off by
brushing my hair then I split my parting
into two parts one side with more hair
on and then I just loosely pinned it up
and it's exactly the same to the other
side so one hair had more hair than the
other if you make sense and that is just
a really easy and quick one
this braid is a really eye-catching one
and it's an all around the head braid so
I'm just gonna start off by French
braiding and waterfall braiding and my
hair so you're just normal plat it and
then every strand you pick up a new
piece of hair with it and you know I
just plaited all the way down to the
bottom until I literally got as much
hair as I could in it when I'd finish
the play I bought the platter on the
back of my head and plaited it into
three big strands so I basically just
done another plat down the side and I
just put it in with it and I really like
how this turned out the next hairstyle
is a really really quick one so I just
started off by bobby pin in my fringe
back and then I just loosely plaited my
hair and I didn't want this to be
perfect I wanted it to be really messy
so once I'd like tied it at the bottom I
just like really messed it up and made
it all loose and this is how I love to
wear my hair to school I think it looks
so nice and looks effortless so if you
want to make a braid look a little bit
more interesting you can braid one part
of the plat so I've split my hair into
three parts and then braided one part
bobby pinned it at the bottom and I just
use a bobby pin and then I just tied it
off at the end and I took the bobby pin
out and you had a messy effortless plat
which looks like you put so much effort
into it
the milkmaid braid is good for a really
heavy rainy day or windy day because
your hair is at your face so I started
off by putting my hair into two sections
and braiding each of the sections and
then I just tied them off at the bottom
with a clear elastic band I then picked
the bottom of each section and I just
basically put it over my head and then I
clipped it in place and this looks so
effortless again and perfect for a windy
day the next hairstyle is personally one
of my favorite so it's just kind of a
half up ponytail you just basically take
the top layer of your hair and put it in
a like ponytail and mess it up and I
really like this look I would definitely
wear this to a festival with some plats
in like zoella did my final hair look
Cassidy my favorite and most worn around
the autumn time so far so I just started
off by putting my hair into a high
ponytail and then I just basically
twisted my hair around and I twisted it
around the hair bubble and then I just
got another hair bubble and push the bun
down and put the hair bubble over it and
once I had tied the hair bubble over
three times I just screwed all the hair
up and made it look really messy and I
loved how it turned out I hope you
enjoyed this video and I will see you in
my next video bye
