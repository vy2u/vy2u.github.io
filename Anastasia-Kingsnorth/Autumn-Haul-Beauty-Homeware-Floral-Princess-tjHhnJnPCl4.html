going to be doing an autumn beauty and
homeware haul
the Soraa thought I was gonna say
something else then and then I kinda
just went blank and I ended up saying
homework but I did mean to say homework
so I were doing a homework beauty haul
today and it's going to be an autumn
themed one so I'm really excited for it
as I've picked up some really nice or to
me things recently and yeah I'm just
really excited for this haul also I'm in
a bit of a different background so I
really hope you enjoy it and like it but
I am boiling because my studio lights
are just beaming on my face so yes so
everyone up a bit sweaty but yeah I'm
just gonna get straight into the video
and start up with my home where things
but before I show you the things I have
I just wanted to ask if you guys wanted
to see a three in one type of video
within room tour a DIY organization and
a homework haul all in one because I
really want to do a video you like
revolving my room so if you do want to
see that leave a like on this video it
also I'll leave a comment down below and
your thumbs up that comment as well and
then I can see if you guys want to see
that so yeah I'm just going to show you
what I got for this video so the first
thing I picked up was this gorgeous
little copper basket from Tiger which
would just hit my face with but absent
Wow I keep doing that I just absolutely
love this it's like a rose gold II
copper and just a rectangular basket and
I think this is so pretty
I am only three pounds from Tiger as
well which is like so cheap three pounds
of copper basket I've been looking for
one of these for like ages I absolutely
love this so I'm very very tough I got
that I then got one of the things I
wanted for the longest time and it is a
geometric terrarium I have one of one of
these for so so long and I'm so happy
that I finally got one I got it from new
look and it was six pounds and to be
honest knew that was the last place I
ever thought I would have got one so
going to new look if you're looking for
one of these because if the cheapest
place I found them and I absolutely love
them I've got the last copper one as all
of the others were kind of gold in a way
but I definitely wanted copper so yeah
I'm really happy with it and I love it
and the last home weary thing I'm going
to show you in this video is my little
hexagon pot from H&amp;amp;M home so I recently
placed an order on H&amp;amp;M home because they
have the most amazing copper home where
just like a lot of places do I find the
best places are H&amp;amp;M home new look and
Tiger for it and one of the things I got
was this gorgeous little hex in pics
they're hexagonal pop I think this is so
lovely and it was only four pounds it
did come with a lid but I have the lid
is on my shelf up there hello to
absolutely love this and I think it's so
so pretty I have no idea what I'm going
to keep in it but I'm sure I'll find
something for it because it's just so
pretty so now I'm gonna move on to all
of my like beauty bits from the
drugstore then a bit of high-end and
then some lush which God I'm excited
about so the first thing I got from the
drugstore was a repurchase and it was a
different nail polish basically my
friend and me a few years ago got me a
pack of nail polishes my birthday from
Essie and and it came as like a brown
and a red and I used the red so much
didn't run out so I have to go buy
another one and it is this gorgeous
shade called Bahama Mama I have it on my
nails now and it flies on my nails and
paint my nails so so lovely and it is
just like the nicest consistency to put
on your nails like I normally love Barry
I've no varnishes but I really like like
whipping this all out in the autumn
because I've got enough Burgundy I was
gonna say mahogany but for some reason I
don't actually know what color my
hopping is I do but I've just gone blank
so yeah but I absolutely love this and
it was eight pounds but I think it's
definitely worth the money I've just
realized that it's the only drugstore
thing I have I know I don't I have one
more thing I have say from soap &amp;amp; Glory
so I'm saving Dori I have the brand new
sunroof body sprays and this one isn't
smoothie start keep it in myself in the
face with all this stuff I swear I
mention the black and blue by the end of
this video so I just got this gorgeous
smoothie so body spray and it is amazing
I absolutely love this it is just oh my
god literally all of my segments Dori
stuff it's off this scent because I love
it so much and it was only four pounds
so when I saw they had it in the body
spray I was like it's going straight in
my basket funny story
mm um um actually went round Tesco and
did that straight in my basket joke and
it was absolutely hilarious I will
probably film it one day to be honest
because it really did make my day doing
that the next thing I have is something
again I've wanted for ages and it is the
Maybelline
blush news palette so I recently took to
eBay and found that they've sold bits
palette on there from a seller and I was
just over the flippin moon
like literally I wanted this palette for
so long so I'm so so happy that I got it
and it's just this gorgeous array of
Pink's like something with faint when I
look at it it's just stunning and I
absolutely love this the pigmentation is
really high as well which is rare for
drugstore palettes so it was 14 pounds
and I will link it down below if it's
still up but if it's not I actually
bought another one for a giveaway soon
because we're getting closer to 100 K
which is oh I'm really hyper in
this video I really hope you don't mind
that because it's like six look at night
on a Saturday night I'm still not
filming my video what I am now I wasn't
and yeah it's getting dark outside so
bit hyper the next thing I got was a
high-end item and it is my very first
nails I turn on the mum bought me this
is gonna give me my pocket money because
I wanted it so bad so she got me it and
I absolutely love it and it is my NARS
orgasm blush the only bad thing about
nice products are the names but you know
we can get over that we're all mature
here we can get it but I just absolutely
love this and it's so so pretty just
this gorgeous pastel pink shade and I
love it oh my god it was 23 pounds but
they're definitely worth the money
because of how they're packaged as well
like the quality of the packaging is
incredible and I wouldn't I'm definitely
gonna get more nice products because
this is my first ever one but this is my
first one of hopefully many now I'm
gonna move on it to one of my favorite
parts which is the lush so the first
thing I'm going to show you is actually
leaked up slightly annoyed about but it
is basically these Santa's belly shower
jelly now I went into that early today
and I picked this up and it's just this
really pretty red shower jelly and it
kind of goes everywhere but we can get
over that as well
it's just so so lovely and it has these
gorgeous like pinky hearts in and stars
a really feel soft touch can you see
this I'm just like stroking it it's so
so no flims gonna get it out you know
I'll wipe my hands on my bed cover
because I'm gonna put them straight into
watch after this sorry that's so
disgusting
looks like this and it's just all red
and slimy and I love it and it's smell
was like I don't even know what it
smells like what does it say it smells
like it doesn't but it's really really
nice and I love this so much and it was
only four pounds as well which I thought
was really reasonable for that so picked
up that from lush don't wipe my hands on
our seat fill like that some more mature
options ago school everyday the next
thing I got was so from their Christmas
range and it is there is it called the
magic of Christmas bubble bar so I get
this every year but they've changed the
name this year and it's so so lovely
it's a pastel pink star with a little
bow and a ribbon that's the same thing I
meant a bow and it's just on the stick
and you can just swish it around and it
will turn your bath or pink and bubbly
which is why I love this and oh my god
this is just so lovely and I cannot wait
to use it in my bath this is 5 pounds 25
I believe but I do normally get about 15
baths out of it so it's definitely more
worth in the long run the next product I
got is one of my absolute favorite it is
the lush sparkly pumpkin this is one of
my all-time favorites from lush in the
autumnal range and I hope they bring it
back every single year it just smells
like really ought to me really like
musky which I really like and it was
only 3 pound 65 and again I've got about
5 uses out of each bubble bar so that is
so good the final thing I picked up with
one of the brand new things and it is
the razzle dazzle bath oil now even
though it says oil it looks like this
it's like a re moldable very easy to
melt little blob of color and what you
do is you just cut a little bit off and
just pop it in your bath and it makes
the water feel quite thick and really
nice so the woman was explain it to me
but explaining it to me in the North
Hampton lush and it's an amazing city
only 2 pounds so I had to pick that up
and I cannot wait to use that so that is
the end of my haul I really hope you
enjoyed it
also bit of a different background today
it was bit more further back which I
quite liked and also I have my hair up
which is a bit different but I like
different so we're going to go for the
dip
look but never know if you like this
video for giving it a huge thumbs up and
I will see you in my next video
oh my god by the way we're really close
to 100k I just said that but we won't
even be at 100k on my next video so not
be a lot and I'll see you soon bye that
kiss
literally tasted like lush oh my god</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
