going to be doing and ultimate get ready
with me I wanted to film it obviously
get ready with me for so long and
finally I thought I would film it today
for you as I know you guys have been
requesting a Ottoman or drugstore makeup
so that is exactly what I've done today
but as well as showing you how I had my
hair and an autumn outfit that I've
recently been loving so I am pre filming
this that I don't know if I've had a
hundred K yet but if I have I'm gonna
leave a huge thing in the description
box and a huge thing in the comment box
as well because I don't know what I'm
uploading this but if I do have a
hundred K at this point I just want to
say thank you so much because I'm
already crying
I need it under K so honestly guys thank
you so so much that means the world to
me and I'm not full so without further
ado I'm going to get in today's video
and you can find out how to get this
makeup look loose hair and my outfit
so to begin my autumn drugstore makeup
look I decided to go with the Maybelline
instant anti age primer I don't use this
for anti age are you tease because it is
genuinely the most amazing primer I then
decided to go in with a foundation and
instead of my True Match I wanted to use
the infallible 24 hour matte so for me
this isn't exactly mattifying but it is
a really good coverage foundation I have
the lighter shade and I genuinely do
love this so I would definitely
recommend this for a drugstore
foundation for concealer I could go with
none other than my classic collection mm
lasting perfection because this is
genuinely the most perfect concealer for
my skin and I'll just pop this under my
eyes and blend that again with my Real
Techniques expert face brush for powder
I decided to set my face with the
Maybelline fit me and this is incredible
I this is definitely my favorite
drugstore powder as it adds a lot of
coverage as well as mattifying all of my
makeup and lasting all day so on top of
that I will then go in with my blush and
I will use his sleek rose gold blush
purely for the fact that this is an
exact troop of my brand Newton arse
orgasm I love this blush so much and is
definitely a cheaper alternative for
NARS to add a bit more of a color back
in my face I decided to go with the
sleek contour kit and I just use the
highlighter on my cheekbones and on my
Cupid's bow I would sometimes but it on
my nose but it kind of makes you look or
you leave so I just skipped that step
today and then I decided to move on to
my eyes so I decided to use the Revlon
22 eyes shadow palette because I
literally love this so I just use the
pastel pink shade all over my lid and
then top that off with a coppery brown
shade to set it I didn't want to go very
complicated today I felt like going very
natural and finally I just popped a
little bit of white in my inner corner
and that completed my very simple eye
look of course you cannot forget about
mascara because I really feel like this
opens up my eyes so I just went with the
collection no clumps as this is very
natural-looking yet really does open my
eyes up and makes my lashes at very long
and black and finally to complete the
whole makeup look I went in with my
Rimmel Kate Moss lipstick in number 30
which I definitely prefer over 107
because it's more of a berry
shade and I just pop this on my lips
I then that just unclipped my hair as I
just clipped it back faceted my makeup
and I just let my fringe down and messed
it up a little bit because I'd
previously curled it earlier on that
morning and yeah these were just kind of
a few hours after curls so they weren't
it's actually perfect but yeah that's
what I did for my hair that day so my
outfit is just oh my god I'm literally
obsessing over this so my jeans are
Joanie jeans from Topshop and they were
36 pounds and then my boots art boots
from new look and they were 25 pounds
and they're just these gray Chelsea
boots which are block healed and finally
my shirt is from new look it was $17.99
and I literally adore it I'm going to be
wearing this so much and especially in
videos because the collar is just
beautiful and yeah can we just give this
video a thumbs up because how beautiful
is the setting in this oh my god so I
hope you enjoyed that video let me know
if you did by giving it a huge thumbs up
and let's see if we can smash 5,000
likes because we've been doing that
recently and I definitely know you can
do that again because 100k guys let's do
it I love you all so much and I will see
you in next week's video bye
who's in the cracks of the landslide</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
