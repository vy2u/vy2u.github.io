going to be doing a kind of autumn
inspiration video gonna be since DIYs
and snacks some things to do and just
everything like that and I'm not gonna
lie I'm so excited for this video so I'm
in a park right now that is why there's
probably a fat ground noise but at the
moment it's just Birds
so it's really really nice and kind of
like calming so this video is a collab
with two amazing girls the first that is
my best friend amber who is doing a DIY
autumn snacks video and she is here with
me today right now and the other one is
Maddie from Mesa leonine who does
amazing DIY videos and routine videos
and her videos are just amazing so
subscribed her and get her to 200,000 so
I hope you enjoyed the video staying to
the end for a little giveaway and I will
see you soon so for the first DIY I'm
going to be showing you how to make a
caramel yo s lip bar so you will need a
brand new EOS lip balm of flavor of your
choice a butter knife a packet of hot
chocolate some caramel sauce or caramel
syrup and a spoon so the first thing you
want to do is unscrew your EOS lid and
you just want to cut the lip balm off
I'm not thinking cut it off yes you've
got to cut the whole lip balm off and
then just scoop up the rest of the lip
balm from the grate there will be quite
a lot stuck in the gray prepare that I
don't know why but it's just like that
with every EOS lip balm so once it is
all out there great you just want to pop
it the gray out and then again take away
the excess lip balm
once you have done that you just want to
screw Italy great back in but to the lid
instead of the bottom part and you just
want to start mashing up the lip bar and
then pop it in the microwave for around
30 seconds it will melt down completely
to a consistency like this and you just
want to add your caramel sauce and mix
that around as well if it goes lumpy
just pop it in the microwave again for
another 30 seconds and it should appear
like this you then just want to pour it
back into the EOS lid and sprinkle a bit
of hot chocolate on top and pop it in
the fridge for around three to four
hours when you take it out the fridge it
will look disgusting underneath but you
just want to pop it back on to the
bottom and unscrew it and you have a
perfect new EOS lip-balm so mine didn't
fill the whole container it was a little
smaller and the caramel settled all
around the edge which was a bit not what
I really wanted but you know what he
still turned out pretty good and I was
so so happy with the result so now I
thought I would show you my outfit I
just went really simple and all to me so
I just bought a plain black top from
Primark and a pair of plain black
leggings from new look and then I just
wore some grey new look boots with my
grey and UNIX blazer all featured in my
previous haul and I just wore this red
lipstick and had my hair curly and yet I
felt really ought to me now for my other
DIY which is a DIY bath and Bodyworks
handle so you will need a bath and
Bodyworks candle label a wick or three
wicks some glue I just use print stick
some fragrance oil and wine was vanilla
as like a circular glass jar and a block
handle so the first thing you want to do
is grab a block candle and you want to
chop it up now this was really hard so I
would definitely recommend getting
candle shavings or melting it in the
microwave a bit before you cut it
because this took me absolutely ages so
what I've done it was in pieces like
this and they were pretty big because it
was just so hard to cut down to smaller
sizes so I just pop that in the
microwave and while that was in the
microwave for five minutes I just glued
my wick down in the middle of
ja this took a while to stick again but
eventually it did stick so then I just
called all of my candle oil back into
the jar and then I just added my
fragrant oil which with vanilla and I
just let that set for a few hours it was
set in about two hours I then just cut
the wick off and I got my glue stick
again and glued the Bath &amp;amp; Body Works
candle label on top of the candle and
this is such a cheaper way and making
the candle literally they were exactly
like Bath &amp;amp; Body Works candles and for
us people in England who can't get them
it's just so good
finally I thought I would show you some
things to do and some essentials so me
and amber actually had a picnic in the
park if you want to go find out how to
make all of those amazing snacks head
over to Amber's channel because she did
all of these and they were so so good we
could definitely go have a picnic in the
park and finally for my essentials the
first one is this laurio lipstick in
JLo's nude is such a gorgeous nude for
the autumn time and I love it
the next lipstick is Rimmel Kate Moss in
number 30 this is a dark berry red and
it's so so pretty for the autumn time as
well I have it on in this video
my next essential is the Too Faced
better than sex mascara this mascara is
going to be my number one autumn mascara
and I just love it so so much
and my final essential is the sleek
contour click in light the highlight in
this is stunning and it is perfect
so that is the end of the video so now
