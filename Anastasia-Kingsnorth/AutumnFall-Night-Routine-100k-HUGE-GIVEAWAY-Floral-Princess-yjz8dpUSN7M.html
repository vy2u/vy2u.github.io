going to doing my autumn night routine
so this video it was so requested and
I've really was in the mood to film a
night routine today so I was like you
know what I'm gonna do it but I also
thought that I would include my a
hundred thousand subscriber giveaway in
this video as well so it's staying to
the end if you want to find out how you
can enter the giveaway honestly I cannot
thank you enough for a hundred thousand
subscribers that literally means the
world to me that we actually done it
like all together and oh my god I'm just
really really happy so yeah wait until
the end if you want to see what you can
win and how to enter and everything but
for now I hope you enjoy the video so
the first thing I will do on my autumn
night routine is unpack my bag and I
will only do this if I have been out for
the day and today I actually had been so
I just unpacked my bag and then put that
back in my wardrobe and as I've been out
I then just sat down and decided to go
on my phone as I hadn't really been on
social media that much so I just go
through Instagram and Twitter I've been
so much more active on Twitter
especially recently so I'll leave my
Instagram and Twitter down below so you
can go and follow me if you wish I will
then just sit down on my laptop once I
finished on my phone and catch up on a
few YouTube videos so I decided to watch
Alecia Murray's vlogs as I'm obsessed
with them recently and I think she's an
amazing vlogger so definitely go check
her out if you haven't already
I have also finally sorted out my
snapchats if you do want to go add me
you can either scan my barcode which is
on the screen or add me my link will be
in the description or on the screen as
well I'm so much more active on snapchat
I love adding things to my story now so
if you guys have watched my videos for a
while you know that I can't really have
like a relaxing evening without making
sure my room is cleaned so I would just
clean over my room just like wipe them
over with some cleaning wipes all over
my shelves and my dressing table and
everything like that and I will also
make my bed because oh my god I
literally cannot go on with my night and
that's my room is clean it just it's not
me
and then once I've done that I will just
grab some candles and just put them on
my dressing table and light them all as
this makes my room for really cozy and
very ready for my night
by this time I'm normally getting pretty
hungry and thirsty so I would normally
have my dinner but this night I didn't
actually have it until much later so I
decided to get a hot chocolate and then
I just pop this in the microwave and
mixed it all together and this was so
good I just sat in my room and drank
this whilst again going on my phone
so now I'm moving on to skincare either
just wanted to be pretty quick tonight I
just decided to use my Garnier micellar
solution I love this it is so good for
removing skin makeup and then I just
removed my eye makeup separately and
then on his finish off with a little
super skin moisturizer as this makes my
skin feel so moisturize and I just
absolutely love it and then I decided to
pick some stuff out for a bath as I
wanted to have kind of a pamper bath so
I first of all just went through all of
my soap &amp;amp; Glory and picked out a few
bits and bobs that I fancied using and
then I went to my lush box and I just
picked out my Snow Fairy shower gel the
comforter and think pink bath bomb as if
you guys didn't know already I think
pink is my favorite then just lit some
candles around the bath and made it feel
really cozy before adding my bath balm
in and relaxing whilst in there
when I got out of the bath I just
decided to moisturize using my soap &amp;amp;
Glory sugar crash body cream and I just
moisturize my feet as I feeling pretty
dry which is kind of disgusting but yeah
and then I decided to go over my nails
again as they were pretty chipped so I
just used my Essie Bahama Mama nail
polish for that and then whilst they
were drying I decided to go on to my Bay
which is Netflix I love Netflix so much
and I just decided to go to the horror
section tonight for some reason I don't
really know why but I was kind of in the
Halloween mood because I filmed this
before Halloween so yeah I just kind of
looked at some Horrors and watched a
horror
other than that my night was pretty much
YouTube Netflix food and sleep Luco they
didn't really do much else so yeah that
was basically my night routine okay so I
hope you enjoyed the video but now I'm
