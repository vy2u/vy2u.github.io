back with my back to scores of high
school walk for 2016 I am so excited
this video because these are literally
my favorite back to school video to film
like I think I've done like two of these
on my channel now one last year and one
the year before and that was like one of
my first videos my back to school
supplies haul so we're throwing it back
I have some really cute stuff to show
you this year because I'm getting older
I'm getting more into like the
stationery how exciting and I just like
to get the things that are kind of like
Tumblr or We Heart It whatever you want
to call it but I also want to do like a
DIY school surprise video so please let
me know you want to do one of those
because I have some really cute ideas so
uh let me know but yes so further ado
I'm going to get straight into the video
because I do have a lot to go through
I know you guys wanna see so I'm going
to stop rambling and hope you enjoy I'm
going to start off with like the most
basic thing ever and it is a pencil case
and now I got the same one last year
it's basically just a clear pencil case
I don't like to go for like any fancy
ones because at the end of the day just
a pencil case so I just got this from
wilkinson it was like 50 P it ends up
breaking like a carpet in a year anyway
so I just picked up that I was I think
they're really handy because then you
kind of see everything inside of it
which is what I like I then picked up
the other basic things that you need and
they are pens and pencils so I just got
these little concerns at 10 wooden
pencils and they are just black I like
these black pencils because they have a
rubber on the end and they're really
cheaper though there were like 50 piece
of ten again then for my pens I got
these paper mate comfort matte ultra
pens
I love these pens these are so good like
literally I went through so many of
these last year these are the only pens
I can really like right well in I know I
like them and then to go alongside that
of course I have to get like that other
basic thing so I just got this helix
Oxford maths
I suppose you could call it it doesn't
have a compass in but I do have one of
those from last year because I only
bought like we weren't towards the end
of the year anyway so this just has like
a ruler in a detractor
the triangle thing which I've never had
to use in my life but pretty good I mean
that was a pound not too bad and then to
match with that I've got the helix
Oxford rubber and sharpener I just got
these from Wilkinsons as well they were
like 50 P each which I thought was
really really good considering their
helix and I liked it and like mostly
branded stuff because I feel like it
just lasts longer and it's a lot better
quality as well even though we're just
talking about a rubber and a sharpener
and every single one does the same job
but I liked them I thought they look
nice so I got my basics I then picked up
just a normal pretty stick glue stick
everybody needs a glue stick because I'm
always that person that doesn't have a
glue stick and then nobody else has one
and then I can't stick anything kin so I
going to stick that then this is
literally one of my like favorite things
ever and you're just going to be like
why so many sharpie when you have like a
little addiction to stationery like I do
when you see a mini sharpie you will
have like a mini freakout and I was so
excited to see this I me and amber and
Wilkinson's
and she was just like I'm gonna buy a
mini sharpie and I was like oh my god do
they have black boys and she was like
yes oh uh we got a mini sharp it dropped
it so we've got mini sharpie and I'm
very chuffed with that as you can see
she's really cute then to add a bit of
color back into my pencil case because
it is kind of all like dark and I don't
want it all to be dark so I just got
some highlighters these are my favorite
highlighters in the world they are this
Stabilo flash highlighters I love how am
I trying to read the names up there
makeup products but no they're not
they're just basic highlighters these
are like two pound fifty which is like
the most expensive thing I've bought
like all my basic stationery but they
are so good these literally lasted me
the whole year last year I just wanted
to buy a new set because they were
starting to run out but yeah I got off
set of highlighters and I'm obsessed I
also then got just a pack of sticky
notes I feel like you always need sticky
notes like just to remind yourself of
something called you to stick it in your
books you know where you are I thought
this would be really handy I thought
they have some like cute colors as well
like yellow green dark pink orange and
light pink they're not coming up as I
was vibrant on camera they're really
vibrant in real life but yeah they're
only 50 T what a bargain
and
the other like stationary thing I've got
to go my pencil case was a pack of
pencils and these are the big kids
trophy colors set you get our 18 in here
which I thought was quite a good deal
I'm not going to lie I don't really have
much to say about these to be fair
they're just pencils but I got them
because you've got like two shades of
purple and two shades of pink and I
never have like pink coloring pencils or
purple color and pencils yeah they're
kind of always the shades that I want so
these are only two pounds in Wilkinsons
as well as you can see I love it organs
and this is a sponsored by the way but I
just left them pencils basic need them
there we go and then the last two things
I thought often Wilkinson's are just
some folders because I feel like you
always need folders at school and I'm
kind of like a folder addict I suppose
so I just got this mini a51 first and it
doesn't look mini but it is and it's
just kind of like the perfect size for a
book or your planner that's why I put in
anyway I put my book on a planner in it
then I've got an a4 one so uh I have two
of these I can put all my papers in them
and I just kind of like to keep
everything organized in my bag and I
don't want to leave them to get lost or
anything so I just got some folders very
handy always need those and it's so hot
in here so good oh my god things oh this
makes you feel like hotter
I don't know so many times I feel hotter
feels amazing life then other things
I've got are from a shop called
HomeSense and I've had these a while but
I wanted to show you them anyway because
I've really loved them and they're
another bunch of folders but you guys
are going to fall in love with them as
well when you see them so you've got
three in like well you got nine in the
pad but this three designs so the first
one you got was like this marbled print
and then it's just like a pastel pink
inside it's not showing up very well
because of the lighting but I'll try and
do an overview but yeah it's just like a
marble print and then then there's a
black one and it says
bumpers barmy that was like the worst
joke in the world it says focus really
like this and it's just again pink
inside and it's just got this copper
writing on then this one is probably my
favorite this is a pastel pink one and
it's got this gold writing on it this
says file and forget and I thought this
is really really good like I don't I
love folders so kind of when I saw these
I was just
a little bit inside so I should very
much enjoy organizing my school stuff in
there then the following two things I've
got from home sent out some notebooks so
the first one I got is this this black
one that says notes and I love this I've
had this a while now but I've been
saving it for school it's just really
nice it's got this driving pattern and I
just love the polka dots I feel like
there's always the notepad you see like
everybody else get and you're like oh my
god why did they get that from they
don't want to tell you HomeSense this
was $4.99 but when you see a cute
notebook you just go buy it then the
other notebook I got I absolutely love
this and it's like a candy stripe one
with the light bulb in the middle and it
is brilliant I just thought this is like
really me and I just love this so much
and it has like the copper detailing
down here and then the pages are just
lined with like a little Candyman stripe
down the side but I just thought these
two notebooks would be like really handy
to have because often you always need
notebooks so that was my back to school
