and I am going to doing like
back-to-school supplies haul for 2017
literally this is definitely my favorite
video from the back to school series so
far I love what you need videos so much
to give me so much inspiration on Wi-Fi
and essentially if there are only quite
early on in August because that home
like most people go out and buy their
stationary stuff even though yes you're
going to broken up a few weeks people
like stationary shop early but yeah
today I am going to hear my societal for
you guys I have so many nice things I've
picked up recently to show you as I'm
actually going back to school but I'm
going into the sixth form so I'm very
excited for that the artisan Bryan
station music form but there's also a
giveaway at the end of this video and I
feel like you're going to stay for so oh
yeah definitely stay until the end of
the video but yet unknown that I really
hope you enjoy the video and let's get
started so first place I went to was
home center if you guys haven't heard or
been to HomeSense literally you are
missing out home sense has the most
beautiful stationery and it's very
similar to what you find in an American
target which I let you got up one target
here so bad like literally they say to
me is amazing when I went last year
baby homes is quite like that which is a
bit more expensive so I managed to get
hold of this gorgeous gorgeous planner
this is an August 2017 to December 2018
planner and it just like flew my and it
just has big plans on it we've got gold
rings and then we need to open it or
pastel pink and gray inside story the
colors not showing up very well all of
the pages are so pretty there's so much
room in there and exactly what I need
silence like YouTube and sixth-form
together I can just write every single
plan that I need to in it and I've got a
planner is such an important part of a
station or maybe everybody isn't either
like it is and this was ten pounds and I
thought that is quite expensive for a
planner but then again I can start using
it now right until the end of next year
and it has so many pages and so deeper
sections so then I also feel like it
isn't I feel like that was actually
really good price the next thing I
picked up from percent again I'm also in
love with and it's basically this green
and white palm tree leaf notebook
this is note singles here and it's just
this gorgeous material because don't
even know what it is it's a real life
as you've got a pink page and it's just
full of lines and paper and I'm going to
be using this for just general notes
that I need to use you in sixth form and
I just absolutely love this and it was
only $4.99 which again you know it's
kind of expensive for a notebook but
then cheap for one like this you know I
mean moving art and then the last thing
I got from HomeSense is this gorgeous
clipboard I basically a copper we're not
really a cop-out more gold gold
clipboard and it's just got these little
crazy designs I said this week and I've
got two of them and I just really like
this I thought that'd be really handy my
mom picked it up for me I don't know how
much it was I think it was only like a
few pounds or something but it was
actually really handy if you don't have
a desk like on our desk I have like a
really wonky dressing table but I don't
have a desk so this will be really happy
Valentine's you work I just want to sit
on my bed and that was only like a few
pounds as well next now because I don't
know what subjects I'm yet taken at
sixth form I think I'm gonna be taking
subject like photography film studies
things that are going to help me with
what I want to be when I'm older so I
never really know like exactly how
notebook I need to get or like I don't
want to get like all fancy ones I've
been deleted for three a-four black
notebook they're bring notebook so I
much prefer these collecting they're
easier to write with and they were
literally two-pound beach from
Wilkinson's
moon pieces have some really cheap and
affordable stationery if you haven't
already been there but yet it just
really good you've got apps that you
know the white paper in here and they're
a really good size and I just bought
three of these because I know that I'm
not only taking for subject my money can
be taking three so I thought once I eat
subject that will come in a huge what
other than I'll come in a huge handy but
that will come as a huge help always
never will because to go with my three
different notebooks I picked up three
different folders they all look like
this they're basically just a poor
folders half see through half black I
like black
sorry I decided to really nice color to
school just kind of like last thing I'd
like to keep it quite plain so again
these are eighty Pete and I just got one
for each subject is so much nicer now
I'm doing like a levels and I'm not
doing Avenue subjects like I was in and
they're going to be extremely hard but
it's nice knowing that I don't need to
like to have folders like twelve thirty
different subjects by padilha GCSE also
while I'm reminded of GCSE I will be
vlogging my reaction to opening my
results and
those energy see results video so make
sure to subscribe to our channel to be
linked down below and when you're gone
to the more like stationary part of it
so I got this pencil case and this is
from home bargains it was only one pound
fifty I thought this was so cute
it's been the Peter's clear and it's got
like white flash pink polka dots on it
and it's really cute gold stick because
I don't normally do any subjects but
it's going to be like requiring a lot of
like stationary like artwork so I
thought this is really good then I
picked up the floor in old usual pens
and pencils so I just got real Clinton's
own brand pencils they're just ten for
like 50 P I think and they will black as
I like the black ones and then I picked
up some of my favorite pens in it with
her favorite pen oh no these are the BIC
crystal original pens and I literally
love these or producing organ exams I
was using these pens I was loving life
living it get these are so good still
it's you know one pound fifty as well
and harder to get for so good I then
kicked up the other classic work pencil
case and must have messed up so I got
this helix Oxford pencil sharpener I
picked this up from real kingdoms and it
was 75 P I feel you always need a pencil
sharpener just in case like if you don't
need it your friends are probably gonna
need one I then picked up another like
helix Oxford's rubber I just like me
drummers I always get the helix stuff
because they're really good quality and
they last me a long time and I think
this is about 50 P again from Wilkinson
then I just picked up a clear ruler
which is again 30p and from Wilkinsons
if you haven't noticed I like
wilkinson's like will be to see some
really good stationery for really good
prices as well and I thought other
things like a ruler I don't really need
to get it branded I then picked up a
little pretty sick because again I don't
know what I'm gonna need glue for yet
but like I know that I'm probably going
to need it so the Peace of many pretty
sick I would definitely recommend
getting brandish glue because I feel
like when you buy like an radically it
just doesn't stick as well or any
frustrate you or just are just me look I
was using the Wilkinsons glue last year
and it just was not doing it for me so I
was like you know what the splurge and
extra sodium vipera stick so I just
bought a pretty thick and I was really
like this I wasn't talking about beauty
product but it's literally glue stick
and I have got this cute little pack of
sticky notes I don't know how many we're
going to get in each but this is only
sixty P as well so I thought that was
really good I thought I could using why
not
some stuff but like I need to get this
done this week or need to get this done
next week or whatever I thought that'd
be really nice we're like color
coordinating everything and finally I
picked up some highlighters now guys I
cannot even comprehend to you how much I
love these highlighters I feel like I've
spoken about them before in video and
actually I'm more than certain that I
have and these are the stabbing though
so I use a savvy lo highlighters and you
basically get a pink of blue a green in
the yellow one but I love them like I
will not use any other highlighters
they're like two pound fifty which is a
little bit expensive for highlight is in
a weird way because you can get some for
a lot cheaper but these are genuinely so
good like they the color is so pigmented
and I kind of coordinate everything
that's how about my brain work so for me
it needs are actually like perfect and I
feel like I was reading one of my
highlighted enough honestly like a lot
owes me so much joy by being so that is
basically everything I have picked up
for myself for school and say I don't
know what I'm gonna be doing yet so I
want you to go buy more and what I
bought too much but for me I think this
is the perfect amount and if you do want
to see me like course and the other
things I get so like close the sticks or
my school bar but what's in my school
bag do let me know down below as well
but then I also picked up a few things
for you guys as well for a little
giveaway so I picked you guys up the
Chevron notepad because it Chevron is
gold it like matches my room I love it
and this cute little pack of pencils
again there's some Chevron ones and they
match screwing really cute with a
notepad and then it's set of binder
