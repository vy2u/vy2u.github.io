going to doing such an exciting video
and this is a bath and Bodyworks haul
for autumn or fall 2017 now one quick
thing I might have a little bit
different because other moment I'm
actually super ill I've got such a bad
cold and I basically look like a head
cold and like a sore throat and
everything but I'm powering through and
I really wanted to film a video for you
guys so that's why I sound a bit dodgy
and I'm very sorry for that but yeah
moving on today I am going to be doing a
huge part of Body Works all for 2017
because I actually went onto eBay and
ordered a load of Bath and Body Works
stuff now I know you probably can get it
shipped to the UK from the website but
every time I go to do it it just never
lets me I'm not really sure why it just
doesn't give the United Kingdom as an
option so I took to eBay and I got a ton
of the new stuff that is out so if you
do want to buy it I promise you the
links are down below so you can go to
the listing that's what I bought any of
this stuff and you can go buy it
yourself
but yeah I am just super excited to get
into this video because I've only ever
done one haul that contains Bath and
Body Works before and it was when I went
to America last year so this is very
exciting for me and I've always wanted
to do one so yeah I really hope you
enjoy the video and let's just get
started
also if you haven't already or if you
didn't already know I'm actually daily
vlogging so if you want to go watch my
daily vlogs I will leave a link on
screen to my latest one or you can just
go to floral-print tests vlogs which is
linked in the description and go watch
on my vlogs also my merch is sending out
super quickly as well and there's only a
few sizes left so go down there shop my
merch as well as all this bar money work
stuff as well as my blog channel let's
get into the video I feel like we just
start off with candles because candles I
like the best thing from Bath &amp;amp; Body
Works ever so I've got one which I've
had from last year which you can still
get anybody because I've checked so I
thought about to include that in the
hall could still have advantage so I'm
saving it for autumn and this is a
pumpkin pecan waffles first of all can
we talk about the lid because it's so
beautiful and then these are three meat
candles oh my god from what I can smell
it's incredible I love the packaging of
these I love the size of them the fact
they have three weeks as well make sure
that they burn evenly which is really
nice and I just love this so much
it literally a smell
come come off always like obviously
that's what it is but it smells so good
it's quite musky in a weird way but I
feel like it's a very autumn scent and
everybody was saying you say autumn and
a weird I just say it like that
I don't know but this was at 21 pounds
and in America they're twenty dollars so
about five pounds more expensive but
then there was no shipping so kind of
works out really good then the one I got
from this year is the like new packaging
and everything it's still in like oh I
forgot what you call this shape a
cylinder and it says the homemade
goodness of pumpkin cupcake and it's
actually very similar in color kind of
actually not really but the new lids are
silver and it says eat dessert first
which is really cute and then obviously
on the front it's just a little black
cupcake with the white and the gold
writing and I just love this so much
this was meant to be 2250 oh yes
twenty to fifty dollars so basically
kind of the same price of what I paid
Alice smells so good it smells it
exactly like pumpkin cupcakes or exactly
what you'd imagine pumpkin cupcakes
smell like because I don't think I've
ever actually smelt one but it's so
beautiful and again I just love Bath and
Body Works candles so much I actually
prefer these to Yankee Candles but it's
just annoying because you can't get hold
of them as easy but like I said now on
eBay so you can go buy these now then I
saw all of the brand new like lotions
and everything like that and of course I
had to pick a ton of them up so first of
all I've got a body wash and this is the
moisturizing creamy body wash with pure
honey and it's in this flavour or scent
marshmallow pumpkin latte out incredible
is its packaging so it's kind of like a
gray sweater then it's got the milk
bottle on here then it's got like tea
and leaves kind of looks Marbley but
it's actually a great sweater and then
the packaging here is just like a Goldy
bronzer color and this smells incredible
it's definitely more marshmallow B than
latte e if that makes sense like it
doesn't really smell like coffee or
lattes it kind of just smells like pure
marshmallows which is incredible I
thought it was actually going to be like
clear and transparent but it's actually
got like a white color to it which is
quite nice but this was meant to be a 14
dollars 50
eight pound 50 so that's like absolutely
incredible and yeah this again will be
linked down below but smells so good I
love this and then I got something which
is actually new to Bath and Body Works
and I've personally never had one of
these before and it's a body scrub and
again I got it in the scent with pure
honey and marshmallow pumpkin latte and
it just looks like this this was meant
to be sixteen dollars 59 paid ten pounds
so kind of the same as a soap and glory
scrub but I literally love this so much
it smells exactly the same as the other
things I'm not going to take this off
but just come to the silver protective
layer which is nice to know that
obviously it hasn't been used but you
get literally like a full tub of it
that's why I really like it and it's a
decent sized tub as well like compared
to my head it looks kind of small but it
is actually a decent size tub and I like
the shape of it as well it's very
different the colors are really or to me
just has a little picture of a latte
with a marshmallow in it and yeah I love
this so much so I'm super excited to use
this I don't let you guys know my vlogs
what I think of it it kind of looks like
one of those scrubs that you make a
Homer of honey and brown sugar if any of
you have ever made one of them that's
what it kind of reminds me off but yeah
love it then of course I had to get the
matching body cream so I got the a latte
love with pure honey
marshmallow pumpkin latte body cream
this is actually in a bigger tube than
the shower gel but I think you get the
same amount because this one's taller
but then this one's wider yeah you get
eight ounces in each which is really
nice and I love this packaging it's
poison it's got the teen little bit
again there has kind of got this Marbley
grey pattern and then again wow it's
kind of like tinted with a bit of a
brownie color which is really nice and I
just love this so much
this wasn't meant to be 13:50 and I paid
ten so that's kind of works out the same
without shipping as well which is really
nice and I just love all the gold
detailing I've used some of their body
lotions before and they are super
moisturizing I absolutely love them and
I think I'm always going to order these
instead of using like other ones that we
can get in our drugstores now it just
sounds absolutely incredible and I love
it so much so yeah 100% recommend these
because I have actually used this
already and then I actually got a mini a
body lotion to keep in my handbag so
this is again is the marshmallow pumpkin
latte scent as you can see love that
scent and this is
a many like old style classic bottle of
it and this is only three fluid ounces
so 88 mils so I think you could probably
take this on an airplane I'm right but I
love the packaging it's just got leaves
and pumpkins and this is just a little
tiny version of it just so you can carry
this around that yeah these two actually
the same thing but I just wanted to get
them both because how Q you probably get
annoyed with this scent now and I can
completely understand but I also got the
matching fragrance mist because I've
actually had a mini fragrance mitten
bath or body whereas before which I
picked up in America last year and it
was incredible it lasted on me all day
and I was like you know what I'm just
gonna have to get another one so this
was meant to be if there's a prior to no
I think it was meant to be 11:50 but I
paid nine pounds so I don't think that's
too bad but it basically looks like this
it's a big bottle it's 176 mils so six
fluid ounces and it has its like white
pumpkins on which the leaves and then I
think it's actually tinted it's kind of
like a brownie color which is really
cute and then it's got kind of like a
copper lead and copper detailing and it
smells incredible I haven't actually
used this yet but obviously it smells
like all of the other stuff so let's
have a spray if I can open it spray it a
few times I'm gonna spray it on me for
don't actually waste it
Wow oh my god why haven't they created
smellivision yet because this is so good
I would 100 ever recommend these body
sprays because this is gonna last me
ages and I have such a bad cold and it's
all I can smell I think I'm gonna sneeze
but it's incredible I then picked up
something new which I've never tried
before from Bath &amp;amp; Body Works and it was
a hand cream and I paid six panel to
this which i think is kind of expensive
because it was any meant to be four
dollars but then kind of have to account
for some things this isn't the scent
pumpkin cupcake and it says pumpkin
butter and I love the colors of this so
it's gold and then it's pink
and it's just Kyla now it's just so
pretty and it is moisturizing sheer
butter and vitamin E so I'm very excited
to try this again I haven't actually
tried this yet because I'm going to save
it for this video I can't really smoke
that much because am i cold but from
what cancer I was not so good actually
is that the same oh my god is the same
as my candle only just realized okay
this is incredible and I love this again
this is going to
in my handbag with my little body lotion
but yeah I love this so much if you guys
could see the size comparison it's kind
of the same size as this if the
packaging just has me at hello and yeah
it's just really cute really small I'm
very moisturizing so love this and then
of course what would a bathroom wanna go
to all be without a pocket back so
actually a little bit of Norwich because
I ordered three pocket bags and I'm a
hundred percent
I ordered three but only one of them has
come and I ordered them from the same
seller so I don't really know what
that's about maybe my other orders
didn't go through but I'm more than sure
I ordered three but the one that came is
unicorn water and this is one of the
brand new ones it's not from like the
autumn range or anything I think it's
just like they're all year-round ones
but I love this so much it's just got
like a rainbow unicorn teardrop moving
unicorn cut out and then it's just got
this bit here but smells so good and so
refreshing and it's got the little blue
beads and then it's just a clear
transparent color but again this this
and this it's all gonna go in my handbag
and it will all look super cute and this
is meant to be $1 75 and I paid two
pounds 50 but I don't really mind paying
that because that's kind of how much I
pay for a hand sanitizer here anyway and
these are incredible so that is the end
of my video I really hope you guys
enjoyed it let me know if you did by
giving it a huge thumbs up but as the
money I thought is something a little
bit different like I don't usually do
much hello like I said because I'm from
England
and II can't really get it that easily
over here but nevertheless go on eBay
links are down below is just as
inexpensive what I say inexpensive it is
a little bit more expensive but it's
such good stuff so it's so worth it but
yeah I love you all so so so much and I
will see you on a Wednesday at 6 p.m.
for a brand new video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
