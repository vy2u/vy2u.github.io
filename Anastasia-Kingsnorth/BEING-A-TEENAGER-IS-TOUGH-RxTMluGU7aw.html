I am back and nobody else in the title
of the video here but I don't actually
know what I'm going to call a video but
basically I'm going to doing a bit of an
advice video today and this is a bit of
a different video to what I usually do
but something just kind of like
triggered me to tweet out like what
problems do you feel like you have as a
teenager so I tweeted this out the other
day and I have no intention of like
filming a video
but everybody's replies were like so
similar and it kind of worried me
because it showed them like everybody
was going through all these problems and
I feel like I've been through them too
and I just want to help you so whether
you see this video as maybe like a big
sister so you can just come to me for
advice whether you're literally just
listening for the sake of watching this
video I don't know I want to do a bit of
an advice video today on teenage
problems such as confidence fake friends
boys or different things that we all go
through that I feel like people could
use some reassurance on so I'm just
going to use some of my like personal
stories and things that I've been
through and things that I've gone
through to kind of show you guys that
you're not the only one feeling that way
and that I literally am in the same boat
as you I am literally I'm sixteen years
old my birthday is in October and I go
to school and in year 11 I'm doing my
GCSEs so I feel the stress like I feel
you on every level and I just kind of
want to like help you guys literally as
I'm just looking through the replies
everybody saying exams school haters
friendships body confident finding a
will to live why mine oh that was a
reply but basically yeah that's what I'm
going to be doing today so I hope you
enjoy the video and let's get started
first something I'm going to cover is
boys because I feel like this one is
quite common in teenagers it probably
shouldn't be but it is so with a bit of
background information if I'm completely
honest with you guys I haven't had a
boyfriend for six seven years and when I
did have a boyfriend it was one of those
like primary school relationships so
whether your counter is a proper
relationship I don't know so basically
I've kind of never had a boyfriend I
have spoken to I would say three people
in the past like year year and a half
all of which have come to an end I'm not
talking to anybody at the moment and I
would be lying if I say that they didn't
take a Ptolemy's because
they did when you're talking to somebody
I feel like it's really easy to get
attached especially if you're not used
to it and if you start to grow feed into
that person and become more fond of them
you'll go to become really attached I've
recently stopped speaking to somebody in
the last maybe like month and I'll be
lying if I said I wasn't absolute you
just draw like I genuinely was because I
was just so like happy in content with
how it was going and then when it
changed like it kind of ruined me a few
times before that I actually was
somebody I was talking to I was
genuinely so devastated when I found out
that it was like finished and stuff so I
didn't want to get up out of bed and I
would just sit in my bed and cry myself
to sleep every night for hours and he
sad as me that like that is what we do
but that is how we deal with it and like
I don't want to know like if you do that
you're not the only one I've done it too
but you do not need to feel alone you do
not need to feel like you need a
boyfriend slash girlfriend I have now
come to terms with the fact that you
don't need somebody at one point I was
like oh my god I really do boyfriend it
was like the hormones as I just really
wanted a partner but now I've kind of
realized that it's just not the time and
you don't need one you are just perfect
the way you are and on your own of
course it's so nice to have one but
please don't ever feel like you need one
because I know especially it's really
hard at school when all of your friends
are talking to so many or all of your
friends have a boyfriend and let you
know you're the only one without one
like I let you know that feeling so much
or maybe like if all of your friends get
asked to prom and you don't like I feel
you but basically my advice on boys
would be just to know your worth when it
comes to them don't ever kind of just
give yourself away try not to get too
attached and I know that's so so so hard
because I got myself too attached and I
got myself deeply hurt but I've
genuinely learned from that situation
and I know not to do that again I may
only be 16 and you probably looking at
me like wow she's 16 she has no idea
what she's on about but like I have gone
through different things and I just feel
like I want to tell you guys that like
know your worth and it comes to boys but
don't ever feel like you're alone or
you're not good enough if you don't have
one because there is somebody out there
for everybody I'm a strong believer in
that and there's plenty of fish in the
sea and you will find somebody the next
topic is confidence now this is really
one that I feel you guys on like
teenagers nowadays if social media
become in such a prominent thing in
everybody's lives
it's something that people struggle with
people tend to see individuals online
and they look at them and they're like
wow they are perfect I want to be like
them whereas I can guarantee you now
that individual online also sees
somebody else and says no that goes
perfect I want to be like them and is an
absolute vicious circle like I
understand with confidence it's
something that you have to work on in
yourself and you have to learn to kind
of love yourself and deal with your
insecurities I have many insecurities
some people probably think I don't but I
do have quite a few that I would never
ever speak about online not because I
haven't come to terms with them but just
because I have learned myself to deal
with them and I've kind of I buried it
in my head that like I'm fine the way I
am there's always going to be things
that you want to change about yourself
there's always going to be things that
you're not happy with and that is fine
because everybody feels like that
confident is something that we really
struggle with and I don't have a lot of
self-confidence like I tried to pretend
like I do but I actually don't I get
really nervous especially when I'm at
school I hate walking around like if I
see certain people I will look you like
crap myself for no reason but like just
because I get so nervous and I don't
have much confidence and I'm like oh my
god I don't look good and I fall like
what if this person thinks this of me
and like I get you but I've learned to
deal with it by accepting myself for who
I am and that's not really cliche but
and it is going to sound really cringey
but basically to do with like my
self-confidence issues I sat down and I
looked in the mirror and I just looked
at the things that I felt bad about
myself and I said but you're like you're
beautiful the way you are everybody has
things they don't like about themselves
and when I looked in the mirror and I
just sat there for an hour in silence it
was about an hour and honestly after I
done that I felt like a new person I've
become really like strong-minded
recently where I've tried to take my own
advice because I'm one to like easily
give advice but then I saw won't take it
but like I've recently took my own
advice and it was the best thing that I
ever done and I'm not saying my advice
is right I'm not saying it's great but
all I'm saying is you are perfect the
way you are as cringing cliches that
sound you are and everybody has
insecurities you are not alone but it's
only you who can build up your
self-confidence like I said I just want
you to
this video is kind of like a big sister
way and know that you're not alone and I
feel it too like I feel like some people
would look at youtubers and be like oh
wow their life is perfect maybe but like
it's not like I'm completely understand
where I'm a teenager I feel everything
everybody is going through I just like
don't really show it the other topic
that people wanted me to talk about was
fake friends and I am very very very
familiar with this the problem is with
me and a lot of my friends will tell you
this is that I'm too nice and I
literally just want to be like friends
with everybody regardless of how they've
trapped me just because like I like to
think I'm a nice person I just like to
be knighted everyone but fake friends
are something that is very hard to deal
with because you sometimes don't
understand what you've done wrong why
they've turned on you or they're being
interface to you and I promise you it's
not you it's them one reason could be
jealousy or maybe they just genuinely
have drifted but fake friends my best
advice for fake friends would genuinely
be to cut them off and that probably
sounds really kind of like straight-up
like cut your friends off no I just
literally mean just like stop messaging
them just slowly do since your self from
them because you don't want their traits
to rub off on you I know it can be
really hard because maybe hurt your
whole friendship group is kind of turned
against you or your best friend is
turned against you and I understand how
it feels like I personally like my best
friend as they were turned against me
like and what I love her - absolutely
ever done that but that I can understand
where you're coming from but actually
cut the negative people out of your life
and learn that you will find better
friends and you will find better people
this world has what like seven billion
people in it I don't know if that's
right there are seven billion people and
we have the Internet and people say the
Internet is unsafe and yes it can be but
Internet is also an amazing place like
even going to the comments now right
that you want to make a friend and go
and reply to each other's comments and
make some internet friends I have made
some of the best friendships from
YouTube up genuinely saffron jazz Lewis
Eve Sophie Kaitlyn Hannah like oh
there's so many people today I'm so
excited and menu because it's just
absolutely look there's hundreds of
people I've been on the internet but I
love to pieces and I generally don't
know what I'd do without them now so go
make a friend in the comment like get
rid of your fake friends are going
new friend so yeah I nobody know what
the point of this video was but it was
basically to tell you that you're not
alone and being a teenager is hard and
juggling GCSEs and revision and I've got
YouTube on top of that and general life
and general problems like it's hard it's
tough but we will get through it
every teenager suffers from it and as
together as a group we're gonna do this
team Internet have got this like we are
a strong family but literally if you
ever want to talk to me just either
leave a comment down below or if it's
kind of private you want to ask for
advice DM me on Instagram and I promise
I'm going to sit through my DMS and I'm
going to sit and properly apply to you
because I know if I watch a video like
this I'd probably want to ask for advice
I'll probably want to ask questions so
of course do that dear me on Instagram
Twitter tweet me whatever you want to do
but yeah I know you know the point of
this video but hopefully you got some
advice from it and you just know you're
not alone and everything that you're
dealing with everybody else is too but
things will get better but other than
that I will be back with a normal like
chatty possibly a-hole I don't know
video next Sunday but yeah and I love
you all so much and I will see you next
Sunday at 10 a.m. for your brand new
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
