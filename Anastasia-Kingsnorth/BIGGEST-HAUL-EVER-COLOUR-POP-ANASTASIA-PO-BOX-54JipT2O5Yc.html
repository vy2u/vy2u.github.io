back and I'm going to be doing an
absolutely huge haul this is definitely
hands down at the biggest haul I've ever
done on my channel I received so many
amazing things in the post recently a
few of which I bought but most of which
brands have sent me and I'm super super
grateful for all of it
I have tried most things in this video
so I thought I would do a huge p.o box
haul showing you what I've got some new
things that are coming out and yet just
things that I've received which I'm
absolutely loving I am NOT bragging at
all I'm purely just showing you guys
what I got and this is a huge thank you
to the brands that have sent me this and
I know you guys love watching holes and
these are definitely my favorite video
to film my channel so I thought I would
do another one but yeah I'm just going
to get straight into it because I
genuinely have too much stuff to show
you
so the first loads of things I got are
from Too Faced now I've had this package
a while and I'd be super excited to show
you guys it so hopefully you've seen it
in the thumbnail but it is this huge
huge huge box and it says two-faced
dollar and it's got this - ombre peach
going on and inside they sent me the
full collection of the new sweet peach
range so I've taken it all out that the
box was like absolutely insane so I'm
going to show you what was inside I
genuinely cried when this came like
staff flogged me crying like it was so
amazing so literally I've got the sweet
peach palette which is insane I've got
one of the colors on my eyes today is
this shade here in the crease I hope you
can see that but yeah loving that
then I got the sweet peach glow a little
trio which has three different shades of
highlight in it I love this this is
gorgeous this one is my favorite this is
the only one I've used at the moment and
I have this on today as well I used most
of this makeup today to show you but
loving that I then have the papper don't
peach blush which looks like this and
you just open it out and it's it's
gorgeous shimmery pink blush again I
have this on today it's very very subtle
which I like which means it's perfect
for school and it has a gorgeous tool
mirror on it as well which it's very
nice and then I got every single shade
of the new lip gloss
this is the creamy peach oil lip gloss
I'm yet to try these out and oh my god
they have little peaches on the top I'm
super excited to try all of these out
I'm not normally a lipgloss person I
feel like I'm really going to like these
so I absolutely love all that thank you
so much to you face it also came the
little peach clutch bag and it was just
such a beautiful package to receive and
I genuinely am so lucky so thank you so
much I really appreciate it I then have
something from Vera Wang and they sent
me their brand-new princess of hearts
perfume this is coming out in February
and it retails at 450 pounds I wore this
yesterday and it is so gorgeous it just
looks like this and I personally think
it smells like strawberries yeah it
definitely smells like strawberries it's
such a beautiful perfume and I'm not
normally a huge perfectly person but I
did have it the Vera Wang Princess
perfume a while back and I loved it so
super excited to try this out I then
have summit palettes from models own and
this is the scoped and glow palette and
the bori 43 barely there I'm so bad at
reading the barely-there palette and
sculpting glow palette I haven't used
these yet I have a lot of models eye
makeup in my collection
and I don't really use it that much but
what I have used is really good and this
has some gorgeous shades in it so I
would definitely recommend you guys go
and pick these up from super Drive I
absolutely love them and if you send a
panel or in Superdawg at the moment you
get a free palette of your choice so
that's fab so don't recommend you go and
do that
terrible teaser then always keep me
stocked up and they sent me their brand
new tangle teezer this is the ultimate
multipurpose
tangle teezer and it has a really nice
handle on it which I love because I
always like when I'm brushing my hair
with the tangle teezer it just goes
flying around my room I don't know how
it happened so I have this now which I'm
very very chuffed about so thank you so
much tower teaser for keeping me stocked
up because you always need a new hair
brush it then has some stuff which I
bought from Anastasia Beverly Hills so I
recently picked up their ultimate glow
kit now I know I should get hold of this
and when it was on beautybay and I am so
happy about it because it's gorgeous I
love the shade and the gold for what I
tend to do is mix all five of these
shades together and put them on my
cheeks I have this under the Too Faced
one just
make it pop a bit more and then a
normally put snow might in a corner but
I put burgundy white inner corner today
so I didn't use this but I really do
love this palette it was 44 pounds and
when I last checked it had been out of
stock but if it goes back in stock by
the time I'm putting this video up I
will definitely link it down below I
then picked up the a massages every
Hills contour kit in the shade light to
medium I've wanted this contour kit for
a long long time I don't normally a
contour my face massively but I really
wanted this palette because I saw the
saffron had it and it looked so nice and
I think it has made a difference to Thai
makeup I've only used it three days so
far because I haven't had long at all
but I'm really really liking it and I
use this powder to set my under eye
makeup today so hopefully it will make a
difference and if it does I'll let you
guys know by then it placed an order
over on color pop recently and I'm
obsessed with the things that I got so
first of all got the ultra satin lip
from the Amanda steel X color pops
collection and this is in the shade
jiffy I really wanted to open her
collection because I do love her videos
and I have done for a long time so I
just got the ultra satin lip the
packaging on this is gorgeous and I'm
yet to wear this yet so I'll have to let
you guys know what it's like but I've
used color pop lipsticks many times in
the past and they've been incredible I
then picked up the colour-pop ultra
matte lip in the shade saturday and I
love this I wanna SH in my latest selfie
on Instagram when I'm filming this but I
had like a burgundy lip and like this
lip color on is a little bit patchy if
you only wear one layer so I after you
add two layers but when you'd like layer
it up it's gorgeous so I picked that up
then I picked up five minis and this is
you colour-pop ultra matte mini
collection and you have to shade Bianca
Tully no shouldn't love bub and lax and
I don't actually have my Bianca anymore
because I lost it so super excited to
have these little cute ones and I can
just chuck them in my bag whenever I
need them I think this is about ten
pounds so not bad at all when I went to
beauty corner Real Techniques stalked me
up on a ton of things they gave me two
of the diamond Beauty blenders they gave
me all six sponges and then a new
setting brush so I'm super excited to
trial these out I swear by the orange
sponge in here so everything else should
be amazing and Murray's been using the
recently as I gave her one because I got
more than two and she loved it so I
would definitely let you guys know my
opinions on these what I've used them a
bit more
lore'l also sent me some things to my P
box so I have the gold obsession
lipsticks I have all 5 shades here I
have to say my favorite one is this gold
one if I can get it open
it just looks like this and I think this
is such a gorgeous color if I just
swatch it on my hand like I think I
Hanno's been wearing this a lot recently
fabulous Hannah and yeah I absolutely
love these so thank you so much Laurie
off all of these can't go wrong with a
few new lipsticks I genuinely swear by a
lawyer Schumer foundation so like Lori o
is one of my favorite brands then this
morning I received a package from a
Maybelline which is incredible and they
sent me some of their new things to try
out so they sent me the Baby Lips at
color bomb crayons and I have five here
I've done over this five or six I
possibly have the whole collection here
but this one is definitely my favorite
because I love a few nudes but then I'm
also really feeling this color because I
like to be a bit adventurous with my lip
colors as you can probably tell even
though today I'm just wearing a nude one
but I love being adventurous with them
oh yeah this is nice I like that so yeah
I'm definitely going to be wearing these
more I think these retail for about 5
pounds so not too bad for a really good
lip crown actually then they sent me
their brand new the falsies push-up
angel mascara and I'm not sure this out
yet but I use this on my eyelashes today
so I could tell you guys my honest
opinion and I really really love it
hopefully you can see my eyelashes have
gone up quite a bit and they do look
kind of fake so yeah I really really
love this and the wand is incredible as
well I mean it's such a different one
but it makes such a difference on my
eyelashes and I'm pretty sure this
retails for around 8 pounds election
cosmetics it then sent me a ton of stuff
as well which is incredible I'm not
going to have time to go through all
because this is incredible how much they
sent me but they stopped me up all my
favorite concealer wherever I put it
there's some you ton of the collection
concealers they sent me their new velvet
kissed lip reign which I'm obsessing
over of all this color so far I love it
they send me their highlight two sticks
lip liners eyeliners I'm really excited
to try these these are the glam crystals
dazzling gel liner and ivory
so you went eyeliner a bit more over on
my Instagram so super excited to try
that out so thank you so much collection
for sending me all of this I will
definitely do more on my Instagram as
I'm turning my Instagram into more of a
makeup type page so definitely go follow
me if you want to see more of this then
I received the Molly cosmetics silly
sponge from the map metics and it looks
like this I actually did a video on this
which went live last night I never
normally upload on a Saturday but I
wanted to get this video up you guys
ASAP so when you're watching this I'll
leave a link on the screen now and a
link in the description to go and watch
my opinions on this as I haven't
actually opened yet I'm filming after so
super excited to try this then I finally
received a ton of stuff from boohoo
boohoo have been amazing to me recently
I've got so many of my clothes from
there and I'm loving them so I have
another huge parcel from today I got so
many different things I tend to get a
lot of basic t-shirts from boohoo so I
just got this camel color t-shirt I got
a great swing dress which I'm gonna wear
to a party that I have very soon with
and knee-high boots I also got from
boohoo I always do boohoo all over on my
snapchat so at my snapchat and you'll
see like everything I got but I also got
this cross pink sweater which is really
similar to the one I have on now which
should pay hmm because so many of you
guys asked that it just looks like this
and it's really distressed at the end
which I love I love like distressed
things and then I got some chokers I got
some more plain black tops but I'll even
link to everything in the description
box down below so I'm pretty sure that
is everything in my haul I went through

basically everything I have on my
snapchat Twitter and Instagram so made
