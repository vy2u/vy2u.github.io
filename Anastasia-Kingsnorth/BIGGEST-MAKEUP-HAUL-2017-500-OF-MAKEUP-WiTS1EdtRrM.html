and I am going to be doing a absolutely
huge makeup haul normally when I say
absolutely huge I mean like very big but
I literally mean absolutely huge I have
recently been sent so much makeup that I
have bought so much makeup like I don't
know where it's all come from I just
need to show you because I'm loving
using on everyday basis and you guys
said you love my board as well so I
thought I would give you a huge makeup
haul that you guys can take hopefully to
takes inspiration from also please mind
my hair today I had it down and I was
like you know what it doesn't look right
but I just shoved it up in a ponytail so
you can have to do with that I'm sorry
anyway I'm going to get straight into
this video because I have a ridiculous
about the makeup to show you so I really
hope you enjoy it and let's get started
I'm going to start off with a repurchase
that collection actually sent me and it
is the collection elastic section
concealer I don't need to talk much
about this you guys know that I love it
so much this is in the shade fair one
this is my ultimate auto favorite
concealer I recently been using new Kat
Von D concealer and the NARS one I
should have makeup syrup on my channel
it is not already you'll be up soon if
it's up only not on the screen now but
yeah I bought this other repurchase but
I literally am obsessed with this
concealer so after you love that then I
picked up a new foundation and I picked
it up from Beauty Bay and then as the
Milani it concealed
unperfect 2 in 1 foundation and
concealer I really wanted to try this
I've heard a lot about it and I was like
hey where can I get Milani so I went on
to Beauty Bay and it has a pump as well
I do think it had a pump into a few days
ago that are very like I was
accidentally lifting the whole lid off
instead of just this part the it does
have a pump and mine is in the shade 0-1
creamy vanilla so as you can see is a
little bit too dark for me but I also
mix it with my L'Oreal True Match but
honestly this is such a good foundation
it's not too sick but it is very creamy
which I really like if it was too thick
and I wouldn't be able to use it it just
doesn't set right on my skin but this is
really good for your skin and it does
give a lot of coverage as well and it's
a concealer and foundation in one I
still proceed to use concealer obviously
because I need a little bit more like
how close you spots and I like to just
brighten up my undereyes but a debate
this is incredible and it has medium to
full coverage lightweight oil-free
formula it's perfect for any skin long
wearing a water resistant and sweat
proof and I definitely agree with sweat
proof because I went on a super long
walk and I wore this I think come off at
all so I think I paid about 12 or 13
pounds of this which is normal around
normal dress store price so amazing
purchase I recently was also lucky
enough to get some things and some
benefit so you guys know I'm a sucker
for their hoola bronzer and I recently
went on a trip to at Benny island which
was an island off the coast of ethics
that they completely dive in benefit if
you guys want to see my blog I'll link
it on screen and down below but when I
was there they actually gave me a mini
Hoonah bronzer with my initials on it it
said a K and I love the food a bronzer
this is a mini one and it also has a K
on the brush as well but a hoola bronzer
is one of my favorites I had it on today
not the many one I'm using I did one up
first but who that is just incredible
it's the perfect shade for me so whose
light is a little bit too light if i mix
it with this then it does work perfectly
so yeah I've got another hula and then
it was also there I already have this
but there's going to be another one and
it's the dandelion twinkle except it
also has my name on it
I like obsessed because I've always
wanted a benefit point with my name on
it ever since I started YouTube
everybody was getting them all like oh
we're going to want one so bad and I
can't believe I actually have one and
the brush also is personalized as well
and it says Anastasia and I don't know I
just love this so much again I haven't
used this when I'm using my other one at
first but it's actually a really good
blush I believe it's meant to be
highlight but I used the blusher and I
think it works a lot better but yeah I
absolutely love this so thank you so
much to like Anthony Estelle and yet
benefit it acted incredible I love it so
much
moving on I've recently got an
incredible package from the one and only
two face and I think you wanted to cry
when a box like this big turned up at my
door I just says all that glitters on it
and I was like okay Wow and then I open
it and it had every single shade of the
brand new melted latex in it so I've got
three here and these are three of my
favorite so the brand new melted latex
are basically liquefied
I shine lipstick so they're very like
glossy lipstick this is very different
from me I don't usually wear gloss I
always went mad but I'm very excited to
give these a try so here I've got the
shade
can't touch this then I've got a clear
one which is called girl on top and then
I've got a nude one which is called
peekaboo I love the names of them I love
the packaging as well because you're
going to I always wear my Too Faced
melted in child star so the packaging is
incredible and when you line them up in
your drawers they line up perfectly like
they're so again these two are two of my
favorite shades and they are
ridiculously pigmented like they are so
pigmented especially in the darker
colors like the purple one this one like
blues this and bright red I don't know
with a green or I'm just making that up
but it was a bit like a bright orange
there were some incredible shades if you
do want to see all the other shade I'll
link the blog blog blog down below where
I did a huge unboxing of it but yeah so
these are three of them thank you so
much to to face they are so pigmented
and last a long time as well I usually
have quite a lot of trouble with lip
glosses because it's tend to stick to my
hair and just like come off but these do
last a lot longer so I definitely
recommend them also in the parcel with
the brand new to face glittered bond
palette and how cool is this so each
letter has a different code Lister in it
and you can like pull it around and it's
just other than all the glitter forward
I just love it so much you've got like a
nude a pink purple blue light blue green
and yellow and then when you open it you
have glitters they also sent me lychee
very politically which I already have as
well with it but you get two bases so
you get the brightening base and the
intensifying base I mean ten spine base
is black and then you get eight
different blister shades if I just watch
them for you here you're going to
literally see how incredible they are
that I have all you guys can see that
maybe I should swatch a darker shade if
I push the purple one for you but they
work better when you've got the base
underneath but oh my god these glitters
are incredible and like I'm a sucker for
glitter like if you guys follow my
Instagram or follow my Twitter you will
see that I do a lot of makeup looks with
glitter so having this palette is going
to be a lot of help plus because it's
what people like compact it's a lot
easier to take around and the packaging
is so easy to look at so
I love this next we've got something
from urban decay and pretty sure you go
over to Phoenix all over the internet if
you're brand-new urban decay negative
heat pallet now oh my god okay over the
West are you guys know I love my
burgundy eyeshadows my go-to are to look
is burgundy and everybody's like
creating something else and I'm like no
I'm not bagging D and then you open then
ATT and it's all Burgundy's I literally
can't like I've done entire look the
other day and I use the use two shades
here and then put this one in the outer
corner and I put that all over my lid
and oh my gosh this is just this is the
palette for me like this is my palette I
love all the other naked palettes don't
get me wrong they're all incredible but
this one is just something else like I
absolutely love it these are my perfect
shade I love the packaging as well the
packaging is like definitely the best
out of all of them so far
I believe it retails for 40 pounds that
I was lucky to receive in a PR package I
absolutely adore this so much and let me
just watch one of the darker colors for
you like how incredible is the
pigmentation on that I love it so much
and if you guys would like to see a
tutorial with this then maybe let me
know down below because I never know
what to toriel's to do but I would loved
inventory losing this is so pigmented
and we have another palette to show you
so this one is from Mac and it is the
brand new Mac Mac girls fashion fanatic
palette if you don't follow my Instagram
I was actually lucky enough to go on a
shoot with Mac so there's a brand new
palette where I created a makeup look
folder because I'm one of their Mac
girls which is absolutely incredible I
explain it all on my Instagram but I
still can't get over it so this is the
palette and it's brand new out you can
buy it now and again how's burgandy in
it and it looks I created when I was on
the shoot with them I use the burgundy
shade and I use the orange shade but it
is so gorgeous or welcome see the lights
I can load my room got a big mirror as
well which I really like and you can
also use it out of highlighter which is
really nice you kind of got a bit of a
two in one going on but it's such a
pretty palette and the packaging is well
it's very different which I like I've
never had a Mac palette like this before
I've always just made them up myself so
I'm very happy with this and I think I
feel like I don't know how much retail
that if I find out I'll put it on the
screen or in the description box down
below but either way it is incredible
and
also this glitter shade can you guys see
this okay we just swatch it I hope you
guys can see it because it's so so
pretty
yes I have three pallets to use up at
the moment but if you do want to see any
tutorials then just be let me know I
learned it recently picked up some new
eyeshadow brushes because I always
useful technique and I was like you know
what I'm going to venture out a bit and
try some new ones so I actually have the
morphe brushes here and they are two of
these black and rose gold ones so I've
got the morphe r39
animal BR 37 and I'm pretty sure I've
got the are 38 as well but it's in my
pot which is on my bed these are amazing
brushes I've always wanted morphe
brushes that's what like a new morphe
fall and literally just their brushes so
i thought i'd pick them up finally
because i use their contour brush but
it's like a very very old one thinking
maybe like the e30 for I use in their
contour but honestly these are amazing
brushes this one is really good to blend
and this one's really good for the
crease so they were only about 4 or 5
pounds each as well from beauty base so
if you are looking for some good brushes
that aren't real technique kind of so
many people use Real Techniques I would
definitely recommend these next I picked
up something from a tree called moon and
you know when you just go to like your
local supermarket if you go start your
Tesco or your aster and you're going to
have the beauty art and they've got some
Beauty bit all that happened so I picked
up the true sheer love body butter from
tree called moon and I am obsessed with
this Wow oh my god
it smells so good and this is it a 24
hour super nourishing body butter but
body photos are in a book machine butter
and sherry oil this is only 4 pounds and
I'm a sucker for like body butters and
body creams I love more soap &amp;amp; Glory
ones but I also love using other brands
as well so I absolutely love this and
it's a real big bottle as well like you
doing on my face I always keep you guys
updated with wise think of them in my
vlog so you guys definitely go check
that out if you want to see more about
it but actually might put a bit on my
hands right now because it's platinum I
then recently received a face mask and I
absolutely love this I've always wanted
to try it and it is incredible
and it is the Hollywood California glam
glow flash mud I'm proving a greater
than what a pair of glam glow I saw it
first of all when I was into 4 in
America I already knew about it but it
was very expensive I didn't like buy it
just in case like isn't worth anything
but recently they reached
71 for my few box so they're giving it a
try and it says for the 30 times that
used it three date no three days in a
row and then you did once or twice a
week I've used it three days in a row
and I'm genuinely seeing a difference I
don't know I said how about products but
I really really AM so I absolutely love
this you just open it is not like the
Goldi classic one it's like a I don't
know what you call it really it's just
like a creamy one with black dots in but
sounds really nice not really very very
fresh actually doesn't make it have a
scent but it smells really fresh but I
just pop this on in circular motions I
don't put it all over my face I just put
it in my t-zone here and on my chin but
it's really really going to get a very
decent sized pot for your money as well
and it feels nice you know what I mean
like I've been a lotta money on cheaper
face masks but this one actually feels
really nice then finally we have some
packet things to show you guys the first
oh I've got some other face masks that
I've been loving and these are from
holler and glow so if it means that I
was in Primark the other day and they
are three pounds and oh my god that's so
good they're sheet master they're really
good if you're traveling like in the car
or on the plane or something then
they're also really good if you're like
in a hurry to get ready you don't have
time to put one on and wash it off use
if you want to pop it on and wreck it
straight off so I've got the unicorn
exist illuminating 1 under bossing it's
hydrating one and the coursing is the
bug how it actually looks like the
literally how it comes out this has
unicorns all over it I don't have
unicorn all over it and then this one
just has a girl with glasses and that is
if you what it looks like so I love
these so much you can leave them off for
as long as you want I leave them on
about 15 minutes and it says skin
hydrating and rejuvenating blend and
half lotus flower extracts Bambi water
and bitumen b5 so they aren't really
good for your skin and they do make it
feel very moisturized and very fresh
the vinyl being either easily picked up
is from the brand yes - now I'm actually
I think I'm allergic to this brand like
well the face wash because when I used
it I broke out but I wanted to try
something else so I try - yes - coconut
hydrate and withdraw withdraw while
restore so you get step 4 which is the
exfoliating lip scrub and this comes in
the top part of the packet then you get
set - which is the plumping lip mask now
I don't want my lips to look any plumper
that's not what I've got them for
because I know I do have quite big lip I
got these chiusa kind of books
I do have quite big lips they get very
crack so I used something it was going
to keep their brain boys driving about
in this Cerner when I'm out and about
because my lips it does tend to crack
easy just because I do have quite big
lips so this is five pounds and my
friend actually recommended it to me but
the thing I really like about it is as
well you can also use the mask up in one
go but then you've got the lip scrub to
use more than one you can just better
the packet in half and keep the lip
scrub which is exactly what I'm going to
do but yeah I actually have so decided
to use this so I'll tell you guys I
think about it in my blog but it was
only five pounds I picked this up from
boot so that is the end of today's video
I really hope you enjoyed it like I said
it actually was a big big makeup haul
for once so I really hope you enjoyed
the scene so the new makeup bits that
I've picked up but yeah that at the end
of this video I really hope you enjoyed
give it a huge thumbs up if you did and
I will see you next Sunday at 10 a.m.
for a brand new video
