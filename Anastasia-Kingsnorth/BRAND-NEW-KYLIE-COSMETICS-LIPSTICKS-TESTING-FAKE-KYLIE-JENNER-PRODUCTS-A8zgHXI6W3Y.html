and I'm here doing a testing at
brand-new fake Kylie cosmetics lipsticks
video as a proper long-winded title will
probably change it but basically today I
am going to be testing it some fake
Kylie cosmetics products now I ventured
out onto eBay and I wasn't even looking
for Kylie Jenner stuff I was just
looking at makeup in general and on the
side these lipsticks popped up and I was
like wow I've never seen those before
and they were basically so many had made
these congener lipsticks that I'd never
come out before literally I've never
seen anything like these but they looked
really interesting the one thing about
it is I love the packaging and the box
and everything about them so I just
thought I'd buy them even though I know
they're fake and make a whole video on
them for you guys just to warn you about
fake Kylie Jenner products so these
retail for 25 pounds and I know I paid
quite a lot but I then worth it to me
for the video because I know you guys
would love it so this is the box that
they came in they came in this box here
there's 12 different lipsticks in here
but as far as it looks it looks like
Kylie Jenner it has Carly written on top
even though there is a little bit
missing out of the eye and then it is
gold it has Carly written on both sides
here has the paint drips but then on the
front and on the back it says lipstick
12 pieces now the first thing is
sketching about this is i 100% ordered
12 different shades and i open the box
and they've sent me 12 of the same shade
so that's the first sketchy thing about
it they've sent me 12 of the shade leo
and i notice this first of all when they
put a little sticker on the front that
says leo and there's it literally it
just screams fake so when you open the
box you see 12 different lipsticks like
this and this is what i mean like the
outs you really press e lipsticks
because so sad that they're fake so i'm
just going to take one out and show you
the box so this is the box that they
come in it says kylie matte lipstick on
the top it's gold and it has all the
golden drips then it has the leo liquid
drippy thing in the middle
it just says kylie and then on the back
it actually says exactly the same as
what it says on the
Kylie lip kit because it says Kylie's
tips line lip to lip liner and field
tips in with the liquid lip color and
clearly this is the lipstick so it says
exactly what it says on the back of a
normal cottage and elliptic box but
genuinely I've really liked these boxes
they like nude and they're just really
pretty
which is why it's so sad that they're
fake so then if we open the box inside
as you can see it is very similar to a
matte lipstick if not the same on the
bottom it has a tiny sticker that says
Leo but if you actually there's a
sticker underneath this which makes it
really sketchy I can see like a silver
sticker underneath so I'm just really
intrigued to what is underneath this
because the sticker this is Leo is gold
but I can see something silver
underneath so underneath is actually a
sticker that says so cute which is a lip
gloss shade so this is really sketchy do
I have a Leo sticker and a so cute
sticker on the bottom so the actual
packaging is gold and it just has this
black room here and it says Kylie xoxo
matte lipstick but the Kylie font is
exactly the same but then it is matte
lipstick in the fondant you know just
smells fake no need to see that fun
you're like yeah that's definitely fake
that's been made like really sketchy
that's it so when you open the lipstick
it is black and I mean it's really cheap
quality it's just plastic and then you
twist it up and this is the shade now
they sent me 12 of the same shades and
I'll show you another one in a minute
just to show you that exactly they are
the same and it actually looks an OK
shade when you first open it I mean it
looks extremely mad enough to do me
delicate though like yeah I feel like I
can literally rip that off
so let's swatch it on my hand I mean
first swatch it's so sheer and it's not
even a really nice color if we try and
build it up I mean to me that doesn't
look like leo I feel like Leo is more
not this and not really an exact match
and it doesn't look matte at all in my
eyes this is very very very shimmery
it's very like shear is not gold at all
so the quality of that is absolutely
awful but then like it just doesn't look
like anything's been ripped off of it or
like taken off it just looks like rubber
it looks like one of those lipstick
rubbers that you would have but yeah
it's just not nice at all so these are
all the other lipsticks just so we can
compare I'm just going to open another
one up and this one again says Leo on
the bottom but this one has no sticker
underneath this one just says Leo but
obviously the sticker is so small that
it doesn't completely fit the underneath
then again we have this shade let's
watch it next to it just to make sure I
mean they're basically identical they
are literally identical if you build it
up a bit more do exactly the same I'm
just really curious now to see like if
any the lipsticks have the sticker
underneath because I'm just waiting it
out no this one again it just as leo but
yeah the sad thing about it is I
actually really like the packaging like
the boxes of these lipsticks like if she
came out with these I would treasure
this packaging forever because it's so
gorgeous like I feel like a lot early
expect of expense went into the
packaging more than it went into the
actual lipstick but these are still
really cute to display but overall the
quality is absolutely horrendous so I
definitely definitely would not
recommend these and this is the leftover
lipstick box it just has a ton of the
lipsticks in and I mean I don't know
what to do with these now because I just
have all these fake Kylie lipsticks but
Kylie has never hinted or gave it gave
anything away about any like lipstick
forms instead of being the matte liquid
like you know they're in stick form
she's notice anything about that before
so these are 100% fake and I have no
idea how somebody made these just be
very careful when buying fake Colleague
cosmetic products because most people
tend to go to ebay because obviously
shipping expenses but they are basically
all fake I wouldn't trust eBay for Kylie
cosmetic products I would just stick to
the main website because as you can see
even though these like aren't legit like
she's never made anything like these
before the quality is horrendous and I
mean once again actually feels really
itchy
it just is dried horribly so I'm not a
farm
B
that was my video today I really hope
you enjoyed it just having a look at
some fake collie cosmetic products I
mean it's sad because I actually really
liked all the packaging but what can you
do
so yeah I really hope you enjoyed the
video if you did give it a huge thumbs
up and let me know if you want me to do
so many fake vs. real products on maybe
the Anastasia Modern Renaissance palette
or different things like that but I
really hope you enjoy this video make
sure to subscribe because we have
recently just hit 200,000 subscribers
which is amazing so thank you so much
B yeah I love you all so much and I will
see you in next week's video bye
