doing a back-to-school
beauty haul so over the past couple of
weeks I have been picking up some beauty
products that I'm getting using for
school and I'm going to be taking to
school so if you would like to see what
I got then carry on watching so I'm
going to start with the things that were
actually either gifted to me or given to
me or bought for me so the first thing
is this and it is a Victoria Secret
straight straight Victoria Secret spray
in pure seduction so this was given to
me by my best friend amber when she went
on holiday and she got it for me in
duty-free at the airport and it's a mini
version so I thought it would be perfect
to take to school and this smell is the
best one I've got so far it just smells
so nice and I think it's a perfect like
school scent and it's like a darky pink
so I love it thank you
the next thing I got given was this and
is the maybelline baby skin instant pore
eraser primer thing and I actually
bought this for me for five pounds in
Tesco
so I actually said in a previous video I
don't if I upload it or not but that I
wanted to get this one because I've
never tried it before and I've never
tried this one before but I have now I
tried it twice and it is the best primer
ever I do prefer the Porefessional but
this is definitely the best drugstore
primer like I love the other baby skins
but I absolutely love this and I'm going
to be using this every single day for
school because I feel like it will
really help my makeup stay on and yeah
so mine got me an out for 5 pounds and
it's amazing I'm going to like do all my
drugstore makeup first so the first
thing is this it's the collection
lasting perfection concealer I'm pretty
sure you all know what this is by now
and I just got mine in cool medium too
because they've actually changed the
since I last bought when I used to get
like two or medium - but now it's cool
medium - so yeah and this is much more
my color I really like this because you
know it just gives the perfect coverage
and the perfect finish and it's just
amazing and I much prefer this over any
of my high-end concealer next thing I
got my mum got me and it is the
Maybelline brow drama in dark blonde and
this is just a sculpting brow mascara so
I've heard mixed reviews on this and I
did not want to get it at first but then
basically it was buy one get one half
price and all of this stuff that I kind
of wanted already had or somebody was
already getting for me so I kind of just
thought I'd try this and see how I like
it but I haven't really had a fair
review on this because I'm kind of wait
until I go to benefit when we do our
Meetup
if you don't know about it already like
informational being the down below down
below down bar but I'm gonna wait until
then because I'm getting my eyebrows and
it benefits so I'm gonna start using it
after that so yeah I don't have a fair
of you on this but I've got this for 250
and the other thing from Maybelline I
got was the big eyes rebel black mascara
so this has been out a while now but I
still again never had the chance to try
it until now what not 9 to 5 pounds and
this is the bigger one so as you can see
like smaller at the bottom and then it
kind of twists around it's really
strange but it's really good and then
the lower lash one which is just a tiny
small wand the only thing I don't like
about this is when you take the wand out
you have to wipe excess mascara off from
the bottom the only was scared that I
find doesn't do that is new collection
no clumps but this is really really good
and I'm going to be wearing this
everyday to school and keeping it in my
school makeup bag to drugstore things
I've got one nail polishes and I wanted
to do my now it's really natural for
like when I go back to school and
because our meaning blocks it's really
confusing but I didn't want to go to
like heavy or anything like that so I
just got two maybelline color show ones
I seem to really like Maybelline in this
video but the first one I got was 31
peach pie and it's just this gorgeous
pastel e pinky Brown like it's much more
pastel pink and it's so like
so I can really filled it up if I want
to and that was $2.99 then the other one
I got was like a pinkie glitter with
silver undertones and after we have this
on my ring finger now and yeah the other
nails I'm gonna change the color of and
everything I'm going to do tonight ready
for at school tomorrow but yeah I really
like this color this is 2 3 2 rock chick
or rose chick however you like to
pronounce it and the color which is
stunning I absolutely love it it's one
of their crystallized ones and I've had
my eye on this for a while but never
picked it up but now I thought I would
as it was perfect chance for branding
now - back to school the next two things
I got what kind of accessories I'm not a
sewing school but for kind of outer
school as well so the first thing I got
was an essence sharpener so Ann love you
recommended the Birmingham one but when
I went to get that they didn't have it
any of the boots or super drug so I had
to pick up this one and it's the essence
double-ended duo sharpener and it
actually works really well I was
pleasantly surprised I have got it
because it had like a really big hole
for the collection pencils and the NYX
jumbo eye pencils and it definitely
works it is a really good sharpener I've
only used it a couple of times because
I've only had two but it does the job
for 99p and the other kind of accessory
I got were these and these are the root
X on location and mini brush trio and
I've had my eye on these ever since I
saw them on Google Images and then I saw
them in super drug for 8 pounds and I
just had to pick them up so it comes
with three mini brushes any pointed
foundation brush a multitask face brush
and it I shall I brush all in miniature
versions like prepared to my hand
they're so small and I absolutely love
these I'm gonna using this for concealer
and then this for powder and then I
don't really know what I'll use this for
maybe to like blend it around my nose
kind of definitely one use it for eyes
but yeah these were eight pounds and
definitely one of my best purchases ever
I absolutely love them and they're going
to be in my school bag oh yeah the next
two things I've got west skin care
products so I wanted to kind of help
something to clear up my blemishes so I
decided to try the which naturally clear
dick so I actually got this yesterday
and I've only used it about three times
but I have noticed a difference in my
skin already like I was so so happy so
it comes in like this I see blue stick
as smells really really refreshing and
clean you could just push it back down
and it's just like a clear gel type
thing what you just rub on to your
blemishes and it just fights them all
off before they can even like start to
grow I guess and this was two pounds
from boots and I've saw it in lots of
people's makeup collections and I just
wanted to try it and yeah pleasantly
surprised it really does well and the
other skin care product I got was from
Clearasil and this is the Clearasil
daily clear super fruit refreshing
facial pads and these cleanse and
exfoliate your skin so it comes with
sixty-five and I've used one of these it
says to use them day and night but I'm
only gonna be using them in the morning
before I apply my makeup and I done that
this morning and it really did make my
skin feel so soft and smooth and it
really felt like I don't know it just
feels so nice and these were again two
pounds 70 from boots and I'm really
really I'm happy with these I'm gonna
get the matching face wash because that
looks amazing too but I seriously
recommend these before you put your
makeup on so the final three things I
got are from like high-end so the first
thing is this and it's me benefit full
glam ahead gift set so it comes with
mini deluxe high-beam mini benefits down
in Australia and mini bad girl lash so I
already had bad girl lash and a smaller
version of High Beam but I thought I'd
get this set for 9 pound 95 at the till
because it just looked amazing and all
the products like actually packed away
but it come with his pink tissue paper
and like a money off voucher so I'm
really really worth the money I probably
won't use this all for school but I
really wanted it what I got in the tool
so I kind of had to buy it the other
thing I got from benefit my nan actually
got me and I was so happy because I
don't get seen one that a lot so she
tracked me to a couple of things and
this is the hoola bronzer so when she
said I could have this I was so happy so
I ordered it online and yes all wind of
it so I just take the lid off and there
is the brush and
the brush is so so soft and then the
bronze is inside and it just absolutely
amazing I'm so happy with this it was
2350 but oh love it best bond ever and
the final thing is I know I said the
other thing with my favorite but this is
probably my most like a whole favorite
and this is the urban decay naked
flushed so I got this when I went
shopping at Milton Keynes and I got it
in native and can we just talk about how
gorgeous these colors are the
highlighter is so so so pigmented like
it is the best highlighter ever and I am
going to be keeping this in my school
bag because it's a trio the best rear
I've ever tried and the packaging is
just stunning I absolutely love it so
yeah I picked that for 22 pounds from
the Urban Decay counter in Devon M so
that is everything in my haul I hope you
have enjoyed seeing what I got for
back-to-school and just stuff in general
please give me a big thumbs up if you
did enjoy and what are the videos you'd
like me to like do I'm gonna be doing
some often DIYs and I'm gonna start an
autumn scenery so that will be coming
