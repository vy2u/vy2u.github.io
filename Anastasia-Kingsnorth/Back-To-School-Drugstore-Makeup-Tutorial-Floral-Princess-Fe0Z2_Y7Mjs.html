going to be showing you how to get this
back to school complete drugstore makeup
tutorial so this is a very natural kind
of rosy pinky look for school and this
is going to be my everyday look for
school this year because I really really
like it it's not too much and to be
honest you can't really tell you're
wearing that much makeup so I hope you
enjoy the video and let's get into the
tutorial okay to start off my back to
school drugstore makeup look I would
first of all moisturize I'm just gonna
skip that step off camera today but to
moisturize I usually little super skin
moisturizer because it is perfect for
oily or combination skin I have every
combination skin I have very dry patches
like around my nose and then I have
really really oily patches where makeup
will just sweat off and that is
especially on my chin on my nose and
just around this area here even though
this is really oily my makeup never
sweats off here it's really really weird
but yeah I moisturize using that and
it's a perfect base for any makeup
really now starting on the actual makeup
I'm going to first of all usually
maybelline baby skin primer because this
is a really lightweight primer it gives
it a smooth finish and it's so so nice
to put on honesty like a silicone base
and it feels amazing in your hand and
I'm just going to put this under my eyes
on my forehead on my nose and quite a
bit on my chin because I have to cover
up quite a lot of spots on my chin
the thing I like about this is as well
is it's so lightweight that you can
barely feel you have anything corn and
that sort amazing
so now for my favorite part which is
definitely concealer so this is no shock
to you of course it's going to be the
collection lasting perfection this is
only four pounds 19 and it lasts me
literally half the school year so around
five to six months and it cuz it's only
four pounds it's so so cheap to replace
so you don't need to worry about going
to spend twenty pounds on a high-end
concealer when I think this one is
actually better than a lot of concealers
you can find from maybe Mac or benefit I
just absolutely love this concealer and
it is quite heavy I suppose it's a very
thick consistency but it works perfectly
on my skin and I'm just going to pop
this in the areas that I kind of need it
if you want to get more coverage out of
your concealer it like pays off to do a
triangle shape underneath your eyelid
this will give a lot more coverage and
sorry I can barely talk remember in my
concealer on but this will give so much
more coverage and you'll just notice the
difference a lot from Taylor pop this on
my nose around and then on my chin
because as I said this is working a lot
of blemishes because that's hormonal and
to blend that I'm just going to use it
the Real Techniques expert face brush I
always use this brush I think it's
definitely the best brush to blend like
concealer or foundation in with I just
get along with this best but of course
you can use any other brush you wish
for underwire concealing you can always
use the Real Techniques concealer brush
which i think is amazing as well because
it picks up some product but then you
collect can transfer it to other places
on your face which some people might
love some people might hey I find it
quite helpful but as I said some people
could find that really annoying so I
just stick with a brush like this for
blending now of course you could wear a
foundation I personally don't think I
need a foundation for school I'm quite
happy with just going with concealer as
for coverage focus foundation doesn't
really give a coverage it all gives a
base to work on so if you do my
foundation there are two that I would
recommend they're both from L'Oreal is
in the lower your true matte for the
L'Oreal 24 infallible matte then that
one is if you have quite all your skin
and you need to mattify it down but if
you don't in the lower to match suit you
definitely wear that one because that is
amazing and sometimes when you wear that
you don't actually need concealer
because that one for some reason does
give a lot of coverage so now I have all
of my coverage done and my favourites
right even I'm going to go with a bit of
powder now I'm going to use it the
Maybelline fit me powder because I find
even though this is the most expensive
out of this one and the Rimmel stay
matte I find that this one doesn't go as
cakey on me so people find this one goes
more cakey I think it's perfect I have
one 115 which is ivory which I thought
was the lightest it turns out it's
actually not
I think this like one 110 or something
but they didn't have that when I went so
all I'm going to do is just open it and
take my Real Techniques powder brush I
just dab that in and I just add that all
over my face losing like circle motions
as well because sometimes the powder
just kind of sits on top of my skin when
I need it to actually soak in to blend
all of my concealer in so make sure you
just dab your powered around until it's
soaked into your skin
I learned to focus more powder on my
t-zone because I find that's where I get
most oily you can obviously put powder
all over your face if you need to which
I do but I just put more in my t-zone
because I don't know why my a cup zips
off but it always does so the next step
is blusher now if you're happy with your
face just be in one complete color of
course you can skip this step but I feel
like I need to add a bit more of a
flashback into my cheeks because the
concealer just makes you look completely
one color and I personally like to add a
bit more color so there are a few
blushes you could choose from the sleek
rose gold or a NYX one but you can't
really get that in our drugstore so I've
gone for an Oreo one and this is the
L'Oreal Paris blush in the shade 120 and
I think this is absolutely stunning it
is literally a lighter version of sneek
rose gold and I think I need a lighter
version for school so it doesn't come up
as pigmented so I'm just going to take
my Real Techniques brush blush brush I'm
just going to dab that in there and just
put that lightly on my cheeks
the reason I love this blush so much is
to blow it away is because it doesn't
look too like fake it just looks really
natural it just gives a really nice
natural flush and I'd like to put this
on the apple of my cheeks because it
looks pretty and then if you're happy
with it like that you can just leave it
but I just like to dab a little bit of
powder over mine and that is all I kind
of do for my base I think this is very
natural it's kind of like a no makeup
makeup look for your base but this is a
very high coverage base because I
personally need a lot of coverage okay
so now moving on to eyes I would
normally maybe wear one eye shadow but
for this makeup look I'm not going to
because this is going to be completely
drugstore so I'm just going to go in
with my NYX jumbo eye pencil in milk and
I'm just going to put this on my
waterline to make me look a little bit
more awake now I am aware you can't get
this in Superdrug or boots however a
very good group would be the Maybelline
big eye pencil but I don't have that at
the moment so this is why I'm using this
one so for this look I'm not going to go
with any eye shadow I'm just going to go
in with some mascara so I'm going to
alternate between two mascara today and
this is going to be the Maybelline lash
sensational and they bourgeois body in
one second these two are very they make
your lashes very long black so if you're
looking for a more natural one maybe go
with Maybelline the rocket but I'm
looking for going for the big long
luscious black flashes so these are the
two most guys are going to be using
just gonna brush through my eyebrows
because I don't want to fill them in on
anything for school I just want to make
sure that all brushed through and they
look not as messy
okay now finally for lips you're
probably expecting me to their baby lips
of course you can use that but I wanted
to be able to make a bit different so
I'm gonna be using the Loreal I'm using
a little more oil in this make look the
collection exclusive by Julianne because
this is the best lipstick ever it's so
so natural is just a past elite rosy
pink and I think this one is perfect for
school so I really hope you enjoyed this
video let me know if you did by giving
it a huge thumbs up and let me know what
makeup you were going to wear down below
or what don't you go back to school
anything school related or anything
random related so I hope you enjoyed the
video and I will see you a next one bye
