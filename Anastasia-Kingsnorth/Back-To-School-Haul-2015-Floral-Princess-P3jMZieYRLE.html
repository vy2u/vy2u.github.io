going to be doing my long-awaited
back-to-school supplies haul so I
actually started my youtube channel
around back-to-school time last year and
I've been wanting to do a proper back to
school series ever since I did it last
year and I'm so excited that it is
finally that time to do it again if you
do want to go see all of my all back to
school videos I think I did school
morning routine a haul I did a beauty
haul for school if you want to go see
those that all at the bottom of my
channel and I will also link a link to
little playlist in the description box
so make sure you go check them because
they are literally fetus Anastasia so in
this video I'm going to be showing you
my bag shoes beauty and stationery
things that I picked up fall back to
school because I just prefer to get it
all done early so then I can make videos
for you and hopefully give you ideas on
what you could get so I hope you're
doing video and let's get started so I'm
actually just going to start off with my
say for me and if I keep looking down
it's because I have it all down here so
I'm going to start off with the basics
pencils so I just got the stellar 5 pack
of pencils
I prefer get instead of the pencils
because I know they're going to be good
quality schools sometimes happen that
our school we just have to bring them
with us so yeah these are the ones I get
you get a to be a bah-bah and a 2h so
they're perfect view if you're doing art
as well so I definitely recommend
getting these pencils because you can
notice a difference between these
pencils and other pencils I then also
got this pack of paper mate ink joy pens
you get eight of them and they have
little hearts on the notes which I
thought were really adorable but these
were only a pound from tesco and these
are amazing pens they last absolutely
ages so to be fair with this pack it
will probably get you through the year
so definitely recommend getting
something like this I then just got the
helix Oxford pencil sharpener so this
one is just like little circle shape and
it has two holes to sharpen everything
with it has a big hole for like maybe
thicker pencils and then a smaller hole
for like writing pencils so this is
perfect
and because it is in like little tin you
don't have to go to the bin to sharpen
your pencil I then just have this helix
oxford ruler and by the way a pencil
sharpener was only a pound so always
heal itself is actually pretty
and then I got this helix reactor 50p
and all of this is from Tesco and it's
basically a folding ruler so it will fit
in my pencil case perfectly and it is a
30 centimeter one so it's basically
perfect for school I definitely
recommend getting folding rulers over
thee just smaller rulers because one you
can put them into a pencil case and two
you won't have to say if you're drawing
something out a lot bigger move your
ruler across you can just open it out
and you have it here so I definitely
recommend getting something like this I
then just have a helix Oxford pack of
two rubbers so these were 75 P as well
from Tesco and they are very big rubbers
and they are good rubbers you can
definitely tell the difference between
these rubbers and a lot of other rubbers
because some rubbers they leave marks
Alex leave color and it doesn't look
price but these rubbers are incredible
to get something like this if you are
going to get rubbers because I just
think they're much better and because
you get two it will last you literally
probably all year I then got the helix
Oxford set of mathematical instrument
it's basically a like attractor set so
just comes in this little tin here and
you just open it up and it has like a
ton of stuff inside so it comes of like
this little stencil thing it comes with
a school timetable it comes with a bunch
of different protractors it also comes
with a compass a sharpener a pencil a 15
centimeter ruler and a brother as well
and this was only a pound again from
Tesco so honestly you definitely need to
go and check out Tesco because all of
their stuff is on offer at the moment
and it is incredible because normally
these are about 4 or 5 pounds to buy so
to get all of that for a pound bargain I
then just picked up a print stick so
this one is the power glue it's a
syllable one I always find that the
normal protocol esit my work down and
again cheaper glue never sticks I work
down so you know what I just gave in it
was only 75 P I don't know why Tesco
stuff is always so cheap at the moment
but it's just the pretty stick power
glue and yeah I got this amazing I then
just picked up this pack of Sharpie fluo
extra large highlighters so you get four
of them you get a yellow one a pink
quite an orange one and a green one
there's two me guys so they won't to me
your pen when you put them over them and
they are extra long length nibs as well
so it will definitely highlight all of
your words no matter how big your
handwriting is so I'm probably just
going to take
maybe two of them at a time I'll
probably take the pink and the yellow
first for the first house of the year
and then for the second half of the year
I'll probably just take the green and
the orange and these are two pounds I
believe so these are the most expensive
things out of the whole set of station
robot which I was pretty surprised about
but I think they're going to be really
good and especially because I'm going
into year ten I'm going to need to
highlight a lot of my work I finally
then got these Crayola pack of twelve
color pencils these again what a pal
from Tesco and it positive twelve
different colors it comes with basically
all of the basic colors I actually can't
even get it open it comes with a white
eight Brown like a dark red a red orange
yellow green dark green blue light blue
black and purple so basically every
color you need other than pink which is
a bit sad but yeah for a peridot that
you can go wrong and I think they're
perfect because Crayola Color and
pencils don't need like any smudges like
it colors it all straight so you can't
see through it which I really like and
yes actually we're doing art this year
could you Jesse I thought it would be
helpful for my pencil case I decided
just to go with a clear one because I
wanted just to be able to see what I
have in here this is just from paper
trays and it was one pound seven four
five I was going to get one from
Wilkinsons but I feel like sometimes
they're not as good quality and for a
little bit more you can get a better
quality one so I just got this clear
pencil case and it is really big as well
so it should hold a lot of message from
Ray he's are also from Paper Chase it
was a three for to offer so I decided to
pick up some folders so I just picked up
this folder here and this folder they're
basically the same folder but different
sizes and they are see-through like this
so I thought that I would get this one
for like homework or little pieces of
paper and then this one for like
different coursework bits and everything
like that I thought there'd be a lot
more handy to keep in my bags and just
chucking it in because I like to keep
all of my schoolwork nice so these were
I think this one was like one pound and
this one was like 50 P but I've got this
one free because it was a FIFA to offer
with my pencil case so yeah I really
really like this and I'm really happy
with these I wanted some clear ones and
these are a lot better quality then you
will get in a lot of other shops so
again definitely recommend going to
Paper Chase for things like this I then
picked up an actual pair
so these are from Paper Chase as well
but they weren't in the food to offer
they're just silver with a clear handle
and then just have this little case on I
thought this would be handy because it's
school sometimes the teachers don't
always have enough scissors and
sometimes you have to wait so I've
thought it'd be better if I have my own
pair so then I can just do it straight
away
and start off with my work and I think
these are one-pound 75 of course you
could get cheaper ones I like the color
of them so I decided to get these ones
now I'm just going to do a few beauty
bits that I picked up so I first of all
picked up a do drew this is a roll-on
deodorant
it's a Garnier mineral invisible 48-hour
so obviously I haven't used it I'm
saving it for school so I don't know
what it's going to be like and it was
only a pound and I thought it'd be handy
to keep in my bag I then licked up a
pack of towels just to keep in my bag
because you never know and then I just
have this little beauty bag so the bag
itself is actually from H&amp;amp;M and it was
only $1.99 and it's just this cute
little
toiletry type bag and in it I actually
keep a mini lint roller which I got from
H&amp;amp;M it was 99 p42 you just got a refill
but it was spotty and I wanted to use
the floral one and it just comes on this
little pink handle and it fits perfectly
in the bag so I always find I get to
school and I have fluff on me so I
thought that would be perfect I then
picked up some superdrug shine control
sheets because if you know me
aka poppy and Amir I always ask them for
their oil blotting sheets so I just
sided pick up my own this year because I
genuinely need them so bad because my
skin is very very oily these are
actually like one of the most expensive
things I've got I think they work to
pound 69 I then also picked up a new
Rimmel stay matte powder and a
collection lasting perfection concealer
because I'm going to be using these in
the morning then I'm literally just
going to pop them in the bag do it up
and I'm ready to go so just in case I
need to top up throughout the day I have
all of it they're ready okay so now on
to my shoes and then I'm going to show
you my bag so for shoes I think it's
very important to get one with a good
soul because if you like me last year I
just got someone trim like Asda at the
start of the year and they literally
didn't last two months honestly I think
I spent about 60 pounds on school shoes
in the end
because I just didn't get good ones at
the beginning I think if you get good
ones at the beginning they will last a
lot longer and it's just much more worth
the money so I decided to go stop shop
because I figured that Topshop would
have some really nice ones so these ones
are just these kind of Brophy type ones
so they were 30 pounds over 29 so I
thought did you think that was bad
that's all that was cheap for Topshop
they just have this very very solid so
it is very solid and it just is topped
up in here and I basically have this
little snake skinny type pattern here
and then they just have the ladies with
little gold picks on and submits a shiny
and some bits are a little bit matte
which I liked and yeah I just thought
these were really nice and as soon as I
saw them I definitely had to get them I
really liked them and finally for my bag
so my bag just looks like this it is the
H&amp;amp;M black tote bag and it is huge look
at that is absolutely huge it's made my
lighting goal weird but this was meant
to be 40 pounds and it was not down to
30 pounds it just has a long strap here
two gold bits here and it has so many
compartments inside I am redoing a
what's in my school bag as well in my
next videos so if you want to prop it in
depth overlays look watch that video
that was everything that I picked up
before back to school I really hope you
enjoy this video I actually enjoyed
filming it so much and I'm actually
really happy with it throw it up if you
want more back to school videos and let
me know if you're excited to go back to
school in the comments and let me know
what date you go back as well because
I'm interested I love you all so much
and I will see you soon bye
