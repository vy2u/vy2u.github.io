so much to learn no I will not tempt me
not tempt me my phone to get whatever I
get you know everybody
so for today's video I am back with my
first ever back to school video of 2016
so I know for some reason I've started
off on my back to school videos before
I've even like broke up from school and
that is because I have a lot of like
other videos that I want to upload this
summer like traveling videos and some
videos because I haven't been on holiday
abroad for a long long time but I would
definitely watch it on YouTube so I
haven't been able to do like any like
traveling videos so I'm really excited
that I can finally do those this year
for you guys because I know you want
them see I wanted to kick off my back to
school season with them back to school
life hacks because I haven't went to
school shopping yet but I will be doing
a school supplies haul next Sunday so
make sure you come back to my channel
for that I want to kick it off with some
life hacks just to like it and rend your
life hack some revision life hacks and
dren general general general school life
hacks and just everything like that
really that is going to help you get
through the next year of school so yeah
I'm just going to get straight into it
I really hope enjoy the video and let's
get started so life hack number 1 is
quite a simple one and these are like
getting ready life hacks because I know
that in the morning sometimes you wake
up lay or you just don't have enough
time sometimes that happens to me like
not all the time but sometimes it does
so I've come up with some hacks and
found some hacks online that you could
use and I'm gonna share so hack number
one is using a timed playlist so make a
playlist on Spotify on YouTube whatever
you feel like making it on and do it for
the exact amount of time you have
to get ready because if you have a set
amount of time your musically playing
for you know that you have to be out the
door when it finishes so you can just
kind of like keep go like you know how
long you have left but what song you put
next and it's just an easier way than a
timer because you're freeing a motivated
way but the music but then you also know
that you've only got like five minutes
have to get ready so that's always a
nice little hack to know yeah
line hack number two is again using your
phone and if you have trouble waking up
I occasionally have trouble waking up I
mean I woke up a half five which I know
is ridiculous but you guys will see why
in my school morning routine which I
would do this year but yeah I wake up so
early so unnecessary but I do it if you
do have trouble waking up I would
definitely recommend setting an alarm
every minute so ten minutes before you
need to get up for every single minute
and put your phone away from you because
by doing this you're going to have to
get up out of bed to turn them off and
you want to get ready for straightest
and you can't just like snuggle and your
duvet go back to sleep because the
alarms are constantly going to be going
off so it was constantly set an alarm
for like 10-15 minutes and move your
phone right away from your reach then
you will get up I've used this one
before and this one is actually really
effective because I get so frustrated I
hear the alarms I just cannot go back to
bed after because the noise is just
ringing in my head life hack number
three I really really really like this
one because it's like the simplest thing
ever but it's actually really effective
and all it is is keeping all of your
school makeup in one place by doing this
I don't really know why it's effective
but it just saves time in the morning
because obviously I saw makeup in my
annex drawers and like I still have like
five different drawers of makeup so I
have to kind of like go through the farm
what I'm going to use for that day and
it's just a lot harder than having it
all in one place so I'm investing like a
little box or like a tray or a dish or
something I just have a little box and
I'll just put all of your everyday
school makeup in that so then when you
get ready in the morning you litter you
can just pick up your brushes and then
just open this box and all of your
makeup is there is saves a lot of time
and it's just easier to find your makeup
when you know all where it is and then
I'm
so you can put it back on like a Friday
night or something and then just put it
back in the box
on a Sunday night so have your number
four is a rainbow highlighter now this
is kind of like a DIY and a hack in the
same way I suppose all you need to do is
get a highlighter color of your choice I
told yellow because it's the lightest
color so on the tip of the highlighter
the yellow one too the first one that
we're going to use take another
highlighter and like blend it into the
tip so just hold it onto the tip so
holding like tip to tip but don't hold
them fully tip to tip I'm really bad
explaining things oh my god you will see
by the overlay but just hold it on a
little bit of the tip so the ink sinks
down and do that again on the other side
you've like a blue highlighter so then
you'll have like a rainbow highlighter
which will be yellow pink and blue and
this is a really good hat just to
highlight things that you generally need
to remember all your highlighting can
actually lead to forgetting because you
just get so like excited about
highlighting that you just highlight
everything and not just the important
things if you just ran by highlighter
just four important things they will go
in using the three colors together are
proven to actually increase your memory
and you will remember whatever you
highlight with it purely because you're
using three colors and because you find
it quite interesting to look at those
colors and I don't know you're like you
get your brain excited so yeah I would
definitely try that I try that on my
science because obviously there's a lot
to know for science especially GTC
science so our new triple so I have to
know a lot as well so that is a really
big hack and I've started using that and
I love it the next life hat is using
Google Scholar and this is basically
like instead of using Google type in
Google Scholar and click on that and
then use that search engine because
sometimes if you're using normal Google
you could type something in you get away
too much information or the complete
wrong information if you go on Google
Scholar it's all like school and
education related so say if you search
for Shakespeare on Google Scholar you'd
get more the relative stuff that you
need instead of like the stuff you got
on Google it's a really good hacker
student and I use this and it definitely
saves me a lot of time when I'm doing
homework because I can just get straight
to the point of whatever I need
the next hack is probably my favorite
hack but it could get addictive so I
wouldn't necessarily recommend it it
could get really addictive I wouldn't
necessarily recommend it for a long time
but it is really good hack so hack
number six is using gummy bears to study
this is so random you're probably
thinking what but this is such a good
hack and this is like a revision life
hack so what you want to do is open your
textbook or your notebook wherever you
have all of your vision in and on each
paragraph for each section put down a
gummy bear or a sweet of your choice so
then as you read that paragraph you can
eat that sweet and it will motivate you
especially if you really like that thing
that you place down to read more but you
can only eat it once you've like
memorized it and send it back to
yourself it's a good motivational
technique but as I said I wouldn't
recommend doing it all the time because
then you can start comfort eating we're
gonna need two things that you don't
really want to happen so I wouldn't do
that all the time but it's a nice treat
to do once in a while when you are
revising hack number seven is actually a
really really effective one and it's
something really simple but it really
does work and is revising before bed
it's actually scientifically proven that
you remember more things that you find
out before you go to bed then you will
during the day I'm not exactly sure why
but it is proven so I actually started
doing this when I had my year 10 lakhs a
few weeks ago and it worked like the
things that I didn't really understand I
went through it at night and in the
morning I recited it back to myself and
it worked this is really really really
good and just do it right before you go
to bed so you're so tired but it will go
in like online it works me maybe it does
for you I hope it does because it was
really really good okay a life hack
number
okay so life hack number eight is
probably one of a 1 because it's so
funny like I don't know why but it does
work and it is sleeping on your books
you're probably thinking oh my god you
have to be serious sleeping on my books
yeah I'm being serious this works like
put your books are underneath your
pillows and then just go to sleep I'll
do this is like the revision guys you
can get I'm not sure what ran that vibe
yeah I do that with my revision guides
and are going to sleep put them in my
bed and I just feel like I haven't
forgotten anything like it's all like in
my brain I don't know it's so weird but
just try it like you don't even have to
do if it's cool just try it with
anything that you want to remember just
sleep on it and you're going to go so
that was the end of my school life hacks
video I really really really hope you
enjoyed it let me know if you did by
giving it a huge thumbs up and make sure
you smash that thumbs up button as well
to let me know you want me to do more
school videos because I love doing two
cool videos like I don't know a badger
school seeing is basically my favorite
season on YouTube but yeah I love it all
so much I hope you are having an amazing
summer even though I haven't broken up
yet but I hope you will have an amazing
summer and I will see you next Sunday
with my back to school supply store to
come at 10 a.m. okay I love you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
