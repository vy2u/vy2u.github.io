the head Japanese today I'm going to be
doing it my back to school supply tool
for summer 2014 so for some reason this
has been really really requested and I'm
not really sure why because I don't find
it that interesting to get stationary
but now I think about it it's going to
be quite fun to film this haul because
I'm actually really happy with the stuff
that I got this year but there's a
couple of things I'm missing I don't
have a folder or a pencil case yet and
that is because I've ordered them off
the cascade stone website and they
haven't came yet but yeah I'm probably
going to have to put those in my what's
in my school bag which is going to be
coming in the next couple of days do you
have all of my school supplies in my
school bag like just here but I'm not
going to show you want my school bag is
just yet because as I said already doing
or what's in my school bag in the next
couple of days so I kind of don't want
me to see like my school bag yet but you
will see it very soon but if you want to
see the school supplies that I got then
carry on what just off with the absolute
basics and they just end so I just got a
pack of 24 from Poundland because I
don't know how good they're going to be
but you got 24 and I'd like these like
pens with the with it I just get along
really well with like writing with them
and stuff oh wait you get 26 you get to
3x townland 26 tens in there and then I
just picked up a bit better quality ones
to take as well which I'll probably take
first eaters backups and these are the
BIC crystal medium one yeah they were
pounds and I'm not really sure how much
they were but they're like 115 got a
ruler but I wanted to get like a folder
ruler like what you can fold down and I
got this in WH Smiths it was about 2
pounds I think and it's just a pink
helix one and yeah it falls down and got
some pencils because obviously you need
pencils and this is just the stapler or
Stadler I'm not sure how you say it set
and you get five really good quality
pencils in it with a sharpener and a
rubber I want you to sharp no because I
don't know well nearly hit myself in the
face with it for first videos don't
really like it and but yeah I've got
those in there about two pounds from
Asda I then had to get another
calculator because basically I chopped
away my old school bag and stupidly I
left my calculator which is pink so I
really like
in the bag and I didn't realize until
like I was like oh I'll get my hair
clear out and then I realized I chucked
it away and these are like don't want to
pay like 10 pounds for this and we have
to have this calculator so my mom was a
bit annoyed but yeah I really really
liked it it's easy to use because I I'll
teach you shout out and stuff but yeah
so I've got that Casio calculator I then
decided to get like this really cute
notebook because I figured I'm gonna
need notebooks not necessarily for
lessons because we get a book for each
lesson and we get given a planner but
just in case I have to like write
anything down Lord think video ideas and
you think and this was only like 50 P
from home bargains and I'm absolutely
loving the retro pattern of it so I got
that then picked up some colors and
these are just a cruller 24 pack of
colored pencils I was going to get 12
pack but I figured that a 24 pack would
kind of be better because you get a much
bigger range of colors and yeah I didn't
have that many colors last year so I
started to get those this year and these
are like one pound fifty in US then just
got a protractor and a compass set and
this is a powerful master because I
figured I'd need one of these but like
the protractor is really really big so
I'm gonna like get a mini one to keep my
pencil case and kind of just possibly
keep that home and take it what I need I
then got a water bottle and this is the
Systema twisted sick ones because the
long said this would be really good just
to like keep in there and stuff so I
decided to get that I wanted to get the
ones like an ice cube down the middle
but they didn't have that and I think
beginning like everything from Asda but
I promise I didn't but this one's from
as doing this is like two pounds not now
from like four so pretty cheap for that
and then picked up this for Divya Smith
and this is a bit correction fluid
because I kind of go wrong sometimes in
my work so like and I don't like to
leave it messy so I kind of just like to
like tip exit out how many times did I
say like then so I got that and that was
a pound now actually got this thing and
I got this and I went for Oxford
violently I showed it and it's a
macaroon rubber like I'm absolutely in
love with this like so so much it was
like 1 pound 10 from a shop called
weightless enter this is card blot and
they did like loads of different colors
and stuff and I really really wanted it
so I decided to pick that up but of
course I got the pink one you can like
take it apart and stuff but thought that
was so cute and like
like rock the macaroons at school and
then picked up a pack of helix erasers
because I don't really need like any
decent colored erasers just get plain
ones and these are just like too and
they were like not allowed to 50p nazhde
and i really really like these because
they're really big and yeah helix race
is a good this isn't necessarily a
supply but I thought I'd include it
anyway because I've got this from Oxford
as well and these just some catechists
and tissues which I just keep in my bag
because I kind of got a matching pencil
case to this it kind of matches but yeah
I wanted everything to match so I got
those and the final thing I got for my
supplies is my favorite thing ever and
it is a sharpie set and I got this for
seven pounds so when you bought
something from WH Smith what did I get
when I bought this for two pounds the
ruler you got this for seven pounds and
my mum was are all you don't need
sharpies yeah I do
they come with pastel colors pink and
mint green what is life turning into I'm
so so so happy with these like I'm
getting really sido sharpies but love
them so that is all of the supplies I
got for school if you would like to see
like a school beauty haul then I will do
one of those for you as well because I
have the stuff to do that and I'm also
doing a Primark haul so thanks for
watching guys don't look if you enjoyed
and don't forget subscribe the head
trouble getting now on but when it comes
to you I'm never good enough</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
