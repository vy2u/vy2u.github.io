going to be the Jelly Belly bean boozled
challenge so I am NOT in one usual
setting I've changed it around a bit and
I'm with my best friend amber because I
thought I would film with her and I got
this my birthday and so many of you
requested it so I thought I would do it
eight different flavors but we're only
doing six because there was only like
yeah we could because we made some
already there was only like one left of
the baby wipes and there was none left
of the long trip until I'm but there's
eight different ones or maybe we're
doing six so we're gonna be doing stinky
socks or tutti-fruitti rotten egg or
buttered popcorn vomit or peach booger
or juicy pear toothpaste or berry blue
and canned dog food or chocolate pudding
and basically you get one - Laver or one
horrible flavor but they both look the
same or me being already nice oh we
could both get the same you could both
get a nice and we could both get nasty
but the aim of the game is the person
with the most nice one so you get a
point for each nice one yeah first thing
that we decided to do was can dog food
or chocolate pudding we've done this
before and I got chocolate pudding and
I'm about to end all food in a time all
the time but you ready - oh it's karma
that was discussed as well so amber got
a point on that one because she caught
the nice one so because my breath stinks
we decided to do berry blue or
toothpaste but we actually don't know I
think I'm so sick after that right
you've done this one before it's done
this one before I had to face doesn't
taste that toothpaste but
ready 3 2 1 go Oh
okay none of us got a point for that one
even though it was nice because you only
get a point of it very big hey not much
to knock you out the none of us got a
point on that one so in the moment an
opinion yeah as usual but basically now
we're gonna do tutti frutti or stinky
socks I'm Rachel I've done this before
