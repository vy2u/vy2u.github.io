beauty collective hold I'm aware that
it's just being Christmas but I went to
the Boxing Day sales and I've recently
just gotten a few shopping trips so I
wanted to show you what I picked up I'm
not trying to brag about in any way you
know that I'm just purely showing you
what I've got and I hope you enjoy it in
the past in day sales they were doing a
major lien fee for to offer and you got
a free baby lips I think that offer was
running before Christmas but every boots
I went to I couldn't find the free baby
lips and then in my town I actually
finally found it
so I decided to pick up like three
things and then I got one free and they
all just dropped on the floor um but the
first thing I picked up was the
Maybelline rocket mascara so I
personally never had one of these in my
own makeup collection it was my mum's I
always used and the one is just
incredible like it I'm wearing it today
and it just makes my lashes just like go
around it's just amazing I seriously
recommend this mascara and this was
eight pounds and then got the Maybelline
big eyes double ended eyeliner so I have
the big eyes mascara and I just thought
this looked a really good like thing to
go with it so it has a co-op black liner
and a cold white liner which I haven't
actually opened yet oh there we go so
I'm really excited to use this and yeah
it looks amazing
and then got a maybelline color drama
intensive velvet lip pencil and this one
is in the shade wonderful zero
minimalist so it's just a very matte
pink color and I feel like I don't wear
enough Pink's on my lips I tend to go
for Mattie Mattie on earth or word like
darker colors in the winter and very
light colors I don't think I wear enough
colors like this so I kind of reminded
me of Kylie Jenner so I got that and
then for free I got this Maybelline
doctor risky baby lifts in very soft and
recently they've actually brought out
like the whole range of these rescue
like Cole crave a mint one a peach one
they've just bought them all out so
they'll probably bring up the crystal
ones next but yeah so I got that for
free and haven't even opened it yet
why are on the topic of fame lips I
actually bought myself a baby it's
crystal so I got this from the American
can Amazon because I saw this selling on
eBay or Amazon for 1,100 pounds and I
decided to go on to the American Amazon
and I found the last one for four pounds
50 and they actually shipped it to
England so I find that American Baby
Lips are so much more moisturizing and
just a so much more better than English
baby lips if you ever have the chance to
get these definitely try them whilst I
was on the American Amazon I also picked
up another couple of things so I first
of all picked up the Maybelline the
nudes eyeshadow palette so when this
came out in America I desperately wanted
it but obviously it only came out in
America then I discovered obviously the
American Amazon that they delivered to
England on certain products and I got
this so it comes with 12 different
eyeshadow colors very similar to the
Naked 2 palette but they're all so
pigmented I still tethered like the tape
ayat because it's just such an amazing
palette but I have used it multiple
times
and it's amazing it just comes with
loads of different eye lips like this
set out so you do those two together
those two those three those three it's
just a really amazing palette and it was
only eight pounds final thing I got from
the American Amazon was the Milani brow
fix brow kit so I'm actually really
getting my eyebrows waxed by the time
you see this they possibly would have
been done so if you don't see them in
the next couple of videos because
they're probably gonna be pre-filmed
they yeah my brows waxed
finally so I'm gonna start to like do
stuff with my eyebrows because so many
people mention them to me and I just
keep putting it off but I'm actually
gonna go and do it so yeah I decided to
get this and this is the lightest shade
and it comes with a palette brush
angled brush tweezers highlight for our
one a brow 2 and some different eyebrow
techniques I've also recently been
picking up a few nail polishes so I
decided to pick up two new ones first
one I picked up was from Maybelline and
this is a Maybelline Color show by color
drama and this is a 2 to 8 called cool
touch this is just a very light toned
gray and amber water grey on her nails
and I thought it looks stunning so I
just had to pick up one of these and
yeah I got that I then picked up a very
dark road and this is from the berry MJ
high shine range which is my favorite
and this is in 33 Chile so I'm not
wearing this now I thought it was right
but I'm gonna put mine out of this after
this video because I loved it and it was
only four pounds it also recently has
picked up two new foundation so one from
Amazon and one from super drug so from
Amazon I picked up the Bourjois healthy
mix serum again I have never had a
bourgeois foundation in my makeup
collection my mum has it that is why it
was worked quite dark for me because my
mom has darker toned skin than me
this is this theorem and this is in like
the lightest shade vanilla number 52
vanilla yeah and I haven't actually used
this yet so I don't know my opinion on
it because it actually only came a
couple of days ago so when I do use this
I'll let you know how I like it or if I
don't like it but pretty sure I'm gonna
like it in the Box today sales
L'Oreal had quite a big sale on it by
Superdrug and this foundation called the
nude magique dude I'm really bad at
pronouncing paris names yeah I've got
this for five pounds so this is the
Loreal Foundation and I've had my eye on
this for ages
I actually saw me and Malik from
Instagram and usually of how you to is
amazing please go and check it out I saw
her have this I think she called it for
Christmas last year I Carmen burr and I
really really wanted it and I just never
bought myself to buy it and then when I
saw it I was just like I've gotta get it
so I got that so yes let you know how I
like that I forgot I picked up another
couple of things from Amazon as you can
tell I'm a very big Amazon shopper so
the first thing I got was a Rimmel stay
blushed liquid cheek tint so I've been
looking at these for ages but I've never
bought them and I saw these for one
pound fifty on there and this is a zero
zero four Sunkist cherry so it's just a
very dark like peachy red so you just
put it on and you just blend it like
that and it looks really nice on the
cheeks and I'm actually wearing this
today it's like it kind of a little bit
patchy but if you blend it a lot it's
really good it promises it's the final
thing I picked off of Amazon it is and
this is the EOS at hand lotion in
strawberry pomegranate something
something along those lines and I've
been loving this lots of people
recommend you blooming the green one but
I'm a pink girl like look everywhere a
pink girl for stuff like this so yeah I
picked up the pink one and so far I'm
loving it the final thing I've actually
picked up for my
is a high-end item and I haven't bought
one of these in ages and this is a matte
lipstick so I felt like a treat was
overdue like a Christmas treat from me
from me to me so I thought I would buy a
matte lipstick so this is the color I'm
wearing today from very far back it
looks very matte and then from like
quite a close it looks shiny so I really
like it and this is the matte lipstick
it's amplified and it's called brick
Cola so it's just this gorgeous
darky red Brown it's very brownie tone
and very red toned but it's definitely a
brick color I can see why they named it
that it's definitely a type of bricky
color but I really like it on my lips I
can like overdrawn lips with it because
you can't see your natural lip line I
don't even know what I'm going on
anymore but yeah I really like this and
I got this in the sale for something
like thirteen fifty because it was ten
percent off I'm gonna show you things
that I've actually been bought for me so
I have Amber's Christmas present here
she actually got me three lush items but
I've actually used them so I can't show
you them but she got me dashing sounds a
bath bomb candy mountain bubble bar and
melting snowman bath now what she also
got me chocolate but again I can't show
you that because I've ate them but the
first thing she got me it was this and
this is a Yankee Candle medium jar in
fire side treats so if you weren't going
to do a Christmas present opening video
but I didn't really like how it turned
out because it was so funny but the
lighting just kept going weird and I
just wanted it to be amazing so instead
I thought I'd shove it in a hole but if
you want like need to tell you what I've
got hired then I think I'll include it
in a haul it would probably do a joint
Hawkes doing I don't know something like
that but this smells amazing
it's just gorgeous I love this thank you

Glory item so this is the whipped clean
shower butter and she knows I wanted
