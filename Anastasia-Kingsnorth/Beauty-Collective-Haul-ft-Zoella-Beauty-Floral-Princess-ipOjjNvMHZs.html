to be a huge beauty collective haul so
I'm not lying when I say huge there's
honestly so much stuff to go through but
I've done a haul in about two months and
I have obviously done that Liddy's swap
box in that time I've been to Milton
Keynes
and I have been getting a lot of future
point two gift cards so I'm just wanna
start off by saying I'm not trying to
brag or boast in any way shape or form
I'm honestly so grateful for all of this
and I'm aware that it is quite a few
hundred pounds but I am so grateful and
I probably only bought with my own money
ten percent of it so I don't say thank
you to everybody who got me something
even if you did and nearly swap box and
yeah and future points as well because
I've been very nice to me and I we were
doing the featurepoints video in the
next week but anyway I'm just going to
stop babbling now and that's just came
so I'm going to start off with you
making pallets I have received so I'm so
grateful for all of these because I
didn't actually buy any of them myself
they were all given to me so the naked
one was given to me by my nan and she
just decided to buy it for me because I
don't get to see her that often and yeah
she's started to pick this up for me so
thank you so so much
and then Lily in a swap box decided to
get me these two and she got me the
Naked 3 and the naked basics the naked 3
is not my most favorite palette ever my
intagram is found with pictures of this
so if you want to come and see those a
bit to this to check out my Instagram
I'm absolutely so grateful for all of
these pallets and I cannot thank you
enough the colors in this are just
amazing and yes so thank you so much to
everybody who got me these next range of
things are benefit and some of them I
bought myself and some of them literally
got me so I'm just gonna start off with
the two things I got myself so on Amazon
they were having a huge sale on benefit
for like one night I think and this was
a 10 pound and this is the benefit of
raised paste and I got this from a
future point gift card and this is just
a
it's all in there and oh my god I cannot
oh I love this concealer so much this is
in number one fair and I also decided to
get myself the rockatuer blush because I
wanted to try benefit Brock's blush for
ages and can we just take a look at how
amazing this color is it's just stunning
I'm not the biggest fan on the Lazy
packaging but I still absolutely love it
and then Lily also got me some benefit
things and I wasn't expecting this much
benefit off of her so thank you so so
much so she got me some lip products so
first of all she got me Poti Barb and
this is amazing I just love it so much
it's such a gorgeous passingly pinkie
bomb and it just smells amazing too and
I really want to collect all these so
she got me that and then she also got me
the travel first-class glosses and you
just get Bella bamboo coral Easter
dandelion and sugar bomb and I'm such a
fan of the packaging on this as well
it's just stunning and she got me that a
nice walk box so thank you so much she
also got me another three benefit things
she got me the benefit of high brow the
hello flawless oxygen well foundation
and the full-size of the pore fessional
like I cannot thank her enough I
absolutely love all of these benefit
things and I'm so excited to try them I
kept them all in the boxes because I'm
gonna be getting money makeup storage
and I kind of wanted to be exciting when
I had to unbox everything but yeah thank
you so much really
Lily also got me some bare minerals and
Mac so Frank bare minerals she got me
the buxom gloss and she's heard quite a
bit about these I personally haven't but
they are really really nice it's just a
gorgeous dark pink color and I'm very
excited to try that it's my first
bareMinerals product and she also picked
me up three Mac things so she got me the
MAC lipstick and it's a frost lipstick
and she got me this in angel I know have
three of them but a lot of three angels
but like three MAC lipsticks and this
color is just gorgeous
I oh I love it so much and she knew I
really wanted angel and this is one of
the first things she got me actually and
she also picked me up a mac lipglass
and this is just in Russian bread and I
absolutely love this as well it's just
amazing thank you so much and then she
also picked me off a Mac blush which
I just wow it is so so nice and this is
in dolly mix and the color and the
pigmentation of this is just so nice
it's like a gorgeous already pinky color
and the swatches of this at just
beautiful has gorgeous Goldy undertones
and I love it the next thing Lily got me
was the route techniques so these are
just some of my favorites out the one
she got me she got me the sponge and the
blush brush and the cool collection so
this is the blush brush this brush is
gorgeous it's like perfect it's so so
soft and then this is the sponge I'm
using this for foundation at the moment
and I love it
it's just so good I don't know if you
have to respond these let me know in the
comments if you know and then this is
the contour brush in the core collection
but as you can see it's already kind of
dirty because I've been using this in my
concealer and these three are now my
favorite brushes ever so now all of the
high-end makeup is out of the way I
thought I would do skincare and then
drugstore so I've picked up two skincare
things so the first thing is the Garnier
essentials Rose cream I think it's
called and I don't have the box anymore
but this is an amazing cream I've
honestly noticed such a difference in my
skin since I've been using this as my
skin gets so dry in the winter and I
only ever pick these things up when
they're on offer and it's just on offer
for two pounds in Tesco so I would
definitely recommend that and then Lily
also got me some Bioderma
which oh my gosh I love this stuff I've
only used it like about five times and
it's barely got down any so I could tell
this but I was the last me ages and if
you don't know what this is it's
basically a copy of the Garnier micellar
solution and but the Garnier was kind of
a copy of this but yeah it's just
exactly like that but I think it's way
way better while shopping in Milton
Keynes I've decided to go into super
drugged with lily and amber and
everybody else who came and we found her
Ella beauty and I got some so I got the
savanna beauty let's glow candle and
this smells so fresh like my mum doesn't
like it but I actually really like this
scent and this is five pounds
and then I picked up the fierce bar
because there wasn't much left like
there was nothing left on the shelf and
then we asked them to go and get some
more if they had any and they were like
oh yeah we'll bring some out with
everybody just screamed and crowded
round the shop assistant and emptied all
of the boxes they had so I was very
lucky to manage to get these and e25
pound each and yeah this is just a
fragrant bath fizzes square thingies but
all smells the same and I love the scent
of it recently I've also been getting
quite a bit of Nicks so the first thing
was sent to me from a viewer called
Phoebe you actually came to Milton
Keynes shopping with us and she got me
the NYX natural natural palette and this
is just a gorgeous array of dark toned
colors perfect for the autumn and I've
never seen this palette before like
anywhere so when she sent it to me I was
so so happy and I would absolutely love
this no idea how much it was but thank
you so much Mimi forget I mean that and
Lily also got me a couple of things she
got me a Russian like red tiger lipstick
gloss thing but I don't have that on me
at the moment but she also got me a
blush in rose garden and I've wanted
this for the longest time as well and to
pick this up in Milton Keynes for me and
it's just such a stunning color so so
happy when she got me that and then I
also picked up two things for myself
so this thing which is the NYX jumbo eye
pencil in strawberry milk I went to look
for Americans but they didn't have it
and my mum actually ordered it for me
and I was so happy when she said she got
me it and it's just a stunning pastel
pink color this and the milk one is my
favorite and then I also got a NYX
butter gloss in Maple blondie and I just
really like the kind of this haven't
heard much about it but I thought it
looked really good next thing I got for
myself was the wet and wild walking on
eggshells color trio got loose off
Amazon for six pounds including postage
of packaging which is amazing because we
don't live in America well I don't
anyway and you just get a brown bone
color a crease color an eyelid color I
don't love how it says what each one is
for and then you get two brushes and
other thing I love about this palette is
you get one like one of those brushes
which I personally hate what you get
with like pretty much every pie I think
you know once I mean like the padded
ones but you also get like a fluffy
crease brush which i think is so good
because these are like a pound like
obviously had to pay more but if you go
to America they're like too
so I got that and Lily also picked me up
some Sephora things which I forgot to
mention so she got me these two Sephora
shower gel she actually got me three but
I've used an already and they just look
like this and then these gorgeous little
spotty things and I'm gonna be taking
these on holiday with me when I go in
November with amber we're going to great
yarmouth for four days and I'm gonna be
taking those and she also got me a lip
gloss and this is in 15 cute pink
shimmery and I haven't had a chance to
try this out yet because of how much
makeup I've been trying to use but it's
just a gorgeous pink and it smells
really good too so thank you for getting
me that I now have quite a bit of
drugstore to show you so I actually have
four baby lips so Lily got me two of
them she got me the orange because I
thought it was the one I needed to
finish my collection and it was but I'll
tell you in a minute and then she got me
hydrate as well so I love those too so I
thought in the UK you could only get the
orange blue blue purple and the two pink
baby lip electrodes but turns out when I
went to Milton Keynes they had the green
and yellow ones and have an open these
yet so I don't know what they smell like
or anything but this one is in fierce
and tangy and this one is in mint and
Cher and I thought you could only get
these abroad so I was so happy when I
saw these in Superdrug for the usual
price of $2.99 so I picked those up
another thing I recently picked up is
this and I got this off featurepoints
gift card and it is a sleek blush by
three palette and in this is in like
pink lemonade and I've heard a lot about
the sleek blush palette but for ten
pounds I was like oh I don't know but
the packaging is stunning and then we
just open it out if it wants to open and
the colors are just stunning
these two are powders and this one is
cream and I just love this palette so so
much I honestly didn't think it was
going to be that amazing but when I
opened it oh wow it's just amazing then
he also picked me up a nail varnish and
a couple of pocket backs so she got me a
se mail polish in Fiji which is one of
the colors I've always wanted to try it
I've never had an Essie nail polisher
before and I'm so excited to try it it's
just a gorgeous pastel pink and I love
it so much
these are quite expensive for nail
polishes but I'm very excited to try
that and she also picked me up three
pocket backs she
me pink chiffon sweet pea and cotton
candy bliss and these are three I've
wanted to try because I've always want
to try the pink one so I love those
thank you now I'm going to redo all the
drugstore pieces I bought myself
recently so the first two are like
concealer and foundation so this is the
l'oreal true match foundation and i've
heard so many good things about this and
i was bit iffy about buying it cuz it's
12 pounds but i was like i'll just go
for it cuz i literally have one
foundation obviously before lily brought
me the stuff but i only had one and oh
my gosh this is the best foundation it
is the perfect color match for me it's
the lightest one I think Rose ivory and
I can't get over like it's the perfect
color match it's just amazing the best
coverage ever it's so smooth it lasts
all day and I love that and to go with
that I decided to get myself and you
concealer so I've got the match
perfection by Rimmel and this is a
highlighter as well and I love this
because it's like you put it under your
eyes and you squeeze it out when it
comes out on the brush so it's really
really handy to just chuck in your bag
and this is amazing and I got this for
three pounds on off then also decided to
try it a couple of blushes and primers
from the drugstore so I'll show you the
blushes first and the first one is this
Revlon baby stick so this was only 2
pounds in the sale and almost like
always worth trying but I don't like it
it's like I don't even know nothing
comes out when I swatch it no idea what
it's meant to be if you know what it's
meant to be just let me know but at the
moment I'm not liking that the other
blush I picked up with her Maybelline
and this is a dream touch blush in
apricot I haven't seen this one on store
because I got it from Amazon but it's
just a cream blush and the only thing I
was really disappointed about this was
it has a crack in the middle and it
shows through ones like the top as well
which is slightly annoying but I paid 6
pound 50 for this which isn't too bad
and I actually really liked it other
than the crack I've also been trying
quite a few primers recently so the
first one is the Maybelline
instance anti-age the smoother so I
didn't get this because I need aging
snow anti-aging or because my skin is
not fresh anymore like really young I
just wanted to try it purely for the
fact I wanted to try on your primer not
any reason because it's like meant to
help you look younger I don't care about
that I just wanted it to try the primer
and it's like a jelly consistency it is
amazing even though it is anti age still
one of the best primers ever and this is
three-pound 85 Hamilton how many were
seeing this in the shots yeah and I also
got to finally all of the baby skin so I
think I've shown these two in a video
before and this is just a normal one and
the cool rose one but they're nearly
picked me up the wall maker got one in
her town because I couldn't find it
anywhere but all three of the baby skins
is now complete finally I have also got
some lip products from the drugstore so
first of all I've got two things from
Revlon I've got a Revlon just bitten
kissable balm stain in 0:15 cherish and
it's just a mild purple color
I'm just watching for you there and yeah
it's a really pretty purple pink color
and I really like this it's one of the
old style packaging but still really
like it and I then got a Revlon lip
butter in 0 to 5 peach parfait
so Lily picked this up for me as well
and because she got a 3 pack and she had
this one already and I didn't so I
really liked it and it goes like gold
undertones it's stunning and really like
that and finally for the end of this
hall I picked up two Kate Moss lipsticks
so I got Kate Moss in number 30 and 107
so 107 is just a gorgeous red and number
30 is a plummy color they both look
really similar but they're not in person
they both look amazing and I literally
cannot wait to wear these all the way
through alter but that is the end of my
huge Beauty haul I'm so grateful for
everything I absolutely know everything
I've got and I've been collecting this
over the past 3 to 4 months I've had
quite a bit of it for a while just never
showed it and you know I'm so grateful
for everything so I hope you have
enjoyed this video
big thumbs up if you did and I'll see
you my next video
