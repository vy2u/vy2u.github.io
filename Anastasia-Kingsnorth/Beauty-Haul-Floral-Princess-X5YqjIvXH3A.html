doing a beauty collective haul whose are
one of my most popular videos on my
channel and I just love throwing them I
get so much enjoyment out of showing you
guys what I got because I love to give
you guys some recommendations and to
show you different things that I've been
picking up over the past few weeks so
I'm not trying to brag about in any way
shape or form and yeah let's get into
the video so I recently went onto Amazon
and I just ordered a few little bits
what I kind of wanted to try and just
try so many things out so I'm just gonna
show you what I got from there first so
the first thing I got was this John
Frieda for the blonde bombshell gift set
so this is a hair gift so obviously
because John Frieda is like blonde hair
and brunette hair stuff I just come to
four different things inside so the
first thing that comes with is the John
Frieda sheer blonde conditioning
treatment and I've had this before it's
really really good right absolutely love
it and then it comes with the so called
car call the name of it hairspray come
to the hairspray and this just makes
your hair a little bit more blonder and
then it also comes with the miniature
versions of the shampoo and the
conditioner this is a champion that's
the conditioner it's highlight
activating so hopefully it will bring
out some more blondness in my hair
because my hair is going really brown
it's got very dark and I kind of wanted
more blonder so instead of dying yet I
thought I would try these the other
thing I picked up from Amazon was also
hair related and it was a new tangle
teezer so I've needed a new tangle
teezer for a while now because I ordered
a purple and pink one but it was meant
to be like purple and again they sent me
dark purple which was the one I already
had so when I'd like got my use out of
that one I decided to pick up this one
and while I figure out open there we go
this box oh wow it hasn't this amazing
pattern around it so it's just black
like this and it just looks like that
and then around here it has this kind of
chiffon a triangle pattern this is
really cool and just look at this it
says tangle teezer just here and all the
bristles are just so nice like Oh
definitely tell when you have a new
tangle teezer and they think this was
only eight pounds so amazing now moving
on to lush I just have a few bits show
you from here so the first thing I
picked up was from the Valentine's Day
range and it was the floating flower
bath ballistic so I really wanted to try
this for a while ever since I've been
seeing in everybody's videos and it just
looks like this it's just pink with a
yellow flower with a green middle and
this was only 2 pounds 95 so so so cheap
for a big bathroom like this like it's
really really big and I just really like
this so I'm really excited to use this
in my bath later on I then it's up the
rose bubble but that will leave as fell
off so I'm just back in and it just
looks like this I'm not sure this is the
Valentine's Day connection or not I
believe I've seen it in stores before
but I just can't really remember and
then they've just fell off again oh and
this is just a bubble bar and I think
it's going to turn it like pink and
glittery so I'm really excited to use
this week I smells like roses and I love
it have recently been into super drug
and just picked up a few little bits
that I really wanted to try so the first
thing is this just say yes
Zoey makeup bag so I've had this for a
while now but it hasn't shown it in a
whole yet so inside it just looks like
this and I've got this for 7 pounds I'm
really really happy with this I use this
bag in my drugstore makeup starter kit
video and I don't know I just love it I
think it's the best makeup bag that she
has bought out so far I also picked up
the Barry M Jenny high shine nail paint
in sugar apple because I picked up
rosehip and the other blue one and
honestly I've always wanted to pick this
one up but I just never do it and I
don't know why I just decided to finally
pick it up and this is only 399 and I'm
actually gonna paint my now to this
after because I love having like pasta
new nail colors on and I really really
like this it was only four pounds so
really good price and yeah I absolutely
love it I also picked up a new face wash
so I've showed this in an Instagram
picture about a week ago and I got this
from superdrug and it's the guy asking
about your soft essentials comforting
Korean wash so as you know by my
skincare routine I use the complete
Garnier range it wasn't sponsored I
genuinely do love all of their products
and I bought them all and I found this
because I really wanted to face wash to
match instead of using that the
Clearasil won because I don't like
mixing my brands because I have quite
bad skin anyway I don't know why because
I'm only 14 but yes so I got this one
and it's like a cream wash you just pump
it out and it comes out all phony
oh it's so nice it has just like roses
just like the micellar cleansing water
and this was only 2 pounds 66 not down
from about 4 pounds so honestly I've
used this twice now and it's first
specializing in dry skin so this is just
perfect for me and I would definitely
recommend it I then took I wonder over
to the sleep counter and I picked up
something for me at amber I got under
the exact same as me so I got the sleek
face contour kit because I have habit on
this for so long and I don't know why I
didn't get it earlier because honestly I
wanted it for ages and it's just a
highlighter and a bronzer so it comes
with this little leaflet inside it's
really nice and just comes with like
loads of different recommendations and
then here is the packaging it's very
sleek see my like little use of words
there hasn't mirror might want to cover
that up so they get blinded and then it
just has this gorgeous highlighter and
this stunning bronzer this is only 650
and this is in the light one because I
have a very very fair skin so I just got
that and honestly I I love it for 650
I've only used it once but I have with a
highlighter on today and it's just so
pretty and I just loved it so much I'm
really glad I finally picked this up if
I mentioned a couple of videos ago shot
mister sent me some elf bits so again
I'm just going to show you another
couple of bits that she sent me
and this haul so I know a lot of you
were commenting that the shipping is
around 19 to 20 pounds and obviously
that is very expensive for shipping but
when I added up like the output so I'm
getting four 60p each if I went on to
the elf website I'm actually getting it
quite a few pounds cheaper so everyone
it does work out well if you do have
about 30 or 40 pounds to spend because
honestly that is worth it for health for
me because we can't get it so in this
haul I'm going to show you the luscious
that liquid
six that they got me so the first one I
don't actually know the names of these
because oh yeah edit is on the site
this one is Ruby slipper this one is
nude pink then we have pink lemonade
brownie points and cherry tart so these
are liquid lipsticks and they just come
out this little applicator at the end
here and I really really like these they
just come in all these different colors
here and I've only used at brownie
points at the moment
I actually have the gloss on top of a
madam glam lip gloss at the moment that
will be showed in a future haul and
these are 60 pH but I think I sent them
to free feel free to review a few guys
but honestly I genuinely love these I
actually happen already so yeah I these
are amazing definitely pick these up
links will be down below so as a lot of
you may already know you may have
actually probably got it was so so
popular benefit port out a brand new
mascara called roller lash and you could
get it free exclusively with Elle
magazine a couple of weeks before it
came out so I don't think it's still out
a lot of people got sent it for free but
I don't think it's out yet so this is
what the mini one looks like it's just
black with a rose gold pink lid and this
is the best mascara I've ever tried I
use this every single day for school it
lasts all day doesn't clump I'm just
gonna like put a bit more on because I
just love it and the wand oh wow I'm
gonna put a close-up it's just perfect
and it came free with Elle's 4 pound
magazine and it just comes in the box as
well and you've got like a selfie thing
to take a picture with it but honestly
this is amazing so if you don't already
have it definitely go and pick it up
from Elle magazine the final thing I
have in this haul is something I'm
really excited about because it's
actually one of my giveaway prizes so
this one is mine but you're Woma trying
to be giving away is in my drawer so if
you haven't enter my giveaway make sure
to go and check my latest video out I'm
gonna be proofing a proof picture on my
Instagram at later today or so later
Saturday so this is the Baby Lips in pop
of pink so I haven't actually opened
this yet because it's limited edition
and I'm really really scared too but
it's just it's like an American it was
their limited
range that they came out with and it's
called pop of pink and with sheer butter
and vitamin e so I'm very very excited
to try this and probably won't be take
it out the packaging anytime soon so I
hope you guys have enjoyed today's haul
I'm sorry it wasn't as long as my usual
hauls or didn't include as much stuff as
my usual hauls but I haven't really been
picking up a lot recently as I've been
kind of more buying for people for
Valentine's Day and everything so yeah I
hope you have enjoyed this thumbs it up
