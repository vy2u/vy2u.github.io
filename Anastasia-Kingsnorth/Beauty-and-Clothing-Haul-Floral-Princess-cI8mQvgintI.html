have a big makeup and clothing haul for
you I only so excited to film this video
because I have some things that I am
absolutely fell in love with in front of
people right now and I cannot wait to
share them with you so I'm these in this
video I've had my arm for a while and I
can't if I finally have them so yeah I
can't want to get into the hall I'm
gonna do all of my beauty and makeup
items first I just got them on like a
tray in front of me I'm gonna do the
only skincare thing I have first and
this is the Garnier micellar cleansing
water I actually found it in a mini size
and I'm literally in love with this it's
like the same size as the Garnier 2 in 1
I remove it alter thing and it is so
cute because I only have about a quarter
of a bottle left of my bigger version so
I thought I'd get the smaller version
because I will be traveling a lot in the
next few months and I thought this would
be perfect and this was only 1 pound 99
from Tesco as well so that was really
affordable the next things that I got
are from the body shop and these two
things I've wanted to try for ages after
hearing velvet goes rave on about them
for absolute years and thousand is a
body shot all-in-one BB cream this BB
cream is meant to be amazing it's color
adapted color adapting rather and I
think it's more of a tinted moisturizer
than a full-on BB cream because it
doesn't give me as much coverage as I
would have hoped but it is very good
it's a clay like a white consistency you
are pretty shocked about where I opened
the bottle I was expecting it to be like
proper tinted but it wasn't by also got
the body shop insular which is amazing
this product is just phenomenal it keeps
your makeup on all day and I will never
fault this and I'll literally rebuy it
over and over again my next lot of
things are all from Amazon because I
kind of had the 50 or 60 pounds left on
my gift card and I just decided to
splurge and spend it all on makeup that
I wanted to try for a really long time
so the first thing that I got was from
Rimmel and if the Rimmel lasting finish
a thousand kisses stay on lip contouring
pencil and this is in the
zero-one-one spice my mum was telling me
that this was a really popular shade
when she was younger and it looks really
kind of gent Cuyler Jenny what Kylie
Jenner asked and I really really liked
it it was I think it was it actually
come in a pack of three but I gave the
other two away it was like three four to
nine tonight which is incredible because
I wore this last night and the
pigmentation is amazing the next three
things that I got off from Milani now on
the American Amazon Milani is actually
more expensive than it is on the English
Amazon which I was very shocked about
because apparently in America Milani is
not the cheapest brand but I couldn't
get over the amazing prices so I first
of all got a lipstick and the packaging
looks like this it's just a Goldy color
and mine is in $27.00 shade caramel oak
I think that's how you say it anyway and
it's kind of a gorgeous it's definitely
not mad it's like glittery and shiny and
it's kind of a tinted red but then it
has like hints of pink and brown in it
and I can definitely see why they called
into Galecki caramely color because
that's definitely what it is and this
was exactly three pounds sixty three
which is amazing for a lipstick that
looks like this and to be honest I was
completely sold by the packaging so I'm
probably gonna end up buying loads of
these the next my only thing I've got I
haven't actually had a chance to try but
it's the Milani brow and I highlighted
pencils as you can see I still like this
in the packet but it looks amazing
so it's a two-in-one maps an eye
highlighter so it can shape and
highlight the brow but it also can
highlight your inner corner which I
really like and this looks stunning as
well like the map
well the matte shame that's really nice
but I really like the shimmery champagne
e-type card color I think that really
like look nice under here and in the
corner and this was only 399 so freely
amazing final thing I got from Milani
it's probably my favorite thing because
it's just so stunning I'm totally gonna
get out the package for it to show you
it is the Milani illuminating face
powder this is a gorgeous gorgeous
illuminating little palette type thing
and when you open it it just has all
these little roses inside there's some
brown one pink red and white because it
says you can use this for contour
highlighting and blushing blushing some
make sense no blusher I get so confused
two different words yeah I think I'm
like have a problem with that but this
is 0-3 beauty's touch and it just shows
you on the back as well where you can
use it and this is only six pounds and
it's just all gold and a packaging it's
stunning and it's a really deep pan as
well so I'm so excited to try that the
next thing I got was one benefit and it
was the mini benefit they're real
mascara I've heard from several
different people that the miniature is a
lot better than the big because my
full-sized version is literally dried
out now like what I do it all I put on
my eyelashes it which is completely
clump up because it's dried out so much
and nothing will barely come out so I've
got the mini and the mini is such an
adorable size it just looks so so cute
and the brush on it looks incredible
like oh my god that brush looks amazing
and this was 995 so obviously half the
price as the full size but I really like
the bottle of it and it seems to have a
lot in and then it comes in a cute
little box as well so that was sold to
me as soon as I saw it the next thing I
got was from makeup revolution and this
was the beyond flawless ultra eye shadow
palette so this has 32 ultra
professional eyeshadows in and that
really intrigued me because I really
wanted a pallet wood looked well they
look very professional but it also had
some really nice shadows in so it looks
like this and it's just all black and it
says revolution in rose gold writing and
obviously that packaging is amazing and
then when you open it it has a big big
mirror here but then it also has 32
different eyeshadow colors it also come
to the little thing what essential the
names but I'm just trying to find the
best way to show you this is that
blinding you probably like that and it
just has a ton of different colors on
Pink's blues Browns nudes it's such a
gorgeous palette and this was only 11
pound but it does retail you could look
for 8 pounds so for that many other
shadows it's amazing
the last two makeup items I got from
Amazon were two things from L'Oreal and
these were two things I've actually
wanted to try for a while so my favorite
foundation is the L'Oreal True Match and
because they had no collection
concealers on there I thought I would
try the L'Oreal True Match concealer I
haven't actually had the chance to
properly try this year I've only swatch
it on the back of my
and but on the back of my hand it
blended really easy it looks a perfect
color tone match for me because I kind
of like to go a little bit lighter so
then when I bronze highlight and put my
blusher on it kind of stands out more
because I like to put quite a bit of
blush on because I put powder again over
and then it will fade out that's kind of
how I do it
so I thought this concealer would look
really nice and it would definitely
highlight my under eyes and my bridge of
my nose the Cupid's bow and then on my
chin so this is only about six pounds
and it's really good the next thing I
got was the lawyer Paris lumi magique
pure light primer so I'm not gonna lie
the rose gold lid completely sold me as
soon as I saw it but I've actually
wanted to try this for ages there's
actually a really funny story I was in
Boots one time and I wanted to try it
but I didn't know how to open it and I
accidentally pulled off the whole thing
I know you're thinking how didn't know
how to open it it has a pump but I
pulled it open and it went all over my
trousers and it was so embarrassing so
this time I'm going to be very careful
to use the pump like a normal person and
yeah I love this and it was that ten
pound I've used it twice and it's kind
of make upon a lot longer than the
benefit Porefessional now that is all of
my beauty items that I've been moving on
to clothing I first of all have boo hoo
and boo hoo sent me a few things to try
but I got to choose so I obviously love
all the things that I chose so the first
thing is this what I'm actually wearing
and it's a white boyfriend blazer I will
try and overlay clip but I'm not sure if
it'll work but it basically has two side
pockets and it's like a blazer but bit
longer like a boyfriend coat it's just
like a sheer material and I love this
and the main reason I got it was for
beautycon the next thing I got again was
for beautycon and it is this kind of
peachy toned shirt so it just has these
scalloped sleeves and then it also has
the scalloped edging and it is so so
pretty it looks really nice on and it is
the perfect size to me and the perfect
material as well and this retails at ten
pounds then have a couple of things to
show you from new look so the first
thing I got I think it's kind of a
love/hate situation I don't know whether
you like them or don't
meet them but I personally love them and
they are these shoes they look like this
and they're pastel pink on top and
they're like white at the bottom and
they're kind of like the wedges I guess
and I got these again for beauty
Congress I finally organized my outfit
and I think they are so nice they were
22 99 which obviously isn't the cheapest
for shoes but I'll get so much wear out
of these in the summer time because
they're cut they're not like a dark
color or anything so I can wear them
loads and I love these so much and then
got a pair of blue kind of patterned
trousers and this is what I'm going to
wait for you to come with my top and
these shoes so they look like this and
they've got a kind of this florally
tribally print going on and they just
got a button up here and then they go
all the way down and then the ends just
like this and I suppose you could cuff
them but I kind of like how they are now
and these were 15 pounds but I actually
went to new look today and they were not
down to seven so that was great for me
because that always happens the final
thing I got from new look is a purse and
I are in love with it so it looks like
this and it's a kind of a lile icky pink
color with rose gold undertones on it
and it has little hexagons or the
hexagons yeah with like little lines and
dots on and then you open it out and it
has so many compartments I literally
haven't even put anything in this yet
it's still got the foam bits in because
I only just got home about half an hour
ago and I really wanted to film this
haul so I absolutely love this and it's
just five pound in sale now we are onto
my favorite thing in this whole oh my
god I don't even get me started and it
is from Topshop
and I've wanted this for so long I saw
it in talked to about a month ago and
then I saw Beauty crush had it in her
video in an outfit video and I was like
okay I need that and it's a handbag and
it looks like this so it's a little
black tote bag and it's so pretty so it
has two zips here and a front pocket
then inside it has a big main pocket and
two little pockets but this one comes
out and then it just has a long strap
two handles here and it says Topshop and
then the side kind of has this gorgeous
little square out cut pattern and
this was the most expensive thing I've
ever bought isn't a bag wise because it
was 36 pounds
but I really wanted to pop a bag it's
really good leather its proper nether
and I thought these are very cute
together so I know it's quite a bit of
money but I asked Seaton of them this is
the end of my call today I really hope
you enjoyed the video thumbs it up if
you did and let me know if you want me
to do a lot more halls because hallways
are one of my favorite videos to film I
love you or not
thumbs up the video if you enjoyed and I
will see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
