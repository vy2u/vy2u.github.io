pre-event star pool party tonight with
some Rocha and Lily and then I'm gonna
meet some of the youtubers there and I'm
really really excited and yeah and then
beautycon tomorrow so I'm pretty excited
so we just got to our hotel room it took
a long time to get here because we
realize you have to put the key in the
left but then we just got here no in the
bathroom because I think the bathroom
has got really good lighting so I've got
the style whole party to go to in about
half an hour but only sriracha is here
at the moment so still waiting for Lily
and the 11 other youtubers that are
staying here
so I've just been you should get ready

the day when I'm there but I straighten
my hair I've got my makeup done and now
I'm just going to pack away all of the
makeup and go eat so eternity for

are leaving to become our just in the
car and ladies mum is in the front
I've never
yeah
religion say
it was quite wet yeah so it is currently
Sunday now it's the day after beautycon
and I got home really late last night I
didn't want to film that bit then but I
decided to add on to the end of the vlog
a bit of a haul and basically explaining
my experience at beautycon London so for
me beautycon was absolutely incredible I
would definitely go back every single
get if I had it at London because
honestly I enjoyed it so much I met so
many amazing youtubers as you would have
seen in the vlogs and the pictures what
I just put before this part of the video
and I met so many of you guys I had an
amazing meet up at the news L stand
behind I can little bow and we all stood
in the boat took some pictures and it
was really incredible
all the people were so lovely there and
the environment was so happy but I would
definitely recommend that you buy a
ticket wherever you are and definitely
go to the next one so I also thought I
would do a little bit of a haul as I did
get quite a few like free things as you
were going around there and I just
wanted to show you a few of them but we
also did get like quite a few pictures
taken so we got some well me and social
festival went into the style or photo
booth at the style or pre event party on
Friday and we got some taken and then
when Lily arrived we did another lot and
these pictures are so nice I love them I
always wanted to get some pictures like
this we then also went to the Capital FM
stand thing and this was me sorry no me
Lily
alia and Lewis and we also got some more
pictures done and I love these we really
funny in them we just posed and yeah I
really like me I then got this little
card thing with banner roses pictures on
when I went to meet her at the tarts
down so I didn't actually know the tart
would giving away a free gift bag for
the creators but first of all before I
knew that I actually bought a blush and
I bought a blush book and I can't find
her anywhere so I just bought the tart
cream blood actually this is a cream
blush I think it's a normal brush and
it's in the shade flash and that rhymes
and it's just this gorgeous kind of
purply toned blush I really really liked
this I've always wanted to try it out
blush and for 10 pounds I just had to
buy that as I said I then found out that
we got a free goodie bag so
it come in this little purple bag here
and we've got some really nice things in
it so it also did actually get a beauty
Compaq I'm not going to show you that
because I kind of will pack that away
but it came in like some nails some
benefit minis some eyelashes some hair
bit but it also came with two tarps
Cara's at the same mascara so I'll
probably just give one away to one of my
friends or something but it's the Tarte
gifted Amazonian clay smart mascara and
it just looks like this and it's in like
a wooden packaging which is really cool
and then the brushes like that and I
love this then got the Tarte Amazonian
clay pot Amazonian clay clay pot and
this is a waterproof eyeliner and mine
is in like a brownie shade we then got
the Tarte marriage you marry Pooja
I think I'm saying that right I'm not
too sure but I'm not really sure what
this is oh you put it on a face and neck
but I've heard quite a bit about this so
I'm excited to try that we then got the
Tarte the sculptor contouring face stick
also got the Tarte
edge sketch double ended bamboo eyeliner
brush we've also got the Tarte energy
lip surgence lip gloss and this is so
pretty if I could play a glass to put
over anything what you want to make a
bit more glossy and then my favorite
thing in the little bag was the Tarte
showstopper clay palette I was so
shocked when I saw this I was so so
happy because I don't learn anything
from tar and now I own quite a bit from
Tarte so it just looks like this
and then it's like rosy gold and you
just open it and it has a giant mirror
and then cover the mirror I'll show you
it just comes with all of these
different eyeshadows and blushes and
it's so gorgeous
so the best I could you bag I got there
was definitely from NYX and all the
people in the VIP lounge got one of
these and it just looks like this it is
so big and I'm so hard to show you all
of this stuff because it's probably
about 30 things in here if I go through
it all like in detail it's gonna take me
way too long so I'm just gonna briefly
say what I got first thing I got was
Enix the curved felt tip eyeliner I got
two bronzers one in general one light
and one in 0 3 medium I got two powder
blushes one in peach and one in
bittersweet I got the NYX Hey
studio photogenic finishing powder then
got to eyes shadow pencils like jumbo
eyeshadow pencils one in milk and one
soft fuchsia I got the NYX matte finish
long-lasting spray which was amazing and
got the NYX adorable packer then got the
NYX HD primer base the NYX pore filler
and the NYX shine killer got the NYX on
to glow liquid illuminator and then
another spray the double-ended wonder
stick which is our highlighting that and
contour stick and then I got the NYX a
push-up bra for your eyeshadow pencil it
eyebrow cake powder and the NYX wallop
to us lush lashes mascara I then got a
bunch of lipsticks and some of these are
the butter lipsticks and some of these
