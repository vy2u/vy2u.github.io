going to be doing a what I got for my
birthday haul 2015 so on Tuesday the
13th of October it was my 15th birthday
and I should be honest with you I'm
gonna go pretty honest I wasn't even
gonna do this video because I don't know
I felt like there's only posting a few
Instagram pictures of my presents this
year but on every single social media
platform my own
it was weird about they all pleased your
birthday who watched you get for your
birthday so like you know what I'm just
gonna do a birthday haul because I
actually already had a different video
plan for this weekend but I'm just gonna
do that next weekend because you guys
wanted this video and I want to do what
you want as well
whatsoever so I have such a bad cold
right now and it is really ready and
wean me and yeah just gonna get that out
there but yes so just a quick disclaimer
I'm not trying to brag or boast in any
way shape or form you know that I'm not
doing that I know that I've got a lot
for my birthday and I know that I'm so
grateful for all of that I know that
some people don't even get anything for
their birthday which is why I am so
grateful to be able to have got all of
this and I really want you guys to know
that because I'm only doing this because
you wanted to see what I got but anyway
I'm gonna start with this really
long-winded intro and get into it
because let's be honest I think that's
what you care about so yeah let's get
started so for my main pressing off of
my mom she actually got me kind of two
things one of which I only knew about so
I was so shocked when I open the other
one so the first one I knew about I'm
wearing now I can't actually show you
but I'm pretty sure you're not gonna
like they are the black super skinny
high-waisted Topshop journey jeans I
want to join you jeans for so long but
this is gonna sound so stupid but when I
see 36 pounds on a pair of jeans I just
can't it oh that's so much money on pair
of jeans so those are okay I last one
with my birthday so I got least my
birthday because all of my jeans never
fit properly they're always either baggy
at like the bottom or they're just a bit
loose around the waist but Topshop have
the perfect fitting jeans and I cannot
stress enough just goes Topshop because
they're jeans are incredible so I
absolutely love these jeans so she got
me these and you know they're just
completely black and then for my
surprise which was
thing I was most shocked about oh my god
I still can't believe it she got me a
Polaroid Instax Mini 8 so I'm not gonna
show it fully in the shop because my
lighting goes horrible but miss pot
burns out there we go I've got the in
Saxony 8 and I love it so much it's the
white wine I'm pretty sure it's the
latest one I've actually took a few
shots already because I absolutely love
taking photos on this thing I'm going to
be taking kind of artistic he shots more
than memory shots I guess because I feel
like I want to make them really artistic
so took one of my room and I took one of
me holding my phone away the hotline
bling screenshot which the motor sent me
yeah probably won't understand what I
meant by that but yeah so I just took
some of those photos and I absolutely
love my polaroid I'm so grateful to have
got that for my birthday because I know
that some people wouldn't even get half
of that so honestly thank you so much
mom it means lows to me my mum also got
me a few little like chocolatey bit she
got me to brain liquors which I
absolutely loved and I had it before I
went to school and I got to school well
into the bathroom amber and I was like
oh my god my tongue is blue and I had a
blue tone so I had to sit there in the
morning a drop and eat a wrap to get rid
of my blue tongue story of my life done
but yeah she's got me some chocolate and
everything and it was so so nice so
thank you so much mom for all of that I
absolutely love it and I'm so grateful
so I'm now gonna move on to my dad so my
dad actually got with something that is
in the background of this video so it is
basically this copper lamp just here or
you can see is that the little stem of
it stem you know what I mean but that's
what you can see so I will over there
clip of that but it's from home base and
because so I've got so many clients
