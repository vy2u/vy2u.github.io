back and I am super excited because I am
working with Beauty bait to bring you my
Black Friday wishlist so everything that
I'm showing you guys today is up to 30%
off in the Black Friday weekend sales on
beautybay and I couldn't be more excited
because I am such a lover of beauty BAE
and all of the Browns they stock on
there and up to 70 brands are having a
huge sale on all makeup items so I am
super super excited because I have a
bunch that I'm going to show you here
today and literally I could not be more
in love with them also I'm so excited to
show you them as I said I was lucky
enough to pick some bits to show you so
that is exactly what I'm gonna do today
I really really hope you enjoy the video
and let's get started so the first thing
I have is from one of my favorite brands
at the moment and it's called Gerard
cosmetics
I have their lip cone on today but I'm
going to be talking about the slay all
day setting spray so in the back for any
sales at Jericho's metics they're having
up to 30% off but this is absolutely
gorgeous I'm in love with this as I said
I'm a big big lover of Gerard cosmetics
and I've heard a lot about this setting
spray so I decided to get it it comes in
this gorgeous slim matte bottle and it
just says slay all day setting spray and
I got mine in the scent of jasmine and
it smells so good it's kind of like
Rosie I guess that's how I would
describe it but I love this I've used it
twice now just to give you guys a little
texture so I could tell you my true
opinion on it and it's really good I
have really oily skin as you guys know
if you don't watch my videos for a long
time this sets a makeup all day and what
I mean all day I literally mean all day
I definitely recommend you pick this up
whilst it's on sale for the Black Friday
weekend because it is so good and so
worth the money the next thing I have is
from a brand called la splash now I'm
super excited about this as well because
when I was in Paris
my friend Lewis had one of these and I
literally wore it every day I'm pretty
sure you guys probably would have seen
it in Western app chats and my
instagrams but literally I absolutely
adored it so what I found out that it
was on sale for the Black Friday weekend
I know I had to get one again any flash
are having up to 30% off and I am so
excited about this this is the LA slash
crystallized glitter so it comes in this
gorgeous little ball and it has like a
coppery Goldy lid and mine is in the
shade angels tip and it's this gorgeous
Goldy color but it has kind of like
yellowy green undertones this looks
stunning and I mean stunning with
burgundy eyeshadow and I literally just
love this you just open it up like this
and there's a glitter it's just all out
like this and it's so beautiful this is
one of my favorite things I have from
this haul I definitely recommend you
pick these up I'm gonna definitely be
getting more because I love these so
much I don't know about you but I find
it really hard to find lose glitters
that are actually really good and when I
look at like those Instagram Gold's
photos I'm pretty sure these are the
ones they use the literally these are
amazing and definitely recommend you
pick these up and then I also got
another loose glitter from a brand
called lipped cosmetics and again I
heard of these through social media and
I really really wanted to try one of
them I'm pretty sure you would have seen
them but they basically look like this
and they're these stackable glitters so
in the it cosmetics are having 30% off
as well and I literally love these so as
I said the aim of them is you get loads
and then you stack them up so you have
like stackable glitters but this isn't
literally gorgeous you again you just
open it up like this
and there it is just on top mine is this
gorgeous bronze shade I literally love
it so much
it's called Oprah and I love the
packaging it's very sleek it's very nice
and the quality of the product is really
really good as well again I've really
been getting into our channel recently
so I just tend to put the pictures all
over my lid and then a really dark sharp
shade along the crease just so it looks
a pop a bit more but this with eyelashes
looks phenomenal and seriously you need
to pick this up whilst it's on sale
because it's amazing now the two things
that I picked up are some really
exciting things because I've never had
these before oh how about one of them
but I wouldn't really count it as one
because it's really small so they're
from a disease palette deep hello again
having 30 percent off at beauty very
calm and I'm fully in love with it and
it's just the large palette if you don't
know what Z pallets out there basically
empty palette where you get these little
magnets and you can stick loose I chose
on them so like loads of different
rounds do loose eyeshadows but they're
just in the panned in my drawer so this
is a perfect way that you can store your
eyeshadows
these are having 30% off in a sale which
means if that's quite a saving and I
literally love
they come with magnets as well but I
also got another stair pack of them
because I do have a lot of our shadows
to store by literary love is literally
just an empty pallet like this it's so
sleek a really easy way to store your
things and I would definitely recommend
you pick these up they're really common
and a lot of UT youtubers have them and
they're just realized because you can
make up your own palettes if you want to
make up kind of pinky Burgundy palette
you can do that if you want to make up a
nude palette you can do that it's so
creative and such an easy way to steal
our shadows so I would definitely
definitely recommend you pick these up
from blue to be calm in the sale the
next things I got I also super excited
about because I've recently been getting
into wearing eyelashes and if you're
going to fly snapchat Instagram or
Twitter which are all linked down below
you will see that I've been posting
quite a few pictures where I've done my
makeup a bit more adventurous I guess
you could today so I have two sets of
lashes from the lower lashes who are
having 20% off in the Black Friday sales
and I am in love with these so I have
two pair got from Mama which a look like
this you can't really see them so I'll
get them out and I have this pair fluff
and thick and it's so gorgeous I've all
these ones already I wore them to a
party on Saturday and they are so
beautiful they're like this they're very
thick and fluttery which I really like
because I have fairly big eyes so I like
to have big voluminous eyelashes I
haven't wore these on jet but I love
them so much they're a lot more natural
a normal fluttery and I thought these
would be perfect for everyday wear and
then these other ones are perfect for
night where as I said I've been really
getting into and eyelashes recently and
the packaging of these and just
everything about them is so beautiful
you really get what you pay for with
these eyelashes and I would definitely
recommend you pick some up whilst they
in the Black Friday sales and the final
product I picked up I'm super excited
about though because I've only recently
got a few of these so size pick up
another one and it's one of the Lime
Crime Velveteen these are floating
around YouTube but absolute ever and I
just didn't know where I could get them
from and then I found them on PU tv.com
and I'm so excited about them so mine is
in the shade
cashmere and it just looks like this
it's a very nude toned Brown it's very
neutral which i think is perfect for
school and it just has this gorgeous red
and pink rose lid which I love the
quality of the packaging and amazing and
lying primer having again sir
sent off in the Black Friday we can say
also such a saving I have three of these
now and I have to say I love the quality
of these lipsticks they are really long
lasting and they're really pigmented as
well especially the darker shades that
they are super pigmented so yeah if you
haven't tried on creme before Black
Friday weekend you definitely your
chance to because I love these so that
