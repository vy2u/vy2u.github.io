joined here with my best friend amber
hello and we are going to be doing a
British people tries American candy
video
who else what it's called probably won't
call in that but that's what we're doing
so long story short I'm just gonna tell
you this now I ordered some american
tweets and they didn't come they're
meant to come today and I was gonna wait
until they were here but we're going to
the cinema tonight I'm you can't wait
any longer so I'm really no except a
like 10 pounds for them so I'm probably
gonna end up in a part two in a few
weeks so you want to see that just let
me know the comments or Justin eat them
anyway but yeah so we're just gonna get
started because I still do have some
here just not as many as I would have
hoped so hope you don't think a lot
there's like zero to taste and there are
no what we just want to say that we
don't want to offend yeah what if we
don't like the candy like I'm sure it's
lovely but if we don't like it we don't
like it and we're gonna be very
different
yeah I was candy in a way to be honest
actually looks very good
oh really sorry so sorry okay so we're
gonna start off with we're gonna start
off with the airheads fruits Oakland you
can get the errors bars but I just got
these because I have them already in
another American so I have tried these
before and I really do actually like
there's Apple blueberry strawberry
orange and lemon I think we don't have
apple maybe I'm gonna try to get a blue
so yeah I mean I'm going after you drink
but I think I'm going to try Apple
because I have an apple we totally won
it smell good okay I don't have to be
quite chick I know that I'm gonna
forward to it okay I really like that
one I really like this white lush
oh my gosh well I don't need them
oh I don't think I don't think I would
like a bob into lemon no I'm gonna try
the green one now so I'm really
intrigued I don't break news channel
turn I love these I love these nothing
they're pretty cheap as well so oh wow
ten out of ten of these we're now going
to do the pretzel M&amp;amp;Ms
so either be interesting they feel
really big I don't actually
oh yeah they're really good I bought
these from BM so I never mind I'm going
to Iraq oh oh
I'll wait in fact on that these are to
whitewash your attic but after that one
they're different to how I expected I
thought that they were acting these
pretzels with Eminem founder all right I
think I give these like a 5 out of 10
I'm so stubborn I'm gonna techno-system
alia they are nice but I'm not gonna go
into M&amp;amp;M so now we're going to try the
Reese's - peanut butter cups I actually
tried Reese's I don't really I have
behind it before but I want to try this
I really have to have these in there
American because they're like classic
alright the ones that are like
and I didn't actually like them but I
feel my otherwise oats are three those
pretzels are four anyway taste in my
mouth
mmm that's all really good taste
those do look good okay oh that's soft I
think there's no we're doing it okay so
no no I guess we've got the cup ones I
like they just Rimmel really good I like
the Reese's Pieces I'm doing those I
don't like I don't really know I like
those ones these are really sickly oh my
god there's a few that I like that they
gentlemen all different colors are you
ready it is so peanut buttery well that
is really nice actually I like it I
couldn't set any too many of them
but it's quite a lot of peanut butter
oh yeah I actually really like that I'll
actually fished after I think a lot of
Americans have peanut butter a lot of
them I normally give that I came up I
couldn't eat too much it's only been a
next we have the classic we have some
Hershey's so I've got these mini bars I
think they were really cute so I'm just
gonna try the Hershey to cookies and
cream to be honest I try a bunch of this
because that actually makes me feel
really sick so like an American chop it
is a lot more filling than where it
chakra yeah it's quite um fill in like
she said I feel like Josiah done this a
nice video didn't he did it oh they
smell really nice actually really milk
I'll make it away
that I like that very milky mmm really
milky it's not too bad I'm gonna eat the
whole bar look good I like this but I
actually prefer the reef this one more I
found that really intriguing these are
actually low we'll come in more common
in England there's our treated are they
do them in different colors that flavors
the normal way is nice as well
okay next up we have flips white fudge
covered pretzels and so I've been every
time you know ripping FaceTime really
clean Papa shiny don't use it they're
really really good so rings much are
these just like I said oh the Hershey's
dream chocolatey take them well too much
chocolate oh my god right so we're gonna
try these these are almost it's know
exactly like a milk like this milk
I'm gonna sleep really already sick of
chocolate by the end of this they look
like this there are you know there are
mommy of like those frogs what where are
they from like the little frogs or like
We Heart It you know they're transparent
the frogs
yeah I really wanted to pray that all
through she oh boy right now we are
gonna try these how do you nervous about
theythey pop it out your air oh I don't
know if that's a good mix the pretzel
taste nice let the comb room out oh my
god what oh my god you jr. was so much
more no no names real man oh my god oh
my gosh you thought I'm gonna be sick
back through the horrible I'm really
sorry for you - I'm annoying because all
I've been thinking about number these
amedy to be honest I've never really
been the practical person so I'll
probably why don't enjoyed the number
that's just some not good mix right now
next we're going in with a Butterfinger
peanut butter cups I thought a lot wow
these are really great I can't wait
named Ricky thing whoa oh thanks strong
but let me just compare this smell
these smell a lot more like peanut
butter but then these smell a lot more
like caramel peanut butter what they
call again they are peanut butter cup
clenchy crunching
that is hot coffee I don't like coffee
oh my god no
0:10 sorry but fingers actually quite
like that um I think I give it like a
three or a four I wouldn't be able to
top this whole thing because I don't
quite think I don't understand is I
don't understand how people can sit
there and have those a lot I just don't
I don't get that okay the final thing we
are going to try is the fudge brownie
cookie dough bites because I'm so
excited about these I love brownies
think about doing a bacon video on
brownies because sometimes I put these
for brownies

thought these were browning's like
actual brownies they are they're just
fine Wow they smell they have to get
quite nice well Bart 10 they're just
coming to meet us in the last night I'm
not sure they aren't ruining us I think
