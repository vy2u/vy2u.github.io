back and I'm here with my mum again and
we're back in the car back by popular
demand Wow
everybody loved my video that I filmed
with my mum so today we'll come back and
we're going to be doing the chicken
nugget challenge which mum doesn't
really want to do but I really want to
do it and I know you guys really want to
see us do it so we're gonna do it we're
also gonna be doing like a little Q&amp;amp;A
whilst we're doing it and we also have
chips because basically so normal
chicken nugget challenges have about
sixty chicken nuggets each but there is
no way on earth that we were going to be
able to do that so we're just going to
say I'll go with ya we're just going to
set a shorter amount of time and eat 20
with chips and a whole drink and we'd
probably sell it for like 6 or 7 minutes
because you don't want to do it's like a
full-on challenge challenge because you
want to answer questions as well I'd
actually have fun doing it mummy what
you drinking can't drink that yet I'm
really hot in here
I need to open a window so I'm going to
set a timer on my phone for I think 7
minutes that we have to eat all these in
my ardent honestly think I'm gonna I
don't I I don't I'll be surprised if I
do it I'd have more chance doing it if I
have the window opened I am so hot we've
got our chicken and is essentially the
chips as well or just it is a separate
people if you do the chips so we've got
all our chicken nuggets here and I've
got my chips here so we need to open our
sausage in get your sausage ready I've
gone for sweet and sour my mom
members gone for barbeque I've never
actually ordered 20 chicken nuggets for
myself before so this is going to be
interesting over any other eight than
with other people know we've shared box
we've shared a box but we've never had a
box each so you ready yeah three two one
go they're really hot as well well
really hot so while we're doing it often
with these Q&amp;amp;A questions but I just
really like my mouth is stuffed
mr. taught me an awful might be able to
talk for the whole video Lam hmm the
only second one already Laurent who sees
a challenge or not yeah but oh what I'm
not eating it for the fun of that I
think you're gonna win I'm struggling l
just ate one oh by the way guys any
convention
I hope Webber is in the back but here's
a sweet so I starting to my perfect
wheel he's starting to wake up your
three ready in the cheeks I'm gonna open
the window a minute the object on my
second one I can't
although I prefer is waking up early no
mesial nuggets Atticus just doing the
challenge I also forgot we have a ton of
chips to eat as well oh not so I'm not
gonna be able to eat the chips as run in
six minutes we've had a minute and a
half of what drove on the eight to four
hundred challenge so while the answer
needs at night while we eat dinner
challenge I wanted to like answer some
questions so what is our favorite memory
together so many my personal favorites
when we're in America and we got lost
our luggage remember remember we went to
America last year and I were making a
joke right I can imagine if our luggage
got lost ten minutes later I like it got
lost
it was so weird my snapchat it was so
funny it was a funny bit of one really
funny
he wasn't funny very action like it
wasn't funny
it was good for me
Atticus do you want a chicken nugget my
thought is going to help me so the next
question is how did I tell you that I
started my period you I was in my
bedroom you and yours with Amber mm-hmm
your and I just heard this like scream
like you would be murdered and yeah just
she scream man Oh mom how obvious
only what was happening but it was
really unexpected because I remember one
had a really bad day anyway and then I
just yeah I didn't really help so that's
what is that but you do that quite often
what you sauce scream out man yeah I so
it's like a world ending like thing
that's happened it's like you just want
to drink or something next question is
what um what was something that we've
done that's really embarrassing oh god
doesn't have anything so embarrassing
come on Tom Oh God so many 42 years
worth tell me many oh my god
count wanna think of one that's suitable
Oh help me out Anna will you say in this
load so you I'll he was on out and so
many Barisan things Oh until whoever
this is Sybil antenna where their
mouthful when I was about let me get the
age right I think I was about 20 I think
and got really drunk one night and on
split up with this boy that I've been
with for a long long time you engaged
and stuff and obviously I still loved
him
so I decided my drunken state of mind to
climb by and climb up his wall to his
house like the DM Spellman yeah
basically almost got to the top fell
flat on my back and broke one of my
disks
in my back I was got on my back in
hospital for a week so there's a lesson
for you
that's no climb up a wall for a man when
you drunk or when you sober wise words
mum no time at all for a man you go way
Nenana don't know there was a little
insight into the time to get into the
what you Kate your words huh God we need
to open a window service Liana a little
bit cuz we're gonna laugh hey guy bit
there I've got about 14 seconds got my
heart I think I might I want to know
actually you've got quite a few quarter
Hey
oh my god well no I love it did happen
thing didn't even see what you're eating
that many Oh
mmm-hmm and the winner is I think it's
kind of stays here had no money of eight
say four thousand one mile it is so bad
three four five six seven eight nine
take you up at nine kind of that nine me
is at all it's a draw was it just
teaches peace on
or somehow no I think that it's kind of
bad because some people can clear forty
in like ten minutes away and we really
live cleared nine I stop bigger stomachs
that are used to eating that amount all
the time surely to fit forty and you
tell me I don't even a barely any of my
chips I'm an ardent that was hard I
don't know how people died but it's
problem what we wanted to talk it's cuz
we be told if there's a hell I if you
come in just here if I get you out your
seat and you come just here you can say
hello to her people do you know it's
just woke up nice to meet you smoke out
and he wants you happy me on his toy
don't but so many people want us to be
in a video but you can't all you can see
is their eyes see just as your eyes free
to see so that is the end of this video
I really hope you enjoyed it if you did
give it a huge thumbs up to Liam thank
you again mum for coming onto my hair we
both drew and I was going to say that
the winner had to buy know the loser had
to buy the other one of that flurry but
we both drew so that's not really going
to happen think to eat more you'd have
to just concentrate on the Nuggets and
not yeah you could ask what I must do
but in the video would be very
entertaining so I wanted to do an to get
yeah yeah I love you all so much and I
will see you next Sunday at 10 a.m. for
a brand new video bye bye
with my past again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
