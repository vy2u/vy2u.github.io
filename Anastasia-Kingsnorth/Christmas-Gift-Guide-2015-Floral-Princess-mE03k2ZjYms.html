going to be doing my 2015 Christmas gift
guide for girls I wanted to do one of
these videos to kind of kick off my
Christmas and videos because you know I
feel like these are really popular
videos to do and I personally will you
do my Christmas shopping and wrapped
everything because I'm crazy like that
but I know this is kind of like prime
time to go out and buy Christmas
presents now so I thought it's a perfect
video to start with so I don't actually
have any of the things with me like
normal gift guys I'm just gonna put a
picture on the screen because I think
it'll be quite expensive for me just to
go and buy the things that I'm going to
show so I'm just going to put a picture
on the screen but everything in this
video is going to be under 20 pounds and
they are all suitable for like friends
best friends mum sisters auntie's
cousins basically any girl that you were
buying for I would be so so happy to
receive any of this for Christmas and
this is why I thought I'll show you this
because it also could help with things
you could put on your Christmas list and
yeah so I hope you're doing a video and
let's get started
so the first lot of things are from soap
&amp;amp; Glory because soap &amp;amp; Glory is my
literal favorite thing at Christmas
especially going on the Boxing Day sales
in Boots and they do everything for half
price so it is amazing but the first set
is the soap &amp;amp; Glory winter wonder hand
set and this is basically it gives that
that includes three of the hand foods a
smoothie style sugar crush and the
original scent this is like I think it's
my actual favorite set from the
Christmas range because I love the
smoothie starsin and when I saw their
done it in a hand food for only 8 pounds
I was just like you know what I really
need that so I've actually put it on my
Christmas list because I love it and
another one is that 8 pound sets is one
with three body creams and it just has
to be if the soap of all your body
creams in in like a smaller travel sized
version and the good thing about this is
so gooey is on three for two so if
you're buying for quite a few friends I
think this is a really good kind of area
to go because they also do five pound
righteous butter pot so you can buy 3
for 10 pounds because it's a four to
offer so it's really affordable for like
if you're going to buy for quite a few
friends and yeah I think that it's the
perfect Christmas present the next
things are lush now I also love lush at
Christmastime lush is just like heaven
on earth like
everybody
/ at Christmastime and there do the most
amazing bath bombs and bubble bars and
everything like that my personal
favorite gift set from lush for
Christmas time anyway is the lush Snow
Fairy gift set because these two
products and my favorite things yeah
they're actually pretty expensive to buy
kind of like separately but for 8 pounds
75 you can get a small version of this
Snow Fairy shower gel and a block of
pink fun now these are only 5 pounds to
buy separately and you'll get in them
for cheaper in a really pretty gift box
so this is the perfect present I thought
this is a really good present as well
for like a sister maybe or like a cousin
because everybody uses lush around
Christmas time I think and it really
makes Christmas Christmas I love it the
next things are the Yankee Candles I was
gonna say lush again the next things I
don't you can do some more jars because
I know large jars and medium jars are a
bit more on the expensive side therefore
I think small jars are a really nice
present to give to again a sister your
mom or your cousin I just love Yankee
Candles some of my favorite scents
around Christmas time are snowflake
cookie and Christmas cookie because I
love the sweet scents more than the
other scents what are the other scents
spicy cents I think I get oh well I just
love sweet scents and also softer Karen
oh just like the really warm cozy sense
at Christmas time I think they're the
perfect Christmas present to give and
again there are only eight pounds or
sometimes you can get them on offer for
cheap as well on places like Amazon so
it's amazing the next things are from
Zoey Zoey Beauty range and Tanya Beauty
range because recently they are brought
out brand new beauty stuff and it is
amazing so me just put out Christmas
sets and so is Tanya so I really like
Zoey use
cozy toes Christmas set it just comes
with a little like to buy come and
what's in it it might be the shower gel
I'm not sure and a pair of socks and I
really really like this set I put this
on my Christmas list because I think
it's beautiful and I'm not sure how much
is I think it's 8 or 10 pounds but I
love this and I would be really happy to
receive that Christmas because it's Zoey
like oh and Tanya has also brought out
the most amazing Christmas sets I
believe there are some for 4 pounds and
those of the six pounds and it
coming these cute little like candy
houses and you can get her lipsticks and
lipsticks lip glosses and eyelashes in
them and I love them so much I actually
got her I've been calendar like the 12
days of Christmas to start off in the
middle open because I absolutely love it
and I just could not buy it but couldn't
not buy it I think that made sense it
was 15 pounds but I love it and yet Zoe
and Tanya I've done the most amazing
things this Christmas and I love them so
much I would definitely recommend those
have a present for your friends now if
you did want to spend a bit more on your
mum or your best friend I think Mac and
benefit have some really nice things so
Mac Christmas sets are quite expensive
so you could kind of go towards maybe a
matte lipstick because matte lipsticks
are always really really nice presents
to receive and give and I personally
love them and I'm sure a lot of people
would love to receive one of them on
Christmas as well
oh we cook obviously because they're
15/15 they are a bit more expensive
therefore probably for like a best
friend or your mom or so many who really
means a lot to you and you want to spend
a bit more on them at Christmas but yeah
I really really like those gift set and
I think not gift set lipsticks auntie
they're definitely worth the money the
next gift set is from benefit now
benefit gives that a quite expensive at
Christmas but they always do gifts that
every Christmas which I received last
year and it includes two mini tins and
two of the penny bombs and free so it
comes with baby bomb and posy bomb and
then Bernie tint and posy tint in mini
and it is 20 pounds to buy but it
retails are something ridiculous like 45
so it's a really really good offer to
get look that's hot that's cheaper than
half price and again I feel that the
president would kind of me for somebody
who means a lot to you anyone spend a
bit more on them because obviously it is
that bit more expensive but it is a
really really nice gift to give and also
to receive like that is a really nice
present if you still wanted to kind of
buy like a makeup gift set there are two
gift sets that I think would be perfect
so the first one is from Maybelline and
they recently bought out some winter
edition Baby Lips there's three to
choose from but they've actually bought
them out in like a Christmas gift set as
well and it's 10 pounds and you just get
all three of them and a littles I think
you get something out in there I'm not
too sure they so so pretty and I've
asked without my Christmas
list because they still want some that I
need but I can't actually find it
anywhere but it's so so pretty and
they're called the winter delight Baby
Lips and I think that's a really nice
present if somebody's really into makeup
but maybe you didn't want to buy
high-end and I think that's just a
perfect present finally the last present
is from Too Faced and I recently found
this and I'm so glad I did because I am
now obsessed with it and I really really
would like to receive this at Christmas
and it is he to face melted nude gifts
there so it's 12 pounds and it comes
with a deluxe mini of the Too Faced
melted and there's three different
shades to choose on is like a purpley
shade of pink shade in a nude shade and
then whatever lipstick shade you choose
you get the matching Too Faced melted
blusher which I've never seen before I
think they were exclusive it's these
Christmas sets and it's only 12 pounds
which is a lot cheaper than buying the
melted and a blusher separately which
would range at like 45 so you can get
these from Debenhams
I will link all of these down below so
you can go and get them if you want to
but they are amazing and I really really
love this set and I would love to
receive this so that is the end of my
Christmas gift guide for girls I really
hope this was helpful you could you
could use this to go my present or you
could use it to put on your Christmas
list but we also have to remember that
Christmas isn't just about receiving and
giving presents is Auto about being with
family and being with people that you
love and just having a really good time
and appreciating the real meaning of
Christmas this is just a helpful video
because I know some people get stuck
especially I didn't want to buy people
but this I think this is really helpful
because all of these presents are pretty
not common but really good beauty
presents to give and I would love to
receive them so I really hope you enjoy
the video let me know if you did by
giving this video a huge thumbs up and
I'm also going to leave a link down
below to future points and this is just
an app where you can get free Amazon
gift cards I leave my link in the
description all the time if you do want
to go check that out the link will be
down below because it's always helpful
if you need a bit of extra money at
Christmas and I will leave what you have

next video bye
