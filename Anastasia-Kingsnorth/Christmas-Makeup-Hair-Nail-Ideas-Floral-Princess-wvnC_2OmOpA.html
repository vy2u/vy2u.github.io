going to be doing an easy Christmas hair
makeup and nails idea video so I hope
you enjoy it and let's get started to
begin the Christmas makeup look I primed
my face with the Too Faced primed and
poreless which is my new favorite primer
this primer is like heaven to face is
one of my favorite makeup brands and
I've recently been using their primer
and it is just beautiful
ok it is just beautiful next up is my
concealer and I decided just to go
straight in with concealer instead of
using a heavy duty foundation because
it's Christmas and I can only let my
skin breathe so I just went in with my
collection lasting perfection concealer
which is the only concealer I used sadly
and I just went in with your techniques
sponge I don't know what it's called and
I just sponged sponged dabbed all of
this in to my skin
to mattify the literally best concealer
in the world I went in with my Rimmel
stay matte powder and I'll just use my
room techniques powder brush and buffed
that all into my face to set my base
makeup
for blush and highlight I decided to go
with a palette that I've actually
recently bought and it is the collection
blush and bronze palette I believe it's
called so I just use the bottom right
blusher and I just put this on the apple
of my cheeks rising up towards my
cheekbones and then I just use the
highlighter which is the most gorgeous
highlighter I really use the I really
use sorry I cannot speak I normally use
the mary lou manizer but I've been using
this recently and I've been loving it so
I just pop that on my face for our eyes
I wanted to go with a palette that I
don't really talk about and this is the
wet and wild walking on eggshells trio
which is the palette I wanted for years
and now it's sitting in my Alex drawers
on touch so I decided to get it out and
use it I just put all of the pastel pink
shade which is meant for the lid on the
lid and then I use the brown shade in my
crease and just blended that all out and
I really loved this palette and I feel
like a neglected it for a long time so I
should definitely been using this in
more tutorials
as I said earlier on in the video I've
been loving to face recently so I
usually Too Faced better than sex
mascara which is guys just look at my
eyelashes it's the best mascara in the
world and I love it
and I bet you didn't believe me when I
said I love Too Faced but yet again I'm
using another two-faced product and it
has been melted I'm not sure what shade
this in so I'll just leave it down below
but this trade it's just gorgeous
I love it and then finally I went in for
my NYX matte finish spray and I just
spread that all over my face and then my
mascara smudged underneath my eye which
was brilliant and that is the finished
makeup look you know it's not like
perfect but I really like it it would
look very natural-looking which is what
I wanted to go for so yeah that's the
finish makeup look
so for hair there are two different
hairstyles you can do and they're the
simplest hairstyles in the whole world
because I'm not creative at all when it
comes to hair so the first one is a low
pony with curly ends this is really
really simple and at Christmas time I
love to have my hair out my face which
is why I do this so much and plus it
takes like 30 seconds which is amazing
if you're running late and yeah I just
really love this ponytail I do love the
ponytail I was meant to say hair style
as I said I couldn't speak and I think
it just looks really nice and natural
really and then finally the other
hairstyle isn't really a hairstyle
because like I said I'm not that
creative when it comes to hair but this
is basically just down and messy with
curly ends you can try and plat it
around the edges or you can do french
braids
I was just messing about but I love
having my hair down and curly and messy
especially if I'm going to a party so
they are my two hairstyles
and finally for my nails I will this SEO
Bahama Mama nail polish which is
gorgeous I love Essie nail polishes and
barium nail polishes they are my
favorite and this polish just screamed
Christmas at me so once I had my nails
done I was ready for my day out in
London so I really hope you enjoyed this
video let me know if I did by giving it
a huge thumbs up and let's see if we can
reach 5,000 likes I love you all so much
and I will see you in next week's video
bye
