going to be doing my current Beauty
favorites I literally never do favorite
videos on my channel so I thought I
would just do one containing all of my
favorite beauty products that I've been
loving at the moment this is gonna be a
range from like makeup to skincare to
hair things just all over beauty and I
hope you enjoy it I'm gonna start off
with all of my makeup your favorites
so the first favor I have is this NYX
blush so I have been absolutely adoring
this this is the NYX rose garden blusher
and it's just a stunning rosy pink with
a ton of glitter undertones I'm
literally obsessed with this and Lily
actually bought this for me for our
Scott box but I believe they're around 6
pounds to buy I'm gonna try and link all
of this stuff down below but honestly I
absolutely love this blush I have it on
now I think it's kind of wore off
because I've been filming all day but
absolutely love this blush and this is
definitely one of my current favorite
another Beauty favor that I've been
loving this month is the benefit roller
lash mascara so this is the miniature
version because the big version isn't
actually out yet I got this with like
free with the Elle magazine and this is
just amazing I'm definitely going to be
buying the 4 sides as soon as it comes
out I think I'm actually going to
pre-order it because I'm literally
obsessed I just absolutely love this I
cannot get over it it's just the best
mascara ever it just curls them doesn't
make them to clumpy it can if you want
it to like you can layer and layer it
but overall I'm loving this I've also
been recently loving the Revlon at lack
of arms so I have three of these I have
a like just bitten kissable balm but the
lacquer bombs are my absolute favorite
so I have 3 I have whimsical demure and
then amber for Valentine's Day is one of
my presents got me a provocative
provocative something like that and this
is just a gorgeous I've only used it
once I still kept the label on it but
it's just a gorgeous like ready deep red
color and then this one is just a very
possibly nude
and then this one is a purple amber
actually bought me this one as well or
just dropped it because she knows how
much I love these these are like I don't
even know they're beautiful always
absolutely love I don't think I could
live without these in my makeup
collection they're about eight pounds
each but obviously Revlon do sometimes
have off a lot offers on where they're
like two for ten pounds so honestly you
definitely need to try these if you
haven't already another lip products
that I'm currently loving is the L'Oreal
collection exclusive preview lipsticks
and this is the color each Julie and
nude one so I've used this so much you
can actually completely tell it's quite
far back from the camera but it's so
like worn down now there's only that
much left in it because I've used it so
much this is just the perfect nude I
actually have it on today so it's just
like the gorgeous perfectiy pink color
and it's so so nude I just loved it so
much I could wear this every day is my
everyday color because it's gorgeous
and the packaging just reminds me so
much of really expensive makeup I don't
know why but I just think the package
intoo gorgeous and these are only around
six seven pounds I know the current
favorite are Bath and Body Works pocket
backs so my favorite one at the moment
isn't even in the berry sorbet one so
Alicia or ELISA bought me this her name
is flora kiss and she sent it to me I
absolutely love this I've used quite a
bit actually I've rarely ever used them
because I like to keep them safe but
I've actually used it loads it just
smells amazing it's very strawberry I
don't know it's really really nice and
it's pink it's pastel pink so my
favorite and you can get these off eBay
or Amazon especially eBay that's where I
buy mine from but honestly I've been
loving this so much recently
I then have a couple of hair favorites
so my first one is this and it's the
john frieda she blonde crystal hold
hairspray so a lot of you said to me
that I don't have blonde hair I actually
do but it's just on camera makes a go
darker like if you met me on pet in
person on Sunday at Tanya Birds meter
you're probably thinking yeah you do
have really blonde hair because a lot of
people commented it but I just bought
this because I wanted my hair to go like
a lot lighter blonde and this has
definitely been helping
it smells really good as well so your
hair always felt was really good when
you have this and I think I'm gonna buy
the full version because I'm currently
loving my other hair favorite is the
Ruth Curley collab dry shampoo and this
is the paris floral fragrance this is
the one with the red lid and it just has
a rose pattern at the bottom and if i
can get it open oh my gosh it smells so
nice it smells so floral e and I really
like this like combination of dry
shampoo I just think it's really really
good
it just gets away they like the greasy
patches straightaway this cow was about
$1.99 so obviously it's a bit more
expensive than other dry shampoos but
the big cans are only about to power 15
so I think I'm gonna buy a big cam
because I've been using this every other
day when I don't wash my hair my next
favorite is skincare so this is the
Garnier micellar cleansing water so I've
mentioned this several different times
and I've actually used quite a bit of
this bottle this is my second or third
bottle now and I just use this to remove
my makeup I don't like to rub too hard I
just rub in gentle circular motions and
it just gets my makeup off straight away
I always get this one it's on offer
because normally it's around five to six
pounds but when it's only like 2 or 3
pounds I always buy it and it smells
really good as well so it's probably a
bit on a cotton pad and hover over my
makeup and it just comes straight off it
cleanses Suzanne removes it all in one
and you can use it on your eyes as well
which I really like a favorites for like
body Lee skincare so funny when I say
that is soap &amp;amp; Glory at the moment so
this is the soap &amp;amp; Glory the
award-winning smoothie star breakfast
scrub I have got this for Christmas and
I've used quite a bit actually it smells
so nice honestly this is one of the best
breakfast scrubs or scrubs I've ever
tried don't think I can live without
this now because I use this about 2 to 3
times a week and it just gets rid of all
my dry skin I use this all over my body
on my legs arms and top area and I just
really really like this it's only about
8 pounds as well so for a big tub I
think it's really reasonable price my
next favorite is actually another makeup
favourite but I forgot to mention it is
my Naked 3 palette I got this in a crop
box from Lily and it is my favorite
palette like so I'm just gonna turn them
around it doesn't blind you but it comes
with 12 gorgeous colors
my favourites are dust buzz and factory
I love dust especially it's just this
gorgeous like parsley just put all my
their capacity pinky color and it comes
with a double-ended brush as well and
then a mirror just here but honestly I
love this palette so much especially
because we're coming up to spring now I
feel like I can definitely use this a
lot more my two final favorites are my
brush favorites so these both are real
techniques because these are practically
the only brushes that I use so the first
one is the buffing brush and I'm
currently using this for my foundation
and concealer I really find it just like
perhaps it on really really well and it
blends it really good because you can
either stipple it all out use circular
motions so two really versatile and yeah
I actually love this I've got this in
the core collection and then the other
brush that I've been loving is the
multitask face brush I've got this in
the Sam's pick set and I just used this
for a blusher as you can see cuz it's
pink
I don't actually use the blush brush for
blusher I use that for powder but this
brush just fits perfectly on the apples
of my cheeks and I can sometimes even
use it to like contour or highlight
because it's that good so honestly this
is probably my favorite real techniques
brush that was all of my current Beauty
favorites I hope you have enjoyed this
video if you would like me to do some
more of these favorites hype videos just
let me know because this was actually so
fun to film and yeah thumbs it up if you
enjoyed it and I'll see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
