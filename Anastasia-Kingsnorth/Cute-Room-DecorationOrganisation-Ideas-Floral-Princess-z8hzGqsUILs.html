doing a room decoration and organization
video so I hope you enjoy it and let's
just get started
so my first decoration idea is getting a
warm and fluffy rug so my mogul is from
Ikea and is a faux sheepskin rug and it
was 10 pounds and it's so soft and so
fluffy that it just adds a warm feeling
to my room next an organization idea is
using these IKEA skewer pops so mine are
in pink and white and I also have a
smaller white one and you can really put
anything in these as you can see here I
like to put some of my soap and glory in
them or you could put lip balms and
Yankee Candles yo s lip balm baby lips I
also put my pocket backs in them as it's
such an easy and accessible way to store
things another decoration idea is adding
pretty flowers to your room so I got
this milk bottle shaped bars for a pound
from Ikea and these pink and white
flowers from Tesco Express and they are
so nice and just add a pop of color to
my room and my outside table another
inexpensive way of decorating is adding
a card jar air freshener
so it sounds kind of weird but it's
actually a really good idea I bought
this yongi candle car jar in pinks and
hung it on my bed and it smells so good
and it's also a really nice decoration a
good storage idea is using storage boxes
I got these storage boxes for 3 pounds
from Ikea and they're just a pink candy
man stripe and I put them under a table
and as you can see here I just put my
soap and glory in them and it's such a
good way to store things so if your
windowsill or a shelf is looking pretty
bare you could decorate it so I used a
pink mascara pot on the left side and a
right pretty photo frame on the right
side and then in the middle I just put
this love a sign from Primark which is a
pound and then added two candle dishes
from Ikea another storage idea is using
old mugs or glasses so I actually have
this mug which is called poco in pink
from Ikea so you could put anything in
these as you can see here I put Yankee
candles in them but I actually think it
is a really good holder for makeup
brushes as it's easily accessible to
your makeup brushes and looks really
nice my final idea is redecorating boxes
I actually decorated this one with some
paper I got from home bargains and then
I just put all of the lush little bits
what you get in gift set boxes at the
bottom I actually put all of my pink and
white lush items in this as it looks so
nice on my rug or next to my rug and I
really really like it so thank you very
much for watching I hope this video was
helpful to you in some kind of way and I
hope you have enjoyed watching and don't
forget to subscribe bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
