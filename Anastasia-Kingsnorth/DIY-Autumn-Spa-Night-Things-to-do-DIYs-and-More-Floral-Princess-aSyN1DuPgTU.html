going to doing my DIY autumn at home spa
night so all of you guys say that you
absolutely love my pamper routines my
different season pump routines and I
feel like it is the perfect time now to
do my autumn one because you know
gotta love autumn I don't know about you
but autumn is my absolute favorite
season are just enough autumn and spring
they're my two favorite seasons but
autumn because how cozy everything is
all of the jumpers the hot chocolates
the autumn Rangi candles just don't even
going side I just love everything in
autumn and I actually cannot wait to
film this video so in this video I'm
going to be talking you through my
autumn pamper night because it's a
little bit different to every other
season and I'm also going to be showing
you a few different DIYs that you can do
while having your pump and I so I hope
you enjoyed the video and let's get
started okay so the first thing I will
do on an autumn pump and I it's just
coming to my room and if I've been out
I'll just take my shoes off to my bag
off just do a bit of rewinding and then
I will come and sit on my bed and sit on
my phone for a little while I absolutely
love going on my phone it is essentially
to be honest I don't know what I
couldn't would do without it I'm just so
addicted to my phone which is a bad
thing but I would just got my phone
check all of my social medias which I
link down below little so for mo there
I'm getting very close to 60,000
followers on Instagram and 10,000
followers on Twitter as well so yeah
I'll just sit on my snapchat Instagram
Twitter YouTube I'll catch up on a few
YouTube videos that I've missed and I
will just love doing that and I'll do
that for a good half an hour to an hour
so once I finally realized that I should
probably get off my phone and do
something a bit more productive in my
pamper evening I will actually get up
and I have this little box underneath my
bed and it's full of cleaning products
because I love love love cleaning my
room on a pump and I always have to
clean my room before I really do
anything else so I would just get some
like little cloths I get from Wilkinson
and I will just wipe over all of the
things in my room and I'll just polish
clean my windows organizer make
make my bed if I didn't do that already
and I will just make my room very very
ready for a perfect evening at this
point I will also light some candles as
well because I love lighting candles and
where is it here I always liked my
yankee candle sugar apple jar because
this is the most oh my gosh gorgeous
smelling yankee candle jar and i
actually cannot wait till christmas time
comes so i can get some more Christmas
Yankee Candles as well so yes I would do
that I know just you know make sure
everything is clean and tidy and then I
will also make a little separate area in
my bed but it's all cozy with loads of
cushions and it's just all pretty
because then when I've come for the
bathroom it's just heavenly so once I've
done that this is where I'm gonna show
you the two different DIYs so I have to
do I see you
one is a body scrub slash lip scrub so
it works for both and the other one is
the other one all my marks that came out
so chavvy the other one is a chocolate
face mask
so I personally find when I watch this
type of videos a lot of the DIYs are
using perks I don't actually have in my
house like oh that's because I just
don't like oats or coconut oil I find I
don't really have these types of things
in my own home so I decided to come up
with these DIYs which I got a few off
the internet and made them my own which
to be honest you're probably gonna have
all these things around the house ok so
I'm gonna start off with the body scrub
slash lip scrub so you literally need
three items you need granulated sugar
you can use brown sugar or you can use
normal sugar it's completely up to you
whatever suits your preference then you
need honey and you also need a little
bit of vegetable oil you can also add a
scent in if you want or a color it won't
stain you but I decided to leave my I
got the color it turned out because it
was very very natural that way the
measurements are completely up to you
all idea that was I think I put like 5
or 6 tablespoons of sugar into a bowl I
then just added 2 to 3 tablespoons of
honey and I mix that all together and
then it added a little bit of vegetable
oil and it made the perfect consistency
of a scrub I'm so excited to use this
tonight because I love DIY scrubs
they're all natural and perfect for the
skin so it is amazing as I said you can
use it on your lips and you can use on
your body as well and you think the
honey would be sticky but it is not it
is so moisturized
so yeah that is the first DIY the second
DIY is a DIY chocolate facemask so again
all you need for this is granulated
sugar white or brown is completely up to
you cocoa powder but I actually used a
hot chocolate powder which i think is
cocoa powder a hand honey
so as I said all you want to do is mix
the sugar and honey together again
however much you need however much you
want and then you just want to add a
little bit of the cocoa powder in or a
lot of the cocoa powder and if you want
it to be very very chocolatey so this
face mask is a bit more of a scrubby
ones if you want a more silky smooth one
look in the description box and I will
have a little recipe for a smooth one
down there as well so once I've done
those I will actually go put them both
in the fridge until I'm ready to use
them because I find they work better at
colder temperatures than room
temperature so now I my DIYs are done I
will go into the bathroom and start to
run my bath so I'll just use some lush I
will add a ton of bubbles I would like
some candles I also seem to leave it and
it's a bit darker to have my bath
because I have a big windows no curtains
or blinds in my bathroom and I want it
to be dark so well I like candles the
candles will just light up the room so I
always wait it's about eight or nine
o'clock to have my bath and I will just
put loads of bubbles in make it really
deep and warm and steamy and I will just
make it lovely it also puts so many
candles around the bath so whilst my
bath is running and I'm doing all that
because it takes a good 15 to 20 minutes
to run fully could put it on quite
slowly so the water comes out hotter I
will do my skincare so if I might makeup
I will remove it with the little
cleansing polish if I'm not wearing
makeup I will skip this step see ya are
using this all cleanser points just to
remove all of her makeup and polish my
face up and then if I have any excess
makeup I will use the lizard skin tonic
and I'll just put this on a cotton pad
and rub it all over my face and it's
amazing this video isn't sponsored but
honestly I love to serve skincare I
would definitely recommend you go check
it out and then I will also usually this
out soothing I notion again I'll just
pop this on a cotton pad and one on each
eye and just circular motions so once
I've done that I will then get in the
bath and if you actually want your pores
to be cleaned out and opened
I really recommend
a really hot bath and just put in your
head face down like that and your portal
open and clean out with the steam of the
bath but it's so good
are you literally the clog and the dirt
that comes out of your pores is
disgusting
when you look you don't even realize
until you've done it so yeah I just
learned to do that in the bath and then
I would just use my scrub from earlier I
will make sure my legs are all shaved I
will wash my body
I'll possibly use a block of shower
cream bath cream and just make myself
already pampered I make myself feel
really clean and fresh I'm awesome in
the bath as well I would sometimes just
go on my phone read a book read a
magazine
I always feel a bit more relaxed if I
read a magazine especially one that
talks about autumn jumpers and autumn
Yankee Candles so once I've done in the
bath I will then go out the bath and
just moisturize my body oh I'll probably
use like a soap and or moisturizer
because I find the soap &amp;amp; Glory ones are
the best for my skin they really make it
smell and it's not just a oh it will
wear off in half an hour smell it's a
really long last it's all that you would
smell like the next day on your body so
when I'm done now also just clean the
bathroom up so it's not messy our mum
doesn't have to do it and then I would
just head into my room and check my
phone again where's my phone is all
checked and I'm all up to date on social
media
I will then Co now says and get a drink
and a snack okay now I know it is autumn
now and I feel like in summer it would
be more appropriate to have some fresh
snacks like strawberries carrots
cucumber but it's getting colder now and
I feel like we should go into a bit more
the unhealthy chocolatey side of things
therefore I will have a hot chocolate
with a ton of whipped cream and
chocolate sprinkle on the whipped cream
because you can never have too much
chocolate on a hot chocolate and I will
then get a snack as well which is
probably going to be chocolate I would
have had a brownie but I finished them
this morning so I can't have a brownie
but I will just have some chocolate like
a flake or something galaxy counters and
I'll just bring those upstairs and have
those again while I'm watching movies so
my first website to go on is Netflix
because Netflix is my number one movie
site I absolutely love it and I will
always head straight to the comedy
section
if those are pretty little lies episodes
I haven't watched I would watch that but
at the moment I'm all caught up so I
will go to the comedy section and my top
three films on the comedy section are
one identity thief because I think
that's amazing to just go with it and
three grownups too as you can see I love
Jennifer Aniston and Adam Sandler they
are just my favorite
then I favorite favorite actors but I
just love them so much their movies are
so funny so yeah I would just sit down
watch some of those movies just chill
out and just maybe go bed early but I
feel so relaxed so I really hope you
enjoyed my autumn pamper routine let me
know if you're going to try some of the
DIYs I thought it would be nice included

talking you through my pamper routine
because then you can actually go and try
to emptyeye wise as well with themes

downstairs so I really hope you enjoyed
