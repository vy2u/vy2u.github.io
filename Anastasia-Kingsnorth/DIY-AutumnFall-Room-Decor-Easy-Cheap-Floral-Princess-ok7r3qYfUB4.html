going to be doing a DIY tumblr autumn
room decor video so I asked you guys on
my Instagram what you wanted to see and
literally tumblr room decor and autumn
room decor was the most requested video
I kind of already been planning to do
one of these but I always get it if you
would I do DIY room decor videos I'm
like what can I do like how can make
them pretty cheap so that you guys can
recreate them as well but I think I'll
come up with really good ideas this time
but yeah so today I'm going to be doing
a DIY autumn room decor video but
instead of just colored an intro and
then going straight into it I thought I
would sit down and talk you guys through
the DIYs and overlay clips of how to do
this because I thought that would be a
bit different and a bit more fun so I
can have a proper long chat with you
guys also just a quick a huge thank you
for 90,000 subscribers what is even like
about 10,000 away from 100,000 like
that's crazy
I'm so excited I cannot thank you guys
enough but without further ado I'm going
to get straight into the DIYs and the
ways you can make a room or to me
because that's probably what you're
looking forward to most
so the first DIY I'm going to start off
with are these really cute DIY little
pumpkins so you will need some Polisario
pumpkins some paint a sharpie what else
do you need to tape if you're going to
do patterns and all of things like that
I will leave at what you need over the
screen here so I decided to get my
copper paint and I decided just to paint
one of the whole pumpkins copper I
thought this looked amazing and because
I've added a bit more copper and rose
gold into my room now I thought they did
really benefit my room especially but
it's kind up to Halloween with all the
pumpkins so you could to do a chevron
pattern if you wanted to so I included
tape in there what you need you could
just put the tape in a chevron pattern
and paint the paths but it doesn't have
tape take the tape off and you will have
a chevron design I'm planning on doing
that after this video but for the
purpose of this video I decided just to
paint mine completely copper
I literally loved how this turned out so
much and I actually have it on my shelf
up there and it just looks so so pretty
and so Ottoman all and the other pumpkin
is kind of like a man's down a pumpkin
so you just need the same things but
you'll just need a sharpie this time so
this is kind of freestyle and it's
completely up to you what you want to do
with it
but I decided just to start off by
drawing a little heart in the stem and
then some dots around the stem and then
I decided just to do this like twirly
flower pattern and I've added some
triangles colors some of them in black
then I added kind of the classic mandala
edging when I'd finished and I went
about halfway down the pumpkin and I
really liked how this turned out again
this looks amazing next to the coppery
rose gold one all my shelves and it just
looks so so pretty and I think it's
perfect for my type of room as well
because obviously my room is kind of
like pink white and gray so adding a bit
of that color into it instead of adding
orange is really nice so now I'm moving
on to the second DIY which is probably
the easiest actually and that is it
tattooed candles so you will need some
candles you can either use candles in
glass jars or you can use block candles
it's up to you you will also need some
flash tattoos because who doesn't love
flash tattoos and then you also need
some like wet damp tissue paper all I
kept chin roll or anything like that
so all you want to do is pick out your
flasher two designs I'll leave the link
to where I got mine down below that I
just got twelve sheets off of ebay for
three pounds and they came with the most
amazing designs they came with mandalas
they came with well so they come with
little dream catchers loads of notes and
like arrows just love them and they were
all gold and silver which was really
really nice as well so obviously that
will match the star of the room I'm
going for so all you need to do is cut
the design out of the tattoo that you
want so just cut around the tattoo
edging off of the sheet making sure you
leave the plastic covering on then just
want to tear the plastic covering away
and pop it onto the candle I did a block
candle first and of course you probably
not gonna want to burn these because you
don't know how it's gonna turn out so
this is more as kind of decoration the
you know just want to Pat it onto the
candle and just go over with your wet
paper towel and dab it on for around 30
seconds just until you feel like that is
enough for the tattoo to have
transferred onto the candle once you've
done that you just want to tear away the
tattoo paper left and you should be left
with the most gorgeous candle you've
ever seen literally I feel this is like
the
perfect tumblr room decor item yeah it's
so inexpensive that candle literally
cost me 30 P from Ikea and one of those
tattoos at the 3 pound sheet by P like
35 P for that candle incredible and then
I went ahead and did it again but this
time I did it on a glass jar in a candle
because this cannot actually wanted to
be able to burn so again this one was
only 50 P from Ikea and then the tattoo
was like 5 P it was out so I just did
exactly the same again I just dabbed it
with some wet paper towel and dabbed it
onto there and then just took it away
and I have this gorgeous little hand
pattern and I love this it was gold
silver and blacks it was a bit of a
mixture compared to the dreamcatcher
which was just gold and I just
absolutely loved it it's just so so
pretty on my shelves
they look amazing next to some flowers
and next to some other DIYs just
absolutely love them and I would
definitely recommend that you guys do
these and send me pictures on Instagram
or Twitter because I absolutely love
them they are insane be nice so for my
final DIY I don't really know what to
call it but I saw Lord DIY do it but she
did a spring version so I decided to
show you guys a bit of a cheaper way of
doing an autumn version so it's like a
photo frame which you can turn into like
a photo hanging wall so you'll need a
photo frame some string some pushpins a
hammer and some pictures to hang on to
it I just got my pictures from photo lab
which is an app I will leave at my code
to get 5 pounds free of pictures down
below but so the first thing I did was I
just took the back off of my photo frame
so there was nothing left in it
literally just the plain white photo
frame and then just measured out some
Brown string to the length I needed I
made sure there was a little bit extra
so just in case I went wrong I could
move along and then cut the excess off
at the end then all you want to do is
grab your pushpin and you just want to
push it through the string into the
little wooden bit of the photo frame and
just hammer that down wait until it is
flat make sure it is flat and then do
not stop hammering and then it is flat
how many times I just say you need to
make the choice flap I don't know but
you don't just want to do that to the
other side and you can add as many
layers of string as you wanted I just
let the two but of course you could add
for your fall once you've done that you
just want to
all of the things back into the back of
photo frame so I just added a plain
white piece of paper my clear acrylic
covering and then I've sang with you
back of the photo frame you don't want
to turn it around and I actually got
these mini wooden pegs from Wilkinson's
and I just hooked up some of my pictures
on there and it looks so pretty like
it's over there in my room and I just
love it so much because obviously you
can swap and change everything you have
on there you can have post-it notes even
flash tattoos like why not it just looks
amazing and I love it so much and it was
so inexpensive I also thought I would
show you guys some other little things
you can do around your room so as I said
I love getting copper things and new
cushions and new little ornaments so I
do it tiger and I picked up a few copper
things because they have the most
amazing copper things I've got this
gorgeous little copper basket with some
cactuses the copper basket was only
three pounds which is like a bargain for
a basket and I just got these cute
little candles and just everything like
that and I also got this amazing cushion
from Gaby's range at Primark I actually
went to Primark yesterday and they had
it and I was like oh my god I thought it
was all sold out so I just bought it and
it's just like a rose gold sequin
cushion which I love so yeah it just
added some other colours into a room I
reckon there goes the coppers and grades
because I think they're the nicest
colors for autumn so that was my DIY
autumn room decor video I really hope
you enjoyed it it was little bit of a
different way of showing you some autumn
room decor but I feel like it was a
really effective way and it was very
kind of original so let's see if we can
