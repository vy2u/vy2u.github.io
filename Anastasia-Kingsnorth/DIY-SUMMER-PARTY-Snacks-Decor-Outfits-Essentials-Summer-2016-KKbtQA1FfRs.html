going to be doing a DIY summer picnic
slash summer party so I am genuinely so
excited for this video because me and
I'm going out filming today we went to
like a local park and we just had a huge
summer picnic party just us two and it
was so so nice so we thought we would do
like a DIY video to show you kind of how
we set it up some snacks and some like
DIY decorations so yeah Amber's also
done a video over on her channel so I'm
going to link that down below and if I
can I will link it on the screen as well
if you are on a laptop so definitely go
and check her video out it should be out
either at the same time as mine or later
one of the day as her upload time is
later on on a Sunday but yeah I really
hope you enjoy the video and let's get
started so to start off our summer
picnic we started off by laying down a
blanket so we just got a white sheet
from a bed cover set and we just laid
this down on the ground we went for a
white one because our color theme was
pink and gold and we thought white would
match best the next thing you need to do
for your perfect summer picnic is make a
DIY Garland these are really expensive
but it's so inexpensive to make so all
you need is a tissue paper string and
then some like golden foil ribbon as I
said they were so cheap and easy to make
so all I did was started off by cutting
the tissue paper into strips leaving a
load of it at the top if that makes any
sense I then just folded it together all
in a bunch I didn't want to scrunch it
up so I just folded it instead and then
I just fold it over the top to make a
loop I then just took the gold with foil
and wrapped it around the top just to
leave a hole where I could thread it
through the string and then once I done
all that I straighted them on and it
looks so good I love how this turned out
and it just looks amazing against our
backdrop
moving on with the decorating I added a
crate and a copper mason jar with some
peonies in I then added my white
Polaroid and his copper light at
pineapple which I got from Primark and I
love this and then I decided to make a
DIY spray-paint pineapple I guess you
could call it it's basically just
spray-painting a pineapple so all I got
was my pineapple and my spray paint I
decided to use a pastel pink and a
copper color so all I literally did was
spray paint the top half of the
pineapple and this was a lot more
pigmented of the picture I saw on the
internet but nevertheless it still
turned out pretty good and looked really
nice against our backdrop and I would
definitely recommend doing this moving
on with the food part so of course you
have to have food at a picnic so me
number work with kind of the classics we
got a tray of doughnuts army got
watermelon and strawberries I feel like
these are kind of plastic picnic foods
and we both love them so we decided to
go for these foods and then we just
choose our doughnut it's like normal
people and we just had a really really
nice day it was so relaxing and I
definitely recommend doing this
I then decided to show you guys how I
made this Herbert lemonade bottle it was
so simple all I did was get a smart
water bottle and printed off the
Herbert's lemonade label I actually
realized it says who Bert's not Herbert
oops so all I did was remove the label
off of my water bottle and as it was
already sticky I didn't actually need
glue and I just stuck it down and I
absolutely love this this is a
simplicity I why in the world but a lot
of American people have these and I
really really want one it would look
even better if you added pink lemonade
into it oh my god it would look so cute
now I thought it would be nice to show
you my summer essentials as I never
rarely do this the first one is my Kylie
lip kit this is in candy Kay and I love
this so much the pigmentation is amazing
and the consistency is beautiful my next
essential is my nyx concealer palette I
love this I've recently got this so you
will be seeing in a hole soon but it is
so good the pigmentation of the top
right one is exactly what I need to
cover my spots and I love it so much and
my next essential and my final essential
is my Maybelline lash sensational
luscious oil blend mascara this is a
recent gift from Maybelline and I love
it so much this is so good my eyelashes
just go pure black with it and I love it
for the summer time finally for my
outfit basically all of it is from
misguided apart from the shoes so the
skirt is from misguided the top is from
misguided and my shoes are from hmm I
love this outfit so summery and I never
usually wear things like this which is
why I love it so much and yeah that is
basically my outfit and that is the end
of the video so that was the end on my
video I really really hope you enjoyed
it if you did give it a huge thumbs up
and let's see your biggest fashion
10,000 like so much 10,000 likes and I
will do a load of summer videos our
