to be a DIY it spring room decor video
these videos are always so requested and
I decided to go out buy some new stuff
and do one for you so if you enjoy it
make sure you give it a huge thumbs up
and I hope you enjoy the video so the
first step to making these is going on
the internet and finding a
black-and-white quote that you like so I
just picked one that says be true to who
you are and then I just picked up my
photo frame and took the back off of it
and just put it in the frame like you
would do with a normal picture obviously
it's springtime now here in England so I
wanted to make it a bit more spring so I
actually got these like fake artificial
roses from eBay and I just decided to
cut the stems off of them and stick them
in each corner I thought this gave it
like a much more spring type of look and
I think it just looks so we heart it
like I absolutely love this I love just
so much I decided to make two and then I
just hung them up on my wall together
and honestly I'm obsessed with these I
think they're so nice I got the frame to
like a pound each and everything in this
DIY was so so good and so so Chi
so to make my shelves look a bit more
spring I decided to add this little
quote plaque and a VARs which are
actually made which I turned into like a
Chanel floral bars and just added I like
in a wooden a which I got from eBay and
I love this to make the Chanel Val's all
you need to do is print off the Chanel
number 5 logo from the internet and then
just get a like a glass from the kitchen
or something that's what I did and I
just stuck it on the bars and then I got
these fake flowers from eBay and I love
these it just looked so so nice and made
my room feel so much more spring-like
another idea to make your room more
spring-like is printing out Polaroids so
that actually an app on the app store
called polar gram which is where you can
order photos in this Polaroid style so I
actually picked out 24 and I just took
them all up on my wall I got some
memories some motivational quotes I've
got a mixture of everything and I'm
going to leave a code for 5 pounds worth
of prints free down below and prints are
only 29 piece you can get a ton free and
to start off with I like collection and
you can just put them up on your wall
and it makes you feel so good and it
just makes you smile to look at it okay
so something else that I have to do
during springtime is organize my
wardrobe to make it more organized so
the first thing I did was went to Ikea
and bought matching coat hangers now all
of my coat hangers are the same and it
really bugs me if they're not and this
is one way to like automatically makes
your wardrobe look so much cleaner and
so much more organized I then organized
her wardrobe so it goes coat jumpers
spring tops like trousers and then
shorts this just makes it so much more
easier to find what I'm looking for and
I also gave a ton of clothes to charity
which is always a really good thing to
do when you're having a clear-out to
organize the bottom of my wardrobe I
just got this white fabric square box
from Ikea and this was only two pounds
fifty and I just thought of my knickers
brass and socks in this I then got my
favorite handbag at the moment which is
my Primark handbag I just put that in
the corner and then I decided to pick
out some dolly shoes which are my go-to
shoes at the moment my two clutch bag
which are both from new look and then I
also have my necklaces
and my flower crown will grow there as
well and I love this and it just reminds
me of we heart it so that is the end of
my spring room decor video thumbs up if
you enjoy because that will really help
me to know if you guys enjoyed the video

moment and I'm really enjoying filming
