a plain brown notebook I just got mine
from Wilkinson's before 25 P you'll also
need some acrylic paint I chose pink and
purple you'll also need a pencil a straw
and a thick black pen so first of all
all you want to do is go on or whatever
you have like a phone a laptop or an
iPad and search up an image of a map
outline you can do this with a printer
as well you can use a stencil but I
don't have a printer and I wanted to
make this video for you so if you don't
have a printer so I basically just drew
it so what you want to do is copy the
image down to be fair it doesn't really
matter how good or bad it is because a
maps a map and it kind of looks like a
map whatever shape you draw it so once
you have drawn all out in pencil you
just want to go over all of that in
black pen
once you have got the outline of your
map the first thing you want to do is
get your paint and basically you just
want to paint a rough edging to the map
and basically tante to get a straw and
blow through it so the key to getting
this perfect is to put the straw very
low down on the paper and then the paint
will spread upwards and not sideways
like mine did a little bit this is the
first time of doing it so I didn't
really know what the technique was but
doing it more and more I definitely got
the technique and definitely add quite a
bit of water because the acrylic paint
just will not spread without you adding
a lot of water you then just want to
repeat the same thing with your pink
paint but just put the pink paint over
at the top of the purple paint just to
give it a bit of ombre effect and once
you have done that all you want to do is
go around the black lines again in black
as if you don't do that it kind of looks
a bit messy and then you have your
notebook I love this one it's very very
different to what I think you can find
shops and it's very original
for the next notebook this is very open
you can choose whatever court you want
it's all you're gonna need again is a
notebook a pencil and that black marker
board pen thing again so all you want to
do is gone again go onto your laptop or
phone wherever you have and search up
black and white quotes you can pick any
quote you want to I prefer getting black
and white ones because they are all on a
white background so you can easily copy
the writing I just chose one that says
actually I can't even remember what it
says but you had to chose one of Google
Images and I basically just roughly
traced it round on a pencil first and I
then just went in with my black marker
and filled it all in I definitely
recommend getting a black marker for
this because it just fills in so much
more quicker than a normal biro pen
would this again this notebook is very
self-explanatory and you can really use
whatever court you want again this is
for the people who don't really have a
printer but of course if you have a
printer you could use a stencil to make
it a bit easier for yourself and the
final notebook is a recreation of lore
DIYs back-to-school notebook last year
so all you're going to need it exactly
the same things in the first one a
notebook two different colors of acrylic
paint a pencil of straw and a black
marker pen sorry I forgot what a straw
was called so all I did it was basically
pack all of the paint onto the left side
of the notebook and I then just blew it
all upwards honestly it doesn't matter
where all these blowings
platters go because you're going to
cover it with a mandala anyway so just
add all the different colors you can use
more than two colors that would look
really cool and just carry on spreading
it out once you've done that all you
want to do is get a plate and you just
want to draw circles on to the book so
this will make the mandala very even and
you just want to do this until you've
got enough circles to create the pattern
you then just want to finish your
mandala by adding in all of the really
cool patterns and you can go really like
freestyle with this you can do whatever
pattern that you feel like doing so that
is the end of my video I really hope you
enjoyed it
thumbs up if you want me to do some more
DIYs and I will see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
