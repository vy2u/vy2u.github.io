hey everyone so for today's video I'm
going to doing a DIY tumblr room decor
so in school time I never really get
time to film these type of videos
because they take so long to film an
edit but as is the Easter holidays right
now I have so much time to do it and I
really wanted to do one of these videos
because they're always so requested and
I've had my eye on like some DIYs I
wanted to do for my room anyway so I
thought it would be fun to share with
you how I did them so you could do the
for your room as well so you guys both
really what I'm going to be doing today
I'm going to be doing three different
DIYs maybe four you could count one two
I suppose but yes that's what we're
doing today I really hope you enjoy the
video and let's get started so to make
this marble tray you will need some
white spray paint a plant dish and a
marble stick a slab I got the marble and
the plant dish from B&amp;amp;Q for two pounds
in total so I started off by speeding
the back off of my marble sticker slab
and all I did was measure how much I
would need I didn't do this the most
effective way as you can see and it
didn't really work so I decided to cut
it down into a smaller circle and
roughly mark out where I needed to cut
to make it fit perfectly once I've done
that I just took my white spray paint
and I spray-painted the whole dish I
didn't really spray-paint the base as
obviously that was going to be covered
in marble and I didn't really want to
waste the spray paint because spray
paint doesn't come cheap these days so I
then just took the marble slab and I
stuck it down in the middle and that was
literally it this is so simple yet
really really effective and it looks so
tumblr these are on Urban Outfitters
for 22 pounds and I made this for a
total of 4 pounds 50 including the spray
paint so how amazing is that and the
beauty of this is you can put exactly
what you want to put on it
I made this into a really cute tumblr
tray with cactuses and stones but it
would be a really good jewelry holder or
a really good lipstick holder as well
you
so to make this amazing Y memo board you
will need some white spray paint some
chicken coop wire which I got from being
key for eight pounds some photos of your
choice and some clips to hang with
photos up with so the first step was to
spray-paint my chicken coop wire as it
was like a dark green color and I really
did not want that so I just spray
painted it all over and as I said I got
this from the outdoor section in being
queue for eight pounds so I just put a
screw into my wall and hung it up and
then I just threaded some fairly light
through and I wanted the fairy lights to
bring it all together and I thought it'd
be quite boring as it is on a white wall
so I needed to add a little something
extra to it I then decided to spray
paints and binder clips and some paper
clips in a copper color and a pink color
as I wanted them to stand out against
the white as I was so much white and I
really liked the turn out of this then
it is time to hang up the photos so I
printed my photos off of an app called
la-la lab and this video isn't sponsored
but if you do want 5 pounds worth of
free print you can use my code on the
screen I will also leave it in the
description box down below and every
time you use that code I get five pounds
and you get five pounds and every time
you download the app you get your own
unique code as well so you can hand out
your friends and get loads of money on
it to order free prints canvases phone
cases and everything like that it is
such a good app and I really do
recommend it as I said this video isn't
sponsored I just genuinely love the app
I then just paper clipped and clipped up
all of my photos and Polaroids and this
completed my memo board I cannot even
begin to say how much I love this and it
just made my room feels so much bigger
and every time somebody comes around I
can take a Polaroid or a photo and they
could sign it and it will just look so
cute
and the final DIY is this DIY reversible
plant pot so all you need is some white
and copper spray paint of course you can
change the colors you'll also need a
black sharpie and a plant pot even
though I got two so I started off by
spraying my plant pots in white even
though I just sprayed two I only decided
to use one and make it reversible so to
make the triangle all you need to do is
lay two pieces of tape down diagonally
making sure the paint is dry because I
made the mistake of doing it when it was
wet I then just very painted inside the
triangle and then when you take them off
it leaves this beautiful crisp triangle
and I love this it looks so cute but
then also if you get bored of that
design I thought it'd be really fun to
make it reversible so all you need to do
is turn around the plant pot and I
decided to do this is a cute face design
so it was literally three curved lines
and then on the top to just draw some
eyelashes and it looks so cute
especially when you put the plant in it
it just I don't know what it looks like
it just looks so tumblr and I really do
love this because it's reversible so if
you buy new room decorations and the one
design doesn't fit you can turn it round
or if you're just not feeling one design
you can turn it round to another and
there's loads of different designs you
could do on this and it's really unique
and different to what I've ever seen
before so I love this
so that was my tumblr room decor I
really hope you enjoyed it
let's see if we can smash 7,000 thumbs
up in the first 48 hours and if we do
I'm going to do a map giveaway in the
next two to three weeks also going to do
a brushes giveaway so like Real
Techniques and possibly a lush giveaway
as well so yeah I really hope you enjoy
the video if you did give it a huge
thumbs up and go read a comment that I'm
going to put in the comment section down
below because I need to ask your opinion
on something
see ya I hope you enjoyed the video give
a thumbs up if you did and I love you
all so much I don't see you my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
