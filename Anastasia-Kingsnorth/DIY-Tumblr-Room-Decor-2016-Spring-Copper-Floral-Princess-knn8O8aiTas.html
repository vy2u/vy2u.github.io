be doing a DIY tumblr room decor so I
recently was sitting on Amazon and I was
like oh my god I really really really
want to do a DIY room decor video and I
found some really amazing things that I
thought would be really good to show you
guys and I'm actually so so excited for
this video so I've made three different
things and I literally love all of them
so much I cannot wait to show you all of
them alo'so excited so yeah I'm going to
be doing a tumblr room decor for 2016 I
really want to do like more DIYs this
year so let me know if you do want me to
do them this is kind of revolved around
that geometric e Tumblr copper that type
of stuff but yeah so I hope you enjoy
the video and let's get into it
so the first thing I'm going to be
showing you how to make is a DIY pastel
jar set so things you will need are some
spray paints any colors of your choice I
just chose copper white and pink and
those are the exact colors on screen and
then you're going to want some Kilner
jars I just got three of them so the
first thing I did was spray each key on
a jar in one of my colors as I said I
chose white pink and copper and I just
gave him a few coats to make sure they
were completely covered
once you have like your jars dry for a
good few hours you are ready to put them
out in your room so I just pop mine on
my shelf and I put these really cool
green and white flowers from tesco in
them and this just reminds me of spring
and I'm so excited to keep these out in
my room I just love them and I think
this is the best DIY I've ever done
okay so the next DIY is this DIY copper
pot but of course you can use in any
color so the first thing you're going to
is some spray paint of course mine was
copper you're also going to need some
scissors and you're also going to need a
pot of some sort you can use a glass
bowl apart I just got my pot from Ikea
and you were also going to need some
tape and I use double-sided tape so the
first thing I did was took my scissors
and my tape and I just started cutting
it up into pieces the reason I use
double-sided was because the top with
white so I could easily see it and it
was a lot easier to hold even though it
wasn't much easier to cut so I just
started cutting that up into strips and
I placed them in just a straight-up kind
of Candyman pattern onto my pot and I
soon realized I added a bit diagonally
by accident but yes so then I just spray
painted it and I let that dry for a
little while
I then went ahead and took all the tape
off once it dried and as you can see it
didn't exactly go the neatest it kind of
looks very rustic in the end but I just
added my part back in and I loved the
finished product
yes so the final DIY is a DIY marble
quote slash picture so you will need
some spray paint again I chose copper
and that is the exact brand and color on
screen you'll also need some scissors
you will need some marble sticker paper
you can print it off online and on
sticker paper but I just ordered mine
and you will also need a sharpie and a
canvas so I started off by spraying the
canvas with copper spray paint in the
middle you don't need to worry about
covering the whole thing and then I just
took my black sharpie and I drew a heart
in the middle of the sticker paper it
doesn't need to be perfect because you
can kneading it out when you're cutting
out but this was just kind of a rough
edging a graphic guideline I guess I
then just decided to cut my marbled
sticker paper down to the exact size I
needed as it was a bit hard to cut it
and it was coming off a roll I will link
it down below and then I just went out
and cut the inside of the heart out so
literally like a template and I just
chucked away in the middle bit of the
heart as I kind of ruined it a little
bit you stuck with me
I then just unpeeled the back from my
marble sticker paper and I just stuck
this down onto the canvas there was a
little copper like scratch that had come
off so I had to repaint it but it looked
so good after and I just popped down the
edges as I cut it a bit too big just so
I didn't cut it too small so I just
folded the edges down and it's finished
I love this so much I see these all over
Google Images and all over everywhere
and tumblr especially and I really
really wanted to make one and I love the
turnout so that was the end on my tumblr
DIY room decor I really hope you enjoy
