video is going to be a DIY we heart it
room decor so personally I've never seen
a wee hearted room decor video and I
just wanted to do one so bad because
I've tried to make my room inspired by
re heart it so in this video I'm just
going to show you a couple of DIYs and
some ideas that you could do to your
room to make it more we heart if I'd I
guess and yeah I hope you enjoy to make
a wee heart it candle holder you'll need
a glass holder some paper a sharpie and
some glue so first of all I just drew
the we heart it picture I wanted or you
could print one out but I thought it
would be more practical to draw it
because I don't have a printer and so if
you may not either so I decided to do
the meat and Wi-Fi one and then I just
cut that out and I just got some pretty
stick and it was pink as well because I
wanted it to match and I just glued that
and stuck it on to the glass jar and
then when I done that I just put a
little like Yankee Candle votive in it
and it was so cute and it just reminded
me of the glass trial I see on We Heart
It
next is a DIY nightstand so I first of
all just added some white flowers
because on my heart I always see flowers
as well as Victoria Secret sprays so
obviously I had to have one on there and
just a matte lipstick because these are
just a typical nightstand and I always
see the next one is their DIY cozy area
so for this I just put my faux sheepskin
rug from Ikea down and I just put a load
of cushions around it so when I just
want to like have a cozy time and just
relax I can just go and sit down here
with my Starbucks and my drink and just
have like a really cozy time and just
watch some youtube videos and just
thought it was a really nice idea
because I don't know it just looks
really pretty in your room as well and
it's just nice way to spice up your room
obviously a typical thing on we heart is
shelves so I just done at this we heart
it shelf I first of all started off by
added by Lauren Conrad beauty book my
Lauren Conrad style book and my next to
chunk it book in like a little stack
from biggest to smallest and then I just
added this life's to his happiness sign
from home bargained with an Ikea candle
and a why sell lipstick and finally an
Ikea candle holder with a Yankee candle
on top I just think this looks so pretty
and it just reminds me of we heart it
like as soon as I see it I'm just like
that's so me hearted the next DIY is a
DIY memory jar so for this DIY you will
need a mason jar with a lid some ribbon
and a sticker and some pen and some long
strips of paper so first of all I just
got this sticker and I wrote 2015
memories on it so then every day I can
write a memory and just put it in the
jar so then I just stuck that on the jar
I then just decided to tie some ribbon
around it to make it look really cute
and I just got this pink and white
ribbon for Christmas with this actual
jar I got like a set and I decided to
make it into this so then once I've done
that I decided to make wish stars so
first of all you write something on the
star then you not the end of it so just
like a normal knot and then you get the
piece of paper and follow it round so
you kind of know I mean when you're
doing it you just follow the way it
wants to bend round until you've got all
of the paper covered and once you've
done that you just pinch all of the
corners and they turn into little stars
and I just Chuck this into the jar and
well I just have a full jar of these and
it will look so pretty and you could do
all different colors and that's that DIY
completed so easy and looks so pretty
the final DIY is this photo string
collage so I first of all - took my old
Glamour magazine and no this is company
and I just ripped out some pages which I
thought looked really cute and then I
just cut them into squares and
rectangles like the pieces that I wanted
and once I cut them into all the shapes
and sizes I decided to get some wooden
pegs and I just pegged like each picture
with one peg I hope that made sense and
then I just added them in between each
very light and I think it looks so
pretty and so cute and this just
reminded me of We Heart It and it's just
hang around my bed and I love it
now we are on to some inspirations of
course fairly light is a big inspiration
on we heart it a room is not complete
without fairy lights and the other
inspiration is these pink boxes so I got
these from Ikea and just store minor and
soap and glory in them and I just keep
these down by my radiator and they look
so pretty that's the end of this video I
hope you have enjoyed it and a room tour
will be coming very soon because I know
that these type of videos are really
requested and this is my first try so
hopefully it turned out ok let me know
what you think and thumbs it up if you
would like to see a room tour or just
thumbs up if you enjoyed and I'll see
you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
