thought I would do a DIY We Heart It
phone cases because I've never ever seen
this before
and I love We Heart It so yeah I hope
you enjoy the video and let's just get
started for the weak-hearted collage I
just went onto the internet and typed
him pink.we hearted transparent and I
just found all of my favorite and
printed them off and cutted them out I
then got a clear phone case and I just
laid them all on backwards
so the colored side was showing through
the front of the phone case and I just
laid them all on and I absolutely loved
the turnout of this and then just
slotted my phone on and it looks amazing
the good thing about this is you don't
stick them down so you can easily remake
them and have it however you want and
the second case I'm going to show you is
Disney cases I just fell onto Google and
found out Disney Princess pictures where
they look like they're holding something
and I just printed them out laid them on
my phone so it looks like they're
holding the Apple these are really
popular cases but they're actually quite
expensive so this is such a better way
of doing it and it's so many expensive
as well so I would definitely recommend
doing this and these are literally my
favorite I hope you enjoyed this really
quick and easy DIY video sometime if you
would like me to do more DIY weak
hearted things and I hope you enjoyed
bye
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
