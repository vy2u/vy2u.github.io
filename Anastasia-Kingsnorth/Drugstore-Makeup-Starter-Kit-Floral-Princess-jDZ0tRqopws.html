I would do a drugstore makeup starter
kit so these videos almost so requested
on my channel I don't know why but
everybody seems to love these type of
videos from me I also really enjoy
watching them because it gives me some
ideas of new things I can get from the
drugstore and they're also really
affordable things so I'm gonna try it
well as to get everything in this video
is under 10 pounds so it's not too
expensive it's very affordable and yeah
let's just get straight into the video
Oh first of all I'm just gonna show you
something that maybe you could keep all
of your makeup in so this is Zoey Ella's
makeup bag so she has three of them she
has the blue eyed one the dark pink
guinea pig one which I also do have but
recently I got this one so it's just
like a pastor deep inky peachy color
with golden dots and it says just say
yes on it and then zoella and it's so
good quality and as you can see inside
I've filled it all with my some of my
favorite makeup products from the
drugstore to show you so yeah this is
only 8 pounds but at the moment it's
seven pounds in superdrug so it's really
affordable and I'm going to go in the
order of that you apply your makeup so
I'm gonna start with primer so the
primer from the drugstore that I would
recommend is the Maybelline the baby
skin instant pore eraser so this is the
blue one they also do have the cool rose
and the warm apricot but I kind of
thought I'd show this one because this
one is actually my favorite it really
does last eye makeup all day to be
honest I prefer this over the
Porefessional
and it's only 8 pounds so it's not too
expensive it's you could get definitely
getting on a budget and it lasted me
ages so what loads left in this and I've
had it for maybe 3 4 months it's just
amazing it lasts so long and I use it
every day for school and it definitely
does keep all of my makeup it keeps it
matte it just keeps it on my face and
yeah I love this so this is the primer
that I would recommend for concealer
this is going to be no shock to anybody
that this is the one that I'm gonna
recommend and this is the correction
lasting perfection concealer so I
actually can't do mine completely up
because it like exploded
if I do it completely up it will just go
everywhere so I'm just gonna leave it
like this and this is the best concealer
I've honestly ever tried there is not a
concealer that will ever top this for me
this is just the best one and it's
actually the cheapest so it's so weird
you don't actually have to go and spend
a lot of money to get the best makeup I
think the best makeup out here comes
from the drugstore I love it so this is
only four pounds 19 and it's from
collection and the only downside is you
can scratch the packaging off but I
don't think that's too big of a worry
because the product inside is absolutely
phenomenal so honestly this is the
concealer that I would recommend full
foundation something that I would
recommend and I love so much it's my
favorite foundation is the la vieille
the foundation True Match so it says
it's super blendable and it has SPF 17
which is amazing because you actually
always need SPF because the Sun can burn
you even if it's not hot outside so you
get tons in there it's a really big
bottle it just has a silver lid and you
just pump it out it has a pump which I
really like I just pump it onto the back
of my hand and blend it into my face
it's really blendable you don't need
much for it to cover like your whole
face which means it will last a lot
longer and this is definitely the
foundation that I love or like bronzing
and highlighting there's something that
I would recommend is the bourgeois
Parrish bronzing powder and highlighted
duo so this is the duo with the
highlighter and the bronzer in and I
love these they are so so pigmented I
don't know if it's going to show up that
doesn't show up on camera but they are
so pigmented I believe this is about 7
pounds to buy and for a duo that's
really good because obviously you get
both there's not a thing I could fault
about this it's last ages I actually
have they like the just the bronze or
one as well so I think I'm stocked up on
this but I just love the packaging and
in terms of chocolate so that is like
such a bonus so yeah I absolutely love
this and recommend this a lot for blush
something well I actually really like
blush it's one of my favorite things and
I love to have really pigmented blushes
but I also love that the really shimmery
sparkly blush is just a blur to put onto
your cheeks so the blushes that I would
recommend
Ally
sleek ones so this is just a singular I
do have the blush palette but this is
just a singular ones for 4 pound 50 so
come to the little mirror and then this
one is in rose gold as you can see I
dropped it and like the corner chipped
out but it doesn't matter because I
absolutely love this blush it's so
pigmented like look I don't if it's
gonna show up on my hand nothing camera
does but um it's so pigmented I have it
on today it just gives a nice little
shimmer to your cheeks and for 4:50 this
has lasted me ages this was one of the
first ever blushes that I got and I
actually still remember going into super
to buying this I absolutely love it
honestly I recommend this so much this
is probably my favorite blusher from the
drugstore the last face item is powder
so probably like a lot of you are
expecting for me to say the Rimmel stay
matte but actually I really like the
Rimmel clear complexion so this is just
a powder looks like this and it's blue
and it's very similar to the Rimmel stay
matte but it's clear it doesn't look
like it doesn't add a layer it does but
it's very clear and it really does hold
my makeup on all day this is only four
pounds so it's like really affordable
and I use it everyday for school and it
hasn't barely gone down I haven't hit
pan yet I think I'm close to but I
haven't yet and I just love this this is
the powder I would definitely recommend
to you now I'm going to move on to eyes
so from the drugstore there's not really
an eyeshadow primer that kind of like
attracts me to it like I don't think we
actually have a drugstore eyeshadow
primer other than elf eyeshadow primers
but I'm not going to include that in
this video so I decided to just do a
shadowed basis and these bases are the
NYX jumbo eye pencils so I have three I
have one in strawberry milk one in black
bean and one in milk milk was the first
one that I've got and that's why it's
probably like use the most but honestly
these are amazing the reason I included
these in this video is because you can
now buy NYX makeup in certain next
stores I actually got my black bean one
from a next door in Milton Keynes
shopping center they have at the next
stand and they sell these very often you
don't find milk in there but you always
do find the others so I just have three
and I really like these four eyeshadow
primers and bases and also to my
waterline really really good products
definitely can't fault them for
eyeshadow you're probably expecting me
to say again an anyway undress me
palette or sleek palette so palette I'm
going recommend to you is anyway but
it's not like one of the typical ones
this is the Elysium palette I really
can't pronounce it but this is what it
looks like it's a really really big dupe
for the Naked 3 palette but I really
love this so it comes the thing I like
about this the most is it comes with an
eyeliner and a highlighter as well
there's palette is six pounds but I much
prefer it over the others so it comes
with like some glittery colors some
matte colors there's six glittery colors
and format colors and there's just a bit
of everything in here really it's very
similar to the Naked 3 which I like
because it's a cheaper version and yeah
I just love this this is definitely my
favorite palette from the drugstore at
the moment for eyeliner I would normally
say the soap &amp;amp; Glory super cat but I've
actually found a new love for liquid
liner at the moment and this one is the
collection extreme 24-hour felt tip
liner so when I first got this I thought
it was very watery on my eyelids and I
really didn't like it but now I am going
to love it so it's just like a liquid
pen and literally you just glide it
across and it comes straight out no
patchiness no nothing just glide it
across and it's there it is amazing I
think this is about two pounds 50 which
is like amazing for an eyeliner and
honestly I definitely recommend this I
actually really love collection products
for mascara obviously there are tons of
mascaras that you can get from the
drugstore but my personal favorite was
given to me by Molly and swap box and
this is the bourgeois body in one second
mascara as soon as i got this and i saw
the wand i was like this is gonna be
amazing and then i've tried it so many
times and i just cannot get over it the
one looks like this and i just dropped
it on my bed
so that's gonna be interesting to clear
up after this video at home the one
looks like that and i just love it so
much
my mum has like the blackest black one
and which is like shiny black packaging
but i just loved this well I actually
cannot get over
I love it so much I think it's around 11
pounds it's just the most expensive
thing in the video but you can actually
get it on offer I think there was an
iPhone and Superdrug which is 2 for 10
so definitely pick this up if you find
it now I'm going to move on to lip
products it just personally some of my
favorites so the first thing is this cos
lip balm so EMS lip balms are amazing
you can find them on Amazon or Ebay very
inexpensively like for 5 pounds and they
just feel lip balms this I would put
somewhere I've got a lip color on and
it's just amazing
this one is strawberry sorbet which is
my favorite poppy
my friend probably got me into my
birthday thank you poppy um I just love
this so much
it's amazing and my other lip balm is
this one and these are the Baby Lips dr.
rescues and our lips one is in pink me
up so these are now available in the UK
which makes me very happy because dr.
rescues are personally some of my
favorite baby lips so as you can see
this is just a very long pink one and I
really really like it there's three
pounds fifties that have gone up 50 P
nevertheless I love them another lip
product I recommend this is like a matte
lip product and these are the collection
cream puffs so these are moisturizing
lip creams and this one thing cotton
candy number one and these are matte
products so they very much like this one
what looks like Kylie Jenner's famous
like lip color icon that ain't that but
it's like a very nudie color but this
one is actually my favorite I'm not got
it on today but it looks very similar I
really like this I really like how it's
matte because I don't own many matte lip
colors and yeah these are only $2.99 so
amazing the final things I would
recommend I am such big fans on like I
literally can't you can get over it I
love these things so much and these are
the revlon lacquer bombs maybe it's
because they look really pretty and i
love the packaging it might be that but
these are my two shiny ones so I have
demure and whimsical
doom your is can open it like a very
nudie passed Ally pinky color and then
whimsical is a dark purple and I wear
these so much these are just my favorite
books ever they are eight pounds but
they often have like a buy one get one
half price or 210 pounds
so honestly go and get yourself some of
these because I love them so for brushes
you're probably expecting me to say Real
Techniques but actually I've discovered
some new brushes that I really like at
the moment and these are some elf
brushes so recently a company called
shop mister contacted me asking me if I
wanted to remove some of their products
and on their website they had a bunch of
elf stuff so I was lucky enough to be
able to pick out a ton of stuff and I
picked up some of their brushes and a
load of other makeup items so all of
that will be shown in a haul coming very
soon but these are just the makeup
brushes that I chose I got I don't think
it says on it oh it does total face
brush powder brush lip defining brush
eye crease brush bronzing brush
foundation brush and the blending eye
brush these are all really good quality
brushes especially this foundation one
so soft and they're very inexpensive
I'll try and link them down below on
shop mixer definitely go to shop mister
because there's sixty P each ok there's
sixty P each on shot mister so I'm gonna
link that down below make sure you go
and check that oh that was everything in
my makeup bag issues now empty I hope
