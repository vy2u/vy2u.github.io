going to be a drugstore makeup starter
kit so I often get asked questions about
what is my favorite drugstore lip
product or what would I recommend from
the drugstore so I just thought why not
make a video and just put all of my
favorite drugstore items or the ones I
recommend in it because I can just help
you guys if you need any help so if you
want to see my drugstore makeup starter
kit then carry on watching this is also
a collab with the amazing aliyyil FTW
her videos are so good I'm gonna link
all of her social medias and her YouTube
video in the description box down below
so make sure you go and check that out
once you watch this we're gonna pick a
products from each thing so primer
foundation can see that as someone yeah
so the first thing I'm going to show you
is this and this is the maybelline baby
skin instant fatigue blur in cool rose
so this was the first baby skin that I
ever got and it is most probably my
favorite so it's just a primer and it's
a pastel pink color and it's so
moisturizing I just cannot get over how
moisturizing these are they you barely
need any and they give so much coverage
so there are eight pounds but if you
have really good skin you could use this
for a foundation and a concealer as well
so really really good for eight pounds
then half my favorite foundation which
is the Rimmel London stay matte so mine
is in 0/10 light porcelaine or porcelain
on a now you pronounce that but this was
six pounds so amazingly cheap for a
foundation or gonna smell it then just
shows how much of you like beauty guru I
am um but this is only six pounds and
it's one of the best foundations I've
ever tried the coverage is amazing I
obviously brought the lightest shade
which I didn't really want to do I
wanted to buy the one up from this
because this is really really light for
me but I've got the lid on the floor but
still it's a really good foundation and
I would definitely recommend this for
six pounds then you can see the odd
recommend which is going to be no
surprise to anybody would be the catch
and last imperfection so the reason this
is in every YouTube video what most
beauty gurus do is because it is a
really good concealer and the best ball
I've ever tried hands down for four
pounds 19 this is like a foundation and
I buy mine in fair one
did by medium to but that was just so
orange toned on me but this is so pinky
light-toned
so it's amazing for four pound nineteen
and I would recommend everybody to get
this the powder
I recommend this is going to be the
Rimmel stay matte so I've got through so
many of these powders because it's just
the best powder ever I do find it makes
me go cakey sometimes but overall it is
a really good long-lasting powder before
pound this and the collection concealer
is just they just work miracles together
then for my powder powder highlighter
bronzer and blush I chose the bourgeois
Paris board three bonds at a illuminator
and this is just the bronzing powder and
highlighter duo which Lily got me in a
swap box so this is the bronzer and this
is the highlighter and I'll just swatch
them I don't know how well you know you
can't even see on my wrists but they're
really really pigmented
and this I think he's about six pounds
but because you get up onto Anna
highlighter that is really good then for
my blush I would hands down at picking
anyway blushes I have no problem with
anyway I absolutely love anyway and this
blush is one of the best blushes if
there are only a pound and bubblegum
which is this one is all got it all over
my hand it's my absolute favorite blush
it's so pigmented I'll swatch it on my
hand for you and okay you can't even see
that but it is so so pigmented and it's
just a perfect color so for a pound I
definitely recommend that
moving on to eyes there are two
different eyeshadow things I would pick
so I would normally pick the anyway
palettes but I kind of wanted to go
different because a lot of people use
those so the first pallet which I would
recommend is the sleek so these are
double the price of the MUA palettes
they are eight pounds but can we just
look at how stunning the colors are this
color and this color are my favorite as
well as this one
and the pigmentation is just so good
like the people I know he's just crazy
and for eight pounds really really good
and I'm so glad that I got this
definitely going to be buying more of
these other palette I would recommend
are the wet and wild
trios so this one is the one that pretty
much everybody gets the
walking on eggshells trio and this come
to the brow bone a crease and an eyelid
color and the reason I love these is
because it comes of two different
choices of brushes one a padded brush
which personally I hate and then a
blending brush which I've never seen the
palette come week before especially one
from the drugstore and I got this from
Amazon it was about four pounds so
seriously cheap and I know you can't buy
it in England unless you order a famine
soon but I would definitely recommend
trying to get this because it also has a
little guide on how to do it on the back
so definitely one of my favorite
palettes for like a I'd base or primer
or waterline color I would definitely
recommend the NYX jumbo eye pencil so I
have it in milk and strawberry milk but
this one is just milk and it's just a
white pencil and it just looks like that
and it's just are you I use it to line
my waterline with because it makes your
eyes so much more awake but um yeah you
can get these from NYX next NYX same
thing I got mine off Amazon though and
there are about four or five pounds and
they sell them on eBay it's also really
easy to get hold of if you're in England
and if you live in America you can just
buy these from your local pharmacy or
drug store because NYX is really common
in America I don't even know what I'm
talking about anymore but yeah I
definitely recommend this then for white
eyeliner I recommend the soap &amp;amp; Glory
it's super cat so this is about six
pounds but I got this with the Christmas
set last year or the year before and it
was a 60 pound set and this eyeliner is
so pigmented that you literally just
need one line and it does it it doesn't
smudge it lasts all day
if you rope your eyes it doesn't come
off so definitely recommend this
eyeliner before mascara I would finally
recommend the L'Oreal mega volume at
miss manga so I was debating whether to
get this mascara and then my mom got it
for me and the wand is just out of this
world
I know that's a really big statement to
make but the length it gives your
eyelashes is just crazy but you just put
it on and it just like literally
instantly thickens them and lengthens
them so I actually love this mascara and
I think it retails at about 8 pounds
then have 5 different lip products to
show you so the first one is the end
a Lux London lipglosses and this one is
in kooky this is just a dark purple
color and I love these because they
drive matte and then they don't like
when you touch your lips they don't
nothing comes off of it so for three
pounds definitely recommend that as one
of like the dark colors for autumn and
winter time for lip balms I have two lip
balms the first one is the EOS in
coconut milk so I got this from Amazon
and it just smells so good
like I don't love it as much as I love
coconut strawberry sorbet but definitely
looks amazing and I love a little swirls
on it and I also know that the baby lips
doctor rescue these is in pink me up I
think yeah pink me up number 40 and it
doesn't come out with brightly pigmented
as that it's so medicated like you know
where they're medicated because one it
smells really medicated and two it makes
your lips tingle so I got this from
Amazon my mom got me at that it's from
Amazon so I'll try and link it down
below but finally recommend these two
products here so this one is the
collection cream puffs in cotton candy
so amber actually got me this to my
birthday because she knows how much I
wanted it and another reason I really
wanted this as well because they smell
so good and you can just smell them on
your lips so I absolutely love that and
these retail at two pounds ninety-nine
and finally I would recommend the Revlon
lacquer bombs so this one is in 105
demure and this is just stunning you
just twist it up like this and there's
loads of product in it and they smell so
peppermint tea so they really freshen up
your breath when you put them on the
lips and these retail at 8 pounds so
that was everything in my drugstore
makeup starter kit video I hope you have
enjoyed it
