going to be doing a drugstore vs.
high-end juke video I've never done a
video like this before talking about
high-end makeup but I thought I would do
one because I always do drugstore even
though I'm including drugstore but I
thought I would show you a high-end
versions of certain things it's also a
collab video with the amazing looking
for the mist I'm completely obsessed
with this channel I'm really close to
enter them and I just love him so much
so make sure you go check his video out
I'm pretty sure it's gonna be amazing so
I hope you enjoyed the video and let's
get started so I'm going to show you
high in versions of the product first
and then show you drugstore dupes so my
first product is this and this is the
benefit Porefessional primer this is a
very popular primer in the high-end
makeup variety and this is the one that
a lot of people choose and I can
definitely agree why it is just amazing
it's so good it is 25 pounds but
obviously it's benefit so you can't
really expect it to be too cheap but
benefit have created a really good
primer here it definitely does keep my
makeup on all day but I do find that
it's slightly kicks up my makeup after a
while unless I put quite a bit on so I
do need quite a bit of product to
actually make it work my drugstore
version of this is the maybelline baby
skin instant pore eraser comparing this
to the pore fessional the pore fessional
is a nude primer and this is see-through
because it's silicone base I think that
one is silicone based as well but this
one is like a transparent solution and
it's only 8 pounds so it is about 15
pounds cheaper which is obviously a lot
cheaper because you could buy like three
for the price of one pore fessional
and to be honest I do prefer this I
think it's a lot better primer it keeps
my makeup staying more like nice all day
it doesn't take up as much and overall I
just think this is a better one for
foundation I do have a couple of fine
foundations but I have more drugstore so
my first high end foundation is the Mac
Studio Fix fluid so mine is in NC 15
this is SPF 15 as well so that's really
good and it does normally come with a
pump but I took my pump off so I could
keep the lid on it cuz I don't want it
to dry out or anything
so this is about 21 22 pounds but with
the pump it's about 25 and this is a
very good foundation but max do tests on
animals I know a lot of brands test on
animals but it does slightly put me off
using it however I don't think it's a
too bad foundation it does cake up after
a while but maybe that's just my skin
I'm not too sure but I'm from what I do
kind of like it my drugstore version of
that is the l'oreal true match
foundation so this is got SPF 17 so
slightly higher and mine is in true
ivory and i think this is a better skin
match for me than the mac one because
it's a bit more lighter toned so this is
a really good foundation it's more
better coverage and to be honest I
prefer this over there my to do fix
fluid so for 15 pounds cheaper I think
you can get a better foundation for
powder I don't actually own any high-end
powders because I'm obsessed with this
drugstore one so this is the Rimmel stay
matte and this is the powder I will live
for forever so this is better than any
high-end powder because I've never tried
in it well blusher my high-end blusher
has definitely got to be the matte
blushes so this one is in dolly mix and
Lily got me this one in a swap box I've
actually used it so much now it doesn't
it like it on camera but I genuinely
have I've used so much of this and
they're about 18 pounds to buy I think
so quite expensive but you do get a lot
of product and obviously you can refill
it as well so I think it's actually a
really good price for this blush I
definitely recommend these and they do
some really gorgeous shades my drugstore
dupe of this has to be the NYX Rose
Garden blush they are both kind of dark
pink twith undertone shimmers and this
one has definitely got to be more
pigmented you do get more product in the
Mac one and as you see the meta con is
slightly more darker but I really do
prefer this one I think I know I've
preferred every drugstore item so far
but it's because I think the drugstore
do some really good dupes and I
definitely recommend this for 6-pound
for bronzer and highlighter
my high-end version would have to be the
naked flushed because this was one of
the first like high-end bronzer and
highlighters that I got and I think it's
really stunning the highlighter is my
favorite and obviously it come to the
blush as well so mine is in the original
so I think it's called the naked flushed
original I'm not too sure but this is
22:52 by and I think the pan is at
seriously deep with product so for 2250
I definitely prefer this I prefer it
over the sleek contour kit because this
is 650 but the pan isn't as deep and I
don't think it's as pigmented I think I
definitely prefer the naked flushed
because this bronzer I find it is a good
color match for me but I don't know I
think the highlight is quite whitish and
I prefer a kind of pinky tone shimmery
highlighter so I think I would
definitely prefer the naked flush moving
on to eye so I don't actually have any
high-end eyeshadow pencils but for this
one I'm just gonna show you the more
expensive eyeshadow pencils that I have
so these are the NYX jumbo eye pencils
so I have three of these I have
strawberry milk black bean and milk and
I have been obsessed with these for so
long they are very sturdy to put on your
eyes they are six pounds to buy and I
just think these were a lot better than
the collection work the kind of eye
pencils so the problem I have with these
are they the nibs that break off and
obviously you can't twist them off and
have to sharpen them so it's very very
annoying and the lid actually came off
this once it's all smushed so I
definitely do think I prefer the next
ones even though you could get two of
these for the price of one of these I
still prefer the next one for eyeshadow
palettes obviously I'm gonna have to
show my naked 3 because there are some
really good dupes of this so my naked 3
palette is just stunning it's my
favorite palette ever my favorite colors
are dust buzz and Factory it's so
pigmented come to the double-ended brush
obviously it's 36 pounds but this is
definitely my Holy Grail palette my dupe
for this is the anyway ice island
palette so the funny thing is that my
favorite three colors from The Naked 3
palette actually these three chosen like
shiny ones in this palette so in here
for 6 pounds you get 10 colors a cold
eyeliner and a cold highlighter but I
have to say I think I prefer the Naked 3
because I think they're much more
pigmented and I'd prefer the packaging
and I don't know I think I just
preferred they get three four they're
for mascara my high end mascara is
actually cheaper than my drugstore sky
because it's a mini and this is the
benefit roller lash I think in every
single video I've done recently I've
spoke about this and it's honestly
because it's amazing it's just the best
mascara I have on today it just
my lashes so much and I just cannot
believe how amazing this is honestly oh
my god is just the best mascara and this
is only four pounds from Elle magazine
June 4 this has to be the bourgeois
Volume one second mascara so the the
roller that actually came out after this
so I don't it's not really a dupe this
is just a good drugstore mascara but
there's not much I would say about this
compared to the roller lash because the
roller lash is cheaper and I think it's
a lot better finally for my lip products
I have a wider lipstick for my high-end
one
so these glide on so easy I actually
have this on today they're just going on
so easy and they're so soft and you get
so much product in it as well like for
25 pounds you get a lot of product and
obviously it's very expensive but the
packaging is very designer and beautiful
and it's such good quality my dupes for
these would have to be the Revlon
lacquer bombs I speak about these a lot
as well because they're my favorite I
have it in whimsical provocative and
demure and these are my favorite they're
very much similar to why our lipsticks
and they're a lot cheaper so I
definitely recommend these for brushes I
would definitely recommend the Real
Techniques so this is an all my Real
Techniques surprisingly I just grabbed a
handful but these are still pretty
expensive for drugstore brushes I have
to admit like I think the blusher brush
is about 10 pounds to buy so obviously
that's pretty expensive but I think
these are amazing I have nearly all of
them I think as you can probably see but
I would definitely collect the rest of
the collection of them because I have
called they're my homegirl blush forever
finally my high-end version of my
brushes are these Sigma brushes oh and I
just dropped one so recently Sigma sent
me some makeup and some brushes to try
out and these are the brushes that they
sent me and I'm in love with them so
they sent me the 3d HD kabuki brush the
e55 eye training brush and the easte 65
small angle brush so these two are pink
and this is a huge huge
kabuki brush which I don't actually own
so I'm really happy about that and I
think the quality on these is
outstanding I would definitely recommend
the Sigma brushes over Real Techniques
I'm gonna link them down below if you
want to go and check that out the link
is going to be there that's the end of
my drugstore versus high-end
make up video I hope you have enjoyed
this thumbs it up if you did and I'll
see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
