easy and affordable makeup so I recently
did a video on my channel where I did
half face drugstore half face high end

all of the teachers will be down below
in the description box just in case you
want to go read them again but i'm so
excited for this video literally the
giveaway and the video is just no worse
i really hope you enjoy it and let's get
into the video
starting off with primer I use at my
L'Oreal Lumi magique base so as my face
has been a little less oily recently I
know shocking I decided to use this as
it's quite moisturizing as you can see
it leaves a glow to your skin which is
really nice under your foundation and
concealer and no makeup just glides on
with this so I would definitely
recommend this and it's a really
affordable to moving on to foundation of
course I had to use my favorite the
L'Oreal True Match I recently got a new
shade and I think it's just called ivory
and I feel like this matches my skin
tone really well and you can see how
much coverage this gives it literally
gives my skin a whole other layer and
I'm literally obsessed with it it's
perfect for school because it doesn't
dry your skin out and it leaves quite a
juley finish which is nice because it
lasts all day without taking up on my
skin and my skin is quite bad so I'm
definitely laughs on yours
I literally have this foundation so much
and you need to go by if you don't have
it already
moving onto concealer I'm going back to
the classic today and I'm going to use
the collection last imperfection
I use this every day I have no faults of
it it's the perfect consistency and to
be fair I will not use another concealer
for school as the coverage this gives is
amazing it really brightens my under-eye
area for when I'm feeling super tire
because I've woken up early and there's
only four pounds 22 by so go and buy
your shade because it's absolutely
amazing and I don't know where I'd be
without it to set that all down I'm
using the Loreal infallible powder this
is my favorite drugstore powder as it
really does keep everything matte all
day as you can see I've hit pan badly on
this so I do need to purchase another
one but as you can see it just
immediately mattified my skin and that's
what you need when you're at school
doing PE and sweating in essence because
it's boiling hot life I then took my
maybelline brick bronzer and first of
all use the pink blusher shades as a
blusher obviously and I apply this to my
cheeks and then I took the highlighter
shade in the brick part and I just pop
this on my cheekbones this Letham of
such a gorgeous bronze glow and it gave
a lot of color back to my face which I
love
four eyes I like to keep it very very
natural so I just took the Maybelline
lash sensational this is in blackest
black I think it is and it's the
luscious oil blend so it's really like
oily but it's amazing that doesn't sound
nice but it's honestly so good it's so
blackening as well like you can see how
much black and my lashes look and I'm
much prefer when eyelashes are pure
black instead of a light brown I don't
know I just like that but this is so
good it's not clumpy it's really
volumizing and I love it finally for
lips this pie is obviously optional too
what color you want to use once I put
this on I was thinking it's a bit dark
for school but I went with it anyway
it's the berry Emma lipstick in 169 it's
a gorgeous gorgeous nude shade but I
would prefer it Maps so I would probably
put powder over it for school and that's
the finished makeup look in it if you
took me ten minutes it's really easy and
affordable and looks very very natural
which is perfect for school
so I really hope you enjoyed that video
if you did give it a huge thumbs up
remember to also thumbs it up for the
MacBook giveaway because it's a MacBook
