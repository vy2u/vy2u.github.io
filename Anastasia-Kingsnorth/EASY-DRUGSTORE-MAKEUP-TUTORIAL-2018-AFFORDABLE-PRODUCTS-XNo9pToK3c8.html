today's video I am here with this
complete drugstore halo slash cut crease
eye makeup tutorial that was a really
long-winded intro but today I am going
to be doing is this eye looks I've got
here
it's a cut crease with a halo eye and I
really really like it it's something
different that I've never done before
and I think it looks super super pretty
and the main part of it is it's all
drugstore the whole face I've got today
is easily accessible in the drugstore
they're all products that you can go
into boots or super drug and buy you
wouldn't have to order any of them which
i think is so good and I just love the
finished look if you do want to see how
I got this look keep on watching and uh
now I hope you enjoy and let's get
started to start off there's a four word
drugstore makeup tutorial I'm going to
be prepping in my skin so I've got the
Garnier a botanical balm soothing and
moisturizer here and I use this pretty
much on a daily basis it's really good
stuff and it works as a primer for me as
I don't actually have a drugstore primer
I had to bend them all because they went
off but one that I really really like it
they may bring a baby skin but this
works just as well it's like a
moisturizer and a primer in one for me
oh I makeup literally glides on my face
once I've put this on my skin just feels
extremely blurred and I just love the
feeling that it gives me now that my
skin is all primed I'm going to go in
with one of my favorite color correcting
products from the drugstore and this is
the collection lasting perfection color
correcting concealer now I have quite a
bit of redness still on my face I've
managed to clear up my spots but I do
get quite a bit of redness so this is
just a product that really does
counteract it out especially because I
am really pale and the foundation I have
is really pale so it kind of hard to
cover it all up I've also come in a
gigantic spot on my forehead that I've
just realized so please just ignore that
and then I'm just gonna take the bottom
of my Beauty Blender and just bounce
that into my skin just to give it an
even color for the foundation to go on
then the foundation can give better
coverage as you can see that's just
covered my redness pretty much instantly
and for four-pound it's so good I feel
like it's actually a dupe for the urban
decay
green concealer because I used to
that but then that's like 20 pounds to
replace but this one this is such a good
drugstore treat for it for foundation or
I'm going to be using at my favorite
foundation ever and I always say it's my
favorite but I haven't used it in a
makeup tutorial for the longest time and
this is the L'Oreal True Match I have
used this on a daily basis for easily
the past year and a half and I love it I
can mix it with other foundations or I
can use it on its own so today I'm going
to be using it on its own mine is in the
lightest shade I don't know what the
lightest shade is but this is what shade
it is as I am extremely pale
I love the foundation because it's
extremely moisturizing and it doesn't
oxidize on my face really really quickly
so it gives me time to kind of put it
all on my face and blend it and this
isn't really a way to put foundation on
but today it's working for me I always
read one about this in tutorials and
everybody's like we'll kind of use it in
a video then so that's exactly what I'm
doing just to show you how much I
genuinely love this foundation and to
blend it I'm gonna be using my Beauty
Blender this is actually a nude one it's
not just completely covered in
foundation it's just such a beautiful
color and as soon as you start to blend
it it soaks into your skin it retails
for $9.99 which her drugstore foundation
all of this quality I wouldn't say the
coverage is extremely high like a
website it's the highest coverage you
can get but I'd say it's medium to high
which is pretty good for ten pounds as
you can notice it's not oxidizing and
it's just staying liquidy on my face
allowing me to take my time to blend it
which is so good because then I can make
sure it's not streaky that's actually
took about a minute of blending and it's
already all soaked in and blended to my
skin but my skin doesn't feel dry and it
still feels moisturizing and I could
just carry on bouncing this and it
wouldn't change the consistency of the
foundation which I love now I'm gonna go
with some concealer just to give me that
a little bit extra coverage because we
love coverage here on this channel I'm
going to be using my ultimate favorite
concealer this is the collection last
imperfection and I speak about this all
the time but again never really use in
videos everybody's like what's your
favorite and I always say this but I
never demonstrate it so so I'm doing
today again this concealer is only four
pounds nineteen and I feel like this is
just become an absolute drugstore
classic there's a few other concealers
that I love which is the maven
instant anti age rewind concealer that's
really good and that's eight pounds I
also really like the Maybelline fit me
and the L'Oreal True Match concealer is
really really good as well but this
concealer I use mine in the shade fair
one and it's just the perfect shade for
me is it blend in with my foundation so
so nicely and doesn't leave me with any
like strange marks or anything that's my
base makeup done as you can see I am
extremely pale but you know what will
contour it will bring the color back to
my face with my eyes so now I'm going to
move on to brows and again I've used
this in so many videos this is the
freedom be free to makeup professional
London brow pomade this is an amazing
dupe for that AM saves you Beverly Hills
one I love this so much if you look at
my recent Instagram photos and loads of
people have been like well your brows it
really good I'm like thank you it's this
this is so good and I got it on sale for
two pounds fifty but then somebody
commented on my video saying oh did you
know that it's actually getting
discontinued and that's kind of scared
me a bit because I don't want it to I
always skip this part in my videos just
because it takes me so long to do my
brows but I start halfway across my brow
and just drag it down to start to create
that shape and start to create an arch
as I have quite a lot of hair it's hard
to get a shape I just kind of drag it
down and just just kind of guess it I do
have to carve them out with concealer
because I always make them too thick
just like you can see I have today but
then I can just at the front drag it
across really lightly and then just drag
my brush up like this don't do it too
much at the front and then gradually get
harder as you go further on I'm gonna go
away I'm gonna fill in on my other
eyebrow and fix this eyebrow because
it's way too long and then I will be
back brows are all and are feeling
remotely human again and they actually
look pretty good today sometimes you
have like the brow days and I always say
in every video this brow is ten times
better than this one but today I'm
liking them so for powder because I do
have oily skin and I do have to set my
face alright I'm going to be using my
classic Rimmel stay matte powder I've
been using this pages as you can see
because I have hit pan and then I just
taken my massive GWA brush and I
literally buff it all over my face
for contour we're gonna go in with one
of my favorite palettes from the
drugstore this is the makeup revolution
contour trio I think this is amazing
I love it so much I use my morphe full
brush and I just use this shade here it
is quite dark and this is the lightest
palette so I do have to be very very
careful when contouring so it doesn't
look too dark but it gives me such a
nice color and it's so easy to work with
it's so easy to blend but as you can see
it just blends so nicely into my skin
and I think it just looks so pretty into
such a natural flush of color as you can
see that just looks so so pretty and as
per usual we're gonna bring it up on my
water I just do we're gonna bring it up
on my forehead this is the only problem
with this brush as it is quite big that
is really easy to do but fingers crossed
we can rectify it
just gonna keep blending it in oh gosh
no you have to do the smaller brush I'm
also just gonna add a little bit down
here as well this does give me a bit of
a foundation line but you know what
that's what we like to represent here on
this channel that I can never find a
foundation too much my actual face I'm
liking it and you know what actually
we're gonna add some blush and then
we'll move on to eyes so I'm going to be
using my sleek rose gold blush again
speak about this all the time I can't
open it I speak about this all the time
but I never use in videos so that's what
I'm gonna do I'm gonna take my Real
Techniques blush brush just pop this in
and I've said many times but this is a
dupe for the NARS orgasm and actually it
might be a bit more pigmented I really
like that I feel like I've put quite a
bit on so I'm gonna go with my powder
brush but you know what it will faith
throughout the day give me a natural
glow now I've got the majority of my
face makeup on I'm gonna leave highlight
and leave lips and now I'm gonna move on
it to eyes and now I'm feeling it today
to do a bit of a cut crease and a halo
eye I've never tried mixing both of them
together and I've never actually tried a
halo eye before so this is going to be a
first try for me but I'm going to be
using it the soft as nails revolution
palette because this is my favorite
dress or palette I think it's so good
the range of colors in here are amazing
and I'm gonna try and do it kind of a
burn orange brown with a bit of red
undertone so fingers crossed this is
gonna work
I've got my palette here and first of
all we are gonna go in with this kind of
orange shade here and a mixture of this
shade and we're just gonna blend them
both together and I'm literally just
gonna pack this on my eye doesn't really
matter
if it goes all over I'm just gonna drag
that all across it's got this light
shimmer to it which is so so pretty
we're just gonna drag that all across
especially in the inner corner as we're
gonna really focus on making the inner
corner really defined in this video also
it's gonna really drag it out but again
I would cut it off with concealer so
let's just ignore this part of the eye
now like I said I'm also gonna bring it
down onto my lid which is something I've
never really done before we've done it
one eye and now we're gonna go in it
with the other again it just completely
pack it on blend it all out and see how
Orange we can actually make it now I
need to take another brush I'm gonna
take a bit more of a smaller real
techniques brush and we're gonna take a
bit more of a brown shades I think we
should go in with all no should we do
red actually we're going to do this at
ready burgundy shade and this is the
shade that we're going to cut the crease
with so I need to get this shade just
above my crease just so you'll still be
able to see it when I actually cut it
but it's such a nice color though it's
like a burnt salmony color feeling it
this kind of looks like a sunset on my
eye I'm really kind of feeling it so I'm
just gonna keep the blending this in and
make sure there's no harsh edges now
we're gonna move on to the other eye
again just focus this in the crease I
wish I actually had a smaller brush to
do this with but this is a smaller eye
shadow brush I have so it definitely I'm
gonna have to invest in some smaller
brushes so I can create more defined
looks now we've just basically got two
splurges of ISO on my eye what I need to
do is cut the crease so I have just this
little hack thing that I tend to do just
to cut my crease because I don't really
have the right shape I used to do it
normally so I take my collection
concealer make sure there's a fair bit
of concealer on here and then I'll just
pop it on my lid and just blink upwards
and then it can create the kind of line
where the cut crease needs to be and
then I can just go ahead link again fill
it in we can go all the way around in
order to create the perfect cut crease
shape as you can see it's looking very
very messy and then we're just going to
color all of that in with this brush
I'm gonna repeat that on the other eye
and then we can darken up the inner in
the outer corner now I finished cutting
the crease I'm gonna take the same red
shade and I'm gonna bring this ever so
slightly intimate outer corner and into
my inner corner and this will allow me
to create the halo eye and then I'm
gonna dark it up with some Brown as well
if you do want this to be super super
smoky so I'm gonna start with my outer
corner and even though it's gonna get
rid of the cut crease this will allow me
to create a bit more of a smoky eye and
will just create a bit more dimension I
really as it's not really that much
going on
I'm leaving quite a big gap in the
middle for the glitter as of course we
are gonna add the glitter in this it's
the bottom third color and I'm going to
start building that up on top of the
purpley color to make it a bit more dark
and again I'm just gonna do the exact
same in the ear corner as you can see
that actually looks really really good
and now I need to take a tiny brush and
a blend this Brown across the top of my
eye which is gonna be super super that's
what this eye looks like and again I'm
just going to do the exact same on the
other eye so we're gonna start with the
burgundy in the outer corner we're gonna
blend it all together and then we're
gonna darken it up again with the brown
in the outer corner on the inner corner
just so it looks symmetrical I cleaned
the oiler Cup and I'm literally obsessed
with how this looks like I think it
looks so good and it's so effective
having the dark color in the inner
corner now I'm just gonna take a flat
brush this should just one from Real
Techniques and I'm just going to take
the white shade from the palette and
just pop this on the inner part of my
eye although now I'm seeing it and like
how I'm really really liking I don't
know whether to add actual glitter or
just to add a pigmented eye shadow
because the white I thought is actually
really made and effect and I don't know
if the collectors gonna kind of ruin it
I think I'm just gonna add a little bit
of glitter so not too much at all and
I'm going to use one out of this palette
I was actually gonna use this like I
said I feel like it might go a bit too
far so I'm just gonna take a gold
glitter from this palette I'm gonna take
this one here really really lightly on
this brush and just kind of pack it in
the middle of my eye I'm just adding
that really really lightly in layers
building up not going as high as the cut
crease
still want the white to be there and
then finally just to finish the eye look
off I'm gonna be taking the white and
I'm gonna be adding this on top just to
really carve out the cut crease and to
make sure that you can still really see
it and then just brushing all of that
over with a big brush just to get rid of
any excess I also do need to carve round
here with some concealer just to make it
really really sharp and just so it
doesn't look too blended out now I've
done that I'm actually gonna add some
lashes and these are gonna be lashes
I've never used before and these are
from GWA girls with attitude but you
guys know that I do use their lashes all
the time I've just never use this pair
before and these are the mythical 3d
luxe lash does it say which ones they
are is that literally what they are
mythical I guess it's mythical that is
my eye makeup done I think it looks so
good this is so kind of like different
of what I usually do like the halo eye
and the cut crease I'm really really
liking it and I think you laughing is
quite good for a first attempt now we
need to highlight my face to bring back
some even more color I'm going to be
using the south exit revolution
highlight palette as this is one of my
favorite drugstore highlighters if not
my actual favorite we're gonna pop this
first of all on my cheekbones using my
little tart brush and as you can see the
difference that this makes already I'm
using a mixture of the top four shades
and the lilac shade for this again just
gonna repeat that bond at the other side
and literally got one stroke and you're
glowing
it's insane gonna blend this all the way
up and then I'm gonna take the yellow
shade highlight my Cupid's bow and then
again take the right shade and highlight
the end of my nose and if you know it's
highlight is exactly what brings the
makeup look together I'm gonna take the
lightest white shade really tightly in
there just to give it a little bit of
glow that it needed now I am going to
move on it to lips where have I put my
lip color I am gonna be using it the NYX
liquid suede lipstick in the shade so
spoken and I haven't actually used this
before but it looks like a really pretty
color I've used the liquid phase before
just not this shade so that has just
glided onto my lips
and now that my lipstick is on that is
my finished makeup look overall I do
really like it it's something quite
different for me it's quite dark and I
thought like I need to do a brighter eye
look but I'm just feeling the dark
colors and I love to halo of it oh god I
literally love this so that is the end
of this video I really hope you guys
have enjoyed if you did it remember to
smash a massive thumbs up let me know
what other makeup tutorials you want to
see down below like I said this was
completely drugstore which is insane
considering the total price of this is
definitely less than 100 pounds but
thank you so much for watching like I
said if you did enjoy miss Patrick huge
thumbs up and I love you all so much
after her mouth I love you all so much
I'll see you on Sunday at 10 a.m. for a
