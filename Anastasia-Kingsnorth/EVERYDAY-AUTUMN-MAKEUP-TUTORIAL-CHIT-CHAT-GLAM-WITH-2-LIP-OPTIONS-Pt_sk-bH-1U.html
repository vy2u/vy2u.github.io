going to be doing this chit chat
ultimate get ready with me for this
makeup look I have decided to do a tour
- makeup tutorial today because I love
autumn makeup so much it's about my
favorite makeup to film and I thought
you guys would really like a tutorial on
it so I did a tutorial with two
different lips one it kind of a red
matte lip and then one nude liquid
lipstick and I loved it so much I never
really wear Reds like this so normally
wear like purple toned red so this is a
little bit of it ever look for me I
really hope you guys enjoy the video and
let's just get started the first broke
I'm going to start off with is at my
Urban Decay Naked skin concealer and
this is a color correcting concealer in
a green shade because as you can see my
skin isn't actually all one color it's
actually quite red so you can see how
much I've used of this and I just pop
this on my areas where it's a little bit
red and it can show through the
foundation sometimes and this just
counteracts all of it out and just makes
it look a lot more smooth and then I'm
gonna use my Real Techniques sponge just
to blend this all in it does leave like
a bit of a green layer on top of your
skin but as long as you use a high
coverage foundation then that really
should have matter you don't have to
blend it in completely like I said
either because it is used to cover the
redness so what do you think it's
covered you can kinda just stop blending
and as you can see it's left a bit of a
green layer but that's absolutely fine
and then I am gonna go in with my
foundation today I really mixing two
foundations together I'm gonna be using
my Mac Pro Longwear which I am loving at
the moment and the brand new body shop
Matt clay a skin clarifying a foundation
now together I like them on their own
they are good but I prefer to mix
foundations as as you can see this is a
little bit too orange and this is a bit
too light so when I mix them together
they give me the perfect shade so I just
like to mix them on my hand so I just
get one and a little bit of a pump of
the Mac one and then I just add quite a
bit of this one because then that one's
quite thick and don't get me wrong I
like thick foundation but then I have to
be able to blend it it has to be very
jewy looking on my skin so that's why
I'm going to use a bit of the bodyshop 1
mixed in and then I just mix it in
together on the back of my hand being
careful
into my hands because I don't want to
lose any product and then just pop it
all over my face I also forgot to
mention I have already filled in on my
eyebrows i use the anastasia beverly
hills dipbrow to fill them in i actually
used to use the Ardell brow pomade and
that's so good and then it ran out and
then I just never ended up buying a new
one so in the meantime while I couldn't
get to the shop and buy a new one I used
the odd as his Beverly Hills one and I
actually really like it it's not my
favorite thing in the world that was so
close but it does the job and still I
can get the Adele one cuz that I don't
want isn't stocked in my town so I have
to go like to the next town over to go
and get it but yeah I mean it's really
good I can't get the fade as well as I
used to be able to but I still like it
and then I just take my Real Techniques
sponge again and I'm just gonna blend
this all over my face this does give
quite good coverage not like amazing
coverage and not the best but it's okay
my favorite foundation is actually the
l'oreal true match foundation but
because i use that in all makeup
tutorials i wanted to try something
different and kind of get a bit of a
first impression cuz i've actually going
to use its body shop foundation like one
or two times so i normally mix the mac
one would the body shop one but i don't
know it's okay but this isn't my
favorite combination in the world
I normally do my eyebrows after I've
done my foundation so this is actually
quite hard to go around them because I
normally do my foundation concealer set
it with powder then while the powder
setting fill in my eyebrows with my
eyebrows take me a while and I can never
get them right on camera
that's why I've done them before now
once all your foundation it looks
blended it's a little bit streaky so I'm
gonna have to blend that one I've got my
concealer on now I'm gonna go in with
concealer so this is actually the Mac
Pro Longwear concealer and I've never
used this so this is gonna be a bit of a
first impression if it goes wrong so
I've heard quite a few things that this
pumped quite a lot out in one pump so
I'm gonna be very very careful right so
this is my first time using it that's
uncommon to pump it quite a few times I
can feel it coming up now that barely
gave me anything maybe they've changed
it you pump it again okay if you're very
very careful then you won't get too much
but that was nowhere near as much as I
thought was going to come out from what
I see on like online and stuff when
people let it out because they say
that's the thing they can see this
really good but it just gives out too
much okay good try this this is also a
little bit too dark for me so I might
have to go in with a bit of a lighter
foundation as well but that's good to go
I actually quite like that that's not
too bad
it's not exactly brightening because as
I said it's the wrong shade for me well
it's not the wrong shade it's just not
as light as I usually go this is like it
was actually the right shade but I
prefer it to be a bit lighter just so
you can tell the difference but actually
this is really nice I really like this
so hqe it's very easy to blend it's
quite smooth looking and it doesn't look
as though it's leaving like any streaks
or anything so this might be a win-win
situation with this concealer yeah you
know what guys I really like that
concealer I think we're gonna start
using that on an everyday basis because
I thought the color map just gonna be
worse and actually yes that's actually
quite a good match then to set all of my
foundation in place I'm gonna go in and
with my Laura Mercier translucent
setting powder this stuff is incredible
end off I love it so so much
I'm just going to take this on my same
sponge as well as I'm going to be
starting a new sponge after this video
for the recently
beauty blenders so I just popped this
powder under my eyes on my nose around
the edges of my nose as eye makeup tends
to crease a lot there on my chin and
then a little bit on my forehead because
I don't really need to set my makeup
that much on my cheeks and stuff so
don't really get oily there it's just a
lot in my t-zone I get them very very
oily in it so now all of that is setting
I'm gonna move on to my eyes because I
feel like if this needs to set for a
long time so actually looks really
smooth and stuff so let's do my makeup
for my eyes I'm going to be using two
different palettes so I'm going to be
using the violet faust Pro palette and
then the Urban Decay Naked heat palette
I'm definitely use the violet box I
don't know about the only heat one but
I've got it with me just in case and
then I'm going to be using in my Real
Techniques
eyeshadow brushes so I've got the angle
brush the base shadow brush and then the
Bayeux another base shadow brush these
the same knee the same okay so I'm gonna
start off with the angled brush and I'm
just gonna blend a color through my
crease
I would prime my eyelids but they've
been primed with concealer and
foundation and I know you're not
actually meant to put concealer or
foundation on your eyelids but I've
realized I've done it anyway so I'm
gonna have to just kind of like go over
that so with the violet bas palette I
think I'm gonna take the shade besty
which is this one just here and I'm just
gonna blend it through my crease just as
a transition shade and a base start off
with violet Voss eyeshadows I extremely
extremely pigmented and you really do
not need to put your brush in the pan
more than three or four times to get a
lot of color out like this is such a
nude shade and I've already got loads on
my eyelid so I don't even want the show
to show up that much I really liked all
mother to do red or orange I think I'm
gonna do orange because I always do red
kind of like an orangey gold look today
once I've blended that up as high as I
want it and it's super soft then you can
do the other eye who say Betty is so
beautiful because it's not exactly like
a red toned Brown it's more of an orange
toned Brown which is exactly what I
wanted they've got some ready tone
Browns in here but I feel like they
don't actually look Brown they look red
when I put them on my eye
but these Browns are super super nice
and super subtle like even if you just
wanted to put this Brown in your crease
put your mascara on it would just add a
nice bit of definition which you didn't
already have so I've got that shade on
my eyelid and that looks really nice it
just it's very soft and then I need to
darken my crease up so think I'm gonna
go in it with a little bit of a darker
shade and this is are you kidding me
just looks like this it's a bit of the
same brown but it's actually like a
darker form of that Brown if that makes
any sense it's actually quite a lot
darker so I'm just gonna blend that out
a third of my eye I don't know if I'm
gonna like sharpened the edge of my eye
today today or leave it soft I'm still
very undecided and that just looks super
super pretty and blended and then do the
exact same on the other eye
I thought I'd zoom in the camera so you
can see a little bit more of what I'm
doing and now I'm gonna go in it with
the shade hashtag and this is just a
really bright cerise orange and I'm
gonna try and put this on top of the
brown the brown would have a lot more
pigmented than I thought and actually
spread a lot more so I don't know how it
did this orange we're gonna need but
let's try it so it's actually quite
pigmented when you pop it on top and I
don't really want to like drag this dot
that far cuz I think I might put it in
right in a corner so I just want to kind
of put this on the outer V and lightly
blend this and then I can darken it up
with a sheet of brown this is a super
super nice orange it's not as vibrant as
it would be if there wasn't a brown
underneath it but considering I'm piling
this on top of each other it's still
very very pigmented once those shades
are on and they're all blended to how
you would like I'm then gonna darken it
up in the outer corner and I think I'm
gonna go in it would be shade it's heavy
bear now this is if you can see it a
very very very strong pigmented brown so
I read it out this is gonna go this is
just a little bit more definition to my
eye just to make sure it doesn't look so
orange II and that is actually a really
nice shade
now on the base of my lids I'd currently
have nothing so I kind of want to make
it quite shimmery there's a really
beautiful shade in this palette called
toffee but I think I'm gonna start off
with the shades
awesomesauce which is just this gold one
here and it looks a lot more orange on
camera but it's quite golden and I'm
just gonna blend this starting from the
outer third or into the inner third and
I hope you gonna make it like - as it
goes across and then we'll add on the
top the shade toffee Wow okay that's a
really nice shade and then we'll just up
put on my other eye as well but I don't
want it to be so white I want it to be
very like or to me a very dark and then
I'm just gonna add the shade toffee
right in the outer third just to make it
a little bit more chunkier and golden as
to me it's not quite shimmery enough yet
and as you can see this coffee shade
just as - that you're looking for that
is basically the eye look I'm gonna go
for today it's just quite not really
subtle but very Ottoman you can see the
colors that are blended which I really
like most of the powder I've actually
set it in my makeup at this point but I
just like to do this just to make sure
it's all blended in it's a very soft and
very fluttery and nice I'm then going to
go in with my benefits hoola bronzer
this is one of the best bronzers I swear
by this I love it so much in my last
makeup tutorial I used my Anastasia
Beverly Hills contour kit and it's
really good I use it every day but I
don't want to keep using the same stuff
for you guys I want to use a mixture of
products so I'm going to use this today
and this is so good
as you can see which is quite a subtle
contour but it just adds a lot of color
back to my face as I am quite pale as
you guys can probably tell
I'm now going to go in with a blush and
this is the Mac flush in a desert rose
saffron now she told me to get this she
was like Anna it's incredible you're
going to love it so I've got it and
don't get me wrong it's incredible then
I'm gonna go in with something new which
I've only swatched I haven't actually
properly tried it yet and this is the
revolution X sofas nails palette so if
he has done incredible with these
palettes and I love it so much so I'm
going to use a mixture of the top shades
today as I love a kind of like light
whitie glow and i've swatched them and
these are incredible so oh my god that's
so pretty it's not like a blinding glow
it's very subtle but it's very very
pretty
oh my god I love that that's incredible
someone's gonna pop that on my Cupid's
bow as well as a little of a highlight
to keep his bow and of course I have to
pop it on the end of my nose by the way
this golden shade here this one here is
at my favorite shade that's super super
pigmented and I love icy white highlight
as well so and then I just saw every
with my body shot fan brush and just
make sure all of that is blended in and
it doesn't look too cakey and you guys
know what I mean now I've done on my
base I'm gonna go back in with some
eyeliner now I've written at the how
this is gonna go but I'm gonna use the
Maybelline master precise eyeliner I
really want to get the Kat Von D tattoo
liner so if you think that's good please
let me know down below because I'm
currently living on this and it is on
the verge of running out
this Armand is really good the only
thing is it finds it kind of hard stay
is black and travel over the eyeshadow
which is really annoying
that's my eyeliner done I need to clean
up all of that eye shadow underneath and
then it will be perfect I just need to
kind of sharpen it off so I'm just going
to do the other eye and then I will show
you guys on my lashes now all my
eyeliner is done and I've cleaned up all
of the excess eyeshadow I'm gonna blend
a little bit I should underneath so I
think I'm gonna go in with the orange
shade just so it's very pigmented it's
very a little bit of vibrant because my
eyes are looking pretty dark I don't
want them to be that that dark I want
them to be quite or to me this is one of
the hardest parts I find to do like
blending I said it's new but Neath my
eye it never seems to blend like it does
to everybody else on YouTube and then
I'm also going to try and take a little
bit of that toffee shade and blend that
in my inner corner underneath my eye
because I want it to be quite glittery
quite vibrant that I've blended it's so
nicely I think it's like you're just
finding a really pigmented shade I'm
then going to go in it with some lashes
I'm gonna use my red cherry lashes in
Birmingham and I really like these
they're quite likely quite flattery so
I'm just gonna pop these on with my pink
duo lash adhesive and then blend them
with some mascara now I don't know if
you guys can see but I actually have
these lashes on and they're super super
lightweight that you can't really see
them and I'm the type of person that
really likes like big bold eye lashes
I'm gonna have to add a lot of mascara
this is the L'Oreal mega volume miss
baby roll mascara so when you do this I
first because I've got the eye lashes on
this I first just so these have a little
bit longer to dry and I'm just going to
pop it and blend them all together just
so it adds a little bit more definition
I wasn't very black
now my eyes are done I can move on to
lipstick so you can either go for a nude
lip or you can go for a red lip I think
I'm gonna start off with a nude lip then
I try it with a red lip possibly so this
is the Too Faced melted latex liquid
lipstick and I've never actually used
this before so I'm very excited to try
this I don't usually wear liquid
I always their matte so this is going to
be very interesting and let's see how it
applies actually feels like so tight I
love the shade as you can see the color
is quite light compared to my eyes but I
really like it it's not very tall to me
but it's a really pretty shade just need
to do my top lip and then we can see the
overall look
that is the finish lip it's a very nude
lip and it's quite pinky compared to the
ice so I do like it
this is much more of a daytime lip I
feel and then also going to try this
matte lipstick shade in deeper just to
see whether the eyelid looks better with
a nude lip or a matte dark lip I forgot
it was called I love this color so much
so that is the end of this video I
