going to be doing this full glam makeup
look that I feel like is perfect for
Valentine's Day but I'm single AF so I'm
not gonna be doing anything on
Valentine's Day so I've just done this
look for myself and I really like it I
haven't ever done a look like this
before with kind of pinks and purples
and especially this color glitter but I
really really like it I think it's
something very different for me and I
used a really big range of makeup
products I used products that I love
products that I hate products that I
haven't used in a long time or proce
that I haven't even used at all so it
was a first impression so basically just
a mixture of things to create this look
but I really hope you guys enjoy if you
do remember to give it a huge thumbs up
and let's just get started I am going to
beat this face because I have no makeup
on right now come on a few breakout
we're sorry I just don't really that
weird I use the face mask last night and
it really did not suit my skin I'm gonna
be using a mixture or makeup product
today that I really like that I haven't
used in a while oh my gosh the primers
come out hard I haven't used it in that
long over time basically today I'm going
to be using a mixture of makeup products
that I you that love I haven't used
haven't used in a long time or I want to
give it a second try so the first thing
we need to be going in with it's the Too
Faced hangover
primer now I remember quite liking this
and I think I did because the majority
the bottle is gone I didn't buy this
they actually sent this to me through PR
so I think it's quite good I mean
obviously you have to kind of wear the
makeup for a lengthy amount of time to
be able to tell how good it is but it
feels very moisturizing and I have very
oily skin so it feels quite nice on my
skin right now that to me it was quite
replenishing is that the word I think
that's the word it's got a bit of a
weird smell to it I feel that because I
haven't used it in a while but not too
bad we are going to go in it with a
product that I've never tried before but
I'm really excited and this is the
collection lasting perfection green
concealer so as you can see I have a
fair few red patches and green concealer
is a
amazing for redness that's basically
what you use it for you to pop it on all
the areas you have redness then just
blend it in and it's not too kind of not
exactly fully cancel them out but make
them a little bit less noticeable I've
heard quite a lot about this concealer
and again it was sent to me through PR
I've had it in my drawer for a while so
I just thought I'd give it a try I mean
I guess what again notice a bigger
difference where I've actually got like
my face makeup on and we'll be able to
see if you can see the redness through
it but even just now I feel like it's
canceled out quite well for foundation
I'm gonna go in with a foundation that
is fairly new that I haven't really used
that much yet but I've seen many reviews
about it on YouTube and this is the
fenty Beauty foundation now obviously
this was completely raved about because
of the massive shade range I've got mine
in the shade I'm actually not really
sure what shade it is it's 170 and I've
only used this maybe two or three times
but it was again like quite a few weeks
ago so I'm not really not sure like if I
like it or not so I'm just gonna put
this all over my face and I thought we'd
give it another try today just because I
feel like on one of the only people on
YouTube to have not reviewed this
foundation and I want to give you guys
my honest opinion on it as I'm filming
this the kind of whole hype about the
Tarte shape tape foundation is going on
about how the shade range isn't big
enough because there's not many darker
shades and I just read touch response
and I was quite shocked actually because
I really liked art stuff I've ordered
I literally just placed an order on
their website but the shade range I'm
not happy with at all I feel like this
is actually gonna be a little bit too
dark for me and I haven't put enough on
because I don't know how full coverage
this is this isn't as full coverage as I
thought it was going to be it's quite
yellow toned and I prefer personally for
me quite pink tones because I just feel
like I'm trying to blend this down my
neck as well I'm really sorry I don't
know how I'm feeling about this year
maybe I need to add a bit more product
so I can give it a fair review but let
me just have a bit more than I can tell
you guys I've added a little bit more
but I'm still kind of like struggling to
spread it because it's oxidizing really
quickly on my skin it's not like a
horrendously bad coverage at all it's
actually quite
good coverage I do quite like it
actually but I don't think I'd choose it
on an everyday basis I are actually
gonna add a little bit of my trusty
laurio True Match just to help it blend
out with it easier oh it's dripping down
my finger and it's a little bit more my
shade because as you guys can see I'm
extremely pale overall I think it's
actually not a bad foundation but just
for my skin I need to mix it with a
product that's thinner because it's
quite quite thick that's the base I
don't think it's bad at all I just don't
think it's my favorite so now I'm gonna
go in with a concealer that I haven't
used in a while again and this is the
Mac Pro Longwear concealer now everybody
says quite a lot comes out on one pump
so it wasn't too bad but then again I
was quite you know careful with it but
that's the only thing people say about
this Mac Pro Longwear concealer too much
comes out but I love the smell of this
my Beauty Blender into the garage please
ignore it I'm chalking out after this
video of all you said that to myself
this is a really good concealer like I
definitely read it's really really nice
blend really nice on my skin too I do
use it a bit as an eye primer as well
that's why I'm putting on my eyelids but
I know you know when to put foundation
or concealer on your eyelids but I'm
very careful when I blend it around
those areas because the skin is thinner
overall I think that's a really really
nice concealer and I would recommend
that that's blended really really nicely
on top of the foundation I'd give that a
10 out of 10 I really like that now
we're gonna go in with one of my
absolute Holy Grail products and this is
the Rimmel stay matte powder so I just
take this on a Mac 100 brush think this
is actually a contour brush but I think
it works really well for powder on my
face and the Rimmel stay matte is just
an absolute holy ground it's been around
for years and I can feel like it's had
its time where everybody was raving
about it on YouTube just like when the
collection last infection you can see
the first came out but this powder is
literally insane like I love it so much
it's the only
matte pressed powder that I own that I
really like - the only one I own full
staff now we need to add a bit of color
back to my face because we've all just
very matte right now so I am going to
use the makeup geek bronzer in the shade
tawny and this is the medium skin at
bronzer I remember really
liking this what I did a first
impressions video on it back maybe like
two or three months ago so I thought I'd
give it a like I thought I'd give it
another try
although I'm not really it's very very
like oh I think I'm using the wrong
brush for this I'm gonna go in with a
nancy brush I'm trying like that could
that gives me more control over how much
products I'm putting on my face and
that's actually a really nice today you
know I like that a lot
yeah I do remember really liking this to
be honest it's really really nice this
brush has give me a lot more control
over where the product is going on my
face not a few brushes are really good I
feel like they're not as raved about as
they should be but I felt like that's a
really good shade for my skin tone is
like it's not too much bronze back up
the forehead because the forehead is
lacking in some color and then I walk
carve out my jaw bone as well just a
little bit cuz I don't really have one
to be honest I feel like when I put it
down here I'm just creating myself an
even bigger foundation line but you a
needed once overall I really like that
run so I think that's added just a
really nice pop of color back to my face
I think that's really really pretty for
blush I'm going to go in with the Mac
blush in a desert rose I really really
like this blush saffron Tommy's dry
there she said it's a really pretty
color and I really really like it it's
perfectly matte like there's absolutely
no shimmer undertones that's why I
really like it and I don't feel like you
need too much of it just like I'm gonna
put quite a bit on cuz it will wear off
but I feel like it's just really pretty
against the bronzer as well now I'm
going to zoom in the camera and we are
going to transform at my eyes into
something a little bit more interesting
I'm feeling like a pinky look today like
a champagne pop for the eye look I'm
going to be using the coloured raine
Queen of Hearts palette and I did a
first impressions tutorial using one of
the shades in this palette and I fell in
love I think it's absolutely insane the
color range is amazing and you can get
it from beauty base so all the products
will be linked down below if you do want
to buy them but I think this palette is
just gorgeous
so my eyes are already at primed using
and my foundation and concealer and then
set with powder so first of all I'm
going to go in with the shade princess
and this is just going to give
me kind of like a nice transition shade
to build on work on I've kind of forgot
how much of each shade I'm gonna need
like how pigmented they are but that's a
lot more pigmented than I thought it was
so maybe I didn't need as much that's
such a pretty color I can't get over how
pretty today is I just realized I
haven't done my eyebrows after I've put
the transition shade on and my eyebrows
are being done I just looked at myself
and I was like yeah something's missing
my eyebrows I'm gonna drag the
transition shade all the way into the
middle because I'm going to be doing
kind of like a half cut crease from the
inner corner so now I'll do the
transition change I'm just gonna pause
the camera and fill in my eyebrows but i
use the anastasia beverly hills dipbrow
this is such a good product that i've
nearly used the whole pot I used to hate
hair I just never could get on with it
but I think it's just the first initial
layer of the product where it's very mu
see that I didn't get on with but once
it kind of dries out a little bit really
good but the reason I never do my
eyebrows on camera itch is because I do
really weird face angles so I am going
to go away through my eyebrows and then
I will be back and I'm back sorry my
eyebrows like two different colors
because the way the lighting is going
promise you they're not I use the same
product for both this one just looks
darker I've done it the first shade and
now I am going to go in with the shade
ladyship and this is kind of a very
pigmented purple shade and I'm gonna pop
this in the outer crease in the hopes
that it blends really nicely I'm just
feeling a very rose gold perfectly look
today one that I have a redone a long
time to be honest you to do burgundy but
I've never really done like rose gold
purple so and then just repeat that on
the other eye I feel like the shades in
this palette especially the two that
I've used a very unique shades like I've
never really seen the peachy tone that I
used the transition shade before and I
personally never really seen a purple
color like this either so that is all
blended and it worked in so now I am
just going to take a bit more of a flat
head brush and just pop the shade
nobleman which is kind of like purpley
burgundy glitter in the outer crease as
well I am going to add loose later but
after I've done eyeliner
I've worked out they're doing it after
eyeliner is so much better this shade no
woman is super super pretty it's a lot
more red toned I'm obsessed I love it
and then again it just repeat it on the
other eye just blend it all of that in
and making sure you're dragging the
glitter evenly across the lid something
I'm gonna do now is something that I've
really enjoyed doing recently and it's
just taking a white shade and kind of
cutting the crease from the inside just
to give it a bit more dimension and a
bit more structure I feel like the way
I've done it now is absolutely fine and
like I could add glitter in it we look
really nice but I feel like the white
just adds that little extra something
that you need I'm just gonna take this
skinny dip marble brush and take the
shade crown which is this glittery why I
mean I would prefer it to be matte but I
just want to stick to one palette and
I'm just going to cut the crease with
this I'm not using any concealer or
anything it's literally just a glittery
white shade just to add a little bit
more dimension and then of course you
have to blend that into the purple as
well which can be hard because the white
shade is literally looks really pretty
and then I'm just gonna repeat that on
the other eye it's really easy to do you
just want to follow the natural shape of
your eye really that's what I do anyway
like I haven't done it properly with
concealer and stuff because that just
takes so long it doesn't even rework on
me but as you can see a read does add
something extra to the eye look which I
feel like it just makes it look more
structured and warp it together now I'm
gonna go in it with honest I have two
here but I feel like one of these is
running out so I've got the Maybelline
master precise which is the one running
out and then I've got the ICO skinny
liquid black liner which got sent to my
PO box so I think I'm gonna give this
one a go because I've never tried it
before my mum has been using it and it's
really good so just give me two seconds
I'll have to go in silence because you
know I've gotta concentrate it's good
but I definitely wouldn't say it's
skinny the Maybelline master precise is
a lot more skinnier this is a lot more
black I'm definitely gonna have to make
that sharp with concealer instead I've
been able to do it with the pen which is
really annoying doing eyeliner stresses
me out so much but that's what it looks
like it's really good but
thing is on the outer edge it's not
sharp so I'm gonna have to cut that with
concealer I'm just gonna do that other
way and then I will get back to you guys
so now I have it cleared up the eyeliner
I'm actually obsessed with this look so
I'm gonna go in with these eyelashes
here which I don't know what brand
therefrom so I will figure out and then
I will leave it in the description box
down below so I'm gonna pop these
eyelashes on and then I am gonna go in
with this little tower of NYX glitters
and at the bottom there's this gorgeous
pink rose gold shade so I'm gonna pop
that on my lid as well and to do that
I'm going to use the Too Faced glitter
glue but I cannot do anything on camera
so literally in three two one boom I
love it I've added some a pink glitter
and a big lashes and I feel like this is
a bit of a Valentine's Day look like
even though I have nothing to do in
Valentine sakes I'm single AF I feel
like this is a really good Valentine's
Day look I love it so now I'm going to
zoom back out or we're gonna finish the
rest of my face so for highlighter I'm
going to be using a highlighter that I
used to be obsessed with I haven't used
in a while and this is the sleek makeup
highlighting palette in Cleopatra's kiss
it's very dirty and I am going to use my
Real Techniques setting brush for this
and I'm just gonna mix of both
highlighters together and just wipe them
on my cheeks this is such a beautiful
highlighter like it gives such a natural
glow without looking too like in your
face I thought this is very daytime
where I really like it and then we're
just gonna pop it on the other cheek oh
my gosh I'm feeling this I'm gonna have
to wear this more often then on my
Cupid's bow as well because I love
highlighting my Cupid's bow and I'm also
gonna put on the end of my nose because
I feel like that just makes my makeup
look can I put on the end of my nose yes
I am obsessed now for lips I'm gonna go
in with the color that I haven't used in
a while and I used it I have it in my
makeup bag all the time but this is the
Mac retro matte lipstick in a burnt
spice and I feel like this is gonna
complement the eyes quite nicely so
let's pop this on my lips and assume it
looks like I like this shade that's
really different on everybody because
when saffron used it in our makeup bag
swap video I feel like it looked more
nude on her but I feel like it looks
more brown on me it's super smooth to
apply them and I get apply so easy
that's the bottom lip and I actually
feel like that it's really nice so
that's a really nice color so here is
the finished go a makeup look I feel
like it is actually quite Valentine's
Day you feel I'm feeling it I really
like it it's a very different look to
what I usually go for I don't usually
wear pinks and purples on my eyes I tend
to either stick to nude burgundy or
brown I think it's really really pretty
I really like it I love all the makeup
ROK's I used even the foundation has
grown on me a lot so that is the end of
this video I really hope you guys have
enjoyed it
give it a massive thumbs up if you
enjoyed this very very glam look it's
something very different for me but I
really hope you guys like it I'm really
feeling it like I'm really really
feeling it like I'm buzzing say hello to
photos I love you all so so so much but
I will see you on at Wednesday at 6 p.m.
so a brand new video
