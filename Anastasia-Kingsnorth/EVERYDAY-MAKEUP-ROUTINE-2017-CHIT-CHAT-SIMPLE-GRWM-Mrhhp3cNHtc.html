and I am going to be doing my everyday
makeup routine for 2017 now I haven't
done the makeup tutorial in what feels
like way over a year so I thought I
would come back do my everyday makeup
routine for you as an extra video and it
is been requested so much for you guys
to see how I do makeup and even though I
do it in my daily vlogging channel quite
a lot I thought I'd come my main channel
and do a makeup look that you guys can
really follow for everyday wear or back
to school so yeah it is a very subtle
very natural glowy look as you can see
the highlight it is a poppin yeah I
really hope you enjoy the video and
let's just get started I'm going to
start off by going in with my Smashbox
photo finish foundation primer and this
is it color correcting adjust one so
it's actually green because I have very
red skin as you can see now a mini story
time I actually just filmed this whole
makeup routine and then I went to watch
it back quickly Lotus before I put it on
my laptop and everything and the whole
thing was out of focus and you literally
I would look either like a blur and I
don't even know how that happened
because I had the view finder out I
swear I was a keen eye and I was in
focus and obviously wasn't so I had some
reviews and make it work to wipe my
makeup off everything apart from my
eyebrows because I really didn't want to
do them again so yeah that's it happened
so my skin is actually a little bit more
red than usual because I have just
rubbed it but yeah that foundation
primer is incredible and it's so smooth
it's not a silicone base as the other
/what ones out which I like so yeah I
got this from busy village and it was
only 20 pounds lot down from 30 so
definitely recommend this then as a
foundation I'm going to go in with my
L'Oreal Paris
True Match super blender bullet
foundation and mine is in the shade 1.10
ivory and then with this I use my Real
Techniques Beauty Blender so everybody
does foundation differently personally
for me I like to dot it on my skin I
find that this gives me the best
coverage all around instead of kind of
like smearing it down my face and yeah I
just find it really easy to blend
now this law really not blend so well
like if you just say super blendable and
that's because it's so chewy and kind of
like
Quinny but not liquid to the point it
would drip off your face
just like so smooth it's not like a
master tool which I like because matte
foundations dry up my skin like maps but
this foundation is so good and to be say
actually still a little dark for me
because I get a lot of clients like
blender foundation down your neck and I
do but I'm just very very very pale so
it's quite hard to get the right shade
but it's going to blend this all down
like that like I said I just like to
blend this in using my Real Techniques
Beauty Blender basic foundation it does
give me really good coverage it now
didn't give me like as much coverage as
I'm sure a high-end one would but to be
honest I use quite a bit of concealer so
are you sure your foundation to kind of
give me more of an even skin tone to
kind of work upon the foundation is only
ten pounds and you can buy it from some
dog or boots and I would definitely say
it's one of the best drugstore
foundations
I've personally ever tried leave your
recommendations down below for good
foundations because I have a very very
very oily skin so vibrations like this
work really well on me but if you have
one that you think is best I'll leave it
down below and I'll definitely give it a
try when blending on my nose as well it
tends to not give me as much coverage
because my nose is very red and very
oily so I do struggle around this area
of my face and then now go be very
careful because I normally saw our
eyebrows in after but I really don't
want to wipe them off because I spent so
long doing them on camera giving you
guys a tutorial and it wasn't even in
focus so if you do want an eyebrow
tutorial then let me know and I would
definitely do went in the makeup
tutorial it is also like a really good
makeup look for back-to-school as well
because it's quite natural and obviously
you don't have to use all of the
products so you could definitely use
this for back-to-school I know I am
quite pale like I'm literally one of the
lightest shade because I just don't tan
and when I do fake tan I don't like
going by myself into the foundation for
every single shade of color that I go I
just stick with one and blend it a bit
down my neck because ain't nobody got
money to go buy ten different bowls
foundation now I'm going to go in it
with concealer a little bit Kat Von D
lock-it concealer this is actually
nearly run out because I you
every single day so I think I showed
this in a hall I got it when I went to
Birmingham because they literally have
so much Kat Von D stuff but it's
absolutely incredible like that you can
literally see how much is left by how
much is coming out just barely only
coming out onto my face but I love this
so much it was about 20 pounds I think
but it's a really good coverage so I
definitely was buy again I'm actually
waiting to get my heart-shaped cake
because SAFF picked it up three measures
in America but I haven't been to her
house to go and get it yet but she was
showing it on face time last night and I
was just dying it looks incredible this
concealer is very very easy to blend as
out is nice it goes well around my nose
area which is where I need the most
coverage and it also is a good under-eye
concealer and doesn't really cause much
creasing another good treat for this
would be the collection lasting
perfection I'd say those two concealers
are very similar
the collection probably looks a bit more
during which I do prefer then I'm just
going to go over this with mine are
creamy concealer I love this concealer
as well it's amazing again it don't
really have much left but I tend to just
use this more for spots than anything
else so I just pop this around it might
super super troubled areas which at the
moment isn't actually my chin as much as
it used to be it's more here I never
used to get spots there so I was reading
about it I think it's diet so I've got
to sort the dark out but they're not bad
spots at all and we'll just get the
lemon shoes because once I get a spy
tends to scarfs if you guys have any
tips for blemishes or anything please do
let me know because that will come in a
lot of handy now I've got my face done
I'm going to go in and press it so this
is the Laura Mercier translucent powder
and it is just a loose setting powder
honestly I love this I used to use the
NYX HD powder but it was very very white
and I could not use it like when I
reflected myself in the Sun when the Sun
shone on me or you could see was white
and it has been look quite a tall so I
finally gave in to the hype because
everybody was talking about this powder
and I was like you know what it's 30
pounds but I'm going to go by anyway and
I literally regret not buying it earlier
like I don't like carve out my contour
with it or anything
I'll let you do just use that as
assessing powder but it's incredible and
then I'll just leave this on my face
while I go over Angele my eyebrows so
I'm just going to add a little bit more
color to them because sort of it worn
off when I was drugged you our makeup
off so I actually use the ideal medium
brown brow pomade and this is a really
good shape for the Anastasia Beverly
Hills one now if you guys haven't heard
of the outer edge of ebony Hills one
don't always been because everybody uses
it I think this is actually a lot better
this is only 8 pounds from super-drunk
or boots I normally go super drove to be
fair and it's so good I love this so
much I love having like the line
underneath my eyebrow I'm just going to
sharpen that up a little bit then I'll
carve out a little bit of concealer but
yeah I just thought like to have my rod
quite dark and bold because especially
since I dyed my hair and my hair is a
bit blonder so I think having more
eyebrows a bit more bold makes it stand
out a little bit more so yeah I'll just
err on my eyebrows a little bit and then
I will carve them out I usually use a
pop concealer but I don't actually have
them right now so I'm just going to have
to use my NARS creamy concealer again
don't really have much this right now
either so not going very strong but I'm
just going to pop this around the tips
and at the front just to make them a
little bit more sharp I like to remember
the times where I didn't fill in my
eyebrows and makeup tutorials and like
at all and I honestly look so much
different
like eyebrows really do shape your face
and you don't realize it until you start
putting them in I actually do need to
add a little bit more color at the front
on this one as well so what I do is I
just spike my brush up like this and add
a little bit more color this RL today's
definitely gone better than the other
one but you know what eyebrows are
sisters and not twins
so that is absolutely fine they don't
always look the same and know what their
near enough the same that can do and
then I just get my Beauty Blender and
I'll just blend this around just to make
sure everything is filled in and blended
then I'm going to take my morphe eat
full brush and I'm just going to blend
in all of the translucent setting powder
now I would usually leave it for longer
but obviously like my eyebrows already
filled in so I didn't have to leave it
as long as today like I usually would I
use the entities on there
ten minutes but either way is still
sexual makeup incredibly and I would
100% recommend this powder eye then
you're going to go in with my Anastasia
Beverly Hills contour kit again I love
this contour kit so much so I'm going to
use a mixture of all three of these
shades and I don't really do my contour
to like carve it out and have like a
straight line I don't really do that I
just do it to add color back into my
face therefore it does tend to look a
bit like blusher but it's just making my
face look a bit more healthy I also drag
it down my chin not my chin my jawbone
as dogs I don't really have much of a
talking going on and they'll also drag
it up to my forehead as well because I
am quite pale I do like to be you know
simple healthy looking and glowy looking
so I will just drag this up to my
forehead and add quite a bit of color
back to my face contour makes such a
difference I also remember the times
where I didn't wear contour and wow did
my makeup look bad they have to be very
careful because you can look very
actually if you use the wrong shade of
contour so make sure you're using the
right shade again the light to medium
palette from Anastasia Beverly Hills is
exactly what I needed like it's very
Brown toned it's not gray toned at all
which I like and then I'll just brush
the excess over my skin you're going
just to give me a little bit more color
back and then you look a little bit more
healthy I'm then going to go in with my
violet Voss palette this is incredible
look how gorgeous this talent is and I'm
just going to use the shade besty I'm
just going to drag this all along my I
don't know what you call it the crease I
got in the end I'm just going to drag
this in the crease very very lightly
nothing too major just quite a subtle
color just so my mascara stands out a
little bit more I love a matte eyeshadow
like my eyeshadows are definitely my
favorite I love a good shimmer but I
just feel like they look a bit weird and
tacky on me sometimes so I just like to
add like completely matte and then go in
with like magic lift out if I'm going to
do that then I'm just going to go in the
with the shade are you kissing me just
to again darken it up a little bit
because it's not as pigmented as I
thought it was going to be so just going
to darken that up a little bit
just to give it a little bit more
definition I really want to be able to
do a cut crease if you guys do want to
see a cut crease then and let me know
once I've done that I will then go in
with mascara so I have two mascaras that
I'm loving at the moment the first one
is the Maybelline the colossal what Big
Shot and the next one is the Mac bold
and it bad lash so I'm going to start
off with the drugstore one and I'm just
going to do one eye on camera one eye
off camera so basically what I like to
do is I just like to use this on my top
lashes just to separate them and add a
bit more color back to them because once
I've done a shadow and foundation I tend
to have quite gray lashes so just to
make them a little bit more black and
just to add to the length I will use
this Maybelline one the other Maybelline
mascara that I'm absolutely in love with
is the lash sensational but mine is
actually run out so that is definitely
next on my list as you can see I just
make kind of like a subtle difference
but then this Mac bag and bold lash
actually has a big brush and then it has
a little brush for your lower lashes so
this is amazing I think it's actually
new out as well so it's absolutely
incredible and I'm just going to pop
this over the top of the Maybelline one
and as you can see this does make them a
lot bolder and I'm not blacker I'd like
to get far down to the roots as possible
and then just kind of shimmer it up just
a little little separated but just to
make sure they look as long as possible
so that is my top lashes done and then
I'm going to go in with the lower lash
brush just to add a little bit more
color and a little bit more length to my
lower lashes I'm very careful when doing
this just to make sure it doesn't go
into my eyes but I do love this and I'm
just going to go over my top lashes with
it as well just to make sure that all
separated just like so and that is
basically the difference in wearing
mascara and eye mascara as you can see
there is a very big difference to what
my makeup that looks like when I do wear
mascara so definitely mascara is one of
my Holy Grail makeup products now I'm
just going to go do the other eye and
then I'll move on to the rest of my
makeup that is - go Regina so now I'm
going to go in it with highlight so I'm
going to use the nip and fab
highlighting palette
ever since this got sent to my PO Box
I've been using it and I've been
absolutely loving it so using a bit more
feet art 37 brush I'm going to take
these two shades mix them together and
just pop them on my cheekbones these two
are the I would say less pigmented for
my skin tone in the palate I don't use
the darker shade as that is way too dark
for my skin tone but the other five mix
together our perfect then I'll go in
with these two shades again just on top
just to build up the color and build up
the reflection and oh guys can you see
that it's just incredible do it on the
other side and it just reflects the
light beautifully and just catches it
wherever it's beaming then finally I'll
go in with this banana a yellow shade
and as you can see this is really what
finishes it off for me the banana a
yellow shade for me are definitely my
favorite highlighters they catch Sun so
beautifully and work perfectly on my
skintone I'm just going to pop it on my
Cupid's bow as well and then also pop it
on the end of my nose at the end of my
nose is the best place for me for
highlighter it looks so good in pictures
and I just love how it looks then just
going to add some of that in the inner
corner of my eyes as well just to make
them pop a little bit more because even
though I do have all your skin I love my
skin to look quite glowy as well I'm
going to go highlight my brow bone as
well this doesn't really do much for me
but I just like to do it so I've done it
and tea nice little bit more glowy then
I'm just going to take my the bodyshop
fan brush and just blend all of this
into my skin just so it doesn't look wet
but just so it looks very glowy then I'm
going to go in with my Too Faced melted
map in child star this is a very very
very nude lip but I love this for an
everyday makeup look to face are
definitely my favorite lip color brand
to face and color pop do the best ones
for me I also always get a lot of
questions on my lips now I haven't had
little is I'm 16 no I don't overdraw my
lips they're just quite naturally big
and bumpy but yet this is
every day and makeup and look it's quite
natural it's quite subtle but it could
be perfect for school it's perfect that
everyday wear and obviously you could
spice it up a bit more you can add
eyeliner lashes a lot more eyeshadow a
darker lip but I just like you kind of
like subtle look so yeah if you did
