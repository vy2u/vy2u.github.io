going to be doing a school get ready
with me including nails a hair and a
natural makeup tutorial so I'm really
lucky to be working with most forty on
this video and as you'll notice from the
makeup and the nail section I'm going to
be using some miss 40 products and some
of them are from their new integral
range which is amazing and they're all
available from boots and Superdrug I'm
really excited for this video as
obviously a lot of my viewers and I as
well go to school so I'm always looking
for like natural makeup looks easy hair
tutorials and natural now like color to
wear and tutorial to use and I have been
loving this look personally this is what
I've been wearing at the moment to
school this hair just really natural
nails and makeup so I thought I would
show you how to recreate it as I said
the makeup tutorial is all drugstores is
all available from boots and Superdrug
it's really easy accessible and really
inexpensive miss 40 is really affordable
as well which is always really helpful
as obviously what your teenagers and
makeup can be quite expensive sometimes
so yeah that's basically what I'm doing
today I hope you enjoy the video and I'm
just going to get started so to start
off my drugstore makeup tutorial I'm
taking the new Miss 40 into the glow
primer this is perfect if you're looking
for a very radiant complexion yet you
want your makeup to stay on all day as
obviously we're at school for quite a
long time sometimes up to like 8 or 9
hours so you always definitely want a
complexion that's going to make your
makeup last all day
next moving on to concealer i'm using
the l'oreal true match concealer and as
you can see this is very orange toned
but as i have quite a lot of redness i
have to counteract it out and orbitons
concealers leave a really highlighted
finish yet gives you a lot of coverage
especially when I'm using a Beauty
Blender so I just use the Real
Techniques sponge to blend this all out
and it gives me a really even flawless
coverage however if you feel like you
need more coverage I would recommend the
L'Oreal true match foundation or the new
into glow foundation from Miss sporty
they're both really high coverage and
perfect for school
next you have to obviously set your
concealer into place so I just took my
Rimmel stay matte powder this is a
really trustworthy powder from the
drugstore and it's only 399 or so so
it's really cheap and affordable and
it's a really really good powder and
it's probably one of the only powders
that keeps our makeup on all day without
letting a some oil through once I've
done my complexion and is all pretty
much even I like to bring back some
color into my face so I just took the
new miss 40 into the glow blush in 0:06
shiny coral and this is probably my
favorite blush from the range it's kind
of a dusty rose color yet this is the
perfect blush color I go for and as you
can see it's really pigmented for the
price as I'm very much into the Julie
look for school I like to highlight my
face so I just add the balm mary-lou
manizer on my cheekbones my Cupid's bow
and in my inner corner they recently
made this available in super drug and
it's a really really good highlighter is
one of the only highlighters that I
found it's super pigmented and for the
price it's so worth it for mascara I've
recently been using the miss 40 fabulous
lash stretch hit mascara and I love this
because it's super buildable so you can
have a really light layer and your
lashes will look really natural and
fluttery or you can definitely build it
up to make them more thick black and
long I really like the thick and black
look so I add quite a bit of mascara but
of course as this is buildable it's
completely up to you and you can apply
it in so many different ways finally to
finish off my makeup look i use the miss
40 instant lip color and shine in the
new shade and the thing i love about
these is again just like the mascara
they are super buildable so you can have
them really natural or you can layer
them up and make it more of a darker
nude shade i like to keep it quite light
and natural for school but overall i
really rate these lip products
so this is the finished makeup tutorial
as you can see it's really really
natural and really pretty I didn't want
to do anything too high coverage or too
expensive
that wouldn't be easily recreated also I
want to do something that was really
relatable to everybody and I really
really like this look I've been wearing
this to school and even though I get
really oily the primers really helped my
skin and its really Condit down actually
so this is the makeup look I really like
it
very natural so now I'm going to move on
to the hair so for the hairstyle I'm
going to be showing you how to do Dutch
braids
the thing about Dutch braids is they are
so simple yet it's just mastering the
art of how to do them so all you want to
do is take three pieces and plat them
normally first do three strands over and
then once you've done that and you can
see the plat starting to form begin to
pick up more hair before you plot that
strand over as I plat over mine turn
into Dutch braids however if you plat
underneath you will turn into French
braids I am just used to playing over I
actually can't do French braids on
myself but I can do Dutch braids so I
would just do that and do that until
there was no hair left making sure you
pick up every single last strand and
make sure you pull really tightly as
well as you don't want them falling out
through the day so I just really really
pull them like really tight so they go
super tight and I would just then plat
down my hair until I reach the bottom
and I will just tie it off with a thin
elastic band and that's the hair
tutorial is so simple and really
effective for PE and it's just something
really different for school and I love
it this is the finished hair tutorial I
absolutely love it it's just like it's
just Dutch braids and obviously as I
said it's like depending on whether you
braid over or under as it's going to
work like this because I braid over it
turns into Dutch braids but I love it
it's so good for P as well obviously
because it all has to do PE which it's
kind of fun kind of not so yeah I have
to have my hair up sometimes if he even
though I do off and leave it down but
it's just a really nice hairstyle to
have really for school and it keeps it
out of your face as well just always
handy so yeah that was the hair tutorial
I'm now going to move on
to a nail tutorial and it's basically
just a few nail colors that you could
use and a few of my recommendations as
well because I have quite a lot of
recommended nail polishes from the
drugstore as I only ever use drugstore
nail polishes
so for school again I like to keep it
very natural and neutral with my nail
shades so I use the clubbing color by
miss sporty and this is a less than one
minute quick dry polish and this is just
in a really nice pastel pink shade I
love this and I'm not the best at
painting my nails paint them and I was
quite frustrated sometimes because I
can't paint them properly but I do try
my best and I just like to keep them as
I said very natural for school so I'll
just paint my nails with a Miss 40 nail
polish and then use a Maybelline dr.
Eskew topcoat just to seal the design in
so if that was my school makeup hair and
now tutorial I really hope you enjoyed
it I had so much fun filming this as

mean I've done some before but never
