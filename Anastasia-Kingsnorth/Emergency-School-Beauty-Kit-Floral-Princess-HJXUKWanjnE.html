doing a emergency school beauty kit so
this has always been a really requested
video what I did like her what's in my
school bag a while ago everybody said
please do a emergency school beauty kit
so I thought that I was finally do one
as I finally kind of sorted out one that
I take school every single day in my
school bag so yeah I hope you enjoy it
and let's get straight into it for my
emergency school bag is the zoella just
say yes makeup bags a pencil case so
this one was seven pounds from superdrug
and it's just a passively pink coral
color with golden dots and it is
personally my favorite up the three that
she's portal I think it's really
motivating and it's just amazing quality
as well so Easter sauce silk inside and
shiny and if you get makeup on the
outside you can just wipe it off which
is what I love so where didn't you open
at the makeup bag
the first thing I have inside is my
brush and this is just my black tangle
teezer
nothing special about this really it's
just a black compact tangle teezer and
I'm gonna link all these products down
below this one was from Amazon for eight
or nine pounds and then always carry a
spare hair bottle with me even though
I'm probably be wearing one in my hair I
just like to carry a spare just in case
anything bad happens I also like to
carry some ham product so I first of all
carry a cypher glory hand food because
this is just really moisturizing
it just makes my hands feel really soft
and nice and I just really like this I
then always carry with me a Bath and
Body Works pocket back and has the
vanilla berry sorbet one which is my
current favorite for the springtime I
then carry with me a Ted Baker London
body spray so this is just one from
boots and it was only two pounds 50 and
I think this is gorgeous
I don't know why I'm just obsessed with
the parcel houses on the front I think
it's so so nice and it matches I think
it matters in so Elif act really nicely
I don't know even it's really nice
together and this was two pounds fifty
for me one of my very big school
essentials are the Real Techniques on
location and mini brush trio I will
always have this with me at school and
my friends laugh at the you I put on my
powder with the pink brush so just sit
there and like double check on my powder
though these are only eight pounds and I
think it's really cheap for three-wheel
Techniques brushes they're really really
good quality they just fit in
perfectly probably because I have like
really small hands but there were only
eight pounds and you get like a mini
shadow brush a mini foundation brush and
a mini multitasking face brush so I use
the multitask face brush for blush and
powder the foundation brush and
Foundation and concealer and then that I
brush I don't really use quite don't
tend to wear eye shadow to school but
it's still a really handy on-the-go trio
to have I also keep some girly things
that girls always need to carry with
them in there I'm not going to show
those pecans I just don't really feel
like showing them today I then always
carry my makeup that I'm wearing so the
maker of the I would normally wear on an
everyday basis is first of all the
collection lasting perfection concealer
which is my holy grail conceal the
Rimmel stay matte powder in 0:05 silky
beige the NYX blush in rose garden which
is a stunning like under toned pink
glitter that didn't make sense but it's
beautiful
bourgeois one second Volume Mascara the
Maybelline lash sensational lash
multiplying mascara which is my favorite
and I chose a lip product which would
most probably be the L'Oreal collection
exclusive by Julianne color is Julian's
nude it's really really long and mine's
like a bit worse for wear now because
I've worn it so much but it's my
favorite color and I would love this
product forever also carry a ton of hair
grips with me because she'll always need
her hair grips so there's everything I
keep in my emergency school beauty care
I decide to keep this with me just in
case I need to top up throughout the day
and feel fresh so yeah that is basically
what I carry I hope you enjoyed this
short and sweet video let me know what
other videos you would like to see soon
and I hope you enjoyed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
