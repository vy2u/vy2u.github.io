makeup routine to start off with and
then I turn it into this look inspired
by Mavis which is a character from photo
Transylvania 2 so home to Transylvania 2
comes out of the very the 15th and to
coincide with that I wanted to kind of
create a makeup tutorial that you could
recreate but I wanted to do it so that
you could wear it in the day and the
night so I did a daytime version and a
nighttime version if you want to read a
bit more about how to Transylvania you
can go into the description box and
click the links there and you can go to
any different social medias and
everything like that so today's look
again is this fly by Mavis and the
Croatian photo Transylvania - I decided
to give away five DVDs to five lucky
people so if you want to win at one of
these whole Drive Transylvania 2 DVDs
all you have to do is comment down below
the word Mavis and finally you will get
them sent out to you so as I said this
is also my everyday makeup routine which
I'm very excited about because this is a
requested video and I really wanted to
do this so yeah I hope you enjoyed the
video and let's get started so for my
makeup look today I've already done up
my primer and my base as I can't lie to
focus on the rest of the features so I
used my Nivea postman shave balm for the
primer this is amazing it gives such an
even skin tone coverage to kind of work
on and build on and I really really like
it it's a really good consistency as
well and then I went in with my
Maybelline new dream velvet soft matte
hydrating foundation this is money
Foundation at the moment it's my
favorite I've been loving it it's only 8
pounds as I often like super drunk or
boots which is really really good and
obviously made this who this one is
inspired by it has a very very flawless
coverage and her skin is perfectly
smooth and I love that that's what her
skin looks like so I went with a really
smooth even coverage I'm now going to go
in with concealer so I'm gonna be using
the NARS creamy concealer as you can see
I have a very very annoying red spoil
the moment I don't know where that came
from
but I really need to cover that up
because it's causing my makeup to look a
little bit cakey against the rest of my
skin tone so this nice can see that is
very very good at covering redness I
find it's not good under the eyes but I
find it a really good for covering like
redness
dark areas as you can see if you've
covered it early it's amazing concealer
I already know what's happening at the
moment I'm just having a few breakouts
and it's quite annoying but you know
what we're all girls it happens and
we've just got to get through it
together okay so now I'm going to be
going with powder so this is the L'Oreal
Paris infallible 24-hour matte powder
and I'm just going to use this powder
brush to apply this this is such a
highly pigmented powder it just that
fires everything down and I love it and
I just got powned it in my eye and it's
flying everywhere right now and it have
a sorry part as you can see that is all
of my powder done it is very mattified
and quite paying as well because I
really don't suit kind of like darker
tones makeup because I'm very like light
skin toned and maybe seems to - that is
perfect so now I'm going to go in with a
blush so this is the Milani baked blush
in number 5 luminoso I'm just going to
take my Real Techniques blush brush for
this and even though this looks like it
wouldn't be that pigmented it is
extremely pigmented like very light pink
it's not showing up as well as it is in
real life on camera but it's gorgeous
and it is like the perfect flush I've
been loving especially for the
springtime as well because it's not too
much it's just quite natural and I
really like it so in the springtime I
absolutely love a kind of flawless base
makeup that type of thing going on so of
course I've got to add a bit of
highlighter so I'm going to go in with
my I was gonna say benefit the bomb
mary-lou manizer this is amazing
it suits Mabus his look perfectly as
well because it's very shimmery and as I
said made mrs. hazard a flawless
complexion and I just love a bit of
highlighter along with cheekbones it
just adds a little bit more to a makeup
look and I were wearing this every day
also want to keep its boat because
you've got to add it there also just add
a little bit to the brow bone then for
feeling adventurous and you really want
to go highlighted highlighted absent
angle nose once I've done that I just
like to brush over all of my makeup with
this brush this is the Real Techniques
duo-fiber face brush I
it really good if I just brush over all
of my makeup and it kind of gets rid of
any loose particles and this makes my
makeup last longer because I often find
that I forget to blend some of the
powder in or the blusher so I let's just
go over this and of course it is a clean
brush it was not adding anything to my
face isn't it - Regis toning it down and
making sure that it's all flat now we're
going to move on to eyes so I'm using
the Too Faced chocolate bar palette
today because I love this palette and I
recently got it I spoke about it in a
previous haul and I want to start off
with a very light makeup that I would
usually use and then I'm going to turn
it into my night makeup look that made
this would wear so I'm going to start
off by going in the crease with a shade
called hazelnut this is a quite
pigmented actually I used it yesterday
and it there's a lot more pigmented than
I originally thought so I'm just going
to run this all along my crease this is
a really pretty hazelnutty brown color
the things I love about the Too Faced
palette colors are the colors literally
but the names describe what it is
so like the champagne truffle one it's
like a light pink and the salted caramel
I know I've just been saying the wrong
names
sorry the one I'm using is salted
caramel I just realized I said that
wrong in my last video as well but yeah
I'm just going salted caramel all and on
my crease so that is the first color
done and then I'm just going to go in
with a little bit of marzipan and I'm
just gonna apply this all in the eyelid
like the middle of the eyelid because
this is such a gorgeous shimmery color
and I love to add a bit of shimmer to my
eyes my eye makeup doesn't look right
and s is shimmering today I'm then going
in with mascara so I'm going in with my
favorite mascara which is the Maybelline
lash sensational as you can see I don't
really do much to my makeup I like to
keep it quite natural for spring
especially because every day I don't
really like to go quite dramatic I like
for it to be quite quick and easy to do
and I don't like to use too many
products either especially in the
daytime so that is why I only use 2
eyeshadow colors with the
time love this mascara is so good as you
can see although I'm having a few
problems at the moment with my left eye
I don't know what is happening with it
but I am losing eyelashes rapidly which
is obviously not good I don't know where
they're going but I'm finding it a lot
harder to apply mascara to it because of
the loss of my lashes but nevertheless
we're powering through and I will make
it work also just going to add a little
bit to my bottom eyelashes I don't like
to add too much because I often find
that they don't quite spidery if I add a
lot but I'm just going to add a little
bit more so just gonna add a little bit
more blush because I like to add a bit
more blush brings a bit of color back
into my face I'm then finally gonna go
in with my lip color and this is the
matte lipstick info I love this shade
and that is my daytime spring everyday
makeup look
so now this isn't my daytime look I'm
going to turn my everyday daytime look
into maybe seas night look so maybe this
has a very dark toned eye and lips so
I'm going to be really spicing it up and
if you have a spring night out that
you're going to want to go on to gonna
want to go on to if you have a spring
that out that you have planned I'm going
to show you a makeup tool for that
inspired by May this so the complexion
that I already have is very much like
her so I'm just going to go in with a
bit more eye shadow so I'm going to
again use the Too Faced chocolate bar
palette but instead I'm going to go in
with the shade semi-sweet and this is a
very dark matte Brown and I'm just going
to apply this into my outer corner and
blend that out obviously you can go very
dramatic with this because it is a
nighttime look and mavis his eyes are
very very dark now for me that's still
not dark enough so I'm going to go in
with a bit of Horta chocolate I think I
said that right mixed with amaretto
which is an even darker Brown and I'm
just going to carry on blending this to
make it really dark and smoky
so as you can see my eyes are looking a
bit more darker now and I love this look
because it looks exactly like me versus
maybe it's obviously uses black
eyeshadow but I wanted to go for brown
black very very dark brown because I
love how that looks
and then finally to turn it in to make
this a little bit more I'm gonna go in
with a very very dark blue color and
this is the Too Faced melted chocolate
in chocolate cherries which I'm very
very excited to use so now I'm going to
pop this on my hips so that is the end
of my made this inspired makeup tutorial
I really hope you enjoyed it give it a
huge thumbs up if you did and I will see
you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
