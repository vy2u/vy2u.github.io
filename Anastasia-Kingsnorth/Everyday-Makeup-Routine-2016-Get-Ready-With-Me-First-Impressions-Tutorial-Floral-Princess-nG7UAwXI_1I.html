to be doing at my spring /summer get
ready with me for 2016 so I like to do
updated get ready with me and kind of
show you what my go-to makeup and hair
is and this edition is just going to be
my kind of casual everyday edition this
is kind of what I would do probably when
I'm going shopping or when I'm just
going out for the day with my mother and
my friends or anything like that I don't
do any of these for school this is kind
of just for like the weekends but I'm so
excited this video because I've put so
much effort into it and I've used a
bunch of new product that I've shown
like previously in hauls but I haven't
done like a first impressions on so this
is kind of also like a first impressions
video but yeah I really hope you enjoy
the video if you did it please give it a
thumbs up I would be so grateful if we
could reach 7000 thumbs up on this video
because we do that on giveaway videos
but not on normal videos so please
thumbs it up hold it up but yeah I hope
you enjoy the video and let's get stuff
to start off my makeup look I decided to
use the benefit Porefessional primer
this is a really good primer if you have
large pores like me as I have oily skin
which releases a lot of blemishes I tend
to have really open pores so this just
hide them and conceals them for a
perfect base of my makeup
for foundation I decided to do a mini
review on the brand new fit me matte and
poreless foundation from the drugstore
so I included this in a haul of while
ago and I actually really liked it this
was the second time that I'd warrior and
it is really really good for oily skin
as I said I have oily skin therefore I
need a foundation that is going to last
all day and as you can see you can
clearly see it giving an extra layer of
coverage which I really like it's the
perfect shade it blends really easy and
it's just really long-lasting
considering I have such all your skin
for concealer I just thought with my
Holy Grail concealer which is the
collection last imperfection you guys
know that I'm forever wearing this this
is the only concealer that I've
genuinely genuinely liked as it just
gives me a really good coverage and even
though again I have oily skin this case
eye makeup on for a substantial amount
of the day I mean it doesn't cover
everything on my face but it's the best
concealer that I've found I really want
to try the Urban Decay Naked skin one so
leave your reviews on that if you have
it down below to mattify everything down
I just took the Maybelline fit me powder
I wanted to use the powder that matched
the foundation and this is a really good
powder it doesn't keep me matte for the
amount of time it is meant to however it
does keep me matte for the majority of
the day so overall I do really like this
product
I then took the brand-new Maybelline
brick bronzer so I absolutely love this
I couldn't get over how amazing this was
it's not too harsh yet it's not too soft
I just find it's the perfect shade and
color I need for my skin and it really
does like bring out my cheekbones and
the features of my face and I'm
definitely going to make this and
everyday Holy Grail product
I then just used my L'Oreal blush sculpt
blusher and I absolutely love this out
of three shades complement each other
really well when you blend them together
it just leaves you as a gorgeous
natural-looking flush and I really like
the color of this against my skin tone
as I'm very light skinned so I really do
like this color
to bring back a bit of shininess into my
face even though my face does that
naturally within about an hour I just
decided to add some mary-lou manizer I
just add this on my cheekbones and my
Cupid's bow because I love how it looks
when the sunlight reflects on it I just
think he looks so gorgeous and makes my
makeup look a lot more professional for
my eyeshadow I decided to go quite
smokey today so I just took this light
brown shade from the Too Faced chocolate
bar palette and I just carefully blended
this in my outer corner this is quite a
nutmeg shade and it does look quite
orange toned but it is a lot more Brown
toned in real life it's just a quite a
light flush of color which is nice it's
a little bit natural but then it just
adds a bit of smokiness and then I just
added a darker brown color in my right
outer corner I love love love this shade
this is again from the Too Faced
chocolate bar palette and it just makes
everything look a bit more put together
and you can really see this color and it
is a lot more of a chocolatey Brown
compared to a nutmeg Brown I then just
added a mixture of the pink and gold
glitter eyeshadow in it the lid of my
eye and I just did this for both
eyeshadows
on top of the to shimmer eyeshadows I
then just added my Mac Rose pigment I've
never used this in a video before but I
absolutely love it is so so gorgeous and
I don't like to put too much on because
when you pack a lot on it is really
shimmery but as you can see it just
gives me a nice flush of rose gold
I then just took my Too Faced better
than sex mascara this is such a good
mascara and as I put on the slide back
there it makes your lashes thicker
blacker and longer is basically a triple
amazing mascara I just love this so much
this and the Maybelline lash sensational
is definitely my favorite mascara and
are insane when they're mixed together I
then finally just used my NYX lingerie
lipstick in the shade
I love this as it complements my
eyeshadow yes it is actually a dupe for
the Kylie Jenner lip kits I finally
managed to order a lip kits if you do
want to do or you want me to do a video
we're including it as I also got a gloss
as well I will either comment down below
so just go thumbs up that comment if you
do want me to do a video on my lip kit
it is then time for hair and as it's
spring and summer I like to do something
a bit different with my hair so as I
normally either have it straight or up
most of the time I like to curl it so I
just use the fabulous curling wand I
don't think this is any special one but
it just gets a bit smaller as you go
towards the end it was only around 15
pounds from Argos and I just hold my
hair on there for about eight to 10
seconds and it gives me this gorgeous
ringlet curl even though I don't really
have a tactic of doing this I don't do
it in sections I just kind of grab
random pieces and hope for the best
that is my tactic I find that it's the
best way to get kind of messy curls I
then just like to run my fingers through
the curls and just brush down then just
make them very big and messy and that is
my effortless waves done there's not
only takes around 10 to 15 minutes so
it's really not time-consuming and I
love love love the turnout so that was
the end of my get ready with me I really
hope you enjoyed it let me know if you
did by again giving this video a huge
thumbs up and let's see if we can smash
7,000 likes I love you all so much and I
will see you in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
