everyone so for today's video I'm going
to be doing a long awaited video is my
expectations vs. reality of being a girl
now I recently did a go struggles or
annoying things that happen to Girls
video and I think I did that about a
month ago and it went down so well you
guys absolutely loved it and I really
like filming funny videos so I thought
it would be nice to kind of do another
funny one it definitely isn't serious
that this video is not serious at all if
they're just over reactions of what
girls go through and what happens to
girls but yeah I really hope you enjoyed
this video if you did give it a huge
thumbs up and let's see if we can smash
10,000 likes because other one hit
10,000 likes and I hope you do the video
and let's get started
perfect
oh my god yes the kulluk it's gonna look
so cute on my Instagram you know what
it's so good if it was so good when you
have a Q Instagram
everybody literally has such cute
instagrams I don't even know what to do
in my life anymore
mine just looks like utter crap I've
taken some photos
everybody's going traveling doing stuff
exciting going on towers getting cute
sunsets and then there's me in my room
got mock exams but kinda bother to
revise oral exams and life is just great
so if I'm right I think rush at Han
about 50 60 pounds because I don't think
I spent anything on well really anything
I have already spent anything 40 quid on
McDonald's useful knowledge 10 politic
50 quid on Pizza Hut's are never going
to dress nice and then we're going to
look nice on Japan or money on food
perfect
carne Jenner lip this look has actually
saved my life and it was only 50 pounds
