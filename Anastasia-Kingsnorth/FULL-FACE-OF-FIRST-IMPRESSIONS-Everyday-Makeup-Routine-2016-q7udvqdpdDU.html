looking very done er and it is because
I've done a first impressions makeup
tutorial / everyday ish makeup routine
now of course I do not wear this lip
color on an everyday basis and this
matte eye shadow but I always get asked
like can I do a tutorial can I do a
makeup tutorial that's different to the
ones I used to do and I've been getting
a lot more comfortable with makeup
recently and I've been really
experimenting and finally I have all of
the new bits that I wanted to try so I
thought I would put together a video and
just do a huge first impression tutorial
with two lip options and then I've done
a burgundy smokey eye with makeup geek
moon dust so I'm absolutely loving it
I've used completely new perks that
you've never seen me use before - like
maybe one or two so yeah I really really
really hope you enjoyed this video if
you did make sure to give it a huge
thumbs up and let's get stuck so we are
starting off with the makeup geek X and
Manny
MUA palette now I am loving this palette
so I started off with the top middle
shade and it's kind of this this like
light brown shade I don't know it's so
nice literally it's the perfect autumn /
winter color so I just place this in at
my crease and blended it really softly
out I wanted to use tape so it will give
me a sharp edge but then quite soft
towards the top I then just took the
lighter brown which is next to it in the
palette and just blended that more
towards the inner corner of my eye to
give it kind of like an ombre look I
then took the burgundy shade which is I
think it's called Mars and I pop this in
the outer corner and blended this really
well I love this shade I was saying a
few videos back that I wanted a pure
burgundy shade and I cannot fold this it
is pure burgundy and there's absolutely
no fallout the pigmentation as you can
see is absolutely incredible and I love
it and then I just took the darkest
shade in the palette and pop it right in
the outer corner do
to make it look a bit more ombre when I
take the tape off so I do this on both
eyes and I'm just completely in love
with this palette I would 100% recommend
it I then went in with the Too Faced
glitter glue again this is the first
time I've used this from my purchase I
used it once in Paris with Luis and it
was amazing so I decided to pick it up
for myself and again I absolutely love
this it's just a base for glitter
because I love loose pigments so then I
went in with the makeup geek moon dust
and as you can see this is a gorgeous
pink holographic glitter it's so
gorgeous it kind of like blends in with
the ombre but it kind of stands out at
the same time so I literally love this
and as you can see it's just absolutely
gorgeous so once I put this on I just
ripped the tape off and that was my eyes
finished I love this I look I cannot
fault it and would definitely recommend
all three products I used next up we are
moving to Foundation so this is the Make
Up For Ever Ultra HD foundation now so
many people raved about this so I
decided to buy it from Sephora in Paris
and I'm not gonna lie to you guys it is
not my favorite foundation I much prefer
the L'Oreal True Match don't get me
wrong it's really good still but it's
really thick for my liking and I was
expecting it to give me more coverage
considering how thick it was as as you
can see at the moment my skin isn't the
best I mean it gave me a decent amount
of coverage I guess I just expected to
give me more for forty-year-olds but I
do love it I would just recommend other
foundations more than recommend this but
overall it is a nice foundation I then
went in with my collection lasting
perfection concealer I haven't bought on
your concealer recently because I always
stick to the same one so as you can see
I'm just putting it in all the normal
places on my face highlighting it and
then just blending it with my new Beauty
Blender which by the way is absolutely
amazing if you guys haven't tried the
real beauty blenders I would definitely
recommend it even though they're
slightly on the priority aside you can
really tell a difference between that
and a Jeep of one
then it is powered a time now I've had
this powder in my drawers for a long
long time but I haven't dug it out in a
while so this is a kind of first
impressions again I really like this
powder it's a really good drugstore
powder it's the l'oreal infallible as
you can see it mattifies my makeup look
pretty quickly and it has lasted me all
day so I do love this powder Urban Decay
then recently sent me the brand new
illuminated trio so I decided to try out
the blusher it's gorgeous it's so
natural and just kind of like a natural
flush of pink
it also has gorgeous shimmer undertone
so I would definitely recommend this
palette it's beautiful
whilst I was in Florida this summer I
decided to pick up the Becca X Jaclyn
hill champagne pop highlighter I love
this so much the only thing is it
doesn't stay on my face all day when I
put it on at first as you can see it's
so pigmented but it does wear off pretty
quickly maybe it's just because I'm not
putting enough on I'm not setting it
enough but overall it does last for a
good few hours and I do really like it
it doesn't last as long as I would have
hoped
I then went back in with my man EMU a
makeup geek palette and just dragged the
burgundy color underneath my eye this is
so pigmented I barely put my brush in
and it literally come out this pigmented
guys you seriously need to get this it's
amazing and then I just popped some
highlight in my inner corner as well
just to add a bit more to my eyeshadow
look I am then going in with mascara so
two-faced recently sent me a brand new
better than sex and because mine has
been run out for so long I haven't used
it in such a long time so I decided to
use it again and I forgot how much I
loved it it literally makes my eyelashes
look so long and natural and I didn't
even have to curl and then literally
just went straight up like this they
make them thick they make them black but
it doesn't look clumpy 100% recommend
this now at 4 lipsticks I decided to my
first one to go in with color pop Viper
I recently got a little color pop
lipsticks and guys my god are very
amazing these are the ultra matte ones
and as you can see they dry matte so
quick and literally I love this color so
much it complements the eyeshadow
perfectly they're literally matching
shades and I cannot explain to you how
much I love colour-pop lipsticks please
please please go and get them
then I went in with my Anastasia Beverly
Hills lipstick in potion now this is so
different to what I usually wear it's
purple and electric blue mixed together
but I was feeling it it's very good for
Halloween it has sadly already been and
gone
but I do like it for the wintertime but
I prefer the other one so that is the
end on my video I really hope you
enjoyed it let me know if you did by
giving it a huge thumbs up and let's see
if we can smash 10,000 lights if you
want me to do more of these this is kind
of my winter everyday makeup routine for
a weekend obviously I just changed up
the lip and sometimes I would like to
add false eyelashes but I don't have any
with me today but yeah I love you all so
much and I will see you in next week's
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
