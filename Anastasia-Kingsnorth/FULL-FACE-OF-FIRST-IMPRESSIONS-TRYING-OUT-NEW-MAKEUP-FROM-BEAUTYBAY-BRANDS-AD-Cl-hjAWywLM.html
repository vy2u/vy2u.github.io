going to doing a first impressions
makeup tutorial on this look here you're
thinking whoa Anna you've gone for the
black lip like what have you done like
I'm being bold and are being daring this
video is in a collaboration at with
Beauty Bay and recently they have done a
campaign all about being bold about
being brave and expressing your inner
self they've done a campaign called a
hashtag queen bee bee bee bee Santa
beautybay hashtag queen bee today do you
get it and they are encouraging people
to try more bold and daring makeup looks
there is five different looks that they
created within this campaign and I
created the look of drew I'll put a
picture on screen here so you guys can
see the looks I took inspiration from I
tried to get it as close as possible as
I said I couldn't get it exact but it
did use a black lip and that was like
it's pretty bold for me so this is the
finished tutorial it's kind of like a
half cut crease very nice winter smokey
eye if you do enjoy it remember to give
it a huge thumbs up and yeah let's just
get into the video I'm starting off this
makeup look trying at the Stila
one-step correcting serum and this is
the skin tone correcting and brightening
one I have really oily skin and a very
red skin so I really wanted to try
something that was kind of hopefully
gonna cut below that so it comes out
with a mixture of all the colors which
is quite nice so hopefully this is after
you gonna make it different under my
makeup I don't know if it's gonna make
an immediate difference or whether it's
just gonna help underneath my foundation
a few lives on your skin also I had my
brows already filled in I filled in with
the Anastasio beverly hills dipbrow
which i love now thats on and i guess
when it's blending in it's kind of
giving me a bit more of an immediate
coverage it feels really nice those
really soft quite sticky so hopefully
that means the foundation is gonna stick
full foundation I'm going to be trying
at the cover FX at natural finish
foundation now I don't know about you
I've heard so much about this I want to
try it for a long long time
mine is in at the shade n 30 I don't
know if this is going to be
too light or too dark I just kind of had
to guess so
fingers crossed this it's gonna be a
match and as well I don't know how much
you're going to need I've just gone to
squirts there and I'm just going to Wow
okay this is very very thick so I don't
know how much I'm going to need but this
is extremely thick normally I get along
well with kind of very chewy foundations
or artists thick so I don't know how I'm
gonna get on with blending this but it
should be okay it's just a very thick
pasty consistency also I know you're not
meant to put foundation on your eyelids
I just do this just to give it an even
coverage but I'm very very careful
around that area because obviously the
skins a lot thinner now we can go back
and add in more if we need to but we'll
just see how this blends first I mean
the coverage is pretty good I just think
I need a bit more on my skin so we're
just going to kind of add a bit more in
the areas I think I need it because I
have quite a few blemishes and spots at
the moment however it is blending really
nicely and it's blending into the color
that's perfect for my skin
I find it so hard to match my foundation
so I can push them for me please believe
me burn I've seen lots of reviews on
this foundation saying it does give
amazing coverage and I would 100% agree
I'm normally very say me say me I don't
really change up my foundations but this
looks like it might be making its way
into my everyday makeup routine because
this has given me such an even base I
mean it is a little bit too dark for my
neck area but I would blend it all the
way down here but I don't really want to
blend it all the way down but obviously
when I'm wearing other tops this will
look a lot better and hopefully when
I've powdered it it should look okay for
concealer we are gonna go in and try the
Milani
retouch and erase lights lifting
concealer I've also heard a lot about
this a big big fan of Milani products
I've got the Milani world that came out
fast
this isn't fair once it is the lightest
one that I could get but big fan of the
Milani two-in-one concealer foundation
so hopefully this is gonna be good got
quite my hopes for this we're going to
carry on with my
Real Techniques sponge but oh okay that
coverage is good that's a really nice
color I would have liked it to be a
little bit lighter got on my lip just
that well done
I'd like to have been a little bit
lighter just so it kind of pops my face
a little bit more highlights my areas
but nevertheless is actually quite a
good concealer it gives flawless
coverage which is obviously really good
this kind of flawless makeup look that
we're going for as you guys can see my
face just looks very even and very
blended it looks quite oily and liquidy
so we are gonna go in and set it I just
don't want you to end on the floor
where's it gone got it here is to set
this in place I'm so excited to try this
this is the beauty bakery better not
bitter flower setting powder the
packaging is amazing that she looks like
a flower bag and then you open it out
and you've got the powder in it just a
little transparent pot it says Beauty
bakery on top and it just says flower so
this is a c5 writing okay I need to peel
the sticker off oh my gosh I just spit I
just ate it I love that thank gosh I've
got dramas on but this is actually quite
a yellow toned powder we're just gonna
Pat this all in the areas like I said I
have extremely oily skin
okay so we will leave that on my face to
see how well that hold but the errors
I've put it on already it has mattified
a lot
now while this bakes and I've got the
huge yellow line down my nose we're
going to move on to my eyes but this is
gonna be a kind of inspired look by Drew
I don't think I'm going to create the
exact thing but this is going to be a
very much inspired look I'm going to
start off with a palette that looks
incredible and this is the morphe 35 P
as you can see here is there's so many
beautiful matte shades in it so that's
what we're going to start off by using
so let me just grab a brush and I'm
going to use maybe one of these shades
here just to blend it along the top of
my crease and just to kind of give me a
transition shade
I don't know how pigmented this is gonna
be so let's just pray okay that's quite
a nice shade actually I'm gonna darken
it up a little bit with a brownie shade
and we need to bring this quite high
because I'm gonna be bringing a glitter
shade up to the top of the crease
these are shadows as well blend
perfectly together but I expected that
because more fear shadows are incredible
I'm now just going to go and do the same
on the other eye I love these colors I
never normally wear kind of like
perfectly toned eyeshadows not really
doesn't really have any but looks like
this is probably gonna be my next go to
your eyeshadow Conoco really like it now
that's really faded and really blended
out I do to darken it up a little bit in
the outer crease I feel like the darkest
shade in this palette is probably gonna
be this one here don't want to darken it
up too much and go for a black so I
think we're just going to go for this
shade here and pop this in at the outer
corner yes I love that that's a really
nice berry shade now I need to get some
concealer and I'm just going to draw a
solid line from the inner corner about
half way up just so you can do a
beautiful cut crease using glitter and
for this I'm going to use again the
Milani retouch an erase concealer and
just a concealer brush bear with me this
might not work
I'm really hoping it does
now about if then I'm going to repeat it
on the other eye and then we will add at
CIMMYT glitter whilst I do the glyph
that I've zoomed in for you guys so as
you can see I have cut the crease just
halfway I didn't do it too high up
because I have a very big temptation of
doing that so I've just done it just
enough so you can see the clear line
where the glitter is going to be for
this I'm going to be using the color
drain queen-of-hearts palette and this
is absolutely stunning it's got some
beautiful beautiful glitter shades this
gold one here is amazing these three
beautiful and I love this purple shade
as well I am going to be using it the
gold shade your majesty and I'm going to
use a flat top brush because obviously
I'm not sure how printed it's going to
be yet but we're just gonna put quite a
lot of this in and then we're just gonna
outline at the crease line that I've
draw an Olympic lifter but it's not as
bright as I wanted it to be so I'm gonna
add some white first then we're gonna go
back in with the gold
now I've done that I'm gonna go back in
it with some of the glitter shades I'm
just going to blend this on the outer
corner lid this is a gorgeous brassy
copper shade and I wished it is more
pigmented or didn't really like blend in
with the purple as well because it but
it looks so pretty going along here I'm
just going to repeat that to the other
eye and then we're going to use another
palette to add a little bit more mister
because I love glitter
they glitter on Drew's look he's amazing
so I just want to make it pop a little
bit more and this time you try and eat
your skinny dip Ultra foiled shimmer
shadows palette and as you can see this
palette is just full of beautiful
shimmery eyeshadows we're going to go
over it with your shade skinny dip which
is kind of a cocky Goldy green I just
really like glitter so basically I want
to use as many glitter shades as I can
that is so beautifully shimmery and then
I'm gonna repeat it on the other side
this is so beautiful I actually cannot
deal
there we go that is eager to show you
added on how beautiful is that I
literally am obsessed I want to go back
in and darken the outer corner so I'm
going to be a bit brave and I'm going to
add the shade ladyship which is a purple
shade from the color drain at Queen of
Hearts palette because I think we need
to darken it up a little bit oh my gosh
that's amazingly beautiful that's like
the perfect dark purplish shade and
we're just going to go in and do the
same on the other eye I love this so
much but obviously no eye look is
complete without lashes and liner so I'm
gonna go away put my lashes on put my
eyeliner on then we will move it back on
it to me face here is the finished eye
look I am obsessed with this the lashes
that I used are from at Lily lashes I
will leave a link to them down below but
how incredible are these I'm a fully
obsessed with this eye shadow look I
have never really done anything like
this before but I love it the next thing
that we are going to try is more face
stuff so we're gonna go with the makeup
geek a bronze luster compact and this is
in the shade 20 I really do need to
brand my skin up a little bit more so
that's super pretty
so don't want to look like I've just
come from a chimney but oh that's really
really pretty and then we'll also pop
some on my forehead my temples just so
it adds a more color as we are lacking
definition in the face this is a super
super pretty bronzer I actually think
this is going to become one of my
favorites because it's blending so easy
it's a really nice shade as well it will
look really pretty for the winter time
just to kind of darken up any makeup
look we're going to go in with highlight
which is of course one of my favorite
things to do ever this is the jeffree
star cosmetics skin frost in Eclipse and
I love this because it's the mani MUA
collection so it's in black packaging
and it's absolutely massive so you get
so much product how do you open it here
we go oh my god how is stunning is that
and the mirror oh my gosh I'm living I'm
gonna grab another morphe brush because
morphe brush
my favorite and we're just gonna glow we
need to globe but as so much glow to
this makeup look honestly guys can you
see this obviously the more you build it
up the more blinding it's going to be
but this is so beautiful obviously
you've got to add some on the end of
your nose because what makeup look is
complete until you've got a little
glowing nose finally we're going to go
in with our lip color now I wanted to do
something really daring and drew
actually had a black lip so I'm gonna
try a black lip obviously I probably
wouldn't wear a black lip every single
day out I would wear out on a night
though
so I'm going to be daring I'm gonna try
a black lips but if you do wear recreate
this makeup look obviously you can wear
whatever lip color you wish I also think
it would look really nice with a
burgundy lip I'm going to be using at
the LA flash lip couture waterproof
liquid lipstick and this is in the shade
venom this is the darkest lip color I
ever go into her near the pressure
putting this on right now because I do
not want to get it anywhere on my skin
because then she I would not be able to
recover that so here is the finished
makeup look the black lip actually went
on which I was like yes give me a high
five everybody didn't smudge it didn't
get it anywhere didn't even get it on my
teeth so I've done pretty well to get
that on but I love this it's proper
daring for me it's proper vampy but I
really like it for the winter like I
would go out like this I lift you a car
like this and be bold and daring and
just do it I really hope you guys
enjoyed this video if you did remember
to give it a huge thumbs up and let me
know if you were going to recreate any
of the look that I've created today if
you do tag me on instagram tweet me I
would love to see but yeah other than
that I really hope you guys enjoyed and
I will see you on Sunday at 10 a.m. with
a brand new video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
