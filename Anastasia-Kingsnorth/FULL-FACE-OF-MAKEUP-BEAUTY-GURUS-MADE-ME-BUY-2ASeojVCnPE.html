so for today's video I'm back with a
makeup tutorial and I am feeling it
today I'm going to be doing a full face
of products that beauty gurus made me
buy all of the makeup I've got on my
face today was recommended to me by your
fellow beauty gurus on YouTube not
personally just like in their videos
I've watched you know so many items of
makeup are spoken about on YouTube and
there's just some better than others
something I wanted to put to the test
sounds exactly what I've done today I
created a bit of a different look I look
like I don't usually go for but I do
really like it just using the products
that are always always spoken about I
really hope you guys enjoyed this video
if you do remember to smash a huge
thumbs up and other than that let's just
get started jumping straight on in into
this makeup tutorial I have primed
moisturized at my face person lip balm
on all my face is ready to go so like I
said today we are going to be testing
out all of the products that I have a
purchased because beauty gurus and
youtubers have recommended them to me
there's obviously a lot of makeup
products that I feel like people buy now
purely because youtubers said that
they're really good so I thought I would
put a lot of the products to the test to
see what they are actually really good
I've used a lot of them but not for a
while so it's kind of bringing them back
and just testing if I still like them
for foundation I'm gonna go straight in
with the Milani conceal and perfect
two-in-one a foundation and a concealer
now I haven't used this in a long time
but I do remember the one thing I didn't
like about it was the fact that this is
new lighter shade it's 0-1 and it is
actually still a bit dark for me as you
can see I'm extremely pale so this isn't
going to go down to - well hopefully
once I have other products on my face
then it shouldn't be too bad but another
thing about this foundation is as well
that it's super super thick so I kind of
need quite a lot to blend it across my
face and it doesn't spread as easy
because my face is a little bit dry at
the moment despite the fact that have
moisturized the color much isn't perfect
but I just want to say again this is a
lighter shade there's no way I could
have got a lighter shade so if anybody
wants
anything about the shade please don't
because I am aware that it is probably
too dark but this is the lighter shade
so I'm just gonna take my tamp with
Beauty Blender and I'm gonna begin to
blend this into my skin I remember it
being quite good coverage and I remember
seeing nikkietutorials and sofas nails
talked about this and that's the reason
I bought it so like as well because it's
quite thick I don't actually get on with
it but if you like really thick
foundations then this one is definitely
gonna be for you because this is a
really thick foundation like when I put
it on my skin it doesn't drip down
whereas some other products like the
L'Oreal True Match and products like
that which are actually my favorite
foundation to kind of drip a bit more
and because of the texture of my skin
they just tend to blend a bit easier now
that is all blended I actually do love
this foundation once it's really blended
in it the only thing I have to say about
it is the lightest shade still isn't
light enough for me so for me I would
like this to bring out a lighter shade
then right off since I have bought this
shade but it's not a bad foundation I
mean it's really good coverage and once
I blended it down my neck it doesn't
look too bad I guess
for concealer we're gonna go in with one
that I am absolutely loving again and I
did buy this because of YouTube as so
many people were raving on about it and
it is the Maybelline instant anti age
rewind eraser I remember being so
excited to try this because it comes out
of the little sponge and I haven't used
this in a while so it might take some
time for it to come out ah there we go
yeah this is so creamy and look at that
color against this you know what I
actually think having this bit of a
darker foundation might help the
concealer to pop a bit more if I really
like this concealer you know I'm not
gonna go buy another one because it's
kind of running out so I used it so much
back in the day when I first bought it
but oh my god I actually remember how
much I loved this now eight pounds to
buy from the drugstore and it's such a
good coverage you know it's actually
evening out the colour of my foundation
now I feel like foundation is genuinely
just my base layer like I build so much
on top of it that in the end it doesn't
well obviously it matters because it's
like the building block so you make up
but I feel I can see that actually makes
more of a difference to my skin than
foundation so everybody who knows all
about this concealer you were so right
I'm addicted to that so so far that's
the like
two products but 100% like go and buy
this if you haven't tried already next
we are going to bake so I'm going to be
using something from a brand that a lot
of people are talking about at the
moment and it is the beauty bakery flour
powder now this is a loose setting
powder it is a little bit tinted it into
the word I don't know it's meant to be
like a burner on a powder so I'm gonna
take another Beauty Blender and I'm just
gonna pop that in the powder and I'm not
gonna leave this on it for too long
because it tends to leave me with a bit
of a yellow tone on my skin like that's
not just this powder that's any powder
we're just gonna set that down my nose
I'm gonna put it on my chin my chin
tends to lose makeup first like around
the bottom area so I do have to set that
quite a lot I'm gonna leave this to set
I'm gonna go away and I'm gonna do my
eyebrows using the anastasia beverly
hills dipbrow pomade now I am gonna say
one thing this is quite light for me now
because I did turn my hair I like
weights been like this for a while I
know but I'm just using the end of this
pot so it is a little bit light for me
and I'm gonna use a darker shade as soon
as it has ran out but this was such a
rage about products I never gave into it
I always had it in my drawer and I was
like no Anna it's not as good as
everybody saying it is but honestly like
once you get deeper into the pot I'm
gonna go away put my eyebrows on and
then will brush away the powder and see
what the base looks like brows are now
all on and my god don't brows makes such
a difference I'm going to brush all over
the powder off and I blend it in to my
skin I really like it actually like I
can see why people are raving all about
this brand it's not too cheap I think
it's like 20 pounds than this powder
another alternative jute which I hear a
lot of people talk about as well it's
the Rimmel match perfection loose powder
that I spent to be my face does feel
mattified down it doesn't feel too matte
though to the point that I'm gonna go
really cakey and dry now we're gonna go
in with a bit of contour and like
realistically
this bronze a raved about across the
whole social media whole social media
war and a whole social media platform
and this is the benefit hoola bronzer I
love this isn't my favorite runs as ever
but I never use it anymore and I don't
know why so I'm gonna use this Real
Techniques cheek brush even though
didn't contour and I'm just gonna pop
this on I don't
like pigmented it is on the first try
yes I know it's not too much and it's
such a good color for me this is blended
insane like I didn't put it on my skin
and it just stained it in one place look
it's blended just so beautifully this is
100% one of my Holy Grail products and
I'm actually like wondering why I
stopped using this because it's so good
benefit babes you are killing it I felt
like it doesn't make me look ashy either
it kind of a gentleman you just bringing
back color into my face I then just like
to run over my contour again a with the
hoola but with a different brush and
this is there more fee for and I feel
like this just blend it a little bit
more as the final color and you know
just gets away any like chalky bit so
that other brush didn't do I love it so
now I'm going to go in it with blush and
another blush that was very raved about
I'm gonna say a few years ago because I
don't really hear people talk about it
anymore but it was really talked about
and this is the NARS orgasm blush this
is the only nos product I own and it
genuinely was because youtuber spoke
about it so I'm going to use this brush
from Real Techniques this is just a
blush brush and pop this on my cheeks
it's such a natural flush Joop is the
sleek rose gold from the drugstore
I've definitely spoke about that in a
lot of previous videos but I wanted to
use products that I know youtubers have
spoke about a lot but the sleek rose
gold is insane and I'd like a hundred
percent recommend that it's like four
pounds it is quite pink and rosy at the
start but I like to put quite a bit on
because then it will kind of blend away
if you know what I mean now I think it's
time at force and I look now I'm not
gonna lie I'm gonna try it every
different looks like actually never
tried before today and I'm gonna try a
darker color all across my lid I've
never done this
it might completely fail and I might
look horrendous but but quite a lot of
glitter on make it quite smoky so let's
try it for my eyes look today I'm going
to be using at the morphe at certified
at t palette now morphe pilots are again
very very spoken about on youtube and
personally if it wasn't for youtubers
speaking about them I probably wouldn't
know
what they are just because I wouldn't
have seen them and I see you have to buy
them online and stuff I'm first of all
gonna go in with a bit of a matte brown
shade so maybe this shade here and this
shade here and just blend that all
across the top of my crease making it
very smoky and very blended this is dois
that's pigmented I was gonna say this is
just gonna be a base color but I
underestimated the pigment of these and
I'm just gonna repeat that on the other
eye definitely not using as much shadow
as I did on the previous eye because I
did not know how pigmented they were as
well more people palettes are literally
like 20 to 25 pounds and you get 35
eyeshadows in it like it's in saying
this such good quality I'm actually
gonna take those same two colors and
bring them down onto my lid and then I'm
gonna take a darker smoky color and
blend that in my crease and then right
outer corner I'm just taking a bit of a
darker Brown because I feel like I
should go darker with it you know we're
going in today regarding today and then
just doing this on the other eye I'm
just gonna make sure all the lid is
covered and then it's quite dark so this
is what we're going with
so far it's still not really as dark as
I want it to be but I'm literally using
the darkest shades in this palette
although that's kind of made it a little
bit darker so we're getting there I
think it just takes quite a lot of
building with the dark colors I think
that's a star cuz I'm gonna go I don't
want to go like really dark to the point
here looks kind of weird on me I'm now
gonna take a bit more of a a very color
so we've got a few in here we've got
this shade here and we've got this shade
here and I'm gonna blend that in it be
crease trying to make it very defined
and not too big and blend it out I want
to make it very dark and very prominent
I'm just gonna carefully bring that
along the crease it doesn't matter too
much by going a weird here because I am
gonna cut it off with eyeliner so
doesn't know if it goes really smoky as
you can see the color is really building
up now and that looks super smoky and
the brown is really contrasting against
it I really really like it I'm just
gonna go away and do the exact same on
the other eye and then I will be back to
kind of give it a bit more definition
and we're gonna add some glitter because
I can't just go with an all matte dark
look it's not me now we've got that look
on at both eyes I need to make the
middle of my eye pop before we add some
glitter
I'm gonna go in
with these two very pigmented gold
shades and just really pack that on in
the lid I've got a GWA flat head brush
here and I'm really gonna pack this on
because I really want the glitter to
stand out so hopefully ah oh my god
that's like I'm don't get me wrong I
knew it was gonna be pretty but that's
so much prettier than I thought it's got
such a foiled effect that it looks so
pretty
oh my god I just can't get over how
pigmented this is for glitter right I'm
gonna be using the LA splash a little
color gold balls and I get these off of
Beauty Bay and I can't remember who I
saw talk about these but oh my god it
just went everywhere I remember loving
them to pieces and I haven't used a
splitter at such a long time that I know
I just need to use it again you know
bring it back so that's what I'm gonna
do and I'm just gonna pop it on top of
the gold and the gold is really gonna
help that pop I'm just using some of the
two-faced at glitter glue and I'm just
gonna pop that on top of the gold these
glitters are literally like 11 pounds as
well and they're so pretty as you can
see now looks super super pretty so I'm
just gonna repeat that on the other eye
then I will come back and I'm going to
darken the eye up just to make it look a
bit more you know what I want to do now
is add some lashes I'm actually gonna
skip higher on I feel like the glitter
and the dark highs just enough so I'm
gonna go in with these lashes here from
GWA and then I have got some of this
gorgeous thick and chunky white glitter
and I'm gonna blend the burgundy under
my eye and then put the white glitter on
top of the gold and I thought that's
really gonna make it pop especially
because there's no eyeliner I feel like
that I was just gonna look a lot bigger
especially because they're very dark
with a pop of color in the middle as you
can see all of my eyes are now pretty
much done I've dragged it under I put
lashes on I really really like it but
there's one finishing touch so we need
the gypsy shrine glitter because this
can't make it pop oh my god no I forgot
this one thing I want to do before
another raindrop product but I'm talking
like years ago was the NYX jumbo eye
pencil in milk I used her love of this
as well and I'm actually gonna line my
water I thought this is gonna make my
eyes pop so much more as why they get
into the white and basically I just
haven't done it in years and they really
want to do it again I don't know how men
to hold a mirror and doing this at the
same time like how do people have these
skills I feel like I'm gonna have to
hold the mirror between my knee or
something okay let's hack together that
marriage to dirty so let's try this one
although that has been what I pop so
much more so the efforts worth it guys
okay oh my gosh that was weirdly hard
that's really made the eyelet come
together so is all worth it now I'm just
gonna take a little bit more glitter
glue but only a tiny bit because I don't
want to put too much a white glitter on
at all as I don't want it to take the
attention away from the gold and then
I'm just gonna pop my brush in there oh
it's actually not make that much of a
difference bail I thought it was gonna
be way more bright than it actually is
it's kind of just added a bit more like
a holographic feel ya know and then I'm
just gonna do it to the otherwise well
even though this really didn't make that
much of a difference so for my kind of
just wasted five minutes but I do really
like the glitter on its own I just think
because the colors are really dark
underneath its not sure well I really
really like it so different - I usually
do and I do really like it so now we
need to highlight this face I add some
lipstick
just to bring the whole look together
and then I think we're pretty much done
for highlight we're gonna go with an
absolute classic but I don't know how
I'm gonna show you the actual
highlighter because it's so smashed the
only bad thing about this back of
champagne pop is that it smashes almost
instantly but this is the Jaclyn hill
champagne pop highlighter and I love it
like I love it it's just smashed into
absolute smithereens I remember I bought
this in America in Sephora and it
literally smashed before I got home I
was like but it's a really good
highlighter as you can see so it's all
good you make doom we used it smash I
just feel like highlighter really brings
my look together for like without it it
wouldn't look as good do you know what I
mean especially highlighter on my nose
I'm obsessed probably put way too much
on my nose but now that that's all
blended I'm going to go in with my lip
color and this is probably one of the
most if not the most raved about lip
color on YouTube and this is a max
velvet teddy I remember it used to be so
hard
get ahold of this lipstick and then
suddenly because the kind of rave has
gone down a bit more it's not as hard to
get hold of but I thought this is really
gonna complement the eyes and basically
I just love this I just barely use it
anymore
the only thing is I always use liquid
lipsticks now so I find it so hard to
actually apply my lipstick using a
lipstick if that makes sense I don't
know it's what it really hard and here
is the finished makeup look I really
really like it I think it's something
very different and I think it does
showcase that you can get really good
makeup products that youtubers recommend
I honestly love all of these products so
much and especially the eyes like I
don't know what it is about the eyes
today but I'm just really really liking
it so here is the finished look I really
hope you guys enjoy it if you did
remember to smash a huge thumbs up I
love you all so so so much and I will
see you on its Sunday at 10 a.m. for a
brand new video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
