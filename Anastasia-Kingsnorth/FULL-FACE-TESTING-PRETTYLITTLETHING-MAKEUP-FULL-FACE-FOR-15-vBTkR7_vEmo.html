today's video as you can see I'm pretty
much bare face and my hair is back which
means we're doing a testing video today
I am going to be putting a pretty little
thing makeup to the test and this has
been so requested on my channel
everybody hasn't wanted me to do this as
I'm a sucker for pretty little thing
clothes so I thought I want to try their
makeup I have got some of their brushes
and a two of their palettes to try out
for you guys today so I really hope you
guys enjoyed if you do please smash it a
huge thumbs up and let's get into the
video first of all I know look at my
hair looks quite cute actually I feel
like I look really young and this is how
I had my hair for Coachella day 1 but I
do really like it I've just like Dutch
braid the top I don't know I thought it
looked quite cute I've also got on at my
base makeup already so I've got on at my
teeth primer foundation concealer and
powder and brows because pre-digital
thing don't actually do that make up yet
so test out for you guys I've got their
contour highlight blush eye shadow and
lip products because they don't do any
base product yet I'm just going to get
right into it because I'm very excited
but I have to realize I don't have a
contour brush so two seconds so to start
off this video I am going to be testing
this palette here which is the pretty
little thing get cheeky face compact kit
and it comes with two bronto's a blusher
and a highlight now this was only ten
pounds I want to see I was 10 pounds
it's got this holographic packaging and
it's got the unicorns on it and then it
says pretty little thing in the middle
this is very similar to the Anastasia
Beverly Hills moon child packaging it's
holographic and the shape is very
similar to a lot of the Anastasia
highlight palettes as well but I really
really like it I think it looks really
pretty
it doesn't necessarily feel cheap I
think it would scratch it very easily
but it doesn't feel cheap and then when
you open it up inside you have a mirror
which is something that a lot of
highlighted palettes don't have and it
is something that I really really like
about this palette because if you don't
we do have all my makeup in this mirror
and then we've got the product here so
I'm just gonna lift the plastic film off
oh it's takedown there we go oh my god
I've just kind of scratched them all so
we've got two bronzers here this one is
a little bit darker than this one we've
got a highlight and a blush so I think
I'm going to try
first of all this bronzer and then
obviously if it's not dark enough then
we can go in with this one but by the
looks of it the pans are very big
especially for the bronzers and they
look quite deep as well if they're as
deep as this palate that's really good
value so I'm going to be taking my
morphe full brush which is my usual
contour brush because I didn't actually
get any of the face brushes from pretty
little thing I didn't know how good they
were gonna be so I decided to get their
eye brushes instead so I'm just going to
use this but it is clean so we've got no
products on it at all so I'm just gonna
dab it in a - this contour here there's
a lot of fallout I don't know if you
guys can see that but it's kind of just
spread along the palate and when I dab
that yeah it kind of like flings off
it's pigmented first impression it's
actually not that bad it's blending
really nicely and it's a really nice
color but I feel like it looks quite
chalky on my skin maybe I need to keep
on blending in it just to see what it
looks like but to efface actually quite
a nice color it's going a little bit
patchy in some areas I thought like it's
one of those products that as soon as
you put it onto your skin you need to
blend it straight away ice it will stick
I felt like it's that type of contour
but it's a really really nice color and
then it's gonna go in on at my forehead
actually I really really like this the
only thing I'm struggling a little bit
is with blending it up into my hairline
it's blending on my skin fine but get
into the hairline a little bit
struggling with as you can see it needs
a lot of blending with a different brush
as well because here it's all kind of
patched together I didn't actually put
that much on but it's all patched
together so I need to get a clean brush
that hasn't got any product on and I
need to just blend it completely out now
I've gone over with a complete cream
brush it doesn't look nowhere near as
bad I've blended it out I think that's
what it needed it needed a lot of
blending out because it is so pigmented
that a lot of it kind of spreads very
easily I just had a look in the Sun and
it actually does look really really nice
it just looks like I'm really bronzed
like it doesn't like a natural bronze it
looks like a really bronze but I'm kind
of feeling that especially if I was
doing like a full night glam type of
look I actually think that it does look
really really pretty we are now going to
go in with the blush shade here and I'm
just gonna down my brush into it go
about anything it's gonna be quite
pigmented so I'm not gonna put too much
on my brush and then just dab it onto my
cheek
again this is a really nice color just a
really pretty natural flush it does have
shimmer to it and if I had choice I'd
probably choose a matte blush just
because I do like to add shimmer just
with highlight but it's a really nice
color and that's just added a nice
little flush back to my cheeks now
finally I'm gonna go in with the
highlighter shade again I'm hoping this
is gonna be as pigmented the only thing
I want to say is it does have a lot of
fallout this palette but it's nothing
that can't be coped with oh girl that
highlight is good that's good because
I'm so fair this is such a nice white
toned highlight like if it was gold
tonal yellow tone it would not suit my
skin but wow this highlight is blinding
like I'm only dabbing it on my skin as
well if I've really built this up we
could we could be like glowing I'm gonna
add it to the end of my nose because oh
my gosh unit one look and it looks good
already that highlight is probably one
of the best highlighters I've ever tried
in my life and I really wish they
offered it in a more shade because this
palette only comes in one shade if I
couldn't pick like medium or dark so if
they could release a highlighter palette
if they don't actually I think they do
have a highlighter palette already
actually so I take that back because the
highlighters are amazing and I wish I
had more I actually think I'm gonna
order some more so that is the base of
my makeup done I'm really really happy
with it I think it looks really pretty I
think it looks quite natural and
fluttery
so now I'm gonna go in with this a big
palette here which I'm very excited for
and this is called the full works
ultimate two-faced palette now this
actually does include a bronze blush and
highlight but I wanted to just buy a
separate palette but this blush in here
is actually matte and the highlight is
actually gold toned and this also
includes 40 different eyeshadows and a
load of lip glosses how many lip glosses
we've got we've got 20 lip glosses so
these are other eyeshadows here and
these are all be lip glosses as you can
see it's just a massive book of makeup
these are retails out of 15 pounds and
if it's anything to go by the
pigmentation of those I think this is
gonna be really good you've also got
some brushes here you've got the flat
tended padded brushes and some lip
brushes but personally I'm not going to
use those I actually really think that
they can ruin the quality of the product
so I'd much rather use my brushes and
the pretty little thing product so we'll
go to this side in a minute but we're
first of all going to go to the
eyeshadow side and do my eyes now first
impressions the colors are quite miss
matchy and a lot of them are brown
you've got your greens there's some
Purple's some yellows but the majority
of them are either matte brown or gold
shimmer and I didn't really want to do a
matte brown and gold so I'm thinking
we're gonna do a matte brown and yellow
I've never done yellow eyeshadow before
so this is gonna be a first but I'm
thinking let's do a yellow halo eye with
brown I mean it might look disgusting
but then it could look really good and
you know we're not necessarily creating
a let's go out in the den go shopping
look we could be creating a full glam
look or just playing with makeup look so
I'm not saying this is necessarily a
look I'd wear out it's just something
I'm gonna try and recreate so I'm going
to use this yellow here I'll probably
end up using this gold this peach these
Browns here but yeah it looks really
good on first impressions I'm just gonna
grab the mirror out from the contour
palette and use this to do my makeup
with so I've got three different Real
Techniques eyeshadow brushes here these
are my favourite eyeshadow brushes so I
think I'm just gonna take this one here
which is the medium a shadow and brush
and first of all I'm gonna go in it with
the yellow and use this as a face shade
and just pack this all on my lid okay so
I put the yellow on and you can't
actually see it yeah I think you need to
build this color up quite a lot before
you're able to see it the colors coming
through more now it's kind of got a bit
oranjee maybe that's because of some of
the residue on the brush I don't know
but the color is coming through and it
does actually look really really pretty
the only thing is it is a full shimmer
shade it's not matte at all and this
shade preferably would have been Matt
for the look that I'm doing but oh well
that's fine I've never worn yellow
eyeshadow in my life so I really don't
know what to expect with this look
that's the other one I don't actually
know how well you guys can see it but
the yellow is on I can see it in real
life
and it looks really good now I'm gonna
go in with a brown shade but I don't
want to go in at too dark so I'm
thinking I'm gonna go in with this shade
and then we can just slowly and surely
build it up Matt Shaye's tend to be more
pigmented than shimmer shades anyway so
maybe this will be more pigmented that
darker Brown is so much better it's not
as dark as it looks in the palette which
I'm quite grateful for at the moment
because if it was I think it would kind
of
look but I'm just going to blend this
all along not covering the yellow but
going of right in my inner corner right
to my outer corner I can't really blend
it into the yellow that well like it's
got quite a harsh line as you guys can
see I'm adding at the brown on and there
is a bit of a harsh line between the
brown and the yellow and the yellow kind
of has disappeared so I think I'm gonna
have to go in and add more because I
really want the yellow to be seen I
don't want this to be another brown or
eye shadow look but the brown is really
pigmented but the yellows not as
pigmented now I put the brown on top of
it now I'm going to take the darkest
Brown in the palette which actually is
that the one I've already been using now
I'm gonna take the same brown but pack
this in to the inner corner and at the
outer corner leaving a gap in the middle
where I can add the yellow and the gold
these eyeshadows do have quite a bit of
Fallout but luckily it does kind of just
brush away it's not too hard to get rid
of all the fallout is brushed away and
it actually does look ok so I'm gonna go
back in with the yellow shade and try
and pack this as much as physically
possible in the middle of my eye I've
done that and as you can see it doesn't
really look yellow it looks more peach
but at least I've actually managed to
add the color on top of the brown which
I really didn't think I'd be able to do
I'm just gonna carry on building that up
adding the yellow on top to make it as
pigmented as I possibly can I'm then
just gonna take the smallest brush and
I'm gonna try and add a typical later
shade so there's several different
little shades in this palette there's a
really nice Goldy bronze one which I
think is the one I'm gonna go for this
one in the corner up here and then I'm
gonna mix it with this really light
pretty gold so we're having a women
issue because the colors just aren't
really blending that well I'm gonna go
away I'm gonna blend them a little bit
more put some lashes on and see what I
can do to say there but it's just really
hard because the darker colors are a lot
more pigmented than the lighter color so
I'm honestly gonna see what I can do to
save this and then I can talk you guys
through it but at the moment there's not
much I can do because the colors are so
pastel and they're not so vibrant but
that's a little bad thing at all but
they're just very pastel and not as
vibrant as I thought they were gonna be
I have figured out a way to fix it I've
done it on this eye here I've decided to
add it concealer and then that fixes it
perfectly because honestly it just
looked too messy so as you can see I've
done it lashes I've done liner and now
going to show you how I did things with
the concealer all I did was take my
collection concealer and I've got my
brush here get a little bit on your
brush and then in the middle of your eye
just dab it on and then I look up and
that creates the line for me so I can
follow my natural line and then all
you're gonna do is take a flat brush and
you're just gonna follow that line
around in the middle and I'm just gonna
blend it once you've done that you just
want to take the brush with the brown
eyeshadow on and then just dab it either
side just so it blends a little bit over
the concealer but you've still got the
whole oh I going on and then there you
go as simple as that I've done it myself
a mini halo I know I was gonna put
eyeshadow on top of the concealer but I
don't really want to risk it going wrong
again
so actually I'm not gonna lie if you can
do a little technique quite adding
concealer or adding glitter on top of
the eyeshadows the eyeshadows are really
good but if you were gonna use them
alone I personally wouldn't try and do
any abstract or kind of really in detail
looks I feel like they're more eye
shadow so if you're doing a very basic
look the actual eye shadows are great
it's just I don't think the colors blend
very well and I think you're gonna have
to do quite basic looks so if you're
looking for a basic starting out palette
I think that's the palette now it is
time at for lips so I don't really know
what lip color to go for I'm just gonna
rip the plastic off at this part the
palate as well and we've got 20
different lip colors here to go for
they're all lip glosses and I never use
lip glosses so I have no idea what to
expect
alright don't know if that just hit the
lens or if that just hit the screen but
okay my lip brush is gone I've just
realized before we go into lips I just
want to add some eyeshadow underneath my
eye so I'm just gonna quickly take that
Brown and I'm just gonna drag it on the
outer corner underneath my eye before I
add some mascara just to blend the
lashes in and then I'm just gonna blend
up my lashes in it with the mascara
really quickly just so they look a more
big and more bold and then ask them
bottom lash mascara back to the lip
palette now I think I'm gonna go for the
nudist color in here oh no actually that
colors really really nice I'm gonna go
with this color here I don't know I've
never really applied like flat packaged
lipgloss before is that even
panic glass I don't know the colors all
kind of like mixing together the same
for me like they're not really that
pigmented they're really smoothing
velocity when you get them on your brush
or when you put them onto your lips they
don't really spread that well the brown
color it looks more pink but this is a
car I'm gonna go for because this is the
most pigmented but I just never really
been a fan of this type of lip gloss
anyway I'm much prefer matte lip so
everybody this is it the finished look
overall I mean I'm not gonna say it's
one of the nicest makeup looks I've ever
done because personally I'm not a
massive fan of the colors that I picked
out but at the same time it really
doesn't look awful and I feel like the
base makeup like the contour the bluffs
a highlight that was amazing I really
really love that the lips I'm not too
sure I just prefer personally normal it
glosses and normal lipsticks that just
makes it easier for me and I don't know
why I feel like the concealer actually
saved it I feel like if we didn't have
the concealer it would look very messy
and it would look nowhere near as good
but I'm not gonna slate the product
though because I feel like it's a really
good palette to have if you're starting
out on makeup and you're on a bit of a
budget because the 15 pounds for all of
this is amazing and obviously this was
10 pounds but you get it all in this
little book here so realistically for 15
pounds I really don't think I've created
a bad makeup look I'm not actually gonna
give this a hit but as I said it's not
all about like the vibrancy this palette
it's more about the neutrals and the
pastel colors so that's the type of
thing you're going for that palette is
amazing so I really hope you guys have
enjoyed it watching if you did please
smash a huge thumbs up let me know down
below in the comments of what you
thought of this makeup and if you tried
any of it out I did also have some of
the eye shadow brushes here which I
actually forgot about there's a really
like a flat-headed when there's an
angled one so I'll probably do these in
another first impressions tutorial I
just got carried away with my makeup
brushes and then I kind of forgot I have
them let's see if we can smash 10,000
lights on this video and I would do
another Tesla make a video of your
guys's a choice but other than that I
love you all so much and I will see you
on a Sunday at 10 a.m. for a brand new
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
