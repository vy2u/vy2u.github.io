channel or so for today's video as you
can see I'm not really wearing my usual
makeup I actually decided to do a video
today where I am going to be using my
mum's makeup and I did a full face of
one of her makeup looks using her makeup
obviously the shades are different the
brows are different the lips the
difference the eyes are different
everything is different but I just
thought this would be a really good
video so I hope you guys enjoy if you do
remember just about a huge thumbs up and
other than that let's just get started
this isn't my mum's little makeup
station she has got a caddy full of
makeup here then she's got some perfumes
and then it needs to be draw she's also
got more makeup but this is what she
takes into the bathroom every day with
her to do her makeup so I am gonna use
all the makeup in here as you can see
she's actually got quite a lot of really
good makeup so the only thing I think
we're gonna struggle with is the
foundation shades and concealer shade
everything else we should be okay with
although I'm not going to use her
brushes she has requested that I use my
own so yes mum I will use my own brushes
but let's give it a go this is way too
heavy it's in my room we are ready to go
so happy that she's called back out bang
I'm not gonna lie just not browsing I
think we're gonna struggle with brows
actually as well but it's got a lot of
lipstick choice so you know what I think
we actually might be able to create
quite a good makeup look we are about to
start off with the first step and you'll
probably notice that a lot of my
mother's makeup this stuff that I used
to have in my collection when I've kind
of finished with it and I'm not really
wanting to use it anymore then mum will
actually have it off of me but she does
have a lot of makeup as others she's
bought in here so if you think you've
seen two other products before that it
probably because I've given them to her
for prime now we are going in with the
Stila
one-step color corrector primer and I
gave them on this because I didn't get
the use out of it that I wanted to
although it's an amazing primer and
actually I kind of regret giving it away
now because I remember how good it is my
skin is still quite red and it does have
a lot of scarring so a primer like this
does help and it's kind of correcting so
it just covers all of my redness and
ready for the foundation well though it
doesn't even look like my mum as you use
this so for foundation and we are going
in it with the Rimmel London a lasting
finish 25 our comfort serum now I know
this is a really good foundation I know
that already but this is in the shade
200 soft beige as my mum is a lot darker
than me
so I really don't know how this is going
to go I'm just gonna have to pump it
onto my skin I'm gonna put quite a lot
on because because of the weather at the
moment my skin is really dry so I've had
to put a lot of moisturizer I mean I'm
gonna have to put quite a bit of
foundation on as okay it kind of goes
really patchy on my skin really easily
this foundation feels quite thick but it
feels quite moisturizing as well and I'm
gonna have to blend this down my neck as
you can see as I have extremely pale and
my mum just loves the tanned look I just
looked at myself in the mirror and
realized how stupid I look so lets blend
this in and I know I'm gonna look so
orange I tend to look orange in every
foundation just because of my skin shade
but this is gonna make me so patchy
there's no way I'm gonna be able to
cover all this it's just gonna have to
look patchy guys I'm really sorry we're
just gonna have to go with the patchy
look embrace it today I probably should
have dampened my Beauty Blender a bit
before blending this because my Beauty
Blender is quite dry at the moment but
it really helping with the shade and the
consistency of the foundation especially
because my mum's concealer is also very
dark although I do like the texture of
the foundation like it's blending a lot
better than I think that some of the
other Rimmel ones are and I do really
like it and if it is more shade I
actually think I would use this on
pretty much everyday basics for
concealer my mama uses the collection
last infection just like me so no
disgust scene is a really good formula
however my mother is in the shade
core medium too and I normally use the
lighter shade so this isn't going to do
me any favors in the shade range
department either I love the consistency
of this concealer I always rave on about
it this is a little bit too dark for me
and then we're just going to go in and
we're gonna blend the concealer I've
said this in a lot of videos I actually
thought that the concealer gives me
better coverage than the foundation
sometimes and actually that color range
isn't that bad like it's not that bad on
me at all and it's actually blended
quite nicely with the foundation so even
though the foundation was a little bit
darker and a little bit of setback the
concealers that kind of brought it back
and made my skin look a bit more dewy a
bit more vibrant which is desperately
what I needed now we need to mattify my
skin down a little bit even though it's
very dry just because I do feel really
really Jimmy and my mum has at the
Rimmel stay matte powder I normally use
the translucent one but my mum has at
0:05 it's silky a beige so she's even
going in with the powder in a darker
shade let's just swirl my brush around
in this all I really don't this is
gonna make much of a difference to the
color of my skin I feel like it is
genuinely just going to mattify it down
I'm not gonna lie I love this powder so
if you don't have it already
it's actually for pound you do need to
invest in it because it's so good just
having a look at my skin like obviously
it's going to appear different on camera
and I can't see what you guys are seeing
but I don't think it looks that bad and
I feel like I actually suit the color
once it's blended and once I've kind of
got everything else on it like obviously
next been patching we're just gonna get
past that you know we're just gonna get
past that let's pretend I have a
high-rise top on and let's just carry on
with a makeup look now I'm looking for a
bronzer okay here we go my mum has got
the hoola light so even though I use
normal hoola my mom's got a darker skin
shade than me and choosing the who
delight so I mean let's give it a go I'm
up for trying new things I have this as
well but I really like it so I'm gonna
use it the morphe e4 brush just dab that
in and then we're gonna contour up now I
don't actually know if my mum use it is
on an everyday basis that's a really
really subtle contour but that's really
nice actually I could see why my mother
who needs this shade over the other
shade because oh my god I actually
prefer this to my own on a serious note
this is so much more natural it doesn't
look like I've been up a chimney
my hair's half-up half-down today so I
am really gonna contour on my temple
just to make it or blend it into my
hairline as you can really see the color
difference going for a bit of a
different hairstyle today let me know
what you guys think I asleep with my
hair in plats and then this is what we
ended up with so I'm just going to carry
on contouring up by really really like
this but I'm not just saying it I
actually really like it
there's just given me the perfect amount
of color because I think if it was any
darker then I would have looked really
weird okay we are all contoured up I am
feeling it so now we're going to go in
with a blush and a my role is to really
go in with blush but I can only see two
here so we've got the laurio and the
blush in the shade Rose Fanta
oh no sandalwood pink there we go all
she's got this Mac have a lovely day
lip and cheek color I was with her when
she bought this this was the first Mac
thing that my mum bought and it's like a
lip and cheek tint and it's like this
consistency I don't feel like that's
gonna suit well with my skin at all so
we are gonna go in with the powder one
and this is the l'oreal one so let me
just grab a brush up brush and we're
just gonna pop this onto my face and by
the looks of it it is very very
pigmented and yeah that's why my mum
looks really pink all the time not in a
bad mood my mum has such rosy cheeks and
she's obviously white because you know
she's super super pigmented and now
we're going in for the bad boys we are
going in with eyebrows and my mum used
to use an eyebrow pencil and my mum used
to have that very thin eyebrows that she
even knows it she hated it and now she
goes in with a bit of a thicker eyebrows
you know just killing the game and my
mom uses it benefits browsing as you can
see this is super super used she uses by
the looks of it in this one but I'm
gonna need to use this one because even
though I have is pretty similar I feel
like the dark brow or I don't know maybe
I'm just gonna have to try both but she
also doesn't have an angled brush so she
just uses this and this is what I'm
gonna use as well so I'll start off with
the lighter shade and I mean I'll see
how it goes but if not then I'm gonna
have to go in with darker shade this is
such a hard brush to do my eyebrows with
because it's so tiny or there may be a
mixture of both shades looks better I'm
thinking a mixture
shades long story short my mom always
get so many questions about why she
fills her eyebrows in the way she does
and basically when my mum was younger
she showed your eyebrows off and they
never grew back so that's a lesson don't
over pluck your eyebrows and don't try
and give yourself an eyebrow slip get
somebody else to do it for you I can't
tell if this is like a pomade or powder
or if it's just really dried up for me
that it's now like powder because this
is giving me so much precision it's
crazy I really really like this and if I
had a longer handled brush I feel like
it would look really really good
you know what that brow from what I can
see anyway actually looks okay I'm gonna
have to carve it out with concealer
because you know like the front bits a
little bit dodge but it actually looks
okay now we're gonna go in with the
other eyebrow and do the exact same I
actually have better eyebrow like my
left eyebrow is so much better than my
right one kind down below if you have a
better eyebrow because I just feel like
my left one just follows more other
shapes that I like whereas my right ones
just all over the place and again we're
gonna try and do the fade now I throw it
in and I'm gonna carve my eyebrows out
I'm gonna have to use a darker concealer
so this might not like highlight them or
whatever but I really need to do this
because they're not exactly the shape
that I wanted them to be definitely
prefer the right eyebrow just putting
that without there I always seem to mess
up this eyebrow why does this happen
okay I have done my eyebrows they're
really not how I wanted them to look but
they're actually like my usual eyebrows
but on a smaller scale and I feel like
they actually maybe suit my face better
let me know what you guys think down
below now we're gonna go in with eyes
and my mom has got quite a few different
eyeshadow palettes here which is got the
other decayed naked smoky palette she's
got a little nick quad she's got a Kiko
little set over nine I think I'm going
to use the NYX quad because this girl is
how I eat here looks really really nice
so I think I'm gonna go in with this
shade first of all and just blend this
all across my crease to see what it
looks like my mum doesn't actually use
any like false eyelashes or anything so
I'm gonna be super super careful with
what I've got on my eyes that first show
on the next palette is really really
nice it's kind of like a natural lilac a
brown shade and if blending really
nicely and really faintly into my crease
but to the point it actually looks nice
this is what my mom does every day by
the way she uses a different kind of
eyeshadows but she puts one eyeshadow
all along and then she puts one
eyeshadow in the outer crease so I am
literally copying my mom's footsteps
that's all blended and my mom loves
putting it glitter on her lid so that's
exactly what we're gonna do we're gonna
take the glitter shade from the NYX quad
and I'm gonna take this on a GWA brush
now I don't know if this is gonna have a
lot of Fallout by the looks of it it's
going to so over that's so pretty
you basically need a really flat head
brush to apply this if you want it to be
super super pigmented so I'm just gonna
use the most flat head brush that I have
and just pop this all on my lid I was
right there just does have a lot before
out so I'm just gonna have to keep
brushing that away so it doesn't kind of
settle into my foundation which it
actually has done they were actually
gonna have to put a bit of concealer
under the other right just because there
is a lot of fallout and it's not
actually brushing away so I feel like
I'm just gonna have to kind of cover it
up which I didn't really want to do but
though it was gonna have to be only
option that's something I always see my
mum do is line her waterline with a
white eyeliner but oh here it is oh my
gosh is tiny this was a Rimmel London
one and okay it sharpened so I'm just
gonna try and line my waterline with it
oh my god a watering like crazy but it
does open your eyes up quite a bit so I
can see what my mom does it my gosh my
eyes are watering I think I'm gonna have
to take a two minute break out because
whoa that's kind of the basis at my
mom's makeup and now I'm gonna go in
with a mascara so my mum always uses
roll the lash but recently I gave her a
bad girl bang because I had two of them
so I'm gonna go in with a little bit of
roller lash at first and then we'll top
it off away that bad girl bang because
if you guys haven't seen the new benefit
mascara insane I'm quite lucky in the
fact that I do have quite long eyelashes
but it just takes me a while to kind of
build them up so you can actually see
them if that makes sense so I'm just
applying my
a coat of roller lash and this mascara
is so good but it's more for my mum's
eyelash type rather than mine so while
that layer dried we will go in on the
other eye and apply another layer of
roller lash like I said this is my mom's
everyday mascara and my mom's got quite
sparse eyelashes here is what the
mascara looks like and now I'm gonna go
in with these Batgirl bang which we're
both loving I've said it over and over
it's just an amazing mascara it's so
black as well that he does kind of man
what eyelashes look like they're false
when I had this on the first time
somebody asked me if I was wearing false
eyelashes and I literally that was a
biggest compliment ever do you realise
up and there is my mascara done on that
eye now we're gonna go in with this eye
as you can see roller lash just gives a
bit more of a natural finish whereas I
like to have my eyelashes quite big
quick black quite bold so there is the
eyelashes done I actually think that
that was quite nice it basically just
looks like a really really natural
makeup look on me now I'm gonna go in
with highlight but only highlight that
my mom appears to have is the Urban
Decay Naked illuminated trio so I'm
still have to go in it with this
highlight and it's got a nice big mirror
so well I could see my whole makeup now
I'm just gonna go in it with the middle
shade of highlight and I'm just gonna
cut close on my cheeks it's really
really pink toned but obviously my mum
really likes but I like kind of like
white toned highlight is on me all that
it's giving me such a pretty glow that's
the glow I needed to complete my makeup
look than me no makeup look is
completing with her highlighter
now we've got a lot of lip choice but my
mum tends to go for a liquid lip she
never really goes from matte lips so I
think alright I'm gonna go in with let's
look for a lip gloss because she does
always go with a girl off so we could
use the lip gloss from the body shop in
Apple taffy cuz that looks really pretty
all these cookies she's been using this
a lot recently it's the matte lipstick
in there and it's a mini that I gave her
she's been using that a lot but I think
I'm gonna go with a gloss just because
my mum does like to have a glossy lip
and I do
usually wear a glossy lip and this
literally it is like my mother's
everyday lip and now I can smell it I
know this is what my mom wears about to
really like this like you want to start
wearing more lip glosses because this is
so nice
the body shop was such a nice formula so
as you can see this is the finished
makeup look I actually kind of do look a
little bit like my mum and I feel like
if we had the same hair and we stood
next to each other and we would look
very very very similar I really hope you
guys have enjoyed this video if you
haven't remember to smash a massive
thumbs up let me know what you thought
down below in the comments I think it's
really good I mean all my mum's makeup
is really good it's just different
shades and obviously because it's not
what I'm used to wearing every day it's
really hard to create a makeup look with
it because I'm used to wearing kind of
very similar products every day although
I thought I've done really well with it
and I feel like I have recreated one of
my mom's makeup looked really well so if
you do also think I have remember such a
huge thumbs up comment down below your
favorite makeup product that I use today
and other than that
I really hope you enjoyed and I will see
you on Sunday at 10 a.m. for a new video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
