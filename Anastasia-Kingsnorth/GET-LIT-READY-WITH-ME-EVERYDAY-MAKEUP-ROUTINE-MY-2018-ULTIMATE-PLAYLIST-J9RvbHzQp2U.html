I am going to be doing a guest lip and
ready with me video for 2018
I saw Luis do this and I was like that's
such a good idea I'm gonna do this
because I wanted to do another makeup
tutorial I also wanted to show you guys
my favorite music so I thought what
better way then combining them both
together so I really hope you guys enjoy
this video if you do remember to smash a
huge thumbs up and let's just get
straight into it we're gonna start let's
get ready with me off by priming my face
because this face needs some primer on
it you know it feels really rough so I'm
gonna go in with the Smashbox photo
finish foundation primer i usually use
at the green one but today i thought i
would go for the normal silicon based
one just because i haven't used it in a
long time and i just thought why not so
in this video like i said i'm going to
be showing you basically some of my
favorite music at the moment I've got
about 15 songs not all of them are gonna
be like trap house music which is what
you kind of seen a lot of these
playlists there's kind of a very much of
a mixture just basically music that I
really really like and I thought you
guys would really enjoy this type of
video but forget ready with me chitchat
whilst listening to my favorite music so
that's what I'm gonna do although I did
get this idea from Luis so shout out to
you babe so I saw you do this I thought
it's a really good video idea so if you
haven't already seen Louis's I will
leave a link down below next I'm going
to go in with the collection lasting
perfection color correcting a concealer
because we are looking a little bit red
Anna I don't want to be looking red just
gonna pop this on the areas where I like
to put my normal concealer and you guys
are going to be super happy because I
got a new Beauty Blender they could
loads of you were like oh my god your
beauty renders disgusting and I kept to
my word I chucked his straight out after
that video it was horrific
I know but guys can you see how much is
concealer actually helps tone down my
skin it's so much better cuz my skin's
actually got so much better and if you
do want to see your skincare routine
then please let me know down below but
it's got so much better
is up next and we're gonna go in with a
mixture of my two favorite foundations
at the moment we've got the Marc Jacobs
and the L'Oreal True Match I mix these
together because they're just amazing
and I thought I haven't blended on my
concealer even though I have it's just
because it's gone quite a light on my
face but I'm gonna add these to my face
and this is the first time I'm obsessed
at the moment I feel like everybody's
kind of obsessed with it but I feel like
everybody's kind of listening to that
song at the moment and I really like it
the Marc Jacob one is a bit of a darker
shade and the loyalty match is a little
bit more of a runny consistency so when
I mix them both together they just
create the perfect foundation for me
plus both of them on their own are
amazing like I've stood by this and I
always know that the L'Oreal True Match
is my favorite foundation of all time
and if you haven't tried it already that
a hundred percent you need to because I
can guarantee you'll be obsessed with it
and again I know I'm not going to put it
on my eyelids but it works really well
for me as an eyeshadow primer as you can
see my foundation it looks super smooth
that's basically it and I'm just gonna
go in with concealer and other staffs
with this look I love it for concealer
we're going to go in with a bit of the
first impressions today and I'm very
excited for this and this is the Urban
Decay brand new all nighter concealer -
in Italy shade fair neutral this was a
kindly sent to me in my PO box and I
spoke about it a little bit in on my PO
Box haul the other day so if you're
haunting that already links down below
but I think it's going to be a really
good concealer because I'm obsessed with
the all nighter foundation and this
already feels super super creamy and it
doesn't feel like I'm putting too much
product on my face even though it looks
like I am this is a note so another
I don't really like this concealer as
well this is such a good concealer it
hasn't gone cakey well I said how they
were cakey it's gone a little bit cakey
around my nose but I don't think that's
the concealer I think that's my beauty
blender because it's really new I'm now
just going to take my new tart to brush
it so I'm very excited to use and the
Rimmel stay matte powder and I'm just
gonna set all of that in place because
you know the girls got all your skin and
I just don't want to only skin I'm
obsessed with this song by Julie from
the moment I blow your mind
I love now I need to do my eyebrows I
hate do my eyebrows on camera I'm gonna
do a little bit of them on camera and
then I will go off camera to finish them
but I use the anastasia dipbrow pomade
and it's Lily England angled brush and I
basically have a better eyebrow and that
is this eyebrow here my left one so I'm
gonna do this but I just start off
halfway through my eyebrow just kind of
giving it a bit of shape my eyebrows
really need doing and every time I go to
watch them because I haven't done it in
so long
my eyebrows literally like I can't even
tell you how much it hurts I end up many
crying so I need to get them waxed but I
just know that I'm gonna be into so much
pain I just don't want to do it this is
basically how I do my brows there's
nothing really that special and then I
do end up like carving them round with
concealer because they never really go
the exact shape that I want them to just
by kind of free handing them and then I
just take the brush and drag it to the
front and just do a little upward flicks
to kind of blend it out and to give me a
bit of a fade I mean I never get the
fade that I want because it's so hard
you know that's actually not too bad but
that's basically how I do my brows and
then I'll just come out with concealer
do the other brow and then I'll be back
now we've got some more barrels and I'm
feeling a little bit better I'm going to
go in with a brand new purchase
mine and I'm really excited to use this
this is the park add princess contour
palette from tarts I used it yesterday
but I feel like I used a too big of a
brush and I didn't get as much precision
as I wanted so today I'm going to use
this at nan Chi brush I'm just going to
go in with a mixture of the two lightest
shades and just try and contour my face
up a bit really it's very pigmented so I
don't know how much I'm going to need to
use and also Julie pearl have you
surname everybody sits differently is it
killing the game right now and I also
love her new song I don't give up not
going to swear because you see what I
mean like it's a really good color like
it's a beautiful color but it goes on
quite weirdly maybe again it's just
because it's new and I'm not used to it
like that sides got on better than this
side I really really like it I feel like
actually is my shade for once but guess
I'm just gonna contour my forehead and
carry on doing it I just I don't know I
really wanted to like yeah I do really
like it I do like it I just need to get
the right brush because it is so
pigmented
I feel like contouring my jaw bone just
gives me a massive foundation line I
said this in my last makeup tutorial as
well even though I still do it but
everybody goes on how I foundation I'm
like you know what yeah I have one we're
gonna have to get over it Finders
Keepers it is a song by Mabel and I
think it's amazing but I found this
remix called the dusk remix and I'll
skip into a bit but it's so good
I think this blush is so pretty I've put
quite a bit on good it will wear off
obviously now I'm going to zoom in the
camera a little bit am I going to go in
with the eyes and I think I'm gonna do a
very Brown map to look today nothing too
in-your-face you know so I've been doing
some quite in your face looks on my
Instagram recently so I'm just gonna do
a very matte kind of everyday tutorial
today and for that I'm going to be using
the violet or Voss palette this palette
is insane I'm obsessed of this so I'm
just going to take a little Real
Techniques brush little angled brush and
I'm going to go in with the shade
transition and that's going to be my
transition shade I'm also obsessed with
Justin Bieber friends at the moment I
think it's such a good song I love it so
that's obviously got to be in my lip
playlist
I don't think it's such a good song I
love it and I really like the lyrics to
really provide about this transition
shade it's super pigmented it's like a
muted orange e brown I think it's so
pretty now I'm gonna go in with the
shade are you kidding me which is a bit
more of a darker Brown and I'm gonna
kind of put this in my outer third
because I'm gonna do a really dark smoky
look this is a really nice shade it
didn't really work it's gone right in my
outer core number oh wow it's a proper
nice color and then I'm gonna change my
brush and I'm gonna go in with the shade
teddy bear which is a bit more of a
burgundy brown and they're going to mix
that with brownie points and we're just
gonna pop that right in the outer corner
and I'm just gonna blend that right in
the outer corner I'm gonna pin eyeliner
here anyway so it's not really gonna
make much of a difference but fill out
the darker the outer corner is the
better the inner corner looks and then
I'm just gonna repeat that on my other
eye as well there's actually a kind of
matte white shade in here so I'm gonna
go in with that shade and just pop it in
my inner corner I mean I don't know how
good this is gonna look but I don't want
to add shimmer I just want to be
completely matte that's actually really
nice I feel like that's kind of muted
down in a corner and the concealer so
that's really pretty I like that a lot
for eyeliner I am just gonna kind of try
to do a very thin wing today so I'm
gonna go in with the ICO skinny liquid
eyeliner this isn't actually that skinny
you'd think it would be more skinny
considering it's got skinny in the name
I don't know how many times I just said
that word we can do this and then also
another song that I've been loving at
the moment is no lie by Sean Paul and
again do a leaper I just love doing so
much I feel like this song has been
around for a while but I just
rediscovered it and I was like yes
feelin it don't be shy take control
but don't get me wrong it's a really
good eyeliner because it's really really
black which is really hard to find in an
eyeliner nowadays especially once in the
drugstore it's not the worst wing ever
but it's not my favorite I always wanted
to do one good probably gonna drinks it
now but eyeliner better on this I def I
think step oh my gosh I love this song
too big harmony I kind of underestimated
them along but now I'm going thing is
when your eyeliner is when it goes in
shadow now I'm gonna go off camera and
I'm going to apply it some lashes so
I've got these lashes here which are
from my law I've wore them once already
but they were super pretty and fluttery
they were like five pounds in the sale I
remember what exact ones they were but I
will link them down below or like elite
write them in the description so I'm
gonna pop some eyelashes on and I'll be
back I am back and I've got my eye
shadow a lot eyelashes on and right now
I am going to two of the lens at some
eye shadow underneath my eyes just to
kind of you know bring the look together
so I've got the shade are you kidding me
at the moment I'm just gonna be dragging
that right underneath the cellphone kind
of got me into this I feel like it looks
so much better if you drag actually
underneath like she did it for me she
put like black on they looked so good so
now I always do it
that looks so much better and now I'm
gonna go in with the Tarte lights camera
lashes mascara which again sack
recommended to me and I'm going to pop
this on my bottom eyelashes just to
again bring all the look together as my
eyelashes are quite big and extravagant
this mascara is so good I used it
yesterday and I could not get over like
somebody actually asked me if I had
false eyelashes on and also like whoa
like if you decide if I've got false
eyelashes on and these one natural
eyelashes this mascara must be insane
because I've never been asked that
before that looks super super pretty so
now I'm gonna go in with highlight and
I've got the CRA London highlight in its
starburst this is hand style at my
favorite highlight at the moment so I'm
gonna pop this on while I listen to a
bit of motorsport because I'm obsessed
with that song if I like a lot of people
are I love Carnaby's first I also love
Nikki's but I love Carly Lisa gets it oh
I threw all sit-on-top him the other day
shameless baby babies the same
name's Libby ass-kissing
why would I happy some beat and that
could just happen of course doesn't she
go do what but that's not a reliable
source can we just talk about how
gorgeous and blinding this highlighter
is like I could not be more obsessive
there I've used so much of it I'm gonna
be hit in pan and that's never happened
to me it was sent to my PO Box a while
ago and I've been using it in my
everyday makeup routine since I can't
remember if I view this in a tutorial
and I've even used it in my last one
because I'm that obsessed
we've got a few songs left we've got oh
we've got quite a few songs left next
one is body a cardi I think this is such
a cool song honey it buddy and of my
buddy Kristen yes Mabel again with fine
line she is killing it
pullips I'm gonna go in with you Nick
sat lingerie
oh my gosh if you have watched - us logs
you will know that we are upset at the
greatest show man this is me is one of
the best songs that I love it
that is the finished makeup look I
really really like it very kind of I
wouldn't say natural but it's very muted
toned so it's really good for everyday
use and even if you're going out and I
like you could just add a bit of sparkle
and you're there I really hope you guys
enjoyed this video if you did remember
to smash a huge thumbs up I love filming
this video I hope you guys like my music
as well it's a bit different to some of
the others I've seen it's not
necessarily all trap and house music but

to so if you guys enjoyed it if you do

will see you on Sunday at 10 a.m. for a
brand new video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
