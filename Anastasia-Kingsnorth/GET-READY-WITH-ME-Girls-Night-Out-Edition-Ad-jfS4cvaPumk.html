back and I'm really doing a get ready
with me it girlie night out at least
cinema Edition now I'm doing this to
celebrate the release of the brand new
movie age of 17
starring Hailee Steinfeld and I'm super
excited for this movie I watched a
trailer months ago and trailer first
came out and I'm finally going to see it
with amber so I'm super super excited so
I thought I would film me getting ready
and then letting you know what I thought
of the film at the end I'm super excited
for this video and this makeup look
because you guys requested that I do a
makeup tutorial like this in a previous
video I wore kind of this Christmasy
reddish makeup and so many of you are
asking what I was wearing
so I've recreated it for you today and
yeah so I really really really hope you
enjoy the video and let's get started
before I started the makeup look I
primed my face with the benefit
professional and filled in my eyebrows
with benefit brow I'm actually enjoying
filling in my eyebrows so I promise you
will see more eyebrows filled in in some
videos to come so I then started off a
makeup look using the makeup geek
eyeshadows so I first of all took this
neutral brown shade I'll leave the exact
shade in description box and I just
blended this all in my crease this is
such a natural shade and makeup geek
eyeshadows are really easy to blend
which is one of the reasons why I love
them I then took the shade bitten which
is a kind of off burgundy color and
again I just pop this over the brown I
wanted to go for a very simple natural
look in my crease as I was going to do
some really popping glitter on my lid so
I use the Too Faced glitter glue and the
LA crystallized glitter and I pop this
on my lid
I adore this litter so much I picked it
up in the Black Friday sales from Beauty
Bay and it's so gorgeous mine is in the
shade angels tip I believe and as you
can see it's so so pigmented and it's
exactly what you see on those Instagram
goals photos and guys have finally found
out what it is so definitely get
yourself some of this because it's
incredible and once I pop this all over
my lid I just brushed off any excess
using a wet and wild powder brush
now leaving my eyes for a while I took
to my face I use the Make Up For Ever
Ultra HD foundation and the l'oreal true
match foundation mixed together I just
put a pump of each on the back of my
hand
swirl them round together and then just
pop it on my face both of these
foundations together given absolutely
incredible coverage I use the lobby oh
one all of the time on its own but then
I discovered that mixing the makeup for
everyone with it gives it ten times more
coverage and as you can see it's so
smooth and looks airbrushed when you
pull it on it's just absolutely
incredible and even though it's a little
bit more on the pricey side I would
definitely recommend it put on your
Christmas list because it's such a good
thing to put on your Christmas list now
we're going up to Christmas so yes I
just put those on my face and as you can
see it gave me a flawless base to work
on I then took my Beauty Blender with my
favorite ever concealer which is the
collection lasting perfection and as you
can see because my foundation is a
little bit darker than the concealer now
the concealer makes it look a bit more
highlighting which is exactly what I
wanted because before my foundation was
way too light so I just went up a shade
and it looks so much better now this
concealer is my 100% the Holy Grail
concealer I literally could not live
without it I've used it for way over a
year now and it's only 4 pounds to buy
from any drugstore so if you don't have
this already please go and try it i rave
about it all the time
I then recently brought a new powder
which is the collection loose powder and
even though I don't bake like everybody
else I attempt to this is just my form
of it and it was fine so this is just
how I do it I just pop it on my face
using my Beauty Blender leave it 30
seconds and then just brush it off using
the wet and wild powder brush this sets
our makeup a lot longer than press
powder so I just much prefer to do this
and as you can see it really does
mattify the areas as well as give them
an extra bit of coverage to bring back
some color into my face I just contour
to my face using the benefit hoola
bronzer in the hollows of my cheeks I
absolutely adore this bronzer I've had
it in my drawer for a while but I've
recently rediscovered it and every time
I do contour this is the bronzer I
always reach for so I would definitely
recommend this and then I took my
Beckert champagne pop highlighter and I
just pop this on my cheekbones on my
inner corner the tip of my nose at my
Cupid's bow and my brow bone this is one
of the best highlighters I've ever used
this and mary-lou manizer are incredible
and I don't really find myself reaching
for any of the highlighter that often
other than the Anastasia glow kit those
three are just absolutely incredible I
then took my benefit better than sex
mascara I was really stuck between using
false eyelashes from velour or this
mascara in the end I just thought it'd
be easier to use mascara so I just pop
this on my eyelashes as you can see it's
proper black it really makes them look a
lot longer and a lot thicker as well
which I really like and I loved my
eyelashes looking pure black which is
why I really like this eye shadow
eyeshadow mascara and then finally I
took two lipsticks so this is the Lime
Crime Velveteen I'll put the exact shade
in the description box but this is the
lip color I was wearing in last week's
video and you guys absolutely adored it
so I just used it again and I loved it
too it's so beautiful and it makes your
teeth look really white as well which is
always a bonus so yeah I just use that
and that completed my makeup look
for hair I just went is my simple
straight side parting this is so so
simple and easy to do and because I just
wash my hair my hair was super silky and
soft as well and then I just used my
zoella bake my day perfume and that was
it I was ready to go to the cinema
reducing the toilet it was genuinely
incredible I absolutely loved it I found
it so relatable we were sitting there
comparing ourselves to the characters as
it was going with me what do you think
of it it was really good actually a
chick flick it was just more like a teen
lady I was 14 or far away before our age
which I liked
seriously it was genuinely incredible
like I wanted to go and see it for ages
ever since I saw the trailer so I would
100% go buy tickets now a link will be
in the description so that is the end of
this video I really hope you enjoyed it
I hope you enjoyed the little vlog style
element of it as well because I really
want to start vlogging I just don't know
whether I should or not make sure to go
and book your tickets to see the edge of
17 I will leave a download link in the
description box down below and let me
know your thoughts using the hashtag
edge of 17th its in cinemas now and I
would really really recommend you go and
see it so go down below and look for
tickets but yet other than that I really
hope you enjoyed the video if you did
smash a huge thumbs up and let's see if
we can smash 6,000 likes because this
makeup look was requested so hit the
thumbs up but yeah I love it also so
much and I'll see you in next week's
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
