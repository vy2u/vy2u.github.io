first of all to benefit that girl primer
and just applied that all over my face
to prime my face ready for my makeup I
did not want to wear foundation today so
I just skipped straight to concealer and
I was gonna be using my normal concealer
the collection lasting perfection and
just applying that all over my face
because I felt like he needed quite a
bit of coverage I then took the Rimmel
clear complexion powder and I just
powered it all of my face over that to
give it a matte type of look for blusher
I decided to go with my favorite blusher
at the moment which is the Mac dolly mix
and it just applied this on my cheeks
today for my eyes I decided to use the
new tooth palette so first of all I used
the first color in the palette all over
my crease and then inside my crease I
decided to see second color in the
palette which is on the top row and then
finally I used the fourth color in the
palette and then I just done my
eyelashes with the Maybelline lash
sensational mascara which at the moment
I'm really really liking I then finished
off my makeup look with a white cell
lipstick and mine is in the shade 9 and
I cannot get over how silky smooth these
go on my lips I just love them I then
did my hair so I just first of all
brushed it all out and then I decided to
put my fringe behind my ears and then
because it's spring now I wanted to add
a bit of something to it so I took my
Primark flower crown I just put this on
the top of my head and mess my hair up a
little bit and that was my hair and
makeup done
it was a bit of a colder spring day
today so I decided to go with some
patterns leggings from new look and a
patterned black jumper from new look
some pink dolly shoes from Primark and
then my gray coat from Xin side and my
back was also from Primark and then
finally my headband is also from Primark
so it sums up if you enjoyed this video
