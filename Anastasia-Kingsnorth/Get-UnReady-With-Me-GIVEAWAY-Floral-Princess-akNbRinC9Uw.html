going to be doing a get unready with me
as this is a video I've never done
before and I thought it'd be really fun
so my day actually started out when you
go makeup shopping
I just went to Northampton shopping
center and I decided to buy a new couple
of new makeup bit so I wanted to try and
I just got my mum to film we're doing
this because I wanted to add in and then
when I came home I just come into my
room
I just put my bag down and because I've
been out and busy all day I haven't had
chance to check my phone so I just sat
down on my bed for a bit and I just went
through all of my social medias
Instagram Twitter YouTube snapchat all
of those when I've done on my phone I
will just go to my skincare join my Alec
Brown drawers I'll just pick out the
chosen skincare that I want to use that
day so first of all I usually guy in
micellar cleansing water as all of you
know this is my Holy Grail products I
always use this I don't really want a
makeup with it but I get my eye makeup
off with face wash I then just
moisturize with your Garnier true rose
cream I don't use too much of this
because it can go pretty oily but I just
use a little bit of it to keep my face
masks and moisturize
I then just went in sat and chose my
bath buttocks I wanted to use so I
started to use the whipped clean the
breakfast verb and leek lean on me from
soap and glory I then just went to my
little left box and I decided to pick up
some bits so I was actually going to use
the floating flower bath balm but I
decided to save that for Valentine's Day
so instead I use the rose bubble bar and
this is just a little pink rose I
absolutely love this and then I just
went into my bathroom and started to run
my bath
in the bath I wash my body with the soap
and glory clean on the shower gel and
then to kill the dead skin cells and
just moisturize a bit more I decided to
use the soap before we smooth and start
breakfast scrub this is my favorite
breakfast scrub because it has o true
come and share butter in it and it just
gives the most amazing Maples type sent
off and it's just amazing and then I
just crumpled my bubble bar underneath
the running tap and as you will see it
gave off this kind of like dark pink
color to the water and it gave a ton of
bubbles which I absolutely love
when I got back into my room I got into
some pyjamas so both of the things are
from Primark it's just a short South of
pajama set and a gray jumper I then
moisturize with need Zarrella beauty
creamy matthew dreamy body lotion which
is hands-down my favorite body lotion
ever it's so soft and moisturizing zoe
has just created the most amazing
product and I just moisturized all over
my arms and my legs with this honestly
for four five pounds it is the best
moisturizer I've ever tried
once I've been on my phone I have a hot
chocolate and I put a ton of cream on
there so as you can see I got really
messy but I just want on my phone and
caught up on some pretty little lies I'm
currently halfway through season 3 and
honestly if you don't watch it you need
to and then then starting to read
