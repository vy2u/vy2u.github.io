channel was so for today's video I am
going to be doing this half drugstore
half high-end
makeup tutorial so many people have
requested that I do this because I have
so much hired makeup and I have so much
drugstore makeup but some of them are
just such good dupes for each other I
know that makeup can be so expensive so
to get a full face of makeup that looks
so good is really handy so I thought I
would do this video today just to kind
of show you the dupes that are available
and have shown you that drugstore makeup
is just as good as high-end makeup so I
really hope you guys enjoy if you do
remember to start a huge thumbs up and
other than that let's just get started
jumping a straight on in it with the
makeup tutorial I'm first going to show
you guys what I used to kind of prep my
skin at for all of the baked up so I
first of all use the Tarte brighterdayz
and moisturizer I love this moisturizer
I recently got it probably use it for
about 2 weeks now and it's so good so I
just prepped my skin using that and then
I and moisturize my lips with the EOS
lip balm in strawberry sorbet just to
give them a bit of moisture you know
before I start putting matte lip
products all over them and then I
perform to my skin with the
Porefessional primer from benefit now
I'm aware we're doing a half and a half
base why don't I have a drugstore primer
I don't have to bend them all because I
have them for way too long and it
would've just been bad to put them on my
skin so I'll just use this but
realistically primer shouldn't really
matter for this video but that's the one
that I have used we are going to start
off with the high-end side so I've got
my Beauty Blender and I've got the Too
Faced Born This Way Foundation so I
think we should do this side high-end
this side drugstore we are gonna get a
little bit of this and we're gonna put
this on at the side of my face now I
haven't used this in a long long time
realistically I don't know how this is
gonna blend I don't know how it's gonna
do like I feel like it's an okay color
match for me which is a good start for a
high-end foundation because I feel like
all high-end foundations are very orange
tone these kind of looks like what I've
been actually looking for then we're
just going to go in with my damp Beauty
Blender I'm going to be using two
different Beauty blenders for the
purpose of this video just so we can get
kind of even test I'm just gonna draw a
line don't get me wrong it's giving me
coverage but I really
like go in with my coverage I love full
looking skin you know but I don't know
if this is giving it to me although
saying that when I blend it a bit more
actually is kinda giving me full
coverage and compared to the other side
of my face you know it has covered my
redness quite well because I haven't
color corrupted in today's video overall
I think it's a really pretty foundation
you know we've got kind of like flawless
to a point finish you can see a bit in
my redness underneath it but you know
for the drugstore side I've got my new
Beauty Blender and I'm gonna go in with
the Rimmel London lasting finish 25 hour
breathable foundation are those claims
to be medium coverage let's pop this on
my skin and see how it is this is
actually gonna be the first impressions
I picked this up today okay it's
definitely more yellow toned than the
other one which I don't know how this is
going to go down so there is on my skin
although on the camera it does look okay
so I'm just gonna take my Beauty Blender
and we are going to bounce this baby
into my skin now straight off the top
you can see that it is two different
colors but I actually feel like this
kind of suits my skin better than the
Born This Way one because I thought at
the born this way when it's really light
this one is kind of like more natural do
you know what I mean so I mean that's
the only thing I say about this
foundation I am kind of having to double
layer it up however I am loving the
coverage now I've put on a second layer
that's what we're going for on the skin
as you can see they are two very
different shades but like I said once
you've kind of concealed and bronzed it
will look very similar but they're very
similar in consistency they're very very
similar in coverage if not exactly the
same coverage so considering the Born
This Way one is over 30 pounds and the
remember one is 8 pounds the fog we have
found a winner on the drugstore side
going back in with high-end we're going
to be using the Tarte shape tape
concealer now again this is very very
pale
this is definitely not going to do me
any favors in adding more color to my
skin but it is very good coverage and it
spreads far and then we're just going to
go back to the other Beauty Blender and
carry on blending this I mean as you
guys can see the coverage it's just next
level from this concealer and it is
amazing it's a lot of money and to ship
it over it does cost quite a bit of
money but you know it's it's amazing for
concealer on it the drugs
sorry I am going to go in with the
Milania retouch and a raise light
lifting concealer and they haven't used
this again in a while so you know the
color difference is kind of annoying me
and I feel like this concealer is
actually you want to know though is it
dark or is it like I mean it's a bit
lighter I'm going to add quite a bit on
just so I can hopefully kind of lighten
it up a bit because you know this
foundation is quite considerably darker
and going back to the other Beauty
Blender we're gonna blend that's
definitely lightened the foundation up a
lot and this concealer is really really
good coverage I picked this up in a shop
at Westfield Stratford I think it's the
Stratford well anyway or maybe it is the
Shepherd's Bush but I'm pretty sure it's
the Stratford one and like I remember
what it's called but I will link it down
below it's a really really good
concealer because I'll see Melania is
american-based as you can see the
coverage that has given me is insane
overall this side feels more dewy and
this side feels more matte I like quite
a dewy finish so why I'm gonna bake I
still like a Juve finish so for the
high-end side I'm going to be powdering
my face with the beauty of bakery flower
I don't actually have a baking powder
for the drugstore side I just have a
matte powder so I'm just going to use a
Mac angled brush and it's gonna dip this
in and then just kind of powered on my
face I don't think I'm gonna leave it on
there kind of set for a long time
because like I said I don't have a
drugstore
setting powder although I have heard
that the Rimmel London one is very very
good and then I'm just gonna kind of
brush it away almost immediately because
I'm not going to bake today this was
just to kind of mattify my face down a
little bit just to bring a bit more
color back although I do love this
beauty bakery powder and it's really
good when you're contouring to kind of
cut it into a very sharp line I use this
foods baking powder a lot and I think
it's really really good now all for my
drugstore side I'm gonna go in with my
trusty Rimmel stay matte powder that is
looking very worse' where I put my room
techniques brush in it and just brush it
all over my skin I love this powder it's
an absolute classic it's four pounds
versus this one which you like 25 and
it's so good I feel like it had its time
and years ago like everybody was using
it on camera the sides might look very
different but to me now they look almost
identical we need to add some brows
this face because my brows are looking
very very bare for the high-end side
we're going to go in with the classic
anastasia beverly hills dipbrow mine is
in the shade taupe and on our where I do
need to change the shade of my dip brow
but it is nearly running out I love this
pomade so much I really didn't used to
like it I had quite a lot against it
actually but once you start using it
into the pot and you get kind of right
to the middle of the pot it's like one
of the best things ever I just love it
that is the brown done for the high end
side and now for the drugstore side I'm
gonna go in with what everybody says is
a dupe for that exact brow pomade and
this is the freedom be free to make up
pomade mine is in the shade ash Brown so
I actually feel like this is gonna be a
bit of a bit of change although it does
it very similar I haven't actually used
it before this is going to be a bit of a
first impressions as well but I see
everybody say that this is such a good
dupe for it so oh no oh gosh it
definitely is darker though kind of
liking it it's very smooth to go on it's
definitely not clumpy and it's giving me
a really nice color actually I think I
kind of need this kind of all the time I
was so close to buying blonde but
something told me to buy this color that
it's really easy to create an arch yeah
I really like that I really like that a
lot kind of prefer it so we're just
gonna create kind of fade at the front
just flicking it up brows are on and I'm
not gonna lie I definitely prefer this
side so the freedom brow pomade is
winning at the moment now we're gonna go
in and it contour this skin and so for
the high-end side I'm going to be using
the Park Avenue princess palette from
Tarte and I'm obsessed with this palette
I recently which is talking about it in
my vlogs and I think it's such a
beautiful one to have I'm gonna use this
brush from Real Techniques and I'm just
gonna mix all four of the shades
together this is extremely pigmented for
a contour as you can see straight away
but it is quite hard to blend once you
put it on it kind of just wants to stay
put and don't really want to move then
I'm just gonna go in and I'm gonna do
the same just up here on my temples just
to kind of add a bit more color back
because this side was a very very light
and then as I keep saying in our makeup
tutorials contouring here
I've got a foundation lie but it helps
so we're doing it anyway bits for the
drugstore side I'm going to be using in
the revolution ultra sculpt and contour
kit in the shade light to medium the
palette looks like this and I'm just
gonna take this shade here again wow
that is pigmented but oh this is so
pigmented it's actually darker than the
other side and it's super super
pigmented which means this is gonna take
some blending but as you can see like
that style too don't get me wrong but
this side killing the game for the high
end side I'm going to be using it need
to face a Papa don't peach blush and I
haven't actually used this before as you
know I have used this before but not for
a long time just gonna pop this in here
I don't know how pigmented it's gonna be
oh that's so so pretty I love it I don't
know how well you guys can see it but in
real life that's super pretty like it's
rare that I find a blush that I really
really like there's only a rare few but
I love that and then for the drugstore
side we are going in with the classic
sleek rose gold rush this is a treat for
the NARS orgasm and I do have the NARS
orgasm blush but I just thought I'd use
that one today they look very very
similar I'd say this one's a little bit
more rosier you know what they look very
very very similar now we're going to go
in with eyes and we're gonna see what we
can do for the eye look
so for the high-end side I am going to
be using the Anastasia Beverly Hills
modern and renaissance palette and then
before the drugstore side I'm going to
be using these soap X a revolution
palette I wanted to try both of these at
the same time for so long they have some
very similar shades in that I thought
I'm going to be able to create a really
pretty look with so as you can see
Sophie's palette does have a lot more of
a vast shade range there's some very
similar shade so I feel like I'm going
to do a kind of orange e purple toned
look today I kind of know what vibe I'm
gonna go for so we are first of all
gonna take the Beverly Hills palette and
I am going to go in with the shade burnt
orange and I'm just gonna pop this all
on the crease just as my base shade the
thing is with the Anastasia Beverly
Hills palette all the colors are so
pigmented that you barely need any of
the eyeshadows
you don't really get that much fallout
but the colors are just so pigmented so
realistically I do think this palette is
worth the money but there's some amazing
drugstore palettes out there are also
worth the money now I'm gonna go in with
the soap revolution palette and I'm
gonna take this shade in in the corner
here this is a very very very similar
shade so oh my god that's so pigmented I
also love the massive mirror in this
South palette I'm just gonna put it out
there these look very similar shades but
I do prefer the drugstore shade now
we're gonna go in with the high-end side
again and I'm gonna take the shade Rilke
which is like a orange II kind of shade
and I'm just gonna pop this all along
the crease and we're gonna blend it
right into the inner corner
I think orange eye shadows are so so
pretty and this one really pigmented
ones out there then it go back to the
drugstore side I'm going to take this
shade here where is it there and I'm
just gonna pop this again all on the
crease this has got a slight undertone
of shimmer which it's gonna be different
to the other now she could see they are
starting to differ a little bit in color
but it shouldn't be too too bad when I
start trying all the other colors the
drugstore side has definitely gone a bit
lighter than the high-end side now so I
am just gonna build this up and the
pigmentation of this revolution palette
as well I'm sorry I don't think I've
ever seen a more pigmented palette but
now we're gonna go in with the high-end
side again and I'm gonna take the shade
love letter which is this kind of
purpley pink here and I'm just gonna pop
this in my outer corner and really
really build it up but I really want to
create a vast outer corner shade I don't
want it to be right I want it to be kind
of perfectly toned that is so so pretty
I love that so much now to kind of
duplicate that we're gonna go in with
this shade here the only difference is
from this palette this shade is shimmery
but hopefully that shouldn't make too
much of a difference when building it up
because you'll notice the majority of my
eyes are shimmery anyway and the
pigmentation of this shade as well is
incredible I don't think I'm ever gonna
get over how pink this palette is like
so if you've done well go ignoring the
fact that it's kind of gone like
everywhere that is what the oil diffuser
can work so far I'm gonna cut it
there's no need to worry about it kind
of go in everywhere I am now going to go
back in with the high end side and I'm
gonna take the shade tempura which is
this white shade in the corner here and
I'm going to bring it up for the middle
corner and do kind of a half cut crease
using a GWA flat eyeshadow brush I'm not
cutting the crease to the point as well
I need to use concealer I don't want to
do that I just want to create bit more
of a dimension effect and when I'm kind
of like blinking and then once all that
is blended that's what that side will
look like so then I'm gonna go in with
the center's nails palette again using
the same brush for the opposite side and
using the completely matte white shade
which I'm buzzing to use oh my that
matte white shade is incredible like
that purely matte white actually so
pigmented alright I literally I can't
get over this oh my god like I actually
genuinely prefer this I like I'm not
just saying that I genuinely prefer it
here are the two eyes of what they're
looking like right now and now I'm gonna
go in with a nother color from the
modern Renaissance and I'm gonna use the
shade primavera which is a kind of light
Goldy color and I'm just gonna pop this
on here just to kind of blend them along
I feel like we just need a bit of a
shimmery shade on the lid just so it
doesn't look so mad and then this will
really reflect on the my eyelashes as
well so that will look super pretty and
then just duplicate that on the
drugstore side this is the perfect kind
of gold shimmery shade so I'm gonna use
this shade here and pack that on in the
exact same place the solar sails pilot
definitely is more gold toned other one
was kind of a bit more brassy now it is
time for some eyeliner now I feel like
on the high end side this is where this
is kind of gonna go a bit of a mess I'm
using the benefit they're real push-up
liner and don't get me wrong I love
benefit so much they're one of my
favorite makeup brands but this eyeliner
is so hard to work with so we're just
gonna line the eye I mean nothing coming
out it comes through after one it just
takes a long time for it to come through
it's a really good eyeliner but it's
definitely not my favorite that took me
literally like 5-10 minutes to get that
wing and it's just kind of all over the
place so don't know how I feel about
that but a fully drugs
I'm gonna go in with thee my code skinny
liquid eyeliner in a black and I
actually really like this I mean it's
not that skinny it does the job
sometimes I have really good on line of
days and sometimes I have bad days today
is a very very very bad day now I've got
some lashes on these lashes were from
GWA so they're only three pounds so even
though they're not high and I didn't
want to use like two different lashes
you know for the high-end side I am
going to be using in the benefit to
BADgal Bank mascara and for the
drugstore side I'm going to be using the
Maybelline total temptation to balance
my lashes in to my real lashes so the
bad girl bag mascara is insane I have
used this without having falsies on and
I'm in absolute love with it I think
it's amazing I'm not gonna lie when I
saw they were releasing another mascara
so I was lucky enough to go to the
launch I was like really another mascara
but it's so good right it said it took
them four years to kind of make and I
can so see why then for the drugstore
side going in with the Maybelline
total temptation this is also a brand
new mascara and is an amazing drugstore
dupe for it they're very very similar
the ones are different but the finishes
are similar now we're going to go in
with some highlights a for the high-end
side I am going to be using the Ofra
highlight now guys if you've been
following me for a long time you're
gonna know I love this Oprah highlight
is definitely the best for a high end
price I genuinely forgot how much I love
these but you can see immediately the
difference and then just to highlight
the end of my nose I'm gonna take one of
my Tarte kind of thicker headed brushes
and just give it a big of a blend
because you know I don't want it to look
as though it's just kind of dumped on my
face I actually wanted to look blended
in then for the drugstore side I'm gonna
go in with soy beans and the palette and
this is a highlighting palette and I'm
going to use a mixture of all four of
the top shades and again these
highlighters are in saying such a good
drugstore dupe for the Ofra because as
you can see super super pigmented as
soon as you put them on your cheeks and
then I'm gonna pop that on the other end
of my nose and as you can see they're
almost well they basically do give
identical
it's like they've blended so nicely for
lips I'm gonna go with a very very nude
lip so for the high end I'm gonna use my
ultimate favorite lipstick of all time
and this is the Too Faced melted mattes
the liquefied matte lipstick it's my
ultimate favorite I wear it all the time
I've got two NYX lingeries here and
looking at them I think the top one is
gonna be more suited and the top one is
silk indulgent so I'm just gonna pop
this on at the high-end side but I can't
talk what I'm doing it I'm sorry there
is it the high-end side done I just love
this lipstick so much it's not ultimate
favorite lipstick ever let's try and
beat it with the NYX lingerie in silk
indulgent and as you change your mind
I'm gonna swap it to the shade cashmere
silk because those are too pink tone wow
it's a little bit more Brown toned
rather than pink they look so similar so
that is the end of this video I really
