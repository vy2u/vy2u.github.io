back with another high-end versus
drugstore makeup tutorial so this time
I'll be doing a back-to-school edition
now a few months ago I did a just normal
high inverted drugs and makeup tutorial
and you guys loved it over a hundred
thousand people have watched it now
which is crazy so I thought I would do
another one but I thought I would do it
back-to-school addition as I'm never
seen this on YouTube before so this side
here is high-end and this side here is
drugstore and I actually prefer the
drugstore side personally I don't know I
just feel like the high inside is very
hard to color match especially for the
bases but I feel the drugstore side
looks very natural and minimal do you I
really hope you enjoyed the video and
let's just get started
so I'm starting off a makeup tutorial
with the high-end side so I first of all
take my Mac Studio Fix fluid foundation
now this is very dark for me as you can
see it's very orange toned which I feel
doesn't look great on my skin and then
on the other side are usually Maybelline
fit me foundation this is a little bit
of a better shade match it's a lot
lighter than the other one which is why
I like it and it's a lot more creamy as
well so I feel like it gives a very good
finish I then just used my Real
Techniques sponge to blend all this out
I feel like you could see a solid line
once I blended in the Mac Studio Fix
fluid showing it how to giving me a lot
of coverage however I do actually prefer
the drugstore side for this I just feel
like it's easier to blend and it gives
more of a Julie finish
for concealer on the high-end side I use
my benefit fake up I haven't used this
concealer in months and it was actually
really good it's a stick concealer which
I don't normally get along with but it
was very creamy and I feel like it was
very highlighting underneath my eyes and
my eyes kind of just stood out from the
rest of my face which is exactly what I
wanted and then for my other side I used
my L'Oreal True Match concealer which
again I don't get much use out of this
was so good it was really really creamy
and I don't know why I don't use this as
often as I used to it is just so good
and I felt like it really did give me a
lot of coverage especially on my problem
areas such as under my eyes and my chin
and my forehead I actually don't own a
high-end powder so I then just took my
lawyer too much powder and mattified
everything down this doesn't really make
a difference either way is literally
just a powder just so I didn't look as
oily throughout the video then moving on
to blusher so on my high-end side I use
Mac dolly mix this comes out very matte
which I'm not too keen on but it does
give a really nice natural flush and
it's not overly pigmented and then on my
drugstore side I use my NYX rose garden
which is absolutely beautiful and this
is my well my favorite blushes
moving onto highlighter which is
actually one of my favorite parts of the
makeup look
i use the mary lou manizer from the balm
on my high-end side this is so pigmented
and the glow it gives you is so natural
and beautiful and then on the drugstore
side are you two sleek contour kit I
don't use this often and I don't know
why because as you can see the glow is
so subtle but so pretty
moving on to brows which is something I
don't usually talk about on my channel
for the high end side I'm going to do
the benefit gimme brow which is amazing
as you can see it's so pigmented and
instantly gave my eyebrows a shape which
I really like and then for a Jeep of
that I use the Maybelline brow drama
this is so good it's like a fifth of the
price I don't know it's amazing and it's
not as pigmented but it still just give
a kind of nice shape and looks a lot
more natural for mascara on my high-end
side I'm going to go in with the Too
Faced better than sex mascara this is a
really nice mascara if you're looking
for a very natural finish as when you
touch your eyelashes after they feel
very thin and fluttery which is really
nice if you want a natural look it's
really pigmented if that's a weaving a
word for mascara it's so thickening and
blackening and it's really really
amazing and then on the drugstore side I
use the Maybelline lash sensational this
is my favorite mascara and I will never
fault this I use it in practically every
video because I love it that much my
eyelashes just feel like the perfect
consistency while after I've used this
and they just curl up like straight away
and I don't need more than two coats to
make it work full lipstick on my
high-end side I went in with the Too
Faced naked dolly lipstick this was a
lot lighter than I actually thought it
would be and was a lot more pigmented as
well I thought it was going to be more
matte but it was very very glossy so I
probably wouldn't wear this for school
even though it is a really nice lip
color and for a Jeep of that I used the
l'oreal color riche lipsticks in
Julianne's nude I believe this was it
wasn't an exact dupe again because I
imagined the two-faced one would be
darker but I really do much prefer the
Julianne's nude
so this is the final look I really hope
you liked it later that you guys know
that this drug suicide actually cost
fifty nine pounds ninety one to buy and
I think that is really good considering
all the products that I use but my
high-end site actually came to a hundred
and fifty three pounds fifty so
basically nearly a hundred pounds more
for a makeup look that I feel doesn't
look as good as the drugstore side I
very much a drugstore girl aha even
though I do love high-end brands such as
Too Faced but yeah I thought this is a
really interesting video just goes to
show that you don't need to go and spend
a load of money on school makeup you can
just go to super drop of boots and buy
things from brands that are in there
because they're genuinely amazing enjoy
this video if you give it a huge thumbs
up and let's see if we can smash ten
thousand likes for back to school videos
I love it all so much and I will see you
in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
