going to doing a huge lush haul for
Halloween and Christmas 2017 I am
honestly so excited for this video I've
known that I'm going to be doing this
video for so long now and I don't think
I've ever actually done a lush haul on
my channel okay I'm right on time I've
done one but I'm pretty sure I haven't
and I'm so excited because I recently
placed a lush order online which I've
never actually done before and I got a
bunch of their new Halloween and
Christmas 2017 products and my god 100%
hands down this year is the best year
for these products so just like I did at
Bath &amp;amp; Body Works cool I thought it'll
be nice to do a lush haul because these
are all things that I usually include in
big halls but I've never had enough of
each thing to do it on their own and I
really want to kill it with the autumn
videos this year so I thought this would
be a proper nice video for you guys to
see as I know you guys love lush hauls
just as much as I do if you do enjoy
this video make sure to give it a huge
thumbs up and comment down below what
product you are most excited to try if
you're gonna get some lush I am so
excited to show these products I
actually can't even but yeah I really
hope you guys enjoy the video and let's
just get started so I'm gonna start off
with the Halloween products and then
I'll move on to new Christmas ones so
because I want to get online that
actually sent me like a list of all the
different bathrooms I ordered and then
put it that's so nice they've put it
under Christmas and Halloween how handy
so we're gonna start off with the
Halloween bath bombs and this is the one
that I ordered this is literally just
called pumpkin
this isn't brand new for this year
they've never done this before and it's
literally just an orange pumpkin bath
bomb with a cutout face underneath it it
just says pumpkin at the pumpkin King
and this smells of oranges it's kind of
like a musky orange scent it's not like
pure zesty orange but it's very much
like orange II just as you'd imagine and
they've got all at the mark into the
pumpkin round there and then the face is
obviously cut out like a traditional
pumpkin and I love this I think it's
going to
anything that comes out inside of it or
whatever but it smells amazing if this
it's got a cinnamon bark oil and pimento
berry oil in it so that sounds very
interesting and I don't actually know
how much it was I think this one was 395
3 notifying or four pounds 50 I should
have kept that part of the order form
with me yeah this smells incredible I'm
so excited to use it and I'm gonna start
using these on the lead-up to Halloween
I don't know about you
Halloween's my favorite time of year
next we are moving on to bubble bars and
this is literally one of my favorite if
not my favorite Halloween product lush
always come out with and this is the
sparkly pumpkin bubble bar I honestly
you've got on this every year since its
come out I don't know if it came out
last year or the year before but I
remember I've had quite a few of these
in my time these smell so bloody good
now I can't quite finger point what like
the smell is so I'm just trying to find
it's called grapefruit oil in it and
cinnamon stick so you can maybe clearly
grasp it from that it's quite cinema
it's quite like musky I feel like this
sense for Halloween a very musky but
it's so nice it's got a little like bark
of wood thing in the middle trim percent
the pumpkin stalk and there's obviously
orange and proper glittery anything is
to try them from last year is it you get
glitter everywhere like I don't if you
can see my finger but it's now covered
in gold glitter the glitter tends to
spread and it does tend to stick to your
mouth a bit so if you're not really keen
of the whole like glitter in the bath
thing and glitter on your body I
wouldn't really recommend this but if
you don't mind it then a hundred percent
and I how do you think he's got a little
bit smaller this year I don't know it
just seems quite small but sells so good
and they create so many bubbles
obviously on hundreds that recommend
them I'm pretty much certain that this
was maybe like four pounds 50 or like
four pounds around that mark but like I
said I don't if you can see that my
hands are very glittery now and then
when you rub them they just spread even
more and then the last Halloween print
that I got for this year but this is
actually brand new out and I'm sorry
this has to be my favorite it's the
pumpkin in pink I thought I was freaking
out about the pumpkin orange but
obviously my favorite colors pink
hence my whole room and how they brought
in pink this isn't it she just called it
the pink pumpkin you shall go to the
ball in pink and oh my god she smells
different
don't rty I expected
well the same it's not orange one but oh
ok this is kind of not like a proper
floral e but it's got color at the
floral essence underneath it no see if
it's got a cinnamon stick in it again so
it's kind of like cinnamon E but the
only way I could describe this is it's
quite floral and this doesn't actually
have as much like pure literature on it
this is more like little glitter flakes
they kind of blend in because it's pink
but oh okay yeah my fingers and I'll
pick angled but this was the same price
as orange one and it's around the same
size this one's got a few or inventing
but they're all kind of different but
this smells so good this is like when
you look at lush pink products they all
tend to have a very similar scent this
goes along with that scent but probably
a little bit more of a musky way for
Halloween but yeah I love this so much
I'm so glad to use this and if you
haven't like gathered it's the bubble
bar I tend to break them into like four
or basic news break a bit off and it
creates so many bubbles but yeah love
this now moving on to Christmas at
products I am super excited for this I
have quite a few Christmas products to
show you I just don't mean no order to
go in so I'm gonna start off with bath
bombs so this bath bomb is from last
year I never like bought it before I
don't think but I know it's been out
previously and this is this is luxury
lush hood and it's basically a Christmas
pudding I think but not a Christmas
pudding because it's pink but you know
what I mean I love this so much it's
pink and it just got a rainbow polka
dots all over it then it's got some like
little holly leaves on top here but it's
kind of covered by the white with a
little red bit in the middle this smells
so good like it's not traditional
Christmas if you like traditional
Christmas scents this definitely is a
traditional but it's very kind of fresh
it's got a more fresh hint to it and I
do remember from when I watched your
tour isn't this on YouTube it gives you
a proper rainbow bath like all the
colors and the dots come out and it
fizzes so beautifully so now you're
gonna get not just a pink bath that
you're gonna have hints of yellow orange
blue green while the codes are in here
possibly a bit of red inside every color
you're basically gonna get from this
bath well this is no more than five
pounds I think this is about 4 pounds 52
by but it's a big big bath bomb so you
could even crack
in half if you really wanted to but very
fresh very kind of zesty almost and you
just kind of like hit you when you smell
it but yeah I love this so much I'm
super excited you have this go the next
platform is actually brand new out for
this year and I'm super excited about
this and this isn't the snow fairy fairy
fluff bath bomb now obviously when you
smell it it smells like traditional with
Snow Fairy shower gel and I've wanted
them to bring out like a bath bomb in a
sense no fairy for so long because I
love love shower gels but I just prefer
their other products and I've always
loved the Snow Fairy scent and this is
just it it's so sweet it's so like
floral e I don't know just it's so good
and it's basically just got a star on it
and then it's just got these little
circles around and then it's a circle at
the bottom as well but it's basically
all pink and white so my guess is you're
gonna have a very pink bath again this
was no more than five pounds I think
this is about four pounds fifty and it
smells so good there's quite a lot of
excess coming off of this one I'm just
kind of like blowing everyone I guess
that's because it's been like packed to
me in a box but so I was so good and I
love this again it's very big and just
like the pink and white side of it it's
very me it's very very me
and then the final lush Christmas bath
bomb that I decided to pick up is this
one and this is called Christmas sweater
sweater whether that is a mouthful and
this is super cute it's things like an
off red bath bomb with a classic
Christmas sweater print on it so it's
got like the dots and then it's got two
reindeers in white my guess is your bath
is gonna go very red from this because
the white is definitely not going to be
able to overpower the red oh okay that
our traditional Christmas this smells
are very cinnamony very herby quite
musky basically a traditional Christmas
scent like you know those oranges with
in little bits in I'm not really sure
what you call them but kind of smells
like that again this is very big and
it's got cinnamon in it yeah it's got a
lot of cinnamon in it and ginger powder
yeah it doesn't cut off gingery it's
really good though and this is actually
one of my favorites because it makes you
feel a little warm and like fuzzy and
just Christmas the inside so yeah super
excited to use that and again this was
no more than four pound fifty moving on
to bubble bars I then of course had to
pick up one of my traditional favorites
and this is it can
Mountain I get this every single year
this is always the first one I tend to
add to my basket or pick up when I'm in
store if you like to pound 95 I think it
smells so good it's like there's no
fairy scent but a lot more like there
like it just sounds more fresh than that
but it's got the Snow Fairy scent to it
that makes sense
I love this so much it's basically just
white and pink and obviously this is a
bubble bar so you just break a bit off
and crumble it under your water and then
loads of bubbles will kind of come and
because it's just very very pink the
bottle kind of turns pink with its it's
kind of a bath bomb and a bubble
borrowing one but I love this so much
and I get about seven or eight baths out
of this because you really don't need
that much of it I then have another
bubble bar and this is so cute this is
brand-new for this year and this is
called the snowman dreaming of summer
how about loving hue is this it's
basically a snowman it's got the base
and then like the middle which is quite
squashed then the head and then I think
these are like dried-up chocolate
dried-up raisins and that's what they
normally are and then you just got like
the orange little nose and this is so
cute and Christmassy I actually love it
it smells like the Snowman that they
brought out two years ago I can't quite
explain this scent I'm not really sure
what's in it either it's quite musky
again and chocolaty in a way no I like
pure chocolate but you can smell the
chocolate coming through but it's really
good I think this is about three pounds
fifty so I'm definitely gonna get a four
or five bars out of this I probably use
the head wrap so I can break the head
into two and then use the middle and
then break that into two so that's
really good but yeah no no no how about
anybody else when you sold us you just
want to sneeze because it smells so good
oh I love it I want to stand it on my
little shelf in the background the final
product I got is called the Christmas
cracker snap bubble and pop bubble bar
and this is so ironic that is called
snap because it arrived to me snapped I
need to open the box and it was laying
there on top of the box it snapped in
half and I was like that is so ironic so
this isn't meant to be a Christmas
cracker and if I can swap hands and hold
them together you guys can see this is
so oh my god okay there is so I'm
missing the front bit because it's kind
of fell off down there but it's
basically just
snap it's yellow and pink and then yeah
this is basically a bubble bar I think
this was like 595 this is like the
biggest one that I've got as you can see
in comparison to my head but it's super
cute I love it it's very lemony
it's very lemony and very musky but I'm
just gonna break it in half again but
it's got a little bit of orange inside
as well this is really good and I'll
definitely get at least ten bars out of
there so like if I'm gonna pay six pound
we're gonna get a lot of ass out of it
but yeah this is very very musky to be
honest I'm not sure how much I like this
I'm happy it's on a bar form there's a
bubble bar cuz I don't really smell the
scent when I'm putting it in the bath
but yeah I don't know that's okay but
considering that was the most expensive
I wish it smell a bit more like as I
Christmassy so that is the end of my
Christmas and Halloween
lush haul I really hope you guys enjoyed
it if you'd remember to give it a huge
thumbs up I love filming lush holes
they're some of my favorite videos to
fill and obviously I didn't get all of
the lush products so if you do want me
to get the rest and maybe put them in
another haul or maybe even do another
lush or sometime soon then I definitely
will because I saw my favorite videos to
film and how exciting is it when you
just get a box like this turn up at your
house I love it but yeah if you didn't
enjoy it remember to smash a huge thumbs
up and I will seeing you at next week on
a Wednesday or Sunday at 6 p.m. at fave
brand new video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
