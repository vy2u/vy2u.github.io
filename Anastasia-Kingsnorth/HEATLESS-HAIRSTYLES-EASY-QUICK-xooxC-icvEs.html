back and I am going to be doing super
easy and super simple hairstyles I am
very excited to say to do because I
always get asked on a different
hairstyles that you can do and how I'm
doing this hairstyle all over into a
rollercoaster so I thought I will put
together a video a basically super easy
and what I mean easy I mean really easy
hairstyles that you can do the suit or
all different types of hair my hair as
you can see is very long you could
definitely get away with doing maybe six
out of eight of these on short hair as
well and definitely medium length test
these are also perfect for
back-to-school which is always be like
around the time this video is going up
so yeah you could definitely use a half
after school as well go on girl said but
yeah I really hope you enjoyed the video
if you did give it a huge thumbs up and
let's get started
for our first hairstyle we are going to
start off very easy so this is basically
a very high messy ponytail so my trick
to this is actually instead of using a
brush is using your fingers I just brush
my fingers through my hair and just it
gives a messy look like not a neat look
and I just kind of pile this too as high
as I wish I like it on the top of my
head I don't really like it went at the
back of my head as much so I just put on
the top of my head then I just put the
hair around it just like a normal
ponytail and then again push your
fingers in your hair and pull your hair
out make it as messy as you want to it's
completely up to you I do like it quite
messy and I like to pull out bits at the
front as well just to add an extra touch
but this is basically the easiest
hairstyle in the world but it's really
nice to go it keeps it out of your face
and it's good as well if you're going on
a shopping day or something like that
and it's just very hot
in continuation from the next hairstyle
you could also do a messy bun the like I
said I just put my hair up in a ponytail
twist my hair round and then twist it
round itself literally I prefer the
messy look without any bobby pins so I
put another hair band around it then I
messed it up a bit and I realize I'm a
little bit too much so I put another
hair band around it and that is
basically it I love a basic messy bun I
think it looks really nice yet really
like effective is that a word for hair
it is now I don't know this hairstyle is
a little bit more smart and it is a dead
sleek ponytail so I like to do this by
pulling my hair in the middle passing
and then just again scraping my hair up
they said of using my fingers I then
took a brush to sleek out this actually
works best if your hair is a little bit
greasy because as you know your hair
goes very silky when greasy so I just
pop this with the brush into a ponytail
at the back of my head just to give it a
very sophisticated look and I actually
really like to finish from the front I
look a little bit like an eggs but from
the side it looks really nice now making
myself crazy
number four is actually one of my
favorite ever hairstyles and is a messy
low ponytail so again put your hair into
the middle parting or side parting if
you prefer scrape your hair and tie the
ponytail lower this looks so very
sophisticated but the messiness is quite
additive more of an edgy look to it this
is why I love it I actually wear it a
lot and I used to wear it a lot to
school as well that is pull out all over
the front bits and there you have it a
messy low ponytail Lucy took me 10 15
seconds and if your hair just isn't
working with you do this
the side is actually one I tend to do
more around the house but I'm recently
going to start to work out more because
it looks really good so basically all
you do is pop your hair at the bottom of
your head twist it round and twist it
round itself again and this looks so
sophisticated yet because it's quite
messy again it makes it look a little
bit more edgy and all I did was tie a
hair band around it mess it up a little
bit and there you go and I actually
really like this again if your hair
isn't working do this literally takes 30
seconds and I love it
now number six is where things can get a
little bit more complicated so these are
the days where if you have a little bit
more time and you want to do a hair a
little bit more you know just so it
looks more put together this is the
hairstyle for you so all I did was start
braiding my hair normally but as I do
that pick up a strand of hair with every
new strand of hair I'm about to plat if
that makes any sense
so this is actually a Dutch braid I
can't do French braids on myself purely
for the fact it's the way that I plot I
think I plat over I'm not too sure and
you have to do it the opposite way to
get french braids but the way I plot you
get Dutch braids so then I just stopped
the Adly tip of my head at the top of my
head whenever you feel like calling it
and then just put a little hair band in
it tied it and there you go you couldn't
you could go all the way down and do
normal Dutch braids but I liked how it
looks with the rest of your hair down I
think it has a little something extra to
your outfit so I just did that on the
other side as well but I just spread
that up so you didn't have to watch it
again but yeah I actually love this hair
so I've seen it so many people do it and
I really didn't think it would suit me
but I actually kind of liked it in the
end so this is definitely one if you
have a little bit more time but it looks
so good when it's done
if you didn't want all of your hair down
at for number seven you could actually
put it in a ponytail this looks really
pretty as well I really loved how this
looks actually I might start wearing
this out more as well and then you could
just mess it up at the front and the
platters add a little extra something to
your ponytail especially if you're
wearing a very plain outfit and it's
super quick and easy to do as well
number eight is if you really do want
the clap but you don't want all of your
hair in your face you could actually put
it half up half down so just pick up the
two ends of the plats and then pick up
all the rest of your hair from the back
leaving the bottom layer and just tie it
with a hair bubble then you can just
bring all of your hair to the front or
leave it to the back it's completely up
to you but then just add a little extra
something and move your hair out of your
face however if you didn't just want the
ponytail hanging you could actually
twist it into a bun this actually looked
really nice I wasn't sure how this is
going to look but it looks very messy
looks very edgy the redoes spice up your
outfit and add a little extra something
to the back of your hair I actually love
this one this is probably my favorite
hair style that is it another video I
really hope you enjoyed it let me know
if you did by giving a huge thumbs up if
you do that comment below what your
favorite hairstyle was and also some
other hairstyles that you want me to try
out because these are very simple they
are very basic you knows a few braids
but I want to do them so that literally
everybody watching this video could have
a fair chance of doing them so yeah
other than that I really hope you
enjoyed if you did give it a thumbs up
and I'll see you next Sunday at 10 a.m.
