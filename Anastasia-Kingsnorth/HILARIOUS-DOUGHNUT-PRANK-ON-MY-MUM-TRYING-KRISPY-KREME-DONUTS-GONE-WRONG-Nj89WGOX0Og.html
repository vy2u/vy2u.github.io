yeah how will you want me to come out
for ya hey everyone is so fourth date
video I am back and I'm back in the car
for maybe this third time third time
it's the fourth time in the car
I'll make me the chicken nugget
challenge for time and I'm here with my
mum again who said she'd never be back
in a video except she's been in every
single day vlog and now she's I
have no choice honor and also my little
brother's here say hi hello @ek you're
gonna wave at again small looking
forward to eat chocolate donut I said
you could have a donut our ministers a
humor very very excited for that so I
walk to Tesco earlier and I picked up
this huge tray of a loyal friend oh no
he's here Anna Anna Anna Sui they meet
me to come with a whole instead okay
that's one there Anna bridge we can
attend one okay you told her like she
needs to talk now okay good boy you told
me I got that on there next it taste one
yeah sometimes you'll never make that
one good boy yes see next lip tint for
mana
I have a pimple back on there I wonder
no I'm sorry maybe I'm Anna and I lay
that one too aside that one with a habit
okay we're going to paint this wall okay
because kubark are intolerant hopeless
Cruzan Makani yes susana you're gonna
eat all that one on integral and knotted
ha 89 I wanna go can you sell it on your
Gandhi hug easy throw tiny caps
it's a role in it so we went Tesco I
bought 12 different doughnuts actually
picked them myself it just came like
this in the box to comfort my husband
the whole and we really fire Thailand so
we're going to trial at the weirdest
Labor's first and then make our way down
are going to try them all because some
of them are very similar but I'm excited
so I
one is a popin because basically Mun
thinks that we're just filming a tasting
Krispy Kreme donut video just like we
did with the McDonald's menu just go
with the Starbucks menu do you think
they're doing that but I actually had a
little idea this morning where I'm going
to prank her a bit so what I'm going to
do is I've got a bought a tray of 12
Donuts from Tesco just a critic rabbit
trailer 12 she looked at them she likes
melting massages I ordered a holder like
that does hunger like that so I'm going
to put salt and vinegar or some sort
andum condiments on the original glaze
I'm going to use stuff that will blend
in so she won't be able to tell and then
when she eats it hopefully the taste can
be really like after you discuss in
overwhelming that you have a guru strong
reaction to it that's my hope anyway if
it doesn't work it by other than you
goodness you just got obsessed in video
but I thought I'd try and turn it into a
prank so that is what I'm planning to do
so that is why the intros I call normal
and everything because she has no idea I
am here at the donut there are so many
donuts I think I'm going to go to these
ones oh my gosh I'm so excited to prank
one this is ridiculous
I love Krispy Kreme doughnut dough so we
got them here they are we put them in
the fridge well I put them in the fridge
just to cool down a little bit because
they were a little bit melted and I'm so
excited for this oh my god okay I think
I'm gonna put the salt on this one here
because I'll know not to eat that one if
it's in the corner if I put it on that
one I'll probably go for that one so
I've taken it out and I've got my salt
and I'm literally just gonna pour it all
over I'm gonna smother this thank God it
smells no different so I'm really happy
learn it just going to pour like turn on
a mumble finger sugar I've gone double
in on her and I've also sprayed it with
summer cooking oil so a good luck mum
I'm very excited for you to try it and
the good thing is it doesn't really look
out of place either I could turn around
but it kind of just looks like a sugar
doughnut and then we'll think that's
glazed and that sugar so pretty good
plan button think we'll go through this
one first because this is quite a tame
one to start off with isn't like
sprinkles okay so we starting off well
then I don't really know what this one
is that
and had that one like wonder how other
tribe it that's really nice
god I love crispy crab also not really
so if I told you guys what we do and we
take them to Krispy Kreme donut and like
yeah some of these aren't limited
editions is what the secret menu it's
very very sweet very I don't really I
like the donut part obviously but I just
don't want to sprinkle my perfect
without the sprinkles we cannot show
that lmg day that one day those are
going to save this one I promise you
we're going to go for this really sticky
one and it's like peeing on delays
absolutely all my mana screen yeah it's
almost glittery see I wish it was my god
just not going to believe it take a
strawberry ice cream it off my fingers
that I have to die is not good not
really like that looks good
sorry both chuckling nanos knife
that's not nice to an e-cig night no art
ana we host don't like the pink one no

so this point is just got like crosses
on in sugar but look sighs I didn't
analyze a local pie one community lies
