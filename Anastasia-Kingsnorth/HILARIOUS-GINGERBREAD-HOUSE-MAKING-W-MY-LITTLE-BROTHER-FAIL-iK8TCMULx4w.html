joined here with my little brother
Atticus and you have to cut your quite
down-low
today we are going to be making a
gingerbread house and I'm super excited
because back in Halloween well I think I
voted it like around October 31st we did
a pumpkin carving video with my mom and
you guys loved it we loved filming it
didn't work it was really fun so we
thought we would change it up with our
in a Christmas background got the tree
the pillows got a reindeer down there
got the Christmas jumpers on and what is
your Christmas tops a Santa loves this
dude you're on the nice list
yeah exactly that's why he's wearing
that one I've got one which is Mickey
Mouse the Primark X at Disney range from
Primark which I love
I do love Mickey Mouse do you love
Mickey Mouse yeah so today like I said
we are going to be making a gingerbread
house now obviously most people would
make this gingerbread house from scratch
you know like if you're feeling it you
could really go out and like cut the
pieces out yourself but every year when
we make a gingerbread house we can never
get it to stay together we ice it and it
just does not want to stay together so
this year we've gone the extra mile and
we bought a pre-made gingerbread house
amazing thing we're gonna be decorating
it for you guys yeah of course item on
the end of it
yeah bit of a nicer gingerbread man now
obviously you know we could do ourselves
but we actually wanted to make a
half-decent gingerbread house so here it
is mum bought it for us
hey finchy oh dear always sad to fell
down he wants to put some Twitter I'm
really excited to do this so should we
just sure just start let me walk you're
gonna cut it open I really hope you guys
enjoy and let's just get into the video
let me cut the tape off and then you can
undo it okay so let me dust
let's behold your help we hold it you
know be very careful
sighs oh that was any stipend eating but
if we open it out and let's write often
been really care for like the person I
get this gingerbread house outfit if it
you know if it breaks oh here we go here
is the gingerbread house
there's no sweets that box is empty
is it underneath no bear very because
I'm going up straight to our jeans
banging oh you're something like then
I'm gonna say we've got our eyes to
behind yeah yeah makes it all easier and
some sweet that's not gonna beat me down
one time I don't think there's gonna be
enough icing here but we do have another
tub of icing it was comes to no one here
we don't did you not keep my other nice
gonna smell it mmm
yeah it does it smells like gingerbread
doesn't it so I don't know about you
Atticus but I really want to do like the
fancy icing he's gone it's gone
oh no and then we've got the treats
decorate this is actually a really cool
gingerbread house that shout out to our
these are mine a business so we need to
scissors and I'm gonna have to like cut
the end and there's the exams and then
13 I'm literally not promising that this
is gonna be one of the most
aesthetically pleasing didn't recognize
you've ever seen but we're gonna try a
bear stop me Atticus okay you just
squeeze it out cuz it's really tough
okay
what what's up there down oh god let's
don't hit the ginger towns okay so if
we're just going to try and do it you
hold the end it's a really hard ice into
it doesn't actually want to stick to the
drum
this isn't quite going to plan how let's
go inside Oh which open dismantle or do
Anna has to do the icing first so they
stick on the ice show me what you've
done look Atticus so basically yeah I'm
just gonna have to I mean I'm not going
to I've really wanted to go to town on
this ginger house I really wanted it to
work
oh it doesn't look like I'm gonna be
able to pretty though isn't it good do
you wish I could just have a bubbly nice
flavor
listen yeah I mean the stock I haven't
done a bad job I think you only left one
have seen doubts feel me oh yeah the
actual gingerbread is but this ice in it
needs to be harder set it drip down and
stuff oh yeah I know but this is like
really hard then let's put some on the
other side do you like it asked her yeah
yes nothing could be very careful mommy
took the icing away mommy did chop my
arsenal Atticus mummy you answer to that
why because I thought that it probably
had been openly no so it wouldn't have
been no good to using okay now let's got
this yeah I'm funny everybody don't just
laugh okay no so quite a bit left huh
you do get more in the bag that I
actually need a from the Christmas tree
oh yeah we've got a save load for that
loads for them either way yeah
forty-four perfect a blender lag
how's it going lund away
let's it don't run the way yeah you're
thinking of the gingerbread man story
you won't varnish faster she can you
can't catch me I'm not doing it because
is performing in like the school Church
thing and Dave's dicking showing the
Bell thing Dave thank you sorry it would
have been cool if we had two different
colored icing you see the circle at the
front of the window yeah oh sure they
get the gingerbread man always and that
looks lovely
they're yummy
Thank You Laurie hey Nick Kodama love
everybody but me so what about my day
Oh
I ate one yes kawrench our walk yeah is
that one of the pocket things you got
the light of that like you want to try
one other concern oh you ain't got a
book like the bad-word cuz then fool
panning and a new car after that one I
think that's cuz you know I don't think
we could have made put love my house
good cuz that's so bad like this big dog
throw batting or any of I see Nana to
back up I think that's quite nice
oh sweet just drop should we do a little
pattern show me ain't got a few more
smarty sound like we should have bought
like loads of sweet I thought you'd get
enough I thought you'd get way more
sweets than you actually do I mean
you're doing that locally up to curb but
Sam or Danny but don't have to curse
what you like they don't do a bad name
no yeah ask us what are you most excited
for Christmas sweets your most aside for
the sweet tell everyone who are you

Atticus maybe he needs a good troop the
active dicta I think that looks funny

live in the be back yeah you can put
some decorations on the tree Atticus
what on that tree put the Smarties on
the tree or teddy bear storytime
