joined here with my little brother
Atticus is it hard to win again Atticus
is three years old so he finally thought
it would be cut up the right age to do
some pumpkin carving for Halloween
because you guys always won't have to
cut in videos this will be fun didn't we
yeah the pumpkin ask you think what
everyone that kind one second knows oh
no we're not doing a nose on it
why so as you can see we have our
pumpkin here and we've got a bit of
different autumn background say Atticus
is very excited so we are basically just
gonna carve this pumpkin so here is our
pumpkin as you can see I've drawn a very
basic pumpkin design on it as I'm not
very skilled
Atticus Betty's hot car when you do it
either so we're going to break simple
and that's kinda great left learn at the
earth in clefts pecan is eggs do we need
some scissors no it's gonna tear the
label off of it so first of all you have
to do first we have to rip the top out
and gut it out so we've got our Tesco
trusting a pumpkin carving kit which I
don't think it's gonna be sure enough
yeah oh it's in it's in me pick a little
ah you wanna put it on my arm okay this
