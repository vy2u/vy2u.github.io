basically have no makeup on I'm in a
different setup I'm filming a completely
different style video because I wanted
to try something new and bring something
a bit new to my channel so after last
week the response of me my mum got to
our video again was like insane you guys
adore seeing my mum which I love because
I love them in videos with my mum
they're literally my favorite to film
but we've kind of done like three like
in the car chat videos and I want you to
look a bit different today
so I persuaded my mum despite her saying
she wouldn't last week I persuaded my
mum to kind of film another video with
me but today we're going to be doing in
a kind of like mum gets me ready video
bottom line is my mum is basically gonna
be choosing my outfit do my makeup and
styling my hair but if you do want more
like vlog e style videos let me know
because I just don't ever do them and I
really want to start doing them more
because I've actually really enjoyed
like just filming this clipping this
like different set up I don't know it
just feels like something nice and
something different so if you do want to
see more of them give this video a huge
thumbs up also as a cheeky little side
note also go and follow all of my social
medias SATA 32 and Instagram at links
down below but literally like I'm
posting so much on there now it's summer
so if you want to keep up to date with
kind of my everyday life and kind of
maybe like watch me vlog on snapchat and
stuff guide me yeah other than that I
really hope you enjoy the video and
let's just get started so this is
basically my mom's makeup stash she
doesn't have as much as me but she does
have quite a bit to be fair I'd give her
some like makeup that I just don't
really like using stuff but the only
thing I'm worried about is she's just
not the same shade as me like this is so
much darker than my normal color so
that's anything that I'm worried about
but fingers crossed it will work so
mummy's gonna do a makeup she's got her
huge really heavy container of makeup
just here okay I'm gonna do Anna's
makeup how I would normally do mine okay
I'd normally first moisturize and that
you can't put foundation on without
moisturizer am i right also side note I
have dyed my hair a lot of you probably
don't know that I haven't really spoken
about it other than on Twitter but yeah
I have to
my hair is like light blonde all in a
bit of like a change for the summer this
isn't good like frond
ombre and I lost did you have some guys
eat good food mommy I'll try and do it
good Atticus I will try I will try
darling
is quite dry did I say moisturize yes
please we're doing this put your makeup
on somebody else so this is really yeah
I'm sure I haven't so this is really
weird anyways but it's not the white
color because if you look at your neck
Jesus Christ which I'm sure you'll be
delighted about Anna
next I'd go in with I go in with the
concealer I actually normally just put
it on but today I'm going in with the
concealer and I use guess what I use I
use your soap imperfection and I dot it
around here to cover them um backs
did you know you meant to do it in
triangles well yeah I do sometimes it
just depends
one question that everybody was really
really wants to know is why don't we
ever see your dad in your videos or why
your dad yeah basically I think it's
just because obviously I don't live with
my dad so I just don't really film
videos with him yeah there's something
that I should ask him to be in whatever
I could ask him to be in the video I'm
sure he would be I think he would be a
video I think he would be but like
something like a secret project thing
that I've been doing recently which I
don't really know when you guys will
find out because we're still quite an
early looks even it might not be done
you know so I'm not really sure okay but
my dad is in that and that's the first
time you'll get to see my dad so like I
do have a secret project and I'm a
youtuber that when they say that
everybody's like for God's sake a secret
project I said okay they'll get to see
you my name yeah well sort of me yeah so
the question is that everybody wanted to
know is have you ever lied and said you
were sleeping over at friends and then
went elsewhere that I know the answer to
this but do you remember your what about
what we can't obviously use names but I
rang you and I was like because I was
gonna stay home right
somebody's house banging ah sigh oh no
I'm gonna go sleep you know I don't
remember that I know I'll be honest I
don't even know what about that I'm
using a very light sort of Oh God pearly
shade to open the eyes but Anna doesn't
really need eyes I mean because Anna's
got really big eyes but mine are not a
speck which is why I'll reduce it's all
over my lid okay I'm going to do this
really quick and I'm not going to blend
it as much as I would normally do
because I think we want to time in it
are we ready guys when I do I do are we
ready everybody
comment about their mom why aren't I do
you either love them or hate em
personally I don't think this but each
to their line right so another question
is have you ever stolen anything from a
shop me yeah cuz your face lit up then
so your mouths off no I haven't stolen
anything
as in stolen anything but I have been
owning my day to change the label on a
few things so I guess it will do that
now I used to get a real kick out of
doing that that's terrible isn't it but
ya know I don't do it now I know I don't
do it that way deeply used to put reduce
labels on stuff always got away with it
if you Anna wasn't still uh-huh if you
know then why she wants two figures yeah
I used to like open the packets a little
bit and then like put three in one
packet if I really wanted it genuine but
I do live in Tesco for out yell inviting
them fat burning with Kiko and I'm going
to use um it's like a passionately pink
shade going up to the brow bone the brow
bone but this is what I do isn't it
obviously you know I'm no beauty guru
but this is just what I do on a date
faces when I can be bowled over makeup
on - I really can't be bothered and
sometimes it stays first I put makeup on
in about four days
it's a salon no it no it's an ANA I went
to Tesco's it's a no makeup on woman
shouts but I'll still don't know I'm
gonna have a go already I don't know I'm
gonna get over there some lottery London
lucky it's really good but it's running
out wing woman I'm gonna it's funny you
know I'm going to attempt to do oh we're
going on on earth I'll go to attend I'm
good Atticus you said how the hell but
you're gonna wash yourself anyway Jana
you're not going they say she's just oh
my god oh my god you're like one
no I then if I could be Barbie doll curl
my eyelashes with Primark pounds I'll
actually really good but mostly not my
doing and then I use the la vieille
that's not miss man yeah baby baby well
which is really good god you put mascara
on really creepily I can't okay why and
then what I'll do
whoa my eyes water and I have going move
who their benefit yes comment you know
how that you shouldn't use blusher and
contour same joint you should do one of
the other which emit oh you a line where
you got your contour in my whole face
you do a number three know that thank
you mom
what did you not know that well I did
know that but I do it so like I contour
this bit further than now you don't know
what you do like her it reads too hard
to show them but you do like a number
three obviously blend is where you can't
just oh sheesh
but and then I sometimes I have it on be
nice and
right we're going in way of the benefit
California which is a really pretty
summer color I think which you start off
with me
you got they sent you two of these so I
had one where one food I normally pay
twenty five pounds of Russia hell no one
for me and one for my sunshine and I
walked off and I'd yeah and that's why I
don't go I was gonna give it to amber
and she goes well no cuz I'm your
sunshine so I took it they go Olivia lip
butter okay
use it taste nice blueberry it's a
little bit with a big hot lacquer in
unreal take my little makeup okay now
Anna wants me to choose an outfit out of
my wardrobe that I would normally wear
to put on her it's a bit weird but I
thought she wants me to do okay they
even know what they call these thoughts
Susan died without was insane for it and
then she's got some skinny um ripped
jeans that would be my sort of probably
typical daytime outfit I don't even know
if I'm doing this right
okay are you ready hello I'm coming
it's weird seen why you became round
actually it's a nice outfit it's a nice
outfit but I don't think I look like
this at this time
babe okay you know what if this was in a
smaller size because I think this is a
12 looks like you spot the difference
this is the end of today's video I
really hope I'm not your judge by the
eyes in the end of today's video I
really hope you enjoyed it if you did
give it a huge thumbs up give it a huge
thumbs up if you want me to do this on
