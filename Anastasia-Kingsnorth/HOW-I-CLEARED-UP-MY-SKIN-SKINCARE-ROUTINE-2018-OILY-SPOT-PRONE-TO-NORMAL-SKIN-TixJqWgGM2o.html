today's video I am going to doing a
super requested one and this is my
skincare routine for the morning evening
and like pamper Edition but also how I
managed to clear up my skin I really
hope you guys enjoy if you do remember
to start a huge thumbs up and other than
that that's pretty much all I have to
say let's get started I get so many
questions every single video every
single makeup tutorial asking me how I
played at my skin and now by no means am
I saying that my skin is beautifully
clear with no redness no spots no
nothing because believe me it's not but
in my blog especially you can see my
skin has cleared up so much so matter to
the point I actually feel like a lot
more comfortable going out without
makeup now and I did anyway but I had so
many spots that I don't actually know
how I got that many I don't actually
have any photos that I personally took
but I have screenshots from previous
videos which I'm gonna put on screen now
well you will be able to see how bad my
skin was and it wasn't so much around my
cheek areas it was more especially on my
chin I used to have a running joke with
my friends right to call it where I was
goin because it used to be kind of
really like white we've got loads of red
dots I get them a lot on my forehead and
a lot around my nose and kind of like my
t-zone area and eventually I guess they
did spread out all onto my cheeks know
no matter what I did no matter how many
products I used they just would not
budge and then suddenly I started to use
this one product that I really liked and
it genuinely started to help my skin so
much so I decided to use the Mario
Badescu drying lotion and I've heard so
many people talk about this but I'm
always so envious to try new products
because I do have sensitive skin and my
skin has kind of changed which I will
talk about later on in the video but at
the time when I started using this like
it was super sensitive
it was super oily and I was like is this
gonna work so what you do is you
basically pop a cotton bud into the
lotion and dip it down into the powder
which is down
and then just pop it on your spots and
overnight it will dry them out now this
either works on under the skin spot and
when people were saying this to me I was
just like come on like surely not like
surely it's not actually gonna work
because I've tried different things like
toothpaste I tried like all the DIY life
hacks you see online and stuff and
nothing had worked and I bought this
from Urban Outfitters it was about 16
pounds and I try it on my skin and I
woke up the next morning and I realized
that they one is right okay I'm gonna
try this again tonight maybe it will
really work maybe it will look really
good for trying it again and slowly by
slowly like don't get me wrong it took a
few weeks possibly even up to a month
but they've really started to go down
and I notice that it was really helping
and I wasn't necessarily getting new
spots eyes that they weren't like but
they weren't worsening so that was one
of the main products I feel like really
did clear at my skin and I also found
skincare products that I absolutely love
and they maintained my skin to kind of
stay at this point where it is clear
look I've still got a few little
blemishes and kind of scars but he's
gotten so much better so the main face
wash that I've been using it's actually
nearly ran out because I've used it so
much it's the Garnier pure active
intensive antique blackhead charcoal
cleansing gel now I've been using this
since mid-december so we're going on for
like two months now and that's when you
guys started to comment saying wow and
like your skin has got so much better
what have you done and I was like okay
look maybe it's this then and I use it
every morning I use it every night and
my skin is improved so so much I won't
use this to wash my makeup off with I'll
use it when I don't have any makeup on
but I'll tell you guys about that when I
do my skincare routine those are kind of
the two main products that really helped
clear out my skin I also started to
drink a lot more water because one of
the main reasons as I personally think
when my skin was so bad was because I
didn't drink a lot of water I was
dehydrated quite a lot of the time which
meant my skin was dehydrated and I ate a
lot of fast food which I'm now started
to cut out and the healthier that I've
eaten I feel like the better my skin has
got because I think is all around here
and up here is diet and that
don't guess what's there anymore which
means like I know it's actually improved
you know like I know my diet is help
drinking more water and those two
products have all helped it to become a
lot more smooth so like I said I
actually used to have extremely oily
skin and I also thought like that was
down teenager and just kind of all those
and stuff but he are here and especially
my chin would be so oily that I'd put my
makeup on and within half an hour it
would just sweat off like it was
horrible especially when I was in year
ten eleven like I do my makeup in the
morning and halfway through the day it
was just gone like it was rub off my
nose and then you see the redness and it
was just horrible and since using this
Garnier product this is really balanced
out my skin to the point I would say
actually don't have all your skill
anymore I would say don't get me wrong
like I still have some oil production
but actually say my skin has gone to
kind of normal skin and that was the
best feeling what I realized that my
makeup wasn't getting as oily anymore
and I didn't need all these different
powders because I was spending so much
money trying to get a proper setting
powder that was gonna keep my makeup in
place and now I've realized I don't even
need it because my skin is actually kind
of normal I still use powder because I
like it but my skin has gotten so much
better in the morning to do my skincare
routine all obviously wake up I'll have
no makeup on and I will use this face
wash that I was telling you guys about I
just love it so much it's so refreshing
it's like a gel like a black kind of
boat it's a clear black gel it's really
weird picks play sometimes as well if
I'm feeling like my skin needs that kind
of like extra rejuvenation I will use
the Nippon fab teen skin fix pore
blaster wash and this is the day wash as
you can see quite a lot of this gone I
really like this I wouldn't again uses
to take my makeup off I just use it in
the morning as it's very refreshing and
again this didn't worsen my skin but I
don't think it made it better it is kind
of like maintained it so this is another
good face wash that I do really like I
guess it did make it kind of better like
kind of toned down the redness a bit and
then once I have done all of that and
I'm about to do my makeup I would
mooster eyes and the moisturizer that I
absolutely love and I use in the morning
is the clean and clear
dual action moisturizer and this is an
oil-free one which means it's really
good
giving me any extra oil to my face and
this is a basically a brand new one
because my other one went out about a
week ago
it says moisturizes and helps to prevent
the spots and blemishes and it's by
clean and clear which is Johnson &amp;amp;
Johnson so it's really good it's very
natural it's a really nice smell as well
and it is so moisturizing like my skin
feels it's so fresh when I have this on
sometimes I feel like it can kind of
accentuate my spots a little bit more
and show them off a bit more which I
don't necessarily like but it's a good
one you know for like the morning and
the evening when you don't really like
want to use another moisturizer although
another moisturizer that I have recently
been loving so much and I'm gonna have
to order the full size is he taught
brighterdayz this is a mini sample and I
bought this when I was doing a Tarte
makeup order because I'd heard a lot
about their skincare products now the
only thing I don't like about this is
that it's a highlighting moisturizer so
it's kind of got like the shimmery tones
if you're putting that on at night
before you like not doing your makeup
and stuff it doesn't really make a
difference but it's so moisturizing and
I feel like this has actually calmed
down the redness on my skin and my skin
is starting to look 1 skin tone instead
of kind of having red blotches on my
chin t-zone here basically my forehead
fix it in comparison to this like the
price is very different this was like 15
pounds and this is like 2 pounds 50 and
obviously the size of the tubes are very
different but I feel like this one is
better but then I'm paying a lot more
money for it but this one has really
helped as well but it's a proper good
dupe for this mask wise there's not
really many face masks that I like to
use because I feel like they actually
make my skin worse but a range that I do
think is really good and does help if
I'm having a really bad breakout is the
body shops tea tree it's 3 and 1 wash
scrub and mask
I wouldn't necessarily let this sit on
my face but I pour it on use it as a
scrub and I really scrub it into my skin
leave it for maybe one to two minutes
and then wash it off but this has helped
my spot so much dry skin is calm down so
much as well there's really not much
left in this tube but the TT race and
the body shop is really good if you have
oily skin or very spot prone skin with a
lot of blemishes and a lot of oil
something that I've literally added to
my skincare routine in the past I'm
going to go for week has been this
the brand-new L'Oreal Paris smooth
sugars clear scrub and this is good for
blackheads and so is this because I have
a lot of blackheads and my skin is very
prone to them so I really like this so
it's not exactly a mask it is more of a
scrub and it's kind of like this very
bright green kind of looks like a mashed
up Kiwi but it smell was so it smells so
fresh and so good and therefore out a
few of them there's almost four
blackheads and for like all your skin
that's why I got this one but they did
actually send me them so I do have the
others as well they're like coco scented
that's so good but this one is the best
one for me so far and I've used it three
times and it actually helped bring out
the impurities in my face so they were
out my skin and then it got better which
when I woke up I was like oh gosh I woke
up with more spots
I'm allergic but then the next day they
were gone so it basically brought out
the impurities in my skin and made it so
much better so a hundred percent I would
recommend those and they're not too
badly prices when I think they're around
six to eight pounds in the evening I
don't actually like to wash my makeup
off with face wash I feel like it
actually kind of scrubs the makeup into
my skin and I don't like it and I feel
like a lot of people are gonna disagree
with me when I say I use face wipes to
wipe off my makeup besan is using these
face wipes this is where my skin has
been improving so I know that it's not a
bad thing for me so I've been using it
the t-zone shine control cleansing of
face wipes and these cleanse and tone
remove excess oil and reduce shine and
their 49p 425 now I know that these are
plays a massive part in reducing the oil
on my face because like I said I don't
really have all your skin anymore and
it's since I've been using these in the
last I same month so I pick these up for
home Barger and I literally picked up
another package today because as you can
see they're nearly all gone they're not
so like wet that your makeup just kind
of like smears all over your face you
literally need two at the most and it
gets all your makeup off and I can feel
it lifting off the excess oil and t-zone
is a really good brand like people kind
of put it off because it's kind of cheap
and they send it in cheaper shops but no
it's so so good I will wipe my makeup
off with these first and then I'll go in
with face wash it helps my skin more
than washing my makeup off with face
wash soap that like
for me but I really really like these
talking about kind of like no strips and
everything for no strips I really like
to use it the ones from beauty formula I
picked these up from home bargains
they're like one pound fifty for a pack
of six and these are charcoal cleansing
and poor strips and they put the
absorbent charcoal helps you remove dirt
grease and other pore clogging
impurities for clean up feeling skin and
I 100% agree
they're like black tinted because
obviously they are charcoal and when I
rip these up it pulls out so many of my
impurities it's so satisfying to see and
the other ones I will use for my chin
and my forehead are from botanical
choice and it says these instantly clean
clogged pores and remove blackheads and
help to tighten the pores I agree I use
these on my chin on my forehead once a
week and you get six in a packet and
again I get these from home bargains or
body care anywhere on our you tube drug
I think they're like one pound twenty
not right and they're so good I don't
think you need to spend so much money
because at the end of the day they all
do the same thing and I think these are
just as good as if I went and bought
some 20-pound ones I really really like
these either the ones that I always use
oh you did a lot in my vlogs I use it a
lot in my pamper routine so don't just I
would recommend all of these something
else I really like to use on my skin
that before I do my makeup and it feels
really refreshing is the avian facial
spray and it's basically a hydrating
water spray if I show you literally just
coax you see that and is that you just
like water it's so good it's really
refreshing and it makes my makeup gone a
lot easier so that's just another thing
I do like to use in my skincare routine
and then once I've kind of done that and
I've washed all my hands after doing my
skincare I will use the Garnier
ultimate blends restoring hand cream and
amber got this for me I think it was for
my birthday and I used it so much this
has actually nearly ran out like it
feels like there's so much in here but
there's not I've used it so much and
this is about three or four pounds and
it's non greasy non sticky and it's for
dry hands and after using a lot of
products you can kind of get dry hand so
I like to use that once I finish my
skincare so that is the end of this
video and that's basically how I've
managed to clear my skin and the
products that I've used I really hope
this is helpful and has kind of given
you a bit of an insight on how I've
managed to do it and how
giving you some inspiration on products
that you can buy but not without
spending like a load of money so I know
you all started so much if you enjoyed
it remember to smash a huge thumbs up
comment down below some other products
that you think might be really helpful
for me to use because obviously my skin
still isn't at its best but it's gotten
so much better but I'm always on the
lookout for new products but I love you
all so so much and I will see you on
Wednesday at 6 p.m. for a brand new
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
