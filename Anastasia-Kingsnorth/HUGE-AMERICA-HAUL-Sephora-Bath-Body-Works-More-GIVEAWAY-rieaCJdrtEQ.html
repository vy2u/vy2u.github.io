back with one of the most exciting
videos ever and it is my America haul
finally after years of wanting to go I
got to go to America this summer I went
to Florida and I got to go to the mall
at millennia which is the best shopping
mall I've ever been into literally it
does not compare to anything we have in
England and the shops there I just can't
so I have a bunch of stuff to show you
today I'm just going to get straight
into it because there is so much but I
have drugstore makeup Sephora makeup and
then bath or Body Works so I really hope
you enjoy it and let's get started so
starting off with Sephora the first
things I got when makeup brushes now I
actually had a huge horror story with
these and I found poo on them in my
hotel room so I'm gonna be doing a story
time on that I will completely explain
it all with my snapchat stories like as
it was happening but yeah so these are
the brushes finally clean of the poo but
they're from wet and wild I got the
blush brush the crease one the large eye
shadow one and the contour one and these
were all 99 cents each we would just not
get these in 99 cents here like it just
would not happen and the quality of
these brushes look amazing and I see
them all over like the Instagram of
goals makeup account so I thought I
would give them a try while I saw them
in Walgreens I love them I also picked
up the Maybelline instant anti age
rewind concealer because Emily Canham
talks about this and she said it's
really good that she goes hurts from
America because of the shades so I
thought I would try it and it looks
really good so I'm very very excited to
try this and this was eight dollars and
you pay eight pounds here but because of
the exchange rate it works out cheaper
then other things I got are also from
Wet n Wild and they are the mini Goleta
eyeshadows I suppose this one is doing
like it's caramel packaging and this is
called brass and it was 70 cents then I
paid ninety cents for these two but
these two are just like different colors
and I've got these two from Walgreens
this one from Target but I've heard very
good things about these from Jeffrey
stars so I wanted to give them a go as I
really needed like a pigmented glitter
eye shadow and
nonsense how can you go wrong that's
like what 60 70 P moving on to Bath and
Body Works this is like my life in a
shot like when I walked in the smells
and just everything like it was all
exactly what I thought it would be the
better like you can't like they need to
bring it to England I was so lucky when
I went and they had a sale on the
candles so the ones that are nowhere to
be $24 are worth $12 so I bought one
because I had enough weight in my
suitcase so I got pumpkin pecan waffle
and I loved it because it had like a
copper lid on top I smells so good this
is actually gonna look so good in my
room I see these all over tumblr and I'm
one of them for so long but if you buy
them from like English places that
shipping is ridiculous so oh my god it
smells insane like I don't even want to
burn it because I'm that much in love
with it but yeah they had all of them to
choose from and were $12 5000 i then
bought another candle and this is an
adorable mini one and it was four
dollars fifty and it just this one in a
little like mason jar and it's got the
good doughnut on top and it's called
cinnamon sugar donor and it has a copper
lid again and it just smells so good I
love cinnamon like this smell of
cinnamon and this is genuinely amazing
though when I saw this it was in like
the travel size bit i literally just i
couldn't like it this is what you dream
of if you have a tumblr room i love it
so much i just want to keep selling it
that was only four dollars 50 why even
of course i had to pick up some of like
the other bath and Bodyworks bit so I
picked up three of the minis because it
was three for $12 and I feel like the
big ones are quite expensive for what
they were Anna wouldn't really get much
use out of them so I just bought a
matching set of three minis so the scent
is marshmallow pumpkin latte so I've got
the fragrance mist I got the 24 hour
body cream and then I got the body
lotion and these smell so good like oh
my god that is insane like I'm going to
use this as hand cream more than body
cream because I will say I bought the
body lotion but like the spray as well
like the stuff that is so scented and
you can tell it's genuinely gonna last
on your body which is something that
sometimes we can struggle with here in
England but I literally love these and I
thought
a really good bargain for three for $12
what's that like three four nine pounds
of like three pounds each they basically
soap &amp;amp; Glory mini price but I just love
these so much and of course how can you
go to Bath &amp;amp; Body Works without buying
hand sanitizers so of course I had to
buy some of the pocket backs so the
first one I got was Oh donut even and I
was looking on the website and I knew
that I wanted this one so I was so happy
that they actually had it I then got
boardwalk vanilla cone which is one of
their summer scents I then got
watermelon lemonade which I just love
the smell of this and then I got I do
not care which again I loved and then I
got warm vanilla sugar I really wanted
it been in a berry sorbet and
marshmallow pumpkin latte but they
didn't have them which I was really
upset about because they were the two
that I kind of like went out there
knowing that I wanted to get so I was
quite upset when I couldn't find them
because I went into to Bath and Body
Works and I still couldn't find them but
for five or six dollars you can't go
wrong and finally we have Sephora which
is like so far is like a Graceland for
like a makeup obsesses if that makes any
sense at all like if you like makeup you
would love to fora
so the first thing I bought is literally
something I'm so excited for and is the
Anastasia Beverly Hills glow kids I've
seen these everywhere and I've wanted
one for the longest time
so finally going I got mine in that glow
because I feel like people always get
the same one but I just feel like the
shade in that weren't really me so oh I
bought this one which I really like and
I love the package injury ombre is
really sleek then you open it you can
like i've swatched these already as you
can see but they are so pigmented like
the only way probably won't get as much
you salvage this one purely because it
is really dark but these three shades
here are like my perfect shades and that
I love about it as I was like you can
take the panned out and put new ones in
so I thought that's a really good idea
and I think this was $40 which for me it
was worth paying because I've always
wanted to same from Anastasia
of course I then had to pick up a
classic and it is new tart tartlets in
bloom palette the packaging of this just
it had me as soon as I saw it it was
mine as soon as I was like I am here I'm
buying that this was $45 but I would say
this is so
money because the packaging is gorgeous
it's right up my street it's all like
copper and gold on the back then you
open it and it's like the most gorgeous
palace to ever exist it has like a
burgundy which I've wanted for ages it
has these gorgeous like shimmery shades
it has the perfect matte shade the only
change I probably won't use are like
these two here but I could use those for
eyeliner or whatever but this palette is
so worth the money I cannot even and the
pigmentation of these eye shows as well
like and it's I feel like it's really
travel friendly because of how thin and
compact it is I guess I just imagined it
being a lot thicker than this but I
don't know I love it I then bought
another classic which a lot of you
tubers get and it is the Becca Jaclyn
hill champagne pop highlighter I have
wanted this for little this time as well
and I went back into Sephora a few days
before we left and I was like I'm gonna
have to buy it it was $40 but it's so
beautiful like I'm not a huge fan of
packaging but then when like you look at
the product no you just you can't even
like I'm gonna swatch it on my hand for
you can you see that on my finger like
it was so pigmented it's unbelievably
pigmented and the color is just gorgeous
like to me that was worth $40 to you it
might not be but that was worth it plus
I love the box as well like I love all
these YouTube collaborations they're so
good
I then bought the Too Faced melted matte
liquid lipstick in child star and I had
this oil in my recent Instagram selfie
this is what everybody was asking and
yeah this is it I love the packaging of
these they're really sleek they're
really easy to apply they last all day
and they're not like drying which is
weird actually because there's a lot
matte lipsticks ironed that are very
drying but this is not at all and it's
the perfect nude shade and I just love
the packaging I kind of said that they
it's just perfect and I think I paid $21
for this and the final thing I got is
from Anastasia again and it's the
Anastasia Beverly Hills at liquid
lipstick in milkshake this is a really
popular shade to get and I really wanted
to get it because I've seen so many
people have it and I've actually wore
this once I used it to do an ombre lip
on my Kylie Jenner lip kit
candy cane and it worked so good I love
this it was $20 and the packaging is
really nice and sleek again it's just so
gorgeous like I love Anastasia products
I've just fell in love as she always did
pick up a few other thing too in Sephora
I just got some of their face masks
because again I heard a lot of good
things about these for loads of
different people so I got the rose face
mask the Rose lip mask and the Lotus
sleeping mask I'm also doing a giveaway
