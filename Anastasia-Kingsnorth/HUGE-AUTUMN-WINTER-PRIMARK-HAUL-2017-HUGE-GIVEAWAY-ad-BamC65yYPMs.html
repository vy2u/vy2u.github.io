you guys are excited and now I'm going
to go on to this absolutely massive
Primark haul but I mean its massive I
mean I have two big bags for so I
you know where to start so let's just
get into it the first thing I can see is
a big Primark throw and this isn't
actually for me this actually for my mum
if you guys saw my day vlog where we
were flocking in Primark you see that my
memory you wanted this so I just picked
her up here
and it is basically a navy soft throw me
my mother love Primark throws we have
them all over the house I've got two on
my bed we've already got about three
downstairs and mums had about three or
four on her bed and this was only four
pounds yet was only four pounds perfect
for the winter really fluffy and really
cute so we picked up this I then picked
up another cushion now I know my
Christian obsession is literally out of
hand already and I know probably should
have picked up another cushion but it's
basically this one and it's like a lion
icky pinky colour with rose gold edging
and now I'm pretty sure you'll be able
to see the rose gold edging I was really
unsure so whether I should buy this it
was four pounds and I was like you know
what a girl can never have too many
cushions and this one's super super soft
so for four pounds I knew I had to pick
this up it's a really like autumn II
wintery color as well which is nice and
I'm just gonna save this and then you
like December time to put out on my bed
but yeah four pounds what a bargain I
then picked up a pack of t-shirt brass
because prop bars are actually amazing
so this is a t-shirt 3-pack of bras and
these are only eight pounds so you've
got a kind of pinky salmony lacy one a
white lacy one and then a kind of nudie
Brown at lacy one and I thought this was
incredible for eight pounds and where
else can you get three really good
quality brass at this price obviously
I'm not gonna do a trial clip of these
but they look amazing I'm very excited
to wear these at the majority of my bras
are from Primark so I would not fault
them from underwear is amazing so yeah
I've got these I then picked up another
pair of pajamas because if you guys saw
my previous
Primark haul I picked up this like six
pound set of pajamas and I'm if you
lived in them and they're honestly
amazing so I picked up another set and
these are 3/4 sleeves pajama sets and
yeah there were six pounds they just
look like this they are like this Navy
top and then you kind of got this as
techie tribally print on the trousers
which are again like black and white and
for six pounds I was like you can't
really go wrong like they're dramas
there's pajamas really everybody's like
why do you say JA
I know it's pajamas but just where I'm
from we just say jamás yeah so this is
just the 6-pound pajama set I really
like these so I'm very excited to wear
them fine then picked up a bag now this
is the first like I've bought since
buying my bag from vista village I
really didn't want to buy another bag
but then I was like you know what I need
kind of like a side bag because I'm
going somewhere which you guys will see
in my vlog tomorrow when this goes out
but yeah I'm going somewhere that needs
a bag for it so I basically bought this
kind of new dish where somebody nude
actually it's more like like you pink
fluffy bag so this is faux fur of course
and then you just open it up like this
and you've got loads of room it was
seven pounds and then on the tag it says
as seen in Glamour magazine so these
were obviously seen in Glamour magazine
this was 7 pound and I really like it
it's very different I think it will go
with my outfit that I'm wearing I'm not
too sure that yeah it's just got a long
strap and I really like it was only 7
pounds and cry out bags aren't really
good quality I used to knit feet and
live by them so I picked up this just to
where I'm more dressy a date with my
outfits and I also thought it was very
wintery as well because it obviously the
faux fur and it's super super soft as
well and I've just realized it actually
like kind of matches my cushion so now
my bag is gonna be match to my bed I
then picked up a pair of shoes because
again I love Primark shoes they're
really good for just kind of slipping on
if you're just going out the house so I
just picked up this pair and it's kind
of like I don't really know how to
describe them they're like pink with
mini holes in and they kind of not
really like plimsolls but just slip on
shoes he's what only I think they were
only 5 pounds yeah these are only 5
pounds and mine's just in a size 4 just
in case you wanted to know but yeah
they're just white with like pastel pink
detailing and just got holes in so that
would be really comfy but yeah I just
picked up a pair of these just kind of
when I'm running like errands and stuff
or just going to any trip to Tesco which
you guys don't know if I like you see my
daily vlogs but yeah love these and
these are only 5 pounds I then picked up
a bubble hat because obviously it is
coming up to winter and it's going to be
really cold and stuff so I thought it'd
be really nice to pick up a winter's hat
so this one it was three pounds and it's
just gray with this kind of whitey-brown
faux a bauble on the end so if I put
this on its gonna mess up my hair but I
really want to show you guys oh my god
how stupid do I look right now
I promise it's actually
cuber sort it out properly but I really
really like it and I feel so like wintry
and like cozy it's really warm it's
quite tight on my head well but it's
really really warm and this is only
three pounds so definitely recommend
Primark hats I then picked up some
underwear because obviously as I said a
little primer underwear so I picked up
this Navy pair of like lacy intricate
knickers I guess they're called I've got
these in a pastel pink and I thought
they're really nice in the duck egg blue
so I just picked up these at four three
pounds and you can get the matching bra
as well and then I forgot I'd actually
bought this this is a succulent so it's
kind of got like a grey ceramic pot with
this pink kind of succulent in it and I
thought this would look really cute
maybe just something on my shelf or
something I needed a new succulent
because if you guys saw my vlog again
I'm good how many times can I say that
my succulents actually fell out of my
pot and just went all over my bed so I
needed some new ones even though this is
fake but it was only two pounds fifty
and it feels quite heavy so it's quite
good quality but yeah just picked up
this in one room and then I bought my
first Christmas decoration for my room
because I just thought why not and it's
basically just a little rose gold
reindeer tea light holder it's never too
early the Christmas I know it hasn't
even been Halloween yet but it's coming
like Christmas he's like 68 days away
today I think so pretty good this is
only one pound fifty as well and I
thought that was just really cute behind
me for one of my like Christmas displays
that ground thingies when I do my
Christmas videos but yeah that was the
last thing I picked up and I loved it so
