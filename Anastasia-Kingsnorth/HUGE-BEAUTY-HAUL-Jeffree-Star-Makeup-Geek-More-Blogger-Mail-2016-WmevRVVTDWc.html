back and I may be doing a huge makeup
haul slash blogger haul so recently I
even sent a ton of stuff to my P o box
and I've been to events what I've been
given
a ton of amazing makeup so I thought it
was time that I did a haul but I just
want to say before I start all of this
stuff has been gifted to me I haven't
gotten bought it with my own money and I
know I'm so so so lucky I literally did
not expect to get any of this stuff and
I'm so grateful I am going to doing any
makeup haul with the stuff that I bought
because I recently went to Paris and I
recently went allotted from various
places so if I went to like places like
Sephora and stuff so I do have a ton of
makeup I've bought myself to show you
but today I went to a beauty event and
I've got given a ton of makeup as well
so mind blown so I thought you guys
might like enjoy seeing a blogger haul
as I love watching them I find them
really interesting and yeah I hope you
do the video and let's get started
so the first thing I will send each of
Urban Decay and I am an absolute love
with this and is the Urban Decay Naked
ultimate basics palette it looks like
this it has this gorgeous gold packaging
and you just open it up it has a huge
mirror and it has 12 absolutely gorgeous
shades now all of these are matte but
one of them has like a slight shimmer
undertone but as I said it is a complete
matte palette so top shades are
definitely much more me I thought the
bottom shades are very autumnal and kind
of like perfect for the time of year and
now yeah I just absolutely love this
palette it's so beautiful Urban Decay do
some really really nice shadows so when
I got this I was very very happy so
thank you Evan to keep that I love it I
then got home today to a parcel and I
had absolutely no idea what was in it
and it turns out it was from Too Faced
and I was so shocked I've dropped it on
the floor so two-faced
Abdo sent me their Christmas range so
they sent me the Christmas in New York
Marie macaroons palette which is
gorgeous as well in literally this
palette is so beautiful the only car I
probably won't wear is his purple one
just because I'm not that adventurous
but these shades are beautiful it
literally smells like vanilla
it smells so good and the palette looks
very expensive like how it's made
I don't know it's just absolutely
gorgeous I'm not really sure what the
retail price of this is but it also
comes with a mini better than sex
mascara so I literally love this thank
you to face to face then also sent me
three of these to face naughty kisses
and sweet cheeks gift sets and these
aren't little presents that you can give
to your friends or family so this one
has like a boss and dream lover blush
and lip gloss this one has milkshake and
baby love which is my favorite and this
one has a crazy in love and a lip
injection clear lip gloss so these are
really nice little presents to give to
your friends and yeah I love these this
news release definitely my favorite over
yeah I love those oh thank you so much
to face for those I cannot wait to try
all of these out now all of this stuff I
have now was given to me at an event
today I went to a beauty baby then where
I got to meet Jeffrey Stehr Manny anyway
and Patrick star which is into a dream
come true and I'm going to talk about
the first thing that I got given because
it's absolutely crazy so first thought I
got to meet Jeffrey star which is
amazing because I love his videos
so much and he actually gave me his
beauty killer palette I wanted this for
so long and he literally just handed me
it was like here have this these colors
are absolutely gorgeous and even though
they're not what I usually go for
because not that adventurous
I am going to give them a try I love
Courtney rich-bitch China white princess
and confession which I'm like these
three and then these two the others are
quite interest so I'm gonna have to try
them out but I really really love them
and the packaging is gorgeous they're
really big pans and the pigmentation is
amazing as well so how many matched you
get once you thing was its formats six
shimmers so I think that's a good ratio
I love this so much and yeah I just
can't even every time I look at it and
I'm like yeah he gave me that I've got
to meet Manny anyway which was again
incredible and he gave me his palette
which I just couldn't even this is the
makeup geek money MUA palette and this
is going to be my new favorite palette I
can just see this is me and a palette
this shade here is incredible it's a
mixture of blue and red but this
burgundy show
is what I've been looking for forever
it's a shade Mars and it's so gorgeous
these are the first makeup geek
eyeshadows I've ever had so I'm very
very tough with this and Manny was so
nice we literally we took some selfies
he had a chat and he was just lovely so
thank you so much for giving me this I'm
so grateful then the last like palette
type thing I have isn't really a palette
but then it is at the same time and
beauty they actually gave me a Z palette
I've never had a Z palette but I've
heard a lot about them and they're
basically just a little palette that you
open and you can put loose items in them
because you suck a magnet palette so
yeah I'm very very excited about this
because I was gonna order one anyway and
then I got given one so thank you today
makeup geek then gave me a ton of their
eyeshadows so this is a duochrome one
and this is in the shade I just dropped
it this is in the shade I'm a peach less
which is gorgeous and then I have two of
the foiled addiction ones as well this
one is in the shade and magic act and

original ones so I have the shade creme
brulee which is a classic from makeup
geek
