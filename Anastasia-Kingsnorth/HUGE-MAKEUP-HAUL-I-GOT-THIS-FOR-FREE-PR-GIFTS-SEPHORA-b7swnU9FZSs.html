today's video I am going to doing an
absolutely massive makeup haul I have
been very lucky to receive the most
amazing things in PR packages and have
also balls and things myself and I
haven't a makeup haul on my channel in
what feels like forever and makeup is
what we all love so I thought I would do
a massive makeup haul today that's
basically it
I've got stuff from high-end brands
drugstore brands and brands that aren't
even really makeup but I'm gonna show
you guys anyway because I love
everything it's so so so much you love
the halls let's do this as always I'm
just gonna throw a little disclaimer in
here I'm not trying to brag or boast I
genuinely so so grateful for everything
that I've received and I just wanted to
haul it to you guys because I think it's
amazing and it gives you ideas on what
you can buy so I really hope you guys
enjoyed this video if you do remember to
smash a huge thumbs up and let's just
get into the video I don't really know
where to start I think I'm gonna start
with some foundations because I'm super
excited about these so there's a brand
new makeup brand that is coming out in a
boots called ex1 Cosmetics and they
recently sent me the most insane PR
package I put it on my blogs because I
am back blogging a links down below
that's off promo and it was like a
massive pinata it was so so cool and
inside was some of their new foundations
so they sent me three shades three
shades of Tom Joad a vanilla shade I'm
gonna be so I've got a shade two three
and four here and I love the packaging
it feels quite luxurious I like the
copper lid as well it's more like an
orangey copper but I think it's really
pretty it looks as though you get a lot
of product in each pot so I'm gonna try
and shade three I'm just gonna pop it on
the back of my hand
as this is the middle shade so let's get
it pump in or I can feel it coming up
now so I'm just gonna blend a little bit
on the back of my hand just so I can see
that spreads far that spreads really far
and I've actually got makeup swatches on
my hand so if it covers it then we can
see the coverage I mean it shade 3 is
definitely too dark for me this would be
for when I have a tan I'm
gonna have to use shade too but that was
really good coverage it's covered two
swatches on my hand so amazing I'm not
really sure like what other products
this brand are coming out with but they
launched in boots on January 17th maybe
going to boots have a look but thank you
so much for sending me these because the
coverage is fab I love it and I'm really
excited to try these on my face next
I've got some more skincare bits from
urban decay and these came through the
post to me literally as I was about to
film this video so I was like perfect I
haven't actually had the chance to try
any of these out but these are the brand
new all nighter waterproof a full of
coverage concealers I've got the shade
light neutral fair neutral and fair
warmth so I think I'm gonna go with fair
warm just to have a look at because this
is kind of like again at the middle
shade I love that all-nighter packaging
Soho oh my gosh I love the all-nighter
foundation it's actually insane and look
the concealers are the exact same
packaging is the foundation but they're
just FRA pretty tiny is it a pump I
don't know it or is it not is it like a
stick I hope yes it's a stick oh my god
just excited okay so I'm just gonna
swatch a bit and that literally looks
like the perfect shade for me that
doesn't even look like warm that looks
more cool toned let's just blend it oh
my gosh that's a literally insane like I
don't know if you guys can see this but
on top of that foundation that would
give such a beautiful highlight Wow okay
I'm actually obsessed I'm guessing these
concealers are gonna be around 17 pounds
and honestly just to try that on my hand
100% recommend and I'm a sucker for
urban decay stuff anyway but that's
insane so thank you so much Evan to keep
sending these out to me re excited to
try them and I'll definitely try them
out in my vlogs another like base makeup
thing that I've got recently is
something on collection and it's the
connection lasting perfection green
concealer now if you've watched some of
my previous makeup tutorials you will
know that I love color correcting
because I have quite red toned skin and
it gets quite annoying so I do have to
color correct and green consumers are
amazing I often use the Urban Decay one
because that's just the one that I had
and then when I saw the collection were
coming out with the green concealer I
was like okay I love collection
concealer so this is definitely going to
be amazing so it's obviously the normal
prior to that I've seen a four-pound 19
I think it is anywhere maybe it's 5 but
I'm pretty sure it's 4 and
this is basically just a green concealer
and I think it's incredible I used it
today under this makeup look I used it
in my tutorial that well up on Sunday
I've used it maybe four or five times
because I'm just using my collection one
at first but if you do want to see like
how it looks on my face and stuff then
check out Sunday's makeup tutorial but I
really love it and it claims to be 16
hour wear and I do think it is another
amazing thing that I received recently
in my PA box is something from iconic
London and if you guys have seen on
Instagram which I'm pretty sure you have
they are very famous for their liquid
illuminators now I haven't actually had
the chance to try this out but I'm
really excited so I'm going to try on
the back of my hand you like squeeze it
up this little thing and then just like
pump it out but like it's such a
gorgeous shade so I guess I'm just gonna
try it on the back of my hand I don't
really know how this goes if I just pop
a bit on maybe and then it will just
blend it in
see what it looks like I have popped
this on top of foundation and concealer
but if you can see it but that's
gorgeous I think I would personally use
it as a base for powder highlight
because I do have oily skin like I've
said a thousand times and I feel like
liquid products don't sit well on me but
that's super super pretty this is in the
shade shine yeah I'm pretty sure that's
what it is but it's really really
beautiful so thank you so much iconic
for sending me out some of your
illuminators I really really like it and
I'm very excited to try this I just
realized I have another thing from Urban
Decay that I was lucky enough to receive
and I've been using this in my everyday
makeup bag and I spoke about it in my
vlogs this is the Urban Decay a
troublemaker mascara I really like this
car because I don't often wear lashes
unless I'm doing alright shadow like if
I'm not if I'm wearing eyeliner
I'll put lashes on if doing eyeshadow
I'll put lashes on but I'm like a
natural makeup day I would just stick to
normal mascara and this is the mascara
that I've been reaching for recently not
only is the packaging as so called it's
like this rainbow holographic the actual
mascara is so good and the wand it's not
like it's a plastic applicator it's not
fibers and I feel like I get along
better with plastic applicators it's got
shorter bits and then like longer bits I
don't know what you'd call them just the
little sticky bits that come out and the
quality of the actual mascara is
amazing like it's so so good I use it to
blend my eyelashes with my normal like
eyelashes today and it's just amazing I
love it so much I use all my bottom
lashes as well it curls them it gives
them volume and it makes them very black
like really really black so if you are
looking for any mascara this is one I
would definitely venture out to on the
first use it's quite clumpy but most
mascaras are but once you get into the
tube it's really really good another
brand that I am obsessed with that sent
me out something a few days ago is a
Beauty Blender and I am obsessed Beauty
blenders I actually lost mine and they
saw my tweet and they were like hey
we'll send you some so I was like thank
you they sent me five and they also sent
me another pink one but I just opened
that because I am a makeup up because I
needed to check my other one out because
it was dirty
I lost my real Beauty Blender so I was
using my Real Techniques one wasn't
pretty
so they sent me two of the full-size one
so I've got the classic cerise pink one
and then the nude one and then I've got
a mini grey one and two mini green ones
Beauty blenders are amazing I feel like
they make such a difference with your
makeup if you aren't into makeup that
much then Real Techniques sponges I just
draw it on the floor and cheaper sponges
are really good but Beauty blenders are
really good if you really want to get
the flawless look because obviously they
are about 16 pounds 52 by each which you
know that's not cheap but the quality of
the sponge is amazing and when they're a
little bit damp when you're blending
your foundation it makes a massive
difference
I've never brands that sent me some
things recently which I'm really excited
about because I absolutely love their
stuff is the gypsy shrine and the gypsy
shrine are kind of known for like their
body gels and like their glitters and
they've sent me a ton of body gems and
they also sent me a ton of glitters
so I'm obsessed with glitter and these
are going to be perfect for festival
season obviously festival season it's
not for a while but you know stocked up
so they sent me this gorgeous rainbow
pink cosmetic glitter this is just made
up of like tiny tiny hexagons then they
sent me the chunky silver one which has
got like big stars little stars kind of
it more like a chunky glitter then they
sent me the ice queen one at which she's
kind of like holographic silver and
white and again this is quite chunky
it's got a lot of like big bits in it
there's mostly made up oh my god why did
I just do that that is gone
oh oh my bad no it's gone all on my bed
and now I'm gonna have to move in my bed
I really didn't want to do that but I
still love the glitter and then the
other two they sent me the iridescent
diamond one and the chunky pink one
which I'm now not gonna open because
it's gonna go all on my bed I feel like
I'm just gonna have to like well there's
so much although it's gone under my
duvet another brand that has sent me
something recently which I'm absolutely
obsessed with I think it's amazing and I
love the story behind it is two-faced
and they sent me this palette here but
no exactly sure what it's called is it
called the clover palette because Jerrod
I've done is a second name but he's like
a really high-end but two-faced he has a
dog called clover and this is what this
palette is based around and how
beautiful is this palette it's a very
out-there palette like I feel like
you're really gonna have to wear this to
maybe like a festival or maybe like an
evening because obviously you've got a
wide variety of shades in here but you
can also create really good daytime
looks because you've got these nude
brown shades here this gorgeous one
called wet kiss I love that but like the
blue the yellow the purple that you've
got the pops of colors in there then you
need to get in a corner for your outer
corner you can really create a vast
amount of looks and this shade puppy
eyes the white one is so good that's so
so pigmented I'm really interested
because I've only used its palette once
that purple is really nice as well
and that's want to swatch the yellow to
see how pigmented yes the yellow is
really pigmented as well oh my gosh the
yellows really pigmented I feel like I
would love to do a makeup tutorial using
the yellow color so if you would like to
see that then let me know down below
I feel like that would be a really cool
look to do with maybe like an orange but
yeah thank you so much to face for
sending me this palette out I loved it
so much it coming the cutest packaging
it has like badges in there and like a
cuddly toy and stuff it would really
really cute so thank you this is the
last thing that I've got Senate then I'm
going to show you guys some other things
that I have actually bought so recently
I've been super super super lucky to
receive some makeup from Dior now I was
so shocked I've
had two parcels from them and I was like
so the first one that came in this
gorgeous little box and it says Dior lip
glow new glow squad and believe me and
they package this and good
it had like do your ribbon around it and
I've like kept the ribbon so I'm going
to show you in this box
I was just a mind blown when this come
through the post I'm like I could not
believe it do seven yet so this was like
the ribbon then it had around it was all
pink and white and it was also beautiful
they've sent me a letter and then inside
pass the pink tissue paper you get five
gorgeous new lipsticks so I've never
actually tried anything from Dior like
Beauty before never had anything from
Dior so it's really really exciting so
this is in the shade 0:10 a hollow pink
and it's just like this gorgeous
holographic pink shade so let me just
watch this on my hand
they're very sheer because they're quite
lip balm me lip gloss you type things
that the packaging is so luxurious and
obviously you would expect it to be from
Dior but it's so so luxurious so we've
got shade number for shade 102 shade
number eight and shade number 101 I
thought I'd write too because it's like
a dark
cerise pink is actually gonna be a
really nice gloss yeah that's a really
really pretty glass I really like that I
never normally wear glasses or like a
lip balm me things are normally six and
matte so I thought this is gonna be a
really good change for me and I'm really
excited so thank you so much do you all
for sending me this out I cannot believe
it and then a few days later I received
another parcel and they've sent me the
foundation and concealer and it is the
forever under cover foundation and any
forever under cover concealer not only
is the bottle on this insane I tried it
out in my vlog for the first time I
loved it so so good the hair is the
bottle is like a plasticy squeezy bottle
because obviously when you undo this the
lid squeezing so it is really cool and
then it's just got that it's your on top
and it's really good coverage like
really good coverage and then this can
see the bottle just like how gorgeous
says do your Ian it feels so luxurious
and the coverage is amazing so thank you
so much to your if you do you want to
see what they look like on my face and
even head over to my vlogs and then did
the first
impressions then I don't if you guys saw
but a few months ago I went to Paris and
I bought some things from Sephora the
first thing that I bought was some of
their face wipes these are the charcoal
exfoliating wipes and I just heard a lot
about them I just really wanted to try
them if it's sitting in my journal it's
like oh yeah I'm gonna hold them but the
only thing is this white bit here it's
stuck so hard nobody can actually pull
it up so what I'm gonna have to do is
I'm gonna start using them cut this open
here I was so upset and I actually tried
to order some more the Sephora website
it's for our website no longer ships to
UK I don't know what's going on with it
maybe it does now but last time I
checked it didn't it was really weird
the last two things I've got to haul for
you are foundations so the first one is
the Rihanna Fenty beauty foundation I've
got this again was also seen Sephora and
the shade that I got is one at 70 and
it's in the pro film - foundation really
good match I have it on today I used it
in my latest makeup tutorial which will
be linked on screen and down below but
it's very good coverage I mean you get a
lot of product in the bottle the only
thing that I would say is it's quite
thick and for me I like a bit more of a
runny consistency like something that I
can squeeze onto my face and it will
kind of run down because I want to blend
it really easily really quickly whereas
this was a bit more thick and a bit more
harder to get round the edges but it was
a really good foundation I think it's
really worth the money and I will use it
the other foundation that I bought that
kind of looks a bit worse for wear but
it's actually insane is the Marc Jacobs
foundation it did have a black lid on it
somehow managed to lose the lid but it's
okay because then it was massive anyway
like it was bigger than the bottle so it
just saves space in my makeup bag the
only thing I don't like about this is
the applicator because it's like this I
would have way preferred a pump but the
coverage on this foundation is so for
that I'm pretty sure if I had a solid
like a black circle just a solid black
circle on my face if I put this
foundation on top of it it would cover
it and you wouldn't be able to see it
through that's how full coverage is I am
obsessed with this foundation I would
recommend it to anybody it's quite
expensive I think it's about 40 pounds
of bottle but if you were looking for
like investing your money into a really
really good foundation then this is the
one I would go for that one recommended
it to me when we went into
for her and I was really skeptical
whether to buy it or not because
obviously her skin looked amazing but it
was 40 pounds I was like that's so much
money for a foundation when I just
normally use drugstore foundations but
it was the best purchase I've ever made
and I've used it every day since and now
I used buy a new one so I love it that
is the end of this video I really hope
you guys have enjoyed it if you didn't
remember to smash a huge thumbs up let's
see if we can smash 10,000 thumbs ups on

makeup you have been buying recently I
