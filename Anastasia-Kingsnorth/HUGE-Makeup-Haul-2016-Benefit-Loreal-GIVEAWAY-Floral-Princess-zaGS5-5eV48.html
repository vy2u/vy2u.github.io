going to be doing a huge makeup and
beauty haul so I recently went drugstore
shopping last weekend and then this
weekend I checked my PO Box and I'd
received some amazing things from a few
brands so I thought I will show you what
I got I also thought it would be really
nice to do a giveaway in this video so
at the end are you doing two giveaways
I'm you're doing a high-end and
drugstore one for one of the giveaways
and then another giveaway well you're
gonna have to wait and see so I'm just
going to get straight into the whole
because I really feel like I talked
about the product in these videos I
really feel like I connect with you I
don't know why my whores I really like
filming and I've read for like you guys
love them a lot and they're talking
videos chatty videos so you really get
to know me ish and you guys really like
them so I'm just going to get straight
on it with the drugstore portion of this
video because this is mainly what the
haul is I mean I went drugstore shopping
so I'm just gonna get straight into it
so I first of all went over to the
L'Oreal counter because last Saturday
morning when I actually went shopping my
love your true match foundation ran out
and it was the old formula so I had to
go pick up another one so I got the new
formula of the True Match and I haven't
tried this yet I today I usually
Bourjois healthy mix which isn't my
favorite I much prefer this but as I
said I haven't even opened this yet I
still haven't tried it I'm really really
excited to though because a lot of you
have said good things a lot of people
have said it's more runny no I'm not
sure because obviously I haven't tried
it but I'm really excited and the old
formula was my literal favorite
foundation I wore it everywhere it was
the only thing that really set it on my
skin so I'm really excited to try this
and I hope it meets my expectations it
was only ten pounds as well which is
really good for a good foundation and
the bottle is a really decent size too
so there's not really much I can
complain about to be honest I mean it's
amazing but I just love it
the next thing I picked up is from but
it's not I think it arranged it might be
arranged actually it's called the color
riche la palette and I got the nude one
and this is a new thing that's come out
so it's just this golden palette and
it's really reflective but I really like
it and as I said I got the nude palette
because I do it in red and they do it in
dude as well so it just looks like this
it just has an array of six gorgeous
gorgeous nude colors these three here in
the middle were definitely my favorites
I feel like they're much more me but I
still love the other ones and I'll mix
them together and use something like
highlight and shades and everything I
really really like this palette and it
also comes with a nice a process here
pleek a brush to apply it with and I
just really love this palette also comes
with a really good sized mirror so even
though this is 13 pounds I trust L'Oreal
products I know they're really good and
I always use L'Oreal actually I use it a
lot so I definitely had to pick this up
as I love the color each lipstick so I'm
very excited to try this and I actually
use the bottom shade today that's what
it's got a bit of identity I just put it
in the middle of my lips and I really
like it it's not too dark it's not too
light it's just perfect
and I love this I then picked up the
L'Oreal Paris blush sculpt trio
contouring blush this is their new
infallible sculpt range and I haven't
actually used this yet but I really love
it so the packaging to me is really
interesting because as you can see it's
super flat and the prototype doesn't
come out on top of the packaging it's
just like completely flat and then all
the product is deep inside and I just
love it there's a more soft rose color
than there's a darker rose color
and then there's a pinch toned running
on the middle and I'll do a close-up so
you can see but I really do like this
and I think this was eight pounds so
that is a bit more pricier for drugstore
blushes but it's a really good blusher
from what I've seen online so I
definitely a speak what up I then went
over to the seat counter because I
really really wanted this after watching
a review on YouTube
and it is the sleek makeup map to me
ultra smooth and lip cream I got mine in
the shade birthday suit because nude lip
colors are the ones I prefer the most
I think they suit my skin touch skin
tone the most their skin color I don't
know what's happening to me today
but I really like this as I said this is
in the shade birthday suit and it's not
drying at all it's really smooth and
soft to apply and then after around a
minute a minute a half it will just
completely dry matte and I think I wore
this for around 7 hours and it didn't
flake once so this is probably the best
matte lip products I've found other than
matte
lipsticks in velvet teddy but this is
really good and it was only five pounds
so if you are looking for a cheaper
alternative of maybe a matte matte
lipstick I would definitely recommend
these ones and there's a load of
different shades as well I then picked
up something that zombie actually got in
her boots haul and it was the 17 easy on
the eye birthday suit palette so this is
gorgeous in Zoe's video and I hadn't
actually never tried 17 products before
I just always skipped them when I went
into boots and I don't really know why
but it looked amazing so I definitely
had to try it so it just looks like this
it just says easy on the eye and then
when you open it it comes with a really
decent sized mirror and it comes with if
I would if I could like cover the mirror
I would but it comes with eight matte
shades well they're not matte shades but
eight powder shades and it also comes
with for cream so this is a primer then
there's just three cream highlighters
and there's a load of eyeshadows two of
them amount and then six of them are
shimmers and I really love this palette
another thing I love about it is the
brush because it comes with a brush that
you can pack all the eyeshadow on with
and then a fluffy blending brush which
is a lot better to the soft padded
brushes that come in most palettes
nowadays from the drugstore so I really
loved this palette and it was only 8
pounds as well and I feel like it was
really worth it because it wasn't just
matte eyeshadows and it wasn't just
shimmery eyeshadows I like how they
included a primer and the cream I just
really liked it and for eight pounds I
thought that would be really good I have
it on today I only use one of the colors
but I really like it and definitely
recommend this so the final thing I
picked up from the drugstore was
something from simple and it is the
simple limited edition kind of screen
cleansing facial wipes in the pink
version so I always use this out cleanse
and polish to wash off of my eye makeup
with but I don't want it like I realized
that my eye lashes are starting to fall
out and I don't want to keep scrubbing
at my eyes
so I thought that before I use my skin
care and everything like that in the
bathroom I would just wipe off my eye
makeup to stop like irritating my eyes
because as I said my eyelashes are
falling out rapidly and I think it is
because I'm scrubbing them so hard to
get like the mascara off and everything
so I thought this would be really good
to just keep in my makeup drawer or like
my skincare drawer and just to get my
makeup off with before I actually go to
wash it off so there
the product is more getting deep down
into my skin is head of just washing the
top layer off I just thought this would
be really good and these are only 1
pound 50 I think so
that's a really good bargain and you get
25 in there so it will last me about a
month and I really like it so the two
final things I have to show you in this
hall are from benefit and they actually
sent these to my PO Box and I was so
excited I screamed when I opened it
because I was just so excited and this
is the benefit the pore fessional mat
rescued so this is the new benefit
product that came out in January and I
was so close to buying it anyway because
I have really oily skin and within
around 4 hours my oil will sweat through
my makeup I feel even less to be honest
and I needed something that was going to
try and stop that and I put this on
every day under my makeup now I got it
on Tuesday and I wore it every other day
oh I've noticed I didn't get oily at
school like I still got oily because I
just have so much of it but this
definitely dyed it down and I'm really
really grateful for that I believe this
ranges at around 25 pounds I could be
wrong but I'll link it down below I
really really like it and I would
definitely recommend it so thank you
benefit for that they also sent me to go
with it the Porefessional instant
wipeout masks which again after your
t-zone just here or you can use them on
your forehead and your chin and then
just rip out all of the blackheads the
impurities they leave it really soft and
smooth looking and it says their top
secret ingredient is actually mushroom
extract which is known to clarify pores
so so that was different I really like
how they look in size it just comes in
like this and it will like doctors case
type of thing and then you open the pack
and they all can they all just fell out
it look like this and you just have to
press this little blue bit down and it
injects the like I know the serum it
says pour serum into the mask here and
it makes it all ready and then used to
pop it on leave it and you're ready to
use and I just really really like this I
love the packaging it's so amazing and I
think this is a really good idea like
keeping them all separate any different
packs I haven't used one yet but I
definitely will and I will let you know
and like a night routine or a pamper
routine or something coming soon so I
say thank you to benefit for that and I
also receive some stuff from Urban Decay
Tanya burr cosmetic
and nails ink as well so thank you so
much they will be coming up in a hall
soon so now I'm going to move on to the
