going to be doing a huge huge huge
makeup and beauty haul
I've been collecting makeup dowell nosey
like collecting my whole makeup
collection but collecting this little
makeup since just before Christmas and
it's now February and I thought that
would be perfect time to do a makeup
haul as the drugs also actually been
really like get up there game recently
and there were some really really good
stuff in the drugstores at the moment
and I've been obsessed with it I
literally cannot believe the things that
have come out because I thought they
were only gonna be a rerelease be
released only gonna be released in
America I was so so happy to find that
they came to England and yeah I'm just
going to get straight into this video
because I don't want intro to be too
long because as I said there's a lot of
products to get through and I kind of
want to get straight into it so I hope
you enjoy the video and let's get
started so I'm going to start off with
the drugstore now I went into super drug
the other day and I saw the most amazing
thing that I saw in a few people's
videos in America and I really really
wanted it so I was so happy that I found
it and it is the Maybelline the falsies
put up drama push-up drama mascara
I love the packages this mascara it
basically right and pink and then you
just twist the red bit off and the one
comes out now the wand is incredible it
is kind of like that there you want but
the little spikes are a little bit
shorter now I only got this for six
pounds not down from eight pounds and it
was buy one get one half price I'm not
sure there I kind of always have like an
introductory offer all most of their
products and I managed to get this one
that offer was on for some reason I
thought it was going to be double ended
I thought I could twist the pink end off
as well I guess that's just to play on
my mind but this was karma is really
really good the only thing I would say
is though you have to curl your
eyelashes before you apply it like I
don't know when you need to curl my
eyelashes because my eyelashes are quite
long anyway
but I need to curl them with this
because it kind of makes them quite
short and stubby if I don't curl them
but if I do curl them this is an amazing
mascara and I would definitely recommend
it as I said it was buy one get one half
price so I also picked up the new
Maybelline Dream velvet soft mattes a
hydrating foundation I have this on
today and I think it is amazing I think
it's done wonders for my skin and I
absolutely love it I got one in zero one
natural and this was eight pounds I
think so I actually got the mascara for
three pounds which was amazing and yeah
as I said it's just a matte foundation
it is really really mad actually it
comes up on my hand-drawn map but the
only thing is it oxidizes quite quick on
your hand so you do have to apply it
straight away but I have really oily
skin and actually this doesn't let my
oil seep through as much as some other
foundation to do whether this is because
it's Matt I'm not sure it doesn't say
that it's oil free so I'm not too sure
but this is a really really good
foundation and it keeps my face hydrated
all day and I would definitely recommend
it now a few weeks back I have my
YouTube 100,000 subscriber party and so
even bought me presents which I really
didn't have to it wasn't that type of
party but people did bring your presents
also so grateful for and I was going
through them the other day and I think
this was bought me by Megan dip-dyed
daisy's if it is thank you so much if it
wasn't thank you to whoever bought me
this because my mum kind of mix them all
up before I open them by accident
because you can really carry them all
back to the car
but whoever got me this I think it was
Megan got me two of the other new
drugstore things and they got me the
Maybelline New York blender and I took
this out of the box this morning and it
was so good I used it to blend them to
my idea and it just fits perfectly in
the inner corner and it didn't get
orange at all like honestly my concealer
just went straight on my face there was
no excess I didn't have to wet it and I
love that there's a handle because
obviously you could get germs onto your
sponge if it doesn't have a handle and I
think that's what causes some of my
breakouts but this will I love it
because it does have a handle and it's a
decent size as else you can hold it in
your fingers and put your concealer on
or even foundation and I just love this
so thank you so much whoever got me this
and I'll definitely recommend it the
same person also got me one of the brand
new baby lips blushes so this is the
Baby Lips
bomb and blush in number one innocent
peach so it's quite cute it has a little
holder here and you can just twist the
plastic off and it's like a ball it kind
of reminds you an EOS lip-balm let me
just swatch it on my hand it's very like
peach I don't know how well you can see
that but it's really really like a
peachy tone color and it's very shiny
which I love and of course you can use
it
some cheats as well which I really like
and I think like when I get all four I
would love to put them lined up in my
makeup collection I really want the
nudie colored one because I think I
could use that it's more of a highlight
little blush as well which I really like
but yeah I absolutely love this again
thank you to whoever got me this and I
believe these are about five pounds to
buy at the moment stick it on the topic
of drugstore I also got another thing
which I bought and this is the Nivea
men's sensitive post shave balm now
obviously I am a girl and I don't shave
my facial hair however so many people
use this as a primer and I really really
needed a good primer because everybody
knows how worried I get absolutely
disgusting I don't know why I get so
early but yeah I saw this and you know I
was like no I'm going to try this
because so many people have it and you
get so much product in it it's
unbelievable and it's not like the
classic Nivea scent as well so your face
smells amazing when you put it on but
this is only three pounds and at the
moment it's good I mean it's not so
great for just under concealer because
that really caked up but under
foundation this works amazing on my skin
I use this on the night of my party and
it was insane because I always have
trouble again with oiliness makeup
slipping off my face cakiness not really
sure why but that just happened but this
primer is really helping that so I would
definitely recommend this now I'm gonna
move on to a lush thing I've got so this
is the lush fresh handmade cosmetics
cupcake face mask now I wanted to try
the lush face mask for so long or just
are so good and I finally bought one
because that's seven pound and you have
to use it was in three weeks and I find
it really hard to use lush products up
that quickly which is kind of the reason
why I hadn't bought one yet
but I absolutely love this it just
sounds amazing it has is to take out the
fridge apply corners go over the face
and leave for five to ten minutes and
wash off with warm water and it is so so
good
it's basically just made out of chakra
and smells like chocolate but it's so
good and it's teenage and oily skin
which is really helpful and it helps
calm down breakouts I would definitely
agree with that my breakouts have calmed
down a lot since me using this and even
though it is seven pounds and you have
to use it within three
weeks I would definitely recommend it
it's one of the most amazing phantom
assaults give us a partner next I'm
going to move on to a few Mac things
that I've recently bought so I recently
bought this when I went shopping with
Amber Feb birthday and I absolutely love
it and it is the mac cosmetics pigment
in rose I've never tried a Mac pigment
before and I was quite skeptical about
trying one because obviously pick their
loose pigments and you have to put
launched your eyes like loosely and I
was very very skeptical about buying
this but I'm so so glad I did it is such
a stunning color and when you lift it
off you can just see the sparkle in that
pot and it is amazing you get so much
peaking of pigment
I'm so sorry I cannot speak today you
get so much pigment for the money and
it's just gorgeous it just reacts with
the lie and I wore this on the knife my
party and my eyes I'm not being stuffer
but I loved how my shadow turned out it
just looked amazing for me anyway and I
absolutely love this and it was 16
pounds I then also picked up a lipstick
and this is the matte lipstick info
which is a satin finish and I have this
on today mixed with velvet teddy which
is my new favorite mixture and I love
this so much
the smell of MAC lipsticks makes you
just want to like these I'm not gonna
lie but I love this color I really want
to start collecting them more like nude
colors from Mac because they're the
colors I'm really liking at the moment
but for 15:50 I love MAC lipsticks I'm
getting quite a few of them now and I
would definitely do a swatch video soon
because I literally love these so much
okay so the final part of this makeup
haul is from Too Faced and I got so much
stuff from Too Faced recently I was so
so lucky and I've also got another two
things but I'm gonna save those for
another haul because I didn't want this
too hard to be like overly long so the
first things I got which I'm just in
absolutely love with a nice nearly
dropped it was the whole collection of
the brand new melted chocolates so if
you don't know what melted are they are
basically oh my gosh I didn't pick these
up very good these are basically melted
liquid lipsticks and I love these so
much and they recently brought out a
range that smells like chocolate and
they're all nude colors which is just
right up my street and there is three
and there is three like metallic colors
which I love and one of my favorites
actually this is my favorite if this one
and it is chocolate milkshake and I love
this so much and it smells like
chocolate they really do smell like
chocolate I just love you so much
that one's a matte one so it's this one
which is chocolate honey and so is
chocolate cherries those are the three
matte ones and then for the metallic
ones you've got metallic chocolate
diamond metallic frozen hot chocolate
and metallic candy bar and I just love
these so much
I am just so so grateful for these and
they're amazing and the final two things
I was very very lucky to get were the
Too Faced chocolate bar palette and the
semi-sweet chocolate bar palette I never
owned any of the chocolate bar palette
and I wanted them so bad and I finally
got them and I'm so so happy so they
just look like this look at the array of
colors this is the first one my favorite
shades or yeah Shea's a hazelnut creme
brulee and champagne truffle I
absolutely love these and of course it
smell like chocolate and you can
actually look and eat them as well so I
might have it with and then from the
semi-sweet chocolate bar my favorites
are coconut cream butter pecan bonbon
and pink sugar and as you can see
another gorgeous palette I absolutely
love these palettes I think there are
about 40 pounds each but they're just
gorgeous and let me just smell them
because oh so yes that is basically all
of my makeup I'm so so grateful for all
of this I cannot believe that I finally
got my hands on half of this and I
really hope you enjoyed this video I
love doing hauls there's some of my
favorite to film and I would definitely
feel more because I have some more stuff
to show you
I also have a lot of clothes I bought
but I'm always skeptical about filming
clothing hauls
I don't know why if you do want to see a
clothing haul let me know in the
comments below this video a huge thumbs
up if you enjoyed it and I will see you
in next week's video bye
