only doing a huge makeup haul and brand
new to the drugstore slash high-end
first impressions so there has recently
been a load of new Beauty launches
within high-end and drugstore so I
picked out some of the personal
favorites of mine and I decided to put
them all together into a whole to kind
of show you guys what there is on offer
at the moment and just so you can see
what is available so I'm not gonna lie
there's actually only two brands in this
video and this video isn't sponsored
it's just kind of how it's worked out so
I'm sorry about that but the products
are all brand new so I'm so excited to
share them with you so yeah I'm just
going to get straight into the video I
really hope you enjoy it and let's get
started so I'm going to begin with
drugstore and I'm gonna begin with the
cheapest thing and then go to the most
expensive so the first thing I've got
which I'm so excited for is the brand
new Maybelline Baby Lips pop art edition
so as you can see these are like pop art
the decorated Baby Lips and I love them
so much they were no more expensive than
usual Baby Lips there were two pounds
ninety-nine and this one is in
grapefruit zing and this was the
actually the only one they had and I
went into the store I wanted the pink
one but I'm actually really happy
because I love this one so much and it's
just kind of like a ready color when you
look at it and it is just so so pretty I
love the packaging it's so like I don't
know I just love it but I love cartoon
things cartoon things are very me so I
was so happy with her so you don't see
the drug website because I've got this
in store a super drug but on the super
dope website was like oh no too funny
when they're back in stock like they
won't even stock or anything so so happy
I got this and I would definitely I
always recommend baby lips baby lips are
my favorite lip balm and I've sitting
there amazing the next thing I picked up
is also from the Baby Lips range and
again I'm so excited about these these
are the baby nips lip gloss hydrant
range so these are the brand new baby
lips and lip glosses and I actually have
two of them from a swap box I did with
my friend
Ella when she was back in Florida but
these are the British version and I
believe that these are like different to
the ones in America maybe like I feel
like this is in a different packaging to
one that I already have and if it is I'm
gonna be really annoyed but it's in the
shade type with me number 20 and it's
just it's kind of a nude color you guys
know that I love like nude lip glosses
so that was my phone so they look just
like this and it's just like a nude lip
gloss each of so so pretty and seriously
I would like recommend these so much I
wore like the two arrows got me so much
and for four pounds 99 I really don't
think you can go wrong with these as you
get a lot of product and like baby lips
are just up one of my favorite things
ever I love them so much I could use
them all day every day the next thing I
have is the brand new Maybelline fit me
foundation and I believe this is brand
new because of the packaging it's in I
personally never had the fit me
foundation so I have no idea what it's
like but this says fit me matte and
poreless and it's for normal to oily
skin you could just imagine my face when
it's dead or your skin because my skin
is like a frying pan and you just go
sorry and I need a product that doesn't
make it go away Li and my baby I found
it I don't know this is in the shade 105
natural ivory so this is I think the
lightest shade but I'm so excited to try
this I mean it looks an okay color match
for me I hope it is anyway it was only
five pounds 99 which is a bargain for
foundation I think that's one of the
cheapest drugstore foundations you can
get if not the cheapest from Maybelline
especially so I'm so excited to try this
I don't know this has been released in
America before like the Baby Lips and it
glosses house I'm not sure America
beauty is in the same like I've never
been but they have them add amazing view
things from what I've seen so I don't
know how I got onto America there but
yeah this is the brand new foundation it
says it mattifies a refined pause with
blurring and micro powder supporters
looking skin so I'm very excited for
that hopefully it will have like a
natural seamless finish and yeah I'm
just so excited for that the next thing
I got is another lip
a Disney brand new Maybelline vivid
matte liquid lipsticks
so this is in the shade 0-5 nude flush
and it says go Rio on the front because
this is the Olympic Games range of them
like oh no you can buy them without the
stickers but I thought I'd buy it with
the sticker just kind of support the
Olympic Games I don't know but this is
such a gorgeous kind of like I'm gonna
swatch it on my hand that is the perfect
color I just love it so much it was
$6.99 so it kind of is expensive I'm not
gonna lie I thought I bought the tester
then because they had like a stick of
that I was gonna say oh my god I just
love it so much it is such a gorgeous
color and it looked the consistency
reminds me of the NYX lingerie lipsticks
and the consistency also reminds me oh
what I imagined the Kylie Jenner lip
kits to be like I still don't have one I
want one so bad but I still don't have
one because I just I'm not quick enough
on the website which is so annoying but
things I would say is a very close Joop
so I'm very happy that Maybelline
brought these out and news flash and
then like a dark purple was my favorite
from the range because there's a big big
range of shades in these but yeah I'm
loving these so far I mean I haven't
Warwick though you got it today but from
what I can see I think I'm definitely
gonna love this the final thing I bought
from Maybelline is probably one of the
most exciting things because I'm so
excited for this and is in Maybelline
New York brick bronzer and Myers in the
shade blonde so it looks like this and I
just think it's so beautiful I'm so
excited for this so you just open out if
I can open it and it just looks like
this and it's just a really big bronzer
and then it has this brick detailing
which is to do chains of pink and then a
light shade of like a Goldy bronze and
this was $7.99 this was the most
expensive thing out of all of the new
releases I have found so far but it is
so good like the pigmentation is amazing
and I've got mine in blonde because
obviously I do have blonde hair like
it's on the darker side but it is blonde
so I thought this would be amazing and
I'm just so excited to try this because
I'm getting more into like contouring
and bronzing recently so can you see it
and I've had my makeup on a day but I'm
so excited for this and the packaging is
well it's just gorgeous like the gold on
this
it looks Brown on camera but it's gold
so yeah I'm so excited for this amazing
now I have two new high-end releases
which I'm super excited about so Urban
Decay were nice enough to actually send
me the new house through the looking
glass like collection and I'm so excited
for this because I was the one done is
my favorite movie and I cannot wait to
go see Alice in Alice in I through the
looking-glass
in cinemas soon and this isn't sponsored
they just sent me I didn't even have to
show it but I just love the collection
so much so first one we talked about the
lipsticks so there is five lipsticks in
the collection so I just have all of
them here so I'm just going to show you
like one of my favorite ones which i
think is this Alice yeah well my
favorite ones it's Alex and I love the
packaging it's really like rosy and kind
of like makes you feel a bit ill when
you look at it type of packaging but I
love it I don't know it's so amazing and
then this is the lipstick I think the
packaging was so well thought through
and it's very like ivory I don't know
it's amazing and this is one of my
favorites change for me it's a very nude
shade and I just got on my dress it's a
very new shade like it might wash some
people out because it is like orange
toned but I'm going to mix this together
with other colors there's a load of
shades it's five shades there's a red
one which is really nice there's a dark
purple one there's a lighter purple one
and then there's like a dark blue shade
so these are like really out there
lipsticks but I feel like I'm definitely
gonna get along with them and I would
definitely get my use out of them so I'm
so excited for this collection like I
got so the final thing I have to show
you is so exciting and it is the brand
new Disney Alice Through the Looking
Glass palette this palette retails at 43
pounds which is why I'm so shocked that
they sent me it and I genuinely cannot
believe it I love it so much it's so
different and like crazy and like Mad
Hatter I just love it so much so you
open it out at the top here and the
packaging is so well thought through
it's crazy so you get this huge mirror
here that says we're all mad here and I
love that quote that's the Mad Hatter's
quote and it just looks like really
pretty
here and everything and then it says I
could quit here I'm not gonna lie I find
it really hard to read so I'm not in
their attempted but then you open the
little doors here and there's a
butterfly inside like all the hell and
you're like bend it up and everything
and it was just like stand up like this
and it's just so gorgeous so then you
just pop this down and you can shut that
and there that you get to the makeup and
it says I know who I was when I got up
this morning but I must have changed I
can't read that word but I must have
changed several times since then there
we go and then you open it up and say
hello to heaven this palette is probably
the most gorgeous palette I've ever seen
it just comes with all these shades and
I just can't get over it to be honest I
just think it's so gorgeous and the
packaging is so different I mean I
probably won't get use out the green
shades because I feel like greens really
my color but these shades here oh my god
it's just so bloody gorgeous I know the
names Looking Glass Hatter heads will
roll time Dutch's paradox metamorphosis
I just love them so much and this
palette is amazing you always come
through the brush but you're just so
both the wow it's like a mini dressing
table and what if you know I mean I also
