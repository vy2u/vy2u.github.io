back and I'm going to be doing an
absolutely huge Primark haul for seven
2017 yeah get in you're following my
vlog channel you would already know so I
went to quite recently and I did a huge
Primark shop and I was like you know
what I'm not going to do a vlog on my
second channel I'm going to do a haul on
my main channel I think I just said blog
I'm in a hall and I have to excuse
Nigeria for Primark stuff and I'm
surprised to get like dug into them
because Primark is not my favorite shot
ever I love it me and amber spent like
over 100 pounds in there and I have no
regrets I absolutely loved it so yeah I
was gonna go straight on into the video
I really hope you enjoy it and let's get
started so sign up at home where I
actually bought two home weddings or the
other one is like deep in the bag so
that will come later in the hall but I
bought this cushion no but I needed
another cushion because I definitely
don't
I've got like ten on my bed Firewise
another one and I found this one and
it's so cute it's just like pink and
fluffy and fluffy cushions are my
favourite so I have to buy it it was
seven pounds and I just fell in love
with it I saw this thing at Jordan lips
combi I think that's how you say
officers or if it's our product or and I
loved it so I have to go pick one up for
my bed because I don't know I just fell
in love with it and I thought so
empowered was such a bargain for that so
I definitely can't find the next home
bit so we're just going to go in a bit
of a random order but the next thing I
men bought is a makeup bag and nowadays
either makeup or toiletry bag I'm not
really sure you could use it for both
but it's basically just black and white
this side is black with white polka dots
and there's got the white and the
reversible size but it's really big it's
got a lot of room because I'm going away
on three different trips within the next
two weeks so I'm going to need a lot of
makeup and a lot of like toiletries and
stuff so I thought I better buy a food
bag that will be able to keep them all
in so I bought this as thought for four
pounds that was such a bargain so I
definitely could also know I think me a
number got matching if I remember
correctly the next thing I bought was
something I've heard a lot of people
rave about online that the reason I
bought them and it's the PS love face
white so these are the oil balancing
facial cleansing wipes for oily and
blemish prone skin which is 100% what
mine is I use two of these last night to
get my makeup off because quite frankly
fathers but literally they are so good I
just sat there i went to mirror i was
like well I make them all actually come
up and sometimes makeup wipes it leaves
a lot of residue still on the skin but
when I use another one to go over it or
I make up genuinely had come off so
these are incredible and they were only
a pound to two packs and you get 25
minutes packs for that 50 so that should
last me a good month month and a half
and I thought that's really good I'm
obviously not going to use them every
single day because that would be really
bad for my skin but just on light so I'm
super tired and stuff and like on trips
I thought that was really good for a
pound the next thing I have prymaat
actually sent me in the post a few days
ago and I don't know if they're
available in store yet but when this
videos out they possibly should be
because they are so worth the money so
they are these eyelashes and basically
the eyelashes that I'm wearing today
also from this collection and they are
the collection by Suzanne Jackson it's
going to be designed for Primark and
they are absolutely gorgeous I'm
obsessed with the eyelet line wearing
today and these are the debye lashes but
I've got the London Paris and New York
ones here but they also sent me all of
the other collection like all the rest
of them and I just I'm so grateful these
are incredible like make your own
judgments see if you like them on my
eyes but I really like them I thought
they're really good I will if you've got
no mascara or nothing nothing just my
lashes on so I've got these are
absolutely incredible and if so we need
to apply as well so I also relaxed
packaging definitely recommend the next
thing I bought me an amber also got
matching and we go because it reminded
us on Victoria's Secret I mean amber
going away on two holidays so we thought
we'd get matching Jarvis because of how
gold so we basically bought this pink
and white stripe II bedtime shirt and it
is a really really long shirt to sleep
in with little rolled-up sleeves and
this was only eight pounds I think it
was eight pounds from the drama section
and we're going to look so cute like
matching in these and we just really
wanted some matching dramas and to be
honest I don't really have like pajamas
anymore I'm really sorry according
Jarvis and other annoying people
pajamas I don't really have any matching
pajama sets anymore I just kind of check
on like random clothes I don't really
wear so to actually have some pajamas
makes me really happy the eddies are
really cute and the quality is amazing
as well amber try to head out last night
it was really comfy to sleep in so very
very excited to you that we then
or and get ready for the lighting to go
absolutely disgusting cur this white
we bought matching words why not robes
are so good I literally both of my roses
remark I have one from you doesn't two
from Primark but I won't buy a new one
for this little holiday and again this
is only eight pounds he doesn't have a
hood on it which is the only thing I'm
disappointed about because I love roses
hoods on because they make you feel
really cozy but this is so nice if you
just plain white fluffy I like it
because they're going to the place with
a hot tub so we needed something with a
robe but private roads are so good and
they actually wash up really nicely as
low as I feel like it's really important
because I personally live in my robe and
I'm at home like TMI but I kind of just
walk around in my road and wearing
without anything else underneath it
sometimes via either library like and
for eight pounds I thought that was an
absolute bargain for a row because
sometimes you can go up to like 30 quid
buying a decent one but no my marks got
you to eight pounds I then picked up
some slippers because I've never
normally explicit person like I just
don't wear them I just walk around
barefoot which is so bad I know but it
should I have it so I picked up these
and these are memory foam like satin
lipid and I thought these were adorable
these are only four pounds and it's got
a little like white fluffy bow and then
all the pink around here and they are
like memories very much you can feel it
there's a full past I thought these are
so cute and it'll match our dramas and
our very cute so for my little holidays
and just around the house I thought this
would be really nice and I sold the good
as well I live by promises that I do buy
them I have like when I do my slippers
that always you climb up once I just get
to wear them but they are really really
in quality at four pounds I then picked
up something that I've seen a lot of
people at the moment and these are
fishnet tights now I personally wouldn't
wear them like just on their own and
less on top of you goes like a festival
or something but I'm planning on wearing
these like under my ripped jeans I
thought that was it really cool so these
are three pounds or two pairs and I
thought that was a really good price
like we have two pairs of sushi at time
bargain see I would pick these up
because I was going to order some off of
pretty little things but they were like
six pounder pair so I got a Cal go to
Primark very exactly the same so
hundreds dead if you're looking for
something go to Primark because they
look really good under ripped jeans and
so I really like poking out the top as
well so if you want to be like in style
I guess
yeah these okay so the other holy thing
I got was only a pound and it was this
cute little marble triangle photo holder
if you know me know that I love my
Polaroids and my photos and just
everything like that and I thought this
was so cute for a pound and they have
them in all different shape that's all
different sizes as well but I was there
I just got like this small little
triangle ones I thought this was at best
in my room but I'm just gonna pop this
here I think the picture of me and
Cumbria cute in it yeah I really like
that and that's only a pound then as you
guys know I also swear by Primark nails
I absolutely love them even though they
have all fallen off my nails right now I
only have five left on between both
hands
I've had these pair on for knee three
weeks so they have lasted so I picked up
a set and this is in the shade called
cashmere and either only a pound you get
24 nails and as long as you put enough
glue on they will last but if you only
put a droplet of glue on of course
they're not gonna last
so put quite a bit of glue on it press
them down and they promise you they will
stay on for a long time the only account
and personally for me I just feel like I
don't want to pay like 30 pounds every
week or every two weeks to get my nails
burn I've started in myself it's bit of
like a pamper evening if you will so
Stephanie recommended for a pound I then
picked up this little thing at the tail
because I don't need you to like travel
me and stuff Alabama's Garnier ultimate
blends face mask face mask hair mask in
a little packet which I can take with me
when I go on holidays and this was like
40 or 50 P so I thought that was a
bargain and then finally I picked up
some new sunglasses not that I need any
more but I just really wanted some
without super thick frames I feel like
the thick frames won't suit me a lot
better so they just pink and it ombre
down is this clear thing I've got these
where go away with benefit because I
thought these would be really cute and
pink and these are only two pounds and I
actually look like really nice on my
head as well which is what I like -
they're a wesen glasses on my head more
than on my eyes but yeah I really likes
be for two pounds so with time to check
recommend Primark sunglasses I do not
buy sunglasses from anywhere oh so that
at the end of today's video I really
hope you enjoyed it and let me know if
you get both
a huge issue thumbs up also I have been
vlogging over on my second channel which
I really think you should going to check
out I recently just started a larger
