back and I'm going to be doing a huge
drugstore and high-end makeup haul you
guys know I love a good haul and I
recently have got a ton of new makeup
that again I feel like I need to share
with you because I am obsessing over
some of these products and they have
definitely moods themself into my
everyday makeup routine and everyday
skincare routine so I thought you know
what I'm going to sit down this week's
video and I'm gonna do a whole so as you
guys may know I'm in the middle of doing
my duty as either at the moment and as
I'm filming this I still have 10 exams
left but when you'll see in this I will
only have three allowing two so happy
because once that week is over I
literally am on a summer holiday for
three months which means the videos and
the content and the quality of my
content is going to be absolutely insane
I promise like literally my whole summer
is working for you and I'm just super
excited to be able to put so much time
into YouTube so also while were on this
fact make sure to go and follow my
Instagram snapchat and Twitter which
will be linked down below because I'm
going to be so much more active on them
now due to season nearly over and I'm so
excited
also because I'm working on a few secret
projects for you guys I know it's so
annoying when youtubers say that but it
is really good so you're just gonna have
to wait but yet other than that I really
hope you enjoy the video and let's get
started so I'm going to start off with
hair because I always get asked so many
questions about my hair now at the
moment I'm having a bit of an issue
where my hair is falling out and
literally it's falling out everywhere my
room on my clothes downstairs like it's
just so disgusting and I think it's
stress and like overthinking things I
don't know I just think it's like to do
a school but I finally found something
that is kind of keeping that down and
this is the new Garnier ultimate blend
the delicate soother hair mask so it's
just into this white pot here and it's
gone down quite a bit since I bought it
actually I bought it with my friend Katy
when we went shopping one day after
school and it smells so good I used to
have the matching shampoo and
conditioner and it didn't my hair feel
really soft but then I swapped to
Alberto bow psalm again because I wanted
to like strip out of the basics and
she's quite like a cheap shampoo and
conditioner and it's actually really
good but this is 5 pounds and I just pop
this on the end of
hair just to keep them really like
moisturize and nourish and I've
definitely noticed a difference in the
softness of my hair it just feels a lot
more soft and smooth and when I brush
it's very silky which is exactly what I
want and this is for fragile hair which
is definitely what I have another
skincare perch I recently picked up was
also because of my friend Caitlin and
this is the avian facial spray that's
basically what it's called it looks like
this this is the mini version and it was
four pounds and there's also a big
version that you can get those eight
pounds and it's basically just a
refreshing mist that you can spray on
your face before and after your makeup
and I'm not saying it will keep your
makeup on for longer but it makes your
makeup feel a lot less light on your
face and it doesn't soak into your skin
as much I've been using this one spray
in the morning before my makeup one
spray after my makeup and one spray
after I've moisturize at night and this
is so good I'm very skeptical at buying
the big one because I didn't want to
spend 8 pounds on basically water but
honestly it's so good and especially
during the summer months when you're
just so hot it's that nice little kind
of spritz of refreshment that's on your
makeup and it just feels so good so 100%
would recommend this and you can pick it
up from boots or superdrug the next
skincare thing I have is the Garnier
skin active rose water day cream now
again I picked this up because of
Caitlyn this is a moisturizer quite
clearly as I've said and I have oily
skin and I recently found out that you
shouldn't moisturize your skin if you
have oily skin but I just really really
like this so I have been using it and it
does keep the dry parts of my skin a lot
more moisturizing so I think I have
combination skin but this was I want to
say two pounds 99 from boots and it's so
oh my gosh so so nice I literally love
the smell in it so much it's really
really good and it balances out my oil
even though I have oily skin it hasn't
necessarily like stop the oil completely
but it's balanced it out and stop my
skin from producing as much as it
usually would like would in the summer
months so this is really good and I
would recommend it I'm going to be
buying up the whole range of this stuff
because it was really good and it does
hydrate and soothe my skin throughout
the summer months and the last kind of
skincare e thing I have is from treacle
moon and this is the my coconut Island
hand cream so I have loved treacle moon
stuff for so long I always get their
shower gels or especially around
Christmas time and recently they've come
up with these in I found this in Tesco
two pounds and it's basically just a
little hand and nail bomb and it's so
nice just to carry about in your handbag
or your school bag like if you've been
doing exams and stuff and your hands are
in her and it just a bit like put a bit
of this on after it's so good I just
love this a lot and all my friends are
using it at the moment and it's just a
really good buy and I thought it was
really cheap for two pounds I don't know
is that cheaper expensive for hand cream
I thought it was cheap for the size of
the pot and it does really work and as
well you can just put on your nails and
it's really really nice so I picked this
up from Tesco for two pounds and they
also had three other sent but this one
was my favorite
the next thing I have was sent to me in
YPO box but are assessing over it and it
has made my everyday makeup routine so
much better illiteracy Nippon fab
highlighting palette so as you guys may
know I was actually an ambassador for
nip and fab back in October for their
brand new teen skincare range and I
didn't meet up with them and it was so
so cool
I recently they put out a whole new
makeup range in super drug if you go
into any super drug or your local one
they should have it and they had the
most amazing range of things ranging
from foundation primer all the way up to
eyes and lips and it's absolutely
incredible I literally love this palette
so much I think you can see how much
I've used it by all the little dust and
like you can see how much I've dug into
each of the pans but this one here the
yellow shade is my absolute favorite I
never knew that yellow highlighter would
suit my skin so much I normally go to
shades they're kind of like this end of
the palette but when I went through this
I was like well what have I been missing
out on I love it on the end of my nose
and on my cheeks here and you can just
see the gorgeous yellow undertones
shining through in the sunlight and it's
so so beautiful and I just love this
palette a lot I feel like it's quite a
good Jeep for that Anastasio Beverly
Hills ones I really also like like the
ultimate Glo kit but the yellow shade
just it has me I love it
whilst also talking about highlighters
and blushes and everything like that
recently collection brought out a brand
new little trio this is literally is
called the collection highlight brush
and bronze trio and it's really really
good I have swatch all three of them and
I wear the highlighter on a weekly basis
to school so if you like seeing around
school hopefully my highlights pop in
but this is so so beautiful I just love
how pigmented it is
and I don't know if you can see it but
it's just such a gorgeous shimmery light
color and again even like the pink blush
it's so beautiful and I don't really
wear blush I used to wear blush all the
time but then I switched to contour and
I actually kind of prefer contour now
but I just contoured the anxiety of
Beverly Hills palette but this is so
nice and I think this retails for like 3
or 4 pounds which is such a bargain
you've got a little mirror as well and
if you like doing all three on an
everyday basis this is a nice light time
palette for you to use it is on the back
that this is it's three and one face
shaper for a blendable satin finish and
I 100% agree so I would definitely
recommend this I then recently picked up
something brand new from L'Oreal and
this is the mega volume miss baby roll
mascara now I have this on today on top
of my ardell demi wispies lashes and
this is amazing I wear this everyday to
school I used to love and I still do
love the Maybelline lash sensational
that is my life go to mascara but then
recently I found this and it's so
amazing it's not like a fiber wand it's
a plastic wand but it's so good and it
just picks up my eyelashes perfectly I
start by just going it right from the
root of my eyelash to the top and then I
just do the tops and it separates them
perfectly I haven't managed to get this
clumpy yet which is a really good sign
and I just really really like it you can
get it in two really funky colors as
well and some of my YouTube friends
amazingly were like the promoters for
this which is after the insane
but yeah I love this so so much and we
definitely recommend it you can get it
from boot Superdrug Tesco wherever you
feel like for 8 pounds and it's
incredible I no reason he went burn your
shopping with my best friend and Burt we
met up with some of our friends Spencer
and has added a mini me up there which
was so cool and I went into debenhams
and they literally had Kat Von D I
haven't tried any different capaldi
before and I've been dying to so I was
so excited when I found like get this
you see Kat Von D locket concealer and
my god have I been waiting for this for
so long it was 20 pounds and mine is in
the shade l-3 warm so I didn't get the
lighter so I got two shades up from that
because I feel like if I get the
lightest it would have highlighted my
spots instead of covering them so I went
a few shades darker but it's absolutely
incredible I've still not the collection
one and I actually put that on top of
these just to add a bit more highlight
but the coverage
this is incredible and this as well as
the top shape tape was one of my like
concealers I really wanted to buy so I'm
glad I've got one and I've just got my
eye on the shape tape if you guys know
what I can get the Tarte shape tape from
without having to pay like extortion at
like shipping prices or whatever please
let me know because I really want it but
yeah I picked this up from Debenhams and
it's absolutely incredible and has made
its way into my everyday makeup routine
and finally I have a bunch of stuff from
benefit which they only sent to my PO
box and kind of sent me NPR packages
which is absolutely insane
first of all they sent me this like
camera box and it's basically all to do
with the Porefessional they're serving
the Porefessional primer and the
Porefessional matte rescue but they also
send me these two products this is the
Agent Zero shine powder and I still
haven't had the chance to try this out
yet it's quite like from what I remember
yellow toned I can't actually remember I
swear I remember it being yellow toned I
don't a bit more like a banana powder
but I'm super excited to try this and
I'm actually going to be using this for
prom which as you guys are watching this
would have already been it would have
been on the Friday so head of Triton
took out the pictures of my prom but
yeah I'm going to be using this for my
prom makeup so very excited about that
and they sent me the brand new port
minimizing makeup and I actually don't
really know what this is it has a button
and a little sponge at the bottom which
is super cool but it has a button here
and then you just twist the lid off and
it looks perfectly my shade so haven't
used it yet but it just says face makeup
to minimize the appearance of pores so
if you guys want me to do like a first
impressions or a testing video on this
then let me know and just give me a
little comment down below and then they
also sent me a huge PR package which
basically was like a beach hut and they
sent me all of the brand new hoola
products so they send me any of hoola
bronzer which is a classic and I
absolutely love that and then they send
me the brand new hoola light which
actually I think is going to be perfect
for me because I don't want it to go to
like much on my contour but well back in
my face but this is like the perfect
shade that I like so I'm super super
excited to try that out and again are we
trying to outfit prom and then they sent
me the brand new benefit dandelion
twinkle highlighter which I am obsessing
over I've used this I think three or
four times now and as you can see I've
got a lot of new highlighters but it's
so so beautiful
I mean I probably
I bought it if I didn't get a cent it
purely for the fact that I have so many
highlighters but now that I have it I
would 110 recommend it and then finally
sent me the hoola quickiy contour stick
now I cannot cream contour to save my
life
I just find it really hard and it's
something that I'm going to try
throughout this summer like if you want
me to like do like a first try video or
something let me know and I'll try it
but I've never tried this before so are
we excited to try it and like cream
highlight and all that stuff but if you
do want to see me do that let me know
but yeah the packaging is so cute and it
reminds me of each other who know liquid
bronzer but yeah that is basically my
huge haul video for today I really hope
you enjoyed it let me know if you did by
giving this video a huge thumbs up video
I love you all so so much and I'll see
you next Sunday at 10 a.m. for a brand
new video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
