going to be doing a huge summer haul for
2016 I know I haven't done a haul in
about two months style which is really
unlike me because I used to do them like
every month and I think I got to one
point where I was doing them like every
few weeks and that is because I do have
a little shopping addiction and plus is
going to summer now so I actually do
have an excuse but yeah I'm not gonna
bother with a long intro because there
is a lot of stuff to show and I don't
think I'm gonna be able to get through
it under like 15 minutes anyway see ya
I'm just gonna get into this video have
a drink have a snack sit down relax and
let's guess I'm gonna start off with
makeup because makeup is the love of my
life and it's what I spend a lot of
money on so the first things I'm
actually going to show you which I got
to send and they are from Maybelline and
I didn't get aftershow these isn't
sponsored but I love them so much and I
actually already had one of them because
that's how much I love them and they are
the Maybelline vivid matte liquid color
sensational lipsticks I already had this
one here which is in the shade nude
flush and they sent me every single
shade but these three are my favorites
the consistency of these are very much
like the Kylie lip kits they're not as
thick and they do go on quite thin but
nevertheless these are so good they're
very very highly pigmented considering
they go on quite thin and they do last a
long time I think these are about 7
pounds to buy and you have quite a lot
of product in them for 7 pounds and I
like the packaging as well it's very
sleek and like basic which I like it's
not too fancy so and they're also really
easy to store because of the shape of
them as up which is always handy and the
other thing for maybe you don't have to
show you is something brand new it's the
Maybelline lash sensational luscious
with oil blend mascara I love this I
wear this every single day ever since I
got it I've wore it it is so good I mix
it with the other lash sensational
because this one's really black and it
makes them quite thick and then the
other lash sensational just like two
separates my eyelashes out so it's so
good and like when you open it you can
see the oil blend in it because it's so
like shiny and it's so black
I don't know if it is like ultra black
or something because it's so good but
honestly I would really recommend this
and this is about eight pounds but
normally they have like a sweeper to
like buy one get one half price or
something like that the next thing I
have to show you is from NYX and it is a
concealer palette and it is the NYX
conceal correct contour palette in the
shade light I've had my eye on this for
a long long time and I recently went to
Westfield Shepherds Bush in London and I
was like you know what I'm gonna pick it
up because they had a NYX contouring the
boots and this is so beautiful so at the
moment I've only used this shade here
because I'm not too confident with using
the other stage just yet I've only like
swatch them and stuff but we're wearing
like out wise are you at this one I've
got my words completely messed up there
I wore this one and it's so good the
pigmentation is really high and it
blends really well
I used it under my eyes and it
completely curved my under-eye circles I
wouldn't say I have huge under eye
circles but they do cover what I do have
and I just love this so much I think it
was like 10 pounds which I don't know
pretty cheap considering it is like a
dupe for the Mac palette which you can
get like this and it's really really
good I'm definitely going to try these
two shades out necks like the color
correction shades because then I'll show
you that I need but I love the packing
of this it's very sleek easy to store
very cheap and actually a lot easier to
get hold off now other thing I picked up
whilst I was in West of Shepherds Bush
is another concealer and it is a brand
I've never spoke about on my channel but
I've really really wanted and it's the
LA girl Pro conceal high definition
concealer I got this at a shop called
beauty base and I've never heard of shop
abuse base before I just saw it as I was
walking past and they stole Milani BH
Cosmetics la go and they colors they
stole everything I think they even sold
wet and wild and it was crazy to be in
there like I was so excited when I saw
this this is five pounds which I thought
was really reasonable for a concealer
like this and you just squeeze it up and
it comes out under the brush and I again
put this under my eyes on my chin and on
my nose and this is a really really high
coverage concealer a lot higher then you
just like kind of think I don't know
it's very thick so it is really good
coverage because I'm actually go into
Florida this year so I was planning on
picking
stuff anyway but now I don't have to
because I said it in London which is
always great to find out the next things
I picked up make me want to cry nearly
because I'm so grateful that I finally
got them are you ready I finally got
them I got candy k lip kit and literally
lip gloss I have actually filmed a whole
video on these and it's on private on my
channel so if you do want to see that
let me know like I'll leave a comment
down below and just go sums up that
comment if you do want to see it because
always I don't know do I not if I know
you upload it it's like an extra
Saturday video but yeah so if you do
want to see how whole with you on these
I would do okay so we just got off my
channel but I got a candy cane lip kit
and literally lip gloss this candy cane
lip kit is the best thing since sliced
bread I have it on right now and the
pigmentation is really really high it is
nothing like any other matte lipstick
shade I've ever tried before the
consistency the texture how it feels a
little like it's so smooth it's like
velvet it's blowing velvet to Turkish
sorry nice and then I got literally lip
gloss which again is gorgeous it's this
new D shade haven't got as much use out
of things because I just love the lip
kit but I'm gonna wear this when I go
out for dinner and everything and I just
love it I think this one's how about 10
pounds and this worked out about 20 so
if you kind of add it up that's actually
really really good but yeah as I said I
will do a whole video on these if you
want one so just go down below and
thumbs up that comment why then have
some like accessories slash tools I
guess you could say because who doesn't
love a good tweezer slash brush I went
into Primark recently and I saw that
they've sold copper tweezers and these
are in a 2-pack for 99p and when you're
obsessed with copper like I am hint hint
at my room
by the way pineapples in Primark isn't
it amazing
yeah I know you're obsessed with copper
like me you obviously have to go pick
these up for 99p I mean you can't really
go wrong like they're absolutely
beautiful like they looks only one room
it's the little things in life like how
they like look in your room and like
yeah it's really nice just go get these
if you need to pluck your eyebrows
because they're really good and then the
other like tour I've picked up recently
is from Amazon and it is this like fake
artists brush I didn't
on a splash out on 60 quid on the real
one because I didn't know if I liked it
and I'm really not into wasting my money
on things I don't really know if I like
or not so this was like five pounds from
Amazon and it is really good like this
is good for a fake so I can only imagine
what the real one would be like but it
just blends your makeup in so smooth and
you just like blend it outwards and like
I don't know it feels so so good like
the product doesn't stick in the brush
either which I like so you can't get it
dirty not spreading bacteria or anything
but obviously this doesn't look as
glamorous as the real one because
obviously the real one is like gold and
everything but this one is still really
really pretty and I love this so much it
blends your makeup really flawlessly and
gives you like an airbrushed complexion
that's why I would definitely call up an
airbrushed complexion and it gives a lot
more coverage than using a normal Beauty
Blender as well so really like this and
I've been used this on everyday basis I
just first of all like dab it in with a
Beauty Blender a little bit and then go
over it with this and it's amazing
definitely recommend this so I now have
a few clothes image to show you because
as I said I am going on holiday to
Florida this year which is really
exciting so I've been picking up a few
holiday bits the first thing I picked up
is this bikini and it is just this lace
up bikini and it's from pretty little
thing I'm a huge fan of lace up things
as you will see from like oh no because
I can't show them in this haul I'm going
to do a good holiday haul but yeah you
will see that I've got a lot of lace-up
things and this was ten pounds to buy
it's really really nice it's really
comfy on maybe do a try and clip I don't
know because it is a bikini you know but
yeah I really do love this so I got this
I love it I then got something else that
I love and this is also actually no this
is a pretty little thing this is from
misguided as you tell I love misguided a
pretty little thing so I got this palm
tree skirt and it just looks like this
so beautiful it has this gorgeous palm
tree pattern on it like there's a minty
green color and it just goes all the way
down here and then it has like these
little slits here and I love this so
much I bought a white lace up top
also from misguided to wear with this
and I thought this would be like a nice
outfit for like Disney World or like
Universal or something but yeah this was
I believe your student discount I got
this for like 10 pounds so what a
bargain I am going to be giving away
