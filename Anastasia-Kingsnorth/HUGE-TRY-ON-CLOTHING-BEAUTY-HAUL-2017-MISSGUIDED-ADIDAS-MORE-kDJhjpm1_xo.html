hi everyone so for today's video I am
back and I'm going to do a huge clothing
and makeup haul by the way at the
beginning of my video that was my little
brother who wanted to come say hi if you
do want to see a video with him now he
is actually like talking more let me
know it just comment down below because
I really want him to do my makeup I
don't think that would be a really fun
video so let me know if you want to see
that but yeah for today are you doing a
huge clothing a makeup haul I've
recently been buying a few makeup bits
and clothing items and I've also got
some things since YPO box so I thought I
would put together a huge haul also if
you want to see a makeup tutorial for
this makeup that I'm wearing here make
sure to check out last week's video I
will link it on screen now and down
below and of course it's on my channel
so make sure to go watch that if you
haven't already but yeah and that I'm
just gonna get stuff starting off is
closed
I am super super excited for these but
the bad thing is I don't know what
they're called so I'm hoping that you
guys can just kind of google them or
link them down below but basically I've
got a new Annie - trainers they look
like this they're so nice I was with a
saffron and her friend G in Birmingham
and we just went into shoe and I just
saw these and I was like okay I really
like those so I just bought them it just
says Annie - and that's it it doesn't
say what shoes they are
they're so nice adjust gray and they had
three loads of different colors and I've
got gray laces and then this bit like
overlaps to keep your feet warm I don't
know but they're so nice and I've just
been wearing these of jeans and like
you've got the big white bit up the side
here I don't know they're just so comfy
and I've wore them so much I'd still
haven't got a blister because this bits
so padded so these were 75 pounds I
think was Riga so thinking I should go
buy these if you haven't then went to
misguided which they've got in
Selfridges now in the Birmingham boring
and my god was it amazing I literally
love misguided so much so when I found
out that they had a misguided in there I
was absolutely buzzing so the first
thing I thought is a bit weird really
and it is black mesh top I thought this
would look kind of cool if I maybe wore
it over like a sports bra or like a
dress I don't really know what I was
thinking when I bought it but it was
only I think it was 12 pounds yeah it's
I don't know it's 12 pounds which I
thought was really really good and it's
really long as well I got it in a size
12 just so it's quite baggy on me so
normally about a size 8 but I wanted it
to cover a dress if I wanted to wear
over a dress but yeah it's just a nice
little like piece to have in a wardrobe
I guess if you want to spice an outfit
up so I thought that was interesting for
12 pounds I then picked up this white
top and this is very similar to the top
I wore when I was if saffron and loads
of you guys asked where from where that
was from but from knew that by the way
but I basically bought a white version
of it this one is from misguided though
and it's just got this like rocky
pattern on it with like rips and then
like it hangs down so you've got a
little bit of cleavage but not too much
which I like I will show you it on but
yeah I just really love this top and
this was 15 pounds which is 2 pounds
more than one I paid from new look but
it's very very nice and I'm really into
these type of tops at the moment so I
got that I also got this jumper which I
absolutely love
and it's great and it just is Oakland on
it and it just says that and then under
it says United States California and
it's all ripped at the bottom bitch so
like fuzzy inside and then I've got the
sleeves here but normally I roll the
sleeves up like this so they just kind
of hang over like that so it's a really
nice like long slouchy jumper to her
have but it's also like I can't explain
it it just looks so fashionable when I
wear it I just really like it and this
was 18 pound so this was the most
expensive thing out of all the things I
bought but I think this is so worth it
and I really really do love it so yeah I
would definitely recommend you guys
check out this guide and if you haven't
already now moving on to some beauty bit
that I bought recently the first thing
I've got is the L'Oreal Paris pure clay
and purity mask
now I couldn't remember if I showed this
in a whole already so if I have I'm so
sorry because I literally just couldn't
remember but amber was raving all about
these and at the moment so are a lot of
any youtubers so I just thought you know
what I'm going to have to buy one so
I've used this now two three times not
many at all it's gone down a little bit
but not much and it is really really
good this one is perfect for oily skin
I'm also really interested in getting
the black one because I think that's a
charcoal based one and I really need
that cuz I'm very bad paws but this
almost for all your skin because all
around here I tend to get oily within
about an hour or two put my makeup on
but this has definitely shortened the
amount of time I have with the oil on my
face
it probably won't consume about five to
six hours now my makeup which is really
really good and that's such an
improvement on what it was before and
this was only six pounds I think I got
this on offer and maybe it's meant to be
12 but I only paid six and it's a really
like nice glass tub you get a lot of
product in it and it is really really
good so if you still want to jump on the
hype and get one of these I would
definitely recommend you to then I know
if you guys have heard this you probably
have but a company called Five Guys
which is the most amazing place ever I
literally love their food so much we
have one in Milton Keynes which is about
half an hour away from me
and then there's one in Birmingham as
well and they actually sent me these
little like coupon e things and they get
me like every time I go to five guys
lunch is on us I don't know this is a
beauty I make a breathing but I was
going to say a huge thank you because I
love five guys and I always go there
anyway
when I milk clean so the fact that
they're letting me have my food for free
is absolutely insane so thank you so
much five guys leave it the next thing
we have is from ciaté London and this
is the brand new Julie sticks now
so excited to try this because I'm not
normally like a highlighting like a
liquid highlighter person or stick
colored person I tend to go for powder
highlight I feel like that suits my skin
best but I've been seeing loads of
people rave about these at the moment so
of course I've got one and this it just
says CIT London juhi stick I hope I'm
saying that right by the way and it's
just so beautiful it's got these little
stars on it in the packaging it's really
nice as well and then when you just open
it here it just got this little domi
ball and I use this today underneath my
powder highlight I don't if you can see
that but it's so beautiful if I put a
bit on my hand you should be able to see
it's just kind of this like glistening
highlight I can't explain it but it
looks so so nice for just pop it on my
cheeks it just glistens is so beautiful
gonna put something into my nose as well
a little bit of nose highlight but yeah
you just twist it up and you've got
loads in here but it's honestly so good
so if you guys are interested in finding
your highlighter I would definitely
recommend this it's not as like brightly
pigmented as I said Marylou or Becca but
still it's a very very good highlighter
for the price I have been recently
picked up a brand-new concealer this is
the NYX full coverage concealer it's in
a pot I haven't even used it yet because
I use the NYX concealer palette to go
around my eyebrows and like carve them
out and stuff and the shades are using
that has ran out but I didn't want buy
the whole new palette again because I've
still got like every other shade still
like not even barely used so I just
bought a part of it because apparently
this is really good concealer I've heard
from a lot of people it's very creamy
which I like because I never usually use
potted products I normally just use
stick concealers so I'm very excited to
try this and it is only 5 pounds and
then finally I have to press packages
from benefit which I'm absolutely over
the moon about because I literally love
benefits so much so the first one is
this one is a little small in here and
it says hashtag California below and
when you open it out is so cute so they
sent me two of the brand-new gala for
Nia brushes special brushes blushes and
they are so you thought I cannot either
so it just looks like this is California
on it and it's such beautiful packaging
it's so summery and then when you open
it
like a little mandala blush and it's so
nice and so pigmented it's got some very
nice reddish undertones and I've got a
little bit of it on today but it's so so
beautiful I love like the gold packaging
but yeah they sent me two of these one
for myself and then they sent me a
little note and it says give one or two
your sunshine so I'm going to give one
of these away and I literally love them
so much thank you benefit we then have
another whopper of a package which I
just can't believe how nice benefit are
to me and this is the brand-new benefit
a good pet stop the name these are the
brand-new they're real double the lip
liner and lip sticks in one and I just
thought this is going to be filled with
lipsticks no I open it and it's filled
with lipsticks and eyeshadows oh my gosh
this is like the most attractive angle
ever but can we just twister so I have
every single shade of the brand-new
lipsticks and every single shade of the
new eyeshadows and I'm going to be
honest I haven't had time to try these
out yet just because there is so many
products I keep getting sent to try and
I mean to try them but there's just so
many so I'm going to try these I'm
really interested to try and juicy berry
and nude scandal and these little
eyeshadow palettes as well are the balm
they're so cute
they've really like travel friendly as
well and it's also just got their real
mascara at the bottom but this press
package is like the cutest thing ever
benefit into face doing the best press
packages I can't even thank you so much
but yeah that is basically it for
today's video I really hope you enjoyed
if you did give it a huge thumbs up also
remember to go check out last week's
video if you want to see how I did my
makeup and yeah thank you so much for
all the brands that have sent me stuff
to my P o box like I have my PA bucks
down below if you guys want to write me
a letter or anything like that
if you do I'll actually do like a P o
box opening and sit there redoing your
letters so it's not something you want
me to do let me know but yet other than
that I really hope you enjoy the video
and I will see you next week at 10 a.m.
for a brand new one I love you bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
