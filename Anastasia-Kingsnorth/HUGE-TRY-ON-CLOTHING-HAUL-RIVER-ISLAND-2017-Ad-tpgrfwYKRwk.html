back and I'm going to doing a huge try
on river island haul for 2017 so I have
a ton of things here from River Island
which I'm super excited to show you I'm
going to do a try on haul so you can see
what everything looks like on but
basically these are a few of my
favourite pieces that I found on their
website that I literally love and I'm
pretty sure you guys are going to love
them too because these are so like in
fashion at the moment like I can't even
I'm wearing one of them today and I know
already that people are going to be like
where is that jumper from so River
Island but yeah basically I'm leaving of
or today so I'm just going to stop
talking and I'm just going to go
straight on into the video so I'm going
to start off with bags because I have to
back to show you because I'm really
excited about both of them so the first
one in both backpacks but the first one
is this and it's basically a pastel pink
velvet mini backpack so you've probably
seen these basically everywhere at the
moment because they are so in fashion
but literally I fell in love with this
one just says river island here it's got
like a gold zip here was like a chain
but I just popped that in there all in
ones come out and then it's got a gold
detailing and on the back it's like a
rose gold material it's so pretty and
I'm super excited to use this I'm going
to use this for summertime and it is 26
pounds these are perfect if you're kind
of going like a shopping trip or maybe
even to school like if you don't have to
take much this is just a really cute bag
to have I then got this bag which i
think is definitely my favorite and it's
basically just this mini black backpack
this is so simple yet so pretty she's
got zip detailing and it's all black it
says River Island with gold details and
then it also comes with this little key
ring that just has like loads of
different bits on it you can take it on
and off
to be honest I'm probably going to add
this somewhere else because I kind of
like the bag just plain and then I can
use the keyring like on other things
again this is 26 pounds and I just think
this is a really cute little simple
backpack to have in your wardrobe really
I'm going to be probably using this as
my everyday bag for now and then I'll
swap over to the other one for the
spring and summer and then swapping back
to this one for the winter but yeah I
really do love this bag and for 26
pounds is such good quality I then
picked up a makeup bag while I was on
the website because I really needed a
new makeup bag my other one broke and I
found this one and it's just like this
holographic snakeskin rectangular makeup
I've basically it was ten pounds and it
such good quality like it feels so thick
and there's a lot of room in this as
well obviously at the moment it's padded
out with tissue paper but there's so
much room in this to put all my makeup
and it'll also clip pallets as well
which is really good it's a really good
travel size and I'm pretty sure it's
going to fit in both of my backpacks as
well which is good if I want to take
makeup with me but it's just got again
white gold detailing and it feels really
nice and it feels very expensive if you
are looking for a makeup bag I
definitely recommend looking at River
Island because I've never really looked
at their makeup bags before but when I
saw this I instantly fell in love and I
knew I had to get it I then got a pair
of shoes which I'm so excited about
literally I wanted a pair of these for
the longest time and I saw them on the
website and I just knew I had to have
them so there are these white trainers
but they have like the embroidery on the
side and I know these aren't going to be
everybody's cup of tea but I literally
live in like basic trainers and I just
thought these were kind of like to spice
it up a bit I really like it it's all
because all of the laces are hidden
underneath here and you just have one
hole it's basically just all white with
the embroidery which is so up my street
I'm going to leave links to these down
below so you can go and get them if you
want to but honestly these are so nice
I'm going to wear them tonight some
going out and I'm going to like wear
them in and stuff but these generally
are going to be probably my most worn to
summer shoe I just did you loved them so
much and they're such good quality and
you want to know my size I'm a size 4 I
have really small feet my feet basically
stopped growing now yeah so these are
super cute and I'm going to be wearing
these a lot throughout the summer suit
black jeans or I could even wear them
with shorts or skirts basically wear
with everything but oh well they pretty
much go with everything as well because
they're so basic but they've just got
the nice little pattern on the side so
they'll pretty much go with anything you
have but yeah I picked up those now
moving on to clothing I then just picked
up a basic pair of plain black leggings
because I feel like I don't have enough
plain black leggings in my wardrobe and
I've never tried to provide the leggings
but I have heard a lot about them so
these are just the normal ones a minor
in size 6 are I think that's the size
but yeah these are only 10 pounds which
is really good for leggings to be honest
and they feel really good quality as
well they're quite stretchy which is
nice and they were really good length so
fingers crossed
these weren't really good possibly might
work out in these in the summer don't
really notably work out that much but
you never know you go my start working
out and she might wear these I then
picked up some river island jeans
because again
I've heard so much about their genes
literally they are such good quality
they're 40 pounds and they just look
like this literally just plain black
jeans all down but honestly these are so
nice they've got really nice back
pockets it says River Island here and
they've got a front pocket actually
though they're fake okay don't have
front pockets they're just like the ones
that kind of look like it but they're
not actually pockets but minor in the
size six are then this is 32-hour and
this is high-rise jeggings a super soft
super comfy and I would definitely
recommend these for summertime as well
even though it gets kind of hot here in
England these are quite Airy and you can
wear these of like a crop top or
whatever so I would definitely recommend
River riding jeans then I picked up this
top which I'm wearing and obviously this
is a try on haul so you're going to see
the full top but it's basically like a
rocky type of sweatshirt and it just has
this choke around here with a cutout
triangle this is good because if it's a
bit of a colder day you can still wear
it because you're covered but then
you've still got this gap here to let
some air three which is really nice and
the sleeves are just like all kind of
like distress and it's kind of acid wash
but it's kind of not and you know the
pattern is just really nice I'm just
super super comfy I'm pretty sure seth
has this as well and I think I've seen
her in it a few times and it looks
really nice and I just saw it on their
website and I was like I'm gonna have to
pick that up because it's so comfy
inside it's just kind of like that soft
fluffy material which is really nice
because I'll have a good jumper next
thing I picked up is this grey t-shirt
and this was 20 pounds he's basically
got a sequin cactus on and I think this
is so so so cute literally I wanted to
teach out like this so long I see so
many people wear them just tucked into
jeans again with the embroidered shoes
and I just thought it was really nice so
I just picked this up in a size 6 and I
think it looks quite small but then
it'll be quite tight fitting so
hopefully this will look pretty nicely
yeah it just says can't touch this yeah
it's just really comfy and really salty
so I definitely recommend you pick up
their like basic t-shirts they're really
really comfy then picked up another kind
of Rocky t-shirt and this one has a
really interesting back to it so it's
just white and it says heartbreaker on
it which I kind of isn't really
relatable for me I don't think but I
really like the t-shirt and it's just
all pink with a rose on it and it's got
this little like detailing which makes
it kind of like shimmering the light
which is nice and yeah I just thought
this is really nice and on the back it's
basically all open and then it just has
it'll like tiny knock poet thingy at the
bottom but yeah those would be really
nice to summer again to where we may be
the jeans that I picked up or short I
thought this wasn't really cute even to
wear videos and stuff but yeah this was
20 pounds as well and then the final
t-shirt I picked up again is kind of
like a rocky edgy t-shirt it has quite a
few rips in it and it basically says
mermaids are always on holiday and it's
just got a picture of a mermaid and it's
all just stress it's got loads of holes
in and stuff and all the holes go
through to the backers eye which I
really like I love these kind of like
just stress tops I've really been
getting into them recently and I have
quite a few of them but I thought this
one would be nice I got it in a size 6
and again it was 20 pounds but I just
thought this looked really cozy and
slouchy this loads quite a bit bigger
than you can't touch this once fingers
crossed it will still fit but it looks
really really nice and I'll have a link
to it down below but yeah I'm super
excited to wear this that is the end of
my trial clothing haul I really hope you
