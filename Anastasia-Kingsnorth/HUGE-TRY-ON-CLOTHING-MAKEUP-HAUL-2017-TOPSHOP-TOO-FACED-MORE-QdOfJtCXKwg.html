and I'm going to doing a huge try on
clothing and makeup and PR poll so if
you need to go I need one of these halls
and you guys loved it it was a mixture
of clothing p.o box and makeup and again
I've accumulated a ton of stuff which I
want to show you now I do realize I am
doing a fair few hauls on my channel at
the moment I am sorry if you don't like
calls but personally I love them their
videos I love to film and I find really
enjoyable and I flirt they help you guys
out a lot as well so I'm sorry about
that but I do have a lot of other videos
coming soon but also pride in this video
please comment down below some video
ideas that you want to see off of me
because I am a bit of a video block and
I don't really know what type of videos
to do so make sure you message me a lot
of video ideas and I can do those for
you but yeah without further ado I'm
just going to get straight on into the
hall and I hope you what so I'm going to
start off is clothing and then I'll go
on to makeup which also includes my few
box bits so the first thing I got is
actually this top here and it's from new
look
yeah new look it's basically this plain
nude pasty pink top and it has like
distress
edges I'm going to do a proper Tryon
clip so you guys can see it but I love
this top so much it's just like a nudie
color and you can wear it out with jeans
or tucked in jeans it's completely up to
you and how you style it I personally
wear it kind of tucked into jeans with a
little bit fallen out with a bomber
jacket I think it looks really cool and
rustic I just love like the jagged edge
tops I feel that the so in fashion and
it's almost only 10 pounds as well from
new looks so pretty good bargain by then
it went into forever 21 and I got this
in Amsterdam but I'm pretty sure they'll
stock it in London as well and it's
basically this pastel pink top and it
just says it creme de la creme on it and
like this black right in and I thought
this was so me for the summer like I
love like bounties and roxies but then I
also love a good old slogan tea and like
a pastel pink color so I got this and I
thought this is really me and it was
only I'm gonna show us and I think it
was like 9 pounds or like 9 euros which
is pretty good bargain then in firmus
anyone I've also picked up this jacket
which is like one of my favorite things
ever I'm always in this now and it's
just this black bomber jacket I'm trying
to find the top and on the back it just
says Arizona
trap-filled Arizona trap-filled it's
just this really cute Ponte jacket and
it has it's made out like a satiny
material and it has white stripes down
each sleeve and it has obviously that on
the back and then inside it's just a
really thin material it has it will pull
strings at the bottom and then all the
detailing is gold which I love this was
30 euros which I don't really know how
much that works out at maybe like 25 26
pounds but I love this and I've been
wearing this non-stop since I got it
like oh so nice I got this and I was in
Amsterdam for VidCon Amsterdam so yeah I
literally love this so so much and I
would definitely recommend you go pick
one of these up from forever 21 and then
back in this country I decided to pop
into Topshop and top them have such good
stuff at the moment like normally I go
into Topshop and I don't actually really
like much but I live she found so many
things that I like and it's basically
just this plain black t-shirt this is
babe's unite you may have seen this
appear on my Instagram several times
because I love it so much I wear it all
the time but actually it's so comfy it
was like 15 pounds I think
but this tucked into like black jeans is
so nice and I just think it's very
simple the right is really nice it has a
really big gap which I don't know why
but it's a really nice t-shirt and yeah
I'm gonna start to wear this more in my
videos because some cozy they are all
the clothing bits that I've got I've
really liked Brian clothes but I just
don't buy that many of them so that's
why I kind of always just pop them in
like random holes like this but I do
also have like other clothing who was up
on my channel like once or my specific
brands and stuff so I'll leave those
down below if you do want to see some
other try on clothing halls next we're
going to go in to my p.o box and make up
stuff so this is sent to me by beautybay
and literally I'm so so grateful for
this I nearly cried when I opened it so
it's the Oprah X nikkietutorials
collection and it was just one thing it
was the whole collection like beauty may
send me this as a surprise as they are
going to be stocking this on their
website now which is insane and it's so
beautiful it just looks like this and
then on the back it has a picture of
Nicky and a product breakdown and I've
never tried anything from over before
and I was going to get this but then I
was like no I don't think I will but
then they send me it so it looks like
this it comes on a little display case
which I'm actually displaying on the top
of my Alex drawers because I love it so
much
and it comes with three different liquid
lips and a highlighter that as I said
I've never tried anything from over
cosmetics before this and I am
pleasantly surprised this is the
highlighter it's a beautiful I did
swatches on my snapchat which I will
leave down below when I first got this I
always do like package openings and
stuff but how gorgeous are those three
shades I'm just going to pop a bit my
face because it's so much the packaging
is quite thin it doesn't feel are
necessarily cheap but it doesn't feel
very expensive either but the quality of
the product is incredible and then also
you have the three liquid lips so they
are very odd shades I feel you've got
color more orange color and metallic
Brown and then you've got this nude
color which is by far my favorite I am
out there with my lip colors but like
not that out there so this color is
perfect for me just on the end here it's
so beautiful so pigmented and I'll be
wearing this a lot I feel like it's a
perfect color for school actually yeah
but yeah this is the collection I love
it so so much you can have it either way
I guess over X nikkietutorials
or you can have Nikki's a gorgeous face
on it and have it that way it's just
such a beautiful collection and I'll
link it down below in the beauty band
website if it's out when this video
comes out well I literally love this so
much so thank you today
Beauty Bay forever surprising with
parcels and genuinely like I'm so
grateful so the other day later priority
with the brand-new laura geller
baked gelato swirl illuminator palette
again never tried anything from laura
geller before but i had heard of it and
I did hear that it was really good so I
was super excited to try it and they
basically sent me these and these are
three highlighters again they are super
super pigmented as you can see just on
the side here
I love the middle one it's just like a
Goldy color to pop that there they do
have some really good pigment to them
and there's three shades ballerina
gilja's honey and peach row and then it
comes with this like palette brush which
I'm definitely not going to use for
highlight nevertheless so beautiful the
packaging is quite thin I wouldn't say
the packaging is of the best quality
ever but it's really nice it's very thin
very compact to take out with you and
the quality of the product are amazing
now it said RRP 65 pounds but then it
said 22 power
so I'll leave the proper price down
below with a link but ya got this so I
think you guys should definitely go get
this if you're looking for a new
highlighter medicai then sent me some of
their brand new lipsticks so these are
the Urban Decay vice that liquid
lipsticks there's certainly five shades
so I have my favorite shade out here
because this is the shade I'm wearing
today and this is rapture I love this so
much this shade is very me it's like a
musical then we've got like a red shade
we've got Christ which is another red
shade we've got conspiracy which is a
metal eyes Brown a metallic Brown and
then we've got Big Bang which is more of
a a luminous purple but honestly these
lipsticks are so gorgeous and the
packaging is very slim as well which I
like I think these retail for about 15
pounds each and I would say they're
definitely worth the money they feel
really soft on my lips I don't feel like
they're going to come off I've wore this
one probably three or four times now it
has crunched up my lips crunched up that
was gross made my lips crack a little
bit but there my lips do that anyway so
I don't necessarily think it was the
product but genuinely these are really
good so I definitely would recommend
them and I'll leave the link down below
to face then recently sent me another
package and it said basically on it was
like you are a hangover queen and I was
like oh okay then and then I actually
sent me a brand new hangover primer I've
realized just a brand new actually not
brand new it's been out for a long time
because I've wanted it for a long time
and it's just so gorgeous the thing I
know about this is it has a pump it
looks like it's going to be a squeezy
bottle but then when you put it on your
face it's so sticky but like not the
nasty sticky like the sticky that you
know your makeup is going to stick to
and I've got this on today as if I
makeup I see you can't tell but I don't
feel as oily I don't feel as like gross
as I usually do like not I feel bad but
like it just feels better and yes I'm
super excited to keep on using this this
is going to become my everyday foraminal
they also send me like a Jarmo top that
says you're a hangover queen at to face
and I was like we could yeah I love to
face oh thank you so much again for that
parcel I loved it and then I recently
went into the drugstore and did a bit of
shopping myself so I picked up the sleek
makeup palette in Cleopatra's kiss I
love this so much like I probably won't
use the
I forgot what they're called basically
I'm probably going to use the powder
shades but this is such a gorgeous
palette and I love the packaging it
feels so expensive and it's all like
golden metallic enos like shining around
my room but yeah I lived used to love
this so much
I was only ten pounds I then picked up
the brand new collection
primed and ready correct and conceal
palette so how I tried this out yet but
because I love the collection concealer
eyes have gotten interesting that this
is going to be amazing and I know you
can also get these three shades in like
the liquid tube form as well which I'm
definitely going to buy because
collector you can see that you can see
that I've been using for a year like
maybe even more than a year on a daily
basis so this was four pounds and it
says primed already concealer then
you've got your green your purple and I
think that looks like a powder yeah
that's a powder so I'm definitely that
you guys know what I think this if you
want me to do first impressions let me
know in the comments below that I can do
with first impressions on this and
finally the last thing I picked up
makeup wise which I'm obsessed with is
the Laura Mercier translucent powder now
the amount of people that talk about
this powder which is getting too much
and I knew I had to try it so I was in
at John Lewis in Milton Keynes and I saw
they had a Laura Mercier powder powder
counter I was like okay I'm gonna have
to get it so it was 29 pounds but it's
such a decent sized pop for it and I can
genuinely notice a difference in my
makeup my makeup stays on so much longer
now and like this is nothing compared to
any other powder I've tried if you have
already skin like me and you like to
bake your makeup I just bake across here
my chin my forehead I would 100%
recommend this mine is in the shade
translucent so it doesn't think it any
like orange residue like when my other
power to says I think it's someone from
the collection leaves a bit of an orange
residue but this one is perfect and I
love it so much
yeah that is basically the end of my
haul I really hope you enjoyed it if you
do give it a huge thumbs up remember to
go down there below and comment some
video ideas because I'm so littler I'm
such a video block under struggling for
ideas and knowing what you guys want
will help me out a lot so go down there
and do that right now but yet other than
that I love you all so much and I will
see you next week for a brand new video
I love you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
