going to do a high-end vs. drugstore
makeup tutorial so a few weeks ago I
loaded a video where I did a load of
high-end products and I showed you some
really good drugstore dupes for them and
in the coins of that video I'm not
joking with you so many people said
please do a tutorial I actually filmed a
tutorial and I wasn't happy with it so I
decided to give it a different different
go doesn't make sense I decided to redo
it and use different products and I'm
not going to lie I think they turned out
exactly the same the only noticeable
difference I can really see is the lips
but that's because I couldn't find the
perfect dupe color but still I both look
I love both of the colors so I think
it's amazing before I got on into the
tutorial I just really quickly wanted to
say
I didn't use any Brown products because
I actually do nothing for my brows I
just leave the natural and I have to use
a drugstore powder for both sides
because I don't actually own any
high-end powders yea house basically it
I really hope you enjoyed the video and
let's get started so for my high-end
foundation I decided to use the Too
Faced Born This Way this is in the shade
snow and it is a little bit dark for me
as you can see but the coverage is so so
high and I just used my beauty blender
to blend this out and as you can see it
really does get good coverage you can
clearly see the line of my skin before
and my skin after which I know is quite
bad so then for the drugstore side I use
the L'Oreal True Match which is actually
my favorite foundation I think I do
prefer this over the Too Faced purely
because it's a lighter shade and I feel
like lighter shades suit me more than
darker shades I feel like you can
definitely see this throughout the video
but both sides are amazing coverage and
even though they're slightly different
shade they're both amazing so for the
high-end side I then went in with my
NARS creamy concealer which again is a
slightly darker shade I always find that
high-end shades are harder to match to
my skin so again I just blended this out
with my Real Techniques Beauty Blender
it does give very good coverage under
the eyes oh I must admit for my
drugstore side I decided to use the
collection lasting perfection I love
this this is my favorite concealer it's
only 4 pounds I much prefer this over
the NARS
the coverage is so much better in my
opinion it just goes to show you don't
actually need high-end products because
seriously at the moment I'm much
preferring the drugstore side moving on
to powder I actually had to use the same
powder all over my face because I don't
own a high-end powder but nevertheless
this drugstore powder is amazing it's
the l'oreal infallible and it really
does stay matte all day especially if
you dab it in a Beauty Blender and bake
with it oh my gosh it's so amazing if
you do that so moving on to high-end I
use the NARS orgasm blush this is so
pretty it just gives a light natural
flush to your sheets which you didn't
have before and it's kind of like your
cheeks but better if you know what I
mean so then for the drugstore side I
use the best soup in the world which is
the sleek rose gold as you can see it is
literally identical and it's only four
pounds so felt contour I decided to
actually use hoola I never contour in a
video this is the first time so please
do not judge because I never do it and
then for the drugstore side I use the
sleek contour kit I just blended these
out I don't really do it very well and I
don't really do it often but I wanted to
do it in this video as I wanted to give
you a clearer view of what you can get
from the drugstore and what you can get
from high-end so I much prefer hoola I
must say as it does blend out a lot
nicer than the sleek but nevertheless
they're both amazing products so for the
high-end side I decided to highlight
using the mary lou manizer from the balm
this is around 17 pounds but will always
be my favorite highlighter purely
because the pigmentation is so strong
and then for my highlighter on the
drugstore side I used the one from the
sleek contour kit this isn't as strong
and it does take longer to build up but
if you were looking for a starter
highlighter I would definitely recommend
this one
for my high-end side I decided to use
the naked 2 palette for urban decay
this was so much more pigmented than I
thought it was going to be so it took a
long long time to blend out but as you
can see it's a really pretty color once
you have blended it out so for the
drugstore side I use the revolution 32
shadow palette this is a really good
palette the colors aren't as pigmented
but it's only like six pounds which is a
big difference on 40 so I just took a
really similar shade the closest shade I
could find and blended that out into my
crease moving back to the high end I
took a slightly darker Brown and blended
this in the outer V this just gave it a
bit more depth and dimension I did the
exact same with my drugstore side using
the pretty much the same colors and then
I wanted to add a bit of shimmer back
into my eyes so I just use the really
glittery kind of Goldy color but it come
out quite pink because I put it on brown
and again I just did this for my
drugstore side as you can see that isn't
really much different other than the
pigmentation which to be fair you're
paying for because you are paying 40
pounds for Urban Decay and only six
pounds for triple the amount of
eyeshadows from revolution
for more high-end mascara I decided to
use the benefit roller lash this is a
really good mascara if you're looking
for very natural eyelashes but it is
nineteen pounds fifty and I personally
wouldn't say it's worth that because it
started not really to do anything to my
eyelashes compared to the drugstore side
so for drugstore a really good root and
maybe even better is the Maybelline lash
sensational this will forever be my
favorite mascara and I will never ever
fault this it is just so amazing it
makes your lashes so black long thick if
you want them to be it doesn't go too
clumpy unless you put so many layers on
which I like and it's just the best
mascara ever and it's less than half the
price for lips I decided to use the
matte lipstick in velvet teddy I
personally cannot fault that lipsticks
they are so highly pigmented and
especially this one it's a bricky brown
color and it does stay all day without
drying out or anything considering its
matte and a June for this would be the
NYX lingerie lipsticks these are amazing
this shade was push-up and it wasn't
identical Sh match because obviously
drugstore matching to velvet teddy isn't
easy but if you do have a map leave it
down below but it's a very close match
and I actually much prefer the NYX
lingerie lipsticks
so that is the finished makeup look I
personally cannot tell a difference
other than the lips everything comes to
me looks exactly the same so this is the
drugstore side I much prefer this it has
a flawless coverage the colors aren't
overly pigmented they're just perfect
for what I want and this is the high-end
side it's still really good coverage but
to be fair I still prefer the drugstore
so that was the end of my video I now
have it the final price of life the high
inside and the drugstore side this is
the high-end side this is the drugstore
side so this high-end side cost one
other to one pound this high inside it
costs 157 pounds 50 whereas this
drugstore size costs 57 pound 65 I am so
happy because this is literally 100
pounds nearly exactly different and to
be fair they look exactly the same I
think you could definitely tell the Born
This Way has more coverage but that's
because obviously it is triple the price
of the True Match but seriously I mean
that is like an amazing group I'm so
chuffed with that I think that's amazing
and it's just going to show that you
don't need to spend so much money to get
like a real nice makeup look because I
love both of these looks because they're
exactly the same just using different
products so yeah I really hope you enjoy
the video let me know if you did by
giving it a huge thumbs up and I will
see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
