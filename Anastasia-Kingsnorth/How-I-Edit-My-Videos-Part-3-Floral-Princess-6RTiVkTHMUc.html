be the long awaited how I edit my videos
part 3 so I know how much this it's been
requested all of you have wanted to know
how I edit on my iPad because I edit on
my iPad for and I figured out some
really cool tricks you can do on it so I
thought I would finally share them with
you I just want to clear this up I film
on the front camera of my iPad for I'm
filming on the front camera right now
and then to do overlays I'll film on the
back camera I also use studio lighting I
got my studio lighting from eBay for 29
pounds
I will overlay some clips of it and if I
can find it again on eBay I will put the
link in the description box down below
but I also edit on my iPad a lot of
people have started not to believe me
but I genuinely edit on my iPad and I'm
going to show you all of the tricks that
I've managed to find out the first thing
I'm going to be talking about is how I
do my intros and how I add the text
sliding in and everything like that so I
use an app called over video or vaunt so
I recently discovered those two apps and
I absolutely love them my favorite one
is font because it's basically font over
in a video form so that is how I add all
of my overlays so I just choose the text
that I want to add and choose the font
and then to get the background I click
on style and then I go to background and
then I just choose the background I want
and change the opacity and then down the
bottom you could click and effect and
how fast or slow you want it to come in
or how fast or slow you want it to go
out and then I have to save that to my
camera roll and then add it into my main
video on iMovie so you can't like put
the whole video in there and choose
which bit you want to add text on you
have to literally pick the bit you want
to add text on completely put it into
font and then add the text and then put
it back into iMovie I use font for all
of my texts and all of the fonts I want
to use I don't need any other app I do
speak about over video but I much prefer
font so the next thing I'm only talking
about is how to change your thumbnails
on a iphone or an iPad without using a
computer so looking for Luis he has an
amazing YouTube I will link it down
below he's really hosted three case and
make sure you go and subscribe to him he
told me about this app called puffing
free
and it's basically your computer desktop
but on your Apple device or any other
device that you would like so the
address called puffin free and you can
use anything you want on that I just
typed in YouTube and then you literally
see your YouTube desktop so I went onto
my channel and then I de clicked on edit
on the video I want and it will come up
with like different options you can
choose to change of thumbnail and I
literally do it like that to make my
thumbnails I will take the picture and
make a collage in pic collage and then I
will go to Y to Graham and turn the
brightness up twice oh then go into font
oh and add the text and then I will go
back into pic collage and resize the
picture so it just has a little white
border and then I will save that to my
camera roll and then go into puffin free
and put it on and that will be the
perfect size for a thumbnail the next
thing I'm going to be talking about is
the music I use so I use an app called
my media however a lot of people have
told me that they cannot find on the App
Store anymore and that is the app that I
use so I don't know how else you could
get music another thing you could try is
like using your Apple music library and
but basically for my media if you can
find it you can just download a song so
I will go into the web search I'll start
a song I want on Google and I will copy
and paste the link then I will open a
youtube converter and paste the link in
that like little box and I will say
convert the video to mp3 and there's a
little sign that says that and then I'll
save that to my my media library and
then when you go to your my media
library you click on the little eye and
you say open in other apps and then it
will say open in iMovie so I open it in
iMovie and it will say choose what movie
you want to open it in and you choose
what movie you want to open it in and
that is how I get my music the main
editing app that I use is iMovie and I
will do all of my voiceovers on there
and all of the main editing so for the
voiceovers you just place a little line
where you want to start the voice over
and you click this little microphone on
your Play screen and it would just say
recording in 3 2 1 and then you record
your voice over before my set up I have
a tripod that I actually got for my
birthday but I believe it was from eBay
or somewhere like Curry's because my dad
got it for me but I'm not a clue where
from but I just have my tripod there and
I got IPAN attachment from my dad for my
birthday as well
but I do know that I'm either
Amazon eBay and if I can find it I will
link it down below so I have that right
in front of me and I can literally see
myself filming so it's really really
easy and they're standing behind that I
have my studio light and again I spoke
about that I'll try and link that down
below so if you want to overlay a clip
over the main video you put the main
video in iMovie and then you go to the
video you want to add you just click it
on the little sidebar and you click the
video and then there'll be three dots
and you click the three dots and there
is three options where you can put the
video so you can either put it in a
little square on the screen half side of
the screen or completely over the screen
so I always use completely over I may
show you how to do the side and the
little square might overlay a clip of
how to do that but yeah that's basically
how you do an overlay so back to the
music so you don't get copyrighted music
I would recommend speeding it up so you
click on audio and then you click on
speed and you can either slow it down or
speed it up it is completely up to you
but that will make the music non
copyrighted now on to end cars so why do
for my end card is I will find the
YouTube logo or the Twitter logo on
Google Images and I will save it
I will then going to pick collage and
put them in a line and basically set out
how I want the endcard I will just make
a complete end card on there add my name
add my Instagram but I will leave a gap
where I want to put a video and then I
will save the image and I will go into
iMovie and at the end of my video I will
just put add image and I will make the
image - it doesn't move and you
basically have two icons and what you
have to do is you have to squeeze the
video or the picture so they're exactly
the same so you have to keep clicking on
one move the picture how you want it
click on the other move the picture you
want it and till they're exactly the
same and once you have done that I will
go on to like the line put at the start
of the picture and I will go and put a
video clip of my last video so I will
click the last video clip of my video in
like the choices of the video and I will
click the little square again the three
dots pick the square and then once it
adds it in I will move the square into
the position I want it on the picture so
in my iMovie I have no idea why but you
can't speed up you can only slow down so
to slow down you just click on the video
and speed and you can slow it down as
much as you want but if you want to
speed it up I basically have to use an
app called slow up or slow down I can't
remember
I will show you what it looks like on
overlay and I just have to put the video
in there and speed it up there and then
one time to spread it up twice while I
put it back into iMovie the speeder
options will like appear so I have no
idea why it does that but that is how I
speed up and down that is basically
everything I do to edit my videos I will
overlay loads of clips of how I film
them and how I do all of that as well
so I hope you have enjoyed this video I
know it was long awaited but I just
wanted to wait until I hit 20k which
thank you so so so much I literally
cannot believe I'm at 20,000 subscribers
that is absolutely insane and I cannot
thank you all enough so I hope you have
enjoyed this video please the other big
thumbs up if you would like me to keep
doing these like part four and five and
I'll see my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
