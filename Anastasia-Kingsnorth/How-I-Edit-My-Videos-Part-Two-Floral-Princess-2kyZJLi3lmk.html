my how I edit my videos so this is
actually going to be my 9k video but
when I upload this I don't know if I
would have hit it but hopefully I will
hit it overnight so I just want to start
off by saying thank you so so so much
for 9 K I can't believe how crazy is
that I'm already at 9 K it's absolutely
amazing so thank you so so much so I
have found out some more tips and tricks
to do with iMovie so I've got are we
doing a part 2 and when I hit 10k are we
doing a giveaway so when I hopefully hit
11 K if I do then I will do a part 3
with more tips and tricks that I have
found so I've downloaded a load of apps
in here which are the new apps which I
found out how to do tips and tricks with
so if you want to find out how to do
some more tips and tricks then carry on
what I'm going to be showing you it's
called slow fast so this is a speeding
up and down app and I basically use this
because on my iPad when I actually edit
on my iPad it doesn't let me speed up it
only lets me slow down so I'm just going
to pick a video I actually just filmed a
clip of my room to show you and it will
basically speed it up and you can just
keep speeding it up by keeping
compressing the video and I'll just add
it in that way so you press this little
button here it is a free app and then
you just press play and it will speed it
up and then you can just save it and add
it into your camera roll as know I'm
doing showing you is font candy so first
of all before I use this app I will go
into iMovie and I will screenshot
something from my video so say I want to
add a title I will stop it where I want
to and slice my finger down it and then
I will screenshot it and then I will go
into this Apple font candy I actually
did this but I did it on font I but a
lot of you are asking how I got the
opaque like background so I'm just going
to library okay then click the
screenshot and then I'm just going to
click OK and then ok so you double tap
to add text and then just I'll just put
like hello
and then you could resize it and move it
around so this is how I get that opaque
and then I just click this little um box
down here and then I can change the
opacity of it so it can be like really
clear and then you can actually change
the color of it as well which i think is
really cool so yeah you can do all these
different things with it which I really
really like and then or also you can
like change the font as those two
different fonts you can do so then I'll
just click that and then I will save it
back to my camera roll and I will go
back into iMovie and I will add it in to
the place where I see and a lot of you
were asking me how I make my pictures
stay straight so you have to use these
two little icons here so i zoom out as
far as I can clicking on both of them
and then they should hopefully stay in
the same place and then as I do this it
will stop and you text will come on it
so I really really like how this looks
and it is personally one of my favorite
fonts types I've been using me showing
you is how to add like the slides with
the picture of the makeup item on with
some text so first of all I will go to
the Internet but I've actually got my
phone on airplane mode at the moment so
I don't get any updates while I'm
filming but then I will go to not font
Oh pic collage and I will resize the
photo make sure the photo what you save
off the internet has a transparent
background and then I will add the photo
and I will change the background to
white and then I'll resize it just so it
fits in the left-hand corner and then
I'll go to font o add it and add the
text like a picture and then I will add
it wherever I want into iMovie so it is
actually a picture that I make it's not
like a video I'm showing you is in
iMovie and it's how to do a voiceover so
I literally just click this little
button here and but before you click it
you have to make sure it's in the place
you want it so you just scroll it along
and then press record I'll say recording
three two one and then it will start
recording you just press stop accept or
you can retake it and then it will take
it from that place there so that's
basically how I add a voice to make an
end card so a lot of people ask this
question again basically I saved the
pink logos
of the apps of Google and I made it in
font oh and pick collage I put the
images on pic collage to the left hand
side I went into font oh and added all
of the text and left a space for my
video to put when I'm in Ireland in
iMovie this is another frequently asked
question on my previous video I save in
1080 P which is the highest quality you
can get and when I upload I upload in
the biggest HP and biggest HD I can get
it does take a little bit longer but it
gives it really good the last frequently
asked question was where is the like
swirly font on font oh so I actually had
to download it from the internet so if I
just use a plain image use so I will go
and press add text and mine is just in
this looks like my font part because I
downloaded it from the internet typed in
signera
font and it came up with a load of
different website and I clicked when
they said download and then it said
download into font oh so now I have a
cig merica and it's just like a really
swirly phone and it's like one of my
favorite fonts ever
yeah sorry they're just like a random
letters but yeah this is basically how I
get the signal about everything for my
part - of how I edit my videos if you
would like a part 3 and if you enjoyed
it please give a big thumbs up and
comment down below some more questions
if you have any and I'll be doing them
like answering them in part 3 and
hopefully I will discover some more ways
to make iMovie videos on an iPad or
iPhone amazing so thanks for watching
guys thumbs up if you enjoyed and thank
you so much again for 9 K hopefully bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
