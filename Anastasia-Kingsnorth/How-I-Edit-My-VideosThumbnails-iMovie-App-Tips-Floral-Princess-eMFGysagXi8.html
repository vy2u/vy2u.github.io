doing my most requested video ever and
it is my how I edit my videos so I just
want to start off by saying thank you so
much for 7k I actually can't believe
that I've hit 7k like it is crazy but I
know you guys don't want to hear me
babble on so I'm just going to get
straight into the video wanna start off
by saying that I actually do edit my
videos with my iPad but because I also
film with my iPad I obviously have to
film now on my iPad so I'm just going to
be showing you everything that I do
normally on my iPad but on my phone so
because I feel my iPad and I needed a
tripod I actually have an iPad 4 tripod
so I had a normal tripod and I ordered
the iPad 4 attachment from eBay and I
just attached it on top so that is how I
can get all good camera angles and
everything like that so yes I have an
iPad 4 tripod to film my videos with so
these are the six apps that I use for
all of my editing I don't so much use
Pixar I will use that for my Instagram
pictures if you would like to see how I
edit my Instagram pictures please let me
know but I'm going to first of all show
you how I use pic collage to make my
thumbnails so I'll first of all just
kind of pick some photos that I like
like just here I screenshotted all of
your amazing edits from
Instagram and I just put them into like
a and border and then I will save it so
let's just say I'm saying it and then I
like to go to whiter gram and I like to
turn the brightness up so this is what I
will do for every single one of my
thumbnails I just come to whiter gram
and I turn the brightness up twice but
and then I think it looks really nice
like that
always do your commenting edits much but
normally on a thumbnail you would and
then I will head over to phonto and I
will add my text so I will go to photo
albums camera roll choose the Edit
and then it's loaded then I'll go to add
text and then I will just add anything
so I'm adding a load of emojis and some
random letters and then I will just pick
a font these are some of my favorite
fonts just in case you wanted to know
they won't have been trying out recently
so you signera cook it's one of my
favorite ones
then I'll just kind of lay it over thee
some now and yeah that's how I make my
thumbnails and I'll just to get it onto
the computer I will mail it to myself so
I'll just like mail it normal and then
the next thing I'm going to be showing
you how to do is how to edit your videos
so this is iMovie and it's what I use to
edit my videos so if I go to new movie
create movie I just choose the simple
theme and then so I wanted to go in
focus and then I'll just go to this
little button down here I'm pretty sure
you know how to do this and I'm just
going to click the clip of me Lily and
under meeting okay so here is this clip
and lots of you wanted to know how I add
text so how I our text is I will choose
where I want to add it and then I will
slice it down and then I will screenshot
it and then I will head on over to font
oh and I will open it in font art and I
will actually add my text here so say
I'm just going to put a note on the lily
male put um meeting so I'll just put
meeting goes anywhere like that and then
I'll just turn the size down and do as
many fonts as I want and I'll just put
it there and then I will go back and
save it and then I'll go back into
iMovie
and I will go to photos camera roll and
I will click it here
and it will go in the middle and then I
will change this bit to the slide II
thing and then I will zoom in so that
you can't see any of the buttons anymore
and I will do it on both this little bit
so this is how you get it to not move by
the way and I just keep doing this until
it fits like perfectly with um the one
on the screen obviously nan is a bit
easier when I do it on the iPad but that
will do and then as you see it probably
won't be the best but it will kind of
just move into it and then it will pause
and then it will move out and the clip
will carry on playing so that is how I
add text so you also wanted to see how I
do my end card so I won't show you my
actual end card because that is on my
iPad if I just pick a picture so I'll
pick my Instagram picture and I add it
in here it is so I will choose where I
want to add my little overlay clip so
say I want to add it here I'll go to
here videos and say I want to overlay a
map clip so all of these different
options come up and on an iPad you have
to click the three dots and then these
three will come up and you can either
overlay it completely put it in the
corner whether you want it or half
screen it so I choose this one and I'm
just gonna go on to the ink press the
move around button and I can change the
size of it and move it wherever I want
so normally I will have it just down
here and then I'll just press ok and
then plays the clip will play so I
always say one clip from my previous
videos and now I'm going to be showing
you how I get my music so I get my music
a different way to what most people get
their music so I'd undo this app called
my media and it's where you can get
music for free so here is
Media I'm not going to be able to show
you how I do it but I can explain so
these are just the songs that I have at
the moment and I will go to browser down
the bottom and I will type in the song I
want and then I will copy and paste the
link and then I will go back up here
again and type in youtube converter and
then I will paste the link into youtube
converter and it will say download this
song and I press download and it will
show up in here and then say I want to
use ariana grande I'll just click on the
little I open opening other apps and I
movie but obviously it can get
copyrighted very easy so the way I don't
get copyrighted music is I turn the
speed up or down so I'm going to turn
this speed um like right up wherever
it's gone
yes sir speed and this way it won't be
copyrighted okay maybe just tell my
fellow
yeah that means it won't be copyrighted
so that is how I add my music so I
wanted to add in like the pictures with
text on which I overlay images on or
moving Clips I just make on font Oh
again I just like the fonts on font oh
and there's many different ways you can
do it and I've kind of figured out a lot
of tricks you can do with iMovie now and
another good app for text if you want an
opaque or OPAC opacity I think it's
called background you can use font candy
and I'll use that on a couple of my
holes a while ago so that is a really
good app to use as well
I actually don't upload my videos
through iMovie because I find that takes
absolutely forever so I save my movie to
camera roll in HD because that is how I
get good quality videos and then I will
go to my camera roll like so I'll go to
photos and I'll just click any video in
here see that and then I'll go to this
little arrow down here next YouTube and
then I will upload it to YouTube through
here but I make sure I click HD because
then you will get some really good
quality videos and it won't go fuzzy or
anything so make sure you click HD when
you're uploading I hope you have enjoyed
seeing how I edit my videos it may not
be as interesting as you thought but I
hope it is because I know a lot of you
wanted to know how I got all the text
and everything so please give a big
thumbs up if you enjoyed and yeah don't
forget to subscribe bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
