doing a top for spring hairstyles video
I feel like I haven't done a hairstyle
video in so long so I just thought I
would do one for you but before I do I'm
just gonna kind of talk about like a bit
about my hair so I do have dark blonde
hair it's not quite brown yet it's
blonde but it's very dark blonde and
because I want it to be a lighter blonde
I'm currently using some blonde
highlights activating shampoo so I'm
using the John Frieda sheer blonde
highlight activating moisture shampoo
and conditioner and it brightens a range
of blonde tones so I'm hoping to get
kind of blonde highlights from this like
naturally because it's kind of working
like I don't want to dye my hair but I
want to get highlights naturally so
before this video I just washed my hair
and dried it with a hairdryer and then I
just put some mousse in it and then I
also usually John Frieda highlight
activating hair spray so now I look a
bit about how I prepared my hair for my
hairstyles I'm going to show you four of
my top four that didn't make sense four
of my top spring hairstyles so okay
so for this kind of half-up half-down
kind of look i just started off by
brushing my hair and normally because i
have the middle partner i just sweep to
over some of my hair from one side and
just put a bit more on the other and
then i just pinned a little bit from the
smaller hair side and pinned it back and
then took my fringe and just pin that
back as well and I think this is a
really cute and simple hairstyle and
it's so easy to create a fishtail braid
I just took my hair from the previous
hairstyle and I just pulled it over to
one side and then I got two parts and
split into two and as you can see here
I'm just bringing hair from one side
over into the middle and grabbing it
with the other hand I hope you can kind
of see from my demonstration because I'm
really bad explaining things like this
but I love the end turn out of fishtail
braids and I think they're just so easy
and so pretty obviously you need to get
the hang of it but after you've got the
hang of it you can just do it really
simple and I love them next up is a very
requested hair tutorial and this is the
half-up half-down bun so so LM inspired
this hairstyle and I absolutely love it
I've been wearing it to school recently
so I just took the top layer of my hair
and I just put it all up into a half-up
half-down ponytail I just left quite a
bit of hair down because I only wanted a
thin piece of hair to do the donut with
so once I've done that I just twisted
the ponytail round and I just wrapped it
round it like it self I don't know I
guess that's what I done and obviously
it sticks up really bad so first of all
I just held it down with a bubble and
then I just got a ton of bobby pins and
I just push it down to my head and hide
the bobby pins and that's the hairstyle
done I just love it
finally are these on top French braid so
I have no idea how mine don't go
underneath them they go on top but I'm
just gonna show you how I did it anyway
so I first of all just picked up three
pieces of hair and I plaited them all
normally three times and after the third
time I began to pick up hair on every
strand so when I before I would like
plat the hair I would pick up a piece of
hair and I will just plat this all the
way down until it got to the bottom and
then I would just repeat it on the other
side and I think this is a really good
hairstyle for sport and I love it thank
you so much for watching thumbs up if
you enjoyed and I'll see you in my next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
