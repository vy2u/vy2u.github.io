doing a how to start a successful
YouTube channel so when I was starting
out with YouTube 18 months ago
I always watch these videos to get ideas
on lighting video tips filming tips
everything like that as I really had my
heart set on being a youtuber and making
videos because that is what I love doing
so I thought I would kind of like gather
all of my tips together that I have
picked up along the way I guess and put
them all together in a video to help you
guys if you are making videos like
anything been on YouTube for like 2 or 3
years this video can still help you
because it can I don't really have a
reason I have like the reasons in my
head but you know when you just can't
like work them properly that is what's
happening in my head right now but yeah
so in this video I'm gonna kind of talk
you through some like making a channel
banner a photo video tips lighting tips
software editing everything like that
just to kind of give you an overview of
my youtube journey and how I've made my
channel how it is today also my call in
this video successful I'm not saying
that my channel is like a huge YouTube
successful channel I'm just saying that
I am kind of giving you the tips I've
picked up along the way and I now have
115 thousand subscribers which is
absolutely incredible and I'm so so
grateful because 18 months ago that was
like a dream and to think that this
dream came true is just like
mind-blowing so yeah I'm just gonna get
straight on into the video before I
start rambling because I can tell that's
what I'm probably gonna do so the first
thing to talk about is actually making a
channel with like a header header banner
channel art and a fun time so a channel
art and having like a proper
professional photo is really important
because it's kind of the first thing
people will see when they click on your
channel the big banner at the top and a
photo of you so I think that's really
really important
even if it's like a selfie of you or a
picture you're taken that you just
really like as long as you have your
face in it I definitely would use one of
those pictures because you can show
people that you really mean business and
the YouTube thing just by having a
proper profile photo and I always look
for good profile photos and like scroll
into people's comments to find new
youtubers that is like the first thing I
look for and then
having a nice banner you can I mind it
just really pay it's like white with
like floor princess on it because that
I've just kind of got my channel name
that represents my channel but you can
go like really out with your banners
like Alicia Marie and the Lamia makeup
have amazing ones which oh my gosh
they're so beautiful
mine is really plain but a good channel
art like a good professional channel art
is really important I'm a client on
PicMonkey on like my laptop I will just
get the YouTube banner template outline
and I will just like kind of make it
alright so I'll turn it why are ad text
I'll add shapes you can add photos you
could add your social media icons you
can do everything like that
and yeah I make my own pick a monkey
because that's the easiest thing I will
link the photo to like the youtube
banner template down below because that
is so helpful when I found that I was so
happy but yeah banner and photo are
definitely two really important things
to having a successful YouTube channel
the next thing is camera and filming
equipment so as most of you guys know or
maybe you don't know maybe you joined my
channel like a few months after this but
I actually used to film on my iPad I
fell on my iPad 4th generation from when
I started YouTube until I had about
60,000 subscribers which I loved doing
because I didn't at time think I needed
a camera to do it I wasn't you know what
I'm gonna do it with my iPad and I love
them with iPads and when I watch
people's videos with an iPad alright wow
that it's amazing because how I just I
think is amazing like you don't have to
have a camera to to do a YouTube channel
obviously as you do get bigger maybe you
want to make more professional videos I
would definitely recommend getting a
DSLR camera I have a Canon EOS 700d
which is perfectly fine for me I don't
need to change the lens I don't need to
change anything about it I'm just really
happy with having a camera just to film
on because I kind of wanted to step up
my videos a bit which is why I did get a
camera but to start off an iPad or phone
is absolutely fine because I'm kind of
in a weird way living proof that you
don't have to have a camera and all
really expensive equipment to like get
subscribers on YouTube I've got a 60
thousand subscribers filming on an iPad
and that was amazing to me
it meant the world to me that people
were doing it and it really doesn't
matter if you don't have all the special
equipment at the start as long as you
are making videos and enjoy what you do
that's fine but also have a tripod I've
got the valve on df5 one tripod my dad
got me this for Christmas last year in
2014
yeah in 2014 and I've had it ever since
it fitted my iPad because I had an iPad
attachment and now if it's my camera but
I would definitely recommend this tripod
if I can still find it I'll link it down
below but I'm pretty sure they're only
about 15 20 pounds to buy so it's really
good because it's a lot better quality
than the one I had previous the next
thing is lighting though my biggest tip
for lighting is use natural lighting but
I can't use natural lighting because the
way my room sets up my window is here
and I would have to film like there to
my room and I don't really like how it
looks because my walls are like cream
they're not white and it just wasn't a
nice setup therefore I use studio
lighting I only have one studio light
because my room is way too small to have
to in I can never use to to film a video
I would just be like clad with stuff but
mine was about 25 pounds I think from
eBay and it is lasting me so long like
the bulbs smashed once but that wasn't
my fault mum smashed it so I had to get
any Bowl but the actual like set up the
tripod the softbox part the cover
everything works perfectly and it just
plugs into a plug socket and I switch it
on and it like makes the lighting change
so much it's really really good so if
you can't use natural lighting if your
room just doesn't have very good natural
lighting definitely recommend these soft
boxes again they're only like 25 pounds
or sometimes you can get like two for 30
pounds so they're really really good and
they last a long long time as well
editing software so a lot of people on
YouTube and it on either Final Cut Pro
or iMovie on a MacBook however even
though I do have a MacBook now and that
was actually kind of one of the reasons
I got one so I could edit on it I still
don't get it on my iPad have a leave
that connects straight from my camera to
my iPad as I cut that is how I've grown
up on YouTube editing my iPad and I
don't want to change that because I love
editing on my iPad I have so many tips
and tricks that I've learned now how to
add pictures effects text every
I use a few different apps but in the
main I use like to edit oops
this video is iMovie it's for power 52
buy on the App Store and it is the best
app I've ever had
I just and all my videos on it they're
constantly adding new things like
effects you could speed up and slow down
videos so yeah I will edit on my iPad
but of course obviously if you do want
to up your editing game or when like you
do feel like it's the right time you
could get Final Cut Pro or iMovie on a
macbook I do have my movie on my macbook
but I just don't use it but you could
get Final Cut Pro it's about 200 pounds
to buy and I find it's so confusing to
use but it's still a really handy thing
to have there so yeah editing software I
use iMovie video ideas now I find video
ideas so so hard because I don't want to
always do videos that everybody else is
doing I want to start to be more
original and do other video ideas but it
is so so hard in the YouTube community
to do videos that haven't already been
done and it's so annoying because
there's so many videos out there that I
would love to do but sometimes I just
not happy with the turnout so video
ideas my biggest tip is to go through
people's channels and scroll right down
to the bottom and look at the videos
that they used to do because often the
videos that were done way back like a
few years ago videos that could be
really good now and you can really enjoy
filming so that's my biggest tip the
video ideas going down people's channels
and look at their videos zoom in
background so I think it's really
important to have like a set filming
background so as you can see I just have
like some candles up here I have some
flowers here it's literally just my
dressing table and I just sit in front
of it because I like how it looks it's
pretty and girly and I like pink and
white I definitely recommend having a
good swimming background I always think
that like candles are really pretty at
the back of the filming background so
that is my biggest tip add some candles
maybe some flowers just make sure it's
clear and it just kind of looks nice
with your lighting and I don't know just
make it very clear and simple my next
thing is thumbnails and my thumbnails I
do add an effect on them I make them a
bit lighter because that's me and that's
my channel I love doing that and I don't
really want to change that because to me
it's more original now because the
not really many people doing it anymore
and when I'm scrolling down a video like
a video lift these thumbnails will stand
out to me and I really like doing them
because that's me I'm very pink and
girly and I love all of that type of
stuff so I do like kind of wash up my
thumbnails a little bit but then I add
like bold writing to make them stand out
I recently started to do like block font
as I could pink matte brown and I love
doing that yeah so now is a really
important part of the video because
they're the things that people will see
first and that will kind of determine
whether or not they click on the video
so definitely spend a widen your
thumbnails because I think that's really
important so Natalie I just have some
tips and tricks for you so the first one
is about subscribers and now if you do
want to start to gain more subscribers I
would definitely recommend collabing
with people so you come up with your
friends you can find even on Instagram
but also have YouTube and you can come
up with them and that is a good way to
get your channel out there at first just
cut up with loads of different people
and then as you like start to get bigger
maybe just do your videos and you'll
find that you're gaining anyway but the
really good way to start gaining is
definitely through collapse and then the
tip is to do YouTube for the right
reasons make sure that when you're
setting out on YouTube and you're gonna
do it make sure you're doing it not for
the money not for the fame but because
you genuinely love doing YouTube videos
if YouTube like if video is a true
passion of yours and you love making
them then do that but do not do it for
the money or fame because the money and
all of that it doesn't come for a long
long time and yes YouTube does pay some
money from like sponsorships or like
video views but it doesn't come for a
long time
and I would definitely just do it for
the right reasons and you you realize
that when you're doing it for the right
reasons that maybe things will start to
come in more but I would definitely
recommend just doing it because you want
to do it and don't start with a mindset
that I'm doing this to become famous
because it will not work and just do it
because you genuinely love making videos
and my last tip that kind of follows
onto this is be original and be yourself
I struggle with this at the beginning I
always copy people because I don't know
why I did it I just I don't know I can't
you remember why I did it
but now I always love to be original and
I just it's that's how I like to be now
I like to be my own person and I'm
much much happier looking at my channel
with videos that I have made and I have
created because I wanted to so now it's
kinda at the end of my video I really
hope you enjoyed it because I found this
video so helpful when I'm starting out
with YouTube and when I was just looking
for tips and tricks so I'm really hope
