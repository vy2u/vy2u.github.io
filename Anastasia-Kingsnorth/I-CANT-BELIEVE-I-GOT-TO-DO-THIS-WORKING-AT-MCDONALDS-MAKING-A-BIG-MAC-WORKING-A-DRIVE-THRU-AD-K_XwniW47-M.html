So for today's video I am
back and I'm here in my room but in a
different kind of angle which means this
is gonna be a vlog style video and today
I'm so excited because I was approached
by McDonald's. Yes! McDonald's which you
guys know from my vlogs I absolutely
love. To come find out a bit more about
what it's like to work there I get to
chat to some of the people I get to go
behind the scenes at my local McDonald's
and I'm actually going to get to build
my own Big Mac which is literally like a
dream come true that's no word of a lie
I am just getting ready to leave now and
I cannot wait.
I have now arrived at McDonald's now quick story I actually
went to the wrong one but we're just
going to ignore I did that because I'm
here now everything's fine so I'm so
excited here is the McDonald's that I'm
going to be shooting at this is all very
exciting so I'm here to meet Chrissii and
Maddy who have worked here for nearly
two years which is really exciting and
yeah we're gonna be doing some
challenges and basically doing a
load of really fun stuff inside and I'm
also getting to build a Big Mac
Anastasia: Hi! Nice to meet you!
Anastasia: You must be Maddy and Chrissii!
Maddy: We have a uniform for you
Chrissii: And your badge!
I'm like- low key feeling this
(laughs) 
Maddy: Right let's show you the ropes
Chrissii: The first thing you do when you walk into a kitchen is wash your hands
It's so different to what I thought it was going to look like
It's so much bigger as well
Maddy: So if we take you down to the other side of the kitchen where it's not quite so busy
Chrissii: Here are all the buns, the toaster and this is what we call our dressing table
Chrissii: So I'll be showing you that today and you'll be learning how to make your favourite? Is that your favourite?
Anastasia: Yeah
Chrissii: Yeah that's your favourite menu item!
Chrissii: You ready to have a go?
Anastasia: I think so!
Chrissii: Yeah! (laughs)
It's amazing how you know how to do every single one of these burgers
Chrissii: Yeah, doing it everyday- get used to it
It's like second nature isn't it?
Chrissii: Yeah literally.
Anastasia: So I just take the whole one? 
Oh okay so they're cut up- okay!
Chrissii: And then the top bit, the bottom bit and the middle bit go in there
Chrissii: Is that okay?
Chrissii: So that top bit goes in here- just follow the picture
Chrissii: Middle bit goes in here
Chrissii: And the bottom bit goes in here- make sure
Anastasia: This bit here?
Chrissii: That bit just there- Just there!
Anastasia: Oh there's two bits!
Okay I'm too small to see that!
Chrissii: And you've just made your favourite menu item
Anastasia: It's here!
Chrissii:That is literally perfect
Anastasia: I'm so happy
Chrissii: Perfect!
Anastasia: I'm so happy with myself
Anastasia: I literally wanted to make it so neat- I'm so happy with that!
We are going to do a Big Mac challenge to see who can make the best Big Mac
Oh! The burger's coming out
Did I do that right?
Maddy: Oh no!
Anastasia: Did I not do that right?
Maddy: So this bit goes in here...
Anastasia: No! Okay I messed up already!
Maddy: Toasted on both sides
Anastasia: Oh my god it is. Oh yeah because that's toasted on both sides
Maddy: I'll give you another bun
Anastasia: We're going to try that- Take two
It's a lot more complicated than you think
So wait that bit goes in there?
Maddy: So middle bit on the left
Anastasia: Middle bit on the left and ah okay that goes in there
Anastasia: Oh that makes so more much sense with the pictures now
We have all got our Big Macs that we've made and we are going to see who has made the best Big Mac
This is very exciting I loved making
this and now we're going to see who's
the best one. Do you want to go first?
Chrissii: Big reveal!
Anastasia: That's really neat. 
Chrissii: It is pretty good.
Anastasia: That's really neat.
Chrissii: She's showing off for the cameras
Chrissii: Have a bit of lettuce just sticking out here and there you know
Anastasia: Yeah but that's really neat too- that kinda makes the burger you know when you've got a little bit coming out
Do you know what I mean?
Oh I've got a bit of lettuce coming out too
Oh I don't think it's too bad!
Chrissii: You've done really well
Maddy: Considering you've never made one before
Anastasia: Yeah exactly.
Anastasia: I mean, they all look the same- it's just three Big Macs they all look the same but I just-
Chrissii: I think we're going to have to say Anastasia's is the best- I think you've won
In all our time here she's actually beat us
Maddy: She has, she has.
Anastasia: I'm really proud of that. I am really proud of that.
How long have you guys worked here in McDonald's?
Chrissii: So I've been here for two years
Maddy: I've been here for about three and a half-ish
Anastasia: Three and a half years? wow.
Maddy: All through like sixth form and like the start of university
Anastasia: But does working at McDonald's offer the flexibility to be able to do school work whilst being-
Maddy: Yeah, yeah it's really good. All through my A levels they knew just school hours- general school hours
They worked around that
when I got to uni my timetable changed quite a bit more- because that changes a lot as well
Anastasia: It was really flexible around you and your hours which is really good
Maddy: My timetable changes next term and they're happy to change my hours.
Chrissii: They're always accommodating.
That's a really good job to have
alongside while you're doing your schoolwork
You always know there's a chance if you're saying you need to do your schoolwork that you can say: Can I change?
Maddy: Yeah it is super flexible
Have you made a lot of friends working here-like the social aspect of it as well?
Maddy: Massively
Chrissii: Definitely
Maddy: We love everyone we work with
Chrissii: There's always the opportunity to progress at McDonald's
same with the flexibility Maddy is now a shift manager- you get so much support here
Anastasia: Yeah
Chrissii: And training is a massive part from your first shift as soon as you walk in
you're trained on that floor
What made you guys want to apply to work at McDonald's?
Chrissii: I didn't really think about it at first it was
kind of like a big company to work for but
when you actually start working for it you realise there is so much
to do within the stores. I've started an
apprenticeship alongside doing my course with McDonald's.
Anastasia: Just by seeing how long
you guys have been here shows that it's a really enjoyable job- because you stuck to it
Maddy: I wasn't expecting to be here for that long
Chrissii: Me either
Maddy: By the time I finish uni I'd have had a few years management experience and that is a great thing to have
What are some of the main skills that
you guys have picked up from working at McDonald's?
Maddy: Definitely communication skills you really have to in such a fast paced environment
especially when it gets busy as people probably see, you have to really be able to get
your point across quickly.
Chrissii: It's also the teamwork that comes with it so you
can't really communicate properly with
each other if you haven't had a kind of
connection with everyone you work with
so I think confidence as well
those three. Your confidence like your
teamwork communication they all build in
with each other.
Anastasia: Do you feel like your confidence
has grown?
Maddy: Yeah you can't be shy really- I wasn't massively confident when I started
here but it builds and builds and then because obviously you know everyone and then you get used to calling for stuff
Enough with all the questions now we're going to go
to my favourite part which is eating... the burger
I don't know about you but I'm starving
Chrissii: It's beautiful isn't it
Anastasia: It's so good.
How did you learn where everything is?
Maddy: It's not too bad
You kind of learn, again with practice you work out where everything is
Chrissii: You open the window for them, you re-greet your customer and you say hiya or that comes to-however much it comes to
Hiya welcome to McDonald's can I take your order please?
Yep
What drink would you like with that?
Yep
Okay next window when you're ready please thank you!
That was so fun saying that
That comes to £9.58 please
Next window when you're ready please- thank you
Hiya just grabbing your food for you
Thank you hope you have a lovely day!
I am now leaving McDonald's, I have had the best day ever
literally I have loved making Big Macs
It has been so much fun thank you so much McDonald's for having me
