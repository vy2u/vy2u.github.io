today's video I'm doing it's such an
exciting one and I'm going to be
recreating and my old Instagram posts
I've seen it so many videos floating on
YouTube of people copying other people's
instagrams and I was gonna do that but
then I thought to myself I was like no
you know what I've actually got some
pretty interesting photos down life feed
that might be quite fun to recreate so I
thought I would recreate five different
photos recreate the complete look I
actually still has some of the exact
clothes which is so exciting I thought
it would be a bit of a twist on the
trend that is going around so I do hope
you guys enjoy I don't know if anybody
else has done this a few people right
off so I'm not claiming the idea I'd
only be a really good video and I
thought you guys didn't do it yet but
yeah other than that let's just get
started the first photo that I recreated
it was a selfie with the snapchat dog
filter because a lot of my selfies have
the subtle filter on and there's nothing
I could do about it sadly so I'm just
wearing this like green top I've got
pretty messy curly hair and I've took it
in my room so this is me trying to
recreate it so I'm dressed like a look
number one and this is kind of crazy
because I actually do look exactly like
the photo and I've still got the exact
same top I've woken up and I've just
this is my natural hair so I just shoved
it over to one side and then I've done
the exact same makeup so I don't really
have the exact same background as to
what is in the photo but I'm gonna try
my best to recreate the exact position
and obviously it was taken in this room
so you should still be able to see there
with envelopes obviously I'm gonna have
to take this one on snapchat as I do
have the dog filter on as I was obsessed
with the dog filter it doesn't look the
exact same because I think I took that
on a really sunny day and this isn't
sunny so I might have to try and edit
the photo a little bit but I'm gonna
keep trying to see how many we can take
I have taken so many and I thought like
we get into so close but we're just not
there
I actually think it turned out really
well like obviously it's not the exact
because I have grown up a little bit I
do look a little bit older but it was
the best that I could do the only thing
I couldn't get was the Sun across my top
because there was no Sun today it's
pretty mild outside so that's the only
thing I couldn't get but other than that
I think it's pretty
Kirra the original photo was taken on
the 6th of September 2016 so this is 2
years ago so that's my little mini glow
up if I've had one in two years photo
number two was a selfie in the car and I
remember at the time I forget loved this
photo okay I've got this like grey cross
dress on with like a pink waterfall coat
and had the hair French braid because I
loved French braids this photo was
actually taken on the 25th of April 2016
I don't know about you I feel like I
actually managed to recreate this quite
well I'm in the car and it's so strange
because I really do look exact if you
like the photo I've now got my hair in a
Dutch braids in the photo I have French
braids but I can't actually do French
praise myself so this is the closest
thing that I could do I've got the exact
same dress on and then I've got a very
similar jacket and the selfie is just a
normal one of me in the car that I took
when I was at Milton Keynes but
obviously I'm going to be taking it in
my little driveway area
this was actually before the other photo
which I didn't realize that the only
thing like I said I couldn't get was the
French race because I could only do
Dutch braids but other than that apart
from the Sun coming in on my version
because obviously I couldn't stop that I
thought okay actually did quite a good
job I was he let me know what you think
I feel like my face shape has changed
like that's what I'm kind of looking at
on my face shape looks like it's changed
a bit and obviously I've got better I
res now but other than that I actually
thought I forgot it pretty accurate the
only thing that annoys me in my version
is I didn't have mini elastic so I only
have one of them so I had to use a big
chunky hair bubble but other than that I
feel like he looks really really good
and actually goes faster sense is
probably one of my favourite ones that I
recreated the next photo that I decided
to recreate was even earlier and this
was the fifth of January 2016 I've got
this mustard high neck top with my hair
straight and at this time I had really
dark hair and almost looks Brown I was
in the back of the car and I look like
I'm at a petrol station I already know
where I was but again remember like in
this photo so I thought I'd recreate it
picture number three is same position as
picture number two but a different look
or so this photo I don't have the exact
same top still but I've got a very very
similar one so put that on
I would forever put my hair like this
just take the two front bits and bobby
pin them at the back I don't know why I
did it but I feel like everybody went
through that phase where they just did
it this is the photo that I'm going to
be recreating and I'm really hoping that
I can get this spot on I'm gonna try my
best so let's give it a go it's gonna
like mess up my hair and my hand is like
this I reckon I think we've got it I
think we've got that as you can see from
my version it's not again exact like
identical because it's really hard to
get an identical photo but it's a pretty
close one that I could get I've got a
different top on me because I don't
actually have this top but if you guys
have been following me for a long time
like since January 2016 you will know
that I lived in that top like the
majority of my videos that were filmed
in that top apparently I really like
mustard and apparently most it was white
color but I really like that top but
overall I think I did recreate it really
well obviously what makeup I hope it
looks better now but yeah other than
that that was my recreation of that and
I think it looks cool
good the fourth word that I decided to
recreate was probably my favorite one
just because at the time I remember
absolutely loving this makeup look it
was the first time I ever did like kind
of like big bold eye shadow it was a
real first attempt but I remember
thinking Anna you've slashed it babe
this photo I've got this kind of a nude
lace-up bodysuit on again at my hairs
brow it's in a side part in it sweeps
over I actually filled my eyebrows in in
this photo this is why I just started to
fill them in and I don't know the date
of this but it says in the picture thank
you so much for 200,000 subscribers so I
hit 200,000 subscribers around the time
I took this photo I've got this like a
berry lip on and it's kind of like a
burgundy eye so I thought it'd be fun to
recreate where at the makeup stage
should look for look number three I'm
going to be using this lipstick here and
then I've got the exact same palette
that I used in the photo which is the
many mu ax makeup geek palette this look
is that probably my favorite because
this actually does look identical to the
photo I remember when I took this photo
was the first time like ever use the
palette it was the first time I had ever
really done like burgundy eyeshadow so
I've done the exact same is what I did
in the photo I've like cut it and then
I've got the lipstick card got the exact
same top on so fingers crossed we might
be able to get the exact photo I think
that we might have smashed that I
managed to get some really really
similar ones once they've been edited a
bit they actually really look like you
can see I actually did a kind of okay
job on this I actually still have the
same top which looks insane because I'd
really like this top like I won't chuck
it however and I still had the exact
same lip color and the exact same
eyeshadow palette so I managed to
recreate it
pretty pretty similar the only thing I
couldn't get was the exact same angle of
my face I don't know how I should get
all these angles because now I can't do
it maybe it's just a camera I took the
one I took my iPhone X and the cameras
kind of weird on this like it's good
quality but it just kind of like looks
weird I can't explain it if you have
this phone you might know what I mean
but overall I actually really like the
photo that I managed to take and even
though somewhat I'm like my favorite
selfies it's pretty good recreation of
this old one that I really really did
like the final photos take
on the 11th of March 2017 so this is the
most recent ones this was just over a
year ago and I have the same nude
lace-up top on I've got a black choker
which I don't actually have anymore so I
couldn't wear that and I've got my hair
sweet over mum took this photo in my
room and I remember really really liking
it and I've tried to recreate the exact
same makeup which I have on here and I
obviously couldn't find the exact
slashes but these are the closest lashes
I had but at the time I remember loving
this photo and that's why I wanted to
recreate it so this is my final look you
might recognize it from my Instagram as
this is the most latest photo that I'm
gonna do I think this is end of 2016
beginning of 2017 and I've got the exact
same top on as the previous photo and
then I've just got this like orange eye
and I'd actually just scraped the last
bit of lipstick out of the container so
I could get the exact same lipstick but
this photos taking them over and mum
actually took it last time someone was
gonna take it for me again and it's
basically just where I'm standing there
kind of like posing with my room in the
background and it was just a makeup a
photo for Instagram so let's try
recreate it this photo it's probably the
hardest to recreate and I don't know why
because I thought this is gonna be the
easiest because somebody was taking it
off me but it was actually the hardest
voted to recreate I couldn't get my face
in the same angle my body in the same
position as what it was so I kind of
managed to get like a similar one but
not the exact same it's really weird
because I had it in my head that this is
gonna be the easiest so I saved it to
last I was like yeah
sick will do that one last and no it was
not easy at all but I felt like I did an
okay job I mean in the picture I still
look like me now everybody that's kind
of what I look like but yeah obviously
is me like I do look like me but you
know what I mean I thought I could did
okay like it's not my favorite one but I
did okay so that is the end of this
video I really hope you guys have
enjoyed out I really enjoyed filming it
it was something a little bit different
and a lot of you guys like it when I
talk about my younger self so I thought
it'd be quite a good idea just to
recreate my old Instagram photos also
yes I do have a really bad cold right
now if I'm a little bit congested that
would be wise but I love you all so much
thank you so much for watching if you
did enjoy it please smash a huge thumbs
up let's see if we can smash 12,000
likes on it there's a video and um
I love you all so much and I will see
you on Sunday at 10:00 a.m. at a brownie
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
