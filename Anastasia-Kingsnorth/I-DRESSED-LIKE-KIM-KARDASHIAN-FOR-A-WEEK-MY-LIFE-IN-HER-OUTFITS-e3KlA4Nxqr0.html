today's video I am so excited this is
the first kind of video like this I'm
you doing on my channel and today I am
going to be dressing like Kim Kardashian
for a week also two quick things before
I start the video yes I do have a top on
I've got a palm tree like bralette crop
top type thing on that like ties in the
middle but you can't really see below
this part so if probably looks like I'm
just wearing a bra I'm not it is
actually a crop top and also you may
notice that I have a completely
different background and that's because
in my vlogs this week I have been
decorating my room and as you can see it
looks so much nicer so if you do want to
see where I got everything from and how
I decorated it all then you should
definitely check out my vlogs which will
be linked down below and up there
somewhere on the screen now if you want
to go click it like I said today's video
is going to be me dressing like Kim
Kardashian with five different outfits
of hers that I've decided to copy now a
pretty little thing have been amazing
and they've actually sent me some of the
clothes for this video so thank you so
much for letting me let me channel my
inner Kim but I'm really excited for
this video I've seen Roxie do some
similar to like Kylie Jo and ariana
grande but she actually did things that
they would normally do I'm actually
going to be living my normal life whilst
wearing Kim Kardashian's clothes some of
the outfits are like completely fine and
like you probably go out wearing them
anyway but then some of the outfits are
like I would never step foot in Tesco
like that so I hope you guys enjoy if
you do please smash a huge thumbs up and
other than that let's get started we're
gonna start off with the first outfit -
I think he's probably the nicest one
it's the easiest one and to realize it's
something that I would probably wear
anyway this is the outfit that I'm
trying to recreate so the first thing
that I got is from Primark and it's just
a little cropped like no it's not even
cropped is it's just a normal
Navy vest top it was 2 pounds and
literally so expensive and I had this
already so I didn't even need to go buy
it because this is just something that I
probably normally wear anyway and then I
got a similar joggers from pretty little
thing the name you won't actually out of
stock so I had to get black ones but
they've got an elasticated waist band
here which is really nice and then there
just is really thick material and then
at the end you can roll them up so I
actually ended up rolling
like this as I much prefer how that
looks but these are super thick and
super super comfy and then which is the
star of the show
you've got the heels and I had these
already as well they aren't some pretty
little things but they're these kind of
gray greeny like heeled boots the ones
in her picture actually snakeskin but I
couldn't find any snakeskin ones
anywhere and as I really had these I
thought well you know we can kind of
change it up a bit we can wear these
ones the only thing about these is they
kill my feet so when I go out in these I
know it's gonna hurt me a lot but I do
really like them I warned to a benefit
event once and they were really comfy
actually before well they were
comforting about three hours and then
they started tearing my feet but I
really do like them they weren't too
expensive as well and that completes my
day one of Kim Kardashian's outfit the
first outfit is probably actually one of
my favorites because this is definitely
something that I'd usually wear so I've
just got on my top I've got on my
joggers the shoes are quite high and I
have all these to an event before and
yeah they were quite uncomfy after a few
hours but because I've worn them in a
little bit more they actually do look
better now so for my hair I've just got
this straight and I've just popped it
behind my head but I really like these
joggers and I really like them with this
top and I do feel very Kim Kardashian
esque I don't know I like this outfit a
lot as you can see we're now at Vienna
all day without as I've already said I
have sighted off at the easiest outfit
however the shoes that make me feel
extremely extra and I feel quite
embarrassed to be going into being them
like this so let's go the heartbeats
too many cousin my mind I can't sleep at
night so I just keep writing I don't
need no help I don't need opinion so
don't wait for time I just been living
online my city don't show me no nothing
that's fun
the next outfits a little bit more out
there it is a red carpet outfit and it
is this outfit here where she's got on a
silver skirt which she's got like a
massive slit up the leg and they just
got on a white crop top I can't actually
see what shoe she's wearing so I'm just
gonna go with my normal trainers because
I don't think it'll really matter for
this but the first thing that I managed
to get was a bodysuit now I realized
once I bought the skirt that I couldn't
go out in it because it was so
see-through that I needed to either wear
white knickers which you could still see
or I need to get bodysuit so I
compromised and I got a body suit so I
wasn't basically in the nude when I went
out so I just got this a cream a
bodysuit from pretty little thing in a 2
pack I already had it so that was really
good and this is the skirt so obviously
hearses designer like it's probably
Balmain or like something like that I
don't know but I've managed to
compromise and I managed to get this one
from pretty little thing for 25 pounds
and it's so similar it's just basically
got like the squares in the silver
pattern and they also did it in gold and
then it's got a massive slit up the leg
here with like the white hemming but
it's really nice and it glistens really
nicely in the light as well not gonna
lie it's a little bit hard to get past
my bum and it did take some tugging
because I got it in quite a small size
but it is really long so I would go true
to your size if you did want to get this
but I've channeled by any Kim you know I
felt like it was an OK outfit I felt
like I did okay with copying that and
yeah I mean I have to do quite like it
and here is the next outfit which is
quite considerably more dressy than
yesterday's outfit so this is white
skirt and this is just my bodysuit here
as you can see the bodysuit is very
visible through this skirt so you can
only imagine if I left my knickers on as
you can see with this skirt it is quite
long but then I love the slit up the
side even though the slit is quite high
I do really like it so I'm just gonna
wear my normal trainers with this I
would wear heels but I think I'm just
gonna stick with trainers for this one
and then we'll leave the heels for later
on in the week we've now arrived at
McDonald's and this is
for today like I've already said and as
you can see I'm in and went outfit I
come from a town where most of the
people are so closed-minded
they go into school and they work in a
job but they don't even like it I will
be put in the box
nobody telling me what I should rock
nobody we are now waiting for our food
to be honest everybody's we actually
really haven't been as bad as I thought
I think if I come in and like in a time
there would have been a lot worse but we
had to film it in the morning and be yet
people really haven't said that much so
I actually don't feel that bad coming
here at dolls like this I just
personally think kind of like a going to
a wedding so I don't think I look at
that bad and here is my very glamorous
la life breakfast I've got my coke
mama's got a sausage and McMuffin bagel
thingy and then I've got my bacon roll
which to be honest I would much prefer
to eat over probably what Kim Kardashian
is eating right now
the next outfit it's actually probably
one of my favourite ones and it's this
outfit here because it's so basic and
that's what I know the vaccum Kardashian
she'll really either go out there with
the outfit or she'll kind of tain them
down and just wear really casual outfit
so I managed to get basically the exact
same thing from pretty little thing and
it's just a stone maxi we're not max let
me daddy dress I think it's called and
it's all tight and then it just goes
below your knees and I just thought this
was really comfy it's like a slinky
material so it probably will rise up my
legs a bit but I don't think it will
rise up too much because it is super
long when I tried this on at first it
actually came right down to my feet so
that's really good that's exactly what I
wanted and it's very shape hugging and
obviously Kim Kardashian has the most
insane figure so I could see where she
wears these but I really like this and
this is something that I would
personally buy anyway so to me this
wasn't really out of the ordinary but
I've still really liked it so I really
wanted to go out with it for Wednesday's
outfit I've got this one on here and I
really really like this this is actually
I go as far as to say this is probably
up there with my favorite outfits out of
all of her that she's ever wore
it's so simplistic but it's so so comfy
like I was saying it is really
figure-hugging so you can literally see
like your exact figure but it is not
exactly see-through either like you
can't really see many cuz and you can't
see my bra but it is really really
I stress I really do like this and I
think it will probably ride up when I
walk and obviously because of the color
of it might blend in with my skin tone a
little bit but I think it looks really
nice and when I've got my bag on and
stuff I think this is a really good copy
of the one that Kim was wearing now we
have arrived at Primark and I'm in my
outfit and I actually really like this
dress like I genuinely would wear this I
feel like this is more of one of Kim
Kardashian's more wearable looks
especially for the British weather as as
you can probably tell I'm freezing and
it is like spitting rain a little bit
which you definitely would not be doing
in LA so I'm gonna head into Primark and
I was gonna do my cue these are
basically like of Valentino copies and
Kim would definitely be get in the real
ones but um I might be looking at the
fake ones that those are actually really
nice though - do you really like them
these were literally my favorite
sunglasses until I lost them and they're
basically Ray Ban coffees and they're
three pounds how nice are those and
they're going straight in my basket this
is how serious love Island is taken in
the UK okay they're selling at the photo
frames in Primark why my crop is done
and even over so much photo I'm so ready
god this dress to happen the next outfit
is a little bit more risky is literally
this outfit here it's a black maxi skirt
with a bralette and then this kind of
like black overall throw like satin type
thing so I managed to get something
quite similar I couldn't find the exact
but I managed to get quite similar so
I've got this black violet here which is
super super see-through and I am gonna
have to cover my nipples up with this
because it is really see through but
it's really nice it's basically the
exact same one as to what she's wearing
in the picture and it was from pretty
little thing and it was ten pounds and
then I managed to get a skirt as well
which is from pretty little thing and
it's literally just a black maxi skirt I
actually showed this in at my previous
haul what I haven't actually had chance
to wear it yet so I'm very excited to
wear this in this video and it's
literally just called a basic black midi
skirt and I thought this would actually
look really nice right exactly the same
way she has on in the picture for the
jacket this is where I struggled because
I couldn't find a black satin one
anywhere so I already have this black
overall kind of waterfall coat from
pretty little thing which I bought
probably like last year now and I
thought maybe this would work and it's
just like
black overall waterfall code and you
guys will see what I mean when I try it
on it was like 20 pounds and I bought it
which really isn't that bad and it's
basically the same as what Kim's wearing
other than the fact that it's a
different material but this outfit like
I said is a little bit more risky and I
am quite scared to go out in this
because it's quite out my comfort zone
the jacket isn't but the top definitely
is kind of now I personally think this
might be the most revealing outfit I've
ever wore
honestly everything else is completely
fine like the skirt I've got the heels
on the jacket and then the bra I swear
to God if I literally let this coat slip
once my nipples are out literally this
is the most amazing bra left but it is
not giving me any coverage on my nipples
at all and I think that's why I'm gonna
wear this outfit probably to the most
daring place which is Tesco but I'm
gonna cover my nipples up because
honestly I would never go out in this
bra let like ab crop top yes this
brother no for under a top it's really
really nice but just to wear one its own
like this I'm not too sure however the
Alpha is a whole is basically exactly
what Kim wore so I'm pretty impressed to
be fair we've basically managed to copy
the exact outfit for a much much cheaper
price and I actually really do like the
heels the hills are growing on me but
yeah this is definitely the most daring
outfit I would personally say or maybe
the dress will be I don't know but I
think this is quite daring out of all
the outfits
I have to be a bit safe had to be
sensible to me but we are it has been
outright about to go inside we've got a
little
but realize out there and I'm actually
going to see Beyonce in concert I'm
feeling like maybe wearing this outfit
to it like I've done in this lobby now
you're trying to kill Larry be done over
we left
oh hi Anna is that you and the back of a
magazine
what watch is life funny
who's on the back of the magazine
I thought we saved the most daring
outfit until last and that is this
outfit here which is kind of viral when
she wore this and it's this see-through
mesh dress that she wore on the red
carpet she looks incredible she's got
like wet hair which I can't do really
way to attempt it but I can't do and she
just looks incredible and I managed to
find basically the same dress on pretty
little thing here so all that's the
bottom we just get top it looks just
like this it's completely see-through so
I am gonna be responsible and I'm gonna
wear cycle of shorts and a black bra
underneath it so you can't see my areas
but it's literally mesh all the way
through the middle you can have like one
shoulder off one shoulder off like she's
got and this was only 25 pounds and it's
an amazing copy as to what she's wearing
the sleeves are exactly the same even
the bottom where the hinges go kind of
up and then it just drapes down this is
exactly what it does I tried on it I was
like wow I've also got some heels to
wear with it which are gonna be a little
bit more daring and I'm gonna wear these
as well with the previous outfit so
these are see-through heels and in
basically every outfit that I've seen
her wear these had these kind of
see-through he was on with it and I do
actually really like them
apartment this little bit of extra
material here which they probably be a
little bit nicer without but yeah Kim
always wears like see-through heels and
I found some really good ones I'm a
pretty little thing I think they're
about 30 pounds so I'm going to attempt
to wear these with the black dress and
with the midi skirt if I don't wear them
with the black dress that's because
honestly probably well allowed and here
is it my final Kim Kardashian outfit
this is the one that I was most nervous
about and I had right to be because when
I put it on first obviously I didn't
have any cycle shorts on and I didn't
have a bra on
so my nipples and my bum and everything
was on show it isn't as daring as I
thought purely for the fact that I do
have to cover myself up underneath it
but it is actually a really nice dress
and I would probably wear this I mean
Kim pulled it off a lot better than I
did but I was still probably wear it
looking at the detail up close it's a
really really nice dress and I really
like this bit here going to the park in
it I don't know but you know what we're
all up for trying new things here on
this channel and if Kim can do it I can
do it to wear this dress I've actually
come to the park on with my mum and I'm
with Atticus and as you can tell I would
definitely not normally wear a dress
like this to the park this is like a
full-on party dress it's a really comfy
dress like I can see you I can we're
gonna wear this other than the fact that
on the way here my nipple popped out so
mean attica's are gonna play at some
games and I'm gonna test out my sports
skills and see how stretchy the dress is
no bugs nobody telling me what I should
rock nobody telling me what I should
drive cuz I do what I wanna just know by
now start recording tomorrow in the
morning they snore when I pour my soul
in there every story I'm writing
producing that makes it I messed around
building my craft and I'm not looking
back apart from the fact that this dress
is very very see-through I would
actually wear this like me and a saccas
have just been playing with the ball and
it is so comfy to play it I can't get
over it if I was go into an event like
Kim then I would probably go for a dress
like this I'm not gonna lie but to the
park not the best but it was very comfy
and you can move in it you know so that
is the end of this video I really hope
