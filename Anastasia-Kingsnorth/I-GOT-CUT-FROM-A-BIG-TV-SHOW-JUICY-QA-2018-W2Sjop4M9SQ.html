from the show back to my channel so for
today's video I am going to be spinning
the F of T and I'm going to be doing a
juicy Q&amp;amp;A so as you can see I've got my
pink cup here is actually 30 don't
really like to take actually it's full
of water I don't know what it is about
tea I just really don't like it some of
my pink mug I've got my phone and I've
asked you guys for some questions on
Instagram and Twitter ones that you've
really wanted to know the answers to I
picked a few out some of them I just
can't answer but then I have picked some
other ones out there pretty pretty good
questions and I'm gonna be spinning the
tea are some situations that you guys
have really wanted to know about I hope
you guys enjoy if you do please smash it
a huge thumbs up let me know if you want
me to do more Q&amp;amp;A jazz I feel like this
is the best way for you guys to get to
know me and it's kind of the only way
other than my daily vlogs once a day
vlogs they will be tuned daily vlogs I'm
trying to get back into it for the
summer but yeah if you don't already
watched my flow so you just watch our
main channel then this is the only kind
of way you get to know me so I thought
it'd be really good video so I hope you
guys enjoy and let's get started also
first question I'm probably gonna get
our asses
Anastacia do you have freckles no I do
not I drew them on if you can still see
them I just thought they were really
really cute and people have been doing
at the moment and I was like I want to
jump on that trend the first question is
coming from Twitter and it says what age
do you think you will move out now this
I got this question a lot about moving
out honestly I don't know what I'm gonna
move out I don't know if I'm ready to
move out yet I'm telling 18 in October
and is something that I've thought about
like do I want to leave home honestly I
don't think so yeah obviously in the
future yes within the foreseeable future
I don't know I've spoken about moving
out before being suffer spoken about
moving out as well it's just I think
it's just a difficult situation whether
we're actually gonna do it when we want
to do it I may be thinking maybe next
year maybe towards the end of the year
maybe in the following year but at the
moment no I don't think I'll be moving
out I'm still only 17 and I'm kind of
just loving life living at home I don't
really want to leave my mama don't leave
my little brother like not for a long
time
no honestly I don't they called me about
yeah the next question is first
boyfriend now I can't remember if I
haven't told you guys his name I'm not
really too bothered about hiding his
name I don't know if he would really
care my first boyfriend was called Jack
he was also my first kiss and we went
out in like year three four time and
then I had a boyfriend called Michael we
went out for like a year
in year five I think we broke up before
year six the next question I was like
this is really interesting that they've
put this they said do you feel proud of
yourself for being famous now I wrote
this question and I was like why I know
I'm not famous people know who I am and
I make youtube videos and like yeah
people do stop me in the street and ask
for a photo but I'm not famous I would
never call myself famous and the
question was do you feel proud and I
think I feel proud of the fact that I've
gained people's trust to trust me and
I've gained people's love and people
want to see what I'm doing and people
have an interest in my life I'm proud of
that because I think that's such a cool
thing that people want to know what I'm
doing and they want to know what I'm
wearing and I think that's really cool
that I've managed to gain people's trust
famous I'm not face I don't know that's
a really big question like it's a good
question but I was just started they're
really thinking about it I was like when
I was younger I never thought I was
going to do this I honestly like YouTube
it was around but it wasn't a job or a
career path but I was thinking about
what I wanted to do with my life so
honestly I have no idea yeah I guess I'm
proud of the fact that I've actually
brought up an audience of people who
hopefully like me and I enjoy watching
my videos I'm really proud of that
the next question I've been asked so
many times on Instagram on Twitter
wherever I guys ask you and it was a
situation of Jordan I did actually clear
this up last time Ben Jordan aren't
dating we've never dated he asked me out
on a date in a video when he was like
doing prank calls and stuff and because
we've spoken like we spoke before that
video for like three or four months just
like that quiz but like forward and
backwards messaging and we got along
really well that's why I said yes like
we weren't like talking or I don't think
we were but that's why I said yes but no
now we still do talk occasionally and we
do have like conversations and stuff but
know this I think going on with Jordan
it's really weird because people keep
asking me that and that's probably the
most common question I've been asked and
everybody's still
Jannis Asia so yeah I'm not sure why but
no there's nothing going on the next
question is this is a question that a
lot of YouTube - voyage I'm not going to
avoid it but I'm going to try and
explain it it's that my shoe get Paige
are you happy with your pay Pearson love
your videos thank you and yes I'm very
happy with my pay because I know I'm
extremely fortunate to be in the
position that I am how much that's
something I would never share that's
just because I feel like it's personal
for me every youtuber and a different
amount of money a good video I feel like
why is it Caspar Lee when he was talking
about like so he's that makanda and
money and he admitted that by the time
he was 21 he'd got a million pounds and
I feel like that's quite a good
indication of how much youtubers can
earn I would never say how much I do it
just because that is my private
information and you wouldn't find a lot
of youtubers telling people how much
they earn like everything I was really
cool but Casper said that he earned a
million by the time he was 21 like it
obvious that a big big youtubers event a
lot of money like obviously you can see
that like the houses Oh an alpha living
and like the things that people have
done and like also you can see people
and a lot of money but I would never say
the distinctive amount to everybody
maybe I will someday but not right now
all I'm only seventeen I'm just trying
to like get my career going and figure
out what I want to do the next question
is have you ever had a thing with a
youtuber kind of but there's been like a
few different youtubers that I've had
little things with I don't really know
like I don't want to go into detail
obviously one was pretty much
broadcasted like everywhere because I
was in some of his videos it like
started off loads of rumors and stuff
that came to a swift end I've spoken to
a few people yeah one day it will be so
funny if everybody just sat down and
admitted who they've got way then like
all the situations that happened I feel
like you guys would absolutely love it
and he felt I would love to see a video
like that the next question is when you
were younger did you ever expect to be
this successful and what were your
initial career aspirations when you were
little so when I was little like I'm
gonna say little when I was starting
YouTube I definitely did not expect to
be where I am today I felt like I struck
so lucky I put so much hard work in but
I really did strike lucky in the fact
that you guys still want to watch my
videos Anika
you aim to grow with me when I was ill I
always wanted to be a mi5 agent and I
still would like that's my dream job I
want to work in the government I would
have loved to have become a secret agent
like every laughs at me but I'm like no
babe I actually wanted to do that I
still would love to do that but yeah
like I'm really really proud of her I
got because I did not expect it at all I
had no idea that it would end up me
being able to do this at 17 and live the
experiences that I'm doing I just find
it insane this kind of light goes off
the other question are there any
downsides to being youtuber and do you
ever get awkward when meeting friends
unexpectedly like in a shop for example
the only time I said was when you're
eating food this happened quite a lot
and when I move like my family and stuff
I want to be able to like sit down at
the dinner table and have like a family
conversation I don't mind it but just
when I'm eating I like that kind of a
bit awkward I've heard a lot of other
people say that as well at the top
question on Instagram is can you explain
your family situation and whereas your
dad and the story behind it so I think I
have explained this before in a vlog but
never in a main Channel video so
basically I never knew my real dad like
my blood dad growing up of him and my
mom split up when I was in my mom's
stomach and I haven't ever seen him
since and then my mom met my stepdad who
I called dad
they met like when my mom was pregnant
they were next-door neighbors they got
together a few years later they got
married and he was like he's basically
like my dad and calling dad they split
up I think in 2008-2009 in my bin 2010 I
honestly can't remember and then after
that I still see him I still see him now
and I call him dad we message every day
so basically that's my family situation
and now I live in a house with my mom
and my little brother my little brother
has a different dad and my mom had a
boyfriend at the time and they had
Atticus but then it all got together
what happened to your prom documentary
like this is where I'm screwing the tea
okay so I get so many questions about
this and I've never had an opportunity
to explain what on earth actually
happened if we take it way back so when
I made a video at the end of 2017 it was
caught my 2017 and rewind I was telling
you guys that around prom season I
filmed this documentary and it was meant
to be it was really really good I love
and I'm not gonna say the name of the
channel it was meant to be on but it was
meant to be on a very big mainstream
channel that I'm pretty sure you watch a
lot of your favorite shows on I have got
an email through to my business email I
want to say in March April last year so
it was over a year ago and it was from
the casting director of this show saying
that they'd found my channel they've
really liked my personality and they
wanted me to be a part of this TV show
so I was like oh my gosh that's so cool
like it was such a cool idea was all
about prom and I was like this is gonna
be amazing so I had a Skype meeting with
the producer the casting director and a
lot of people on a scrap meeting and I
got casted the next day they really
liked me they loved my mom they loved my
little brother they loved my friends so
we got casted is that main person that
they were following but also all of my
school friends and I had a massive and
friendship group at the time my
friendship group wasn't what it is now
so we've kind of like all gone we
haven't got off our separate ways but
like few of us don't really talk anymore
so when I go casted obviously I have to
tell my friends and they were so good to
me like they were so happy for me they
were like of course we'll do this for
you like they did they've literally put
their prom at risk for this TV show for
me for my career and that meant the
absolute world to me then as it was a
massive deal they had to come into my
school because they were gonna be
throwing at my school they spoke to the
head teachers head assistants basically
- spoke to everybody high up at the
school said like would you be able to
film
Anastacia we did like it was so like it
was so cool filming it like when we were
filming it we had to pretend that we
were coming out of our exams and we were
like doing a little bit of acting and
stuffing there's a documentary it was so
much fun and we had like a lot of fun
doing it but the thing is we revolved my
prom and our prom around filming this TV
show so when we went to book our
transport all my friends I'm in the
middle of gtcys all my friends around my
house on my bed and we hope we were all
being filmed by a massive TV crew
picking up prom transport and they
filmed arguments and they don't drama
and it would have been really good and
then on actual prom day it was so hectic
like we went round there filming
schedule like everything I
it was based around them but got ready
at Tanisha's house my allotment Anita's
mom worked closely with all the
producers and honestly like they just
kind of controlled the whole of our prom
at which if it was aired and we had
something to look back on fair enough
but the fact I have nothing to show for
it really annoys me I also forgot to
mention that when they went to my school
they also asked if there was any other
people they think should be in the
documentary and my friend Joel got
scouted and he has a part in it and he's
part actually got casted so if you can
find it you can go watch it and I'm
actually in his part and at the time but
like I was friend if I'm doing all Devon
then but like we were like best friends
but now we're like in a friendship group
said they weren't in my part they were
in Joel's part so you've seen them in
Joel's part and then basically so prom
happened I was pulled out of problem for
two minutes to answer questions and I
missed like a good hour of my prom and I
didn't get any group photos with my
friends because I was filming and that
breaks my heart because of my friends
pictures and all their memories some of
them I'm not there for even though I was
there so that's really really upsetting
and then we finished they filmed after
party that wasn't on my part of the TV
show that was on Joel's part so again
that didn't get aired if you want to go
for an that and then after that day they
came round once to finish like my part
of the show and they just after said
like some final questions they filmed me
non moment Atticus all in the park and
stuff it was really good and then my
person that my contact at the place I
was talking to said okay you'll hear
from us nearing the time when we're
gonna start to promote the show so you
can tell everybody about it I was told
it was gonna air in January so it was
getting to late December and I thought
this is really strange I haven't heard
anything none of my friends had heard
anything and then I thought okay I'm
just gonna drop her a text and I said
hey like do you know when the show is
airing she had no idea she was like yeah
it should be airing soon like I don't
actually work there anymore but I will
let you know I'll put like a message
forward to the producer so he'll give
you a call if you guys follow my vlogs
in January I was extremely ill after
after New Year's I don't know if it was
New Year's that did it to me but after
New Year's for like two weeks
I was solidly ill like I've never been
that ill before I got a call and I just
honestly I was really ill and he was
like hello
you say it on an unknown it was like if
the producer of did a desert and I was
like oh hi and he was like so we've
actually decided to cut you from the
show and I sat there and I was like what
because I'd been seeing advert and all
my friends are meeting effort and loads
of you guys have been seeing outfits
tweeting me saying why aren't you in it
like why is everybody else in it and you
on because some of my ug friends are
also in this show and I was like that's
a really good point why aren't I in them
and I got so upset when he said to me
that I'd been cut from the show because
I was like what like we did so much fun
when we did hours of filming my friends
gave up so much but my family gave up so
much I gave up my whole prom and I
didn't film any of it because I thought
they were filming it and I was like okay
then so I got my mum to ask why and it
now roundabout way it was basically
because we didn't have enough drama and
they just didn't think I was the right
fit well honey they casted me I was like
are you actually being serious I was
like I wasn't bothered about the show
not airing necessarily because it was
just a bit of fun but I was bothered
because I hadn't filmed any of my prom I
had no physical memory of it because
they filmed it and I just presume that
I'd have that to look back on so I have
nothing to look back on so that's what
happened with that show the show auntie
did go live it was in a two-part series
and one of my YouTube friends is in it
obviously Joel's in it so if you do want
to go see you I'm sure some piece of
comments we'll figure out what show it
was but yeah really really annoying and
that's basically what happened with that
there's me spilling the tea on that
situation and the last question I'm
gonna answer is are you upset that
you're 17 and you've never had a proper
relationship if you go back and change
something what would it be oh I thought
this was really interesting because yes
I'm 17 and I've never been in a proper
proper relationship obviously I'm coming
up to 18 and sometimes I do sit here and
I'm like should I be upset about it
because yeah I'd like spoken to people
but it's never gone any further than
okay that can be actually boyfriend and
girlfriend and a lot of my friends like
Amina been in a serious relationship or
they are in a relationship and it does
make you think twice it's like you strut
you try not to doubt yourself you try
not to think is there something wrong
with me
then I'm just like no like there's
nothing wrong with me like I just
haven't found the right person
and obviously I'm only 17 I don't think
I'm quite mature for my age but I am
only 17 and I'm very aware that I have
the rest of my life ahead of me and at
the moment I'd rather focus on a career
and getting myself where I want to be
but I'd be lying if I said the thought
hadn't been there like having someone to
share everything with because at the
moment I share everything with you guys
and my friends my best friends but I've
also sought like there's something
missing and I feel like yeah like I do
think there's something missing but I
just guessed the right person has it
come along for me to think okay like I
want you to be my boyfriend so that
you're I mean like so yeah like it can't
get a bit like what's wrong with me why
isn't this happened but then I
understand I'm only 17 and I'd rather
kind of live my life and get a really
good career ahead of me and then find
and settle down with somebody later on
in life so that's the end I won't do to
Q&amp;amp;A session I really hope you guys have
enjoyed it if you did please smash a
huge thumbs up as I said there's
questions I just can't answer right now
just cuz drama and everything like that
but yeah I hope you guys enjoyed if you
did it please smash a huge thumbs up
leave a comment down below with any more
questions that you want me to answer and
I'll just arts it in the comment
obviously this video is like 20 minutes
long as I'm filming this so I don't want
to bore you guys too much but thank you
so much for watching I really hope you
have enjoyed and I will see you on
Sunday at 10 a.m. of a brand new video
