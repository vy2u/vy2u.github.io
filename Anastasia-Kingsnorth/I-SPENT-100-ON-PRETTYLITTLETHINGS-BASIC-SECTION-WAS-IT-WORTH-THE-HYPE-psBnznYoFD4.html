today's video i'm back with another haul
but let's be real what am I not doing
horse today I'm gonna be doing another
one of those I've spent too much money
on a pretty little thing videos and
today i raided the basic section i've
never actually seen this done before and
i can't quite decide if it's a good idea
or not but I personally love like basic
clothes it is basic tops leggings
jackets trousers basically everything
like that I'm pretty little thing have a
really good basic section so I spent
about 80 pounds nearly 3.8 thousand 100
pounds on a ton of their basic selection
stuff and I'm just going to show you
what I bought I really enjoy this
because I feel like a lot of outfits at
nowadays on Instagram and on YouTube are
quite basic but they look amazing so
I've got very instagram and youtube
popular items here and most expensive
item which was a jacket with 20 pounds
and everything else is under 20 even I
got some trousers for 5 pounds also just
chucking it out there that if I sound a
bit different or I felt like I can't
talk as loud that would be because I
have a really bad cold and a sore throat
right now but as you are watching this I
will be in LA in Palm Springs at
Coachella so I'm having to pre film and
I'm not very well at the moment so
please try and excuse that but if you do
want to see more pretty little thing
cause and Coachella vlogs
hello Travel Channel and follow my
Instagram because I'll be posting loads
of photos showing you guys my trip out
there but further ado I'm going to get
straight on into the video so I hope you
guys enjoy if you do such a huge thumbs
up and own that let's just get started
the first thing that I picked up worth 5
pounds and these are some basic camera
Jersey leggings the color of them isn't
the color I thought this is more of a
brown tones nude I thought it's going to
be more of a pink tones nude
however I just don't really like the
color right now do you think it's really
really nice so I like these I mean
obviously let's get them out the
packaging this is a Tryon horse I will
be trying them on but they feel very
nice obviously they don't feel like
amazing quality but then they are in the
basic section so we can't expect you
know like
trying to think of something to say but
it just become but these are five pounds
that actually they look really nice of
quite excited to try these on actually
and they have them in a lot of colors
but I like the nude packs I don't
actually have any leggings this color
I've got like gray pink rose black I
thought you know what it's kind of a bit
different I've got the leggings on and
they feel so soft and I don't think we
get a VP oh I might don't hammer but I
don't in realise and the back of them
looks so nice like he's really really
flattering because they are so tight
fitting but then the front gives me such
a bad camel toe and because of the color
as well it's really not healthy not
going to actually don't want to put my
legs together because of how bad the
camel toe is however I love love the
color and I love how flattering they are
just not very flattering on the front
part her but I would recommend them not
on my legs are together now you could
say oh well but it doesn't like a camel
toe but I do really like them and I feel
like in a different color the camel toe
wouldn't be as obvious so I don't know
would recommend these for a fibre
I mean you can't complain for five
pounds and they are really good quality
and they feel so soft as well the length
is great I've just rolled them up but
the only thing I would say is that the
camel toe other than that these are
going to get a hit because I do actually
really like them and even if I won't
wear them out I will definitely wear
them around the house and stuff and I
wear them I go to like family places I
just probably won't wear them now the
next thing that I got is a charcoal blue
basic stretch scoop neck crop top Oh
move so it's really nice to me actually
I don't really remember what it looks
like exactly because all these tops do
that's pretty similar but they so is it
five pounds again and all you know what
that's actually really nice it's like a
charcoal II gray color which I really
like I prefer this gray to the gray that
I'm wearing as I feel like this one
looks more expensive
I literally just dist wear on top but
whatever this is really really nice I
feel like it's gonna be quite tight
fitting which is what I want and this is
again only five pounds so this is very
nice I see a lot of people wear these if
like the mazes and jogging bottoms and I
think it looks so nice there basically I
just went to hop on the trend I've got
on it the charcoal grey crop top and I
think this is so so nice it's so tight
fitting and it feels very very
supportive and I've still got the tag on
in the back but it looks really nice in
the back as well I really do
this actually is twisted isn't it you
know the fact that it is twisted at the
back but other than that I think this is
so nice I really like it it was like six
pounds and it's just forget really
pretty love the material
love how tight-fitting it is really
would recommend this there's honestly
not much that I need to say about this
because it is really really nice I feel
like you could go to the gym in this but
you could also go out and dress it up in
the load of necklaces and you could also
wear it in the day so I feel like it's a
really versatile top and honestly gonna
give this a hit like the basic section
so far is it doing me well I really
really like this the next thing that
I've got is a 2 pack of basic cream and
stone racerback
body suits ya body suits so this was at
12 pounds for 2 pack which I thought was
really good they basically workout six
pounds each and I've got like a creamy
color and then I've got a stone color
let's open these up all these are really
nice they're quite low-cut and then it
says like on the packaging erase the
back so they've got the cream one and
then we've got the nude one I really
like the nude colored one that's really
really nice I'm excited to try those on
actually I'm for 6 pounds I thought I'm
gonna get a lot of wear out of those
especially with laid necklaces and then
leggings and like a big thick jacket I
think that's gonna look so nice I've got
on the stone color bodysuit is it open
you try and both of them because they
are exactly the same but the stone one
is so pretty I love the color of this
again I love how tight-fitting it is it
is a bodysuit but I have actually just
like tucked it in because I'm not gonna
lie can't really be asked to do them all
up I feel like it's a lot of effort and
when you go to the toilet and stuff for
half the time I just tuck it in but this
is really really nice
it's got the racerback as well which I
really really like but two of these for
12 pounds I think that's amazing
again with the layered necklaces it
would look really really nice it was
very supportive around this area really
tight-fitting material is really soft
and it doesn't scrape on my skin or
anything honestly
again I'm gonna give this a hit like the
basic section is so so good and I'm
definitely gonna get all my clothes from
here from now on because I really like
it especially for the springtime because
I'm seeing all these are pretty much
short-sleeved and for the springtime I
feel like these are going to be perfect
the next thing that I've got is
charcoal gray basic cotton stretch scoop
neck top told you they're all pretty
similar oh okay oh my goodness a
bodysuit again I forgot it was a
bodysuit this is basically like the
other ones that I got that this is like
a gray version but the back does it come
up as high in the back and she goes
lower but this looks really really wide
like I don't know if it's just me but
actually doesn't quite wide but I feel
like it will fit okay and then we've got
the bodysuit bit the bottom and this one
doesn't look as low-cut as the others
which I quite like actually I think I
might prefer this one but maybe we'll
have to try and lon yeah this is really
really nice and this was let me get the
price this one always at 10 pounds and
the others were to 412 pounds so this
was a little bit more pricey so it
should be a bit better quality I've now
got on at the gray of body suit and
compared to the other ones I can see a
bit of a difference I feel like it is a
little bit better quality and I do feel
more supportive but then I don't know if
it's the colour because I thought like
if the others were in gray I'll be
saying the same thing and I just feel
like I prefer the grey to the other two
colours but either way I feel like
they're exactly the same like I've just
paid twelve or ten pounds for this one
whereas I paid 12 pounds for two
previously so I thought they are
actually exactly the same I'm not really
seeing the difference again it feels
really supported but just the back as
well it's not a Razorback it is a little
bit of a higher back but I think it's
really nice it's basically just it's
like the crop top just longer but yeah
this is definitely getting a hit from me
I haven't missed anything yet so
genuinely I'm loving the basic section
and I really like this top so I'll
definitely be wearing this again I've
got a couple saying this with everything
but necklaces jacket leggings jeans next
we've got a jacket and this is a bonus
but part of me this is a Annika black
oversized
waterfall belt basic jacket oh my god
these are sort of mouthfuls I actually
have this in nude already and I thought
you know what while I'm doing another
video I'm gonna buy a black one you
might have seen the new one on my
Instagram as I have posted a fair few
photos on it but just because it's such
an amazing jacket
and this is the one I was saying earlier
that it coffee 20 pounds
and it's so good people have such
expensive versions of these which cost
them like 80 90 pounds and places like a
sauce or just like Topshop places like
that the pretty little thing I've killed
it in the basic section with this
because it flows really nicely it's just
the perfect length I personally don't
wear mine with the belt with a pink word
in any way but I think I might keep this
on with the belt but it's really really
nice I can't wait to show you guys this
because this is definitely one of my
favorite items that I genuinely ever
bought for pretty little thing okay best
decision I've ever made getting this in
black how amazing does this look
especially with this table can you
imagine this outfit is black knee-high
boots I am obsessed with this at 420
pounds and you can like fold over these
bits say like drape in that little
waterfall way off your choice but for 20
pounds people pay so much more for
things like this and I love it it's so
long it's got the perfect length it's
got two pockets hundred-percent this is
getting a hit and I definitely recommend
it so all of the products are really
linked down below so make sure to go and
check that if you do want to they'll all
be linked down below but I love this so
much getting a hit the next thing I've
got is a basic camel roll net long
sleeve for you soon so apparently I
thought so many bunnies do today don't
really know what's going on finding this
one is the exact same color as the
leggings I'm actually kind of feeling it
yes--that's sorry so it's just a roll
neck bodysuit like I said it's
long-sleeved which I really like and
then yeah this is my new dish brown
color and let me just get the price
again for you guys this one that was at
12 pounds and I actually think that's
really good because the quality feels
nice I don't feel like it's going to be
see-through and I really like the color
of it like this is black jeans is going
to look so nice ignore the fact that
I've still got the brown leggings on
because it does look like a one-piece
but this hot is again really really nice
for 12 pounds I feel so cozy in it I
love the net because it's a really big
roll neck so you can kind of roll it
over or you can just kind of leave
which really like again with a nice
necklace and a nice jacket I thought
this would look so pretty and I feel
like this is just a statement piece that
everybody's just having their wardrobe
but hundred percent this is getting a
hit from me because this is so so comfy
and I genuinely love it the next thing
we've got is another top as you can see
I'm a bit top crazy this is a it's a
backhoe basic rib long sleeve crop tops
this one isn't a policy shop and this is
I could burn orange color although it's
called tobacco apparently and this is
basically just a crop top I really like
the color of it it just looks like a
very very low cut like really low cut I
didn't really want it to be this low cut
and the front doesn't look like it's
gonna be long enough for me I feel like
it's gonna be more of an under boob top
than an actual like you know crop top do
this one might be going back but that's
such a shame because I really like the
color in the texture of it obviously
we'll have to try it on and then I think
give you guys my full opinion but other
than that I mean my first assumption of
it is I actually really do like it
oh my gosh what is this the color is
amazing
this bit is so wide I literally feel
like I'm not even wearing a top like I
keep having to pull these up and these
are just gonna fall straight down one
this is not supported at all if this
came up my whole bra would be on show
and let alone what the back looks like
that's rising up quick it's such a shame
because I love the color of this and I
love like the ribbed pattern but actual
t-shirt style is just not for me and I
think this is the only thing at the
whole whole I'm probably gonna end up
sending back just because I don't think
I feel safe and supported in it which is
so sad because I love the color it's an
OK top and maybe I would wear it if I
was going on a night out where I was
going to a party but for daytime wear I
don't think I'd go with this I don't
know maybe I would keep it just need to
go to a party or something but the
daytime wear I think this is probably
gonna get a Miss and the last thing I
got isn't actually a crop top or this is
icon or more like a slogan t and this is
a basic a slogan do it for yourself t
and this weighs 10 pounds and a really
like is like a nude color and then in a
white embroidered writing it says do it
for you babe like got him and
him is crossed out I think this is so
cool this is so so me and this is gonna
look amazing like tucked into jeans or
type it into leggings or even as a dress
with boots because I got mine in at two
sizes up to what I usually am so it's
really really baggy so I can wear it
both ways but for 10 pounds I think this
is so nice and it's just like the
perfect nude color like I'm obsessed
with this color most people to like a
know it doesn't suit you and I'm like
well you know what I like the color so
that's what I'm gonna wear this is so
nice I feel like I might put it a little
bit to date maybe should have gone one
size up instead of two sizes up
nevertheless I can definitely wear it as
a dress and it's definitely got the legs
to wear it as a dress and this is so so
pretty I love the color of it I love the
logo that it says is a good nice cotton
material it's really flowy I'm getting
really repetitive with the words that I
use and that's just because I love
everything I'm actually obsessed with
this top I'm gonna wear this so much I
definitely recommend it for 10 pounds I
really like how the sleeves are really
oversized as well on me and like it's
really really baggy because that's what
I want I didn't want it to be tight
fitting so now is the end of this video
I really hope you guys have enjoyed I
