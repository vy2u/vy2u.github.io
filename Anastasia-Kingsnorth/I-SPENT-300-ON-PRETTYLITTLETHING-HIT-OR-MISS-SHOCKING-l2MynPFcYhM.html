see-through I thought I'd come wearing a
night dress and wonderful like wear
nipple was gonna pop up everyone welcome
back to my channel so for today's video
I'm so excited because I'm doing a video
but I feel like it's actually going to
be one of my favorite videos ever and
this is going to be I spent too much
money on pretty little thing hole
was it a hit or miss I have been seeing
these videos floating around YouTube and
loads of people are doing them for
different clothing websites but
personally for me my favorite clothing
website to order off of is pretty little
thing and I order I would say 70% of my
clothes from there so I said to myself
okay I wanted to buy it a new kind of
wardrobe for a while so I spent quite a
bit of money on pretty little thing I
think in total this comes to around 250
to 300 pounds I ordered a lot of things
I've tried to get one of each item and
I'm gonna be telling you whether it was
a hit or miss and if I'm gonna send it
back what I think of the quality
basically just a massive haul but is it
worth it if you do want to see me do
these for other websites then please do
let me know down below I'd love to do
one for maybe boohoo or misguided or
I've seen Rock cd14 fashion Dover which
looks really cool because I really
wanted to try some of their clothes so
just let me know down below but other
than that I really hope you enjoy and
I'm just gonna get straight on into the
video so let's go okay so the first
thing is that I can see next to me is a
top and this is basically well it's
called a black contrast long-sleeve crop
top and I think this was ten pounds he's
basically a black crop top with white
stripes down the sleeve I mean it looks
okay so maybe it will look okay on I
have now got on in the crop top and I
really like it it's really really nice
it's a bit more of a scuba material
whereas I thought it was going to be
cotton by I actually think by making it
in the scuba material it looks a bit
more expensive and you can really see
the white stripes there are a lot of
thicker than they appeared on the
website which I actually like because it
has quite a bit of contrast at the top
and then the top is high-neck again
which I like it's a little bit cropped
but overall I'm gonna give this a
hundred
I think I could really dress this up
with some really cool trousers and some
boots and maybe like a necklace or
something and for ten pounds I really
like this cropped I mean don't get me
wrong it's tight again like it is tight
and maybe I need to the size up but I
really do like it and I think it's a
really good quality material feels great
I mean the back looks good and I don't
feel like overexposed at all so yeah
overall I'm giving this a hit the next
thing I ordered is a big knitted
cardigan because I was recently down sat
and she had a cardigan and I was like oh
my gosh I miss wearing them like I
haven't worn one in so long
so I order myself one I mean it's quite
good it's grey looks very thick and I
thought I'd just wear it around the
house and it would be quite comfy so I
mean looks okay okay this is not what I
ordered I guarantee you I ordered a
long-sleeved cardigan and this could not
be more short-sleeved if it tried I
really like it and it annoyed me so much
because I think it looks so nice
obviously I'm gonna wear it around the
house anyway
but I wanted it to be long-sleeved I'm
so annoyed I swear I'm gonna check on
the website but didn't look it was
long-sleeved like I was so annoyed
he's only a little thing but I like my
arms to be covered and I just feel like
I look a bit like a back now I really
like it as well because the bottom of it
like flows so nicely but this is just
ruined my outfits basically now because
I really wanted to wear this but now the
sleeves just feel weird and like I can't
wear on my shoulder like that so I think
why I'm gonna have to give this a Miss
not because I don't love it but because
I wanted it to be long sleeves and it's
short sleeved and I'm not really feeling
that so I think this one is going to be
making its way back sorry and then took
it upon myself to get some leggings and
I got them in at two different colors
because I just really liked them and
these are some Harley stone ribs high
waisted leggings and as you can see they
are ribbed they look really nice I've
seen the floating around on Instagram
for a while and I really wanted them in
gray they didn't actually have them in
grey which I was really upset
because I really really wanted them so I
just got these hair in like stone which
hopefully will look okay on me and then
I also got this color which is called
rose and little bit of like a darker
pink / burgundy color I mean they look
quite good quality they were ten pounds
of hair so that's not too bad that's
kind of average legging prices hour days
and they don't look like they're going
to be to see-through so I mean I guess
we're gonna have to try them on but I
think they look quite good now I've got
the leggings on I have basically they're
a bit see-through so you can't really
see my head as much as I wanted you to
because I want you to see as much of the
leggings as possible but the leggings
are quite see-through and I feel as
though you can see my black pants I mean
are we gonna try the other colour on but
they're really nice leggings I love the
kind of ribbed effect I thought up with
this top it actually looks really really
nice and with the new boots I think it
will look good you haven't seen the
boots yet they're coming but I don't
know it's just a bit annoying I'm gonna
have to wear nude underwear with these
and possibly seeing this and or even
though I just wanted to wear these like
when I was cash and going around the
house and like trips and stuff I don't
know though I think they're really
pretty just the fact that you can see my
underwear has turned me off a bit but I
do like them and as you can see on my
legs they look nice oh my gosh any fell
10 pounds I like though I mean I'll give
the other color go and I'm like fer
those I've got the next pair on and
these feels so much better
I also got these in the size up so I
definitely need to get the size up but
this is such an unusual color don't you
think like it's not burgundy but it's
not pink it's like a mixture of them
both I really like it you guys can tell
me but I personally can't see one
underwear anymore which is obviously
what we want and I really like them
they're really really comfy I really
like the patterning of them I feel like
it's gonna look really nice even with
like outfits to parties over proper
dress things up with maybe a bralette
and like a third jacket I feel like I
can really dress these up and they're
super super comfy so I mean the nude
pair they're gonna get more of a Miss I
was to wear them but they're gonna get a
Miss just purely for the fact that you
could see my pants for this pair is
gonna get a hit because I like that
it's color I mean do you guys like the
color I don't know I'm kind of feeling
it
the next thing I've got is something
that I'm actually quite nervous for and
I don't know if this is going to look
correct at all but it is kind of like
eight of the black top and it's an under
boob top so it just shows your under
boob if that makes sense it says pretty
little thing across the top like as you
can see here and it's all black and is
short-sleeved I'm affair wearing long
sleeve stuff just because I feel more
comfortable in it
but I thought I'd venture out I'd guess
make sure sleeve I can never wear short
sleeve stuff and obviously the under
boob I mean this is gonna be interesting
if it looks nice that I think it will
look really nice but if it doesn't look
as much as I want it to be I feel like
this is gonna be one that possibly might
be getting sent back and this was either
10 pounds or 12 pounds I can't quite
remember by all check and everything's
gonna be linked down below anyways but
it was either 10 pounds or 12 pounds so
fingers crossed it's gonna be okay
straight away I've literally just put
the top on and for me this is a hundred
percent Oh miss I don't feel comfortable
in it at all I thought it was gonna look
a lot more flattering than it actually
does on me and that's why I'm not
actually gonna show what it looks like
what I feel like we're nipples are gonna
pop out like any time and it just
doesn't I don't know I just don't feel
comfortable in it no it's not for me
like you're gonna appreciate a nice top
but I've really liked the top of it here
and if this bit came down low then a
hundred percent and I would wear it
because I really do like this gappy bit
here yeah I think we're gonna give this
one a Miss yeah this was definitely a
Miss from me next thing I got is a
massive faux fur jacket now I wanted a
faux fur jacket for a long time I
thought they look very dressy when
you're going out at night and basically
I just live in my Bond jacket and wear
like Teddy coke from FINA so I just
wanted something a bit different that I
could look more put together in now
normally they're like sixty pounds and I
don't want to spend that much just
because I don't know how much juice I'm
going to get out of it so I got this one
and it was in the sale for 25 pounds so
they still have it when this video goes
up of course it will be linked down
below I actually had to get this in a
size 10 and normally I would probably
wear this in a size 6 or a size 8
I feel like it is gonna be quite
oversized to the point where I might
actually not be able to put my slit-like
arms in the sleeves it might look better
on my shoulders but you never know it
will just try it on and we'll see but it
does look very very soft at the 25 pound
I mean I would say how I tried it on
yeah but it looks really good
I've now got on the white jacket and
it's a lot more structure than I wanted
it to be I've got it on it doesn't feel
as big it's quite long but I actually
kind of like that so I know I actually
do kind of like it like I'm kind of
feeling the wire I'm gonna try it on my
shoulders and that might look better but
overall I actually think it looks a lot
dressy and I think it's gonna be really
good for what I want it for I feel like
I'm gonna give it a hit in some ways
because I like the color I like the
texture but I'm also going to give it a
mix because if there was a bit
structured wearing it like that I feel
like it looks so much better and just
having it like over your shoulders I
mean it still sticks out quite a bit in
the back and feels quite big but that is
because it's very structured but I
actually feel like that looks very nice
so maybe I'm giving it a hit when it's
like on my shoulders but amidst what I'm
wearing it obviously that I want to wear
it so I don't let's give this a hit or a
Miss overall but I think it's really
pretty still don't get me wrong I think
it's really nice and I would be a bit
annoyed at age 60 but I paid 25 so I
mean it's not as bad but the next thing
I've got is a pair of trousers and these
are some grey flared trousers and then
you just tie them at the waist these are
worth 20 pounds and they're under the
same section as my stripy ones that I
have and I love my stripy ones so I
think these are basically those just in
a different color and I thought these
are gonna be really nice to Winterfell
and maybe like a jumper tucked in or
something like that and some low top
trainers slightly it's going to be
really cool and they look a lot more
expensive like just looking in the
packet they look a lot more expensive so
hopefully need to go they're really good
on so I've now got on these grey
trousers and I have got a top on I've
got a body suit on but I really like
them I think they're really really nice
and they there were a lot more
flattering than I thought they were
gonna be I feel like pretty nothing I've
improved the waistband which I've been a
lot more comfortable in because I can
adjust it a lot more than I can in my
others
and I think the gray of these looks very
expensive it doesn't look cheap at all
it's kind of like a dark musky gray and
I just overall think they look really
pretty so these are maybe like a crop
top or something but overall I'm
definitely gonna give these ahead cuz
I'm feeling them I then picked up a
jumper and I wanted something that was
going to be very thin knit because
obviously we are coming into spring it's
gonna get warmer it's not necessarily
gonna get colder now so I don't wanna
like four count for some proper
thickness a jumpers so this one that was
15 pounds I got it in the size and
medium so I want it to be a bit
oversized on me and it's basically a
very thin it jump and it says by boy on
it just knitted in to the top left hand
corner and I think this looks super
super pretty and super comfy it looks as
though it's gonna be one of those
jumpers that are going to be very
slouchy which is exactly what I wanted
so I'm really excited to try this I mean
it looks really nice so I guess we'll
have to see what it looks like on I have
now got on the jumper and this is
definitely getting a hit for me I think
it's so nice it's just black it's
cropped it dangles obviously you can
tuck it into the trousers and it just
says bye boy bye I think this whole
outfit just looks really nice and it's
not too thick as well like I said it's a
very thin material so I'm not gonna get
too hot in it even though I'm quite hot
right now
but other than that it's a really nice
material I like this it doesn't look
cheap it feels very nice and if it was
very lightweight as well it does it feel
like it's dragging me down I love the
back of it as well so I personally think
that for me some pretty little thing
this is gonna be a hit I then it got
another pair of trousers and now these
look a bit cheaper quality that I
thought they were going to look they're
kind of like tight paper bag trousers
yeah they're called paper bag charles's
and they're lighter black tweets but I
thought it was gonna be more of a grey
and white stripe it's actually a yellow
and white stripe or it looks a lot more
yellow in the package so I don't know
how these are going to look make it
either look really cool or really bad
I'm not too sure yet but I really like
them so fingers crossed they are gonna
look nice I thought they'd look lighter
with some boots I've actually got and
maybe like a jumper tucked in and
I just love talking jumpers in but these
were again 15 pounds so I mean let's
give them a try
obviously you can't really see my face
that much so I'm really sorry but here
are the trousers I think they're really
pretty I've got a heel on so I can stand
a bit higher but they're very very tight
that's the only thing that I'm gonna say
a lot tighter than I thought they were
gonna be they're really nice as you can
see there it's like paper bag thing at
the top here
they're really nice around the back as
well and I don't know I just really like
the material of them I really like paid
by trousers they're very much me so they
fit nicely at the bottom as well but
overall I'm gonna give these a hit I
think even though I think I might have
to send them back and get the size up
because like I said is they are really
tight probably to the point too tight
but I like them you can tie them up
front here like obviously these two bits
are stuck on there constantly but then
you just kind of tie them at like this
and have them in a bow but I really like
the color of them now I looked at them
for a bit longer with like yellow and
the white and the black I think it's a
really cool look so overall these are
going to get a hit the next thing I got
is a dress and I'm really excited for
this because I wanted one of these for a
long time and obviously because I do go
to a third few places where I can get
dressed up I thought it would be nice to
have this just in case I want to wear it
you know so this was at 20 pounds and it
is a white shirt dress so this is
actually how it's come packaged there's
nothing really more I can show you and
try try it on
but it's literally just a shirt dress
like it's just a white button-up shirt
but I thought it wouldn't really cause
there be a belt round it into my black
knee-high boots and maybe one of the
white fur jackets gonna have too much
isn't it that's what that's way too much
like I could get proper dirty if I just
spilt a drink down myself oh my god
but this is 20 pounds so I mean maybe it
would look good I thought this is gonna
be a really like proper hit or mix like
it's gonna be either really nice or
really bad so I'm very undecided with
this because I've put it on and I love
how it looks at the top I love the arms
I think it looks really pretty but then
it's so long like so much longer than I
thought it was gonna be and it doesn't
really get like longer at the back and
shorter at the front and I don't know it
looks so
hey here I'm gonna move the camera down
and you'll see what I mean like I don't
know like it is above my knee and maybe
when I've got some like boobs on it will
look a lot better I think this is gonna
have to be a Miss just purely for the
fact that I feel like I'm wearing a
night dress and I wouldn't feel
comfortable going out in it I don't know
maybe when I've got my black boots all
and knee-high boots it might look a lot
better but at the moment in the way it
looks in this video right now I'm gonna
give this a Miss I then picked up a
necklace and I never wear jewelry so I'm
gonna try this on on top of something
that I've bought today but it is
basically a little like dragon pendant
necklace I don't know how well you can
see it I don't know how well it's
showing up but it was 4 pounds and
instead she just called gold dragon
pendant but I thought it was really
pretty
I prefer dainty jewelry and only it
really ever wear a necklace that my
friends need to walk me on my Pandora
bracelet so I never really wear jewelry
that much but I thought this is quite
pretty and it could add quite a lot more
to some plain tops that I wear so picked
up that here is what the necklace looks
like I think it looks really pretty like
I said I never wear jewelry so this is
kind of weird for me to have a necklace
on but I think it looks really pretty
and it's very dainty it's not too like
in your face so I think I'm gonna give
this a hit and I definitely think I'm
gonna get more drawing off of pretty
little thing I was gonna say my pretty
definitely think I'm gonna get more
jewelry off pretty little thing because
I think it's so gorgeous I then got
another jumper so this is called the
ultimate cropped sweater and I actually
have one of these in khaki it's super
comfy I love traveling in it so I
thought I'd get one in the color sand so
I'm pretty sure this is gonna be a big
hit especially with me because I love
stuff like this and they have like my
leggings as we cute little boots I could
really dress up so this was at 12 or 15
pounds or I think it was 15 pounds but
definitely worth the money know how many
even tried it on yet but it's so fuzzy
inside like you can see how fuzzy is
it's just so nice this might possibly be
my favorite thing out of this whole
whole so I've got the stone jumper on
and I love it this is the perfect size
one of my favorite colors it's like this
gray greeny stone color and I love it so
much it's at 15 pounds
was so well-spent and I feel like
together this creates such a laid-back
outfit that I'm just so in love it's so
like knitted and like soft inside that
it just makes me feel so cozy and so
warm weirdly considering it's cropped I
feel very very warm so yeah a hundred
percent I think this is getting a hit
from me I love this so I'm not gonna lie
you might order it in like three
different colors because you can proper
dress this up or dress this down and by
the way I really like it
and the last clothing item I got is
another jumper and this is just a long
sleeved black knitted jumper and you
can't actually see anywhere in the
package but down both arms it says
pretty little thing and like even though
that's the name of the shop I'm not
really bothered because I really like
this jumper and I thought having
something down the street was like a bit
better you know I don't know I just
really liked it this was 12 pounds and I
think it's gonna be really nice again
tucked into trousers it feels very soft
it's a light knit so it's not a thick
cable knit again so I'll be able to wear
this in more warmer weather as well
without a jacket but yeah so picks up
this fingers crossed it looks nice
because I don't really want to send this
back don't really like the look of it
this John Pro is a bit of me I love it
it's a very glowy material it doesn't
feel like it's like sticking to me or it
doesn't feel heavy the sleeves are a bit
tighter than I anticipated I thought
they were gonna be quite flowy but they
are very tight to my arm but you know
what I actually don't mind it says
pretty little thing up both sides and I
think they look pretty really pretty I
like it a lot I would definitely be
wearing this tucked into trousers or
tucked into jeans and even with these
leggings it's like a cash outfit I
really like it so 50 jobs going to get a
hit like I'm giving a lot of things a
hit I'm feeling good and finally we're
going in with my shoe box because I've
got a pair of boots and I saw so many
wearing these on Instagram and I was
like ok they're really cool can I pull
them off though and they basically look
like this they're gonna be - in a really
acquired taste but they're meant to be
gray but they look a bit green besides
that I think they're gonna look really
cool and I'm a size 4 so I've got them
in a size 4 but I think they're quite
nice like as you really like them so I
mean I'm trying them on with the
trousers but I don't think they're
actually that bad
really liking them I know you can't see
my face right now and that's because I
couldn't fit my whole outfit in the
camera frame so I'm very sorry about
that but I have got my boots on and I'm
not gonna lie
these are definitely a hit I really
really like them I think they're proper
funky especially with these trousers and
I don't feel like they're gonna hurt my
feet too much which is obviously a
really good thing because I don't want
to be wearing heels or boots this high
and being in a lot of pain because I
feel like they make the outfit quite a
bit but I really really like them
they're very nice material they feel
very flexible I can definitely feel
they're probably gonna hurt my feet for
the first use but just kind of walking
around like this they're very very comfy
and like I said that are really cool
again - these trousers so these from me
procedural thing are getting a hit so
that was the end of my video I really
hope you guys enjoyed seeing my hips and
my misses from a pretty little thing
like I said at the beginning if you do
want to see me do this with another
online shop then please do let me know
because always up for a bit of shopping
and then hauling it for you guys I love
you always so so much and I will see you
on a Wednesday at 6 p.m. for a brand new
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
