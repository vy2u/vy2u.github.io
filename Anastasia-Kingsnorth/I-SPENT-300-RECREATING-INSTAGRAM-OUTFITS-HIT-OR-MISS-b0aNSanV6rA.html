you have killed in the game if the tops
I wanna wear are in the wash then I'll
pull out this welcome back to my channel
or so for today's video I'm going to be
doing a kind of spin off of the video I
did a few weeks ago I spent three
hundred-pound pretty little thing about
a month ago now and I showed you guys if
it was a hit or miss whether I liked the
products that I got but today I thought
I would spend a little bit more money on
some clothes because I can never have
too many clothes and I spent around 250
to 300 pounds trying to recreate
Instagram outfits and just different
pieces of clothing that I've saw on
Instagram obviously when we on Instagram
we see loads of really cool outfits and
recall things but it's really not that
often that people put where they got
them from so I've done some research
I've gone on to urban outfitters that
pretty little thing misguided and a
sauce and I found some of the most
common Instagram items that you will see
I'll also put on screen like the
instagrams that I got inspired by etc
etc basically I'm just doing you guys
are clothing all today a very popular
clothing and I just really like you in
no way at all am I trying to brag I'm
genuinely just showing you what I bought
because I'm really happy with it and I
wanted to share it with you guys and
other than that I really hope you enjoy
and let's get started so I thought the
first shot we should go in with is it
misguided because I've got two things
from misguided to be honest I was gonna
do a complete misguided haul but I
actually think it's quite expensive for
what it is so I only got a few things
from misguided because you know I
couldn't really find that much that I
genuinely really liked the first thing I
got is so much jogging bottoms and I'm
gonna do this a try on haul so I'll show
you guys exactly what they look like on
but first thing I've got some shocking
motives and when I ordered them I'm
pretty sure I pressed nude but these are
very clearly brown I don't know like how
much I like the color I'm still very
undecided but they look okay quality I
think it just depends if they're the
right fit for me because I'm quite picky
with how my jogging bottoms fit now I've
got the doggy bottoms on I actually
really like them I feel like the colors
gonna grow on me a bit they're quite
flattering and I do
like the stripes down the side the only
thing I would say that the waistband is
very very very tight on me and like a
lot more tight than I thought and
they're quite long so I've actually
rolled them up but I wanted to be able
to roll them up so I'm not gonna lie
guys I am afraid feeling these these are
15 pounds and I definitely recommend a
squat if they're they're jumping bottoms
and they did these in a lot of colors as
well so these are definitely gonna get a
hit from me and the other thing I got
from this guide is you can't really see
at all in the packet but it is a kind of
silvery stone tie up top you put it on
and then it's hard to put the front into
a bow so you've got a little bit of like
your boobs out and then all your arms
are covered as well so it's quite a bit
more of a dressy top but I really like
it the only thing I'd have to say is I
thought it was Matt and I thought it was
like a cotton material but it's actually
kind of like a bit of a scuba material
and it's quite reflective so why do you
think that will make it look a bit more
expensive but this was only 12 pounds
and the doggy bottoms were 15 by the way
but there's only 12 pounds so I guess
we're just gonna have to see what it
looks like on now I've got on at the
entire top I love this so much I think
this is one of the ones that I was more
a bit like I don't know how this is
gonna look but I feel very supported it
doesn't feel like my boobs are gonna pop
out at all I can't wear a bra with it as
well which is really nice and I really
like the color obviously the bow doesn't
look as good as it did on the model but
I really really like this and this is
only 12 pounds and I thought this is
such a pretty top like even at the back
I feel so supported and I like how it
covers my arms I feel very cozy I'm a
hundred percent giving it a hit like I'm
not gonna lie
I say miss granite is expensive but
these two items I've gave hips to so
even though you are paying a little bit
more money I feel like it's actually
really worth it and the quality is
really good I know obviously I spit
envious about this material but I
actually think it makes it look more
expensive but I'm glad it's not caught
and I'm glad it is actually in this
material so I'm definitely giving this a
hip misguided babes you're killing it
the next shot we're gonna go in or with
its pretty little thing because that's
how you are pretty little thing is my
jam I just love this shop so much
everything so affordable then it's got
such cool clothes I just I just love it
the first thing we have pulled out is L
this is a crop top that I got and this
is basically cropped so oddly a crop top
and very well done but it's got one
sleeve
and it's ripped and then it's kind of
like flowy on the top I'd you know what
you call it but it's got like a rough
hem all around it you'll see when I try
it off that it was only ten pounds I've
seen a lot of people wear big crop tops
on Instagram and I thought this would be
quite a good alternative I don't know if
it's the exact but I think I can make
some really cool outfits with it I'm
gonna be completely honest this isn't
exactly what I thought it was gonna look
like I feel like I needed to go a size
down because they switch really baggy
and obviously like I would have a
different brand I probably wear like a
bralette or I'd wear a strapless bra so
just ignore that part but this bits very
baggy and around the back it's really
baggy as well like I really like the
style of tops I'm actually quite annoyed
so I thought this would look really cool
with like necklaces and stuff I felt
like in pictures looks really good
because people like hold it like here
and in real life is just kind of droops
a bit so really sorry but this is
actually gonna get a mix from me I'm
really not feeling this and I really
wanted to so I'm actually quite sad but
yeah this is definitely getting missed
from me next thing I got is another crop
top and as you can see it's very small
cuz we aren't going into spring and I
like to wear like smaller crop tops up
with big jackets and a lot of necklaces
I see a lot of people wearing that so
this is just a stone colored square neck
sleeveless crop top that was a mouthful
this was only six pounds and I think
that's so so good because the material
looks great obviously I haven't got it
out the packet yet but I think it looks
really good so obviously we will have to
try it on but I like it calm top number
two is on and again I really like this I
thought this is gonna be really nice at
the spring the only thing is you have to
be quite careful boobs I thought my bra
is gonna come out quite easily and it's
not like a sports bra crop top it's a
crop top that you need to wear a bra
with obviously this is not for the
weather right now I've bought this for
the weather in a few months but I really
really like it I think it's really cozy
I really like the material as well the
six pounds I felt I could kind of need
to going onto this in a few more colors
because there is some cute skirts and
like dressy Charles and stuff and
necklaces it's a really nice top I like
the color a lot of people were saying
this color washes me out and I do agree
I think it does sometimes but if I
hopefully gonna be the time in the
English Sun then fingers crossed it will
okay but I really like this and they
should definitely get in a hit for me so
a critical thing you bring it back I
like it the next thing I got is another
crop top now this I wouldn't say is
exactly a full-on crop top or at least I
don't think it will be it just says it's
a stone faux suede long-sleeved white
and it's got a kind of triangle neck and
it crops quite low but I thought this
would be really cute if some like
dressing your trousers and a load of
necklaces and this was only 8 or 10
pounds it really wasn't that expensive I
really like the color of it as well
again it's a bit more of a reflective
material on the website it definitely
looked a bit more cotton but I'm excited
to see what it looks like on because I
own the website I really liked it
I've got the third and final crop top on
and I'm gonna be honest I don't know I
just feel like it looks very wrinkly and
why just being weird or does it and I
feel like it's as well like too low-cut
like the others I feel safe in but this
I feel like if I pulled it down
everything would come out but I didn't
really like it like I don't think I'll
send it back but I don't think I'm gonna
give it like a full-on hit just because
I don't know how much dryer get out of
it I feel like it's gonna be one of
those tops that like if the tops that I
want to wear are in the wash then I'll
pull out this do you know what I mean
like you don't really wanna wear it but
like it's a backup I do like it
the material is like a suede material
I'm just really I'm very undecided I
don't really like this bit here if this
was like a full-on top that I could tuck
in I think I prefer I think it is
actually because it's a crop top and
it's a lot smaller than I thought
because I got this in two sizes up so it
would be longer but it wasn't really
longer so I don't know I'm gonna give
this like an in the middle it's not a
hit but it's also not miss hi there that
picked up another necklace and pretty
little thing as in my previous haul I've
got one which was like a dragon and it
was only four pounds and now I found
another one but it's on a bit of a
bigger chain and the third is actually
big and it's just basically like a gold
bird I really am getting into my jewelry
I never used to wear it I just I don't
know what it was about it I just never
used to wear jewelry no ring so bracelet
so nothing but now I'm really getting
into kind of my smaller
dainty your gold jewelry like
loads on it once by kind of just like
we're like one necklace I think that
looks really nice
this golden eagle was eight pounds which
I feel like was a bit more expensive
that's like double the price I pay for
the last ones but I do really like it so
I think it's quite good I've got the
necklace on and I think it's so so cute
especially with this jumper which you'll
see later in the hall I really like it I
can see why it's like eight pounds now
because basically the chain is a little
bit thicker and it kind of like spins
around like you know what the DNA that
they teach you in science like the
structure of the DNA that's what it
looks like but I think it's really nice
especially with this jumper and
especially with I don't know any
anything I really really like it that
ego is such a good quality as well so
this necklace even though it was eight
pounds is getting a hit and the last
thing I got from pretty little thing
it's probably the thing I'm most excited
about and this is basically a gray mah
cord set and you get jogging bottoms and
then an off the shoulders hot I wanted
this for so long but they never have my
size and finally they had my size in
stock so I've got this in a size 6
because I knew a size 8 would be too
baggy for me because I don't know if the
drunken bottoms are adjustable but I
think this is gonna look really good
there's a very similar set that
everybody gets from fashion Nova and I
really really like it it has like a hood
and stuff and I thought it was so cute
but everybody was like don't order off a
fashion / because if you want to send it
back then you get credit so I don't
really want to do that I'd rather just
order a very similar one and this was at
25 pounds so for a cold stare I don't
think it's actually that bad and I
thought you could really either dress
this up and actually we're like heeled
boots more like Nanak black Chelsea
boots like actual heeled boots or you
could dress it down and just wear
trainers and like a tracksuit hoodie I
think it's gonna be really cool and I'm
really excited to play around with the
styles of this I think we may have just
found the biggest hit in the video ever
I love this so much I was right when you
undo this like it's just one waistband
so you do have to tie it yourself that
you can't tighten it so I always get
your exact size as you can't tighten it
at all but alright really like this I've
got a brown - ignore my straps but I
really like the crop top of it I really
like the trousers they're really
flattering I'll show you guys the bottom
but they're really really comfy I've
rolled them up and I know I just love
the color of it the bottoms as you
see I just rolled up but they're super
super pretty I really like these I don't
this is such a good jute for the fashion
over one and I really do see a lot of
people on Instagram wearing these so I
was so happy that I finally got one and
you've got pockets you know like jogging
bottoms are the best things when they've
got pockets the misguiding ones didn't
have pockets
we're not gonna talk about that these
ones do have pockets so I think these
ones are winning the game so this is
getting a massive hit from me the next
shop I got things from is a sauce that I
actually love a sauce like I'm gonna be
honest I've only ever ordered from there
twice this being my second order I just
felt like it was quite expensive but
then when I went on it it actually
wasn't as bad as I thought and they've
got such a variety of things on there
that I feel like I've been greatly
missing out I only got two things from
here because there wasn't much I could
find but the first thing I got is a pair
of Annie - leggings now I don't know
about you but I see so many people wear
these and they really either dress them
up again or they dress them down I
thought like they're really cool piece
to have in your wardrobe because
obviously they are branded so they're
not just plain but I like the stripes
down them and they look really comfy
they're like a cotton e material which
is exactly what I wanted I'm really
excited to try these I've got mine in
the size 6 if you are wondering and
these were at 28 pounds I've now got on
the Annie - leggings and again I'm
pretty sure these are gonna get hit from
me I really really like them they're
really nice my basically has some
three-quarter length ones and I had to
send them back because they were
absolutely awful but because these are a
cotton material they actually stick and
there are really nice length as well I
really like the stripes up the side so
definitely these are gonna get a hair
obviously these are branded but I see a
lot of people wearing these and I
thought they were really really nice so
I know they're quite expensive for
leggings like 28 pounds that's quite a
lot for what they are but they're
amazing quality like I cannot even tell
you the quality of how nice these feel
and they're so you become fee super soft
so getting a hit from me the other thing
I got from a sauce is a jumper and I'm
actually so excited for this jump up
because I'm seeing at loads of people on
Instagram where these kind of like cream
knitted jumpers with a bit of a high
neck but it's not a roll neck and
they're like wearing them with jeans and
different like bottoms and stuff and a
never layering neck
says I looks so pretty and this was the
closest one I could find and I really
like the color of it it doesn't look a
cheap knitted material at all and the
neck looks pretty good from what you can
see so hopefully what I've tried it on I
really like it
I've got the young piranha which is from
a sauce and I really really like this
this is actually the hynek's that I
wanted it's not like proper high roll
neck if you know what I mean but it's
really nice and baggy it's really flowy
I think this is super super pretty the
quality is amazing and it's all what I
like about it it's a very thin knitted
jumper so I'll be able to wear this like
all throughout spring possibly without a
Cohen but I won't get cold so this is
like the perfect kind of jumper and I've
seen so many people wearing them and
this is pretty much like an exact copy
of what i've seen so hundred-percent
they just get in her hair I absolutely
love it so yes this is so good the final
shop I went to is Obon alpha toads and
I've bought these pieces quite recently
but I felt like I needed to include them
in this haul because I always get
questions on where they're from so these
are from Urban Outfitters so I actually
got a feeler teddy bear coat now I got
mine in the size small and I actually
regret that now because I wanted it to
be baggy but at the time I got it to
like fit me so I wish I got a medium or
large as this is very tight on me but I
do really like it it's so warm like I
say this is warmer than my puffer jacket
which is saying something and if this
was 75 pounds I believe but I think it's
really really nice it's got feel up
written on the back and then it's got a
feel apart on the side and I just fell
in love with this as soon as I saw all
right here is the feeler jacket I love
this coat so much I think it looks so so
pretty it looked really good as well
they'll kind of it over chilled down
outfit with this crop top and the
joggers and then obviously if I put my
sleeves and help oh my god it looks
really cute as well I really like it I
cannot even express to you how cozy this
is but I think it's really really nice I
like the size I like the fact the patch
on the arm you know like a bit Fila
overall I'm definitely giving this a
hair I think it's really good although I
just would have preferred a really baggy
size so I could have like rolled up the
sleeves and made it look really cute
because it is quite tight to me but
other than that it's getting here
because I really like this so over
killing it as per usual the other one I
got from over
it's like another teddy coat kind of
thing but it's more of a track suit
jacket and this is from the brand is
friends I don't know if that's how you
pronounce it I think it means something
a French like it literally means
something French but this is like a
black teddy bear kind of thing it's got
a hood which I like which the FINA one
doesn't have and this was 62 pounds and
I got this in a much more of an
oversized look so I think I got this in
a medium so it really does back down on
me so I much prefer it but you just zip
it up with the zip here not that I
probably wear a zipped up but it's
really really nice I love that a lot so
that's the other jacket I got from Urban
Outfitters and then here is the second
jacket this is the ayats fans one I
really like this again it's got the hood
so you look really cute and cozy and
again this is so warm like I've got the
cropped up on the port and I'm
absolutely boiling underneath this so
462 pounds and it's really oversized I
really like it and you can see like it
genuinely is so backing on me but that's
how I prefer my hoodies so this is
definitely like a whole new person
getting a hair I love this so much I
think Urban Outfitters that do the best
jacket especially if you're kind of
going for the vibe that you see
everybody kind of wear on Instagram I
really really like this I'm gonna give
this a massive thumbs up site Thanks
urban babes you have killed the game so
that is the end of this video I really
hope you guys have enjoyed if you do
remember to smash a huge thumbs up let
me know some other shops or some other
things that you want me to take
inspiration from so I can do another one
of these videos because not gonna lie I
feel like these are going to be my
favorite videos to film and I know you
guys love watching them let me know what
your favorite pieces were down below
that I hold to you guys and other than
that I love you all so much and I will
