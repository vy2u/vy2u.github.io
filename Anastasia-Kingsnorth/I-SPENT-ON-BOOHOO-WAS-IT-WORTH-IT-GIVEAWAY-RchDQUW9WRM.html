today's video I'm doing another one of
these and I love them so many but I'm
doing I spent too much money on boohoo
calm was it worth it I've done a lot of
these videos I've done one for pretty
little thing I've done I think I've done
some including misguided I've done some
including a sauce I've never done one
about boohoo and Sony people requested
it I thought you know what I haven't
ordered off that website in such a long
time I was like proper place in order
holy for you guys you guys are gonna
love it I'm gonna love the clothes let's
do it but I think the owners really
wanted to do another hole but this will
be the last hole for a while I promise I
just have an addiction to buying clothes
and I'm not even sorry about it also
before we start the video I just wanted
to talk to you guys about an amazing app
called 21 buttons that I've spoken about
twice in my videos before I personally
really love it I have a profile on there
myself and I use it all the time it's an
app where you can get inspired by other
people's looks and you can get direct
links to the item of clothing that is
tagged on their photo making it a lot
easier for you to shop and style your
looks you can also save your items in a
feature on the app called wardrobe and
then you can combine them together in
the combined feature kind of pairing
outfits together for you by them making
it easier for you to look but obviously
you don't have to use the app just to
upload your own outfit you can use it
for style inspiration which is what I do
a lot of the time I love just following
people just to look at their account for
inspiration because that's to be honest
where I get most of my outfit
inspiration from plus anyone can earn
money if somebody buys an item that's
tagged on your clothing is not just
influences anybody can earn money from
the app which is also amazing so like I
said my profile for it will be down
below if you recently just hit a hundred
thousand followers on there which is
insane thank you so much make sure to
follow me on there if you haven't
already because I do link every single
one of my Instagram photos outfits on
there which is really really cool so if
you want to shop my style head over to
my profile I'm also really excited
because I'm actually holding a giveaway

really give away part of this video I
hope you guys are excited and now I'm
going to do my guru haul because I've
got a big bag folks here and I'm excited
to get into them like I said I haven't
actually shopped on boo hoo for a very
very very long time I don't know why I
think it's just because I've found other
shops that I also like and then I just
kind of forgot to shop on butoh so I've
got a big bag of stuff here which I
haven't actually opened I'm gonna open
it now for you guys and fun fact I
actually ordered this before I went to
Coachella
so I actually can't exactly remember
what I ordered so this is definitely
going to be a hole where I don't really
know what I'm hauling although I do know
I've got quite a bit of stuff in here
and all this is really pretty
first thing I've got is a necklace and
this is obviously from boohoo and it is
a kind of like a pendant necklace it's
gold it says it's a Jody sov'reign and
we're gonna love words
Jody pendant skinny necklace and it's
gold that is literally what is called
honestly these guys were winning so much
money one button profile and down below
if you do want to go buy them let me
just grab this out this is oh my god
this is so nice it's just this really
nice gold pendant and then it's just a
circle and its got like a picture of is
that Jesus or is that Mary I can't quite
tell it's one of them and it's really
really nice it's just this gold pendant
necklace it's quite simple I love
necklace at the moment I never used to
wear jewelry like literally never used
to wear jewelry and now I can't get
enough of it so I picked up this I'm not
sure how much it was but I'll leave the
price in the description unless they
sent me
in order for with the prices on four
pounds that's so cheap if you bought
this from anywhere else probably like a
tenner not gonna live so this is only
four pounds and I love it
the next thing I've got looks like a
t-shirt to me and it says it's a petite
sassy slogan T in black so again I don't
exactly remember what this says on it
I'll actually get to do that's why I
says fatty it basically said sassy I
just got like the description of what
sassy means on it it's black I've got
wine in a medium so it's a little bit
bigger for me because I'm normally as
small and it says sassy is an adjective
and she got this and she's owning it I
really like that I want to say that was
ten pounds yeah no no it's 8 pounds 8
pounds
sissy shot was 8 pounds it's really nice
like I said it's really stretchy
actually the printing quality as well is
amazing I can't wait to try this on I
actually really like this top you know
what it's a basic slogan top I'm a
sucker for basic slogan tops if you go
to my wardrobe it's guarantee you half
my wardrobe has like writing on it like
this and this is just a really simple
kind of staple one that you always want
in your wardrobe
just in case you need a top that kind of
goes with everything
I love the fact that it's black and then
the writing is white I'm pretty sure
they might have done it as well in white
and the writing was black but it had a
different quote on it but I really liked
the sassy one cuz I was gonna say start
really cringey there but I decided not
to say it but I really like this it fits
me really nicely I've just tucked it
into this skirt just it kind of bags
over but materials really nice at the
printings really good quality but eight
pounds you definitely cannot complain so
100% this is getting a hit from me
boom whoever actually kind of killing it
I really need to drop on there more
often the next thing I've got is a
graphic front
vinyl miniskirt now if you follow my
Instagram which you definitely shouldn't
if you don't already you will know that
I don't really wear skirts like I rarely
wear dresses either by definitely don't
wear skirts but I remember seeing this
on the site and I was like I really like
to pull that off and I really like to
try and wear that so I decided to buy it
this skirt was 15 pounds and it's like
this white vinyl material is actually
quite short this is short that I sort of
and it's literally just got this black
like elastic straight down the front and
that's essentially it like that is the
whole skirt but I thought it was quite
nice I thought it was quite simple and I
really thought I could dress it up so
obviously we're gonna have to try it on
but I thought it was quite nice so maybe
it won't be as I saw that this might be
a mess because it does feel kind of
weird I just kind of smell a little bit
but sorry that my head is cut off but I
just wanted to do it so I could properly
show you the skirt so like I said I
never normally wear skirts like this is
something soft or ordinary for me and
you probably won't see me in a skirt for
a very long time why I actually really
like it like it's vinyl which is the
only thing I'm not sure if I like and
it's kind of like loose at the end it
doesn't go tight on me but then I really
like the style of it I like the fact
that it's got this black down the middle
I thought it that really asked to it
especially if I'm wearing a black top
these two kind of complement each other
and what I remember when I was buying
them I did think you know they look
quite good together
but I do really like it I just don't
know how often I would wear it out maybe
to a party I thought this is a bit more
of a party appropriate outfit or maybe
if it's just a really hot summer's day
but the only thing I'm not as keen on is
the material but then I do think if it
was in a cotton it would look cheap so
maybe this material does make it look a
bit more expensive but I'm just kind of
torn but I do really like here and I
think it's worth the money and it does
fit me really nicely as well like
especially around the waist it's not as
tight as like here as I want it to be it
does back down like I said but overall I
do really like it and I'm actually gonna
give it a hit the next thing I've got is
a petite Rachel checkered tapered
trousers right they've got some more
checkered charles's and these were 18
pounds actually this is one of the most
expensive things that's not actually
bought lets me just afford these out
here these are pretty nice actually
they're bit more than using dark brown
which I actually quite liked so thought
there'd be a lighter brown ball take my
pretty day as you do look could possibly
a little bit too big for me but they
look really nice I like the color
they've got a hint of red Brown kind of
a cocky green and a black so we're gonna
have to see what they look like on but I
really liked checkered tapered Cheryl's
I've got a pair from Birch cut and I
think they're really really nice so I
always get another pair so I don't
always wear the same pair these are the
trousers I actually think they're really
nice that they fit me really nice
they're actually a perfect fit together
I didn't really think they would be
they're quite baggy down here which I
didn't really want I thought they were
going to be really really tight but I'm
kind of feeling how they're baggy
because when I put them in the water you
should go a bit tighter but they don't
have any pocket which is the only thing
that does kind of annoy me everything
else I really like about them the
patterns really nice it shows up a bit
like weird on camera because it's quite
like a small checkered but I think it's
really nice it fits you perfectly around
the waist I like the little button on
them because my others don't actually
have that and they're actually like a
three-quarter length so they don't go
all the way down which again I really
like so actually I'm gonna give these
trousers a hit which I didn't think I
would do but I really like the color of
them I feel like in some ways if you
don't dress them right they could look a
bit weird and sheep but if you dress
them right they'll actually look really
nice so I've got these I really like
them you know what boohoo I'm gonna give
them a hit next thing I've got is a
blazer and I'm so excited for this it's
called the I knew check roached sleeve
blazer
I know how much was this then oh I like
that was the most expensive thing and
this was the most expensive thing this
was 30 pounds I was gonna say I was like
surely my blazer could have been 18
pounds of that one a bit of proper
bargain I've seen everybody get into the
style of Blazers and I'm like I need to
get on this trend everybody's just red
Blazers and I thought you know what Anna
go and treat yourself to one and
actually that's quite a nice one it's
just like the checkered when it's got
like the brunch sleeves like it says so
the seats won't go all the way down and
then it's just lying to fight this silky
type material inside and I thought this
would be quite nice for spring just to
kind of chuck over with jeans like a
black top maybe even this topper is that
too much colour I don't know we some
nectar says I thought that'd be really
nice so I'm excited to try that on
actually I don't really hope it looks
nice because I really wanted to get a
nice blazer I've got on it the Blazer
and I absolutely love this hands down I
said it's my favorite thing out of the
whole haul because I've always wanted a
blazer but I just can't find one that
fits me perfectly but this honestly does
it was 30 pounds I love the past in its
kind of grey black white and red which I
really like fact this leaves a wrench to
actually add to it like I really like
how that looks
it's the most perfect fit mine is a size
six and it's actually perfectly it's the
perfect length it's the perfect fit
around the sleeves and the back it also
looks really
with this top as well and I'll
definitely be getting a lot of wear out
there so boo-boo you absolutely smashed
it especially in the blazer section so
things it's gonna be getting a massive
hit from me and the last thing I've got
in here I don't actually remember what
this is it is a satin collared bodysuit
okay so the bodysuit
if you watch my three little thing
you'll see our words obsessive body
suits and you know what guys I've been
trying to get the sizing for the past
two minutes and it won't actually come
open so Oh got it
so this is just all that's really pretty
actually it's different to what I
thought though I thought it was gonna
have buttons like an actual button-up
shirt but actually doesn't it's more of
like a bodysuit that just kind of drapes
yeah I'm gonna have to try this on after
not really gonna get the full effect of
it but it is very different to what I
thought I saw I'm just gonna start off
by saying it Stephanie know of what I
thought on the website I was sure that
it had buttons and I could like but up
to how I want to maybe have like the top
one under if I was feeling posh we'd
have them all done up but it actually
isn't like that
it is a bodysuit like I already showed
you guys and the sleeves are really nice
I realized sleeves this bit if I wasn't
holding this right now it would be
popped open like it just comes open look
at that yeah fair enough I could like a
pair and I might do that with like a
safety pin or something but it's just no
you don't get my order and it's really
nice it's actually really nice that the
sleeves fit me really nicely I think the
back fits you really nicely too from
what I can see just this bit is way too
open like we're way to a good walk down
the street and everything would flash
like my whole chest would flash I think
we are gonna have to sadly give this one
amid such I really didn't want to do
because I've been looking for a really
nice fashion shirt for a long time and I
really really really thought this was
gonna be the one but it's not I'm sorry
I'm just not into the whole having
everything out look I know I want to
keep it classy just have like one button
undone but no no not this this doesn't
do that also somebody's cutting their
grass that's really nice on my phone
just went off of that so that is the end
of this video I really hope you guys
have enjoyed if you did smash a huge
