today's video I am gonna be doing a long
awaited spring article I've got
absolutely massive bag like a saying
every Primark haul and today I am going
to be showing you guys what I bought
I've been doing a load of things like I
spent such-and-such money on this
website is it worth it videos at the
moment and I saw what if you do wonder
Primark and I was like you know what
that's such a good idea like I didn't
think of doing one for Primark so I
thought I would head in there splurge a
little bit because I've got some sick
bits in at the moment and show you guys
what I bought so I really hope you guys
enjoy if you do remember to stash a
massive thumbs up and other than that
let's just get started so like I said
I've got the biggest prime up back here
ever and they've proper stuffed it in so
I'm just gonna pull the items out as I
see them or I've done this in two shops
and the first two things I show you
often the first shop and then the rest
is from the second shop which I did
yesterday so the first thing I got I've
actually worn in quite a few Instagram
posts at the moment and this is a long
line gray knitted cardigan so many
people asked where I got this from and
it's from Primark i link it's a very
very similar one from pretty little
thing on my Instagram stories and it's
on my Instagram highlights if you do
want to go buy that but this one is from
Primark it doesn't have any pockets
which is the only sad thing but it's
long ride it's really really pretty it's
a very like Marley gray so it doesn't
look cheap because it's got different
shades of grey in it I like I said it's
just got long sleeves if you watched my
pretty little thing video you know that
I said it didn't know one light ordered
didn't have long sleeves and I was so
upset because I like having my arms
covered in a cardigan but yeah this
one's really really pretty as you can
see and it looks really good on and as
though this was only 13 pounds which for
a cardigan that I know I'm gonna get a
lot of wear of because it's not super
super thick I know I'll be able to wear
it through the spring time that I think
13 pounds is a really good price for it
next jacket that I got is a bit more of
a dressier one and this one was actually
20 pounds and I haven't actually had the
chance to wear this yet
I've got it in a size 10 which is a size
up to
I usually get so it's a little bit more
oversized as I didn't want it to be so
fitted on me so it looks like this and I
don't really know how to describe the
material I guess it's like a suede
material and then it's lined inside with
this kind of like cottony materials and
it's basically just a long line of
blazer it's got these little pockets
here and it's kind of like a past early
pink stony color a lot of people are
like Annie you're really pale to wear
this color but it would look good when
I'm wearing like a black top but I just
chuck it over something like this
so I thought this would be a bit of a
staple piece to have in my wardrobe to
wear when I don't really have a jacket
that suits my outfit because this will
kind of go with everything
it's long-sleeved and it does droop
really nicely around the neckline and
yeah I just really really like this it's
not really like a broad and fitted it
more just like I said
droops so it doesn't really look like
you've got super super broad shoulders
because some jackets that I've got a
literally square but this one just
shaped your shoulders really nicely and
yeah for 20 pounds I thought this was a
really really nice fine I like it a lot
Primark I like up in their game with
like popular pieces that everybody wants
if that makes sense like I know a lot of
people want those and I'll prime a
kesakhian and they'll do so well the
next item in here I got is trousers and
I am obsessed with these these are like
ribbed qalaat and I actually have a pair
of these already from misguiding it's
but I love the finish on these they're a
bit more like vinyl shiny material and
they're quite reflective and as you can
see they're just like these ripped
trousers and then at the end they just
like for like clots and they're just so
so nice they're a really thin material
as well so they're gonna be really flowy
and really Airy in the spring whereas my
others are quite heavy looking whereas
these like I said are very very light I
got mine in a size 6 just in case you
wanted to know as they will stretch a
little bit but I also wanted them to be
very tight around my waist and then just
flow really nicely
I do think these are gonna be a little
bit cropped on me though I don't think
my legs are as short as this size so I'm
okay with the crop look though I think
they'll actually look better crop then
they will full length and I just thought
these were a really really nice item to
have in your wardrobe throughout the
spring time and obviously because
they're black you can pair them with
literally any color top you want you
could pair them with a slogan top a long
sleeve top a crop top a bralette like
literally everything you can wear these
wigs so I just thought that was a really
nice item the only thing I am a little
bit worried about is they might be a bit
see-through because as you can see but
they are a little bit see-through now
I'm looking at them but hopefully when
they're like double layered up you won't
be able to see them but I might get a
bit of a vpl in them which over have to
get over or just have to wear like
thinning it cuz or something I really
like these and I don't know if I said
how much these were but these were I
think they were 13 pounds though we just
double check they were indeed 13 pounds
I then got a t-shirt and this is four
pounds and I'm a sucker for my slogan
t-shirts like that's just my style I
love wearing t-shirts I have slogans on
them and I saw this one and it's in a
size 10 because again I went to get a
little bit oversized for me and it was
four pounds and it's just a bright top
and then it says not your honey on it I
thought this was so cool because I don't
really own that many red clothing items
I've got a red dress which I hold to you
guys a few weeks ago and that's
basically it like that's literally it
and I was like you know what I'm gonna
venture out with my colors a bit more
I'm not very bright I tend to stick to
my nude my black so my grays and I
ventured out to mustard but now I
thought you know what this is gonna be
really nice and for four pounds that's
such a bargain most slogan tops are
normally like 10 pounds on any website
you go so when I saw this for 4 panels
like yeah that has to go straight in my
basket it's really good material I think
it might shrink a little bit in the wash
because my prymaat t-shirts do tend to
shrink a little bit but that's okay
because I've got it a size bigger than
me so I would go a size up if you do
want it to be quite baggy but it's just
short-sleeved and I just really like it
the quality looks really nice as well
and I like the font on the t-shirt so
the four pounds I really don't think you
can go wrong with the t-shirt like this
the next thing I have in my bag is all
what this what arnis what is this this
is just a long-sleeved plain black top I
remember I was thinking yesterday I just
need something very plain that I can
just pair with really dressy trousers
because I've got a lot of pattern
trousers and I think pairing them with a
patent t-shirt is a bit too much so this
was only 2 pounds 50 and I've got mine
in a size 6
I feel like this is actually quite a big
like
no it looks is this it's a slouchy top
oh it's meant to get like a tight one oh
well I think this also look okay when I
tuck it in but it was only two pound
fifty and Primark is really good for
your like basic t-shirt so they also do
this in about 15 other colours like no
jokes they had every single color so
these are just really good they also
have them in pastel colors which I feel
like call it green cute in the
springtime so I got you back then I
bought a makeup bag and I really really
like this I've somehow lost or makeup
bags and I'm gonna be doing quite a bit
of travelling this year I'm going to
very exciting places I'm so excited to
tell you guys about so I decided to get
myself a new makeup bag and you can't
really actually see it but it's
basically white and then it's got these
little like daisies on it I thought this
was so pretty and it was five pounds and
I thought you know what this is big
enough to fit all of my makeup in and my
brushes because sometimes I have to pack
them separately and it's such a pain but
this is definitely gonna be big enough
to fit both of them and it's very very
roomy inside so the five pounds I
thought is really nice I wish they had
like another bag to go with it that I
could have used the toilet trees because
I feel like this one is meant to be used
for toiletries and the other ones meant
to be used to make up but this is just a
best size for me I should have also
picked up - tada - back I do realize
that now but for five pounds I thought
this is a really good find and I thought
it was just really pretty and I love the
flowers for spring you'll probably see
like a color theme coming along here
we've got black white and nude that's
pretty much the colour theme of today's
shop I then decided to buy a bikini
because like I said I'm gonna be going
quite a few places and I'm also going to
be starting going to swim in a bit more
so I thought you know what I'm gonna buy
a new bikini so I got this one here and
it's just like a nude triangle bikini I
don't know if you remember people used
to have like legit bikinis called
triangle and I always wanted one and I
just never got my hands on one and this
is like a really good copy of it so it's
just black and it's like this brownish
nude and then it just ties at the back
and ties around your neck with this and
this topper was only four pounds which
is so good because prop bikinis are
amazing I had a prime opportunity last
year adding here before actually when I
went to Florida and it was so good so
honestly if I absolutely love this and
the quality is great like hopefully I'm
not gonna have a nip slip but the
quality feels great I then decided to
get the matching of bottoms and these
were three pounds
again they're literally just nude with a
black lining they're really good quality
I'm really hoping I'm not gonna have a
slip but I've got them in my correct
size so I shouldn't do although these do
look really stretching they look really
nice too and yeah basically the seven
pounds this bikini cost me in total I
think that's such a good bargain
especially if you're going on like a
week's holiday and you want to get a few
bikinis you can literally get three
bikini so about 20 quid all right again
I've got myself some sandals I literally
don't own any like sandals or flip-flops
or anything like that I tend to just
stick to trainers so I thought this
would be a bit nicer if I'm going like
aware if I'm just going somewhere where
it's a bit warmer so I got these ones
and for some reason they just reminded
me a little bit of like Valentino shoes
if like the studs and stuff I just
really really liked them I'm a size four
just in case you wanted to know and
these were six pounds they're like nude
and then they just go around your ankle
and then just got like the golden studs
on it
I just thought these would be nice and
obviously prime up shoes don't last you
a lifetime but they do last you long
enough and yeah I just really like these
the soles feel really good on the match
and they don't feel like they're gonna
break and they've got this like gold
detailing around the edge so yeah for
six pounds I thought you could go wrong
with these and they had lots of
different styles with the studs on as
well if you're not too keen on this
style I then picked myself up a pair of
shorts I don't know why I bought these
and more just to kind of like sleepy and
I'm probably not going to go out in them
these are really good if you get really
hot in the middle of the night and
they're quite flattering as well when
you have them on but I just got away
like a navy kind of black shade and then
they've just got white lining and then
so the last accreted ways that you can a
pool title with these so I really really
like these and like I said they were
only two pounds fifty ijen picked up
another pair of shoes and I thought
these would just be good as a slip-on
shoes if I'm just like quickly going for
a run I was gonna say run I don't go for
runs if you're just going out the house
quickly and you just want to slip some
shoes on and these are these like grey
suede slip-on shoes they're only four
pounds and I know again they're not
gonna last me a lifetime but they're
gonna lastly long enough for what I need
them for and they're just lined with
this like really pretty stitch detailing
and the sole feels really good to be
fair and I used to wear these shoes all
the time so yeah I just got a pair of
these I really really like them they're
just
and I feel really nice actually I don't
know how they'll do in rainy weather the
fingers crossed
even though the weather in England at
the moment is very temperamental the
weather should kind of calm down and
warm up a bit so I should be okay but
yeah I've got these four four pounds
high then it got myself as soon as
sunglasses not that I needed anymore but
sunglasses in Primark are so cheap and
they have such pretty styles so I got
these ones and they're like Ray Ban
copies they were literally three pounds
and they're lined with gold and they've
just got the really thin and like side
there and I don't if I'm gonna be able
to put them on because of the tag but I
just thought they looked so so cool and
they were only three pounds so for three
pounds I thought that was a really good
bargain they also come with a little
case as well which you know it's always
handy it's always a nice and extra thing
for I'm up to chuck in I know I just
really like these so I've got this for
three pounds and these are literally Ray
Ban copies and what Ray Bans are like
100 quid like yes I'd love a pair but
bit expensive so we'll go with these and
the final thing I got is from at the
home section and I love this so much
it's like a ceramic marble tea light
holder it was three pounds and it's so
heavy like it's such good quality and
it's just got room for like three tea
lights if you keep up with my vlogs you
would know that I've recently been
redecorating my room and this is
literally like right up my street oh
this is gonna look so good on my shelf
the three pounds I thought that was
really good and I'm gonna get some like
pink or like pastel pink a tea lights to
go in here and pop that on my shelf and
it looks very very pretty so that is the
end of this video I really hope you guys
