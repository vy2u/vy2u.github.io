for today's video I am going to be doing
another one of those clothing at videos
today I'm going to be testing out pretty
little things a five pound address
section now before I get into this video
I don't want to claim ownership of this
idea I saw hello it's Amy do it and I
thought it was a really good idea I
really enjoyed her video so that is how
I got the inspiration for this and you
do want to go check her video out I will
leave the link in the description I have
known that pretty little sitting have
done this five pound dress section for
quite a long time and I just think it
looks really cool because I'm not
normally the type of person to wear a
load of dresses I tend to kind of try
and escape it quite quickly and say oh
no I'll just wear dressy trousers and a
top so this is a bit different for me
I've bought seven dresses to test out
for you all in different colors all in
different like shapes and different
things like that so I really hope you
guys enjoy if you do remember to slash a
massive thumbs up and own that let's
just get started
hey is my parcel I haven't actually
opened it yet so we need to rip into it
and basically I was going to complete
first impressions I haven't seen
anything in here yet let me pull them
all out and then all my gosh okay
the materials are very different to what
they did online the first one I've got
here is a black strappy black plus
bodycon dress now I've got the picture
of it up on my phone and it was five
pounds that all the dresses are going to
be in this video and it's kind of this
like swimsuit II material is it like
neoprene but it looks quite nice I mean
you can't really tell anything from here
so we are going to have to try it on I
have got the first dress on and the
thing is I really really like the
material of it but it doesn't sit right
on my boobs
why don't I drop my hand it just kind of
like I can't explain it I I'm looking
very but it just droops and I don't eat
well this is the smallest size so I
couldn't have gone any smaller with it
and I think it just doesn't suit my body
but other than that like I really like
the back of it
backless but the straps like all that
I've got no bra on with this because you
can't wear a bra with it but you
you just pull the straps up and put them
around you and for me that just doesn't
exactly suit my body but I really like
the bottom half of it and I think that
looks really really nice and open back
it's just pretty annoying that the top
half doesn't really suit me but other
than that like four five pounds if this
fitted me right this would be such a
beautiful dress the only thing I would
say with this dress is going sighs down
because that's what I've done but I
still feel like it's too big but I think
it's really pretty so I'm kind of like
I'm really the middle I really like it
I'm gonna give the dress a hit it just
doesn't fit me properly but I feel like
for a lot of people this would look
really nice next one I've got here is a
nude rift under bust detail bodycon
dress now from what I can remember only
this one is ripped which I wasn't aware
of but I do like rib dresses it's
basically a bit of an under boob so in
another one of these pretty little
things videos that I did I got like an
under boob crop top and this is
basically it but in a dress version so I
thought we would give this one a go and
it might be you know I might be a bit
better than the other one cuz I wasn't
too keen on that one but got this vase
at second dress I absolutely love I
think this is so so nice I feel so much
more supported than I did in the top and
the only thing I would say about this
dress is because of my skin tone I feel
like I would personally need a different
color just because I am so pale and this
is like really nude but other than that
for five pounds I will honestly wear
this I think this is so so nice this
bitch is obviously quite showy and
obviously it's a lot of under boob so I
wouldn't be wearing this out to like an
everyday place but for a party or for
quite a big event I think this is so
pretty the back is all covered up and I
don't know I just really really like
this I think it's super super nice I'm
definitely gonna get this in a few
colors and it's ripped and it just feels
really comfortable and for five pounds I
don't think you can go wrong 100% I
would wear this out so definitely this
from the 5-pound rest section is getting
a massive thumbs up from me the next one
I got is a rose ribbed scoop neck
bodycon dress so this is a really pretty
color it's kind of like past the Lee
rose pink and it's basically just like I
said a normal body con dress is again
ribbed it just got straps I think it's
quite low car
basically this would just be a really
nice dress to wear if I'm abroad and go
to the beach or like a spring or
summer's day but just a jacket I see a
lot of people where they divide their
the jackets and trainers and sunglasses
and they call them to dress them down or
you can really dress it up and wear it
with heels so it is quite a versatile
dress and again five pounds next up we
have got the rose ribbed dress and I
like everything about this apart from
the fact I feel like the rose color
looks a little bit cheap on me I feel
like in a different color this dress
would be so so pretty I feel very
supported and even though I don't have
my arms covered up and I usually do like
my arms covered up I feel really really
nice in it again from the back entry and
I've got a bit of a visible pant lines
but then you kind of get that in every
dress so you would have to wear a thong
with them but other than that I really
really like it it just kind of looks
like a long vest top so I feel like you
would really need to pair this with the
right outfit for it not to look like a
vest top other than that though I think
it's really really pretty and obviously
this is only 5 pounds so I'm not going
to complain 5 pounds with it is so good
again this is going to get a hit from me
the only thing I would change personally
for myself is the color but other than
that I really like this it's getting a
hit the next one I got is white and this
is a white CREP split side bando body
corner dress now I've got this because I
just wanted to test it out for you guys
I wasn't entirely massively keen on it
but I've seen a lot of people wearing
them so I thought it would be good to
put it to the test again it was 5 pounds
the only thing is I don't like the color
but I wanted to kind of try and get one
of every color so I could show you guys
the color range although if I was gonna
wear this then I probably would buy in a
different color okay so I've got the
white dress on and I can't really wear a
bra with it but my nipples show through
I think it's the color because if it was
black I don't think it would but I
wanted to get a white dress to show you
what one would look like but other than
that I think it's actually quite nice I
don't know if I would personally wear it
again you'd have to wear a thong because
their knickers I've got on you can see
and you get a very big VPO and if I turn
on I'm pretty sure you're gonna be able
see my knickers to sew on it's very
Caesar I feel like it's one of those
dresses that if you jumped into the
water and you would be absolutely
screwed I think it's a nice idea I'm
seeing a lot of people with these types
of dresses I just don't think this is
for me
so so far this is the dress that's going
to get a mix off of me although I think
it would look beautiful on some other
people but for me the color and the
style just isn't doing it let me know
what you think but it's just not doing
it for me the next one I got is another
black one and this is a black Bardot a
body corner dress so this is literally
just an off-the-shoulder
black body con dress and I feel like
this is a kind of a classic staple to
have in your wardrobe and it's something
quite basic that is really nice all
these dresses are fairly basic as you
will see but that's what you would
expect for five pounds and honestly five
pounds this is so good if you don't have
a lot of money but you've got an event
or a party or somewhere that you need to
be and I think it's really good value
for money so I've got this one I'm
excited to try it the material looks
nice and I think this is probably one of
my favorite next up is this dress and
immediately I have fallen in love with
this dress for five pounds this is such
good quality the material is like a
classic dress material that if you were
going to order a tight-fitting dress
this is the material it would come in it
looks really really nice it's really
fitted I love this part here I feel very
supported
it's very tight which I actually quite
like because it feels like it's not
going to move off of me I like this bit
I've really liked the black I'm glad I
got this in black over any other color
because I feel like this dress in black
looks quite classy and you could dress
it up with some necklaces and some boots
and it would look really really pretty
so kind percent this is getting a hit
from me a lot of dresses are getting hit
so I'm really impressed with this five
pound dress section the only thing is I
probably am gonna send this back and get
the size up because for me I feel like
it is a little bit too tight and I need
a bit more looser in order for me to
able to actually move properly then I
apparently I got another black one I
don't realize they've got so many black
ones but this is a crap split side banjo
body contrasted I order two okay no I
remember this out this is the Bardot one
again but it's like it's got a split
down the leg it's a bit more like dressy
and it's a short sleeve so I think this
one a green eyes again I thought this is
really good but if you're going on
holiday or basically in another
tree or if I'm going to a party but
again five pounds next up we've got a
very similar dress to the white one and
I actually think this is really really
pretty I really like it it's basically a
Bardot dress it doesn't have any sleeves
on it the only thing is this so it goes
up really high to the point you can see
quite a lot of my bum and I don't know
if I like it being that high maybe it's
because of the size that I got other
than that I think it's a really really
pretty dress obviously it's only five
pounds and if I was really like a jacket
with this then I definitely could get
away with it you just have to imagine
all of these addresses really dressed up
or dress down obviously I'm just trying
them on me looking super plain so
obviously when it's got something else
with it it would look really nice I am
actually gonna give this dress a hit
because I think I will wear this I just
need to be careful how I style it both
for five pounds the material is great I
like the black I feel supportive it
doesn't feel like it's gonna fall down
at all so for five pounds you cannot go
wrong with this and I'm gonna give it a
hit and the final dress that I'm going
to be putting it to the test is this red
Hynek cap sleeve bodycon dress now as
I've said in many videos before branch
just isn't my color but I wanted to show
you guys all the different color range
that's why I got this in red but
normally I just don't suit red or maybe
you will think I do
I don't know me and sab always have a
running joke like red to have color not
mine
I thought I'd try it anyway and I do
really like it it's quite more for four
more dresses got a few frills is quite
covered up so maybe I will like it maybe
it'll be one of my favorites I don't
know I know I said red was at my color
but I put this on and I've literally
fell in love hands down I think this is
my favorite dress so far because I feel
like it just looks really classy and
that's the type of look but I do try and
go for I like to look quite classy and
I've literally fallen in love with this
dress it's got a little bit of a high
neck it's got the frills on sleeves and
I just think for five pounds this looks
so much more expensive the material is
amazing I've just got my normal bra on
with it but obviously if I was gonna
actually go out with this I would wear
like a proper browse it my proper
knickers with it so I don't get a vpl
believe me I know I've had a visible
pattern and everything one of these
dresses but we're just gonna ignore that
I honestly think this dress look
amazing I really really like this hands
down this is getting to keep and hands
down I'm ordering this in those
different colors I really like red but I
don't know if it suits me let me know
the coins down below what you think but
I think it looks really really pretty
and I'm so happy with this so pretty
little thing is getting a massive hit
from me so that is the end of this video
I really hope you guys have enjoyed as
you can see for five pounds these
dresses are such good value and honestly
it just goes to show that you don't need
to spend so much money on a dress when
you can literally go to the pretty
little thing for five pumps section buy
one for a fiver
obviously not all the dresses are going
to suit me and they're not going to sue
everybody it's just your taste and it is
over a hundred and fifty dresses on
there to try out for five pounds which i
think is so good obviously I only try
seven so I'll link all the seven that I
bought down below and then you can also
go and check out all the other 150
dresses there is to choose from other
than that I really hope you guys have
enjoyed this video if you have members
