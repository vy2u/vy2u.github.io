today's video I'm bringing you this
makeup tutorial but it's not just a
normal makeup tutorial this is actually
a recreation of one of my first ever
makeup tutorials
two years ago in 2016 I avoided a first
impressions makeup tutorial and looking
back in it I was very much a newcomer
into makeup I didn't really know what I
was doing that much but I loved filming
makeup tutorials so today I thought it
would be really really fun to recreate
my old makeup tutorial and show you my
makeup then versus now and basically
just showing you my improvements of how
I managed to kind of make much skills a
bit better and just what I've learned
from youtube over two years I also try
to use the exact same products that I
used in that video to show that pros are
actually really good but it's also in
how you apply them and I feel like I've
applied them a bit better so they
actually look a bit better
I also use some products I didn't use in
the video because in my first
impressions tutorial I didn't use
contour I didn't fill in my eyebrows I
didn't use false eyelashes I didn't use
eyeliner so this is basically a bit of
an improvement on that tutorial but also
following it so you guys can see what I
used to look like I really hope you guys
enjoyed this video if you do remember to
smash a huge thumbs up and other than
that let's get into the video in the
original tutorial I actually decided to
do my rice first which I feel like was a
good decision back then but today I
don't feel like I should do my eyes
first anymore I just got a lot more
comfortable doing my face first we're
gonna skip into the video a little bit
and we're gonna start halfway through
this tutorial and then it go back to the
other half so for this we are using the
benefit Porefessional primer this used
to be my Holy Grail primer and I still
love it to this day to be honest I still
do pick this out of my jaw a lot at the
time but in the tutorial I use this
because back then oh my god I used to
wear this every day skin feels so smooth
in the original tutorial I use the Make
Up For Ever HD foundation now I haven't
really used this that much since the
tutorial and the tutorial was a very
very long time ago I think I've used it
like a few times on nights out I don't
really tend to wear it our nation that
much just gonna pop this on my face it's
a really nice color match for me
and
actually bought this when I was in Paris
again it's quite a thick foundation it's
not as thick as some of the other
foundations I have used but is quite
thick it's not quite the consistency
that I really love
it does look a good color match so let's
balance it into my skin and see what it
looks like in the original tutorial I
used to use a Real Techniques blender
and now I'm using a wet Beauty Blender
so one thing I'm really loving about
this if they cut match I feel like it's
a really good color match for me
it's very weird to think that this
tutorial that I done it was 2 years ago
when I was filming it like I remember at
the time thinking how proud I was of
myself because I'd done that tutorial
it's just crazy to think that that was
like over two years ago now there's the
foundation it's actually quite drying on
my skin which I'm not a massive fan on I
feel like I really need a Jewish
foundation and it has dried and gone a
bit flaky on my skin so that's the only
thing but I'm still gonna stick to you
and I think they actually said that in
my original tutorial but now I'm gonna
go in with concealer and I took the
collection lasting perfection which was
a classic still is a classic and always
will be I remember I literally lived by
this for I'm gonna go for like two three
years like I still live by it now I
still use it on a daily it's just the
best concealer ever and it's like four
pounds like collection comes through I
do like to put quite a lot of concealer
on because I actually feel like
concealer give me more coverage the
foundation and I do use this as well as
an eye primer because we like to kill
two birds with one stone here on this
channel and then again I'm just gonna
take my Beauty Blender and a blender
tool collection concealer just blend so
beautifully I'll never get over there
either my base all finished and now we
need to powder this face up a little bit
just before we add contour and brows
eccentric cetera indian video I use the
L'Oreal infallible powder but I don't
actually have that anymore so I'm just
gonna have to go with my Rimmel stay
matte but it's a drugstore powder so
shouldn't really make that much of a
difference it was a little bit cheaper
than the L'Oreal infallible I feel like
the evil of always about 7 pounds to buy
and if there was four but they'll
basically do the same thing for the
purpose of this video now in my original
tutorial I didn't actually fill in my
eyebrows because back then I never
filled in my eyebrows but this video is
I'm not trying to copy the exact
tutorial I'm using the same products but
I'm showing how I've hopefully develop
my skills a little bit more so I'm
actually gonna fill my eyebrows in and
I'm gonna need a few extra products that
I didn't actually know how to use back
then just to kind of show you the then
versus now or two years different in me
doing my makeup so I'm going to be using
it the freedom brow pomade I am loving
this at the moment I'm kind of
alternating between this and the Antonia
beverly hills dipbrow but at the moment
this is kind of winning for me because
it's a bit of a darker shade which I
feel like I suit more as my hair is
brown I'll fill my eyebrows in
off-camera and then we will come back
and we will go to eyes brows are on I
haven't done any of the rest of my base
makeup because we'll go back and do that
after now we're going to follow my eye
shadow tutorials so for this I use the
mani mu ax makeup geek eyeshadow palette
and this is so good and this is so
underestimated I don't even know if you
can buy this anymore if you can then I
will link it down below but I loved it
so much the colors are beautiful I felt
like this is where you're gonna really
see the makeup improvement in my eyes
because I love doing my shadow and I can
do it a little bit better now and I'm
gonna be adding eyeliner and eyelashes
and all the things like that so let's do
this I started off with this color here
and I blended this all along my crease
because I attempted to do a mini cut
crease but we're gonna report today the
colors in this palette are super super
pigmented by the way and I'm gonna be
really dragging that orange along
especially if we're gonna be doing a cut
crease I really want to complete like an
ombre effect so I'm gonna really pack
the color on to this super super bright
pigmented as you can see I've brought
that up really really high I'm gonna do
the exact same on the other eye as well
this is exactly what I did in the
tutorial I just didn't do it as
pigmented the oranges on my eyes and now
we're gonna go in with the burgundy
shade at the bottom here and we're gonna
pop this in the outer third and outer
corner and then move in a darker and
outer corner up even more I also did
actually use a seller tape in the video
to do like a really sharp line but I'm
going to do that with concealer now as
I've already done my foundation and it
will rip the foundation up so oh my god
to color so pigmented I forgot what it
was it's a really nice kind of berry
wine shade and it's a beautiful
beautiful color I'm
how much I love this one thing I don't
want to do is lose the effect of the
orange so I am only focusing this on the
outer third because I do want it to
create an ombre effect I'm carefully
just blending the two colors together so
it just doesn't blend too far out and
then I'm gonna go back in with the
orange shade just to brighten that up
again just so I know the orange is still
there well you're gonna take the darkest
shade in the palette which is this kind
of a warm chocolate brown with red
undertones and we're gonna pop this
right in the outer corner just to make
it super super smoky and again I want to
keep the ombre effect so I don't want to
mix it in with the red too much I'm
really focusing this color in the crease
to darken the look up now I've done that
and we've kind of got the desired ombre
effect now I need to drag the orange
down a little bit more because then we
are gonna do a cut crease and I'm gonna
do this with concealer so I need to make
it as obvious as it possible you
couldn't the shape of my eyes I have to
do the cut crease quite high up and the
way I like to do it is I grab Simek
concealer and then this kind of running
out same one a wife as well I just pop
it on at my lid just like this look up
and then it creates the line where I
need to do it and then I can just add a
little bit more look up again then I can
just take a flat head brush and I can
blend the concealer down and just start
to create my cut crease shape we're
gonna be doing half a cut crease today
so I'm not going to take it all the way
across as like I said I only want to do
it on the orange part it doesn't look
that bright at the moment because
obviously I need to add white eyeshadow
etc etc so at the moment this is just
the base layer and again we're just
gonna do that on this I look down and
it'll create the line that you need as
you can see we've got a very light cut
crease there but I do need to go in with
a bit more of the orange shade very very
carefully just above it just to make
sure that it's very dark it's very
prominent and it's still there because
there's no point doing a cut crease else
now I'm just gonna grab the white shade
in the palette and I'm gonna grab this
on a GWA brush and this is actually a
shimmery shade so it might not work as
well but I'm just going to pack it on to
really shape out the cut crease it works
really
really nicely actually the line will get
softer but I'm actually gonna line it
with glitter instead of putting glitter
all over my lid like I did in their
tutorial this is what it currently looks
like
and now I'm gonna take a summit
collection it go on crystals in the
video I actually took a makeup geek
glitter and I popped it all over my lid
but I feel like it's gonna look a lot
more effective if I line the cut crease
and then you'll be able to see it a bit
more so these are literally $1.99 from
any drugstore and I'm going to use
silver today because my goal one has
actually ran out and I'm basically just
going to line the cut crease line with
this cliff to halfway across just to
make it a lot more prominent and this is
like serious work but it's really hard
it's a little bit more visible because
my eyes don't really make a crease that
visible and now we're just gonna repeat
this on the other eye and then we'll go
in with eyeliner and lashes as you can
see we have now done the cut crease so
I'm gonna go off of camera I'm gonna do
some eyeliner which i didn't do in the
video and I'm gonna put some that lashes
on which I also didn't do in the video
because I'm kind of showing my
improvement then I'm gonna come back I'm
gonna carry on with the tutorial and
we're gonna finish off my face okay my
eyes are now done I really really like
them I'm very happy with them and I feel
like it's quite an improvement on my
previous tutorial we're gonna go in with
contour and this is something that again
I didn't actually do in the original
tutorial because back then I just
couldn't get the contour right I didn't
know how to do it I remember me and
amber would often have conversation
because amber could contour and I just
couldn't actually get a contour which is
a massive improvement I'm gonna be using
the Anastasia Beverly Hills contour kit
which is one of my ultimate faves it's
so beautiful it's so so natural as well
like it doesn't give you a too dark of a
color so it makes you like you've been
up a chimney and I like it it's a bit
more of a chocolatey Brown it's not like
her ashy Brown it's gonna repeat on the
other side I'm using a real techniques
contour cheek brush for this I've gone
through many different brushes that I've
used for contour but this is the one
that I'm really liking at the moment
because it gives me quite a lot of
precision and of course we need to
contour the forehead as well I don't
actually know how I didn't use the
contour I think it was just because back
then that was kind of like me getting
into makeup and now I've kind of gotten
into it I kind of know to a point
I'm not saying amazing but I kind of
know each what I'm doing now contour
just makes me look so much better
because I am so pale I feel like I
really need this to bring the color back
to my face and then what I like to do is
I like to go over my contour again with
a morphe 34 brush and just literally go
into the palette go over it just to make
sure it looks all blended and there's
enough color onto my face the blush I
use in the video was at the sleek rose
gold blush and this is an amazing dupe
for the NARS orgasm I love this so much
it's just like my third or fourth one I
used to use it that much and I used to
use it in every single tutorial so I'm
so excited to use this again because I
haven't used it in the longest time and
using it again now as many realize how
much I really like it for highlight we
are going to go in with the anastasia
beverly hills glow kit because in the
video i use the Abeka champagne pop
highlight but i use it in my recent
tutorial so you guys have seen me use
that recently and it's all smashed so I
thought I would use a palette that I
don't think I've ever used in a tutorial
before and this is super super pretty
to be honest gonna be honest haven't
used this in a very very long time and I
thought I just pop it back out with the
purpose of this video but I remember it
being quite pigmented especially the
yellow shade and I was right I feel like
highlighter really does bring the makeup
look together you feel I'm also using a
massive GW a fan brush for this and it's
so good it's really good in my cheeks
but I feel like for my nose I'm gonna
need a bit more precision so I'm just
gonna grab a smaller brush I'm gonna use
a more feet r39 brush just dab it in to
the yellowy highlight and just all pop
that on the end of my nose and then just
I'm also gonna take that a little bit in
my inner corner as for me and I look
isn't complete until I've got in a
corner highlight and a little bit of a
brow bone highlight and then again with
that precision brush I'm just gonna go
over the highlighter just to make sure
it's all there we're gonna grab a body
shop fan brush and just make sure that
it's all blended in there's no harsh
lines in this tutorial I use one of my
favorite lip products and I rarely ever
use anymore so we bring it back and I
use the color pop lipstick in the shade
right / now I used to
so you adore red lipsticks but I never
really wear them anymore I always stick
to nude so this is really exciting to me
to come back as use its lipstick again
insane that is my bottom lip done and as
you can see it's just such a beautiful
color the fact that this is a recreation
of my other makeup tutorial about how
much better it looks is crazy to me
because I uploaded that video in
November 2016 and now it's February 2018
and this is basically how much my makeup
has improved obviously I've done all the
editions but that's because I've learned
to use eyeliner now how to stick lashes
on how to contour I spit in my eyebrows
and I no means am I saying that my
makeup looks perfect now but I do know
that it is a massive improvement on what
it used to be I really hope you guys
have enjoyed watching this video let me
know what you think of kind of my makeup
free creation and I guess transformation
down below I would also love to see you
guys do this video because somebody
actually tweeted me to do it so if you
do want to recreate it
please go recreate it do one of your own
makeup tutorials and you've uploaded or
just anything like that and please tweet
