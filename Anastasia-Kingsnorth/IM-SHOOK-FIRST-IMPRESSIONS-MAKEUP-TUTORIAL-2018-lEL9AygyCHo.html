today's video I am going to be doing a
first impressions makeup tutorial on
this makeup looks like I'm wearing right
here as you can see I've gone for a very
purple lip and a very orange smokey I
don't know if the lip and the icon band
match but I feel like they might so
we're gonna risk it like I said this
makeup look is it made up of first
impression so a lot of new products here
that all of you guys have been asking it
for my opinions on and you've wanted me
to test out that's what I've done today
I really hope you enjoyed if you do
remember to smash a huge thumbs up and
other than that let's just get started
so as you can see I are looking a bit
bare face the only thing I put on my
face is eyebrows and that's because I
don't have a product that I haven't used
in a tutorial before for my eyebrows so
I filled the minute very lightly with
the freedom of brow pomade but once I've
done my foundation then I'll go back
over them I'm excited so let's get on
with primer so I've got the YSL primer
here and this is called the two she
claps blur primer and I can see it's got
a little bit of sparkle in it and it's
pink so I was lucky enough to receive
these in a PR package they sent me
install glow PR package on well it's got
a pumper so good and they sent me the
blue one the orange one and the pink one
and today I'm going to be trying at the
pink one so that's giving a little bit
of a pump until it starts to come out
which might not be for a while once it
comes out it comes out so I'm just gonna
use like two pumps I guess I mean I
don't know how much I'm gonna need and
then gonna pop this on my face just to
blend in I probably have a bit too much
on actually it claims this is a blurring
primer wow this feels insane on my skin
it feels like it has actually blurred at
my pores I got I only knew what it feels
like my face feels so smooth but then I
did kind of expect it from YSL because
it's such an expensive product Wow I'm
absolutely obsessive that I don't know
if it's got rid of any of my redness but
it definitely feels really really nice
for foundation we're going in with
another Whitesell product that they
kindly sent me and this is the why so -
she claps all-in-one a glowy foundation
and now I've never tried any products
from wires though apart from a lipstick
which again I haven't used in a long
time so I'm so excited to try this and
if I just pull the lid off is it like a
pull one ah it's another pump I like
that oh that didn't take a lot of
pumping I don't really know again how
much I'm gonna need I probably have just
got out way more than I'm gonna need
there but I'd rather going more than
less and then I'm just gonna pop this on
my face
mine is in the shade number two and
again they did send me this so I didn't
choose at my shade but I do feel like
this is gonna be the best shade for me
it's got a really nice smell to it just
in case you wanted to know that and I do
feel like this is gonna have really good
coverage because it's quite smooth it's
not runny but it's also not matte and
then just gonna grab my Beauty Blender
and we are gonna start blending this
into my skin now for boys so you would
think that this is gonna be really good
coverage I have no idea
I guess I'm just gonna have to see how
well it blends promote a real first
impression because I have cut out in a
few little spots it is covering it quite
well I'm not sure why that this claims
to be full coverage or whether it does
claim to just be like normal I don't
know what you call it it's okay I mean
I'm kind of liking it so far it's
blending really really nicely and really
smoothly so something that I love about
this foundation is it's really
moisturizing and it didn't go matte on
my face which then it's left me enough
time to blend it honestly like that is
so smooth like a hundred percent this is
really really good I would recommend
this also for put the rest of my makeup
on first to see but it looks really good
from a first impression or concealer we
are going in with a brand new drugstore
concealer and this is from ex1
cosmetics and this is called the delete
fluid concealer it claims to be a full
coverage concealer and a lot of people
are saying this is a dupe for the Mac
Studio Fix concealer and again like it
even looks like a dupe so I'm just gonna
pump this onto the back of my hand again
I'm not sure how much we're going to
need it's appearing quite thick which I
like this is shade number one so this is
the lightest of the bunch they do offer
a good shade range they sent me every
single shade available and I spoke about
it in my vlog so if you do want to watch
that that is like on my vlog channel but
other than that let's just blend I like
how it
a lot lighter than my foundation because
that means it will give me more coverage
and I can see it in a lot lighter let's
see how it's like for my under eyes
because I do get such bad bags I am just
gonna pop it on my eyelid as well as an
eye primer that is so so pretty I really
really like that I wasn't gonna have to
mattify it down but on a first glance
that has given me a lot of coverage it's
reading really easy I wouldn't go as far
as to say it's a Jeep of the Mack one I
would have to say it's kind of on the
same level of the collection lasting
perfection with consistency and I think
the coverage is really good as well
actually as I'm bouncing this in it just
feels really really smooth and yeah I
really like the finish on my face that
is all of the concealer blended in so
now I'm gonna set it down and I don't
have a different like first impressions
powder I'm just gonna be using my Rimmel
stay matte from the drugstore because
for this video I didn't want to go out
buy a brand new powder what I'm really
really settled with this one I'm just
gonna use that to mattify it down so I
don't look as oily I'm now just going to
go ahead and fix my eyebrows a little
bit as you can see they have gone quite
faint because of the foundation so I'm
gonna be using the freedom a brow pomade
which I used in a makeup tutorial not
that long ago and it's really really
good I'm now using this instead of my
Anastasia one at the moment because it's
such a good joke subject I always get
asked how I do my eyebrows and I
literally just use this eyebrow brush it
from Lily England it's just this tiny
little angled brush and I just brush my
eyebrows over this one takes more
shaping than the other one because it
doesn't really have as much of a shape
just like that and then probably I'm
gonna have to comb it out with concealer
already I don't know make that read off
in front I'm just gonna pop a little bit
of concealer and an eyebrow just so I
can carve it out a little bit and just
so it doesn't look as dark more defined
for contour I'm gonna go with something
that it's been in my drawer for a while
and I know that it's not exactly new new
but I haven't used it or I don't think
I've used it anyway and this is the
collection highlight a blush and a
bronze trio I really like collection
products the contour doesn't even look
used which makes you think I haven't
used it so this is going to be a first
impressions mine is in the
aid it's the shape space shape of
palette it doesn't say so we're gonna
have to go with the fact that there
might be one pallet so I'm just gonna
pop my morphe four brush yayyy for into
the contour that's a really really nice
color I don't want it to go gray so I'm
not gonna put too much on but that's a
really nice color that's a really faint
subtle contour which I really like I'm
gonna darken it up near my hairline a
bit and then just repeat the process on
the other side but I'm kind of feeling
that because my foundations really light
so I did need to add a lot of color back
to my face and then I am also going to
contour my temples and my forehead
because our to you before the purpose of
this video so no hair gets in my face
my hair is put back in a tight bun so
forehead looks a little bit extended
also sorry about the lighting it's gone
extremely dark outside so now I just
look extremely lit up so sorry if you
can see me too or detail I just realize
I don't have a blush I'm just gonna use
my normal everyday blush and just pop a
little bit on so this is the max that
Desert Rose blush this is super super
pretty and now we're gonna head in with
my eyes
so I've played around with this palette
off-camera and just not really created a
look with it I've just been just
watching them in my vlogs but this is
gonna be the first time that I create a
full-on big eye look with this palette
this is the Urban Decay Naked petit heat
palette and I think this is so so pretty
you get six different colors in it and
I'm just gonna create a kind of normal
smokey eye with the light ground and
orange and then we're going to add the
two shades heist and strike he's heist
however you like to say it and create a
bit more of a smoky dramatic look and I
thought this is gonna really complement
the lip color that I've chosen so I'm
gonna start off with the shade vibrates
and I'm just gonna pop this all along my
crease and this looks like a very very
neutral shade it doesn't really look oh
so it's gonna give anything to my eye
but I just want it there so that
eyeshadows blend easier all these shades
in this palette bar the first one and
map by the way which is another reason I
really really like this palette this
actually has given me a little bit of
color not too much now we're going to go
in it with the shade wild thing which is
this orange shade here and we're gonna
pop this all along my crease
I'm gonna be adding glitter not really
doing a cut crease but kind of at the
same time so if we're just gonna bring
this orange all the way along oh my gosh
it's so pigmented and just really really
smoke this out and blend it as much as I
possibly can but I'm feeling orange more
for the springtime that's really really
smoked out so I'm gonna do the exact
same on the other eye blend it all out
and blend it all along with the crease
just on the topic and I really want to
try to the Kat Von D tattoo liner I
really wish I had that to do first
impression to it because I want to try
so bad
as you can see I've now just got a ton
of orange eyeshadow on my face but I'm
really really liking how it looks so now
we're gonna go in it with the shade
heist or heat which is this at Brown
shade here and this is going to be the
first shade for the outer corner it
looks really really pigmented on this
brush so I'm hoping I haven't put too
much on this is kind of like a brick red
color it's very very similar to the
orange I'm just blending this in the
outer corner as you can see it's just
creating this darker outer edge smokey
Ness I'm then gonna go ahead and do the
exact same on the other eye I really
like that so now I'm gonna go in with a
shade strike and I really don't think
I'm gonna need much of this this looks
really really pigmented and just pop
this right in the outer corner and not
really move my brush that much this
compared to the other two shades is more
of not really a brick brown it's like an
actual brown more of a teddy bear Brown
so you really can see this compared to
the other two colors and then again I'm
just going to do the exact same on the
other eye focusing it in one area just
so it doesn't really move so it doesn't
bleed into the other colors this is what
we're currently working with so now I'm
going to go in with a little bit of
glitter or do two eyeliner first I don't
know I want to try out these at
collection glam crystals and this is the
liquid eye shadow so maybe I should do
this before eyeliner and then I would do
eyeliner so this is in the shade or at
one I think that's the shade anyway and
they actually sent me two of these but I
thought this Shane is gonna blend in
really nice wow that's amazing so I
don't really know how this is gonna work
it's a liquid eyeshadow so because I'm
just gonna pop it here cut halfway along
and just blend it really nicely but it
just kind of I don't know that is so
pretty and so so reflective and if you
could see it it's reflecting so nicely
in the light although I'm gonna have to
set it and to set it I'm gonna use my
highlighter brush because I feel like
this is gonna probably gonna be the best
brush for it so I don't even know who it
even meant to set this I think it's just
literally liquid eyeshadow so I'm just
gonna leave it on my eye like that I'm
just gonna add a little bit more the
only thing is when I put more on then
it's coming off if that makes sense I
think I'm just gonna put this layer on
then I'm just gonna leave it and then
I'm just gonna move on to the other
right just see if it kind of like dries
it works way better where there's all
you beam or eye shadow when it's on a
part of the eye that doesn't really have
anything on it tends not to sit as well
that is like insane oh that's so so
pretty like I really hope that's showing
up how pretty that actually is now I
need to prime it my eyelashes a little
bit before I do eyeliner and mascara on
as I will do that off camera so I'm
gonna be using the Maybelline total
temptation at mascara and I really like
the look of this I think I've tried it
once in a vlog I don't know but I really
don't remember doing it if I have them
sorry but I'm pretty sure this is gonna
be a first impression I don't need to
put much on though because I mean RF is
on so this isn't really true first
impression that you're more gonna be
able to see that eyelashes well that's
really pretty like I've literally just
put seven or eight strokes tops on and
what our T's are already standing up
that shows it's a good formula and a
good brush I'm now gonna go away and I'm
gonna put some eyeliner on I'm gonna put
some lashes on and then we can come back
and we can put some highlighter on it
some lipstick and a finished look off I
really like the eye look and I'm gonna
smoke it a little bit more underneath
when I come back I'm back with my lashes
on and my eyeliner on it so I'm wearing
GWA eyelashes I believe the exact style
with down below and a link to buy them
and then I'm wearing and my eye coat
super cat eyeliner because I don't have
first impressions for you guys I really
want to get the Kat Von D tattoo liner
but I just haven't got round to it yes
so I've got my eyelashes on that eye
look is coming together now I feel like
the glitter shadow looks so beautiful
that really made the look come together
now I need to take my I should've had it
again and I'm just gonna start blending
the colors underneath my eye just to
make the look come together and then I
can add a bottom lash mascara for a
first impression to look I honestly
think this is such a beautiful eyeshadow
look now I'm just going to go back in
with and white mascara and I'm gonna
blend that on at my bottom eyelashes
just to match my top eyelashes as these
ones I'm wearing are quite extravagant
and I thought they'd look really good
for today's look for highlight I have
got two different highlights but I don't
know which one to use I've got the Too
Faced a brand new unicorn highlight and
the Mac hyper-real glow I feel like I'm
gonna use this just because I'm really
excited to use this I've had it in my
drawer for a while now and I've just
been so excited so I'm gonna use my tart
brush which I'm loving at the moment
these are the glitter collection brushes
and I'm just going to tap it in all
three shades as this is the lightest
shade highlighter palette oh my god yes
Mac are killing it at the moment I'm
gonna use the lighter shade oh my god
the go the glow okay I'm gonna wear this
every day I'm literally gonna once every
day I feel like the brush I'm using it's
really helping because it's really
brushing it on like very easily very
nicely but oh my god let me put on the
end of my nose that completes the look
that on the end of my nose looks so so
pretty I cannot even get over that now
I'm gonna go in with lips so this is
that in my drawer for a while since I
bought it
I just haven't used it I've used the
other shades but I haven't used this
shade so this is the huda beauty liquid
matte lipstick in the shade and Medusa
and then I do have a lip gloss to put
over as this is a matte lipstick but a
feeling let's go for a gloss today so
I'm gonna pop this on this is a bit more
of a purpley lipstick which I quite like
and from what I could feel the formula
is really really nice it's quite so
I might need a few coats but the company
gloss over my not matter as much that
looks so so pretty I thought we've gone
for like awesome vibes this doesn't feel
like spring vibes at all maybe I'm gonna
have to do a spring makeup look because
this just wasn't the colors I was gonna
go for today I really like it though I
just don't know how I'm feeling about
the lip color with this eye look I don't
know if it's completely completely doing
it for me I'm gonna pop on top of some
of this brand new two-faced angel tears
transforming lip topper and it says
transforming so maybe there's a little
transform my lips whoa oh my gosh I
don't know if you guys can see this I'm
just gonna pop it in the center of my
lips as it has gone on the brush which I
didn't really want it to do that's so
pretty I'm just gonna pop that in the
middle just so it kind of gives the
holographic look but wow okay that
actually has helped so as you can see
this is the finished makeup look I hope
you guys like it it's very kind it so
many different to what I usually do but
I really like the eyes I'm very
impressed of the collection glitter the
naked beauty he will basically I'm
impressed in everything the only thing I
don't know if I do like is the color of
my lips but everything else especially
the highlighter and the lashes and I
don't know I'm just I'm really really
liking this look let me know what you
