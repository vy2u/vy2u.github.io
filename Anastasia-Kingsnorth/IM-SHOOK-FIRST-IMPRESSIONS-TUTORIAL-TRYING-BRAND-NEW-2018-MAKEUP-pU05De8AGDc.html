channel with so for today's video I am
going to be doing this first impressions
makeup tutorial and your girlish cook I
love this tutorial so much all the
products that I used I'm so impressed
with and I thought you guys are really
gonna love them first impressions
tutorials are some of my favorite to do
because I love giving my first
impression to you guys you really like
him what I think of makeup products and
today I've got a lot of brand new
products that a lot of people have been
asking my opinions on so I'm really
excited for you guys to see this I hope
you guys enjoy it if you do please smash
it a huge thumbs up and other than that
let's just get started
to begin at my makeup look I am gonna
start by using it the a brand new iconic
London prep set and it glow spray so you
can use this before your makeup and you
can use it after your makeup but I've
got another spray I want to use after so
I'm gonna use this one first and it says
applying this soothing mist before you
moisturize I'm used to finish makeup and
when you like shake it you kind of go
it's like I can't explain it they just
look so pretty so I haven't moisturize
my face yet but we're not gonna go
moisturize we're just gonna go with
primer today but I'm just gonna whoa
spray it on oh it's a very nice
apparently I'm meant to be like really
glowy so I mean yeah I mean I look quite
like wet but I look really glowy like
it's got a shimmer undertone to it I'm
liking it I guess I'll be able to tell
more about this product with what I've
actually done my makeup so we'll see how
a makeup blend went outside to the
foundation on for primer we're gonna go
in with the brand new one st. brand-new
is brand-new to me
Too Faced primed and peachy matte
cooling primer I picked this up in
Sephora when I was in LA a few weeks ago
and I've seen a lot of people talk about
it I really really wanted it I love the
packaging and I really like to face
primers in general the hangover primer
is really good so have high hopes for
this I like the packaging it's all pink
and then it's just got the golden lid
here and then it comes with a pump so I
haven't had to use this one come to pump
it a few times put it onto my finger and
then we'll just pop this on to my face
now it says this is mattifying which is
really good because I do tend to get
throughout the day this is blending
really nice actually if it was very
smooth it feels like it's covering my
pores I blend it it's quite like a hard
consistency like it blends but I feel
like you need to put quite a lot on if
you want it to feel really smooth it
feels kind of like rigid on my skin but
I could feel like it's working again
with this probe we're gonna have to see
how nicely my foundation bends on top of
it but it smells really nice it feels
really nice on my skin actually does it
feel sticky right it looks a bit my skin
looks primed and looks ready for makeup
I think we'll give that a thumbs up I
mean I can only give you my full opinion
what should our foundation but I mean I
want to face primers so for foundation
showing up we're gonna be going in with
another one that I picked up in LA and
this is the Maybelline New York instant
age rewind foundation now I follow this
is actually exclusive to America
although you might be able to buy it on
Amazon if you can I'll leave a link down
below but they do the concealer here and
I love the concealer and when I went
into Target they had the foundation and
I was looked at and I was like this is
so cool
I need this in my life so I'm gonna try
and open it it says turn the red collar
slowly left until product appears on it
behind to the plastic off yet probably
I've done this before the video guys
just bear with me two seconds maybe a
bit longer than two seconds yeah here we
go
so take the lid off and then it just
says turn the collar until the
foundation that comes up I'm going to
see it coming up it looks really orange
oh there we go just coming through now
it comes to on the sponge just like the
concealer does and I'm gonna have to
twist it up quite a lot cuz we're gonna
need quite a bit of foundation this is
also the lightest shade I just wanted to
tell you guys that as I do have a tan
but this show still it was quite orange
and my face isn't really tapped anymore
to be honest so I like the applicator
though this is really different I'm a
massive fan of the concealer so I do
actually have really high hopes for this
foundation I possibly did squeeze a bit
too much out on the sponge because
there's quite a lot in there but now I'm
gonna take my Beauty Blender and we're
just gonna have to learn this in to my
skin the first impression is it's very
orange toned and yellow toned which I
don't think I am but it is blended into
my skin really nicely
it's actually blending really really
easily it's gonna blend it down my neck
first but it's just kind of gliding on
my face I really wasn't expecting this
and I actually want to say it's a
perfect color match which you guys
probably gonna laugh at me because I
don't think I've ever said that I know
video that's blended really nicely all
around the edges of my face and it's
gone into like the nooks and crannies
around my nose really really easily
close up
it hasn't given me full full coverage
and I'm gonna need a lot of concealer to
cover my spots but it's given me a
smooth even base which is what
foundations meant to do and I only paid
eight dollars for this which is what
like six pounds so this is normal
drugstore foundation price if not a bit
cheaper and it's really good for
concealer I will be going in with the
Urban Decay all nighter concealer and
this is a brand new one I have actually
used this before but concealer was the
only thing I didn't have a dupe for not
a jeep sorry
a brand new one for so this is a new one
I've never actually tried this
particular one before so I'm just gonna
pop it underneath my eyes actually quite
a bit more not much it's coming out I
like to be really highlighted under my
eye it's and to be honest I do need to
add quite a bit more coverage on to my
spotty areas which at the moment aren't
too bad I've just kind of got the odd
spot where I think I'm just slept in my
makeup I knew this can see it would be
really good because the all-nighter
foundation is amazing
and yeah that's blended so nicely I did
have high expectations for it but it's
lived up I love this concealer I'd
actually say this is a dupe for the
Tarte shape tape concealer especially
the color range and it's just given me
the same coverage I just blended just as
nicely so yeah I've got as far as to say
this is a dupe for the tar shake tape
well this is on my face alright I'm just
going to quickly bake it and then we're
going to move on to eyebrows for
eyebrows I'm gonna be trying a brand new
product which I'm really excited for and
this is the L'Oreal paradise pomade
ecstatic collection and it's like a rose
gold e color kind of looks like the
benefit can brow packaging and you've
got a angled brush here and this is
really nice I actually got this
packaging as well it's like rose gold
this I think is the darkest shade I want
to say the darkest shade anyway but I'm
not sure where it oh this is 106
evany and we've got the little pot here
this might be a little bit dark I do
have all three shades or three of the
shades
they sent me but I thought on the other
- a bit - lights I'd rather go to dark
than to light so I'm just gonna use the
angled brush that it came with and I'm
just gonna dip this into the pomade
and I'm just gonna pop this on my brow
oh my gosh that literally glided on my
eyebrow one stroke and it looks like
that like I'm really impressed I feel
like it's possibly a little bit too dark
but it's nothing that we can't work with
and it should look okay when are the
rest of my makeup is finished but it
looks so pretty even the brush has given
me such good precision to do my eyebrow
with because it's got no product on it
and it's so thin so my eyes are really
dark but it's given me such good
precision that actually looks really
good I'm gonna have to carve it all out
with concealer it's a bit all messy but
I do that anyway so I'm gonna go away do
the other brow carve them out and then
we can talk about them but I really
really like it I think it looks really
good actually I blended all the powder
in and done my brows and honestly I
really really like them the pomade is
amazing and the only thing is I think I
should have used the shade underneath
the one I used I used to shade evany but
I think I should have gone for lighter
brown instead of a darker Brown that's
the only thing but the formula I love I
love the consistency of the product I
love how easily it went on my face the
next I'm gonna go in with a Tarte
product and whilst I was in Sephora as
well I picked up this favourites - glow
set and it's got in the lipstick and
it's got in a little mini palette that
has got a highlight and it's also got a
contour in so I'm gonna use the contour
it's called a pro - glow and I'm going
to use this shade here which is a shade
chisel so I'm gonna take my little brush
this is the e4 it's one of my favorite
contour brushes if not my actual
favorite I'm just gonna dab this thing
so I'm not sure how much I'm gonna need
and then I'm just gonna contour that's a
really nice color that really soft it's
not too harsh and that's blended really
really nicely as well into my skin it's
got really soft edges and that makes it
look really natural my skin is quite
fair compared to my neck at the moment
cuz my body dreams hand but my face
isn't so it's just hot we need you to
kind of darken up the look and then also
bring it up to my forehead as well
because you want to look really chiseled
really you know add some color back bit
pale and then I'm gonna do the exact
same on the other side I really wish I
pull this in a bigger palette now
because it's just such a pretty shade I
do have another
Halla it's called the Park Avenue
princess I just don't remember them
being this soft and this easy to blend I
like this palette as well because you
can take only travels because it's the
perfect size - it's not too big it's not
too small and it comes with a highlight
about to highlighters in it as well so
and then just again bring it up on my
forehead I wanna make sure it's really
really blended so I might blend it with
another brush as well and I have worn it
quite far down my forehead but first
impressions I really really like that I
think that Sally is a perfect amount of
color back to my face formulas great
packaging love so I want to sell they
give this a 10 out of 10 I really like
it next up we're gonna go in a for some
blush and I'm gonna be using the Mac X
Patrick Starr collection and this is
beautiful I'm obsessed with this
packaging so I'm just gonna open it up
it's gold inside and then I am going to
use my real techniques blush brush I'm
just gonna use a mixture of both of the
shades and we're just gonna pop this on
my cheeks whoa
that's our pigmented I'm actually gonna
have to use a different brush thing I'm
gonna go back in with this contour brush
and just soften out the edges because
that was really really pigmented it's
really good but you definitely do not
need much of the product which means it
will last you a very long time so I look
really really rosy now so we're gonna go
for the very rosy look today now I'm
gonna move on to eyes before I do the
rest of my face and I've got quite a few
I've got like three probes that I want
to use so I've got two different
palettes one of them is my Mac Pro
palette that I customized with these
eyeshadows in that I haven't actually
used yet and they look through like my
eyes on it and write my name on it which
is really cool and I've also got the
brand new Max queen supreme palette and
this has got a ton of glitter shades in
which I think are really really pretty
I actually didn't advert for the first
round of Mac girls had it didn't if you
guys saw it it was really really cool my
palette had come out there Bendis in I
looked really young in it because I did
it almost two years ago but these are
the new round of palettes I think
they're gorgeous this is completely
shimmers so I'm going to be using this
once I've used these colors to create
kind of the base look and then go in and
add a ton of shimmer my first of all
going to be taking lives grey brown
shade and this muted brown shade on a
real techniques blending brush I'm just
gonna
nests all throughout the crease this is
really pigmented so I don't need too
much key is just to make it really
really soft as we're gonna do a halo eye
today so I do need to bring it up quite
high so you can still see it I just took
a little bit more than will purple toned
nude you don't want to get it so it's
touching your eyebrow but you do want to
get it so it's heading up towards the
brow bone just so you can really see it
once you've done the halo eye once
that's all blended you can do the exact
same on the other eye I really like this
color I've never actually used it before
but it's blending really nicely they're
blending really nicely too they're quite
soft they're not leaving any harsh lines
and you can look like you could leave
perhaps on your eye like that and then
you could go back in and blend it
whereas some eye shadows you have to
blend it as soon as you put it on your
eye off so it kind of just sticks that's
the base color done I really like that
so now I'm going to take this purpley
shade here and I'm just gonna blend this
really really carefully in the outer
corner possibly bring it into the inner
corner as well but I'm not too sure yet
it looks really pigmented and yes it is
that it's such a nice color I am going
to cut the edge so it doesn't matter how
kind of messy that looks at the moment
but this is such a beautiful purple I
can't believe this I really want to make
that outer corner really dark so I'm
just gonna build that color up I might
go in and add a little bit in the inner
corner once I've done the other eye I'm
just not sure how it's gonna look and I
don't want to ruin it I didn't know
whether to go for a dark matte in a
corner or kind of add shimmer
again really nicely blended I'm really
really happy with these eye shadows I'm
definitely gonna be using them more
often and as though of this color it's
really buildable so you could dab your
brush in it and it wouldn't be like
overly pigmented and screaming in your
face but then you can rebuild it up and
if I like this looks very smoky and not
really spring-like at all but then you
know we don't follow along with the
seasons this is a little bit more like
copper toned so I don't know how well
this is going to match but I'm just
gonna pop this on my lid and I'm gonna
try and do a bit of a halo eye with this
I will be setting this with some of the
brand-new and matte eyeshadows but I
really like how this looks actually I
don't even think I'm gonna need a brush
I think this is literally such good
quality I'm just kind of gonna pop it
there doing carpet it kind of does its
which is really cool I've just pops out
in the middle of the eye and that looks
really really pretty it's made it a
little bit more pink tone so we are
gonna go in with some copper tones but
I'm gonna do that again on the other eye
I don't actually need a brush for it
because I just kind of does it itself
when you look up and the applicator is
so flat and so easily like blended it
just does it for you I love it something
that I'm really liking about this as
well is it's drawing exactly how it
looks on the eyelid which I thought it
would kind of smudge about a little bit
but it's drying
really really nicely so honestly they're
getting a thumbs-up to all this makeup
is just killing it I thought like I
haven't like not liked anything yeah I
really really like this and I really
need to stop sticking to the same makeup
every day because that's what I tend to
do I have a makeup bag put all the
makeup in it and choose the same stuff
every day but I'm definitely gonna
switch it up because I'm obsessed with
some of this makeup that I've been using
I've now got a bit of a bigger Real
Techniques brush and I'm going to use I
don't know what color to use I've got
all these shades here but I think I'm
gonna go for like her coppery shade cuz
I thought like copper might not really
good the shimmervale has made that color
pop so much this is going to look
amazing I'm going to use a bit more of a
precise brush as it has kind of gone
above the line which I didn't really
want it to do but it has done so I think
we're gonna have to kind of forget the
idea of a halo and just kind of glitter
in the middle I just can't get over how
much the shimmer valve has made this
color pop because this is such a
beautiful gold color and it's just
popping so much more because of the
color underneath I felt like I need a
really bright white shade in the inner
corner so I think I'm just gonna quickly
use a shade from my violet Voss palette
just pop that in the inner corner just
to make it pop a bit more and then we
can move on to mascara before we go on
to lashes I am just gonna quickly put on
a so that mascara so I've got the brand
new at L'Oreal paradise ecstatic mascara
just like the brown one all the
packaging is really nice it's like a
bronze rose gold lid let's have a look
at the brush brush looks really good
let's see what it looks like on my
lashes I have quite long eyelashes but
they tend to clump together really
easily
first impression is separated them out
quite nice it's very black I don't think
it would give them a lot of length but I
feel like it's gonna make them
really black and really separated which
I think will it really nice and
eyelashes it's a very lightweight
mascara it doesn't clump your eyelashes
at all which i think is really nice is
when you've got really clumpy eyelashes
just nice but this feels very
lightweight like I can't even feel
anything on my eyelashes my eyelashes
feel very natural and really fluttery
and I really like that look so I'm just
gonna quickly pop some eyelashes on top
I've got the gwa luxe still affect
lashes and they look like this I don't
know if they have a name or anything but
they're these ones you can pick them up
in a Primark they're amazing so I'm
gonna pop some of these on learn that I
have shadow just underneath my eye and
then we can move on to the rest of my
face but I really really like that
mascara I just want to put lashes on
because we're going for a full glam look
today all my eyes are finished now and I
am obsessed with this eye look I think
it's beautiful I don't think it looks
like too much or it looks not natural
but like natural glam it's not like over
the top there's only three colors I just
blended it under my eyes I decided not
to go for eyeliner as I feel like
sometimes I know they can actually shut
up my eye a little bit so although you
know what we're gonna go with no
eyeliner day today just stick the lashes
on and I'm feeling it so for highlight
which we're gonna do now I've got two
that I actually want to use so this one
isn't really a highlight it's more like
a blush but I'm gonna use it as a
highlight this is the brand new benefit
Gold Rush and I've also got a brand new
Mac highlighter and this is in the shade
whisper of guilt and I think this looks
really really pretty so I'm gonna try
this shade first and then we're gonna
pop on the gold rush on top now this is
a very gold tone then I don't usually go
for gold toned highlighters I tend to go
for white toned
on a first impression that's not like
blinding and it's not like pure gold
either so actually I thought this might
be okay with my skin I'm just using a
small tart brush to apply this so I can
be quite careful with where I put it I
thought it was gonna be really dark gold
and it really wasn't gonna suit well
with my skin but it's not at all it's
more like a light flush of silverish I'm
also gonna go ahead and put some on my
nose as that's my favorite ever place to
put a highlight being once you've got
nose highlight all the makeup comes
together and I just love it I'm now
gonna go on top with a little bit of
benefit to Gold Rush because how
beautiful is that
it's meant to be a blush but I feel like
it's gonna
really pretty on top of my cheekbones
and on my nose that looks really really
pretty it looks quite natural
highlighter which I wasn't expecting I
was expecting it to be very blinding but
I prefer it's been actual actually so a
mixture of these two together looks
really really pretty I'm especially
impressed with this I don't know if
these are like brand new out completely
or if they're just a new addition to an
already range of highlighters but these
are amazing and if these are out go and
get them if they're not I definitely
think you should when they come out I
really like it now we're going to be one
two lips so I'm going to be using one of
the new hottest lip paints and mine is
in the shade rosy and I think this is
matte if not it's fine I've also got one
of the brand new Urban Decay high five
shine lip glosses to pop on top because
these two are very similar colors so
we're gonna start with this one I'm glad
for going over it because this is way
too nude for the eye look whereas I
think that colors gonna match the eye
look perfectly I really like this kind
of don't get me wrong but I feel like
it's really brown whereas I was
expecting it to be more like pinky tone
but it's definitely more Brown toned no
word of a lie I've actually lost my lip
gloss I haven't found it this is the lip
gloss we're gonna use this is in the
shade backtalk and I think this is so
pretty it definitely matches that I look
more than the color that I've got on
dust so this is a high five shine lip
gloss so I'm expecting this to be really
glossy these smell like pure mint they
actually smell like after right so if
you like hard dirt you're gonna love
this
the fact that these are minty fresh
makes me like them so much more because
if you kind of like breath smells a
little bit and you need to top up your
lipstick kind of kill two birds with one
stone I really really like this actually
the color looks really pretty over the
matte lip this is the finish that make
up look - my first impressions tutorial
I'm really thoroughly impressed by all
the pros that I used here I had high
hopes but I always thought like there's
gonna be products that I don't really
like but I really really like all of
them so thank you so much for watching I
really hope you guys have enjoyed if you
did please smash a huge thumbs up and
other than that I love you always so
much and I will see you on Wednesday at
10 a.m. for a brand new video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
