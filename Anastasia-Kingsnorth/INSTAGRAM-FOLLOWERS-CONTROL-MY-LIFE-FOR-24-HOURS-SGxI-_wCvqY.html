today's video I'm doing such an exciting
one I thought like I say that all the
time but it actually is really exciting
today I'm going to be doing an Instagram
followers control my life long story
short if you haven't seen one of these
videos before Instagram have this
section on their story where you can do
a poll so you know what I'm gonna ask
you guys questions throughout the day
and if you guys are gonna get to decide
what I do where I go to eat what makeup
I wear whether I do something or not so
basically my Instagram followers
controlled my life for a day I've seen a
few of these videos go around on YouTube
before so honestly I'm not taking this
idea because a lot of people have done
it and I thought it was such a good idea
and I also ended up temporarily dyeing
my hair for the day it did wash out it
was only a temporary one but it looks
pretty cool so I really hope you guys
enjoy if you do please smash it huge
thumbs up this is definitely one of my
favorite videos I've ever done and if
you do want to be involved in other
Instagram videos and make sure to head
over to my Instagram as we get in it
super close to 400,000 followers over
there but other than that I really hope
you guys enjoy and let's get into the
video question number one starting off
this video I said what should I have for
breakfast now I really really wanted
toast
but you guys have chosen cereal at the
moment it's a 52% to 48 percent split so
it might overtake but I've only left it
up for five minutes so we're gonna go
downstairs and I'm gonna get some cereal
we're already starting off this video
not even wanting what I want so I have
no idea how this day is gonna go
Atika talking about tutorial yeah oh
yeah
it is now makeup time and of course you
guys are gonna get to choose some of my
makeup so I've got my makeup back here
and I'm gonna be asking you on my
Instagram polls what makeup you want me
to use obviously I'm not gonna be able
to pick every single one because my
ancestry will be spammed with what
foundation to show you is what can see
the Salar use so I'm just going to
choose a few different items I'm really
feeling like to wear just like a nude
lip today but I'm gonna give you guys
the option of wearing a bit of like a
darker color I felt like you guys are
gonna choose the darker color just
because you'd like to choose a difficult
option no in a bad way but I feel like
everybody's gonna click onto the video
that I'm filming kind of figure out that
they want to make me look as weird as
possible throughout the day I'm gonna go
ask on Instagram now what products
artist used and then I'm gonna use the
products that you guys want me to the
results of the foundation are in you
guys decided so I'm going to use the
L'Oreal True Match which I'm actually
quite surprised about I thought you guys
might choose the Maybelline but it's
fifty eight forty two percent split so
this is the foundation that I'm gonna be
using today and which I'm even more
shocked about you guys have decided that
I'm gonna go for nude and it's 82
percent for nude 18 percent for red so
this is that lip kind of we're going to
be using I really didn't expect that but
I'm happy with it believe me I have just
finished my makeup I use the lip color
and the foundation that you guys wanted
me to use and now the results have come
in a four might've fourth question of
the day which was pick a color and I
didn't say what the color was going to
be for I literally just said pick a
color so I chose between grey and lilac
and I'm actually going to add grey all I
look to my hair it's just literally
gonna be like the temperate probably
last a few days I thought that'd be
really cool for this video and I really
wanted to try it anyway so I've got a
little grey one I've got a little purple
one and you guys have actually chosen
grey which I thought you worked on like
maybe everybody gonna choose grey but I
really wanted to use the line look but
we're gonna use grey I'm gonna add gray
to the ends of my hair I mean it might
not look great you might not look good
at all but let's try it anyway this is
an on add or not spawn but these are the
two that I'm gonna be one these are two
I was going to use but I'm actually
gonna be using this one it's the new
hair makeup from L'Oreal and I really
wanted to give it a try so I just
thought I'd try it in this video again
it isn't sponsored though I just really
wanted to try it so
just update you my hair doesn't really
take to the color like as well I think
it needs to like I don't what you call
it needs to like show up a bit more so I
think it's kind of working in my hair
but I have added some pink in as well
just so it can kind of like show a bit
more color although feel like I should
have kind of just stuck with the blue or
the purple cuz I feel like the purple
actually looks so sick so I think I'm
gonna try and go over the whole thing in
purple and just have purple dip dyed
hair for today I know you guys chose
grey but the grey is not showing up and
the purple looks kind of grey anyway so
I'm just basically gonna have to try and
see what I can do to make my hair out
you look like another colour this is as
much as I managed to get it I've managed
to get it to go like kind of gray bluey
purpley colour but it doesn't more gray
than it does blue but I don't want to
put anywhere in my hair cuz I have quite
a lot you know but actually need to use
up where's the purple one and the grey
one I merely used up the whole tubes of
these to do this but I think it actually
looks so cool I always want to
experiment if like it's dipped dyeing my
hair and stuff but obviously this is
just a washing washout one it's not
perfect they're sort of bits of blonde
but everything he looks quite cool for a
really hot summer's day and plus I
thought it'd be cool for the video so
that's the next thing that you guys have
chosen me to do you've chose me to dye
my hair as color I wasn't even going to
do this this was like a
spur-of-the-moment thing but yeah she
looks quite cool for the next one I'm
not sure exactly what I'm letting myself
in for but I am going to attempt to cook
I said should I attempt to cook and 11%
said ill no but 89% said yes so that's
what we're gonna attempt now when I say
cook I mean I'm really not the best cook
I can't cook a lot of things but I
really want to attempt to cook pasta
with like tomatoes in a pasta sauce
member with some cheese like that's a
good thing for me to attempt to cook so
that's my version of cooking don't come
at me I could have just put something in
the freezer but I'm actually going to
attempt to cook an actual meal
I have carbs in tomatoes I've only cut
two up because I've been eating the rest
and my pasta doing good it's boiling
over here I'm really liking it about
five five six more minutes and then I
will sieve this out and then add some
pasta sauce and what gosh maybe I need
to turn this down and I have done it
I've mixed in the pasta sauce it cooked
it in there add some cheese there's some
truly beans in here and some tomatoes
mixed in I'm actually really really
proud of this and now I'm gonna take
this over to the dining room table and
I'm gonna sit here and enjoy my lunch
the next question was which sunglasses
do you think I should wear now I
honestly thought everybody would pick
these ones over these ones I don't know
why I just thought yeah everyone goes
these ones they've actually chose these
ones and at the moment it's on 32% for
the bottom ones 68 percent for the top
ones which I'm personally really shocked
at so I guess we're gonna have to go out
with these ones and I'm gonna have to
wear them pretty much basically I'm
going to meet my friend and I'm gonna
have to wear them pretty much the whole
time while I'm out so that's a little
bit embarrassing because I really want
to wear those ones but let's wear these
ones like seriously how extra I feel so
ridiculously extra in these thing glass
like if I wear them up like this look a
bit dodgy and I've got eyelashes on tile
have to wear them like this it's gonna
be strutting down the street like this
the others would look so much cooler but
at least it's actually sunny
so that actually kind of like cover my
eyes from the Sun a bit even though I'm
still having to squint because the sun's
coming from on top I am now in the car
and I'm with a moment Atticus and I have
just put on the official sixth question
the don't not sure what number it is and
it was where should we go to eat so it
was either between Beatrice first or was
between at bills and everybody has chose
peace it expressed 68% me amongst a me
we actually expected everybody to save
bills we don't know why I didn't think
people would say P to express but we
haven't actually been
all together with big bills we have been
to him foodies reskin his new behind the
roast and lakes one so it's such a nice
day today so I'm really excited
here is our starter we have got dough
balls and to have Atticus also got here
so you too excited your dough balls I'm
so excited to eat me is and our main has
arrived I of course went at the
margherita pizza mum speak so it's
really nice even though she's been
cutting up it was really nice and then
we also got some of these chips to share
but I've never tried before either
elastic this has got but he had dough
balls and he's got Tomatoes there and
chips he doesn't actually like pizza but
he's never tried it he's gonna try bit
in mine aren't you if Atticus is about
to try his first piece of pizza
yeah that's a good bet
his face is so worried there's nothing
on it
we are just walking towards of Primark I
was gonna put the same cheese guys want
us to go to Primark but in preacher the
answer would be yes alright hope it vs
anyway we also just got asked for our
first ever family photo light and I
we've never been together and I'd like
somebody's come up from staff for a
photo and a lovely mum and daughter said
oh you remind us of like me like odd
like what you call it like our
relationship can we get a photo
schoolers haven't really big photo
together which is really cute I don't
know if you can see me so because the
sun's coming from behind me so I'm so
sorry we're just walking down to Primark
I'm really hoping it's gonna be all
things I really want to go to the home
section and then I'll buy something
that's up to you guys never mind you
guys won't decide if I buy something
because that was a completely failed
because for the first time we got here
and the shutters are closed because it's
bank holiday and we forgot yeah shot
Atticus I know how sad for the first
time today we are 50/50 split so do I
have a bath or shower let's refresh it
again and see it was still 50/50 2094
for Bath and 2114 for a shower to anyone
up six minutes though so oh let me play
again I might leave it for a second just
so I get still 50/50 oh my god guys is
so close and we have now changed a 49%
to 51% so a shower one how cute is that
photo we are going to get a shower which
I'm quite happy about actually because
it's very very hot today so I think a
bath would have been too much
we are coming at towards the end of the
day and this is pretty much gonna be
maybe even the last one that you guys
are gonna get to answer and it is shall
I expose a few unseen photos from
another account that I have yes I'm
going to do it because I said spin it
girl 96% and there no CVA was only 4% so
I am in fact going to have to spill some
unseen photos from an account that I
only show my school friends I basically
have an account that is just for my
school friends where I just post funny
like black and white images that I don't
post anywhere else so here's one of them
this is another one of me and stuff I
don't exactly remember what we were
doing but I do remember posting this on
my snapchat with so many posted it on
their snapchat but I don't know what
we're doing and then back in February
when it was Valentine's Day I saw this
massive teddy and cushy girls single as
could possibly be Eyre took a photo next
to it and said well I got my mom to take
a photo of me in it and then I also post
funny outtakes of photos and I took
these well these were like outtakes from
when I was taking an actual really nice
Instagram photo and then this was me in
Paris and I was trying to get a really
cute photo holding my brand-new bag that
I'd bought and it didn't really work out
very cute and I just ended up looking
like this so if you do want to see more
