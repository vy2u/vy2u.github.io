today's video I'm going to be doing a
very requested one it's a spin-off of
the video that I did a few weeks ago and
today I'm going to be letting my
Instagram followers pick my whole entire
makeup look yesterday evening I took to
Instagram and I let you guys decide what
makeup I wanted to use I gave you two
options everybody loved it there were
thousands of votes and I've got all the
makeup that you guys have picked in
front of me today and I'm going to be
creating a makeup look with it so I
really hope you guys enjoy also let me
just quickly point out yes on my chin I
have a massive red spot it won't go down
- fingers crossed I'll be able to cover
it I've got like two little braids and
then in a bun with my hair I had no idea
what to do with my hair and I asked on
Twitter and this was the most popular
response so I thought I would give this
a go just for this video if you do enjoy
it please smash a huge thumbs up and
other than that let's get into the video
the first product that you guys have
picked for me to use is the Smashbox
primer I gave you two options it was
between the Smashbox primer and the wire
sale primer and I can't remember the
split but it will be on screen I love
this Smashbox primer if you guys have
water so in my previous makeup tutorials
you will know that I used to really like
the green one and I still do but it's
ran out and I haven't gone and bought a
new one yet so at the moment I've been
using the normal silicon pry them from
such box and it's also really really
good for foundation that you guys
actually picked the Dior forever
undercover 24-hour full coverage
foundation and I've used this once
before and I'm not gonna lie I didn't
really like it that much I'm gonna give
it another go today and see how much I
like you or still dislike it I'm gonna
put a lot more on than I did the other
day though because when I tested it out
I definitely think the reason I didn't
like it was because I put it on very
sparsely and I really just didn't put
enough on my face to give me the
coverage that I really wanted to flushed
his foundation is claiming to be full
coverage so I am expecting it to cover
basically all the red marks on my skin
another foundation that really
is full coverage from high end if the
Marc Jacobs wife that's probably the
most insane foundation I've ever used
and I would stick to that by far but I
also do like from the drugstore the
L'Oreal True Match but the other option
that I gave you guys was the Rimmel
lasting perfection at 25 hour one so
I've popped all this on my face and I'm
not gonna begin it to blend it it's an
okay color match they did send me this
so I didn't actually get to choose the
color just on my one cheek the web at
the lens and it does look a lot better
than last time already and I'm changing
my opinion on this it looks really nice
and it doesn't really smooth it's
blending really really nicely I'm really
easily as well and it has covered the
spot on my chin I am actually gonna
change my mind on this foundation I
think just last time sometimes I get a
bit like oh I don't want to use too much
because I don't want to waste it but I
felt up with this foundation you do need
to use quite a lot if you want to get
the full coverage like if you use it
sparsely it's just not gonna blend and
cover everything that you want it to but
like I said now put a lot more on the
coverage is great my foundation is on
it's very full coverage I'm very
impressed with this foundation actually
very chewy looking which I do like
obviously until I powder it down but now
I'm going to use your guys's choice of
concealer which was the collection last
infection had a feeling you guys have
picked this one out fill it up again to
the Mac one and I think the collection
one one by quite a lot actually so mine
is in the shade there one I'm just gonna
pop things in all the areas that I
usually do so on my nose under my eyes
on my chin and on my forehead
I feel like oh you to collection
concealer in so many of my videos near
property kind of bored of me always
using this concealer but you guys did
pick it and I really like it so that's
why I'm using it again fun fact I
actually cleaned out my drawers the
other day and I found five empty tubes
at the concealer so that's how much I
love it
so now I've done all my base makeup I
need to powder it down and I only have
one choice of powder so I just thought
there's not really a point in that and
you guys picked this the only powder I
actually have is the Beauty bakery
flower powder so I'm gonna pop this on
and then I'm gonna go straight to
eyebrows in which you guys picked the
Lauria the brand new one the paradise
pomade and you picked this over the
freedom one and again it was quite a
high percentage that picked this one and
I use this in a first impression and a
lot of you said my eyebrows it better
using this than the freedom one which
makes me think that's why you picked it
I'm gonna go off camera I'm going to do
my eyebrows using this as I take you to
do my eyebrows Panama face and then I'll
be back to carry on with my makeup my
brows are on they look actually really
good I feel like I should use this
pomade more often obviously it is really
dark this is the dark shades of what I
use in my previous video but maybe if I
used the shade down from this then I
could use this on my brows now I'm just
gonna brush off all of the powder that I
was baking with whilst I was doing my
eyebrows and then I'm gonna go in and
contour my face up for contour you guys
went with a contour like I've actually
never used before and this is the urban
decay Beach - bronzer this was sent to
my PO box and I just put it in my jaw
because I hadn't used it yet but it was
really really pretty and this one a by a
mile over the revolution one so I'm very
excited to use this I'm just gonna take
my morphe brush I'm not sure how much
we're gonna need some kind just playing
this by ear
okay so the first impression it's quite
a light like I said actually beat you
bronzer it gives like a nice natural
glow I don't fan of this I like this a
lot and I'm just gonna repeat that on
the other side this is a really really
pretty contour it's not too harsh and
it's blending straight into the skin I'm
also just gonna contour my forehead as
Harry's almond Lily dropped it as my
hair is scraped back to the hey stoer my
foreheads bit Wow
and then we'll just contour the other
side it literally is just blending and
melting into my skin I'm living for this
for blush you guys picked a blush that
my honesty and never use I've got it at
beautycon in 2015 whether I should be
using it now I really don't know but you
guys really wanted me to use it and it's
the Tarte blush in shade flush and I'm
just trying to get it open but by rights
I remember yet here we go it's like a
purple I don't know how people into this
is gonna be I think I've used it once
but like I said a few years ago so ok
applying it to my cheeks it definitely
does have the purple undertone to it is
definitely not red undertone that is
really pigmented and there's definitely
gaming like a massive flush back to my
face now we're going to go onto
eyeshadow so I let you guys pick what I
wanted blue or pink eyeshadow and a pink
one I think it was like a
60 40 percent split so I've got two
pallets here that I'm going to be using
to use pink eyeshadow as I don't really
have any really cerise pink I didn't
want to be burgundy so I found two in
this palette this is the clover palette
from Too Faced and I've got these two
here and then I've also got the Mac X
Patrick Starr chord and it's got this
bright pink and then I've got this
shimmery pink here and then again I also
asked you guys if I want to glitter or
no glitter and everybody said glitter
we've didn't shot me at all so I've got
some stars so Mac pigments and then I've
got some gypsy shrine little hexagons
it's a really cute honestly this is
completely like I'm winging this like I
literally don't know what I'm doing so
if it doesn't turn up to good not my
fault I'm gonna start off by taking the
lightest pink color from this two-faced
clover palette that is really Cleveland
today and it's definitely pink this is a
really pretty color it's like a sure but
pinky color really nice I'm gonna blend
it quite far out cuz I probably will end
up cutting it off but as you can see
that's a really really nice color I
think that's so pretty
I love pink eyeshadow I mean it's not
something that I'd wear out on an
everyday basis but I definitely would
wear it to a party now I'm gonna go in
with the Mac X Patrick Starr palette and
I'm going to use the dark pink from this
palette in my outer corner and it won't
open
Oh opening in the wrong way I'm gonna
now use this shade here this does have
shimmer to it but it's very bright and
cerise as I would expect from Patrick
Starr
oh my gosh I'm also going to end up
dragging this underneath as well but
I'll do that once I've done lashes and
Reinert I'm actually living for this
color oh my gosh this is beautiful it's
a way because it's something I've never
normally buy but now I've like done pink
eyeshadow on my arm like I love it so
we've kind of got this little bit of a
fade from like her dark pink going into
a light pink at the moment the pink is
it as light as I wanted to in the inner
corner so I'm gonna do a half cut crease
so I need to get a flat head brush and
I'm just gonna brush concealer from the
inner corner I've showed you guys how to
do this before
this is just my way of doing it you can
do it however you want to so I just get
the concealer here and I just put it on
my eyelid and then I just look up and
creates the lines that I need to fly
around in order to create my cut crease
as I'm just not that good at judging
where it needs to go and then as you can
see you've just got a half cut crease
and you can see where it's gone like
that the color on top isn't as pigmented
as I wanted it to be but that's what I
said earlier so we're just gonna have to
make sure we add a lot of glitter and
again just look up and it will create
the line for you that's both of my eyes
on a cut crease so I'm thinking should I
go in with this really a bright cerise
glitter and then cut the crease like
that I'm definitely not gonna be able to
do eyeliner once I put glitter on though
so I'm like do I do I don't know I do
glitter first I think I'm gonna do
glitter then I'm just not gonna be able
to do eyeliner the whole way across and
I've never used as lifter before it's a
pigment from Mac and it's so pretty
I'm just gonna take a brush and I'm just
gonna take a Cermak below I've got the
Too Faced glitter glue I paid about 20
pounds from this but if the tube is
lasted me forever so I'm just going to
pop this on a brush and then I'll just
you can do up my whole eyelid that's my
whole eyelid glued and now I'm just
gonna dip my brush into the glitter and
pop it on oh my god I'm honestly
wondering why I've never used it's good
to perform why it's just been sat in my
drawer because it's actually insane and
then just brush away your fallout
because officer is gonna be quite a lot
of all that with a loose glitter and you
don't want I now I'm gonna go back in
with some more glue on it the other eye
and then to do the exact same and I also
might add some silver as I feel like
still divine look really really nice
with this side up again
just brush it away you'll fall now and
then that is your first part that I done
because anything this was a proper
spontaneous look I really really like it
now obviously you want to go more on the
glitter before I do my lashes and my
liner so I've got this silver glam
crystal was from a collection and it's
like a just stuff I don't recall you
just basically draw with it so I'm gonna
try and go around the edge of the
glitter just so it's not prominent this
problem is gonna take me a while so I
literally a little contortionist
one part done and it's actually works so
fingers crossed that looks so cool I've
dragged the Silver Line further there
needed to be so you can definitely tell
it's there and I'm just living for this
that part of my makeup is done I am
loving this I've never done anything
like this before I think it looks really
really cool so now I'm gonna go in with
my lashings I hold you this off-camera
as I'm really not good at doing
I like this on camera I'm bike all over
here trying to put them on and then they
just don't go on it's very stressful
process so I'll do my liner I'll do my
lashes and they will come back and
finish the eyeshadow but overall very
impressive this everything is on now and
it's really coming together you can see
how cool it's going to look when I
finish I'm so happy with it you guys
picked some really good makeup now I'm
gonna go in with my patrick stars
palette again and I'm just gonna run the
eyeshadow underneath my eyes so I can
add some like stars and stuff also if
any of you guys are wondering what
lashes I'm wearing I'm wearing the catty
lashes I will leave the exact ones down
below because I'm not sure what they are
I just got them out of a packet that I'd
already use that these are are tatty
lashes and the eyeliner that I use was
the ICO thin eyeliner I didn't let you
guys pick the eyeliner because it's only
one eyeliner that I actually have that
works so I just thought there was no
point I feel like I should out below the
eyeliner and below you I really went for
makeup us together and especially when
you put bottom lash mascara on and again
I'm just gonna do the exact same thing
on the other eye just really about how
like well blended it is because I'm
gonna be adding a lot of silver stars
right now it looks like I've been
punched but we're not gonna go to that
type of look today so I'm gonna grab
these pink hexagons and these silver
stars and I'm gonna pop this underneath
and my eye again using the same brush
and the same blue as I did earlier I
felt like this is more of like a
festival look but believe me this saw
what many more festival looks that I
could do for you guys if you do want to
see a festival look then please do
let me know down below I have to be
really careful with how I place these
okay they've just gone straight away
that doesn't really call those I'm going
to repeat that on the other eye whatever
my gloob has gone there's definitely
enough pink ones on there now I've
literally put so many pink went on I'm
trying to make both sides look as even
as possible but it's really hard I
thought that's fairly even and I want to
go in and ask them little Mac stars
these are so cute
I don't want many stars though I just
want a few little silver stars placed in
between the pink does anything now I've
done that I'm going to go in it with
your choice of mascara which was the bad
gal banger from benefit you guys choices
over there real and I would have to
agree I definitely prefer this over
there real and I'm just gonna blend my
eyelashes into my false ones I've got on
and my first one to just come up and
then I'm also gonna pop it on my bottom
eyelashes I'm what my bottom eyelashes
to be really dark not that you can
really see my bottom eyelashes right now
but it doesn't ten times better once I
put bottom lash mascara wrong now is
time for highlighter which I'm very
excited about a new guy that chose this
one which is the tart tart it's a pro to
glow palette I've been obsessed with
this at the moment you chose this over
what you choose over I don't actually
remember but you guys would have seen
but I really like this highlighter so
I'm going to use both shades and mix
them together I'm gonna do the exact
same on the other side this is really
close to the glitter that's why I'm
being really careful as normally I'd be
quite rough with this but I love this
highlighter but you can just melt into
your face and it's so pretty
finally the last thing that you guys
picked it was this Anastasia Beverly
Hills that lip gloss this is the lip
gloss in toffee and I never normally
wear lip gloss I always go for a matte
lip so you guys chose this over a purple
lip which I'm actually I think a public
would look good but I think missing it
pulled it better
this color goes so well with the item in
color so you guys definitely have my
backs when you pick this hey is that my
finished makeup look for my Instagram
followers to choose my makeup I'm very
happy with it I think it looks really
really good
