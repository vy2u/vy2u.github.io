gonna get straight on into the video so
I hope you guys enjoy it and let's get
started we're gonna kick it off with
three these will YouTube the girl
calling youtubers and I haven't actually
seen any of these below yes that any of
these so we've got Harvey gay I'm not on
you saying either gabriel gabriel
gabriel conte and Jack Maynard okay
gonna go first right perfect
I don't know okay you guys I don't want
to marry ostrog Gabriel because he's so
enough jazz and I think they're the
cutest couple in the entire world
so I'm not going I'm gonna avoid him
Jack and Harvey I would marry Harvey and
I kiss Jack no good I would do the exact
same hey I've never really heard of
Gabriel literally before you just said
it I realized content yeah and yeah I'd
probably marry Harvey and then snog Jack
the next one in every very well-known
youtubers we have got Joe sugg
Caspar Lee and Josh Peters oh okay
finally we're nowhere I'd go with this
one okay well I think I would marry
Caspar snog Joe and avoid Josh just
because I don't know I just yeah I think
I would marry Joe only because I heard
you think he's really funny
I think josh is really funny I think
josh is not told so he's he's out like I
don't know case everything is a project
all that I know
yeah we're really for like five so I
would avoid Josh sorry Josh because I do
love you and he's so nice and so funny
yeah I think I would actually marry Joe
I'm probably kiss class but I think
that's so funny I think Joe like kind of
got my more sense of humor the next one
is three singers and now this for people
but they've chosen three people and
we've got Brad Tristan and Connor from
it oh okay again I think I know what I'd
do with this one I would marry Brad kiss
Connor and avoid Tristan not again any
bad reason that matters why do I love
all of these people that all three of my
really good friends I would marry Connor
kiss Brad and avoid Tristan move on
okay the next one we've already done one
of these people but they've said it
again
we've got Jack Bernard Ben Morris and
Spencer woo okay
marry jack kiss Ben and avoid Spence
sorry
so my fault I think I feel so I feel so
bad for doing this on its neck okay
probably go the other way to you oh okay
I'll be Mary Spencer just because I own
him for like years
mm-hmm I'd kiss Ben and avoid jack just
because I know Spencer and but yeah okay
yeah that's very nice tea I know three
of them yeah we've got Mila Kunis at Kim
K and Kylie Jenner dinner done dad oh I
think me that is the most beautiful
party on this planet order I would smoke
her though I would she seems really
funny that's cuz I cryed he seems funny
hmm I would marry Kylie kiss Mina and
avoid Kim obviously I might also say I
do you know so much as well so next one
is three girls again is all youtubers
and Milly T Lucy flight or Roxy okay so
it's really hard
I would marry Roxy because I feel like
we what actually so weak
she's like a mature grown animal like
she she would have my back right if I'm
editing and like I wasn't getting in the
zone she was like getting enjoyed being
a great partner you know rock said marry
you I would have married Lucy but I
think Lucy we both know that we'd get on
each other's nerves she is my one of my
best friends of and I love her to pieces
but I think we'll drive each other
insane so I would snugly sing and I
would avoid Minnie I would probably do
the same I get I stuck between Mary and
Lucy is very and Lucy or Roxy because
like I'd marry us of both of them like
not yeah yeah so I don't know which way
round but 13 then I'd avoid Millie the
next one is again three boys and we're
going in with all the new hope the boys
so oh okay this way two things up yeah
three of them anyways okay trying to go
fast okay yeah I would probably and this
is not like they're so lovely are all
three of them are so lovely so this is
just like I know I would marry Blake
snog Rhys and avoid George again there

other side avoid Sam but I'd marry Adam

okay I'm gonna marry Jordan I had 100%
marriage oh yeah hundreds it's just the
next term quite a bit on the edge of
that yeah in reality the decision
unloved we'd both not in a nasty way
like personally like it's really hard if
anything to not try to be beefy or
whatever but just yeah it's just past
experiences you know I mean like it's
really hard if I had to just because
like mork's never did like anything that
bad to me just like this is so hard for
me as well because obviously we say
we're married or down yeah um it's so
hard because honestly I don't want to
start going to stories about why but we
all know that Jake was in the nice
member blah but I don't know but then I
just Morgan was sight to you and I just
feel like just such a rather do it to
myself and do it to you like I would
hate to hit a kiss Morgan because I feel
like don't be so down on you yes I
rather do myself I dunno I mean you know
it's really hard I think actually okay
Jake oh I don't know I don't know I have
to because I feel too bad on you I would
never do that boyfriend ever ever so
honestly for like I would have to take
it for the teams that have to do it to
myself
