back and I'm joined with Lia Williamson
and they actually paid to the Arsenal
ladies team and the England lionesses
team which is absolutely amazing and I
was so happy to have her on my channel
but today we're gonna be filming kind of
like a kit bag haul showing you what we
have in our kit bag slash sports bags I
guess and just showing you like a bit
about what we take when you're playing a
football match incredible I'm just doing
pee at school or any kind of random
sports event so if you don't know today
is actually the start of girls football
week which is basically a week where
girls are encouraged to play football
because sometimes football can be seen
they're quite like a manly sport but
it's not girls can play it too and Lee
was like the perfect example of that but
we should play football as well and
that's kind of what we want to encourage
you to do so we're gonna get started
we're gonna show you what we've got in
our bag so if you want to do your first
thing first okay so these are my boots I
have my name when they have something
different written on them so sometimes
I'm at my grandma's initials or like
something like that and but because I've
been injured this this week's all about
me so I've made sure of that
exactly I've got I've got like kind of I
don't know we're just normal trainers
that's a new look and I'm pretty sure
you would have seen these already in a
video they're really day soon all that
oh yeah they've got a little pink thing
on the back and these are from new looks
and you always need these for money paid
sport alright so basically I'm a bit
weird when it comes to my kit so I have
a lucky sports bra that I always have to
weigh I like this orange color
I think it's girly yeah that's really
good yeah I like it I think it's good
makes me look good one on tans
especially which is it was great turns
out to make everything better then I
have a spare one just in case that
anything happens to that one which is
yeah pretty I think there's a presence
more notch it's pretty much and then
obviously if I kind of white kit I don't
want to be there with a black sports bra
something like that so always have to
have something white just in case so
three sports brothers I've been leaving
why not then I've got I don't if you
guys saw you maybe did if you follow my
Instagram whatever but I played at
soccer sticks it's just basically like I
don't know what you really call it's
just an event my IT people don't play
football so I've got my soccer six-top
here for when I played at some cool
clothes smells but it's like I don't
know it's really comfy like in Sochi to
play in well I'm playing sports so I
have this and then I just have my shorts
as well which I'm pretty sure if we sit
it's going to dpe we all have basically
the same short so I've got my shorts
okay so basically obviously I always
have to have my headphones which look
like they're just a box at the minute
yeah so it had really really important
everybody listens to music before a game
especially if the DJ in the changing
room isn't very good but Auslan we have
a great DJ on the DJ England when I go
over the youth age group so really I'm
gonna say okay well yeah obviously
that's before so I always say my head's
my case I also have to have everything
to be my lucky charm so when I don't
bring these we lose and I have 10
minutes and strum related 3/4 pound we
all long back but yeah I don't eat them
all I just have to have them out cause
it's a it's a superstition but I just
throw them into the floor and of course
by the end of the game they're all gone
what's it like good friends on the team
yeah I playing for a team is so good
this people in exactly the same position
as in the state pays for they have the
same lifestyle so they get you and you
get each other which means you'll
probably be better friends and with any
videos because you get like the
lifestyle but we have so many characters
people we have the funniest people on
the air and on team or they can do the
most stupid things but ya know it's
really good and like I said being all in
the same boat everybody get over in this
and my sense of belonging I said yes but
officer again read where he's trying to
get showered and strain in the hair
that's we're not trying to get sorted
after yeah that's on the the conflict
appears I know my girly things so nice
really good so it takes me about like a
half an hour to do my makeup so how does
it take like you and your friends after
okay well I think most of being a
footballer most ghosts used to do like
10 their eyebrows or because it's
convenient it's not gonna wash off and a
lot of the guys I'll teeth like
waterproof mascara my friend that's
comin off she literally has to make sure
that she you know get every eyelashes is
done of the CISO motive that happens at
home and you just come to the game get
ready but afterwards I mean it depends
sometimes people want to just get off
and they need to go somewhere so yeah I
walk out with a towel on their head they
really don't care those fans wait for
pictures but they're like yeah I've got
a good kind of things too that just they
put their hair up work or but if
somebody's getting ready when we won the
FA Cup final its lucky the change room
with me got one believe because oh my
goodness we had hair extensions colors
oh it wasn't enough plugs but those like
12 topaz straighteners and all people
were sharing oh yeah yeah so we could
spend hours after the game if we had it
yeah yeah but normally we're in a rush
to go somewhere so if if we're waiting
to get on the bus and there's one person
yeah you can imagine that yeah I can
watch it it's not great then I've got my
earphones as well I just have these ones
I've had these for absolute ages but
they're so nice and the same thing I
can't do it without music like I know
you it's like motivation yeah I feel
like I'm not 70 yeah it's a cool run
yeah music Stephanie important so if
I've got my headphones and makeup makeup
cause we both have to have makeup I've
seen so I move seems long in the Sun my
eyebrows just disappear they they go as
light as my hair goes and when you run
around a little bit that is not ideal so
I have to do that eyebrows on and
clearance collar off
yes costará the absolute but no running
around the winds it and you yeah
eyebrows did not move yeah it's so
important so I'd say this is actually
both important
yeah and then you got back one of the
most important things in one is powder
because I tend to get oily really
quickly so like as soon as I come off
playing powder is like necessary yeah
it's just necessary so so I've got
makeup bags because you know you just
kind of need them look good feel good
play good exactly that's her motto that
is well I love it that's such a good way
to go oh yeah the base of the in my bag
I also have some really geeky things my
dad voted me in for this is a geeky this
is key but when I was 17 my dad wrote me
a poem for a certain game I'm just about
working hard and everything being wife
in the end so always keep that in my bag
for a little bit of motivation when I
need it when I get nervous I have a pack
of cards always have a pack of cards I'm
gonna get no such a shuffle them and
change anymore play with them or
literally just to distract myself and I
also have an obviously position where I
used to play my Monica I had to teach
myself an instrument so I taught myself
that on the clock so I have to have this
in my bag because once I had it in there
we played good so now I have it I don't
play it for the team or anything like
that
I make guarantee none of them this is
gonna be embarrassing but well yeah just
give a little yeah exactly very good
