back and I'm going to be doing a some
last minute DIY Christmas gift ideas so
I was a completely stuck on what to film
for this week and so many of you guys
have wanted me to do some last minute
DIY gift ideas so I just put my thinking
cap on I don't you spend five minutes
playing out ideas because that's the
point they're meant to be last-minute so
I thought I would just show you in today
and I have four in total to show you I
hope you really chuck if I've got any of
these for Christmas they're really
thoughtful and they're basically
homemade which i think is really nice as
obviously christmas is not all about the
money and it's not all about giving the
most expensive presents it's the thought
that counts
so yeah I really hope you enjoy the
video and let's get started the first
DIY Christmas gift idea I came up with
is a kind of spa night sinaia light in
pamper hamper now this doesn't contain
pampered product even though I've called
it a pamper hamper it contained
basically a ton of food that you would
need for a cinema night in this is such
a cute idea so all you need is some kind
of basket or a tub and the first thing I
did was use these popcorn tubs that I
got from home bargains and for a pound
and I filled them with popcorn now
obviously you're going to need to wrap
this in cellophane because I will
literally wasn't giving it to anybody I
was just making it for the video I
didn't need to do that but I would wrap
it instead a fainter so the popcorn
doesn't go stale so once you're adding
to pop come in I just pop that into the
basket and then I added a ton of other
different snacks so I have some Terry's
chocolate orange toffee crunch pieces I
have some friend hot chocolate which by
the way is really good I had some pink
Smarties and then some Maltese and
reindeers these are basically my
favorite chocolates so I kind of thought
I would make it for myself and eat them
tonight but seriously that's such a cute
idea it's really inexpensive you don't
have much money and as if you're friends
and love watching movies you could even
either put cinnamon tickets in there or
you could put movies in there like DVDs
it's completely up to you and you can
personalize it how you want to and for
whoever you're giving it to you can make
loads of them you can make spa hampers
you could make shopping hampers you
could do loads of different ones but
personally I really like the idea of
cinnamon hamper because a bit of a movie
addict the next idea is a hot chocolate
in a glass now I found this on
tres and it's so so cute all you need is
a mason jar some hot chocolate powder
some marshmallows and some chocolate
chips and then you could also add candy
cane a spoon it's completely optional
all you do is get your mason jar and you
first of all pour a load of hot
chocolate powder or cocoa powder at the
bottom of the jar I would fill it around
1/3 of the way as I don't really use any
more than that in 1 glass of hot
chocolate anyway so I would just fill it
around 1/3 or 1/4 of the way up then on
top of that I poured a load of
marshmallows I think I put about half
the job with marshmallows because hot
chocolate with them and just so good
and then on top of the marshmallows I
poured some chocolate chips and again
you could pour loads of stuff on here
candy cane you could do this for a
cupcake mix a chocolate chip cookie mix
it's completely up to you but I
associate hot chocolate
with Christmas so that's why I did hot
chocolate I actually couldn't find any
candy canes in the shop which was so
annoying but you could definitely take a
candy cane to the side of the mason jar
and a little spoon as well which would
be really cute and I think that would
definitely complete the gift idea but
just pop a lid on it maybe grab some
cellophane around it and you can make a
ton of these for all of your friends and
I'm pretty sure your friends would
literally love them because it's really
last minute it's really quick and it's
just easy to do but a lot of thought has
gone into it the next present is these
hot chocolate dippers and I absolutely
love these I found these on Google
Images and I literally fell in love with
them as soon as I saw them so you need
some sort of tray or a mold I just use
little Tupperware lids
you also need some melting chocolate or
some cooking chocolate some chocolate
chips some marshmallows and some
lollipop sticks or cocktail sticks so
the first thing you want to do is melt
your chocolate in the microwave
I just bought a huge bar cooking
chocolate from Tesco I know I did half
of the bar in the microwave for one
minute and then I just stirred that
around to make sure it was all smooth
and it have no lumps in it I then I
poured of the chocolate into the top of
the Tupperware lids the Tupperware lids
were about this thick they were really
good in thickness so this is perfect and
I just filled them right up to the top
of chocolate literally it smells so good
while I was doing this and if you just
wanted to eat it out so much then once
you've done that you just want to pop a
cocktail stick all right Ollie pop stick
a lollipop stick would be better but I
couldn't find any in the middle of the
chocolate and this will make sure
or you can like dip it into the hot
chocolate and just makes it easier to
hold then you can add whatever you want
on top of the chocolate I decided to go
for chocolate chips and marshmallows but
you could add candy canes you could add
anything really you can even have jelly
sweets if you really fancied that in
your hot chocolate so once I've done
that I just pop them in the fridge for
around 20 minutes and this is really
good like the fact that I only go in for
20 minutes because you're not cooking
them you're literally just popping them
in the fridge and they set perfectly the
chocolate turned out to be so shiny all
around and lit food like I bought them
from the shop and it just dries so
perfectly and they popped out at the top
where it's so easy as well yeah you
could just pop a spoon in with these and
wrap them up in some cellophane with a
little bow and you were good to go
what you basically do with them is you
warm up some milk and then you just dip
it in and it will turn it into hot
chocolate cause you stir it in the
chocolate will melt and everything will
melt and it would just turn out to be
beautiful literally I've already had two
of these and it's so good like I feel
like it's gonna become an addiction but
we'll talk about that later
yeah that's literally all you have to do
so you again you can make these for all
of your friends if you have quite a big
friendship group it's a really
inexpensive way of buying them only gift
the final thing which I'm super excited
about is cookies now these probably seem
really simple but you kind of make it
your own
in the way that you display them so I
just got some Betty Crocker cookie mix
and I just made 12 cookies I literally
just pulled the water in pop them in the
other and I rolled them in the board you
know and wait for them to cook think
they cooked for about 15 minutes
as I said it's all in the way you
display them so you can either stack
four or five up and wrap them up into
some ribbon or you could buy a little
box I have this copper box which I got
from H&amp;amp;M so you can kind of buy a
present but then put some homemade
things in it so I'll just pop some of
the cookies in it and you could even
personalize if I add in a really cute no
and again some bows and some ribbon to
make it a tree Christmassy but again
this is a really inexpensive way of
buying gifts of people and I feel like
the cookies in a box would be perfect
for somebody like my mom or my now
because I know they would 100% love that
so yeah that is basically the end of my
video I really hope you enjoyed it
they're just some really quick and easy
last-minute ideas that I came up with
people have probably done these before
so I really sorry if you have seen them
before but over the other my little
twist on them and you enjoyed let me
