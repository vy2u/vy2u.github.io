doing a autumn lazy day routine so if
you don't know what a lazy day routine
is it is basically a kind of like a day
where you take time out for yourself and
you do things that really relax you and
you just have a really lazy and
enjoyable day now I am going to have one
of these later today it is currently I
think now 2 o'clock yet it's 5 to 2 and
I feel like having a kind of lazy night
but I'm going to show you how to have a
lazy day so I'm going to show you a ton
of different things you can do and just
little things you can make just to kind
of make yourself a more organized yeah
just really really lazy because
sometimes you just got to feel lazy to
be happy because you know what being
Maisie is really good sometimes so yeah
I thought I would do that for you guys
today I really hope you enjoy the video
and let's get started so the first thing
I always like to do on my lazy day
routine is make a cozy little area where
I'm literally going to spend 99% of the
day so some people this could be on sofa
or downstairs but I personally like to
have it on my bed because my best kind
of I feel most coziest and most at home
so I like to just lay out my duvet and
just put a ton of cushions because
cushions that you feel really
comfortable and cozy and guess what
relaxed I'm going to using relaxed and
relaxing a lot in this video so yeah I'm
just gonna apologize in advance but yeah
just make it really really cozy and add
all of your cushions or if your blankets
blankets are the nicest thing I love
blankets and I'd do these everything
like that but that is it the first thing
to do and I just have a little list on
my phone because I'm not gonna lie I
kind of have some ideas earlier I feel
like I'm like together so the next thing
you need to do is snacks so on a lazy
day you need to have a ton of snacks and
a ton of drinks to keep you hydrated and
to keep you going for the whole day so
you can do a varied range of things I
like to have water and hot chocolate I
like to keep glasses of water upstairs
because sometimes I just crave a drink
and I love love water it just flushes
you out and makes you a really really
good but then I also love having hot
chocolate because that makes me feel so
cozy especial
like an autumn lazy day because
automated days are my favorite type of
rainy day especially when the weather
right now it's just so cold and like the
leaves are blowing everywhere on the
boat is just perfect I'm gonna stop but
yet just get some drinks and some snacks
I love to get some brownies some
strawberries some cream that is actually
my fate ever just thought I'd let you
guys know I'm gonna have I'm going on a
birthday no next week it's my birthday
on the 13th and I'm gonna have the
biggest brownie for dessert
sorry the next thing you could do is
organization now even though you want to
spend nights instead of the day in bed
it actually helps to feel a lot more
organized because my feeling organized
you can feel more relaxed said it again
told you but the way I have been
organized is by kind of getting folders
this is to do with schoolwork or any
work really it's kind of like getting
folders and organizing them into
sections all right and our vision notes
anything like that when of this it might
be some people's worst nightmare of a
lazy day and they just want to do
nothing but sit on their phone but for a
lazy day for me I feel so much organized
so much better at the end of the day
said I've been a little bit productive
and I've kind of organized all that so
I'll just organize my schoolbooks and
like all my school homework and papers
and separate folders and I will also
make sure all of my homework it's done
because then at least I know that I
could just do nothing for the rest of
the day the next thing you could do on a
lazy day is start re or journal so I
actually recently went to HomeSense and
if you don't know what home census it's
kind of like her it'll be like TK Maxx
and it's just kind of like random home
bitch you never know what they're gonna
have but I went there and I found the
most prettiest journal and it's kind of
like a notebook but I'm going to turn it
into a journal and I literally love it
so much it was five pounds but it has
about a thousand pages in and the rose
gold and the pastel pink and I decided
to print off some things to go inside of
it so I printed off some food journals I
printed off little like six sheets of
them and this will help me keep track of
what I've been eating not because I want
to get fit or not because I'm trying to
keep track of what I'm eating it's just
really curious to see what you have ate
at the end of the day I just find that
really interesting and yeah I'm just
doing that because I thought it would be
fun and I also keep little to do
I can stick in my journal as well I just
have a little pocket at the front where
I keep them and then if I have stuff to
do I can just write it down and like
paperclip it into one of the pages I
then also have a little kind of October
in there and I'm going to change out
every month so I can just write things
I'm gonna do or anything like that and
you can just write your feelings or you
can do door where you can do anything
but last night I started writing in it
and I wrote in to-do list
and it made me feel so much more
organized and if you kind of get your
feelings and everything down or won't
you've done it you would just feel
amazing so that's definitely something
you could do on a lazy day the next
thing you need to do is have a pamper
bar because I don't think a lazy day is
white without having a pamper bar
because I don't know if it's just me but
I definitely know it as well cuz me and
amber talked about this all the time
where that we have spent a lot of the
day in bed we tend to feel really dirty
like after about four or five hours
because you've just been laying there so
I love love love to get a bath so of
course you've got a new nudes or if your
lash we're soaking blurry or use
everything because you've just gotta
feel cozy and you just gotta feel great
then yeah I'll just use all of my lash
and I just absolutely love it and wash
them in the bath or just read some
magazines or just go on my phone and pay
doodle drugs because Amber's got me
addicted to that game and yeah I would
just do all of that and I really really
like doing all of that it makes me feel
really relaxed and yeah whilst you're in
the bath you could also play it as then
music now you're probably gonna laugh at
me but last Friday I was in the bath and
I was like you know this is so quiet and
it was really nice I was like I feel
like I could add something to it so I
play some Zen music and it was so so
relaxing and it made me feel so good and
I don't know what about the bath I was
like what I felt so calm and she's
distressed it was amazing so do that on
a lazy day get baths because sometimes
you just need one the last thing you've
got to do on a lazy day is Netflix and
YouTube videos how can you not go onto
YouTube and Netflix and just spend your
day on there I'm gonna leave a playlist
we're not plays but like a list of my
favourite Netflix movies I have been
loving area 51 movies and like disaster
movies at the moment on that because I
have
any good movies have area 51 and then 51
51 is my favorite it is insane I've
watched her three times now please watch
it if you have Netflix and then I will
also be watching YouTube videos and I
will tend to watch all the ones in my
subscription box and then go back and
watch my favorite videos from different
youtubers because I think everybody has
their favorite videos you know I mean
maybe like my favorite video every
breath any motors autumn DIY video from
2013 love it all so I will watch like
loads of my friends YouTube's include a
sample Barker who this is a collab video
with so make sure you go and check her
video out because her videos are insane
and I love them so much just so make
sure you go check her video out as well
so that is the end of my lazy day
routine I really hope you enjoyed it
this what kind of just make you feel
more relaxed and just feel more good
about the day and I just absolutely love
having these days and they're my
favorite type of days to have so let me
