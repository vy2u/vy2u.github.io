going to be doing my matte lipstick
collection 2016 so I'm so so excited to
do this video because it has been so
requested and magnetic collection has
always been one of those videos that
I've had my heart set on doing but I've
just never got around to doing it and
I'm finally so excited because I have
the perfect colors of lipsticks that I
wanted to show you and I just cannot
wait this video has been seriously
long-awaited and even though I don't
have the biggest collection I don't have
the smallest collection I am very happy
with the amount I have as I use them all
a lot so in total I have 10 which to me
as I said it's the perfect amount and
I'm so so happy with the colors that I
do have so I hope you enjoy the video
and I'm just going to get straight into
talking about them so I'm going to go in
kind of lightest to darkest order
because I'm going to be putting them on
my lips as well and it will be really
awkward if I go from dark to light so
the first one I'm going to talk about is
a limited edition one and it from the
Cinderella collection and it is called
royal ball and this a lustre finish I
think that's how you say anyway so the
packaging on this one is beautiful it is
a blue like shimmery color with purple
undertones and then the detailing is all
gold and then the actual color is a very
peachy toned pink it's really light it
it's not my favorite color out of my
cold collection but I do absolutely love
this color I don't get as much use out
of this as my others on its own I tend
to mix it with a load of other colors
but I really really do love this color
and as well I know it's irrelevant but
they smell amazing and yeah this color
is just absolutely beautiful so I really
really do love this color it was a very
nice Sheen finish and that's what I
really like about it it's not matte it's
not too shiny it's just kind of the
perfect pink but sadly this one is
discontinued now so you can't actually
buy it which is really annoying the next
one is a crucian finish and it is cream
cup so or creme Cup so this one is so so
pretty it's basically a pastel pink but
it's not a pure pink like the other one
is a little bit darker it has again very
peachy undertones and of course it has
amazing this is a cream machine finish
so it is very shiny very glossy if it
was really amazing
your lips when you put this one on and
this is definitely like a go-to color
like I think you could wear this to
school you could wear anywhere really
you could just chuck it on and it would
look really good with any type of eye
shadow color it's also a great matte
lipstick to start out with if you're
just starting to buy them they're just
kind of the perfect color along with
another one I'm about to show you
another perfect color is angel and this
is my first MAC lipstick that I've got
this is a frost finish so as you can see
it's quite glittery and very frosty it
looks a little bit like ice when you
look perfectly at close to it and it is
a little bit darker than cream cut I
think yeah I think it's a little bit
darker it's more of a ready toned like a
red undertone but it's so so pretty and
again smells amazing because it's a
frost finish I do have a lot of
different finishes this one isn't my
favorite I like the cream cream finish
and I like the matte finish but this is
really really pretty and I do love this
again this is a perfect perfect perfect
for starting out shade so definitely
recommend that one next we have one of
my absolute favorites I love this one so
much it's a cream cream finish and it is
called peach blossom so oh my gosh this
is just so gorgeous like I know all
these shades are very similar but they
come out very different due to the
different undertones so this one again
is quite pinky Bradley undertoned
and it is just so amazing I love this so
much every time I hold them I just going
to spell them because it's also good but
this one's a really nice finish again I
think this will kind of go with any eye
look any skin tone especially I think
this would look really good with either
skintone color and I just really really
like it this is perfect for me and I
could I wear this to school a lot to be
honest just as like a nice little wash
of color just it's more of a natural
color but I really really like it and
again if you're just starting out with
back lipsticks I definitely recommend
this one now we have an amplified finish
and oh my gosh this is one of my
favorite ever colors so this one is
called blankety and it is oh wow it is
basically a perfect nude color
what new lipsticks and my favorite color
I love nude
that sounds very wrong but I'm really
too new to just my favorite lipstick
color to go for I think they suit must
be in time very well I think they suit
quite pale skin tones maybe that's just
me I'm quite different to a lot of
people which like I'm different I think
people think okay just ignore me I've no
idea of what I'm saying but yeah I love
this I mix this a lot with another one
I'm going to show you but it's very
Brown undertone it's really really
pretty
has a little bit of pink shine through
it's a really nice glossy finish and
this is definitely a lighter nude so if
you're going for something a bit Kylie
Jenner but then not as dark I would
definitely recommend this one because
this is what I thought or had in my head
when I bought it and I love this the
next one is my most recent purchase of a
MAC lipstick and this is a satin finish
and this is faux so this is the one I
have on right now this is my absolute
favorite at the moment I think this
probably will be my favorite because I
just love it so much it's basically the
perfect mixture of a Kylie Jenner color
and it's the closest I could find
there also is a lip liner that goes
really well with this but I can't member
the never I think it's called spice but
it's so so pretty and this is definitely
more more I was going to say pink but
it's very very nude it's just a perfect
shade of pink and brown mixed together
and as I said this is a satin finish so
it's quite glossy but then it's not at
the same time it's quite matte I really
really like it I definitely recommend
this and again this goes with quite
coppery eyes and quite pinky eyes so
perfect color for me and I just
absolutely love this I've just realised
how many times I've said absolutely love
this so I'm very sorry if that annoys
you but I do just love everything so
much and I have no other words for them
the next one is a lustre finish and this
is called hugged me so I got this for my
birthday a few years ago and you can see
I have used it a lot that is how much I
have left of it
it's very curved now because I literally
have used it so much it actually looks
like it's drying out a little bit like
it looks quite frosted on side that is
probably because I've used it so much
but this is a very dark nude this is one
of the darkest nudes I think I would
probably wear myself because I don't
want to go too dark I often mix this
with fo and blankety and that kind of
creates my foot my perfect lip color
like I love Kylie Jenner's lip color
do only one of our lip kit but they just
sold out like that so I couldn't get one
but I just in today I'd mix my MAC
lipsticks but yeah I absolutely love
this shade because it is the last to
finish I really really like it luster
and cream machines are definitely my
favorite finish but this mixed with faux
no words then have an absolute classic
this is a matte finish and it called
velvet teddy
Lewis actually got me this one as well
as a Cinderella one and you can see how
much I've used it right this looks more
Brown than it actually comes out on your
lips which I do know it's kind of a good
thing kind of a bad thing it could put
me off buying it but Louise got me this
and I just if you screamed when I saw
that you got me in this color because
it's people's favorite everybody loves
it I love it because it's a matte finish
and I think matte lips look absolutely
beautiful I will offer put faux on top
of this because photo is a perfect color
to make it in to the perfect color that
didn't make no sense but this makes your
throw is amazing and yeah as I said this
is a matte finish it's a really nice
finish on the lips and I really love
this color I think this would look
really good on any skin tone as well and
this is one of my probably top three I
then have a more pinky shade and this is
a lustre finish and this is called a
love Lord moly Jade actually got me this
in a swap walking in awhile back and
this is a very not Barbie pink but it's
the pinkish color I have I don't get as
much use out of this as my others
because I said I love news but I still
do love this one again because this is
more of a pink I would wear this to
somewhere like school or just really
natural makeup look because I like I
like round pinks with natural makeup
books so you're absolutely loved this
sounds amazing
again as every matte lipstick ever does
but I think this would suit light skin
tones as well and all tickets to lustre
finish it's quite frosty quite shimmery
it's really pretty
my final lipstick is one of my all-time
favorite
I will rebuy this until there's none
left in the world because I love it so
much and this is rebel this is a very
very dark purple toned red and it comes
out so red when you put it onto your
lips but not so bad that it's a pure red
it's like a purple toned red and it is
beautiful this was one of my first MAC
lipsticks that I got I knew I wanted
this one but
so many people had it and I just
absolutely loved it and I just love this
so much it's a satin finish or just
amazing and I wear this one a lot if
you're ever seeing me wearing or bread
in my videos it's most probably this one
because this is the one I get my few
style of so if you're looking for a
perfect right go for that that was my
mac lipstick collection 2016 I really
hope you enjoyed it I just have them
like all lined up in this cute little
pot here and I just love Mike lipsticks
or some of my favorite lip products
actually they probably are my favorite
yeah I hope you enjoy the video let me
know if I did by giving it a huge thumbs
up and I will see you in my next video
