started
starting off on the top of my onyx
Shores I first still have this Bath &amp;amp;
Body Works pumpkin pecan waffle candle I
literally love this so much it has the
prettiest copper lid and it has three

just leave the lid off the smell
overrides the room I literally love it
and then I have this school report it's
just white from Ikea and I just have
some artificial roses in here which I
got from eBay for a few pounds if I can
still find them I will link them down

drama the new L'Oreal one which is
amazing
bourgeois roller lash collection
Maybelline L'Oreal benefits all of these
mascara is really good I only keep
mascaras that I genuinely do use if I

Maybelline brow drama
I have benefit they're real eyeliner
benefit no sorry collection extreme
eyeliner some Lancome eyeliners I don't
get much use out of all that stuff
because I don't tend to wear eyeliner
and I only really put clear brow gel in
my eyebrows like gimme brow which is a
little bit tinted but other than that I
don't really use those products too much
I also have these by wet and wild
they're just these single glitter
eyeshadows I am absolutely obsessed with
these at the moment these are my go-to
glitter eyeshadows if you haven't got
these already go onto Amazon they sell
them on there for around 6 pounds I
would 100% recommend them moving on to
my palette drawer which is definitely
one of my favorites I first all have the
Too Faced chocolate bars palettes I love
these I have the Naked on the Run
palette and underneath that I have all
four naked palettes as you can tell I am
a little bit Urban Decay obsessed I then
have the top lip in bloom palette which
is again my 100%
a pallet I literally could not fault
this at all the colors in this are
exactly what you want in a makeup
palette for me and I literally love it
so much I then have the Urban Decay
alice-in-wonderland palette which again
I love and down here I just have the MUA
illicium palette I have the Maybelline
the blushed nudes
I have Maybelline the normal nudes then
I have a bunch of body shop products I
love their palette sees the
down-to-earth palettes then they have
the 17 easy on the eye this one is my
favorite one because I'm quite like much
the fair like pink tones this is perfect
for a night out and this one would be
perfect for kind of like daytime use and
then back here I just have the Urban
Decay Naked basic palette I'm ready to
use these more because this palette is
like one of my favorites are you to use
it all the time then for some reason I
just stopped and then I also have the
two fate boardwalk eyes palette which is
like one of my favorite palettes as well
all of these palettes are my favorite
okay I know I say it about every single
palette but I just love them all so much
so as you can now see we are moving on
to my lip drawer and I just thought it
would be easier if I took off all of the
lids just so you can see the shades so
at the back here I have all of my MAC
lipsticks most of them look similar but
they all have different finishes and
different tones to them hence why I have
different ones then in front of that I
have 10 Urban Decay lipsticks these are
very adventurous shades as you can see I
love this one here and I love this one
here the others I don't tend to wear as
much because they are not really me and
they're quite out of my comfort zone
down here I then have some Rimmel Kate
Moss lipsticks I have benefit penny
bombs I have for barium lipsticks which
I love the shades of hence why they're
so used and then all down here I have 24
Baby Lips
I am so like eBay you a little obsessed
and I'm not even ashamed to admit it I
literally love them so much I love the
doctor rescue ones especially this one
this is my favorite and I also love the
new ones that they have brought out this
year then down here I have my most used
nude lipstick so I have Kylie Jenner lip
kits too faced melted maps and a stage
or in milkshake I have NYX lingerie I
have to face melted these are like my
go-to lip colors here and these are
basically the ones I wear all of the
time and then
the back I just have a bunch of
lipsticks I don't really get much wear
out of I do love this I just don't wear
it as much and I just have a few others
from NYX bourgeois et cetera and then I
have all of the Maybelline Baby dips lip
glosses and behind here I have around 10
US lip balms because as you can tell
them slightly obsessed with lip balm I
would definitely say that this lip draw
is my favorite just because of how its
laid out and all of the different shades
and choices I have I'd actually love it
so much and I'm so grateful for this job
to prefer to even be in my life so I
really hope you enjoyed this video I'm
not bragging or showing off you guys
requested it so I just wanted to show
you it I get used to have it all at some
point so no hate please but yeah I know
it also so so much and I'll see you in
next week's video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
