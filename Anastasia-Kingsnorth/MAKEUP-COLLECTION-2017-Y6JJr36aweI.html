back and I'm going to doing my updated
makeup collection for 2017 so maybe
around six months ago now I did a makeup
collection and I'm always requested to
do an updated one just because I do get
sent so much makeup and I often kind of
give things away to my family and add
new things in and change all around so
it's always always updated and I also
never really show anything like brushes
or my other things that I keeping other
drawers so this time this is going to be
the ultimate makeup collection so yeah
those what are we doing today let's see
if we can stash ten thousand likes on
this video because we've been doing that
recently which is insane so let's see if
we can do it again and I really hope you
enjoy the video so getting in to my
makeup collection I first of all thought
I would show you guys some of my
favorite brushes so at the back I have
my two Beauty blenders I have the Real
Techniques from which I use for baking
and then I have a genuine Beauty Blender
which I use for foundation and a
concealer then I have my three re
techniques
bold metals brush is how I use this one
that for powder I use this one for
concealer to shape my eyebrows with and
then I use this one for highlighter then
I have my zoeva two to seven luxe soft
definer brush which is gorgeous I use
this for inner corner highlight I then
have some tweezers I have a Lille
England
eyebrow brush which they sent me which I
absolutely love and then I have a Real
Techniques tiny concealer brush which I
also use to carve out my eyebrows then I
have two western wire brushes which I
use to wipe off baking powder and to
contour with so that's just kind of an
array of my favorite brushes before I
get into my actual makeup collection
because I never really show my brushes
but I have a lot that I love starting
off on the top of my Alex drawers it's
pretty similar to how it was a few years
back to be honest I really like how I
laid this out so I just have an IQ score
pot at the back then and a plain white
color then I just have these pink roses
which I got off of ebay if I can still
find them I will link them down below
but I doubt obso be able to find them I
then have this IKEA candlestick I really
do love this I found this off of a girl
called Anna Dragonetti and she deleted
her makeup collection which I'm really
sad about it was my absolute favorite
then on top of that I just have my bath
and Bodyworks candle in maple cinnamon
pancakes this is the candle that I got
for Christmas and I love it it smells so
good and then here I just have a little
skewer play again from Ikea with two of
my all-time favorite L'Oreal lipsticks
