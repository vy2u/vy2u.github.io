that this is at my face drawer so we're
gonna start with all of the foundations

the L'Oreal True Match we've got two of
these in two different shades Maybelline

good the Mac Pro Longwear which is my
everyday mix with the L'Oreal True Match
and then to face are born this way and
then the Make Up For Ever HD foundation
I used to have
a lot more but i decluttered them so
i've basically only got one that i
genuinely am going to use moving on down
here i then have a compartment for all
of my concealers the first of all I have
two you can see the pallets I've got the
next one which as you can see is it very
well used and then I've got this matte

they are amazing
underneath that I've got two more color
correcting ones a purple one and a
yellow one
then I've got my Mac Pro Longwear

to not get so much out with one time so
it's really good then I've got my Kat
Von D concealer which is mainly running
out got my Maybelline instant and the
age rewind I've got my Tarte shape tape
which I managed to get off QVC which was
your best delivery of my life then I've
got my NARS one and then finally down
here I have got a la girl liner which is
really good but I don't really use that
often and then I've got the little
collection primer back here is all of my
primers so as you guys can see I've got
quite a few benefit ones so I've got the
benefit Porefessional matte gel I've got
a ton of the pore fessional I've got my

amazing and the benefit like blotting
stick then back here I've got my Mac oil
control ocean which I use every single
day and then I've got two of the mac
fix+ 'iz and then right at the back I
have a collection concealer palette but
this is actually believe it or not my
foundation and concealer draw
decluttered I do class at it a lot so
these are only products that I genuinely
do use all the time and each of these
products have been used - this one so
yes this is my first drawer
moving on into my second drawer this is
where I keep my powders at blushes a
highlight and bronzers over
I've got my Oprah highlights I've got a
top blush Milani blushes two-faced

then I've got the benefit what up the
benefit Porefessional pore minimizing

highlighter palette this is a blush
palette they're both from sleek this is
amazing though then I've got the two

blush if I was gonna wear a blush every
day which I occasionally starting to do
now it is a hundred percent this one
down here I then have all of my benefit
products - this one which is the NARS
blush in orgasm if I can quickly open it
for you guys this is an amazing brush as
well it's so beautiful I've got the
benefits California I've got the hoola
bronzer number ten rocket or sugar bomb
what is this one it's just oh this is
the new dandelion highlighter and this
one actually has my name on it which is
amazing and then I've got a mini hoola
bronzer which also has my initials on it
they are literally so my favorite ever
products because they have my name on it
then I've got the CRT London highlighter
which is really good as well you guys
are gonna see how beautiful this is
it is literally incredible it's very
white toned so I wouldn't use it all the
time but it's really good ready to use
it then down here I've got my Urban
Decay all nighter setting spray and then
moving to the back of my drawer I have
Lancome's new cushion highlight I spoke
about this in a vlog it's really hard to
open but whether you go you basically
open it up like this and then take this
off and it's basically like a foundation
II cushion liquid highlight
is really really cool I probably should
use it more to be fair but if you guys
would like a first impressions on this
do let me know
then it back here I've got my Mac soft
and gentle and my Rimmel stay matte
powder this is beautiful I love this so
much I use it nearly every day as well
then like I said back here I've
basically got a ton of pallets so I've
got my South X makeup revolution
highlighting palette which is my
everyday highlighting palette literally
in my last God knows how many Instagram
post this is what I'm wearing
it's actually incredible this shade well
basically all these features are my
favorite and this shade as well I love
it then back here I've got my Anastasia
contour kit underneath that I've got a
glow kit I've got the nip and fab a
highlighting palette I've got quite a
few different highlighter palettes and
then I've got this Too Faced beauty
wishes and sweet kisses tin which is
also amazing I love this so much I also
have the laura geller
baked gelato swirl illuminator palette
beauty base sent me this and it's
absolutely gorgeous and that kind of
makes up the majority of this draw I
have quite a lot of highlighters so I
don't really need to buy any more to be
honest but yeah love this jaw so much
then moving on to my third drawer down
this is where I keep my mascaras my
loose glitters eyeliners mascara is I
think of some scarlet already for
everything like that so first of all
over here I have all of my eyeliners and
glitter glues and primers I've got the
master precise eyeliner from maybelline
I've got the benefits they're real
eyeliner seventeen make your mark which
is amazing then as you can see I've got
two of the Too Faced glitter glues
this is the best politically you're ever
going to buy it honestly then I've got
the Urban Decay eyeshadow primer which
is my favorite eyeshadow primer and put
duo lash glue which is definitely my
favorite lash glue then when I don't
feel like using the Too Faced one I have
a NYX blister primer I've got some
benefit brow products you've got the
gimme brow your high brow and we've got
some NYX jumbo eye pencils in about
every shader is going because I love
those so much then I've just got some
more lash glue I've got the Revlon one
but this is literally completely worn
down then we've got some more benefit
products the brow
there's another gimme brow yet another
gimme brow and then we've got another
browser setting gel there then we've got
the collection glam crystals and these
are so beautiful I wish I suited silver
more but I want to get some of these in
gold that's going to be everything in
the first compartment and then in a
second compartment I keep all of my
glitters so I do have my brow protein
here which is the anastasia beverly
hills dipbrow but then other than that
all these are loose eyeshadows and
glitter so I've got two color pop
eyeshadows which are really good then
I've got some glitter so this one is
from new look this is from ebay I think
that was from eBay I've got the NYX
glitter tower which I love I've got some
Mac pigments this one is my favorite but
this one is super super critical like
dress up stuff everything like that
got the la splash glitters which
actually are my favorite some more new
look ones then I've got eight gypsy
shrine one which I really like and then
we've got some wet and wild ones these
are like compact explicit so I got when
I was in America then I have a Mac Paint
Pot in painterly which I should use more
often
so there's I'm not that keen on that one
but should probably use it then I have
one of my favorite ever compartment
which is my mascara so if you guys have
been following me for a long time you
will know that the lash sensational is
my ultimate favorite mascara it's eight
pounds from the drugstore I literally
could rave on about this forever then
I've got my L'Oreal miss baby roll which
I actually really like for my bottom
eyelashes I've got the Maybelline faux
sills push-up angel then I've got to
face better than sex which is really
good I haven't used that in a long time
but another one of these the forties
push-up drama this mascara from Mac is
called bad lash a button a bold and bad
lash it's completely ran out because I
loved it so much then I've got the black
version the lash sensational at the new
Urban Decay troublemaker mascara which
is amazing I've got one from Lancome
some benefit one some more L'Oreal ones
then I have actually been using this
quite a lot recently this is the
Maybelline the big colossal shot and
then finally I've got benefit roller
lash I don't really
never wear mascara like I feel like
mascara kind of makes my makeup look is
that just me you just look so much
better but this mascara the black one
and the mark one are definitely my
favorites although I do love this one as
well then at the back of the drawer I
just have some palettes that I couldn't
fit in my palette drawers so if I can
get it out I've got the Urban Decay
ultimate basics palette which is amazing
I don't think I raved on about this
enough to you guys but it's so good it's
filled full of beautiful matte colors
and then back here I have my Z palette
which has some makeup geek eyeshadows in
which again definitely didn't rave on
about all I can feel another palette
underneath that what on earth is this
one I also have my tartlet in bloom
palette which again is incredible
they're bringing out another one of
these I haven't used this in so long
actually but this is one of the best
eyeshadow palettes ever that is it for
the palette it's in this drawer so now
we're gonna move on to my next palette
drawer which is full of all of my other
ones so here is my palette draw on top
here I've got my violet Voss a pro
eyeshadow palette if you guys have seen
me do like orangey makeup looks I can
guarantee that it's from this palette
right here how gorgeous is this this is
showing up a lot more pinky on camera
but it is gorgeous whiney red and it's
just amazing a violet for eyeshadows are
a crazy formula I love them then I've
got my Naked palette so I've got Naked 3
and Naked 2 and naked smoky and then
down this right here I've got my naked
he Urban Decay Naked palette just like a
classic for every single makeup
collection over here I've got my two
Naked basics palette I've got the Naked
basics one and the Naked basics two
naked basics one is it definitely my
favorite I actually really like to keep
this as a compact in my herb bag then
I've got the wet and wild of ever so
famous walking on eggshells palette do
you guys remember like if you're proper
oh geez when everybody used to rave over
this and then I managed to buy it in
America I think it was like three or
four dollars and it was the best thing I
ever bought I then have this is too what
Mac duo here which is really cute don't
really get much use out of it I do
really like the colors and I've got
again one of my all-time favorite
palettes this is the Anastasia Beverly
Hills modern at renascent
if I can get this open to show you guys
pretty sure you would have all seen it
already because it's genuinely one of
the most raved about palettes but it's
so
for every single shade in here I get use
out of then I've got the Too Faced
chocolate bar so I've got the semi-sweet
and at the normal one and then back here
I've basically just got a ton of
eyeshadows that are very very colorful
so I don't really get to use that often
but I've got the Alice and wonderland
palette I've got the Urban Decay a full
spectrum palette and then I've got my
morphe palette which actually I haven't
used in a long time because I really
want the morphe 35o and oh I have
another wallet this is sweet as candy
from Wet n Wild again that was another
one that people absolutely raved about
please tell me you guys remember that it
wasn't just me because I don't even
think I use it that often when I got it
but so so good out of all of these I
would definitely say my favorite is
either the violet boss or the Anastasia
Beverly Hills one or even The Naked
basics because it's such a nice pretty
basic palette to have it also has a
really decent sized mirror as well and
some people used to say they use this
show to thin their eyebrows so that's
different but I really like this palette
we are now venturing in to what is one
of the most full packed drawers in my
whole makeup collection and this is my
lip drawer so you might think oh yeah
the top layer is it know so let's just
lift this off and see what's underneath
so underneath I basically have a
lipstick shop I have about every single
shade that is off the NYX ones as you
guys can see but we're going to go in
order so down here I've got the
Maybelline rock soros collab I've got a
ton of urban decay lipsticks these are
the Gwen Stefani ones and these are the
vintage ones and then I've got down here
the Alice and wonderland ones these are
some of my favorite packaging and then
I've got a wire sale one Posey bomb I've
got some of the Too Faced moated Leigh
Texas I don't really get as much use out
of these as I would like because that
these colors aren't really me but I
still wanted to keep them because they
were very expensive as you guys can see
I have literally every single shave
there is or the NYX lingerie lipsticks
these were highly gifted to me when I
went on a two-day spa trip to tooten
Glen with NYX to launch their Christmas
range they gave me all the NYX lingeries
and all of the NYX liquid suede and I
think if I pull the drawer a little bit
more which I don't exactly want to do
it's probably gonna fall out
have all shade back there as well and
another row I also have some lime chrome
lipsticks back here again but to be
honest I don't really get much use out
of those these shades however I get so
much use out of and these liquid Suede's
are amazing as well I hadn't tried these
before they gifted them to me I tried
the lingerie ones but not the liquid
suede and they are just honestly
incredible now moving on it to the top
layer of my lipsticks I have all of my
everyday ones that I genuinely do use
and love so these are all kind of my
dark colors so I've got Kylie Jenner
ones I've got two faced melted ones this
is a really nice one this is the Urban
Decay vice liquid lipstick in a rapture
really really like that I've got some
Gerard cosmetics
I've got color pop color pop Viper is
probably my most used red ever I really
need to do another color pop order
because I cannot even tell you guys how
amazing these are oh yeah I've got a ton
of the jarred cosmetic ones I've got
some more mini color pop ones some Too
Faced melted ones just oh and this one's
really nice I want to say this is called
poison but it might yes it is called
poison Anastasia Beverly Hills in it
poison it's near enough black but my
nails are black and this it's purple but
when you put it on your lips it comes
out like nearly black and it's so
beautiful in the middle section I have
my nudes which is probably my most worn
color ever so I've recently gotten this
one this is the oh this is even a nude
this is meant to be in here but it's a
food of beauty one I have got another
Hyuna Beauty one though and it's this
one here
this is in the shade Medusa and it's a
really nice purple toned nude then I've
got my color pop ones again trap and
MIDI which of these two are some of my
favorite ever shades I love them and my
most worn lipstick ever is the Too Faced
melted Maps in a child star this is the
best thing I've ever bought then I've
got some Kylie Jenner ones I've got some
more color pop ones quite a few Kylie
Jenner one dr. differ how many I had
then I've got some Anastasia Beverly
Hills and in milk shape is amazing
Gerard cosmetics

then what else do we have in here we got
another color pop one this is the Amanda
steel X color pop satin lip and yeah I
just love new lipsticks I'm absolute
favorite shade or like I said color pop
ones and Too Faced melted Matt's are my
ultimate ultimate faves well this is
really nice well this is probably Jenna
love bite this is a bit of a darker nude
and then we've obviously got Kandy K
which was an absolute classic and then
I've got the cute lip gloss then down
here I have all of my MAC lipsticks so I
have to sample lipsticks of the Nicki
Minaj collection because matte quite
actually nice enough to give these to me
so these are actually samples but
they're really really pretty nudie
colors they literally just right at my
street this one is super super pretty as
well this is a bit more of a nudey pink
color but love the packaging of these
like how gorgeous are they then we have
all of my MAC lipsticks so I have the
Cinderella one down here which Lewis
actually got me and what's that cleats
babe then I've got this liquid lipstick
in the shade bunt spice and this is
again one of my most worn nudes I love
this so much
and then we've obviously got all of my
MAC lipsticks here I have I think well
five ten I think I've got twelve or
maybe I've counted that wrong I don't
know that really good annoy me and I've
just got a mixture of shades here I've
got velvet teddy I've got Angel I've got
rebel god-knows-what this shade is this
is shade to hug me this is a really nice
nude I remember lads actually very used
I that you don't really wear my MAC
lipstick as much as I probably should
these are really good formulas but and
they deserved that one case is that
velvet teddy
that's velvet teddy do you remember when
the heighth a little bit Teddy glittery
everyone so mad they were like it's
collagen of color everybody has to be
wearing it this angel this is a blankety
I remember this used to be one of my
favorites as well but yeah so I have
quite a few my clips I think I've got 15
in total now a - the this one so that's
really nice but yeah that is basically
all of my lipsticks this is the draw
that you guys that never really get to

face masks my skincare Beauty blenders
everything like that
first of all I've got a bun
of eyelashes I've got some benefit ones
I've got red cherry I've got a did have
House of lashes but I've used them up

it literally drives up overnight it's
incredible then I've got another glam
glow face mask this is the orange one
it's just a grat no this is the flash
mud which is really good I've got some
Beauty Blender cleaning stuff then down
here Beauty Blender actually gifted me a
ton of them so I've got like loads and
loads of spare ones I've got these two
down here I've got a pink one the green

Hannah mask but I love sheet mass so
I've got loads of hollow and glow I've

master description box which comes to me
so I've got loads of gold ones and then
that's pretty much it other than back
here I have the L'Oreal clay ones which
are really good as well but this is
basically just a draw-off pampering for
me as stuff I use on to be honest and
everyday basis I just kind of go to this
drawer grab things out whatever I need
it it's a really handy draw to have and
then it finally in here I just have a
few random bits oh I've got some hair
burst shampoo and conditioner and my
vitamins which I like to take then I've
got a newest skincare range which was
sent to me which I'm going to try I've

a little bit that is basically
everything having their again just
