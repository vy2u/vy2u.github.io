back and I'm go doing makeup products
that you need to try now before I get
into this video I'm so sorry for my
voice I am so ill letting my makeup
wench so bad today because I just don't
have much energy at all so I'm so sorry
about that I do feel really ill I'm
really croaky and I wasn't really in the
mood to film the video wanted to film
because I want to put my foot on effort
into it so today I'm going to be doing a
sit-down chat evideo to you guys I tell
you about my favorite ever makeup
products I do apologize for how I look
as well I know my makeup looks out of
you all for today and I just look ill
but there's no way that I'm missing an
upload for you guys no matter what so of
course I still wanted to feel yeah other
than that I really hope you enjoy the
video and let's just get started up
I literally spoken about so many times
but I know how many of you guys love it
and it is the l'oreal true match
foundation now honestly nothing it comes
close to this foundation this is my holy
grail foundation this is a brand new
bottle that i had to buy like last week
i think because my other one is it she
like ran out and I have definitely gone
through at least 5 bottles of this in
the past year it's really long lasting
but I need a lot of coverage because I
have quite a few spots at the moment so
I use like normally like two pumps per
foundation day if that makes any sense
but this retails for nine pounds
ninety-nine and apparently the new
L'Oreal infallible foundation is really
good I've bought it but I haven't
managed to try it yet so I will let you
guys know about that but this one is my
absolute favorite and I would most
definitely recommend it it's good for
oily skin and it's good for dry skin I
feel like it's better for dry skin
because my oil does still seep through
drew out the day but this is really good
and juhi to blend on oily skin so I
follow use with a mixture but I really
like this and I have a super oily skin
and it works great the next thing is a
concealer now I think I'll show this in
a haul but I haven't like said my
opinions on it and it's the NYX full
coverage concealer and it's just in this
little pot like this mine is in the
shade number three which is light and I
feel like I should have got number one I
feel like this is still a bit too dark
for me but I use this to carve out my
eyebrows I don't actually use it for
like a coverage concealer because I
prefer using like the NARS creamy
concealer or collection but I use this
to carve out my eyebrows with
I feel like it works really well like
it's really Jimmy just kind of slide
round them on a little row techniques
detailer brush and I really like it I've
been this retail for about five pounds
fifty and you can get it from boots or
online or Amazon probably so yeah I've
really really enjoyed it and I
definitely recommend it the next product
I'm absolutely obsessed with and I
recently bought it actually like when
did I buy it like last week yeah last
week I bought it and it is the Laura
Mercier translucent setting powder so I
tried this when I went down to saffron's
and it was incredible I've never tried
anything like it honestly and my skin is
so oily and none of my oil came through
it was like a revelation had happened
like it was genuinely the best thing
ever so I was like okay no Anastasia
just buy it
it was 29 pounds but it is genuinely
incredible it is translucent but I think
it does give a bit of coverage and to be
honest for 29 pounds I feel like you get
a lot of product in the pot and the pot
feels very expensive it doesn't feel
like cheap and plasticky like not heavy
but like it is for a powder so like I
think that's really good obviously the
price tag isn't what we want it to
necessarily be but if you guys are
looking on like spending a little bit
more on a really good powder if you do
have oily skin then I would definitely
recommend this to bake with the next
thing I've actually never spoken about
in my videos before and I don't know why
because I'm obsessed I have on the end
of my nose here and it is the sleek
makeup palette in Cleopatra's kiss it's
just this gorgeous gold palette and then
when you open it it's got four gorgeous
highlighters in it two of them a cream
two of them a powder and genuinely I
absolutely love this it was ten pounds
and I just think you're such a cute
little compact to have like the
packaging feels quite light and airy
fairy which is nice but the product is
so beautiful inside like I said I have
it on my nose today and I am just
obsessed with it it's so beautiful I
have it here but I don't know how well
you can see that but here is the gold
shade and I'm like eyeing the next
product I would recommend is now this is
two one here and this is the Ardell
medium brown brow pomade and this is
what I use to fill in my eyebrows that
was my phone so so many people asked for
you to fill in my eyebrows and is this
Android uses with a little
England brow brush and it's so good I
don't give me this and I was at
beautycon you can see how much I've used
after pot but I am so going to rebuy
this eye I generally don't know what I
would use on my eyebrows if I didn't
have this I think it's only 5 pounds and
it's a really good jute for the dip brow
pomade anastagia because i have that as
well and i've compared them and i
actually think i prefer this but yeah i
just really like it so I would recommend
this if you're looking for a good I
reproach or starting out because I only
started feeling my eyebrows in less than
like 4-5 months ago so I love this next
up our mascara is now I bloody love
mascara 'he's absolutely love them like
my eyes are looking a bit today because
I'm just really not having a good day
but nevertheless we've talked about
mascaras so these two are my Holy Grail
these are the Maybelline lash
sensational ones this one is a luscious
oil blend and this was just the usual
one now this is very very blackening if
that's a word in major I'll actually
look so black and so thick and then I
just use this one to separate out I just
really like it and I like how the
packaging compliments its complement
each other I just think that's really
nice and because I like aesthetically
pleasing things that really makes me
happy I just literally love these so
much and I would 100% recommend them
also for Maybelline I have the falsies
push-up drama and I just really like
this this is really good I rediscovered
it about a month ago and the brush isn't
actually like it doesn't look that
amazing but it genuinely is I'm actually
losing eyelashes on my eyes which is a
bit weird it's a bit worrying but this
kind of makes it like I are I'm opening
this kind of makes it look like I'm not
losing them even though I am but it just
separates them out it looks so nice and
fluttery so if you're looking for any
mascara this one on the lash sensational
eyeshadow palette now anastasia beverly
hills modern a toms palette this is my
absolute go to i genuinely don't know
what other palette I would use if I
didn't have this now it has such a nice
array of nudes but then like perfect or
to me
spring/summer colors on just like this
is MIA palette I look at it and it makes
me so happy just like staring at it I
don't know I just love it there's so
many map shades and there's also a few
shimmery ones which is nice and your
course care a little mirror with it as
well which is nice and I just like the
packaging
everything about it is just so me and
the colors are if anything too pigmented
like that we're like you're saying all
the colors are too pigmented but they
are so pigmented like genuinely you dab
your brush in once that's enough but
that's a good thing because then you
won't need to like rebuy the palette if
anything and I feel like every color I
would use like the same so I don't just
like oh I hate that one but I love that
one so when I want to rebuy it
I just want to rebuy one color while
rebuy all of them so I think that's a
really good thing as well but yeah I was
absolutely love this and would
definitely definitely recommend it
finally I have two lip products to talk
about you guys the first one is from
colour-pop now this isn't as easy to get
hold off they do ship to the UK but you
do get a customs charge and it can be
fairly expensive but I just want to talk
to you guys about it anyway just in case
you are able to get hold of it
this is the colour-pop liquid lipstick
in the shade and I think this is
absolutely gorgeous like genuinely I'm
full-on in love with this and I don't
know what I would do without it like
this is gorgeous don't have it on today
I've got the other one that I'm going to
show you on today but this I think it's
about 5 pounds it's actually not the
lipstick that's expensive
it's the shipping and that's so annoying
but if you can't get hold of these these
are so long lasting so Velveteen so soft
and I just absolutely love it so I would
definitely recommend them and finally I
have some lipsticks from Gerard
cosmetics now you can get these on
beautybay I believe they retail for
around 11 pounds they are smaller than
colour-pop but they are amazing I have
the shade on skinny-dip at the moment
and I just think it's gorgeous it's such
a beautiful neutral color and I feel
like it's perfect for this time of year
they're really soft they're really
velvety again like the color pop ones
and they last all day as well when it's
are quite crap today just because I
really don't feel well but normally they
don't crack up at all so I would
definitely recommend this this shade and
a shade ecstacy are my two favorites
ectasy is more like a nudey purple but i
love that too so now at the end of my
video I really hope you enjoyed it again
I'm sorry it wasn't anything really
bubbly and really happy I was so ill
today but I have some amazing content
coming for you guys in the next weeks
I've got so many good ideas and now I'm
on Easter holiday I could film for you
so I know that you guys would be super
excited about that if you didn't see
last week's video I will link it down
below it was what beauty gurus
like in real life and other than that I
really hope you enjoy the video so I
should huge thumbs up if you did
let's see if we can smash 7,000 likes
and I'll see you next Sunday at 10 a.m.
for a brand new video I love you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
