and now you're probably thinking whoa
Anna you look different I know and
literally I don't really know what came
across me today I was planning to film a
different video and then I just thought
no you know what I really fancy just
sitting down talking to the camera like
proper old-school YouTube I literally
took my makeup off because I wanted to
do it bare face shoved my hair up put my
pajamas on and got a McDonald's I
thought it would be really fun today
just do a bit about the QA advice video
and just sit and talk to you guys whilst
having McDonald so basically it's a
McDonald's mukbang which I've wanted to
do for ages on my channel and I thought
who showed it when I thought no you know
what I'm gonna do it by myself
and also I really really fancy from all
of us today and literally like could do
everyday not even gonna lie about it so
I thought I would go out get my favorite
meal from McDonald's and sit and have a
chat with you guys so I hope you do
enjoy if you do please smash it a huge
thumbs up and other than that let's get
into the video just in case you guys are
wondering what I got from McDonald's I'm
gonna grab my drink down from here it's
on my shelf I actually just got a normal
coke cuz that's what I get every time I
going to McDonald's don't know where to
stand it though and then all my food I
got some chips because budgets five or
six chicken nuggets and then I also got
a double cheeseburger now I feel like if
you're one of those people that don't
enjoy watching somebody eat and talk at
the same time you're really not going to
like this video and this video really
isn't gonna be for you so I'm gonna
apologize but that's basically the point
of a mukbang to eat and talk so very
sorry I would try my best to be as less
annoying as humanly possible but I am
hungry so you know what I mean also
before I even get into like talking
about the questions and stuff tell me
your favorite sauce from McDonald's down
below mine is sweet and sour
so I'm with many of my friends that love
sweet curry and I'm like what are you
doing that is sweet and sour all the way
so please let me know down below what
source you'd get and when you have your
chicken nuggets what sauce should get to
go with your chicken nuggets so I asked
out on Instagram and Twitter earlier for
some topics and some advice things that
you guys want to know and I screenshot a
quite a few and I'm just gonna start off
quite light-hearted and then we'll see
beep it gets I don't really know the
first question is what's your favorite
Netflix series now I have a lot of
Netflix series I really like whether
we're talking about like Netflix
original series I don't know if we're
talking about Netflix original series
and I'd probably go for stranger things
but it was all about series that are on
Netflix in general roméo go for like
Pretty Little Liars or The Vampire
Diaries I really enjoyed the end of the
king wild I thought that was really
really good as well I'm trying to think
of some other an epic show that I've
really enjoyed this isn't a series but
the kissing booth movie I thought that
was incredible that's like one of my
favorite movies and I saw on social
media that it's actually been like March
as one of the most watched movies on
Netflix so if you haven't seen it you
definitely should go and watch it
it's got Joey King in it and she's
actually the actor from white house down
which is one of my favorite movies so
really really good film you should
definitely go watch it and what makes it
ten times better is that they're
actually dating in real life and I'm
like the native comment that somebody's
put a seal it just periods
now where's my periods like I thought
this is something I'm going to talk
about because mine I've actually got
like progressively worse and if you
watch my blog then you would know that
no I started my period not last year the
year before so how old was I I was 15
near enough 16 so I was quite late
starting I was quite lucky in that sense
and when I started I was never really
heavy like I waited a really light
period now since time has gone on my
period has got so much more heavy like
I'm literally like Niagara Falls up in
here in my vlogs loads of you said go to
the doctor so I get put on the pill
because I'm not on the pill at the
moment I'm not on any sort of like
contraceptive pill contraception
anything like that
but I feel like I should probably get
put on the pill for the pain and how
much blood I use because I do lose a lot
of blood it is very very uncomfortable
and yeah it's really really annoying so
periods are really painful my like top
tips are to just get a bath and like
massage your stomach that's what I do
and massage it in like circular motions
because it's so honestly it hurts so
much and it puts me off like doing all
the activities that I meant to be doing
like if I meant to be going out that day
I will actually be like worrying like am
i leaking through like this is so
uncomfortable I need to go to the toilet
so I thought your periods are a real
pain and one is getting progressively
worse
and the symptoms are getting
progressively worse in mine as well so I
think I'm gonna go to the doctors about
it but yeah that was
random story time the next one is going
through a heartbreak now I don't know if
I've beam it through a proper proper
heartbreak I don't want to say that I
have because I've lost people but not
like through death just through like
losing people and I feel like to a point
that caused me heartbreak when I've lost
certain people it's taken me a long time
to get over it and it puts a hole down
there on everything that I do in my day
it's all I can think about I'm a massive
over-thinker and anybody who is Friends
of me would know that I overthink
everything and its really annoying it's
something that I really don't like about
myself when I wish I didn't overthink
and when I was like going through these
situations where I was losing people
that I absolutely adored and I didn't
want to lose I would just overthink
everything and I thought I don't know I
just thought I'd happen to like a
downward spiral and the way I got myself
up out of it was through trying to think
happy thoughts and trying to look at the
positives in my life and that sounds
really cliche like I look at the
positives and all you can think about is
the negative thing that's happening but
that's genuinely what pulled me through
personally for me I thought I forgot
through heartbreak twice I say the first
time is worse than second because it
completely took over my life like I was
so so unhappy and there was like a
period of like two weeks remember what
year I was in I think I might have been
in year nine or ten where I didn't go to
school and it was in like January
February and I was so sad that I just
couldn't get myself up I couldn't pick
myself up and each day I was laying in
bed each day I got worst and I just
didn't want to get up it was weird
because like one day it just kind of
like clicked and I was fine it's very
strange like one day I wasn't and the
next day I was and I think I think that
just was because I had other people
around me that were trying to make me
happy and it's really hard because if
you lose that one person and you feel
like the only person that can make you
happy again it's that person and even
though you love so many other people
they can't help because like at the time
they're not the type they're not the
people that you want it sound really
kind of mean but I feel like a lot of
people are going to understand that
because that was personally what it felt
like for me I just wanted that person
that I lost and even though I loved
everybody else I didn't really want them
at that time but I just tried to keep
smiling keep happy through it and I
managed to get through
and I'm here and I'm absolutely fine now
so honestly like yeah just try and think
happy thoughts and think you will get
through like you always well how to get
over toxic friendships or toxic
relationships now I feel you for me I
don't think I've really had a toxic
relationship necessarily so I'm gonna
talk about toxic friendships I have had
several toxic friendships all of which
those people are no longer in my life
anymore because I just have to cut them
off and me being such a massive ever
think oh that was really hard for me and
I just didn't want I thought I'd have to
think to myself like you're gonna be
better off without them even though
right now it feels like the end all and
the be all like honesty my life is fine
I had a lot of toxic friendships where I
felt like I was the only one putting an
effort and I'm about how much cheese is
in that I felt like I was anyone putting
in effort and it was just like very
one-sided and via everything the other
person done even if they weren't meaning
to do it maliciously I would take it
maliciously because I was so like I
don't know like I just wanted everything
for them and they just didn't really
care if that makes sense
I felt like if I didn't message them
then I'd never hear from them again like
I'd never hear from them again they they
wouldn't message me and the way I got
over it was I relied and when I was
thinking relying is the wrong word I
found myself new friends I had loads of
other friends anyway but I just kind of
hung out with him tried to keep my mind
off of it and I just didn't message the
person again and I haven't spoken to
them since and that was obviously
because they didn't care and I did and
you know what that's fine and now I
think well at the time of a subset but
now I'm like why was I so upset I don't
get it toxic friendships are really
really bad because full of person that's
feeling like it it can really send them
in a downward spiral and I think I've
gone through probably like two or three
toxic friendships and honesty I remember
feeling so alone so I didn't want to do
anything and it they're very hard toxic
friend it's a horrible and I feel like
you have loads of them when you're going
through secondary school but this is
kinda like touching on another topic
like since leaving secondary school I
feel so much better
there's so much drama in secondary
school and again you think it's the end
on the B land like you fellow you're
gonna be friends with everybody that you
have been in secondary school for the
rest of your life and honestly I can
hand on my heart say I talk to no more
than
fifteen people like the hundred and
fifty people in my gear and I used to be
friends with their more people you just
see every day and you think to yourself
right no we're gonna be like friends
forever but honestly like yeah like I'll
talk to them sitting in the street but
like I'd talk to barely anybody who is
in my ear anymore I have like my solid
little friendship group and we still do
things and then I have like other
friends outside that friendship group
but honestly I barely talk to anybody
sounds kind of sad but I prefer being
alone and I prefer having my own company
rather than other people's company who
they're just kind of like use me or Joey
I just had to touch on that topic
because that was like topic that a lot
of people were asking I really like this
question it says what is one thing that
you've seen your best friends that
inspire you the most so I'm gonna do
amber and SAFF with a staff I just see
that she's so hard-working and that
inspires me to want to work hard like at
the moment and I'm filming this she's in
LA she's working hard every day to
improve our content number right that's
what I want to do like she's so
hard-working and she's so passionate
about what she does and I love that like
she honestly does this open world and it
annoys me so much like all the hate that
she gets because she really doesn't
deserve it and I know that like
sometimes people a lot of people comment
on our friendship in like our vlogs and
stuff and it's really strange because
people only see like 12 minutes 13
minutes of our day we have such an
amazing friendship off-camera which
people don't see and I'm so thankful for
her like she's one of those amazing
people I know and she works so hard and
she's so passionate and I just love her
for that and amber as well I've known
amber ever since I was in year 7
literally my first friend that I made
when I was in year 7 I look at her and
I'm like how are you doing that how have
you got that mindset like she's so
strong headed she knows what she wants
she knows where she wants to go and I'm
like I want to be more like you I love
the factor so that she's so family
orientated and that really inspires me
as well because I love my family but she
adores her family and she has doors her
friends and she don't take no from
anybody like she really doesn't and I
just love her for that I think she's an
amazing person she knows where she wants
to go in life and she's just got such a
good heart about her and like she sends
you little messages like when you need
cheering up and she's just a loveliest
person now don't like my sloppy partier
Q&amp;amp;A now I can sit anywhere chicken
nugget have you ever lost hope on your
YouTube
channel I would honesty or gotta just up
my finger in the sweet some source I
don't think I've ever like lost hope in
my youtube channel I think that's one
way of putting it
there's been times where I haven't been
inspired and I'm like oh like I don't
really know like what I'm gonna film
this week like and I just don't really
know I don't really have any fresh ideas
but I've never lost hope in it like I
never want to lose hope in YouTube it's
my favorite thing and I swear to God
even when you two dies I will still make
videos for myself to sit and watch for
myself because I love creating content
so no I've never lost hope in YouTube at
all what's your opinions about the
YouTube community and how it's changed
what's happened I've been on YouTube now
let's do my like floral princess
Anastasia clintus channel this channel
for four years and I've seen that the
YouTube community change so much now I
feel like it's a very toxic situation
and I try to stay out there I don't
really like to get involved in any drama
it's not really my place to be like I
just want to stay out of it it has
trains and I feel like now it's so
annoying but like everybody feels like
the only way to get views on YouTube now
is through clickbait and it's kind of
true and that's why I'm not gonna bother
I don't I don't really care by clickbait
like yeah you get a good title oh you've
got a good thumbnail but that is like
for most people that's the only way you
can get views and its really sad and I
just feel like the whole community is
changed and obviously we're all being a
change we're all gonna grow up we're all
gonna become different people but I just
think it's really really sad how the
community's turned out because at one
point we were all such good friends and
everybody got along so well
and I feel like yeah like I don't know
it's just a really hard situation to be
honest I just think that as well like
our viewers are changing like with like
the old like brick crew and staff or
like Zoe alfie pastor Joe etc like they
had an audience that kind of grown up
with them and I think we still have the
same audio type the newer generation of
YouTube but I thought we have a
different audience like my audience is
kind of varied I have like 12 year olds
but then I have like 20 year olds where
it's like their audience has quite a lot
older so I felt like our audiences are
changing as well which is something new
and something fresh and I think people
need to come out of the mindset of
thinking I'm gonna make this video
because it will get views I think people
need to do to be in the mindset of I'm
gonna make this video because I love
making videos and I think it's fun
that's just my opinion on it I just feel
like I wish like I personally loved
making my videos it's one of my favorite
things and I just wish people were still
like in love with making videos I feel
like some people do
for the money and it's really sad and
yeah basically that's why I pinched on
it but that's like no shade I'm not
talking about like anybody in particular
I'm just talking about like kind of the
whole scene in general and what a lot of
people think as well I do apologize if
the camera just like moved a little bit
I just had to get up and it changed my
SD card as I spoke too much on the SD
card and a space so the next question
well more topic is self-love and a lot
of the reason why I did this video
without any makeup on is because I'm
trying to improve my self love she says
as she's sitting here eating the
McDonald I used to be very very
uncomfortable in the way that I looked
and with myself like without any makeup
on because if you guys have watched my
skincare video you would know I had a
really bad skin my skin Mike I have to
admit it was awful like those pictures
in that video that putting them out on
the internet literally broke me because
I hated myself and it's so sad but I
just hated myself and there's still
parts of me now that I really like I
don't like but I've learned to love
myself because again it sounds like so
cliche but like I am Who I am I can't
change myself there's nothing I can do
about it so I have no choice but to try
and that love myself and live with it
now my skin is so much better and that's
one thing that I was really insecure
about and now like I'm absolutely fine
with going out without any makeup on or
like going on my friends if no makeup on
and I only wear makeup for fun I you I
have to admit I think I used to wear it
because I had such my skin and I was so
afraid of going to school and people see
me like it and taking us out of me and
it would just really upset me and I
really didn't want to go through that
but now I wear makeup as I was like a
creation I find that so my creativity
comes out because I'm a very creative
person I didn't like quite creative
subjects when I was doing my GCSEs and I
love art I love abstract things and like
you to be very creative I love editing
and doing thumbnails and taking photos
and I'm just that type of person and
makeup is a way that I can express
myself because I used to love drawing
not so much anymore I used to be really
good at it but because I haven't done it
in so long I'm just a bit like on it now
but like makeup is my way of expressing
myself so I've done like so many like
really cool makeup looks like earlier
today I'll probably get off my phone you
might not be
see it but I did this like really really
cool like rainbow I don't think I don't
know how we'll you'll be able to see it
so I might have to pop it off screen I
did like a rainbow I think for like
pride this month and like I improved my
makeup skills so much through YouTube
like I literally have learned everything
that I can do from YouTube no not
sitting here and saying like I'm a
nikkietutorials like I can do makeup no
I'm not saying that at all but I have
improved my skills so much through
watching YouTube and like youtubers
learn me so much like people don't
realize that impacts that youtubers can
have on people like I know like from me
personally from watching other youtubers
they had such an impact on my life and
right now if you go and ask like younger
children like also I use your favorite
celebrity they won't say like a
mainstream like anus celebrity they'll
say oh no I watch YouTube where if you
say let watch your favorite TV show
they'll be like oh I watch YouTube
though YouTube has such a massive impact
on everybody anyway I'm going right with
well off topic on some of our self-love
basically I've just learned to live with
myself and it was hard it was very hard
to do because they're still like I said
parts of me that I don't like and I'm
sure I'll watch this video back and I'll
be like I don't like how this looks I
don't like how that looks but it's life
and I'm me there's nothing I can do
about it I'm happy in my own skin now
I'm saying I'm happy when skin I am
happy but like I said there's always
gonna be a little bit but then that's
the same for everybody like I don't know
I think that Selena Gomez is beautiful I
think that nearly we're in heart is like
stunning but there's so many people I
think I like so beautiful but then
they've got insecurities as well like
everybody has insecurities it's
completely normal and I felt this also
leads on to the topic of like Instagram
as well like people tend to look at
people's Instagram pages and they're
like oh my god their life is perfect
when Instagram and kind of I say YouTube
kind of but I'd say YouTube's not have
much it's like their perfect life like
that's the good side of their life like
I don't think anybody's gonna post a
picture of them screaming crying in
tears but people pop pose like the best
parts of their life so I felt like
that's another reason why people don't
love themselves probably as much as they
should because they see these false
Instagram lives that people are creating
and they think wow like there's people
looking about this out there
like this I feel like that's what I in
my vlogs I try to show my life as much
as possible and my normal life like
literally last week in my vlogs our hot
water broke we had a hot water for the
week we were like getting boiler man
after boiler men out like we thought we
were gonna get evicted from my house
like there was so much that went on and
I just literally like blogged it I'm
like I'm not gonna hide it if I tell you
guys and down I'm not gonna hide it I'm
not gonna try and sugarcoat my life to
make it look amazing
I live an amazing life I'm very grateful
for the life that I live but I'm not
gonna try and sugarcoat it to make it
look like I know what Kylie Jenner's
life is like IRA but then her life for
me isn't perfect artist it's just a
circle Johnny and the last topic that
I'm gonna talk about is love Ireland
because realistically is there a mukbang
without talking about love Ireland I
don't know I am obsessive love Ireland
and I'm filming this like a week before
it's gonna go live so when you guys see
this obviously there would have been
like six seven more episodes out so I'm
really sorry I'm saying something and
then like something changed I feel so
sorry for Alex my heart that she goes
out to him he's the nicest guy and he's
just so lovely and I think it just goes
to show what girls go for nowadays and
it's so sad like Adam is such an idiot
like I can't believe Megan didn't pick
here and basically I just feel really
sorry for Alex and I do talk about love
on every day in my vlogs anyway so I'm
not gonna like touch on it loads but I
do love Haley I think she's so funny
like she comes out with some really
random comments and I'm just like where
did you even get that from now mind you
talking about brexit and he said does
that mean we're not gonna have any trees
I was like what like that confuse me so
it was like where did you get that from
that's basically my opinion I love
Ireland I love it this year I think it's
really good and I think it's getting
better so if you do want to see like me
talk about it in detail then you can go
over to my build channel that's what I'm
going to touch on in this video but I
hope you guys have enjoyed it they send
McDonnells mukbang
to be honest I've kind of forgotten what
I've spoken about I've been speaking for
a good like 40 minutes so I've kind of
forgotten what I've been speaking about
but I have eaten all my food and I'm
feeling pretty good about it because you
know this day so you just like need a
MacDonald you just like need some
comfort food like your dog is my
favorite food hands down so thank you so
much for watching I really hope you guys
have enjoyed I just wanted to do a bit
more of a sit-down like talk to you guys
video on this Wednesday I've got a
really good mentor video come out Sunday
which I think you guys are going to rely
I'm trying really hard with my content
the moment I'm feeling really inspired I
think that's as well because of the
people around me but I'm like I feel
like a lot of people aren't loving you
at the moment but I'm like loving it
like I'm so excited to create the videos
that I'm going to create and like when
you guys are watching this I'm going to
LA on Sunday which is so exciting so
yeah but I'm just like I'm very excited
so hope you guys have enjoyed if you did
