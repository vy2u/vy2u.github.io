back and I'm going to be doing my
morning routine expectations vs. reality
I literally feel like I haven't sat down
here for ages because I prove filmed a
ton of videos whilst I was revising for
my GCSEs and literally I have my first
exam on Monday but I've taken a few
hours out to film this video if you guys
and it feels so good to be back in front
of the camera but Kroy I feel my
happiest and today our new filming
another skip video which you guys have
really really requested so without
further ado I'm just going to get
straight on into the video I really hope
you enjoy it and let's get stuff the
first expectations vs. reality scene I
guess is waking up in the morning and
you think you're going to have like a
really nice wake up you're going to have
plenty of time versus all way you've
woke up really late and you have looks
you like - to get ready
hop now more in bed
c18 it
Oh the next expectations versus reality
is breakfast now you think you're going
to have this really cute breakfast that
you see people post on Instagram on
snapchat and it's all healthy and then
in reality you just have a really busy
breakfast that you don't even have time
to eat because you have to hurry up and
get ready or in some cases you don't
even get to eat
breakfast is so cute today little ticks
off track cute story
oh okay I don't even have time to eat
breakfast anymore
next one is makeup now this one is very
you know in the morning you can either
have a really good makeup day or you can
have a shocking makeup day where you
literally have two minutes to do your
whole face in which you shove concealer
do a bit of stuff in your eyebrows put
lipstick on bit of highlighter you're
done but then if you have those really
nice days where you have like half an
hour's to your makeup your makeup and
look Bom
you
you
next one is choosing outfits now also
this can either go really good or really
bad most days this goes bad for me even
though I have so many nice clothes to
choose from I just think all we're going
to have no clothes but you're either
going to have that really cute Instagram
outfit or you're going to go with the
tracksuit the messy kind of top of
stains down it just because you can't
really be bothered and you've lost all
hope I think I have the perfect outfit
I'm not too sure but since color quante
in my wardrobe I'm pretty sure I'm gonna
be able to find something that's so
pretty I got it
I have nothing to wear guess wets and
jumpers and leggings is again finally to
end off the perfect morning routine you
either go out you have the best time and
you got with your friends and take those
two photos and have a really good day
or you get canceled on and you end up
going back to bed I'm super pumped to go
off all my friends today I cannot wait
let's take a selfie for snapchat before
we go out ah the butterfly fit was back
my favorite yay okay let's go
hey obviously checking my phone about to
leave what's up you can't go anymore
why oh you'd rather go out with Becca
well no I just woke up late brush my
makeup brush my hair brush my outfit
didn't eat breakfast and now plans a
canceled anyway so I might as well come
up bed have a good day
never
at the end on my video I really hope you
enjoyed it if you did give it a huge
thumbs up let's see if we can smash
10,000 lights because 100% there's
10,000 of you watching this video so
going on there and give this video a
huge thumbs up yeah I love you all so
much
and I'll see you soon for a brand new
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
