prefer it when they don't have the car

looks really oversized as well yeah but
they may look a bit oversized yeah no
yeah I prefer the motors I wouldn't want
it tight oh yeah I do like that she
loosened jeans yeah I think that's
really pretty
I've got the jumper on I do actually
really like it like to be fair the only
thing me and mum will just say was
obviously when I wear makeup and stuff
it will go round the collar because I
was the old foundation looks really like
orange on white but other than that I
actually really really like this I
probably like rolling up the sleeves
yeah because it seems really nice I
can't do it but yeah I do notice
actually looks really nice to be honest
it's a really nice fit so I like that
one
what you wrote it out ten about ten for
casual wear yeah okay sure we're okay
this is the last thing so this must be
almost as if you get the trousers go
into town oh that's so nice yeah no I
realize that it's like a roll but it's
not like a full-on turtleneck it's like
a crop that's not it it's a bit like a
gray perfectly color I like that a lot
what is a wrong net longs for you so I
shall grow yeah I like that would you
put that and this is what
yeah yeah put it there I've got the crop
top on I do actually really like this
okay this is probably one of my favorite
yeah out of all of them just because it
fits really nicely I like that yeah the
color is really different it's what I
couldn't lie nappy gray which I like
maybe put like brown tones I really like
it and then obviously this neck is well
it's not like really tight it's really
like this and you could not roll it over
as many times as you want so honestly
this is probably my favorite clothing
item that you bought me yeah I like this
a lot I really like that I love this top
I love the top what I'm written it's
just it's really like the tops your
favorite thing the shoes hands out no
close my eyes I close my probably the
darling jumper yeah I like the gray boy
suit but I need to see what it looks
like yeah maybe one of those things that
are really weird on but I like the
sweatshirt I like this you have actually
done really well with the things that

actually would probably choose myself so
