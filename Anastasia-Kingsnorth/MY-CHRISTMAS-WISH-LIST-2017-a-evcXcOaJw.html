going to be doing my Christmas wish list
for 2017 now what I mean wish this these
are the things that I would love to
receive for Christmas I by no mean think
I'm gonna get all of them because
obviously I'm giving like options and
everything like that so these are just
general things that I would really like
and obviously this also helps you guys
out because you might want them as well
and it's also kind of like a gift guide
in a way I've got my little winters
jumper on I've got a red lip I'm feeling
it and yeah I'm just really excited to
this video because these are so my
favorite Christmas videos to film and
the fact that we're now in December and
we're on like day three I think it is of
Advan just so exciting I really hope you
guys enjoyed this video if you do please
give it a huge thumbs up let's see if we
can smash 10,000 likes just a Christmas
videos because Christmas is amazing and
yeah let's just go straight into it in
my household we kind of do like you get
a maine present and then you get like
little things to go with it so there's
two options of what I would really like
for a Maine present this year I think I
know which one I'm probably going to end
up getting just because one of them is
just so hard to get and it's just not
really practical one thing I would
really like is a new phone I would love
the iPhone X because my phone has
started to do this thing where it will
freeze on the homescreen and then I have
to hold down all the buttons to get it
to restart and it started to do it like
noon once everyday so it's just like
basically breaking and breaking I only
had it for a year and I feel like when
they come out with a new iPhone that's
when everybody else's phone start to
break it's like they flip a switch so
everybody has to go and buy a new phone
I would love the iPhone X but obviously
it's like over a thousand how to buy
outright and that's just not practical
at all so obviously getting it on
contract to be an option so I would love
that if possible but that's yeah that's
kind of like one of my main presence I
would really like the other main person
that I really would like if I don't get
that is a Gucci belt now I've wanted one
of these for so long I was gonna get off
my birthday but then obviously my mum to
party with the purse I basically want
the black one and it's got the two G's
on it and it's so beautiful I think it's
about 240 pounds but I never wear belts
and I really want to and that is one
that I would look
where with everything but the only thing
is none of my jeans have belt holes
which means I would literally have to go
to tar shop and buy about four new pairs
of jeans which are costing like a
hundred and sixty pounds just so I can
wear a belt so again not practical as I
would like hygiene you just don't have
that looks actually wherever I don't
want to do but my top top ones don't I
am obsessed with the Gucci belt I think
it's so beautiful
there's loads of Instagram accounts that
do like outfit with the Gucci belt and
it's just like jeans with tucks in
jumpers and like it's just amazing
everything about it is amazing moving on
to the other things I would love to get
for Christmas it there's actually quite
a few little things but again I'm not
expecting all of these these are
literally just as ideas
I love tangle teezer so much but I just
don't have one anymore I don't know
where it went
honestly I'll age you just lost it I
somehow keep losing my hair brushes and
I'm lost I think three hair brushes out
which is honestly ridiculous because I'm
like where on earth are they going but I
keep losing them and I don't know what
to do I really loved the rose gold
compact Tangle Teezer I love that I love
the ones with the handles as well so it
delete any tangle teezer I would be
absolutely over than mean with because
my hair is really thick he gets really
naughty so that would be perfect for my
hair next thing I would love is
something from Bath and Body Works bath
or Body Works Christmas ranges are
incredible you don't even get me started
on how amazing they are the candles are
next level and the twisted peppermint
one is so fresh the hot cocoa one is
just so cozy
I just know all the names even though
did I bother body wax in the UK I know
the names they are about like 20 pounds
off of the bath and body shop but oh my
gosh
this is literally at Christmas time and
often time that's when I wish we had a
bath and Bodyworks in the summer I can
get through but it's the cosy months
that I really wish we had one I'd really
love a bath and Bodyworks candle or
anything from Bath and Body Works I used
to be obsessed with the hand sanitizers
was anybody else obsessed because I know
I was I'm really getting into my
perfumes recently and I've got the Gucci
bloom up there which my dad got me my
birthday and I loved it so much I really
want to try the washy you know fresh
Couture perfume
it's basically pink and it comes in a
little like a spray bottle but it's not
it looks like a cleaning detergent
bottle but then you take
often it's a spray but it's so beechwood
so unique and it is such a fresh scent
you can get it in loads of different
gift sets or you can get it on its own
but obviously I love the bottle but I
love this scent more like I said I'm
just really getting into my perfumes I'm
never used to like wearing perfume I
just I love what I like the smell of
them but I just always forgot to put
them on I just put my spray or something
else but now I'm addicted to my perfume
so that's definitely one for the
wishlist of course what would a
Christmas wish this feat without lush on
it I love lush to pieces it's just lush
basically it's so good these Snow Fairy
scent is 10 out of 10 love that one and
I love the comforter even though that's
not a Christmas scent I'm trying to
think back to the other Christmas ones
I've got this year eggnog scent that
they do is it bath ball I can't think of
it but it's so good as well oh and candy
mountain candy mountain is an absolute
classic so basically any lush I would
love I'd love to get a gift set the oh
my gosh what's it called
Christmas candy box I've talked about it
in my Christmas gift guys love that one
I think it's about 20 pounds and you get
full products in it but it's so
beautiful and they're literally the full
products that I would buy separately if
I was in love something that I really
really want even though I have so many
matte lip colors so please don't kill me
I really want the Too Faced limited
edition Gingerbread liquid lipstick and
it's basically well what do you think of
Gingerbread you think of like brown
because obviously gingerbread is brown
and it's basically the perfect brown
liquid lipstick you guys know a nude is
my favorite color to wear on my lips but
this one's more it's genuinely Brown
like normally the news have an undertone
but this one is so Brown it's so
beautiful it's 19 pounds and the lid has
gingerbreadmen on it
and I'm literally obsessed it's so
Christmassy obviously it's only going to
be available to Christmas because it's
called gingerbread house Christmas
packaging so I would love that for
Christmas I'm not gonna write that's
like really high on my Christmas list
another thing which I've wanted for so
long but I can never find it so I'm just
like cute so um see if she can find it
it's the morphe 35o palette they used to
sell it on beautybay but they sell the
OS which is the shimmers i don't get
along with shimmer eyeshadows that well
I get along with matte eyeshadows so I
really want the 35o but it's basically a
palette that is filled with oranges and
browns and nude eyeshadows it's amazing
I think you can
tre shadows maybe you get even more than
that I think it might be 30 or 32 but
they're about 20 pounds a lonely best
pallets ever I love more your eyeshadows
actually got them all - today I'll link
the tutorial down below but yeah I love
morphe 35o it's definitely the next time
that I would love for 20 pounds of 32
eyeshadows that's less than a pound per
eye shadow I can't do maths that quick
that's less than a pound another thing I
would love into a brand called tart and
obviously I'm guessing you guys know
tart it's amazing but they don't sell it
in the UK you have to ship it over but I
really want the tart is it heartiest Pro
contour kit you get three contour shades
and three highlight shade and it's just
the most beautiful palette I've ever
seen that has it and every time I still
use it on like beautiful it's like this
sleek black matte packaging and then
it's got gold writing and then all the
insight is like foil gold the
highlighters are so pigmented and some
of the contour shades it's amazing you
can get it in three different shades I'd
probably go for the light shade because
as you guys can see I'm literally like
pale as a ghost 24/7 so definitely the
light shade but it's so beautiful I'm
pretty sure about 36 pounds which fatah
because if it's a high-end brand it's
really good I would also love to try
some of their rainforest of the sea of
skincare like range everything like that
because it looks amazing again the staff
has it she used it and she loves it
I trust that opinion so I would really
really like to try some of that as well
another thing I would love are some new
earphones because I use earphones 24/7
right because I have an iPhone 7
obviously they go in the jack like this
so I just use the ones that came with
the phone but I need some that fit in my
laptop and ski dip do the most gorgeous
headphones I want to go over you can get
earphones we're going straight in your
ear but I love the ones that go over
your head
these are so beautiful and they're
glittery and then they're just a thin
gold band and you can get them off see
from skinny dip or you can get them from
Urban Outfitters and they're so
beautiful
and I would absolutely love a pair of
them I think I just said there are 30
pound
although in my brain some realize what
my brain did not remember saying it I'm
gonna say it again but there's about 30
pounds but I love skinny dip stuff and
my phone case is from skinny dip i
lapped okay to some skinny dip
I know parts of him skinny dip he's just
such an amazing brand the last thing
that
absolutely love this Christmas is
something that's actually discontinued
I'm pretty sure or if it's not yet it is
being discontinued and it's a huge
Beauty rose gold palette how gorgeous is
this palette I mean the golden dust
I wouldn't necessarily get because I
think it's very similar to cuz I have
now but the rose gold palette looks so
beautiful with the glitter shades and
the matte shades the red shade I love it
so much I'm a sucker for eyeshadows and
like I said I want the morphe palette I
really love that palette other than over
there the morphe palette is 20 pounds
and the Hyuna Beauty one is about 60
pounds so don't know if I'll be getting
it but I really really like it plus I
love the packaging I think it's some of
the best eyeshadow packaging or ever
seen with the clear see-through front I
just think that's so sophisticated a
little bit but yes that is basically my
Christmas wish list for this year I
really hope you guys enjoyed it just
some items I would really love to
receive and obviously given you guys
ideas for things that you could buy
people or ask for yourself but yeah
other than that I really hope you guys
enjoyed this video if you didn't
remember to give it a huge thumbs up
let's see if we can stash 12,000 likes I
know you can do that there's twelve
thousand of you out there and then that
I really hope you guys enjoy it and I
will see you soon for a brand new video
