different video but basically it's
currently
GTC without staying it's just gone eight
o'clock I can get my results at nine
o'clock so me and my friend and our
parents are all gonna walk to school I'm
gonna get my result and I'm gonna tell
you guys what I got this is a
nerve-wracking day I don't know hope I
have my results I am I am buzzing
romário that was like they're not the
best that you're gonna see on youtube
like by far but I am so happy with them
because I worked as hard as I could I
tried my best
I'm really annoyed about one of them
because I tried so hard and I did not
get the result I wanted at all and I
actually didn't pass it but we found out
that it's more than what you want
because check-in what my marks against a
great boundaries it doesn't make sense
with what's happened so we're paying to
get that remark so fingers crossed that
will change Benny I'm just gonna go
through my results because I never say
watching this video so my first one on
the sheet is maths and I got a 6 which
is the equivalent to a high B so I am
ecstatic because I hate math I was gonna
fail it in English language I also got a
B which I thought I was going to get a 7
which I'm a little annoyed at I've got a
6 but you know I'm not gonna complain I
particle B in English literature I've
got an 8 to achieve an a star and that's
my first ever a star like I've always
wanted an a star in the fixture and I
finally got it so I'm happy with that
in biology I did a triple science so in
biology I've got a B which I'm very
happy with in chemistry I've got a B
which again I'm also really happy with
and physics I got a B so I got B's all
across in science it's because I really
did mess up the threes or I couldn't do
them at all I probably would have got
AIDS
if I did that on the threes but no mind
in Ari I've got a B which again I'm
happy with because I always got B's I
could never get an A for some reason so
I'm happy with the big then for my three
chosen subjects in art and design which
is fine art I got an a star which I am
so happy with because I found it so hard
to get like all the work done and it's
up so much to it so to come with a name
style I'm so happy in history which I
still cannot believe I got an A style I
got a star nearly full marks on all
three of the papers or two the payments
and the call
twork so how I do not know but yeah I
got astray stars so I'm so happy about
that now this is the result I'm really
annoyed in I took DT textiles and I got
a D now my coursework was an a-star and
somehow I got a date when I know for a
fact I did not fail the exam so we're
trying to sort that out we're trying to
get that remark but I'm a bit annoyed
about that so ignoring that result I've
got three a stars and six B's so to me
I'm happy to I mean like I pass every
bin I'm not taking any of these subjects
on a level one starting completely new
things so I'm very happy that's what
I've got my GCSE results I hope you
enjoyed this video let me know if you
took your duties either what you
got down below and yeah that is
basically it I really hope you enjoyed
and I'll see you on Sunday at 10 a.m.
for a brand new video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
