wee bit of a different hairstyle and
yeah I'm gonna be doing a how I
transformed my hair into this blond kind
of balayage ombre look and haircare
routine I have wanted my hair like this
for the longest time this is originally
what I wanted when I dyed my hair back
in june/july time didn't really work out
and I'm gonna explain the story of what
happened with photos of my original hair
they're the kind of mid-step between how
it faded out and how I eventually got to
this then I'm going to be giving you
guys a haircare routine so yes that's
very exciting as you guys are why the
hair care routine for the longest time I
really hope you guys enjoyed this video
give it a huge thumbs up if you do and
let's just get into the video now back
at the start of summer I really wanted a
change I was kind of getting bored of my
old hair I started off with a color
pretty close to this they're saying this
is my natural hair color now this is
apparently what my natural hair color is
although I do not remember myself being
this dark but I'll put photos on screen
that I can find where you can see my
hair and its color at best I don't think
it was originally this dark I feel like
it just looks darker against the blonde
but yeah apparently I had this dark hair
was a very dark dirty blonde but it
basically was brown I was just very
bored of it I wanted something new I
wanted to try something else so I
thought I would buy a box dye and amber
did it for me it was a ombre kid I loved
it I was so excited for it to happen
when amber did it it looked so nice I
really liked it again and then the next
day when I woke up it kind of turned a
bit yellow and I think it was just
because I didn't bleach my hair my hair
was quite dark and it obviously just
didn't take to my hair very well but
amber skills were amazing at doing it so
thank you so much amber even though the
color didn't work out I loved your
skills of doing here it just wasn't
exactly what I wanted it to be it didn't
the color didn't look like it said it
weren't on the box and the color just
wasn't what I wanted
it looks very yellow whereas I want it
to be a bit more white this still looks
a bit yellow on camera
I promise you in real life it's like a
nearly white ish blonde then when I woke
up obviously and it got a bit yellow my
hair wasn't in that great of a condition
again I just think my hair didn't really
take to the box color very well I was
like okay I'm gonna have to go to the
hairdresser's and I showed them a
picture of the ombre wanted just my
natural hair color down to a light white
blond basically just a normal ombre so I
showed that to the hairdresser and
basically what I got wasn't exactly what
I wanted I kind of got this weird
mixture of yellow blonde brown
highlights everything was just I don't
know like I didn't have a forehead she
went her forehead on me and I'm not sure
why but I wanted a forehead and it
basically just had a straight line of
color going all on the back of my head
with my roots still coming through Brown
but then she kind of put random streaks
of blonde in all up here and it looks
okay like everybody said they really
liked my hair but I didn't like it and
eventually it turned very yellow it was
just not what I wanted so I was like
okay you know what I'm gonna go back to
the hairdresser's I'm going to say look
it's faded out a bit now it's gone
yellow can you just completely strip the
color from my hair back to my natural
hair color and then do an ombre the
weird thing is I actually used to be a
pure blonde my hair was as bitchy as it
could be and then actually turned brown
which is so sad I love brown hair
obviously for habit but I love my like
completely Beach blonde hair because I
used to go abroad quite a bit when I was
like a lot lot littler it was like beef
blonde but yeah now it's just kind of
gone back to like a blondie dirty color
so then we come up to this I went to the
hairdresser's I gave her the picture
that I wanted I was like can you just do
this and it worked perfectly it was
exactly what I wanted exactly how I
wanted it I was so happy because finally
after 5 or 6 months of waiting I
actually really liked what I was just
bored of it and I just wanted it to be
like a few colors and you can see it's
kind of got like the fade on it and yeah
it just looks
and it's a lot more me so right now I'm
gonna put in a new vlog clips of me this
morning and going it to get my hair done
right now I have just finished getting
and ready
I have straightened all my hair probably
didn't even need to because obviously
I'm going to the hairdresser's now but
this is what it looks like before I get
it dyed like I said I don't know how
well the dye is going to take to it or
what comb is gonna end up looking like
because apparently they don't have much
time at the hairdresser's to be able to
do it and obviously my hair is a bit of
a dodgy color anyway so to try and get a
complete ombre over this don't know if
it's gonna work but this is what I have
so far it's really long but my hair is
it really long to be fair but yeah I'm
excited because I just don't like my
hair anymore it's just like really
yellow and this line is starting to come
back again and I just really don't like
it so fingers crossed they'll be able to
work their magic right now I will put on
screen some pictures off my hair from
like behind from the sides and stuff so
you guys can see what it actually looks
like but yeah finally so excited to be
getting it redone because I had it dyed
in July beginning of July so July August
September October November it's in five
months so good five months it's growing
out quite a bit but yes so excited to
get it redone it's gonna be so weird
because I'm going to get a little bit of
it cut off as well so yeah but you guys
can probably see now because I'm showing
it better like the line that there is
and I just don't really want that line
there anymore and I just want it to be a
bit more like a whitish blonde so that's
all it kind of looks like sorry it's a
bit like kinky because my hair is so
long I actually can't straighten it all
properly let's go to the hairdresser's
here is he finishing product I love it
so much like I said it's exactly what I
wanted so you guys are very intrigued as
to what I use to keep my hair in good
condition while it wasn't exactly the
color that I wanted so I'm going to show
you the products that I used starting
off with shampoo and conditioner these
were amazing it honestly kept my hair a
whitish blonde and kept it in good
condition for at least four or five
months and these are the john frieda
sheer blonde brilliantly brighter
shampoos and conditioners I got this I
would say around three months in and
honestly it done wonders for my hair I
think I'm in about seven pounds of
bottle so you know it wasn't like the
cheapest shampoo conditioner but I
really liked it it really does well for
me and these bottles are actually nearly
empty now it's an ultra illuminating
shampoo so it just really illuminates
the color that I had which was good
because a lot of it was blonde too it
just made it look brighter but then I
had a lot of roots coming through which
I'll put the picture on screen now and
they were my natural hair color and that
just kind of illuminates it to be almost
black so these are a lot lot better for
blonde hair obviously because it's sheer
blonde but yeah I use the stem for a
hair mask I use the John Frieda
sheer blonde high-impact and I use this
so much it's really good I put this on
for about three to four minutes once a
week and it just again because I was
gonna bleached my hair it gone a really
weighed consistency it just made it
smooth and silky again which was really
nice again I think this is about eight
or nine pounds and you can pick it up
from boots or wherever your fancy really
somewhere like that then when my hair
was really in need of some TLC and it
was just like literally in a dire
condition I use this and this is the red
Ken diamond oil glow dry gloss scrub so
there's quite a bit left at this deal
because you really don't need that much
I only used this maybe three or four
times because it lasts so long and this
just gives your hair the shine that it
was missing and it makes it really
voluminous and I just pop this in a
little bit in with my conditioner and oh
my gosh it's just amazing fresh canned
stuff is honestly so good I got this at
the NYX fire event that I went to and I
turned a redhead I was like wow I'm so
excited to try some of this stuff
because it is quite pricey but it's
honestly
amazing stuff so yes these were the kind
of treatments that I used to keep my
hair in as best as kind of a condition
that I could and now the shampoo and
conditioner I'm going to be using is
going to be a silver base one because
obviously I want to keep my hair this
shade of blonde for as long as possible
so I'm gonna be using the provoke touch
of silver so many people talk about this
I'm pretty sure you would have heard of
it they're meant to be amazing when mum
uses it because my mum owes dyed her
hair every single color you can imagine
and now she's kind of kind of like brown
- blonde ombre so she uses this as well
and it keeps it really good it just says
it's a brightening shampoo with a toning
of violet pigment and then an intensive
conditioner with a carrot in it repair
complex so hopefully this is going to be
really good I will keep you guys updated
in my vlogs of what I think but yeah
this is what I'm going to be using but
that is basically my hair journey I just
got bored of it and yes it took me a
while to get it to this but I went to an
amazing song which I will link down
below so if you guys do you want to go
there I'll put the name of my
hairdresser and everything that she done
but honestly it's amazing and I love it
so much the only thing is because it's
so dark it's gonna obviously take some
getting used to and it makes me look
really pale I'm not actually this tail
well I obviously am good it shows but I
swear I wasn't but I really hope you
guys enjoyed this video if we had it
remember to give it a huge thumbs up let
me know what you think of my hair down
below I hope you guys like it I feel so
much better I feel like it suits me a
lot better and obviously it will take
some getting used to but new look for
Christmas and kind of new look for the
new year ish even they were only in
November but it's coming I love you all
so much I really hope you enjoyed give
it a huge thumbs up if you did and I
will see you on Sunday at 10 a.m. for a
brand new video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
