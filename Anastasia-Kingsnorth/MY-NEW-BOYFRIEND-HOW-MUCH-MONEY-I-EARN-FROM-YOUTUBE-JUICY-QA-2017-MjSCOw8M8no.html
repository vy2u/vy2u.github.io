back and I'm gonna be doing a juicy Q&amp;amp;A
so ever since I've been on YouTube a
Cuban is something that I haven't really
been interested in doing or I just
haven't really liked watching them but
so many of you are asking me questions
that I thought you know what for this
week as I've had marks and I've had a
really busy week I'm just gonna ask you
guys for some questions but I asked for
them to be quite deep questions I
literally anything you guys wanted to
know about me and I'm going to answer
them there are certain things that I
have only shared on social media
platforms such as Instagram that you
guys may not have seen if you don't
follow me over there there are certain
things that I haven't told you at all
before and I'm going to tell you them
today just because I feel like I want to
grow our relationship between youtuber
and viewer closer because I absolutely
adore you guys so much and this week we
hit 250,000 subscribers and I literally
sat and cried when it happened because I
cannot believe that there's a quarter of
a million of you out there now and it
just amazes me so thank you so so much
but yeah but that further adieu I'm just
going to get into the Q&amp;amp;A and yeah I
hope you enjoyed so the first question
is asked by Emily and she says have you
ever done something said something or
sent something to a youtuber that you
regret I most definitely have I am too
embarrassed to sit here and tell the
story just because it's finally blown
over and me and the people on staff
person are okay now but I've definitely
said some things that I really regret
I'm not saying they're bad things just
things that I wish I never said because
it could have made it awkward or I just
feel like we drifted after I said it or
the situation happened and I know that's
really vague but yeah there definitely
has been some things I've said took
really close friends of mine that I've
filmed with and I've been read each
other's houses and like it's sad but
it's happened and I can't do anything
about it now but yeah there definitely
has been things that I regret but
everything's okay now and me and the
person are absolutely fine
so yeah the next question is asked by
Morgan and she says do you smoke now
smoking is something that has never
interested me it's something that I
don't want to do because my mum smokes
and I she doesn't want me to but like I
don't want to hurt
that makes sense and it's just not
something that I find attractive in
people and it's just not something that
I want to do but obviously I am a
secondhand smoke if you guys know what
that is because my parent does smoke I
like get it's Tammy sometimes I can
smell it so I am a secondhand smoke up
but there's nothing I can do about that
sadly but I'm not smoking no I would
never like cigarette myself and have it
I just I don't know I wouldn't feel
clean after I'd done it it's just not I
want to do I'm not putting people down
if you do smoke at all but it's just
something that I wouldn't do the next
question is are you seeing anyone / are
you in a relationship now I think this
is the most popular question on my
Twitter feed literally when I asked on
the hashtag
our floral princess this is the one that
was appearing right at the top because
so many of you guys want to know so if
you follow my Instagram you possibly
would have seen that I went live with a
boy who's actually just my friend and we
went live on Instagram and we were just
joking around and loads of people
thought that we were in a relationship
and that we were together we are not we
are just friends and that is literally
our we're going to be really just
friends but yeah I'm not in a
relationship I'm not seeing anybody I am
just riding solo but yeah I think that
confused a lot of you guys so I'm very
very sorry about that
but yeah we are just friends so yeah
that's it I'm not seeing anybody if I
was seeing somebody
I would definitely let you guys know and
if I was in a relationship as well I
would show you guys like because I want
to be proud of the person that I'm with
and I want to show them off you guys
because like I'm proud to be with them
so when I am in a relationship if I ever
get in one then of course I will
properly show you the person if you have
to would you pick YouTube over a
relationship I love you I love you too
and I don't know at the moment I'm not
in a relationship so yeah I would pick
YouTube over it because YouTube is my
absolute world and I would love you to
be my job therefore I can't really
imagine me picking a relationship over
YouTube just because I love it so much
and it's my life and you guys are
absolutely incredible so no I would pick
YouTube over a relationship most
definitely
the next question is asked by broke and
she says are you still a virgin
yes I'm still a virgin I am sixteen
years old some people find that hard to
believe some people think I'm older but
I am sixteen so I am legal but I haven't
had sex I'm still a virgin and
be honest it's something that doesn't
really interest me as much as it might
others it's just something that I'm not
like super super excited to do like it
just it doesn't really bother me so I'm
peers some people are like oh you should
be ashamed that you're a virgin I'm not
at all I'm a virgin and I'm quite proud
of it to be honest it doesn't bother me
that I'm still a virgin so yeah I
haven't had sex how many relationships
have you had I love you and I love you
too so I have had two relationships they
were a long time ago I haven't had a
relationship for a good few years and
that's just because I haven't found the
right person I think I'm only 16 I've
got my whole life ahead of me but these
years are really important to me and if
I'm going to spend them if somebody I
want to make sure that I'm spending it
with the right person so now I've had
two relationships in my past but they
were a long time ago so I don't even
know if you'd count them as a proper
proper relationship because I was like
what between the ages of 10 and 13 but
yes and no I haven't had a relationship
in a long time okay the next question is
asked by Naomi and she says snog marry
avoid Jake Mitchell Spencer which is Umi
films and grayson dolan so I would marry
Spencer just because I love Spence it's
a bit so we have such good friends and
he's always there for me and we just
talk all the time and it's so nice so I
would marry Spencer I would kiss great
and Dolan because who wouldn't grayson
dolan and i would most definitely kill
Jake Mitchell I'm pretty sure you guys
know why I don't have to explain it but
yeah I would kill Jake Jesse asked
hashtag asshole princess ever had beef
with a youtuber love you I love you too
yes I have had been for the youtuber if
you guys follow on Twitter you might
have seen some of the beef that has
happened and sometimes a lot of things
happen behind the camera actually the
lot of you guys don't see youtubers can
be very different off the camera and
some of them are very rude some of them
are very malicious I'm not going to say
names but I have wiped those people out
my life I do not talk to them anymore
I just don't want to associate myself
with them but yes I have had beef beef
with youtubers before it's not something
that I'm proud of because I hate getting
into drama now but yeah have been and
done that what is your most embarrassing
period story so I don't really have an
embarrassing period story in all honesty
because if I mean complete girls with
you guys I haven't
my period for as long as some of you
guys may think I don't like to talk
about it a lot because it was something
that was really concerning and was
really worrying for me but yeah I'd
haven't had my period for that that long
so I don't really have an embarrassing
period story but I can tell you guys how
I started
so me and amber was sitting on my bed
and as my best friend if you guys don't
know and I had shorts on and she just
kind of like always he Gaunt's down was
like oh my god honey you're like really
red and I was like I got away and I
looked down and I was just sitting in a
pile of blood that is how I started my
period I was having the worst day ever
that was literally the worst day of my
life and just to top it off I then came
on my period oh my god what did I do to
deserve such a good day and the last
question is how much money do you earn
from YouTube now this is a question that
a lot of you guys also ask and I find it
very interesting because youtubers never
tell how much they earn to their
subscribers it's not something that I
particularly want to share either just
because I don't want to get judged I
don't want to get use I guess for how
much money I have but money is not the
reason I do YouTube I will explain to
you how the money system works so you
don't get paid for likes or comments you
get paid the amount of views you get on
your channel and you can get that from
Google Adsense and basically they'll
take a percentage of it but they will
basically add up all of your monthly
views that you've had in that month and
pay the amount of money for it now when
I started YouTube I had no absolute idea
that this works that you could get money
from it I didn't get start I just start
getting paid until maybe 60 70 thousand
subscribers I think like literally I was
absolutely clueless but money is not a
motivator for me it's not something that
I do YouTube for ie I really do not care
how much money I have I do have a lot
for my age and I'm so so grateful that I
have that and I can have it to grow up
with and to use on things I really like
to buy and to help my family we me and
my family went through a really hard
time and I was really fortunate enough
to have enough money to help my mum
through and some people may be ashamed
but I'm really proud of that that I can
help my family out because it's
something that I've always wanted to do
and it's kind of giving back and I may
only be 16 but I'm proud of it but yeah
that is basically every single question
that came up most often I really hope
enjoy this video I had mocked all this
week for my GCSE so I really haven't had
much time but I hope this was good
enough anyway because I know you guys
have some questions that you really
wanted to ask if you want to be involved
in my next Q&amp;amp;A made sure to follow my
twitter or instagram they'll be linked
down below because that's where I get
all my questions off of you guys but
yeah other than that I love you all so
so so much thank you again for a quarter
of million thousand subscribers I can't
believe it and yeah I love you all so
much I don't see you next week for a
brand new video bye
