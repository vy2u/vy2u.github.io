another video today I am going to be
doing a bit ever sit down chatty talk to
you guys because you know what I thought
I haven't done that in ages I'm not
gonna be doing a lot of videos that are
kind of like close related and makeup
related and today I just felt like
having a sit-down and having a chat all
right up between my Twitter and my
Instagram which will be on the screen
and down below if you do want to give me
a cheeky follow and I asked you guys to
send in questions about basically
anything you wanted to know things that
you want advice on I said I'm doing a
bit of girl talk boy talk and basically
just having a chat with you and
revealing secrets having you some
stories that's what I'm doing so I hope
you guys enjoy it if you do remember to
start a huge thumbs up and other than
that let's just get started
in my notes I've wrote down the most
common questions so that I can answer
them for you guys the first one is did
you always want to be youtuber and if
not what did you want to be so I always
wanted to be on YouTube I know I always
wanted to be youtuber I always wanted to
go into the mainstream media like
presenting acting all of that type of
stuff I used to do a lot of it when I
was younger and then I just stopped
doing it when I was younger I used to
love dancing I did street dancer did
ballet I did contemporary I did know
different types of dance and I went to
like acting schools for weeks and stuff
like that like I loved it so much and
then just kind of stopped I think
confidence just kind of got the better
of me and I know I was going to go in
the mainstream media that is what I want
to do now but there was always another
career path that I always wanted to go
down and I know I never will be able to
but I always wanted to work with mi5 and
mi6 and I always wanted to become a
secret agent I thought most people say
that just because they want to be like
oh I want to know what this person's
doing
and the joke like oh I want to watch
people through their webcams like like
no I actually wanted to be a secret
agent I wanted to help the country up on
a bigger scale or become a secret agent
like it's something like I always wanted
to do and I've read so much into it and
I've done so much research and it's just
not gonna be possible for me like I
don't think it's going to be possible
anyway that is my other career path that
I would have liked to have gone down
hypothetically if I ever got the chance
to other than that no I've always wanted
to be a youtuber and going into the
mainstream media I want to have a
massive interest in like NASA and the
White House and everything like that so
I would have loved to have gone into
something very sciency or very political
the next question is so many people
asked and I'm just gonna clear it up and
it says did you go on a date with Jordan
Huston the obviously you probably have
seen the video Jordan it pranked me and
because we've spoken quite a lot I said
yes I was like yes surely I will go on a
date whatever but he was pranking me and
he was bringing the Pleader to ask
anybody to go on a date but it obviously
was made up I just said yes but no we
haven't been on a date no we're not
dating we're not boyfriend and
girlfriend we do talk because we aren't
like good friends and stuff but no we're
not dating
there's no hashtag to Anastasia whatever
you guys ship us as we are really good
friends and I do really love him in a
friend because he's so funny and we are
very similar I'm really sorry
I'm just gonna shut down the dating
rumors now we didn't go on a date most
people seem to think we did go on a date
but we didn't the next question is how
did you intercept from me and I get
again I get so many people asking this
question so basically I commented on one
of saffron's at first videos if I could
find the comment open it on screen now
and I just basically said like I love
this video like we should definitely
talk or something like that she applied
to me and then we started dealing on
Instagram and we gave it to the like s4s
back in the day and stuff like that
she came to my house in April it was
like April 17th she came to my house it
was 17 2016 from that day onwards that's
how we met it's coming up to our like
two year friendship marker wrong we've
met it will be on April the 17th 2018
it'll be two years so that is how move
stuff on me I always get loads of
questions but that's how we met the next
question is do you regret starting
YouTube because of hate or any other
reason and Sony you will ask me this and
I will never ever regret starting
YouTube because it's something that has
changed me as a person it shaped me as a
person and it changed my life but that
has been certain times not because of
hate because I just don't give in to
hate I know that it says more about the
person giving it in the person receiving
it but there has been certain times and
certain circumstances where I have
thought to myself like things would have
been so different I've had people turn
on me
who I never thought would turn on me and
I've had people do things that I never
thought they could do because I was on
YouTube and it was people that I never
could imagine that would do that to me
so no I would never regret starting
YouTube because it's the best thing that
ever happened to me
but at the same time I regret some of
the things that I've had to give up
because of it and some of the
relationships that I've lost because of
it but then at the same time I love it
so much so it's such a how question but
no I definitely don't regret it
another question I always get asked is
what is your family situation so
basically I live with my mum I'm a
little brother Atticus Atticus is for
this April it's a basically long story
short I don't know my real dad I've
never met him then my stepdad who's
called it Steve is who I call dad like I
don't call him my stepdad was calling my
dad I grew up with him when I was like 1
2 when I was maybe like 9 and then that
said my mum and dad split up they got a
divorce a few years later my mom moved
out I'm still seeing my dad I always get
questions about my dad but I still see
my dad I still see him a fair bit I just
don't put him in my vlog during like my
social media and then about five years
ago my mom got pregnant with Atticus her
boyfriend at the time but she's no
longer with him so if that made sense
that's my family situation so I just
lived with my mother and brother but I
still see my dad Aska still sees his dad
those people like you don't have to
watch if you don't want but I don't mind
because it's not that joy me like it's
not that complicated it's now it's
complicated it's not what country do you
want to travel the most to now this is
such a hard question because there's so
many places that I really want to go to
the two top places at the moment are New
York and LA so basically America I went
to Florida in 2016 and I adored it like
the best trip ever I really want to
travel to New York first and then I want
to go into LA I really want to go to a
hot country because I used to go to I be
through a lot when I was little but I
haven't really been on a holiday that I
can remember bye my little like bikinis
for remember Bryan holiday clothes for
so I really want to go to a hot country
I really want to travel to Thailand
because I think that looks amazing I
think you look so beautiful
me and I think my friends are looking at
going to Budapest because we really like
the look of that and I don't really know
so we're gonna go to Rome there's a lot
of places I want to go to you I really
want to just travel I also really want
to go to the Maldives and barley I think
they look absolutely incredible
obviously they're so expensive but one
day I know that I will get to go to them
the next question is what is your
relationship status and do you have a
boyfriend I always get Arthur's question
no I am so single it couldn't be more
single and I don't have a boyfriend I've
never actually had a proper boyfriend
I'm 17 which you know what people are
like oh you were only 17 is fine I'm
like I know I'm only 17
I haven't had a proper boyfriend I've
spoken to people and we've been like
together but not like said we're
together but no I've never had an actual
boyfriend so I'm single I'm I look for
somebody you know I always have like
little crashes and stuff when I do have
a crush on people I'm saying on people
I'm like well I'm a few people you know
you're like oh like you're really
good-looking but then it's not there's
like a few people that I have around and
stuff but I just like let it happen
actually I don't have the confidence to
like message them and be like yo like I
like you I can't do that oh I don't know
yes so basically I am single I do have a
few people that I've got like a little
bit of a soft spot for all right and
very much alone and I'm okay with that
because I'm a really independent person
I think I'd actually really struggle
giving not giving it up because I
wouldn't be giving it up but sharing a
massive part of my life especially with
how busy I am but at the same time I do
really want it so I don't know so it's a
really hard thing but no I'm single
what was your first kiss like I had my
first kiss in year for you 3 or 4 but it
wasn't look at kids it was actually a
snog like 9 10 year old Anna went in it
was with a boy who I don't really know
anymore or like I've spoken to him
occasionally and he does live in my town
Ivan I can't even much of what it was
like it was on my trampoline and my mum
and dad I was having a cigarette I think
like my dad shouting around my mum like
Anna what you don't know like nothing
and I was like just tell my first kids
so that's what it was at my house when
he came around for dinner one night and
I don't know we were like we were really
close so I'm saying I have another
boyfriend actually he's a boyfriend at
the time bitch you know I mean like it
wasn't like a serious it was more like a
nine ten year old relationship so yeah
that was basically my first kiss which
was very very interesting I have had
like boyfriends and stuff but they were
just like well really
if you can count it what was a horrific
period story they've gotten how to deal
with cramps so oh my god I I cannot even
tell you guys I have now got the worst
period I never had bad periods like I
started two years ago and I never got
pain with it I never really had much
blood through there I was very very
lucky recently in the past few months
I've just gotten so heavy and it hurts
me so so much that I actually get stuck
in bed because it hurts me that much I
literally am like just coming off now
like I don't really mind talking about
I'm just coming off now and I was in bed
the whole weekend because I was in so
much pain like I was with my friends on
the Friday night and I'm constantly it
was time to go to the toilet because I
so much pain with it like and I take
painkillers for it's like everything for
our hot-water bottle but I get the worst
cramps in my life
lower abdomen is that you say it abdomen
let's just go the word tummy and my legs
and the way I deal with them is I have a
hot chocolate because I read that that
can help I have a hot water bottle I put
my legs like up so my knees are like
here and that also helps and I get a hot
bath but I can always feel the pain
there like it's always it's so annoying
and I know when my periods are coming
because I get the pain for like a week
on end but you know what we only get the
12 times a year I can cope with it and
I'm so happy I'm coming off it just
really hurts the first time I started my
period I was with Amber and I had the
worst day like amber can tell you I was
just having such a bad day and we came
home from where we were and I sat on my
bed and we were just having a chat and I
had my pajama shorts on and amber
obviously just glanced and she saw that
there was a massive red patch under me
and she just went Anna there's a massive
red patch and a bernoulli started a
period and I just looked down and I was
sat in a pool of blood like my period so
you know obviously the hormones that
Dave's I was very upset
gommi another question that I always get
asked is are you still friends with the
Paris squad so not last year the year
before I went to Paris with other guys
and I come how many of us there were but
there was me Lewis
jazz so Kaitlin Molly Hannah and Eve so
there's eight of us who went and who
their parents as well so it was eight of
us and yeah I also friended them I think
it's just because I don't really see
them anymore that I don't really like
put them on my social media because I
just don't get to see them like I saw
Molly and Eve recently I've seen Louis
all the time I see dad quite a lot I
don't really see Hanna that much I saw
her a few weeks ago in our management
office but other than that I haven't
seen Kaitlyn in ages I have a thing so
yes also a few minutes ago so like I've
seen them all the time I just don't
really put them on social media because
it's not like we are together for long
we read together like 5-10 minutes at a
time so we just have like a really quick
catch-up I think they've all just kind
of like separated off and like Paris was
like keeping us together as a friendship
group and then after that we all kind of
went off to separate friends and
separate like groups and stuff so yes we
asked a little friends we just like
don't really talk as a group anymore
well I don't anyway I also got asked on
behind for I would be about toxic
friendships so I honestly feel you on
that because there's a lot of times I
wondered to myself like have I being a
toxic friendship like I know I have and
like what do I do to get out of it how
do I resolve it and honestly it's so
upsetting because it often happens that
you relies so heavily on a person and
you could never treat them how they
treat you so it comes such a shock to
your system when they're like that to
you and when they start spending less
time with you and when they just start
ignoring you and they don't want to talk
to you like it's horrible and I've been
through it and I think the best way to
deal with it is to realize that it's not
you and you probably haven't done
anything wrong it's just them it's just
them being stupid they're just growing
up and honestly it's their loss if they
leave you behind because as people who
are I have no longer got in my life who
moved on and you know what I'm sorry I'm
I'm sorry like it was their loss when
you've got a group of girls that are
very like kind of like you know I don't
want to swear but bit gee then you know
like he's really hard because I feel
like a lot of the time I when I was in
secondary school I thought it was like
the be-all and the end-all like if the
popular group didn't like me or I had an
argument with my friend and like
honestly since leaving I've realized
that it's not the be-all and the end-all
and when you're in secondary school you
kind of late you have labels and it's
really sad that you've got the pop you
know you've got the geeks you've got the
kind of middle people you've got the
people who know
wants to talk to and you label yourself
and it's so unfair and it shouldn't be
like that and that is a lot of the time
what causes toxic friendships it
shouldn't be like that and since leaving
I know that honesty it gets better
I pride it gets better does a person ask
how do you deal with boys not liking you
back now go I feel you this has
literally been me in the majority of
situations I always end up falling
really hard for somebody because the
problem is like I fall quite quickly
like and quite deeply as well like
actually really deeply really quickly
and half the time the feelings just
aren't in return so it's really hard to
kind of like build yourself back up and
I get yourself out of it and honestly
again you just have to realize that it's
their loss and it's their fault not
yours if you fall for somebody and they
don't fall for you you have to remember
that it's not personal and I honestly do
believe that when you meet the right
person you'll both feel exactly the same
for each other and the thing is if they
don't like you back then they just want
the person for you that's what I've
honestly realized and now I could safely
say I am completely free on over
everybody that I've ever spoken to and I
feel so good about like honestly like
not I want to say a few months ago go
for quite a few months ago I was in such
a bad place I like honestly like I used
to hurt me so much if somebody didn't
like me back now I've realized that it's
not me I just haven't met the right
person yet if they aren't that for you
that I truly believe that everything
happens for a reason and it will be
meant to be and you'll be together but
if not don't worry about it because
you're young and there's plenty of fish
in the sea you always think there's
plenty of fish in the sea and like those
people say that but their honesty is
that you've got so many opportunities to
meet new people so don't let one person
out of billions on this earth ruin your
day because it's not worth it the last
topic a lot of people were saying what I
they wanted me to talk about was a lack
of motivation and on this I 100%
completely feel you I struggle so much
with motivation because I work from home
I do my online courses from home
majority of the time my job is pretty
much a home like my job is YouTube so
I'm constantly in this little tiny room
and it's really hard sometimes to get
motivated because you can love what
you're doing but being in the same
surroundings every day and just
repeating over and over you can lose
motivation sometimes the best way I'd
like to deal with it is getting up and
grabbing out I don't mean going to spend
those of money and going on a shopping
trip or anything like that I mean going
for a walk trying to go and do your work
somewhere else like in a Starbucks or in
like a dolls I did I love McDonald's
that's why I said it getting up and
going out and trying something new like
try and go out with your friends try and
just get yourself out and don't let
yourself get down have a massive pamper
bar that freshen yourself up so fill up
and you've got a lack of motivation it
can also lead to like a lack of hygiene
and you don't want to wash yourself you
don't want to do specific things and
it's just a vicious circle I see the
only advice I have for that is just to
get up get out of bed and tell yourself
that it's a bad day and not a bad life
so that is the end of this video I
really hope you guys have enjoyed I hope
it's give me a bit more of an insight or
some of the questions that you wanted to
know and I hope my voice has helped you
a little bit I like to see it as I'm
kind of like a family member helping you
out or a friend helping you out and even
though I don't know you all personally I
feel like you can really listen to me
and understand me
but I love you all so so much thank you
so much for watching I also uploaded
another video on Wednesday where I
reacted to my old videos if you do want
to see that I will leave a link on
screen and down below is so funny I
reacted to like 7 years worth of videos
of myself on YouTube which most of you
probably haven't seen so go watch that
if you haven't but I love you all so
much and I will see you on Wednesday at
6 p.m. a favor on your video and overall
my vlog channel porcelain vlogs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
