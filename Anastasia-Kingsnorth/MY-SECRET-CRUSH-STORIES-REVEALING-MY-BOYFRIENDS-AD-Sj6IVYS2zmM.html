video I am back and I am going to be
doing reacting it to my ex crushes and
boyfriend advice I am so excited for
this video because this is something
that I don't usually do but I've always
wanted to do and I feel like you guys
are gonna absolutely love this find a
little bit more about me Edition the
dirt on it my exes where I say exes my
ex crushes cuz it never works out I am
doing this video in partnership with
Disney Channel for the launch of a
brand-new show and emac which is
launching on a September 8th at 5 p.m.
in the first episode and they have a
life-changing secret that is going to be
revealed and she's very modern she's
very relatable and relevant to today's
society the show actually looks
incredible it's so relatable and so
relevant to today's unreal like honestly
come on you've had a crush I've had a
crush everybody has crush it is I think
you guys will love the show I am super
excited to watch it so I thought I would
do a video today talking about my
crushes in relation to Andy Mac so you
guys can get to know a bit more about me
before you go and watch the show this
show is very different to normal Disney
Channel shows as it's set on location
and personally I am really excited for
it I love Disney Channel I've always
been a huge Disney kid so I'm very
excited but yeah without further ado I'm
just gonna get straight on into the
video and tell you guys a little bit
about my crush it is what I'm gonna
start way back it I'm gonna say yeah for
it might not been your fault it might
have been your 5 but I'm pretty sure it
was year 4 I had a crush a big crush and
the boy knew it too and I think it's
very important to clarify that I am
actually still friends with this boy now
and if he watches this video he's gonna
know that it's him so this boy who I am
gonna give a fake name I'm gonna call
him I'm gonna call this boy Alfie okay
that was nice name my crush Alfie I
adored this kid absolutely adored him I
would do things for you sitting staring
class and all of the classic girl things
that I would do I did I adored him and I
just thought he was the most
beautiful kid ever and I had a big crush
my heart like every day I would write
like me my best friend at the time would
write like I love this person and
they're like second name and it was so
cute what's not so cute is I am going to
show you some of the conversations that
we had which I found on my social medias
from 2011 and 2010 within this there was
also another person who I went out with
he was actually my first boyfriend I
think he's my first boyfriend yeah my
father second boyfriend and I also
really liked this kid and he dumped me
after like two weeks and I remember is
like a heartbroken my little heart was
broken and he is also in this chat so
the first person is called Alfie and
this person can be called Tom so we've
got Alfie and Tom I loved Alfie tweezers
he was my big crush but I never went out
with him but I went out with Tom and
apparently according to this I've really
liked him too I heard a picture and it
says I love you and one of my friends
commented I have a boyfriend
Thanks and I put no offense but I have
my eye on somebody who has a girlfriend
long and this boy that I really liked
it was the boy he commented who are you
keeping an eye on who has a girlfriend
Anna but can we just appreciate how we
put my not a ye a keeper I only has a
girlfriend Anna and I replied you what I
replied you I literally just told my
social media I told my friends that I
had a crush on this kid and I was very
very open and proud of it and then he
said go on chat Anna so my 11 year old
heart you know I was 10 at the time
probably was bursting for you so that
was one of the conversations I think the
very important thing to clarify is he
actually went out with my best friend at
the time my heart yeah I was really sad
so I got you like if you go if you've
gone through this I've caught you
the next one is there was obviously a
little bit of drama and tension and my
boyfriend boyfriend at the time so the
Tom person commented because Alfie hate
said I went out with her met doctor so I
know
and then I commented back yeah Tom you
did dunk me
but it was your loss weren't it so get
lost
my 10 year old heart was fuming and then
I commented two years later ha reading
back no ha read him back at that is so
awkward I was so happy at the die and
then I always like to express my like
love for this person that I was going
out with who so like Tom and I used on
December the 18th 2010 I put which I was
with Tom need a hug sad face and he
applied me too and then on December 19th
I put an edge king swot is waiting for
Tom to come online kiss love you kiss
and he also replied me too as you can
see I will has so much luck with my
crashes you know what I mean they just
went my way today
all right the thing is I've saved the
best one until last out I cringed when I
saw their December 17 2010 at 9:34 p.m.
I should have been in bed I was like
baby baby baby no like baby baby baby oh
like baby baby baby no I thought you'd
always be mine no I love you Tom
and he commented I love even more he
didn't even put you so I didn't even get
and I love you back that is the story of
my crushes and then one of them moved
schools and one of them came to my
secondary school with me go back to
Alfea I love this kid so much that
throwing back to all times I used to
play like online games and stuff and my
password to the online games was I love
then the person's name I was obsessed
and that's what we do as teenagers we
get silly because we get very happy and
excited that we've had a crush and I'm
sure that's what Andy Mack is exactly
like as well she just gets very happy
very excited it's a big thing having a
crush like it's an exciting thing but I
also now have grown up I am sixteen
nearly 17 years old
and I've learned a lot about how to do
with it and boyfriend
I said anything like that so I thought I
would help you guys out and give you a
little bit of boyfriend advice I thought
I would give you some tips on how you
can maybe get your crush to like you
back or how you can kind of get their
attention because it's an exciting thing
you want them to like you back so I'm
going to give you some my tips and
hopefully how you can maybe get them to
like you back if they don't already and
I mean you are lucky if they do I have
never been in that situation the first
one is basically just be positive when
they're around and be happy let them
know that you're a really happy person
that you're interested maybe crack a few
jokes and if you're feeling confident
enough and make sure to be like
communicate with them and talk to them
that's really important as well because
if you're in communication then you can
maybe like each other a bit more they
can like you back and it can be great my
next tip is to always be yourself as
well because if you're not yourself then
you could fall into the trap of somebody
liking you except it's not the real you
and then you kind of have your bit
trapped or a bit in trouble always being
around the person just laugh make jokes
and then they can see the real you and
they can like the real you
I thought that's a really important tip
to always be yourself and to not be
somebody else around them because
sometimes it's very common if you like a
person but they like another person you
try to act like the person they like in
order to get their attention don't do
that
just be yourself and fingers crossed
that will work something really
important is trying to get their
attention as well so maybe if you're
just seeing them in the coroners at
school is kind of like brush past them
and give them like a nice little smile
or accident' you just be like all sorry
even though you did just walk into them
on purpose pretend it was an accident do
silly things like that that will get
their attention but will hopefully make
them laugh and that will get them to
notice you and be like ah okay okay but
then it's also very important not to be
too out there and to over with them
because if you're 24/7 around them
constantly trying to get their attention
they're gonna find it may be a little
bit weird so give them this space don't
act up too much you know play it cool
I know it's hard when you have a crush
I've been there play it cool
something else you could also do is drop
them a message on social media that way
it kind of
that you were thinking about them and
that you wanted to measure them and he
wanted to talk to them you would also
find out some of that interest and may
you see if they interest you as well
because you never know you could you
could like art they could like art and
you could both go and paint a picture
personally for me I have never really
been very lucky with crushes I've always
tried my best it just never seems to
work out for me but you know what it
will work out one day I have faith I
know it will hopefully sometime soon I
know it's coming but that is the end of
today's video I really hope you enjoyed
it I love filming this video it was so
funny just to look back at some of those
comments of what I was doing like me now
looks back and think why why but then I
know you know what I was happy back then
and it's funny to look back on I'm
actually speechless make sure to watch
the brand-new first episode of Andy Mac
on a September 8 at 5:00 p.m. on Disney
Channel I will be at 5 p.m. watching it

she's such a relatable teen and I think
you guys will love it but yeah other
than that I really hope you enjoyed the
video if you did give it a huge thumbs
up let me know down below some of your
crushes like things that you've done
