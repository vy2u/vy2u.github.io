going to be doing a beauty and makeup
haul so I'm so excited to do this video
just like every other haul because let's
be honest whores are an amazing video to
watch it's give you so many ideas and I
just love letting you know what I have
picked up recently just to help you or
just in case you're really intrigued but
this is also a collab video with my best
friend amber I'm gonna link her video
and her channel down below she is so
close to 10,000 subscribers and you've
got so many videos lined up for you
honestly she's been filming so much of
summer holidays I've just I'm so happy
for her so make sure you go and check my
channel out again I will link it down
below and make sure you guys set up a
video too because that'll make me very
happy so without further ado let's get
into the video so I'm gonna start off
with my drugstore pieces because I never
fit drugstore it's always pretty helpful
I love walking in there and just picking
up some new bits so I recently picked up
the Barry M sunset
daylight curing nail polishes so I
picked up the topcoat which you need and
then I picked up 509 like a nude and
this is the most gorgeous color ever so
these range at $4.99 each but I got them
for 2 for 7 pounds so can you tell
bargain yep 3 pounds off I just love
these so much and they have a rose gold
lid so they're gonna look fab on my
shelf I also posted a really nice
Instagram picture of these and I love it
by the way instagrams in the description
box down below self promote but I
absolutely love these I just oh my god
they're so gorgeous I have the color on
my nails right now and they do not ship
at all and they're basically meant to
make your nails look like you've gone to
the style and got them done that's
basically the main purpose of them so if
you want to sell your nails but you
don't really want to go to the salon
these are for you I then also picked up
some bits from L'Oreal because mean I'm
a little bit of L'Oreal it's very very
nice so every went in there just like go
for it so I picked up the L'Oreal Paris
infallible 24 hour matte foundation I
wanted this for so so long for some
reason I've just never picked it up I've
seriously don't know why oh my god I
also have you I have it in my hand right
now so it is basically a foundation in a
tube basics and stay
but it's really really good it is a
medium texture with a high coverage and
a matte finish and it has shine
controlled in it which is something I
definitely need especially for my t-zone
because that can be quite shockingly
shiny so the thing I like about this is
that it's in a tube so you can squeeze
up exactly how much you want like if you
have a pump
sometimes it come up with more than you
want especially like the Mac concealer
that comes out with so much so I
absolutely love this and I've got the
shade 11 vanilla if any of you are
wondering because 10 porcelain looked
very very light and a bit too light for
me so it was actually on three for two
so mean amber would just like you know
what let's just go for this week or two
so I also picked up the L'Oreal Paris
color riche JLo's nude lipstick and you
guys know how much I love these
lipsticks if you've watched all of my
other halls I wrote about them all so
much
this is my third one but I would give
them 11 out of 10 for the packaging the
consistency the pigmentation the texture
how long lasting they are everything is
just way over ten out of ten because
they're just amazing the $6.99 and I
know that so he goes on about the Rimmel
Kate Moss lipsticks well I'm basically
doing that but with these because they
are just amazing and I love them so much
so honestly if you're looking for a
really good lipstick and you have around
7 power to spend go for this I also
picked up a L'Oreal Paris and the blush
in the rose in the Rose and what in the
shade sandalwood pink because it was
actually sweet for two and I didn't
really have anything but I wanted for
free like so I had my heart set on
getting so I just kind of had a look
around and like picked up what I liked
and this is why I got off a free and it
is the most gorgeous blush ever
it's basically a dupe for the elf
twinkle pink blush and it is a very much
a lighter version of sleek rose gold as
well like it is the most gorgeous blush
they're so pigmented as well because I
just watched it in the shop me and I
were just like whoa okay we had to get
it so this is $6.99 by going for free
because of three for two but honestly if
you're looking for a perfect blusher
especially for school go for this one
because it's beautiful then the last
thing I got from the drugstore was a new
tank
teaser as I desperately needed a new
tangle teezer so I just got the pastel
pink and purple one because when I
filmed my summer hairstyles video which
I'll link down below my brush got a bit
ruined because of the colors I put in my
hair so yeah I'd have to buy a new brush
but I don't mind because pastel colors
for the win and this was at 1099 from
boots but tangle teezer literally the
best brushes ever so if you don't have
one I would definitely recommend getting
one of these so I actually believe that
that is all of my drugstore things I
have I haven't really gone and picked up
so much in the drugstore recently I've
actually for once gone on a bit of a
high-end spree which is very unlike me
so the first thing I have from high-end
is from Too Faced and it's the Too Faced
better than sex mascara so if you
haven't tried this guys you definitely
need to because it is the most amazing
mascara ever number one the packaging is
so good like you can definitely tell
this is an expensive made packaging like
it's so heavy as well for mascara
especially the wand part which shows
it's really good really good we made
nice English that it's made really
really good and it's a fiber one it's
not a plastic applicator so you can just
sweep it up and it will leave your
lashes looking really really natural and
it's sort so nice it's 19 pounds but
definitely worth it if you have a bit
more to spend on a mascara and you
really feel like going for the long
luscious lashes next I went to Mac so me
so I should were coming home from the
Isle of Wight
if you don't know Saverio link her
channel down below as well but we were
kind of home from the Isle of Wight and
we got us a pack crossing London and
there was a huge MAC store and we kind
of went on a little bit of a shopping
spree in there I think it's a report
like 5 lipsticks so yeah so the first
thing I picked up was the Mac sharp now
because I've recently be getting into my
lip liners and I really really needed a
sharpener because I always have to
borrow my mum's and if I'm doesn't have
one well then I'm screwed so this was
only four pounds so I decided to pick it
up because most sharpeners range from 3
to 4 so if I'm gonna get one I might as
well just get one from Mac but it will
fit any eye shadow pencil in other than
the big thick eyeshadow pencils so I say
after the pencils I meant lip liners but
yeah it's absolutely amazing
and I love this so much you can actually
even use it for school probably probably
wouldn't want to but because I then
decided to go to the eyeshadow bit and
pick up some eyeshadows for school so
the first thing was I picked up the pro
color to compact so it just looks like
this and oh gosh and he dropped it and
it's just this little cute compact where
you can fit two eyeshadows in and it's
just magnetic and I thought this would
be perfect for school because I really
needed some school eyeshadows because I
don't know anywhere I said to school but
I thought I couldn't right now I have
this and of course I needed to buy some
items to go in it so I just picked up
two so the first one I picked up is a
map one and it is called orb and the
woman in the shop recommended this to me
her name was Laura
shoutout to Lawrence and Pine Crest so
it is basically like a skin shade
eyeshadow so it would just leave my
Isaac in all one color
no like you've been shown to or anything
I'm just gonna put this all over my lids
and this was ten pounds I then have the
twinkle pink twinkle pink what am I on
about sweet less eyeshadow and I love
this so much
it's basically a pastel pink shade and
this is going to look so so nice on my
crease at school as well so I cannot
wait to put those in my little palette
finally I then also picked up a matte
lipstick because all my bad guys how can
you go to map without picking up a
lipstick so I got the shade blankety and
this is just a amplified finish so it is
basically when it looks like velvet
teddy but it's nothing like they would
tell you when you put it on your lips it
is basically it actually comes out pink
like a pinky brown shiny type color it's
so so pretty and it was fifteen fifty
but matte lipsticks are amazing I now
have ten and I'm so lucky to have ten
but I got it I'll see you love them so
that was all of the makeup and beauty
things I picked up in this haul it
wasn't like loads but it didn't come to
quite a bit of money so yeah I just
wanted to show you really so I really
hope you enjoyed the video let me know
