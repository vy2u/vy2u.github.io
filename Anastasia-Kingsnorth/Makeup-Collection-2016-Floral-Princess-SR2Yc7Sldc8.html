going to be doing my makeup collection
2016 so this is my first video in the
new year so happy new year is now 2016
which is in Seine I don't know where the
time is going I'm literally 16 this year
which is like blowing my mind so I
thought the perfect video to start off
the year would be a makeup collection
because this is sooo many requested I
think I did my last one around August
time maybe it was quite a long time ago
I will link it down below if you do want
to go see my old one but my makeup
collection has changed a lot since then
because I've recycled a lot of my makeup
to my mum and my nan because I just
wasn't using it and I knew that they
would get better use out of it than me
so I've kind of got new products and
I've got rid of products so my own
collection is just how I want it it's
perfect to me I have just the right
amount I need and I absolutely love it
