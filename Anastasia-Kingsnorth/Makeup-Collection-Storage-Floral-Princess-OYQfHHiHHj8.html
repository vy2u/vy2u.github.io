going to be doing at my updated makeup
collection for spring 2015 so I am doing
this video because I cannot believe it
but I have hit 50,000 subscribers on my
youtube channel and I am literally in
shock
like when I started YouTube I never ever
imagined that I would get 50,000
subscribers and now that I have if it
was so surreal to me like I literally
cannot believe it and as a big thank you
I wanted to do one of the most requested
videos on my channel and that is an
updated makeup collection so I'm going
to start off in my vanity type area
because I've never really showed this
part of my room before in a makeup
collection but I thought I would because
as I said I never have but I just wanted
to quickly say that I'm not trying to
brag or boast in any way shape or form I
literally just want to show you how I
keep my vanity and there was my hand and
