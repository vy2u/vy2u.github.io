to doing a another huge makeup haul I
know that I've done another one recently
where I did a giveaway in and I wanted
to do another one because the gilroy
went down really really well so I wanted
to do another giveaway because you guys
love them I love giving back to you
because all you've done is what my
videos and you've given me so much so I
always want to give back and I've also
accumulated a load of other stuff that I
would like to show you so yeah that's
basically what I'm going to do today as
it stays with the end for a giveaway as
well but make sure you watch the video
first and do not skip ahead please see
ya I'm just going to get straight into
the hole I hope you enjoy it let's get
started the first two things I have
often bury em and I just kind of went
into Superdrug done my usual little
barium nail shop for the spring and
picked up two nail polishes so the first
one I picked up it's a little bit of a
darker shade and to be fair it's not
very spring-like but I just really
really liked it and it is called dark
side of the shroom and it's one of the
sunset daylight hearing colors if you
don't know what these are they're
basically meant to look like gel or
shellac nails I think that's how you say
it sure like shack
I don't know they're meant to look like
those and I think they do because I
don't really like to get my nails done
that often why I've never got them done
if I bar nails I just buy them from like
when I can just stick them on because I
don't really want to ruin my nails
because I'd like to keep them in good
condition and I don't not paint at the
moment but yeah I really like these and
I don't actually use the topcoat with
these that you're meant to get I don't
think it's very good I think you can use
these perfectly on their own or with a
different top coat so yeah this is just
like a line lucky color and they're
really opaque you literally only need
one coat I only really use like three
bands of nail polish I use very m-miss
40 and I see they're already opaque
polishes and yes I love it I then picked
up a new one actually and this is called
birthday Stephen is a mini mask and it
says
camouflage color and condition your
nails so as I said this is in birthday
suit and on the back it just says it's a
treatment for nails it strengthens and
conditions damaged nails and conceals
with a semi matte colour finish
so I thought this would be really nice
as it's just a nude pinky color and
those are my favorite type of colors to
wear my nails because they're not too
noticeable especially for school but
they're just really light and pretty to
have and this almost 399 and this one
was $4.99 normally them on 3 for 2 when
I went obviously there weren't but yeah
it get on TV too because then you get
one free buy then picked up some things
online from boots because my local food
doesn't actually have a NICs counter but
I picked up three of the NYX lingerie
lipsticks so I see these all over
Instagram and all over Twitter and
everybody post pictures of them with
their MAC lipstick with their carnage
and the lip kits and I actually haven't
got a Kylie Jenner lip kit I haven't
managed to get one yet I'm just really
really slow and I never like to wait up
until midnight to get them because I
just like to sleep but I really do want
one but I will see you the shipping is
quite expensive and I think they total
at about 30 pounds whereas these
lipsticks were six times fifty each and
they are just as good they have 24
colors to choose from so I picked out
the three nudie colors is there the
colors already like at the moment so the
first one I picked out with lace detail
I then got pushup and bedtime flirt
bedtime flat is the perfect nude color
for me it's got a little bit of a pink
undertone and it's just everybody's
perfect nude color I feel and then the
next one I got was pushup and this is a
bit more of a brownie nude it's a little
bit lighter than a bedtime flat but it's
still really really gorgeous and I'll
probably say this it's my favorite three
maybe and I know always them so much and
then I also picked up lace detail which
is actually quite light and if you
accomplished on Google it doesn't really
look that flattering but I really really
want to do it and it looked so much
better I have it on right now and I
don't think it looks like to tour I
think it looks really really nice and I
thought it would look nice if I done
this one let it dry and then put it in
the middle a bit like an ombre lip and I
thought that it really cute so I'm gonna
try that sometime but these are only six
pounds fifty and I'm so happy that boots
are now stopping them because this means
I can get the whole collection
eventually and I think this cost week
this cost me like nineteen pounds fifty
for these three whereas obviously
immaculate 615 for one and then a
cottage oh that gets 30 pounds for one
so these are a really good bargain and I
would definitely definitely recommend
they're so pigmented and not drying it
so I'll consider in their map and then
have a load of stuff from benefit
because I recently went to the first
launch of good ship benefit which is the
ship they have in front of the London
Eye on the River Thames it's so gorgeous
the attention to detail is crazy and I
didn't actually vlog because I'm not
very good at vlogging in public but I
was with Gabi
Robert go-to did vlog and I was in a her
vlog if you want to go watch that and I
also think Molly from Beauty spectrum
blogged and knew from online knew as
well so if they did a load their vlog I
will link it down below if they didn't
I'll just link their channels but it was
so so good and I had such a good evening
and we got to see a few of the new
products and there was just loads of
people there and it was a really really
amazing evening
so they actually gave me a few bits and
they sent me out some things in the post
as well from their new collection that I
wanted to show you
so they actually sent me a huge box and
it was a huge Hoonah box like it was
amazing and I don't know any of the
hooda stuffs I was so so happy so the
first thing they sent me it was the hula
bronzer and this is insane I'm not just
I'm not saying any of this because they
sent me it because I don't even have to
show it they just sent me it because I
was a blogger that I don't have to show
anything but obviously it's benefit not
a love benefit so it's just a matte
bronzer and it's so gorgeous I've wanted
it for a long long time so when I found
that they sent me this I was so shocked
on bitch I've screamed really pigmented
I have it on today I'm not very good at
contouring and like bronzing and
everything so yeah but it's a really
really good bronzer and I really would
recommend this if you're looking for a
high-end one and it got some of their
new who a time which they've added on to
like the hoola bronzer so the first one
is the hoola
zero tanlines and this is for your body
and it is basically a body bronzer so it
lasts 12 hours I haven't actually tried
this yet because I'm not one of the
people who would like fake tan or like
you know I'd never have done that but I
really want to try this so I'm
definitely gonna try it it looks like
this and it's so course it's just like a
huge tube and like that and it smells
really good as well and it just got a
little shots light it's got like a
slight shimmer to it which I really like
and then you take out the bottom it has
a sponge it just looks like a human
skirt really like a woman I don't know I
really really like it
it ranges it I think is 19 pound 50 but
it is really good I try it on the back
of my hand and I wore it to the hula
party so who your party what I'm about
could she benefit it was so good and I
really would recommend this I haven't
put it all on my body yet I just put it
like on my arms and stuff but yeah I
would get back to when I put it all over
my body though they sent me their other
new products and this is called jus the
hula and this is a soft matte liquid
bronzer so this is basically who love
but it is liquid and the packaging is
amazing it's basically like a bamboo
stick and it's just a liquid bronzer and
it says do the hoola by benefit and just
come to this little pump here it's so
pigmented and it's quite dark as well
but I like it because it's really easy
to blend out and I've never used a
coupon so before so I was very very
cautious when using this but it is so so
good and this was like a little bit of
shimmer on top looks so nice and I think
this is 22 pounds 52 by but it's amazing
and I really really really would
recommend it and I'm not just saying
that because I got sent it I genuinely
liked it because as I said I'm not the
person to like contour like I wouldn't
probably have gone and bought these
photo shoots because I'm not very good
at that
but now I've tried these and I've got
the graphs of using them I'm definitely
gonna go start buying like more bronzers
and everything like that
the final thing they sent me it was the
hoola bronzing and contouring brush they
actually pull out a brush I believe this
is their first brush they bought out on
their own I'm not too sure though so
don't hold me to that but yeah that's
again is a bamboo stick and it's so so
fluffy I used it today
so nice Oh what am i doing it's just so
soft I could like sit here all day just
like we put across my face it is 17
power but if you're looking for a really
good brush as soon as the super soft
definitely go for this one
so I now want to do a giveaway for you
as I really love doing do the waves and
these type of videos they are my
favorite videos to do giveaways in so I
asked on Twitter what you guys would
prefer to see in a giveaway and I'm
gonna check the polls right now because
I said would you prefer Jun the hoola or
NYX lingerie lipsticks and at the moment
it is 53 at 47 percent which i think is
too close so I was like you know what
I'm just going to give away both so
you'll be winning a jeweler hoola from
benefit and you'll also be winning a NYX
lingerie lipstick I'm going to let you
choose the shade of this though because
I don't want to buy shades that you
wouldn't like and the wouldn't suit your
skin tone so I'm gonna let you choose
the shade but this just comes in one
shade so you've got this I thought it
would be nice to do another giveaway so

everything like that go down below but
