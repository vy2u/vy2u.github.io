going to do a makeup starter kit for
both drugstore and high-end so I was
thinking back on my old videos and
realize that I did quite a few drugstore
starter kits so I'm not comfy so I
thought it would be fun to do a makeup
starter kit where I talk about drugstore
dupes for high-end products so that you
kind of have to to choose from I don't
have a sudden of every product like I
don't have a high-end powder and I
haven't done contour either because I
don't have like a drugstore Tanna
high-end version I just wanted to kind
of straight back to the basics and just
do so the products that I really would
recommend and I found some very very
good useful see this what I'm going to
do today I'm just going to get straight
into it and I hope you enjoy the video
first of all I'm going to start off with
primer and the prior I would recommend
which is high-end is the benefit
Porefessional Maps rescue so this is the
new version of the well of the
Porefessional and is basically a matte
gel you can put on undo a makeup it
isn't really a primer but I find it
works amazingly as one especially if you
have oily skin like I do it really does
help to keep you mouth all day even if
you have a dry skin it's so moisturizing
that it will just work perfectly on your
skin as well and it is seriously amazing
I don't actually know how much this is
but I would definitely definitely
recommend it and if you are looking for
a really good high end product go for
this a drugstore dupe for that one will
probably be the maybelline baby skin
primer the packaging is very very
similar it's very similar to the pore
fessional as well and obviously this is
a third of the price this is only 8
pounds the tube is a lot smaller and you
don't get as much product in it is still
a good primer and it is a really good
drugstore jube especially if you're
starting out with it but I don't think
it is as good as this that's just
because my skin is so oily though I'm
sure this would work perfectly for a lot
of people's skin if they have
combination or dry skin but this is
silicone based it is really lightweight
and yeah it is really good
that is definitely a drugstore dupe for
this foundation now for high-end I have
a foundation that I haven't actually
spoke about on my channel
and it is the Too Faced Born This Way I
recently got this and I really really
love it mine is in the shade snow and it
is so good the coverage is amazing and
the consistency is very thick which I
really like because that means obviously
the coverage is even higher but it
doesn't leave like streak marks it
doesn't oxidize really quick it's not
too heavy even though you think it would
be heavy it's not it's just genuinely
really good
this is either 26 or 29 pounds which is
obviously very expensive for a
foundation but if you're looking for a
high coverage one I would recommend this
address or dupe for that would probably
be my favorite foundation which is the
L'Oreal True Match this is a new formula
and as you can see you do get more in
the Born This Way bottles in the L'Oreal
True Match but then again this bottle is
a third of the price this is ten pounds
and this is around 30 pounds so I mean
it's a really really good joob though
this has in sane coverage and especially
the new formula and that old formula was
good but I think this formula is ten
times better
the coverage is amazing it's quite a
runny consistency so be careful when you
pour it onto your hand because it does
like drip if you turn your hand but just
put it onto your face blend it with a
sponge and the coverage is out of this
world
so this is definitely a drugstore dupe
for the true face for concealer I would
say my favorite high-end concealer at
the moment it's probably the NARS creamy
concealer this is such a good concealer
for under your eyes it doesn't crease at
all and especially if you have dark
under-eye circles that you're struggling
with
I was so recommend this because the
coverage is really good around here but
the only thing is this is a very good
coverage around like redness and spots
kind of just flakes off and if you just
like drive around the spot instead of
covering it over and I believe this is
22 pounds so obviously that is a lot of
money for a concealer but if you're
looking for it to be specializing in
under eyes I'd recommend this but for
spots I would recommend the Mac Pro
Longwear droves or Jeep but this would
definitely be any collection concealer
even though I much prefer this one I
think it has so much more coverage is a
sixth of the price at four pounds 19
which is crazy considering
the tube like there's not that much
difference like the lid the only reason
it looks like this is because the lid is
a lot bigger and they could see the
starts high up on the nails 1 which
means you practically get the same
amount of products and I personally
think this is better as the consistency
is a lot more thicker and creamy
meaning more coverage so I've really
really liked them so the only downside
is the packaging to this because it rubs
off and of course the package into this
doesn't very beautiful and luxurious as
I said I don't actually own a higher
powder so I'm just going to skip
straight on to blush so my favorite hide
blush is from NARS and it's the NARS
orgasm blush this is a gorgeous rose
Goldy color and I don't have this on
today I actually have the dupe for it on
today but this is really really amazing
I think they are about 24 pounds which
it's not bad I suppose but the pan is
quite thick you do get a lot of product
in there and of course the packaging is
very luxurious you can tell it's very
good quality and for the money you are
kind of paint for the brand because not
is very well known so you are kind of
paying for the brand but the quality is
really good and the pigmentation is very
high as well so if you're looking for a
really good night rosy flush this one a
drug so cheap for this would be
something I have spoken about a long
time and it is the sleek rose gold this
blusher is actually bigger I believe in
the NARS orgasm I'm just going to get
them up
yeah it's bigger than the NARS orgasm as
you can see they are practically the
same color they have the same undertone
to the only difference is the NARS one
is a little bit lighter but they are
same they rose gold this is called sleek
rose gold and then obviously orgasm but
the pan on it is really thick as well
and again only four pounds so sixth of
the price and it's such a good Joop so
if you're looking for a really good jus
for that or definitely go around sleek
because sleek blushes are really
pigmented and they last you so long as
well for I liked her height is a
difficult one because I only really use
one highlighter and that is high-end and
is the mary-lou manizer nothing can beat
this to me it's 17 pounds although you
can buy it from Superdrug but the
pigmentation is insane I have it on
today I don't know how well you can tell
because of the lighting but it is so so
amazing and even it is kind of drugstore
a drug store dupe for it would def
maybe another one from sleek and it
would be the sleek contour kit docetic
contour kit is a lot lighter as you can
see it's a lot more white toned than
this one and it doesn't have as good
pigmentation this is six pounds this is
seventeen but seriously I would
recommend this one over this one I just
really really love the pigmentation and
I don't think I will ever use another
highlighter again after using this for
Jesus that was eventful
so as I was saying a for mascara my
favorite high-end oil it would be the
Too Faced better than sex product is
amazing the packaging is so luxurious
pink and heavy which I like because it
gives you more control over the wand and
look at that one that I mean it doesn't
look amazing
like the actual wand but it really is
amazing and I'm gonna oh there we go I
just love it so much and I don't
actually have much left so I'm
definitely going to have to buy a new
one but it's so good and you definitely
again are paying for the packaging
because the product is really good but
the packaging is amazing again a
drugstore G would be the Maybelline lash
sensational they're very very similar in
sizing obviously this packaging is
better but you still got in the rose
gold effectually black writing and the
wand on this is out of this world it's
so good and you get so much product I
found this works better when it's dried
out a little while I have it on today
and it just lifts my eyelashes up so
quickly without even curling them and
this is half the price this is eight
pounds and this is 19 pounds so I mean
that voids as good as each other I think
so I would definitely recommend either
of them for eyeshadow my favorite
high-end palette will always be the
Naked 3
purely because I like pink eye shadow
colors and they make my eyes pop a lot
this is just a really gorgeous palette
and I don't really use these shades I'm
more used from this shade upwards but
it's so so nice this is actually 40
pounds but it's so amazing and the
pigmentation is are really really good
and I love the glitter shades in here
sorry so pretty and again you'll pay for
the packaging a lot as well because the
packaging is very luxurious and while
you just want it in your makeup
collection really
a drugstore dupe so for like a six of
the price would be the anyway illicium
palette it is the pink one and it is so
gorgeous it's literally an exact dupe it
has the exact same shades in it you
don't get as many you only get 10 but
these shades here like the glitter
shades those are my favorite because
they're so pigmented so any ones I don't
use out of this palette really are like
the black ones here because they're too
dark for me but this is only six pounds
and is really gorgeous the packaging is
obviously not as nice but I've really
got the item that you can see the
eyeshadows and the only thing I would
say for this palette is to add a mirror
because you don't get a mirror and it
was actually a highlighter petal in here
as well so some good finally for lips my
favorite higher lip products are
definitely Mac I love love love MAC
lipsticks these are some of my favorites
at the moment I have velvet teddy and
blankety and these are both like nude
shades this is a matte nude shade and
then this one is a shimmery slightly
lighter new shade I do have a MAC
lipstick collection on my channel if you
want to see it I'll link it down below
but I love these these are 15 pounds 50
each and they are really really good for
Sandro group so I would definitely
recommend two products so the first ones
are the NYX lingerie lipsticks these are
recently made available in Boots which I
love them they're only six pound fifty
each so basically a third of the price
of MAC lipsticks and you get a lot more
product in them they are liquid which is
obviously different but they're so good
and the packaging is very luxurious you
can tell this in a lot of thought into
it it's quite heavy which I really like
and yeah definitely recommend it and on
today's video I really hope you enjoyed
it I love filming these type of videos
there are some of my favorite to film I
actually well let me know in the
comments down below if you would like me
to do a half a high-end face 1/2 a
drugstore face in a makeup tutorial so
like you can really compare the products
I love you all so much please give this
video a huge thumbs up if you enjoyed
and I will see you in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
