back with my top 10 absolute favorite
ever makeup products that you need
that's a read on winded title I'm not
gonna call it that but today I just
fancy sitting here having a bit of a
chit chat with you guys talking about
some of my favorite makeup products I
feel like we don't sit here enough and
just have a chat and talk about makeup
things that we all love and I love
watching these videos I recently watched
Emily cannons and I think she did a few
months back and it was so good and I've
really really enjoyed it so I kind of
thought I would do one myself
and show you guys my favorite makeup
product slash brushes that I love I
spoken about some of these before serve
them I've only just shown in hauls I've
never given you kind of like my full
opinion on them but I've fallen in love
with them so yeah I just really hope you
enjoy this video and let's get started
I'm not going to go in any particular
order I'm literally just gonna pick up
random things that I have in front of me
so the first thing I have I got in my
America haul and I got it from Sephora
and I've been obsessed with it since I
used it to do my eyeshadow today and
it's the Tarte
partner in bloom palette now this
palette is so beautiful it is basically
like a makeup obsessors dream I guess it
literally it has the most gorgeous
shades in it I'm obsessed with this
shade here which is firecracker I love
the shade rebel and I also love the
shade leader because that's a really
really pigmented I'm just in love with
this palette the only thing I wish was
that they had more of a burgundy change
because I find it really hard to find
burgundy eyeshadow so I just really want
a pure burgundy so if you do know where
I can get one from or you have one
that's really good I'm really pigmented
and it's not like brown it's actually
burgundy please leave it down below
because I really want to get one but yes
I literally could not live without this
palette now I use it nearly every day
because it has such wearable shades in
it you can get this from Sephora you can
order it to the UK now or you can get it
from places like QVC for quite a bit
cheaper as well so there's a lot of
places you can get it from but the other
color I really like is Charma as well
which is the white color because it's
really pigmented and I feel that it's
very very hard to find white eyeshadows
that are really pigmented but yeah it
just has a gorgeous array of like
nytimes
and daytime shades so I would definitely
recommend this plus it has a huge mirror
which is always handy the next thing I'm
going to talk about again it is
something I use every day I use it for
school I use it on the weekends there's
not a day I don't go without wearing
this well I am wearing makeup and is the
l'oreal true match foundation now I know
how many times I've spoken about this on
my channel but I just cannot stop raving
about it it is my absolute favorite that
I have like unload of other foundations
as well which I do use but I tend to mix
them with this if I'm going to because
this one just gives me the perfect
coverage and you can just tell such a
difference before and after you have
this on as you can see or I hope you can
see my skin that's kind of like very
smooth but not to do because I've added
a little bit of powder but it just kind
of looks like the perfect complexion and
that is what I love and this cost me 10
pounds and I actually really like like
the new formula because they change the
formula a bit and I feel that this
formula suits me better than the last
one it says it's super blendable I
definitely agree it blends within
seconds and it has SPF 17 and as well
which I really like
so yeah I would definitely recommend
this and for 10 pounds from the
drugstore you literally can't go wrong
that's me I'm a really ugly Caesar the
next thing I've been obsessed with is
Rebecca and it's the Becca X Jaclyn hill
champagne pop highlighter again I picked
this up in Sephora and it is my favorite
thing ever just look at that glow I
really hope you can see that I have it
on today I really hope you can see it
because it's literally like glowing I
love it so much it cost me $40 but to me
it was so worth it because the packaging
amazing the product is amazing quality
plus I love drag queen Hills so what can
go wrong the next things I have are many
eyeshadows and I have this on today I
don't know if you can see it I have like
an iridescent glitter I think that's the
word yeah and I have it like on my lid
and these are the wet and wild color
icon single glitters I've got these in
Walgreens but you can get these on
places like eBay or Amazon and I paid a
pound for them each I think it worked
out up no I didn't it was out of our 50
P each so I got a pink shade I got an
iridescent white shade and I got a
copper shade today I have this little
white shade on but I don't know if you
can see
it's gone like a copper color because it
kind of picks up the color you have
underneath which I love and I've been
looking for like pigmented glitter eye
shadows for ever because you see on like
Instagram accounts that people have
these really pigmented lids and I'm like
how they done that I just can't do it I
feel like these would be more pigmented
if I had mac's fix+
which I am really looking into getting
because I think I do need it but I would
literally so recommend these I love them
I'm obsessed the next thing I have is
another thing I spoke about on my
channel before and is a proper obsession
of mine and it's the Maybelline lash
sensational mascara I still remember
when this came out and I was so hyped
about it I don't still AM I swear it's
been out for like over a year now and
I'm still just as hyped it's the best
mascara ever like I have gone through
four tubes out I want to say this is my
fourth tube or my fifth I literally buy
it doctor
I literally buy it over and over again
and I can never fault this I wouldn't
like layer and layer and layer it up
because yes it could get very cakey but
I seriously have no faults of this it's
eight pounds and gate from Superdrug or
boots and I just love the wand on it I
use like the longer bristles for my top
lashes and then smaller more denser
bristles for the bottom lashes and I
just love it
it's a plastic applicator which I get
along really well with so I definitely
recommend this next thing I have is a
concealer and again I'm obsessed with
this ever since I bought it in America
and it is the maybelline instant age
rewind concealer I was very skeptical
about buying this because I paid I think
8 dollars in America which is basically
the same as it is in England but I've
seen this in England for so long now and
so many people recommend it Emily Canham
spoke about the one that she got from
America and she said that she really
liked it so I thought I would pick it up
in America and I loved it they have so
many more shades to choose from out
there and I feel like I pick the perfect
shade for me this is fair and I don't
know if you can get this exact shade in
England but I love it it's really really
high coverage and is perfect for under
your eyes so 100% recommend this I then
have two lip colors that I'm currently
obsessing over and I literally couldn't
live without them I'm wearing them both
today because I kind of did
I can on Bray lick with them but the
first one is kylie jenner's candy cane
matte lipstick and the second one is
anastasia beverly hills lipstick in
milkshake both matte liquid lipsticks
which are my favorite lipsticks to go
for at the moment I have a more stick
lipstick in forever code is obsessed
with matte lipsticks I think they last
so much longer they look so much nicer
on your lips and they don't come off as
easy this shade is like the perfect nude
shade for me it's the base shade that I
have on and as you can see this shown is
a lot more lighter and pink toned so
I'll just pop this in the middle to
create like an ombre lip going from the
out to the in and I just love it the
packaging of these two is such
high-quality as well because I think I
paid I think this works out at about 22
with the lip liner and this works out
about 15 so I think they're really
reasonably priced the amount of product
you get and I use these nearly every day
and they're nowhere near right now and
the final things I have to recommend to
you are two of my favorite brushes and
I've been obsessed with these for I'm
gonna say what well one I'm not longer
than the other cuz I only kind of
recently got this one but nearly a year
and it's the Real Techniques bold metals
tapered brush I love this so much I use
it for my highlight so I just dab it on
and then just like strobe it in I
literally love this I find it's so easy
to hold because of how heavy it is that
it feels like a proper makeup brush and
the bristles aren't too dense but
they're quite like flexible at the same
time and they wash up really nice that
the product just comes instantly off
them weave like baby shampoo and then
they drive really nice which I think you
need in a brush because obviously you do
need to clean them this is quite pricey
I think it works out about 20 pounds but
I got it for Christmas in like a makeup
brush gift set from my nan and I think
it's out a lot cheaper but I really do
love this did you wait to see what the
makeup come off that oh my god this sort
of like highlight point off it
I don't eat your eyes and see the final
thing that I'm obsessed with is from
zoeva and they sent this to my PO Box
which I was like really happy about and
it's a zoeva two to seven luxe soft
definer brush this is one of their like
copper pink brush ranges and I love it I
wanted to try to even the rose gold
brush set forever so when I found that I
sent you
teller brushes I was like over the moon
and I've been using this in a corner
highlight around here and then on the
point of my nose and just like my
Cupid's bow here because I love how
light in my Cupid's bow
I literally just love this so much it's
so beautiful it's such a good quality
brush and I would really recommend it
because the bristles again are so nice
so - the end of my video I really really
really hope you enjoyed it let me know
if you did by giving it a huge thumbs up
my top stuck on with them I love all
these products so much and I would
definitely recommend all of them to you
this isn't sponsored these just my
opinions and I love all of them let's
see if we can smash 6,000 lights and I
will see you in next week's video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
