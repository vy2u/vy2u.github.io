really doing at my Christmas gift guide
for 2016 so I've done a few of these
over my time on YouTube and I love doing
these videos because every year amazing
at beauty brands bring out all these
different sets and I want to tell you
what I think is the perfect Christmas
gift
through your friends your family your
girlfriend boyfriend anything you want
buy them so this is going to be all
beauty products it is the girls or the
boys because boys their makeup so this
is a kind of a gift going over boys and
girls as well so yeah I'm really looking
forward to this video and because I
don't have the product with me I am
going to be putting kind of like
overlaid on the screen video I'm so
excited because it's Christmas so soon
and this is going up in December I think
so so excited yeah I really hope you
enjoy the video and let's just get
started the first thing that I would
definitely say a girl would love this
year is the brownie Real Techniques
marble Diamond Beauty Blender sponge
this has come out just in time for
Christmas and this is on my Christmas
list I want it so bad
it's a gorgeous diamond sponge but it's
got marble imprint on it my god any girl
would dream of that for Christmas so
that would be perfect for friends or
maybe your sister who really likes
makeup or you really likes our Nick
because literally I love Sam and Nick
and I love Rome technique so that's
perfect for anybody really another
present I think is perfect for friends
and people who are makeup lovers are the
morphe palette I've recently spoke about
these in a few videos because I am
obsessed with the morphe you do the most
amazing amazing palettes the
pigmentation is incredible
I don't know that these are one of
people's which litters this year I've
asked for the 35 oh and I have the 35 T
but they are so good and 435i shadows
are 20 pounds you literally cannot go
wrong so if you want to treat your
friends or you want to treat maybe even
your mum I think that's the perfect gift
set another place to do really good gift
sets which I'm sure you all know already
is lush now I'd love to come out with
some of Borges a Christmas gift sets
this year my kind of favorite is the
ones that have Snow Fairy and because
Snow Fairy
definitely my favorite scent but they've
bought out gift sets perfect for mums
dads brothers sisters and friends the
oil gives it to everything and they are
all of different price ranges as well
which I really like there's some for 8
pounds which you could get for your
friends but there's also something like
30 pounds so if you want to go treat
your mum then you could get her one of
them but I think it's really good value
because you get quite a few products in
them but again my favorite ways are Snow
Fairy one and I think you get snow fairy
shower gel I think candy mountain if
it's wrong I'll put it on the screen but
yeah literally lush is the best place to
go if you were stuck for Christmas items
because they are the best gift set
another gift set range is a very very
popular if YouTube is especially around
Christmas time are these soap &amp;amp; Glory
gifts that you can get these in Boots
and they are genuinely incredible they
again they have all different price
ranges so they have some 4 5 pounds they
have some 10 pounds but and they also
have the big one that is 60 pounds which
has like everything in I always tend to
wait until the Boxing Day sales to get
my soap &amp;amp; Glory but I do also get the
Christmas and classic always on three
for two as well if you're looking at
getting your friend something or your
sister something because I love how
kinda like Bath sets or they love soakin
glory that is definitely the route to go
down because they're fairly cheap you
get really good products for your money
and they just smell amazing like
seriously some other sets that I think
recently you're going to do really well
this Christmas actually are the brand
new maybelline gift set you can get
these on Amazon and maybe Nina go out
for like Christmas gift sets and you get
three baby tips in one and in three
blushes in another one I believe that on
4 to 5 pounds to buy and I don't know if
you'll be able to buy them from
supertalk or boots although I'm pretty
sure you will but I've seen them on
Amazon and again I'll link them down
below but they are gorgeous especially
if you are another Maybelline makeup and
it's a lot cheaper than buying them
separately like on Amazon the lip balms
with 3 pounds for 3 where they're meant
to be 3 pounds each so genuinely you're
saving yourself a lot of money and again
I lift them all down below but this is
kind of perfect for your friends I feel
and they also do like nail gift set and
I saw a gift as well it comes in a
makeup bag with some of their skincare
stuff that you can only get in America
so seriously I would definitely
recommend getting maybelline gift sets
this year or put them on your Christmas
list because genuinely I really want
them as well something else
would be perfect for a makeup lover or
perfect if you want to spend a bit more
as these are a little bit more on the
karate side but if you kind cosmetics
Holiday Collection she recently released
her holiday collection and I know you
can only buy on certain dates because it
sells out just like that but genuinely
it is the most gorgeous thing it's all
white and silver so it's perfect that
any makeup lover and it's absolutely
gorgeous he's done special lip kit color
she's done white car liner she's got
minis everything under the Sun but
obviously it is really hard to get so
that's more of yeah I'm putting that on
my Christmas list because I really want
it even though I doubt I'll get it but I
really like some of that stuff so yeah
that's more if you want to spend a bit
more money of course you don't have to
spend that much money could Christmas is
all about the presents but that is just
an idea another high-end brands that do
really nice Christmas sets are two-faced
and two-faced actually sent me some of
their Christmas sets and they do a
really nice one and you get three little
separate packages in it where you get a
two-faced melted I think it was an a
blusher literally it's so gorgeous and
they have little gift tags ons you can
give them to three of your friends if
you're quite a small friendship group
and you just want to buy like little
things you just get that and split them
between people which is the idea of the
present which I personally really like
it's so beautiful that could be perfect
if you have quite small friendship group
maybe and they're really into makeup
again two-face has the most amazing sets
somewhere else I would definitely
recommend going if you are maybe buying
for your nan or your mum is the body
shop the body shop have the most amazing
Christmas range this year they actually
sent me some and I love love love the
sin my favourite scent is a spiced apple
because I actually really like Apple
scented things and I love eating like
Apple scented sweets not scented play
but I really like apple and it is
incredible the body shop is a bit more
expensive but it's so so worth it and I
would definitely recommend it I have the
body shop I've been kinder this year and
I'm so excited to get like digging dug
into it on December 1st there's I think
there's 25 or 24 I'm not too sure but
you get full-size products and minis in
it so I love it but yeah that's
basically
like if guide there's loads of different
things with different price ranges here
I'm going to put loads of the screen
just so you guys can get loads of
different ideas on what you could buy
all your different family members I find
it's videos so so helpful just to see
what brands have come out with this year
and it just kind of helps me know what I
want to get my friends and my family so
yeah if you did enjoy this video give it
a huge thumbs up and also smash a huge
thumbs up if you excited for Christmas
because Christmas is literally like less
than a month away and I am a buzzing but
you know I know it always so so much and
I will see you in next week's video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
