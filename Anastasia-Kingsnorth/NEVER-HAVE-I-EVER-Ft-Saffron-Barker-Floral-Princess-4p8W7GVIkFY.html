here with saffron
hi and we are going to be filming the
never have I ever challenged so if you
don't know what the other half I have a
challenge is it's basically where we
have a list of questions which are kind
of could be embarrassing and could like
tell a lot about us when we say the
answers and we have these little cars to
say I have and then they say never and
we just have to hold them up when we
answer the questions and bear in mind we
don't really know much about each other
so my vitamin virus and yes I oppose the
creations are a bit like the questions
could um reveal quite a bit so um yeah
hope you enjoy the video and let's get
started the first question is never have
I ever peed in the shower many sides I
know I'm gonna live you know I need
everybody hands oh it's because I just
stand there and also I suppose this
could go for like peeing in the swimming
pool as well
do you mean oh oh that's funny about it
saying I always like the water is like
soap this time discussing the disc it is
so worn I don't really want to get out
yeah and like they're so important I'm
just like oh Justin yes I think
practically everybody watching this
would have to but no one in a minute yes
a so people are all hats disgusting that
you peed in the yeah but everybody knows
it I am everyone does I bet everybody
watching this has done it right never
have I ever fallen over in public i I
have I have it's so embarrassing I fell
in Lewis many times I fell over at
school me and amber were the first out
school we were walk-in with a load of
people behind us and my foot just the
front of my shoe got caught on something
and I just I didn't know what happened I
just went I just completely I was so bad
there's people they're all behind me so
you could literally see Anna's girl as
well as all eyes in vice and no girl I'd
never have I ever farted in public
dude I think we're gonna have I have I'm
just telling everybody like embarrassing
things about myself where did you fight
and put it off I'd like that's not all I
always find sometimes I wanted me and
sometimes are worth it
like ESCO words it out so yeah most of
School Psychologists fires and then
we'll all sniff around for a cue smell
it yet yeah that's kind of off you
tipping and is that your flavor on the
buzzer next year well if that busy isn't
me yes sometimes I'll just go you smell
that yeah misfire and then rinse on like
off I just fire and especially is never
have I ever been attracted to a teacher
yeah there's like this one teacher in
school and I mean it every kid fancies
him every student has a passion having
no alive I don't want to say who it is
because I know that teachers know about
it now but we have a really really hot
never I never have I ever wish
McDonald's had a delivery service yeah
yeah I like this one because it laughs
we're in New York they actually do have
a delivery yeah I do I spent those a
rumor combined in England I was getting
so fast for it they didn't ever have my
lord of it to be honest it would be
amazing but I'd be really hard for them
please yes well I like I don't actually
get McDonald's at marks but it will be
pretty calm you would be yeah hope it
ends oh if the delivery was free and
like there wasn't a specific amount you
have to all you just get like chips
delivered well yeah yeah there'll be
good I would be amazing
