going to be doing at my pamper routine
for 2016 I'm literally so excited for
this video I don't know why I get so
excited to film pamper routines because
there's just me talking through what I
do on a relaxing night but literally
these are one of the most exciting
videos ever for me to film so if I'm at
hype in this video sorry
quick note though I still have a really
bad cold in a coughs I'm sorry if I'm
like Kaufering and cough coughing and
spluttering like everywhere because you
know uh yeah it's just horrible but
without further ado I'm just going to
get straight into the video because
seriously I can't will the to sitio
blabber on about my cold suck it up and
cope with it anesthesia last film okay
the first thing I love to do on a
pan-pan die is pretty basic I've said it
a lot before and it is clean my room I
don't know why but clean a room on a
pamphlet evening just makes me feel so
good I'm so refresh like just the
satisfaction of spring everything can
thinking that it's clean like I'm I
would've had a routine like sighs my
room how sad is that like I'm 15 and I'm
saying my room is having a pamper
routine yeah I definitely think cleaning
my room is like my number one thing on a
pamper routine that is what I would do
I just feel ready to go like once my
room is clean and tidy my bed is all
like freshly made ready for me to get in
I'm sore my room is tidy and I've lit a
few candles as well just to set the mood
I will actually pluck my eyebrows I
don't like do anything to my eyebrows
makeup wise I just leave the natural
because I think if I do something to
them and I like it then I won't want to
leave the house without it so I just
kind of don't even bother with them and
I just leave them but I do like to like
pluck them and like trim them everything
even though they're not really much of a
shape and to be honest they're quite
crap but still like to pluck them once
I've kind of done like all of my eyebrow
e.type that type of thing I'll then move
on to a face mask and I've actually
recently been using a new face mask I
think I've used it sweet yeah three
times now viewed on three hamper
evenings and this is again something
I've never spoken about but I got it
purely because so many people raved
about it and it is any quick fix facials
calming clay masks for sensitive
redskin but I actually have really
raised sensitive skin and you probably
can't tell that where I have makeup on
obviously not
but then when I take my makeup off I
have a lot of blemishes and redness and
I felt like this would be a good one for
me to get a lot of people have been
using this one a lot of people use the
one in the green tube but I felt like
this one would be a good one for me and
so far it is worked like it is so good I
got this from Tesco and it was only one
pound fifty one fifty to two pounds and
you get ten facials out of this although
I'm pretty sure I'm going to get more I
literally love this product so much and
the packaging is just like right at my
street as well it's just like pink green
white so I love this
and seriously I also recommend it like
it's such it's just such a good match
it's so like the consistency it's just
like not too thin not too thick it
doesn't slip or slide off your face it
just sits there and then when you want
to wash it off it genuinely does call
for that leaving a load of residue and
you only have to leave on for like five
to ten minutes I leave mine on for 15
because I feel like the log relief on
the better the job it will do but really
you only have to leave on for a few
minutes and it genuinely does work while
I have my face mask on it is then time
to pick all of my things out for my bath
so as I said in the title this is going
to include some of the brand-new zoila
Beauty sweetness roses range which I was
so excited about like this range is just
like right at my street like it's the
exact type of thing that I love I love
sweet scent sweet scent - just like my
favorite thing in the world and rose
gold and pink packaging just tops that
off so literally when I saw the shoes
bringing this out felt passing out so I
won't know I use less in my bath but as
I said I'm just going to talking about
the zone of you 2 things today because I
always use lush and I just wanted to use
a bit of like something different so
this is the zoella beauty the fierce
fragrance bar and I absolutely love this
as you can see the packaging is like
this coppery golden and pastel pink and
it's just it's just amazing like you can
see the genuine thought that has gone
into this design and it's just so nice I
said I bought the fizz bar from the
tutti-frutti range and then like the
original range and I've loved them so
much this one it says drop four pieces
into the warm bath I usually use
one or two times what I did with the
original bar because you've got eight
pieces but I have no fault in these I
love them so much they work so good like
the water just go it is really nice
light white color and it just makes the
water feel really soft if that's
possible I just love these and these are
only five pounds so seriously I would
definitely recommend these and the other
thing that I've used in my bath and I
just oh my god I was so excited for this
because especially cuz of the packaging
and if you own a beauty sugar dip so
this is like a square based pyramid in
packaging and it just has this golden
ribbon around the edge and it just says
so long as sugar dip and then you open
it and like this is only the packaging
and then you have this really cute
little bag inside and it has the same
design as these on and it just says so
Ella Beauty sugared it scented bath salt
granules and they're just so nice to
play with it doesn't run there's like a
room efficient but if you didn't want
laughs outside just kind of like
sprinkle a few of them in and it just
makes the water go like a really nice
pale whitish color and yeah they just
facile to realize they just make the
water very soft again along with the
Fitz bar but I love these so much these
are six pounds and I definitely say
they're worth it
I've seen a lot of good reviews on these
so far on YouTube and I absolutely love
them I just love everything about this
range like the packaging and just
everything about this range is right at
my street like I'm not going to be able
to track any of this away like packaging
wise when I finish with it I'm just
going to keep it in my room and like
provide a place on my shelf because it's
just so gorgeous so yes I would
definitely recommend you go and try some
so use new products they are so good and
you can get them into super drove or and
feel unique so then whilst I'm like
running my bath and everything I will
light some candles set the mood a little
bit positively put something on my
laptop if I amp it is only coming up top
is most probably going to be Netflix
because Netflix right like the only
thing I get connection on in the
bathroom but whilst I'm in the bath I
will wash my body and I wash my body
with the honeycomb secret by tree equal
moon and this is the bath and shower gel
I have an obsession with this like how
much am I used it's gone right all
around the bottle but I've used it down
to here and it is so good oh my god you
can buy this in Tesco if you're buying
like super dope as well and it's only
what I paid to have
but I think they're not about three to
four pounds but the bottle is such a
good size and for the money I cannot
fault this it foams up so much and it
just feels so nice on your body like
they do so many scents in this but as I
said I take very well to like the sweet
scent so I love love love this and yeah
I've just been using this on an everyday
basis so I would definitely recommend
this again whilst I bought it in the
bath I will wash my face - cough and use
a scrub so I've recently been using the
t-zone black haired fighting facial
scrub because I needed a scrub that was
going to fight off blackheads because I
have quite a lot of blackheads which can
get really really frustrating especially
around like my nose area so a lot of
people have recommended this and it's
only 99p from places like BM ho bargains
places like that and it's just so cheap
and so good like I've used it three
times now and I know she's are different
from like putting on my makeup like it
just feels a lot more smoother and when
you scrub this off you can genuinely see
the blackheads coming out of your nose
so 99p that is so worth to buy I pamper
I also like to wash my hair and I've
recently been loving a new shampoo and
conditioner and it is the Garnier
ultimate blends the delicate souza it
just comes in this huge white bottle and
it's like a whitey pastel pink and it
smells of like clean towels and like
fresh linen it just has such a nice
fresh smell and I just love this so much
my hair has been so much softer I can't
even explain how much softer my hair has
been through using this like I feel not
using a shampoo like dedicated to making
your hair softer really does make it
softer because that's what that's what
this is gonna do on the bowl but it
genuinely does like I would recommend
this I feel like I'm like promoting
Tesco but I got this from Tesco for two
pounds as well like news of two pounds
each and for the size bottle light you
can't go wrong so cheap not promoting
Tesco why I'm from Tesco but I'm not you
know what I mean but test go two pounds
Tesco are gonna love me for this so once
I chilled in the bath I live you know
like chilled basically chilled I will
come out of the bath and I will
moisturize I will use the Vaseline
intensive
Kokura radiant cocoa butter body lotion
and this again is a fairly recent
purchase in the last night three or four
weeks all I glazed some good again this
cut this is cocoa butter so quite sweet
and I just love this so much this is
just the smaller size guess why I got
this from Tesco as you can see I love my
little late-night Tesco trips where I go
to the beauty aisle and just pick a
couple of the beauty stuff but I love
this so much and it makes my legs feel
really really soft so if you are looking
for like a new body lotion that isn't
too expensive I would go for something
like this when I'm out of the bath it is
time to kind of just chill and take a
bit of downtime because I don't want to
be sitting in the bath for too long I
like to just lay on my bed and like have
a chill-out
though I also just like paint my nails
while I'm there I'll probably either
paint my nails using the color show
jelly tint from Maybelline these are
brand new and I love these this one is a
shade four five eight fusion fusion
Easter fusion Easter all like something
like this like lights even bury em like
Ines just paint my nails with anything
love painting my nails it's a nice
little hobby even though when I was a
disgusting right now I love painting my
nails at waiting for them to drive like
the hardest thing ever because I'm going
to see oh yeah they're dry it's fine
wake up now the full of lines from my
god damn duvet but yeah I will then it
just kind of sit watch movies on Netflix
I'm addicted addicted to love Ireland at
the moment I feel this like a week in
advance but I'm so excited for like the
upcoming drama it's like it may be like
classic UK television but I absolutely
love it or I will go on Netflix and
watch something on Netflix because I'm
also a huge Netflix addict but yeah that
is basically my pam-4 routine it's just
quite simple it's quite basic I don't do
anything too out of the ordinary but I
hope you enjoyed me using like a ton of
new products because I wanted to show
you guys a lot of new products things I
don't really you like what I've used but
don't showing videos but yeah I really
hope you enjoyed today's video if you
did let me know by giving it a huge
thumbs up and let me know if you want me
to do more videos like with Isabella
Beauty because I want to buy all of it
it just wasn't in stock when I ordered
it online like it went out and stuff
like that or Superdrug don't know that
was just for me but I wanted like the
perfume and the body fondant but it
wasn't that yeah I really hope you

thumbs up and I will see you next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
