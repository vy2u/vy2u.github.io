back and I am going to doing a huge
autumn and winter Primark haul for 2017
everybody loves a good protocol I love a
good Primark haul especially when the
seasons change I always like YouTube
Primark cool autumn 2017 just to see
what Primark of going before I take a
trip there I know you guys left my final
chords on this channel so I thought that
was an excuse to go and do a little
Primark shop so I went to Primark bought
a ton of things and I'm very excited to
show you them all so this video is in a
collaboration with an amazing app called
21 buttons which basically allows you to
post photos of your clothes and on that
picture you can add a little button and
when the person that clicks the button
it will take you directly to the website
of where that item of clothing is from
making it so much easier to shop where
you got your outfit from I personally
love this app because if you see a
picture on there I wonder where she got
the trousers from click the button and
it will take you directly to the website
or think oh I love her jumper again it
will take you directly to the website so
it's such an easy way to shop since I'm
a notice that I've ordered two items of
clothing and because of what I saw on
there so I'd definitely recommend it and
if you guys want to go and see some
exclusive looks and some exclusive
pictures or shop what I bought in this
hole then you guys can go down to the
first link in the description box follow
me and download the app again without
further ado let's just get straight on
into new Primark all so the first thing
I've got is from like the pajama section
I always say jamás pajamas and I love
this so much I was wearing in my vlogs
and so many of you are like where is
this from
and it's just basically like a camo
printed t-shirt dress thing with a rose
gold Mickey Mouse I love this so much it
was only 5 pounds and it's just a long
like 90 dress type thing but for 5
pounds that's so good and even though
it's winter this is like I guess like a
hotter autumn a winter night but it's so
nice I love this so much and yeah the 5
pounds I thought that was a really good
bargain so I love that person I love
Disney and oh I just realize that our
printers got a little Mickey Mouse heads
in as well that's so cute right there -
picked up my winter scarf because I
don't really like to spend like - too
much on scars because I never really end
up wearing them
that much so I just wanted to pop up and
picked up this one it's just a big long
black one it was four pounds so I
thought that was really inexpensive and
it's got these little black like tassel
things on the end the full pound I
thought that was really good and I've
actually realized mine covered in
glitter which I don't really know what
that's from but yeah I love this so much
I've wore it out maybe three or four
times now and it really has kept me warm
so I picked this up and I love this it's
really easy to pair with outfit you can
wear it with jumpers and jeans and
basically everything that you wear
probably the best scoffs as well I then
picked up one of their like basic
t-shirt things but this is actually a
white and I can't tell if this is Navy
or black but white with navy slash black
stripes on it this was only two pounds
fifty and that's so good because I feel
like there was such a phase where like
stripes were like prop it in and like
you'd wear stripes in red lipstick and
you look a little bit like a sailor but
like they was really in and I really
loved that so I thought I'd bring it
back again I'd buy stripy t-shirt as I
said it was only two pounds fifty and
it's just like a normal long-sleeved
circle neck cousin what you call these
necks t-shirt I just really liked it if
a too puffy for you really can't go
wrong they also have them in basically
every other color like red pink grey
black white blue literally every color
you can think of they had these t-shirts
in so that's really good to pair as well
with the scarf love it I then picked up
some trousers now Primark is always an
iffy place for me to get charles's from
because I try them on I'm like is it
gonna fit I don't know my direct size in
Primark I never really know what I'm
gonna go for so when I found these I was
like oh my god are they gonna fit me cuz
I really like them they fit perfect
these are some like grey tight stretchy
cigarette trousers and I never know when
my trousers in Primark but I fell in
love with these so they've got a zip
down the side there's no like button or
anything and they're like quite stretchy
as you guys can see and it's just like a
dark gray material which is really nice
they look a bit Navy on camera but I
promise this pairs gray and then at the
bottoms it's very like tight-fitting
it's shaped around your leg really well
they're tight water way down but then
you can obviously roll them up into the
height you want that I love these so
much they're very flattering as well
which is always nice and yeah I just
love these so much and these are only 7
pounds it's to me is such a bargain for
trousers because normally I go to places
like top
and I'll pay 40 pounds for a pair of
jeans but the seven pounds I will get so
much wear out of these plus I love the
color it's a bit different to black
because I always wear black jeans so for
me to have red bottoms that's actually
really nice like a pairing with
different things I love them so much I
actually bought a second pair and I got
back and got a pair in navy because they
were just so comfy once I wore them I
was like yep you know what I'm in love I
have to go back and get another pair so
I bought another pair although the
zippers broke it hasn't it's fixed it's
fine but yeah I love these so much again
really stretchy as you can see this is
just more like a Navy pair so actually
you can see the color difference so if I
hold them up at the same time which is
you know it's just really nice and
they're really comfy for seven pounds so
if you do want something very flexible
which isn't really easy and like
comforting to wear definitely definitely
recommend these I then went and picked
up a winter's jumper now I was walking
through all of the jumpers and normally
I don't really get that many jumpers I'm
the type of person just to wear t-shirts
with a coat so I thought you know what
I'm just gonna buy myself a jumper and I
fell in love with this one purely
because of the edge that it has so this
it's basically just a big white fluffy
knitted jumper and I rolled up the
sleeves just so it looks a bit like
better on me because the sleeves were
very very big at the end at the bottom
it's all like ripped and like tarted I
can't really explain it but like it's
just got loads of rips in and little
bits hanging off and this is literally
like me and a jumper I wear like the rip
tops and like all of rough edge tops and
stuff so to be able to find this in a
jumper so good this was 10 pounds I
haven't actually wore it yet I still got
the label in it but for 10 pounds for a
winter and like warm winter / autumn
jumper that's so good and honestly you
couldn't really get that like anywhere
else does that make sense so I love this
so so so much but yeah it's just very
big to be honest it's quite long so I
don't even know if I'm going to be able
to like wear it is a jumper dress or
work with jeans because it might just
look odd if I wear it with jeans I don't
really know
and these try it on again I did try it
off I just loved the edge of it so much
that I bought it anyway
absolutely love this so primal is it
definitely the place to go if you're
looking for some very inexpensive winter
jumpers because they have these in every
single color they had a really nice
mustard colored one but I already have a
mustard color one that had a really nice
burgundy one as well so proper autumn
colors so I definitely recommend Primark
for the jumpers and
then the last clothing item I picked up
was a shirt and I've wanted just like a
normal shirt to wear jeans for so long
and I can never find one I really wanted
to blue a white pinstripe point but I
could just never find one I really
really liked and then I found this
tartan one and it was only seven pounds
and it's like a mustard gray and at navy
one and it looks better in person than
in on camera but it's so nice again I've
just rolled up the sleeves and it's just
like basically a normal shirt and I
thought this would look really nice in
ripped jeans and like trainers in autumn
the 7 pounds this is so good as oh
because wherever else you go you
probably be paying 20 or 25 for this and
the quality it was just the same I
haven't wore it yes I don't know if it's
gonna be very itchy or whatever but it
looks really comfy and it looks quite
warm as well so to be honest I'm very
excited to wear this and yeah I just
picked this up and it was only 7 pounds
then I picked up some other little bits
from like the homeware section and stuff
but the first of all I went to a beauty
section and I picked up some hair bands
because you can never have too many hair
bands and now I have a pack of 60
because I literally ran out I had zero
other than these two on my hand because
I always keep telling my hand and then I
did she fall you know what because he's
a too dark remember to go buy some
blonde one so these are only a pound for
a pack of 60 and you can't really go
wrong with Primark and their hair balls
so I should get like thick ones and thin
ones and knees and they're all different
color so they can blend in with your
hair which I love I then picked up
something from the hope section and this
is actually from our new Christmas range
because I only had a little bit of the
Christmas range out but I really wanted
some of it so this is a cup and it says
it's the season to Sparkle and I love
this so much
and it says shaped me and it's because
it's got like all of their sequins and
stuff all the way round so then you can
just kind of like shake it even I
wouldn't probably shake it with a drink
it because it would come out but I don't
know it's just so so cute I love it so
much and then obviously you've got like
the rose gold lid and you've got the
black writing we've got the black and
white candy stripes straw this was only
three pounds which I thought was really
good and I love Primark cups like always
by Primark cups and mugs won't get them
from anywhere else because primal is so
inexpensive and they're so nice so yeah
anywhere else you'd be paying on temper
over this but Prime out three pounds and
I love it this is definitely gonna be my
autumn and winter cup to drink from
finally I picked up a bruise for
you know I've really didn't think I was
gonna buying it because I never normally
buy Overeem sprays I don't really bother
with that type of stuff but then I went
to the Christmas section and oh my god
it smelt incredible see it's only three
pounds and it says number 25 a winter
spice frosted cinnamon room spray and
it's just in this like clear bottle with
a white snowflake pattern in a silver
lid and it smells so good I was gonna
spray it on me but then I realized it's
room spray oh my god it literally smells
like Christmas you know when you just
got that and really distinctive
Christmassy smell that's exactly what it
smells I so I'm just gonna oh my god I
really hope this lasts because it smells
so nice I can imagine paying at my
little fireplace on my laptop and just
spray in this I'm like watching a movie
that is that a proper cozy so that's the
end of this video I really hope you guys
