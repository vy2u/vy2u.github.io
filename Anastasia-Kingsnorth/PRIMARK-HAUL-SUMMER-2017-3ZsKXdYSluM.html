and I am going to be doing an absolutely
huge Primark haul for summer 2017 now I
went into Primark yesterday knowing that
I was going to buy things to do a haul
and I actually found a lot of things
that I liked I've been watching it so
many prime articles recently and prolog
are just killing it they have such good
stuff and they have like the things that
are really in fashion but for really
affordable prices so I thought I'm going
there buy some of things I've really
wanted for a long time that if I went
into places like Topshop would be super
expensive and buy a few guys and put
little hoard together to show you you
don't actually have to spend that much
money to get really affordable
fashionable things see ya guys basically
I'm assuming in a Primark haul today fun
fact the first ever video I did on one
of my first ever beauty channels which
wasn't actually this one was a Primark
haul and I remember I still had this set
up but I filmed it from more that way
and I just looked so different I look so
young and it's amazing to think of how
far I've come since I did that to know
doing this with over 260 thousand of you
watching like it's incredible see we
just throwing it back a bit today and
doing a good old Primark haul so I hope
you enjoy and let's get stuff so
starting off is clothing I didn't
actually get that many clothes because I
find it hard to shop for clothes I
prefer go in there for accessories but I
did actually find some really nice
things so the first thing I got is this
Nirvana top and I am really into kind of
the fans t-shirts the rocky t-shirts at
the moment I think they're really cool
and I really like them so this one was
only 8 pounds and it's a pastel pink
color it just says Nirvana
then it's got this cute little picture
here and yeah that's basically it it's
really simple it's just a basic t-shirt
really it's not much to it I'm just
going to tuck this into some jeans and
just kind of bag it over a bit it will
look really like slouchy and I just
really like this this was only 8 pounds
which is such a good price for like a
t-shirt like this like these teachers
are only really expensive so go to
Primark and then have a whole section of
these and for 8 pounds
pretty good and then as you guys
probably know cropped hoodies are really
in fashion at the moment as well and I
have quite a few already but then when I
went in I saw this one and I was like
it's so nice so you'll probably see I'm
running color theme through this video
so I'm sorry but it's pastel pink and
then at the bottom it just says forever
or Never and I love this it just has Y
little draw strings and then it has a
hoodie but I just thought this would be
really cute and slouchy just to kind of
wear out to the shops or just like Evan
Graham at my friend's house I thought
this would be nice and there's a fly
think it's on the spiderweb but this was
only eight pounds I think as well which
is such a good price for a cropped
hoodie and it also got the raw cut edges
at the bottom which I really like I
don't like it when hoodies have the
tight waistband I just thought like they
don't look right on me
but these hoodies I really like and for
eight pounds you can't go wrong I then
picked up some drama shorts because I
much prefer sleeping in shorts during
the summer I just feel like they're a
lot more Airy and a lot more flowy and I
just much prefer them but I have just
realized I bought these in a medium and
I am a small so yeah nevertheless these
are my drama shorts they've just got
this kind of like leafy pattern on I
guess they just black with a little
tassels at the end and they've got the
odd nude leaf colored in which is really
pretty and these are only two pounds
fifty which is so cheap for drama shorts
like Primark pajamas and literally what
I live in I love them so much and when I
saw that they have like all of these for
2050 I knew I just have to get a pair
but it's also really good if you're
going away on holiday and you could even
I don't know just these don't even look
like Java shorts to be fair but you
could go on the beach in these and get
away with it I feel these are really
nice and they wanted you to pal fifty
then I got another pair of drama shorts
which definitely do look more like Java
shorter than the other pair and I've got
these in the right size I've got these
in a small and they look like this
they're just it's like navy blue color
but they look black on camera but they
are navy blue with this lace detail
around the edge this cute little ribbon
and again these are only two pound fifty
I feel like prymaat pajamas are so good
if you don't have a lot of money but you
just want to be comfortable and like
4150 Rico complain they're so good the
quality of the product is really really
high and you can also get like these two
pal 50 t-shirts to go with them but
personally I just literally like kind of
throw on a plane or baggy t-shirt like I
don't really buy drama t-shirts I tend
to just buy the bottoms but these are
we'll all be living in throughout the
spring and summer so thanks Primark you
got some really good jobs at the moment
then moving on to shoes I'm so chuffed
with these shoes because I had a pair
last summer I've got from Topshop and
they rubbed on my feet so bad the basic
thing I've got some of these shoes I'm
not really sure they're called but they
were only 5 pounds what a bargain and
they're just black snake skinny leathery
type of thing and they're just got a
thick black sole here and they are so
comfy when I tried to run in the shop I
think these are gonna look so nice with
jeans and just like the band t-shirts
and the Rakhi t-shirts I think it'll
look really good because I've basically
been living in my new Annie - trainers
which I showed in a haul about maybe a
month ago I've literally lived in them
from months straight and I feel like I
needed to get some new shoes to kind of
like break it up a bit so don't wear
them as much but I really like these for
the spring and summer they're quite airy
and you don't wear them with socks
either which is quite nice so really
good football weathers and yet you know
only 5 pounds so if you want some of
these definitely go to Primark I
wouldn't go anywhere else because the
other places the shoes really rubbed on
me but Primark shoes just they're so
good they've picked up this hat which is
really different to what I would usually
wear but it basically is a baseball cap
and it just says thanks but no thanks
so I know how well it suits me but I
fill up with the winged eyeliner and
like some glass I feel like it look like
a really nice but basically it was only
3 pounds and it kind of got this out
waterproof bit here
there just is the right in there but I
really like this like only if I'll go
out in it a lot but for pictures and
stuff I just really fell in love with it
and I've always wanted a baseball cap
like this and I have one but it doesn't
really fit my head that well I would
pretty big head I'm not gonna lie
anybody who has met me
all I heard me will probably be able to
tell that but yeah I just really like
this hat the 3 pounds and is really rare
that be able to find a hat like this for
3 pounds but I was in forever 21 in
Amsterdam and they were like 15 quid for
a hat like this so go to Primark the
next thing I got is a new handbag and
I'm super excited about this because I
wanted one I saw many new look for
double the price but I just kind of like
held out I was like naina Sega don't
mind in the bag yet you don't need one
but then I walked into Primark and I saw
this and I knew I had to buy it
I found these a really controversial but
it's basically one of these velvet
backpacks
now I personally love these so much
I know they're going to be a bit of a
pain if it rains but I basically got
these four more summer days I definitely
know it's going to be hot it's all lined
with pastel pink interior and it's got a
big pocket then the phone pocket it's
got a little pocket here and then the
back is just like this black lettering
material with black handles I love this
so much it was only nine pounds which is
a pretty good bargain for a bag like
this it just has a gold zipper detailing
and that is my phone the only thing that
worries me about this is I might not be
able to fit everything in it but I think
I will be able to my purse will just fit
in it
but yet I'm really excited to start
using this so I would definitely go and
get Auburn Primark they've got a load of
different colors but personally I just
love the kind of velvety pink color but
that's one your bag I never picked up
some sunglasses because I love prymaat
sunglasses they're so good so the first
pair of picked up are these now these
look like normal glasses but it says
they're UV protected so I don't really
know these are but basically I've got
these for pictures because they were
only a pound and everybody has them at
the moment and I've really wanted a pair
but like from a sauce they were like
ridiculous prices like 15 16 pounds
whereas at Primark a pound that was my
phone again
but yeah I just really like these and
like I don't know how well they suit me
but I just really like them like even if
I just wear them for pictures I thought
they were really cheap for a pound so
yeah I just got these as a little kind
of accessory even to wear my top or
something but for a pound you can't
really say no and then I've got to
imagine like proper sunglasses I am
gonna wear and these are two pounds and
this is like these pink rose gold effect
cat eye sunglasses and product again
prymaat sunglasses are some of the best
you can get like I feel like they're
doing really good juice from Topshop
sunglasses I can't get a sticker off
I haven't actually tried these on
without the label but oh everything is
gone like silver and I cannot even
explain how much these are like blocks
the light out these are so good and
they're so nice as well I'm literally
wearing these all summer I love these
guys you need to go to prime I can get
prime box and glasses I've done these
are so good I then have some things from
the beauty section so I personally
love the Primark PS range I think it's
really good and affordable but
especially the nails I literally I will
glue the nails on and they will last me
up to two weeks no lie and it's so much
cheaper than going to get them done so I
basically picked up two new pairs and
these are they like pointed stiletto
ones which I've never had before I
usually just have the rounded ones so
these are going to be new to try but I'm
super excited so I've got these matte
white ones which were called snowdrop
and he says you get 24 nails I usually
get about 2 sets out of them and then I
got this set which is more like shiny
and it's called stone cold so I've got
quite neutral shades because I don't
want to have to look out their nails for
school and stuff but I really really
like these and they're literally a pound
box you can't get fake nails any cheaper
than that
I'm so sorry that's my phone again but
yet my basically picked up some faint
nails and I'm super excited to try these
the last thing I picked up is from the
home section and I wasn't actually going
to get this but I just really liked it
and I don't really know why born
experienced they don't really need it
but basically it's just this little like
cactus print and it's just got this
picture of the characters in it with
some like gold detailing and I thought
this would be quite nice just to put on
my wall somewhere because my balls like
they're not playing but like there's
areas where they need a bit of so I
bought this to put on my wall and this
is only four pound which I thought was
really good but yeah that is basically
the end of my Primark haul I really hope
you enjoyed it if you want to see more

go to Primark so often but I just never
buy enough in one trip to do a Primark
