today's video
as you can see I'm doing another testing
video and today I'm gonna be testing out
pry marks brand new makeup Primark are
bringing out soma killer droops at the
moment and I'm seeing loads of videos
circling around YouTube and a lot of
people have said to me Anna we want to
know your opinion so I went to Primark I
bought some of the new makeup and today
I'm going to be testing it for you these
are the finished looks if you want to
see what products are used and tested
then carry on watching and other than
that I hope you enjoy and let's get
started I I'm just gonna jump straight
in to this a testing video I'm very
excited because I've done a few at
Primark testing videos before and I
really enjoyed doing them so I thought I
would do another Primark one so I've got
really good dupes here and so they're
brand new makeup and I'm just gonna try
it out for you guys so let's jump into
the first thing so as you probably
noticed I've already got my eyebrows
filled in and I've already got my
foundation that concealer and powder on
and I didn't want to test all of those
products again because I've tested them
before and I just feel like it would be
a bit of a waste of time and I've done
it already so I've just got my normal
foundation on from the drugstore which
is the l'oreal one and i've just done in
my eyebrows using a freedom brow pomade
so again still very affordable products
the first thing that I'm really excited
to use is this set here and this is the
PS nude set it's a highlight and contour
kit so you get the cream contour stick
the little like blender brush thing you
get the brow highlight and then you get
the cream a highlighter duo so obviously
as you want to be able to see this is a
dupe for the Kim Kardashian makeup that
came out I don't actually have the Kim
Kardashian stuff it was just so
expensive and I just didn't think I'd
really use it that much because I never
really use cream contour anyway
but I'm really wanted to give it a go as
it looked very different so that's what
I'm gonna try today I'm gonna open this
up and test it all so please excuse my
hair we've just shoved it out of the way
because I know everybody gets so annoyed
if you have your hair down in test
videos so I know I'm looking a little
bit you know but for the videos where
you open it up you just see this little
plastic tray here and I'm gonna get the
brush out first the stretch feels quite
soft actually and the hair doesn't feel
too too
hey like it feels quite soft I don't
know how good it'll be at blending but
it feels quite nice
and again the sponge is quite soft as
well so that's a cute little brush we're
going to go in with the contour first
and I just want to create to rate the
fact that I've never done cream contour
before so if I'm doing this wrong please
don't say it because I probably know I
am so it's double sided and you just
twist it up like a lipstick there's
really not that much product in here and
if I just undo the next one this one's
just a little bit light isn't writer or
are they exactly saying well maybe it's
darker I can't tell you don't actually
get that much product but the kit was
only 8 pounds so I'm not expecting to
get a ton of product what I'm going to
do is I'm gonna put it down a little bit
so it doesn't snap on me and I'm just
gonna put it where I think it needs to
go and then we're going to blend it
using the sponge I'm just gonna draw it
onto my face in the areas I think it
needs to I think this is actually a
little bit dark for me maybe I should
cream contour more should I help my nose
i risky that's definitely gonna give me
a foundation right I will just put a
tiny bit on my nose as well just so we
could say I at least tried it I'm then
going to take this sponge and I'm gonna
start to blend it in to my skin this is
really really hard to blend but it might
give me an OK finish everybody says
cream contours are actually better a
normal contour so maybe I should
actually try it the contour seems to be
blending out ok I think it's just the
brush it's gonna blend it alongside of
my nose definitely needed a more precise
blender for the side of my nose because
now my nose just looks extremely red and
like I've rubbed all the makeup off of
it I think I prefer powder but that's
just because I find it easier to apply
but I feel like this actually gives me a
little bit more of a natural look and
especially when I'm blending it like
really hard it just seems to not spread
too far as well which I like there's my
face all contoured up as you can see
it's quite natural it's not really a lot
of color at all which I actually quite
liked already it's nice I actually quite
liked that because I wouldn't want it to
be loads of color the only thing I
little bit annoyed about is my nose
because a lot
makeups now come off and I'm just gonna
have to go over that and blend it with a
normal view tea blender because that
sponge just isn't fit for nose
contouring I needed a really precise
brush I've then got a Simic cream
highlighters to try out so this one is
definitely more orange and then this one
is definitely more white so I'm just
gonna try this on at my cheap buy I know
a lot of people put it down here as well
and also under their eyes maybe I should
try that today I'm just gonna pop it on
top of my cheeks this is a really really
shimmery shade I'm gonna use the soft
side of the brush just to dab this on
and you know what that's actually a
really pretty subtle highlight is not
too in-your-face it's not too blinding
but it doesn't feel sticky either it
should feel like it's blended into my
skin I'm just gonna pop a little bit on
the end of my nose and then just blend
that out as well and like I said it's
just a really really natural finish so
actually this little contour kit also
come to the brow highlight as well which
I'm gonna try it's really really good
for eight pounds and obviously I haven't
tried the Kim Kardashian one but I'm
sure it's probably no better than this
I'm sure they exactly the same the brow
highlight is so nice it's like really
pretty and white or then my eyebrows are
a little bit messy the moment it might
not do it justice I've just popped some
of that on my brow bone and I'm just
blending that in I'm also gonna pop some
in I'm right in a corner because I'm a
sucker for inner corner highlight and
even though I'm gonna be testing eye
shadow still love it
that's really really pretty so honestly
overall for this little kit here for
eight pounds I'm definitely gonna give
that a thumbs up I think Primark I've
done really really well there and I've
actually kind of tempted to use the
contour and start cream contouring let
me know what you guys think down below
but I'm actually kinda tempted I do have
a highlighting palette to try out but
first of all I'm gonna go on it two eyes
shadow so I thought this is really cool
and as you know Mac kind of have this
like make yourself palette thing that
you can do and you can buy the
eyeshadows and they're quite expensive I
think they're actually eight to ten
pounds per pan but in Primark I bought
this and this was two pounds and it's
got a space of four eyeshadows and then
the eyeshadows are 60 P each this one is
the shade earth then I got the shade
bone and that also got the shade and
light and then baked and
I try to make them quite brown and gold
as I thought kind of made you like a
brown look today but in total the
palette was 2 pounds and these cost me
to pound 40 so 4 pounds 44 4 eyeshadows
now obviously I don't know the
pigmentation of them yet but that's so
much better
and it literally does look like math
I've just popped all four of the
eyeshadows in the palette and they look
really really pretty and this definitely
looks more expensive than 4 pounds 40 so
I'm gonna start off with this brownie
orange shades here and I'm gonna run
this all on the crease then I'm gonna
pop this in the outer corner and then
inner corner highlight with this and
then pop that on my lid one thing I
thought was actually quite good was I
had quite a big shade range and there's
quite a lot to choose from which is
obviously so good because then you can
make loads of different right looks up
as a first impression this is actually
quite pigmented like honestly this is
the same pigmentation as this naked
urban decay petite palette that I'm
holding here and probably the same
pigmentation as the macro is actually
and at the moment it's actually no
fallout with this color which is really
good and it's pure matte so honestly so
far these are getting a thumbs-up
literally for 60 pH I believe this now
we're gonna go in with the darker
perfectly brown shade and I'm just gonna
pop this in at the outer corner this
shade isn't as pigmented as it probably
would appear to be you'd think this
would be really dark and really daring
although it's actually quite faint gray
color and then again I'm scaring the
exact same on the other eye as it showed
isn't as pigmented I'm just gonna keep
building it up but honestly for 60p you
really can't complain because the
pigmentation is really good for that
price point I'm now just gonna take the
gold glitter shade and I have a feeling
this one is gonna be quite pigmented and
I'm just gonna pop that or along my lid
what oh my god
this shade is pure gold okay I'm
actually shook oh my gosh Wow okay I'm
not even just saying this this is the
most pigmented gold eyeshadow I've ever
used that is actually so so beautiful
and you don't even need two layers like
one layer and that is so strongly
pigmented I have I'm fully sure you
need to get this shade from primark if
you haven't already
this was the shade and the light I've
been looking for a pigmented gold I
should have liked this for so long and I
definitely didn't think Primark would be
the place I found one he's proving me
wrong
Primark has been the place and you guys
need to get down there and get this
because 60p couldn't be more well-spent
now I know how pigmented that shade is
I'm just gonna go back in with the
brownie colour and I'm just gonna darken
it up a little bit more and just blend
them together as I really didn't expect
that to be so pigmented to prime my
eyelashes at before I do lashes I'm
gonna be using this mascara and this is
the PS amplified definition of volume
lift mascara and this was 2 pounds it
just looks a bit like a L'Oreal mascara
really and I thought it would be quite
good one to try out as I've actually
never seen this before although it's got
the really annoying plastic packaging
around it just to update you I've been
trying to get this open for the past 10
minutes I've stabbed myself about 10
times with the scissors and as you
cannot get it undone so I'm not gonna be
able to test this but if you can get it
undone please let me know your opinions
on it I'm literally gonna have to get a
really sharp object on this thing
because they st. coming open for lashes
I'm gonna use the gwa girls with
attitude lashes you can buy this in
Primark for about 3 pounds I'm gonna be
using the luxe silk effects lashes and I
think that's essentially what they're
called and they're just in this style
here not going to do eyeliner we're just
going to go straight in with lashes and
then I will be back to test the
highlights and the lips the eye shadows
on my eyes and I actually love this look
so much it's so simple because it's
literally a mixture of basically two
colours because you can't even see the
brown anymore and it's so so pretty I
also dragged underneath my eye and then
just added a little bit of bottle lash
mascara and obviously in my lashes as
well and it just looks so good I'm so
happy with this and in total it's cost
like what less than a fiver for
everything that I've used now I'm gonna
go on it to highlight so obviously I've
highlighted one side already by I'm
gonna go over it because I've got this
and there's EPS glow palette highlight
expand sculpt cheek palette and it's all
glittery as you can see it doesn't feel
like glittery its got like a smooth seal
over it there is four shades in here I'm
definitely not gonna be able to use
these two but I'm gonna try and make
sure the
- and I'm gonna use this one from Real
Techniques and I'm just gonna dab it in
the highlighter all this looks quite
pigmented actually oh hello oh my gosh
this is a dupe of the anastasia beverly
hills palette by the way what on earth
that shade is blinding I'm gonna go over
on the other side though because these
powder hunters are definitely stronger
obviously we also need some on the end
of my nose I'm just gonna use the whiter
shade and then on my Cupid's bow as well
finally a full lipstick I'm gonna be
testing out one of the brand new nude
shade and this is a nude matte lipstick
and it's like a light pink shade
it's called uncovered and all this is a
different shade actually alright picks
up a shade earlier and it was called
birthday suit so oh this is so pretty
though
this is a very very new shade it might
not suit the eyes but I just wanted to
test it for you as obviously this looks
a lot like a matte lipstick but for like
literally 15 quid less it was one pound
fifty it's super pigmented and super
super nude but it's not sheer at all
that's the only bottom lip and as you
can see it is really really need but
it's a really nice color I've never
really worn a shade like this before and
I've never really done a look like this
but honestly it's so pretty and this
cost me less than 20 pounds so that is
the end of this video I really hope you
guys have enjoyed ear as you can see try
not have it killed the game with this
makeup and I'm literally feeling it so
much thank you so much for watching I
really hope you enjoyed if you did smash
a huge thumbs up let me know down below
what you think in the comments and let
me know if you're going to try any of
the Primark makeup because I honestly
think you should like the highlight is
the lips the lashes that the gold
eyeshadow like everything is so good I
love you all so much and I will see you
very soon for a brand new video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
