today's video I am going to be doing a
very exciting Primark haul first one or
2018 I went on a little twat splurge and
I'm pretty happy with myself because I
think I found a really good bargain and
I'm absolutely buzzing to show you guys
what I found because I know you love
Prime articles just as much as I love
Primark also I thought what better way
to start off the January well kind of
finish January with a prime article this
video is also in that collaboration it
with 21 buttons which is an amazing app
which I actually spoke about as well in
my previous Primark haul so if you guys
haven't heard of 21 buttons it's
basically an amazing app where you can
get inspired by other influences outfit
ideas it's really cool because you can
discover the brand that your favorite
influencers are wearing just by clicking
at the little circle which the
influencer would have tagged on for
instance their jumper and it would take
you to the direct link as to where you
can buy it from and it's really cool as
well because you can save items in your
wardrobe and then you can discover a
different way to style items in the
combine feature which i think is so so
cool and of course it's not only just
for your own outfit so you can also just
use the app for style inspiration I know
I use it when I'm feeling a bit
uninspired I'm like I don't really know
what type of clothes I want to go for
what clothes I want to order and when
you go into this app there's so much
inspiration and I cannot even tell you
how handy is just to have the link
directly there to take you directly to
the website there's also exclusive
images of your favorite influencers on
there where you won't see on any other
social media platforms so it's a really
good app for that as well I will leave
the link down below to my 21 buttons
profile my username is slaw princess and
I really hope you guys go follow me over
there because I do post quite a lot of
my outfits and you guys really really
like to see where I get them from so
definitely go follow it link it in the
description box down below other than
that I think we should just get straight
on into the Primark haul because I don't
know about you but I love for a mark so
I was really weirded out because I spent
quite a bit of money and I bought quite
a lot of stuff and the women decided to
pack
really really small bag I was like okay
like if the bag wants to break it will
break but I was like okay so I'm just
going to go in really and just pull out
the first thing that I see which is a
pair of jammers because they were in the
sale and it was a good bargain I didn't
even see these but these are like I
don't know what you call them like maybe
like a paisley print bottoms and then
just a cream top these were knocked down
to two pounds from nine pounds I was
like that's an absolute bargain because
I thought that these are quite
spring-like as well so they're kind of
like a fresh feel for the new year and
even though they're kind of falling off
the cardboard which might be why they
were also a bit on sale but anyway I
think it's very nice and it basically
just says stretch top and leg so I don't
really excited to wear these and for two
pounds I'm like I'm sorry where can you
go wrong to pound dollars I'd like a
pound per item like I wouldn't buy
probably wouldn't pay 9 pounds for them
but 2 pounds straight my basket the next
thing I'm absolutely obsessed with and
I'm pretty sure you guys would have seen
everywhere that a lot of people are
wearing the Gucci belt and it's so nice
it's like amazing I love it so much and
probably Mike came out with your most
amazing group of it obviously doesn't
have the G's but it looks exactly like
it like exact if you like it it's just a
black belt like this and it basically
has just got the two kind of gold oh
really
and it just upside the future like if I
saw something in the street wearing this
I'm like oh my god that's such a good
Joop and they also do like a miniature
one as well with two miniature rings
which I think I do actually have it but
I don't know where it's gone but I was
gonna buy another one but I thought the
big one was kind of cool I really like
it and it basically has just got like
this little button thing on the back of
it just like the Gucci one as well and
the only difference is this one was four
pounds you're saving yourself about 300
pounds here so basically I would go over
to Primark and pick yourself at one of
these because absolute bargain the next
thing I picked up was a bit random
really and it's just because I'm always
always running low on these and
basically I score myself some ankle
socks I'm that one person that is like
kind of are some socks do you have any
something I'm borrowing because I always
lose my socks like I don't know where
they go they have an underwear box I
just can't find them so
I tracked myself to a two pound pack of
seven pairs of Shula nur's and I'm um
fully stocked up now like fully stocked
up but Primark stocks are really good
and they're really cheap and affordable
as well like seven pairs of socks for
two pounds it's a very good deal the
next thing that I bought is some jogging
bottom because I really wanted something
comfy that I could wear but I feel very
cozy in that I just kind of like be able
to relax in and I found this pair of
doggy bottoms at eight pounds and they
have got a black waistband and they're
kind of like this gray actually color
and then there's just like a thick
cotton material really and they just go
all the way down and then at the bottom
and they've got some black cuffs and
then on the side it's also got like
black cuffs I'm gonna do a try and clip
so you guys would be able to see
properly but I just thought this would
be really comfy because I do a lot of
traveling and everything like that so I
thought these would be really cool to
buy plus I don't actually own a pair
join bottoms I don't think I've got some
pink ones but they're kind of like a
jogger set Jarmo set but I don't
actually own an all page on your bottom
so I'm very happy I do now and these
were only eight pounds as well which i
think is a really good price for these
next diving on in to my bag I got
another pair of trousers and I'm fully
obsessed with these I think these are
amazing so they feel like they're called
collapse if they're not sorry but I
think they might be so they're these
like musters at color trousers and
they've got like this tight waistband
here how about you try these also don't
if they can fit me but they were ten
pounds and I just think they're so
gorgeous they've got this little bow
here
and they're basically just like big
flowy flared trousers but they don't go
all the way down to the bottom there
like cropped I just saw these on like
the mannequin as I was walking past a
shop and I said to my mum incidentally I
was like I want those they are so nice
so I just picked these up I think
they're really pretty very spring-like
and the colors are very like colourful
the color is really bright which I like
and I don't really wear a lot of bright
clothes I tend to stick to very
monochrome colors so I thought this was
really really pretty and I also bought a
top that could match it so I bought this
gray top and I thought this is a really
good handy piece to having a wardrobe
that kind of pairs in everything so
you've always got a top so you know you
can wear and it was six pounds I got it
in a bit of a bigger size to what I am
because mum said that it would probably
shrink and it probably failed to be fair
and
this gray kind of it's not knitted but
it's got the kind of knitted print on it
and his t-shirt
it's long-sleeved and it's kind of got a
little bit of a high neck not really but
I'm like a tiny bit and it's gonna be
dead skin tight because you can tell by
the material it's quite stretchy but
this tucked in to this I think might be
quite a nice look and these were six
pounds so I thought that was a really
good price and I really liked it I then
actually decided to venture out and I
actually decided to get it in black too
because you never know like I said when
you're going to need a plain colored
t-shirt they're like I don't know if
you're wearing two trousers you're like
I have no teachers that go with this now
you do so again this was six pounds and
the same side same stretchy material
same pattern I just thought it was very
pretty and again I guess it could go
with the trousers maybe the black
actually goes more than the gray now I'm
looking at it
but they had these in loads of different
colors they had them in baby pink baby
blue I think I saw they had a white one
as well so really good amount of colors
and the six pounds I think you get an
absolute bargain there because obviously
I meant for the monochrome colors but
you can get some really pretty spring
colors this next thing like I think is
so cool and I bought this a lot of
months in advance
so obviously it's gonna be like festival
season in like July August time and I've
been tickets to Wireless so I won't like
start kind of buying little things here
and there and I saw this really cool bum
bag but I've got a lot of people are
gonna have it so I'm gonna wait for one
of the days but I think it's really cool
so is this pink material is got the gold
tip and then on the thing it says not
interested and I just think that set the
whole bag off so nice and that just
around my waist I think it's gonna be
super super pretty I've never actually
owned a bun back before so I just saw it
and they also had in car key and I was
like yeah that's really cool amongst
then it was really cool as well so I
thought I would buy that and I think
this was six pounds which is a bargain
because I feel like you're either gonna
lose it or it's gonna get really dirty
so four six pounds I think that's really
good so I'm very very happy with that
purchase I then also picked up two
things from the home section because I
love Primark home section it's a May
saying I actually picked up that light
there but that was like on a previous
Primark trip but it's eight pounds and
it's got a you can change the brightness
of it it's really really cool so that's
one for mark as well so is that actually
that was two pounds in sale just like
you guys know but I picked up this and
it's kind of like this ceramic candle
holder it's copper here you can put a
tea light here and then around the edge
it's like this stone rock-hard material
it was 2 pounds and I thought that was
really good and I just bought it to go
on my future shelves because I've got
quite a lot of shelves around my room
and I'd like to change them up you know
for the different seasons so for 2
pounds I thought that was really really
nice and I haven't really seen anything
or had anything like this before so yeah
I thought that was really cool and the
last thing they got to end off my
Primark haul is this really cool little
gold cactus I just thought this is
really cute and quirky and I really
liked it and something told me to buy it
and not put it down
it's just ceramic and it's gold and it
was four pounds and it's actually like a
little pot so I guess you could put
flowers in it or something but I thought
like it just looks kind of cool like
this and I might put it over there I'll
put it over there
this so many places I could put it but I
just really liked it so I don't know
absolutely pretty cute quirky so that is
the end of my Primark haul for kind of
late winter early spring 2018 let me

nice stuff I'm really really happy with
