school haul which includes a Primark
haul and my bags and shoes for stuff
that I'm going to be getting for school
so it's mostly a Primark haul because I
did go to Primark by the way it's not in
the Bible emptied it out on Saturday and
I've decided that I'll do prime out cool
as I did pick up quite a few bit to try
and very happy with so if you would like
to see what I got then carry on much so
I'll be probably the most boring thing
and it is just a top so I got a size six
plain white like t-shirt top because I
figured that I would need one of these
bought PE so this is just gonna be a pea
top and size six and it was three pounds
and it's just a my stretch tea again
size six and I will try all these on so
you can see you all overlay videos but
you had to pick this up for three pounds
I then picked up this blue chiffon top
so I wore this in my last video and I
was getting so many compliments on it so
thank you so much and it's just this
blue like really pretty
Shivani top and you obviously have to
wear something underneath it
I just pad like wore a white vest off
underneath it and this is in the sale
for two pounds down for five pounds and
I loved it so much they've got it in
pink too so I got a blue one and I've
got a pink one the pink one's a little
bit more bigger because um they didn't
have the next size down I got size six
in that and then I got size telling this
but they still fit really nice and I
really really like these tops again I'll
try them all along but I absolutely love
these and these are two pounds each so
four pounds which is amazing next thing
I decided to pick up with some socks
because I figured that I need some socks
of PE so I just picked up these seven
pairs of shoes liners socks and they're
just like I want to call them trainer
socks yeah I'm just aware with my pee
trainers so I really like these because
they're just plain they were 2 pounds or
7 pairs which i thought was really good
then picked up a makeup bag for school
and this is just a like a mini spotty
makeup bag and it was three pounds and
it's called blush and I was trying like
to find the fat of my name I found it
finally I don't know if I like the Zips
because they have an a on but I like
like the main bag and it's got two
really big pocket
how'd you took the things off anything
but the pockets are really big so I
thought this would be really good for
like keep my makeup in one half and then
like maybe bredrin and sprays in the
other half again this was three pounds
it's just got it's like paint pink
pastel pink with white dots on and then
it golden a and they had like every
single letter so you can always get your
name the next thing I decided to pick up
white sand rings so I actually I'm not
like a huge fan of jewelry and rings
because I don't really wear them like
close like you never really see me
wearing jewelry but then I saw these for
250 and I really really liked them I saw
them like a while ago as well but I just
never picked them up
I do something when I went to see Bailey
McConnell at PETA and then I saw them
again on Saturday and I've had to get
them so I'm not sure how many you get
where you get 12 and they're like a rosy
gold color and they come in all
different shapes and sizes so you can
fit them or different places on your
fingers like here and down here and
stuff and yeah they were 2 pound 54:12
and it's a really big one too tall ones
so I really like this pack and yeah I
really like it
next thing I picked up was a purse so I
really needed a new purse and I've
mentioned that quite a few times in my
what's in my bag which I'll be doing
that dated one off because I just hated
my doctor purse I just didn't like it at
all
and then I saw this one for five pounds
which is kind of expensive but I thought
it was really nice and I actually went
into Primark and I know wanted to get
this purse because I saw it in full
scenes video and then I could only see a
black a gray and a cream version of it
and I was so annoyed because I thought
pastel blue would go really nice with my
pastel pink bag and then I actually
found it hiding underneath like all the
black purses I was really happy I've
actually like put all my money in cards
in and stuff already but ready to take
that off now and then there's like
compartment just there then it's row
gold detailing and then you can fit your
trained there and I just thought it was
really nice and I like the pleated type
pattern yeah I love that the next thing
I picked up while my school shoes now I
am aware prime up shoes don't last ages
but these have some amazing soles on
them so these are them so I know they're
not going to be to everybody's taste but
I really like them because they kind of
remind me like a geeky look which I
really really like
and I thought they match my bag really
nice and these I think ten pounds on any
of the labels on them anymore
no but they were 10 pounds and they're
shiny material and then they've got like
two buckle straps here with gold buckles
and they've got like this really cool
detailing just here and I really like
these for ten pounds I was going to get
Clarke's but then I just saw these and I
fell in love so I had to get them the
formal thing and they thought I'm the
way it wasn't too big but I'm happy with
everything I got
so the final thing in this haul is my
school bag and it's actually from new
look so you can see I haven't even took
the thing off yet but I'm still in the
middle of sorting it out but this is my
bag so it's really really big and it's
black and it has two straps here doesn't
have a long strap but I'm going to be
ordering one and this thing I liked
about this is these side parts because
they're like see-through and I thought
I'd kind of set off the bag and then it
has like gold detailing here and then
the baggage really big inside it's just
done it by a button right I've got all
my school stuff in there which I'm gonna
sort out ready for my what's in my bag
video but this was 20 pounds and I
definitely thought it was worth it
because it was really strong at the
straps and yeah I really liked it I just
fell in love with it as soon as I saw
her I was everything in my whole I know
it wasn't huge but I'm very happy with
everything that I've got so thanks for
watching thumbs up if you enjoyed and

I'm gonna be doing one but I want to
