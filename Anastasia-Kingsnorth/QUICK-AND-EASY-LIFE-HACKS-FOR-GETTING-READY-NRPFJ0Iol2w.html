and I'm going to do a video about beauty
hacks you can use when you are in a rush
or a hurry so I'm super excited for
today's video I've wanted to do a hack
to do for a long time I watch them all
the time they are so handy so I thought
I would you off you're getting ready in
a brush as I know this is something that
a lot of people have to do and a lot of
people struggle with so I'm gonna show
you my tips and hacks that I have for if
you really need to do something that
normally takes a long time and show you
how to basically do it quicker so yeah
without further adieu I'm just gonna go
straight on into the video so I really
hope you enjoy it and let's get start
the first life hack is all about nails
now a nail is concerned my feature for
you because sometimes you don't just
have time to go to the shop and get them
done or you don't really want to wait
for them to dry because when they dry
this much they go everywhere and it's
just really annoying something that I
would definitely use are the brand new
impress manicures these nails produce a
gel like manicure in literally minutes
and they are literally stick on nails
but you don't actually have to use any
glue these new generation of now is user
pawlenty super hold duo layer
adhesive which means you don't actually
need to use any glue and you can just
peel off the back and stick them
straight onto your nail which one saves
so much more time and two just makes it
so much easier and quicker it's got two
layers of adhesive which gives it double
benefits because one on the artificial
nail and then one on the natural nail
which is so good they're ready to
usually if you just peed and apply them
and they are so easy to remove as well
dumb nails are so hard to get rid of but
these are just so easy to take off
you'll get literally zero no damage and
in each pack you get 30 nails 6 accent a
prep pad and a mini file
they're only seven pounds 99 for a pack
and you can purchase them exclusively
out superdrug literally I have so many
packages in here because I am obsessed
with them I love the engrams personally
he's my favorite
so yeah the empresa press-on manicure
best life hack everyone so I decided to
go with the nude set of nails as nude is
actually my favorite color so I started
off by using the enclosed prep pad to
cleanse my natural nails this just makes
them feel really clean and smooth and by
the way yes I have nothing on my nails
they are completely cut filed and clean
from nanny Nell
polish once cleaning or now sizing is
also very important so make sure to lay
out the sizes in order of which you're
gonna put them on your nails to make
easier when applying and then you just
peel off the backing and align the nail
with your cuticle pressing firmly in the
middle then on each side of the nails
and these nails can actually be cut or
filed as well which is amazing now there
are all different sizes and if you're in
doubt but if you're in between sizes
just go smaller I then I applied my
thumb's last and they were ready to go I
literally love these nails so much they
are so simple to put on and they're so
so easy and there's so many different
designs you can choose from as well I
think I have about five or six packs
here but honestly they're literally like
you've just gone to the nail shop and
got your nails done I absolutely
absolutely adore them the next life hack
is it skincare now let's be honest you
don't really have time to do a load of
skincare if you are running late so if
you do need to do some really quickly
just to get a bit of kind of refreshment
back into your skin and just to get some
make a little bit extra into your skin
you could use a sheet mask primer I've
recently released a brand called holler
and glow which I think you can literally
only buy in Primark at the moment and
this one is called unicorns exist and
it's an illuminating face mask
you just pop this onto your face it's
very moisturizing a very liquidy so it
feels like if your skin is quite dry
really does moisturize it I've used
these before in my snap traps if you
guys follow my snapchat as well and they
are so good and really quick and easy to
use they've recommended time is to leave
them on for 10 to 15 minutes but you can
leave off five minutes and it would
still do hopefully just as good as a job
yeah crease it life next life hack it's
all greasy hair which yes I do have
greasy hair right now so if you do not
have time to wash your hair with shampoo
and conditioner which is sometimes
something you don't really have time to
do if you are in a rush and have that
the night before then you're gonna have
a bit of greasy hair so if you don't
have any dry shampoo I've got a really
good hat for you you can use translucent
setting powder as dry shampoo you just
pop a little bit on your root blend it
in and it will literally mattify your
hair till it's all fresh and all clean
and it's so nice because you don't have
to worry about all the spray the dry
shampoo
have any and then you can go out your
hair looks brand-new
except it's not because you're coming it
up baby it's brand-new come on that's
like the best wife I have I literally
love that I decided to use my Laura
Mercier translucent setting powder so I
just took this small wet and wild brush
popped it in the container of the powder
and just literally brushed it onto my
hair as you can see it kind of leaves a
little bit of a powder residue but you
cannot see that after when you're from
far away but you just blend it in rub it
all in and scrunch your hand through it
and amazing you literally have just
washed your hair but you haven't what a
good life hat if you are really in a
rush now when I'm going out with special
a night out I like to look at tans a bit
bronzed and personally for me I'm very
very very pale as you can probably see
so I recently have been using these
Centro PEZ body mist tan it's a bronzing
mist if you could just spray it on and
you can even offer one hour which gives
you kind of a light finish three hours
giving you a dark who I was giving you a
medium just completely up to you and
then you've also got the tan mitt as
well as so many of these Tan mitts but
literally this stuff is incredible it's
an advanced one-hour tan as well so if
you do want to beat and so intro PES is
absolutely incredible my mum actually
used it for a long long time my mum was
like brown all throughout the seasons so
yeah pretty good life hack as you can
see I am very very very pale like I've
said so I really did need to spray tan
so my moment just did this for me as I
found it quite hard so she just sprayed
it on my arms and I did you the rest of
my body but I did that off-camera and
then you just use the mitt to rub this
in honestly when I woke up I had a
shower two hours later because I didn't
genuine you know how dark it was gonna
go and I literally I'm so much Brown it
makes such a difference and it's just a
real nice little confidence booster if
you are quite power you want to be a bit
more tanned especially when you're
wearing a playsuit or a jumpsuit which
may or may not be another hat coming up
very soon but yes I would definitely
recommend this it was so quick and easy
to do and really good if you were in a
rush know my pack if you're in a rush
for outfits now literally outfit
planning it can sometime take weeks
literally you want to look really good
on a night out so having to wear this
isn't
but something that actually could speed
up your time it's just wearing a
one-piece like a playsuit or a jumpsuit
I recently got a playsuit I think it was
from misguided yes I misguided and it's
so much easier than having to pair
together an outfit because you can just
pop it on whips and trainers on and
you're all ready to go and it was
literally just like that so simple yeah
life hack for getting ready wear
one-piece jumpsuit or a place booked so
this is my final outfit and my final
look as you can see I was actually a lot
more tanned as well which was really
nice against the white as I didn't look
as pale this is just from misguided and
I love the overall look but that was
today's video I really hope you enjoyed
it and I really hope it gave you just
some quick and easy life hacks that you
could possibly use if you are running
late on a night out please give the
video a huge thumbs up if you enjoyed
