going to be doing a super quick everyday
get ready with me including my
five-minute nail hack so I really hope
you enjoy talking in my sleep and now
you making myself crazy
wrote it down
it would save me
I keep pushing for 30 keys believe me
bad words
I finally see the plan
open it would save me
then it was time to move on to nails and
so I decided to use the impress press-on
manicure nails which achieve a 1 scepter
manicure in minutes so the packs that I
decided to go for was this one there
basically right at my street you guys
know that I love pink nails the first
step was to select the correct size
nails so I just lined all the nails up
decided which ones were to fit which and
then just line them all up ready to
stick them on these nails are ready to
use peel and apply and container super
hold dual layer adhesive which means no
glue is needed and it is a hassle free
removal once I've chosen all of the
sizes it was time to use step 1 which
was the prep pad so I just ripped this
open and prepped all my nails with this
pad to ensure they were all clean and
ready for the nails to be stuck on each
pack contained 30 nails 6 accent nails
fret pad and a mini file so it's really
amazing and genuinely does achieve a gel
manicure in minutes
once all my nails were prepped and ready
to go I've peeled off the back of the
nail and press it down firmly onto the
nail first of all pressing firmly in the
middle and then onto each side I then
just repeated this process on all of my
fingers and then did my thumb nails last
I absolutely love these nails purely for
the fact that you do create a gel-like
manicure within minutes they're so
beautiful they make my nails and my
fingers look amazing and it basically
just completes my look so that was the
end of today's video I really hope you
guys enjoyed it if you didn't remember
to give it a huge thumbs up here's the
finished look how amazing does it look
just very natural very beautiful and my
nails match my lip color which I love
but yeah I really hope you guys enjoyed
and I will see you next week for a brand
new video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
