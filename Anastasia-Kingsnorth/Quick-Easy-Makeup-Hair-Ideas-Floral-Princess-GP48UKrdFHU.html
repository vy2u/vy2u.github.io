going to be doing a 5 minute makeup and
hair video OCS a tutorial and it kind of
is a tutorial but yeah it's basically a
really quick 5 minute makeup look and
some hairstyles that you can do in under
5 minutes I'm going to do two different
hairstyles one that would be really
suitable for long hair one that wasn't
really good on short hair however
they're both can be used for long and
short hair but just because I know
obviously everybody has different
headings I thought I would do some
hairstyles that would be more
appropriate for different hair lengths
and then I kind of did a coppery
shimmery eye and a nude lip and
digitally took me 4 to 5 minutes it was
so easy so I cannot wait to share with
you so I hope you enjoyed the video and
let's get started to start off my 5
minute makeup look I primed my face with
my gummies pearl primer from benefit
which is amazing if you want a doing
makeup look
I then went in it with my collection
lasting perfection concealer from
collection and then I just popped a bit
of NARS concealer as well underneath my
eyes on top because I needed to add a
bit of extra coverage and as you can see
the coverage is in Sain of these
concealers mixed together so I just used
my Beauty Blender from Real Techniques
to blend all of this together and the
coverage is amazing I cannot tell you
enough like you can see you can see how
amazing it is so yeah I just buff some
of that into my face using my sponge and
then I set it together with my
infallible powder from L'Oreal which is
also an amazing powder I then went in
with my blusher which was the NARS
orgasm blush which is absolutely
beautiful
it's like you can get a Duke from the
drugstore which is sleek rose gold and I
just love it so much so just add a bit
of an extra shimmer and I said I was
going for a new look I added a bit of my
mary-lou manizer on my cheekbones and my
Cupid's bow and my brow bone because how
can you not
to stop my eyes I took a matte white
shade and just pop that all over the lid
it wasn't very pigmented though and then
I went in with a really shimmery copper
this is from the revolution palette and
I cannot get over how pigmented some of
these eyeshadows are like they are
insane and then finally I just took an
angled brush and I blended a little bit
of brown as you can see I put a bit too
much on one eye so yeah I had to blend
it out quite a bit but as I said you
could just do loads of different colors
you could add more you could add less
but I was kind of going for a neutral
look today I then just added a bit more
mary-lou manizer into my inner corner
and then I went in with mascara which
was of course the lash sensational
because this is the best drugstore
mascara if you were looking for a Jeep
of Too Faced better than sex or benefit
roller lash
to tell me to go
and finally for lips I went in with my
MAC lipstick in blankety which is the oh
my god
it's the perfect nude okay it is just
amazing so that icy finish makeup look I
have it on now obviously because I did
just film it and I loved it so much it's
quite natural but the good thing is
about like a five minute makeup look
this only used eight items but hey items
items but obviously you can like change
the colors so if you want to go really
dramatic and just smokey eye you can use
like black and silver or like black and
gray if you want to go kind of neutral
you can use like matte Browns and like
maybe shimmery white it's like it's a
really really good with a five minute
makeup look because you can choose two
colors but those two colors were to tell
you whether your eye makeup it's really
dramatic or that's really nude and
simple I've kind of gone fit in the
middle today because I wasn't feeling
like too dramatic but then I wanted to
make a little bit out there so that's
why I went through like a coppery brown
look the same with the lip as well I
mean if you used a red lip this would
totally like spice it up but I use a new
lip to kind of tone it down so you can
always change up the colors you can use
different items from that palette you
can use a different lipstick it's
completely up to you but that was a 5
minute makeup look with eight items so
now for the hairstyles so the first
hairstyle is a higher se ponytail as you
can see my hair is very greasy but this
works better with this hairstyle so I
just scrape all of my hair up using my
fingers and I push down on my hair to
make it look more messy I'll then just
tie it off with a hair bubble and I'll
push down on it again and pull it really
tight whilst pulling some bits out and
this makes it really messy and then the
second hairstyle this would be perfect
for short hair even though I have long
hair and it will still look great on
long hair but this is a half-up
half-down messy bug i love these type of
hairstyle because they're just so easy
and quick to do and I think this looks
amazing on short hair the greasers is
literally killing me but it happens to
everybody so it's absolutely fine so
again I just took half of my hair and
just scraped it up with my fingers and I
just tied it off with a black hair
bubble at the top again whilst pulling
bits out and making it really messy and
then just twisted the ponytail around
and wrapped it round itself now this
looks absolutely huge and if you want to
leave it like this you can do I think I
look a bit like one of those wind-up
toys you know so I just get some hair
clips and I just pin it down so it's a
bit smaller and so I don't look a bit
crazy but
you're going with a really messy look
don't even bother with the bobby pins
because you know what it looked pretty
good without them so that was at my 5
minute makeup and hair video I really
hope you enjoyed it I was so excited to
film this video and I've no idea why
because I'm kind of like really excited
at the moment and I'm not really sure
why because I have school tomorrow so
it's like oh but so yeah I hope you
enjoyed this video let me know if you
did by giving it a huge thumbs up and
let me know if it was helpful because
you can use this look
former of your going or hair sales were
on the house hairstyles for a party
anything so I hope you're all having a
lovely day and I will see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
