going to be doing an easy and quick
summer hairstyle video so I've been
challenged by Lily from the channel in
May to create my chocolate chips airhead
challenge - this challenge is basically
where I need to create a rainbow hair
tutorial and I decided that I'm going to
do a rainbow on break dip dye starting
from around here downwards I'm then
gonna be showing you it four different
hairstyles that you can do throughout
the summer and then I hate this I'm
really easy to do as well and of course
the tutorial so these are the chop shops
airhead they are basically intense
favorite chewy candy and these are the
fruit ones and you can get all different
colors and they have the apple flavor
blueberry flavored strawberry flavor
orange flavor and lemon flavor so they
are basically the colors I'm going to be
using in this tutorial these sweets are
incredible and I definitely recommend if
you try them because I'm definitely
gonna be each of these throughout the
video so I really hope you enjoy the
video and let's get started so to start
this tutorial your first of all gonna
want to brush your hair and make sure
there's absolutely no knots you then
want to put an old top on or a towel
over your shoulder so you don't get it
on your top and you want to start by
spraying the can onto your hair so you
want to spray like a about two
centimetre thick stripe across your hair
and then shake the can and do the second
color making sure that the second color
overlays the first color by a little bit
so they blend together and they create
an ombre effect so as you can see I went
from purple to blue to green and the
green actually turned a little bit
yellow I then also added some orange and
a bit of red and I thought this looked
amazing honestly my hair felt so good
after this it dried out it was
absolutely perfect and it felt so smooth
after about half an hour so the first
hairstyle is a treatise down a messy
considering I've got rainbow ombre hair
I don't think I need to do too much for
it and this can just complete any outfit
all I did was brush the tops of my hair
and mess them and poof them up and to be
fair I'm gonna wear this load through
the summer because it's so easy to do
and I think it looks the best
the second hairstyle I always get asked
how I do it and it is a low messy
ponytail so all I do is literally pick
up all of my hair from a middle parting
I don't even bother to brush it I
literally just pick it up and then I
literally just put it in a hairball all
those all I do it looks so messy yet
really put together and I can wear this
so much through the summer time and I
definitely recommend you do it because
it's so easy and so simple
the next hairstyle is around the head
plat so all I did was take one side of
my hair and plat it all the way down I
then just secured it with a bubble but I
took the proble out later you don't need
to worry about what color it is or
anything I then basically sweep tip
around the back of my head and Pat it
that's into the other side so I used the
hair on the other side split into two
and put the plat as a third section
I then messed it all up took the bubble
out and there you go it's a plat and
it's really really simple
the final hairstyle is having your hair
all to one side so all I did it was
sweep all my hair around to one side and
then decide where they would basically
no hair
I literally just kind of got it and I
twisted it around and bobby pinned it
this made sure that it stayed in place
but it also gave it a little extra thing
to look out on the side and this looked
so nice so that is the end of my trapper
shops I have challenge and summer easy
and quick hairstyle video I love filming
this I actually love my hair like this I
think you look so cool and very very
different for the summer because you
don't really see many people going
around like this but let me know the
comments if you were going to try it and
let me know if you like the video in the
comments as well I will see you soon bye
