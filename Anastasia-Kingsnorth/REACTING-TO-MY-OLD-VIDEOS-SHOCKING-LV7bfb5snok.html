I'm having a little bit of an
embarrassing one but it's so requested
that I thought you know what I'm just
going to do it today I'm going to be
reacting to my old youtube videos now
recently people have been having served
my old channels from when I was
literally like 12 years old
cut in their recommended and suddenly
the views on that channel absolutely
shot up because loads of people are
watching my old video is now some of you
might not even know I on about because I
never told you guys about the channel
I've spoken about it but I haven't
exactly said what it was so today I'm
gonna be reacting to that channel
there's also a channel which I've never
spoken about before that I'm gonna be
reacting to and basically I haven't
watched these videos in a very very long
time pretty much since I made them
because at the time it was what I loved
but now looking back I'm like oh god I
must have had a lot of confidence to do
that so my mum has made me a playlist
which is on private so sadly you cannot
go and watch it and I am going to be
reacting to these videos so obviously
you know I hope you guys enjoy your I'm
gonna be a little bit embarrassed but
you know what I'm not gonna be ashamed
because is where I come from it's what I
loved at the time and if I didn't do
that then I probably wouldn't be where I
am today making this video so everything
happens for a reason that's what I like
to believe anyway so I really hope you
guys enjoy if you do remember Saturday
huge thumbs up let's see if we can smash
15,000 likes for me put myself on the
line other than that I really hope you
enjoy and let's get started so I've got
my earphone in and we're gonna head on
to YouTube and get the first video up so
how do I get on to like playlists and
stuff the first one is called moshi news
at 10 breaking news and to give you a
little bit of background information on
this video and my channel I used to love
moshi monsters so much like so much to
the point my whole life revolved around
it like my room was moshi my life was
mushy I uploaded a video every day like
opening something or doing something and
it was my life so anyway
I'm just gonna get on into the video cuz
wow I look fetus nice little um video
star effects
I like Janna dr. Strangeglove I still
remember all the names like that's how
obsessed I was who did oh my god yeah I
even have to make this video starve it
in okay even left that in oh I know
what's coming I can remember it oh I'm
so embarrassed
today I bring a shocking story much been
destroyed
but the thing is like how about how much
have I change that I uploaded this video
25 July 2013 so that was five years ago
so I was twelve years old some seventeen
now so I was 12 years old yeah 12 huh I
literally have no words like I have no
words I was just such an imaginative kid
that like that was my way of expressing
myself I know oh my god that still out
I'm using all like the iMovie have been
destroyed I'm talking about myself in
the third person
oh my god I remember now so basically I
did this series on my channel called
washi TV but I did like episodes of
stuff and there's my mum put one of the
yeah my mom was one of the episodes in
the thing okay so that was basically the
first video so now you can kind of get a
gist of how old I was the type of stuff
that I did and basically I just love
life like I love life so much but
looking back like I know it's a little
bit embarrassing and like how much how I
changed and like how much I've come on
and stuff but that is where I came from
and that's what I have to remember the
next one is a vlog and the read I think
my mum put this in here because
obviously I vlog now and I met up with
one of my friends at the time called any
and basically I just look really
different so my makeup even behind but
can you see like how much obsessed I was
like the calendar the shelves like
everything the thing is that you can see
how like under confident I was a little
bit like I wasn't as free with my words
and I was
like straight to the point but my hair
like everything about me I just look
young like that's the thing I looked
young I love like your MA she wanted
everything like they did everything back
then they have the shower gels and
ethnic bath set oh my god epic Bassett I
was so nervous like so so nervous I was
giving people codes there we go I'm on
the way home with the nice black border
I've got I was I was a blogger
oh I was pro that was at one of my blogs
I mean if you want to go watch my vlogs
now you will see how they have greatly
improved the next video is called
Fernando poor and I also used to do
opening like and washi monster figures
and stuff I remember I was so happy
because I had got one of the rarest
figures so I'm gonna skip into the video
a bit because I just talked about the
packet like I remember doing this I
didn't know they made first washing that
we have any path oh my god guys oh my oh
my god I oh my god I can't go I can't go
through myself now at the time I
remember I literally was so excited I
couldn't have been happier and now I'm
like hmm the thing is that I still have
all my fingers like I will never part
with them because of how much they meant
to me at the time and like they still
mean a lot to me like I would never part
with them but basically if that was a
really rare thicker at the time than
barely anybody people found it and I
managed to find one and I was very very
happy the last one I'm going to show you
from this channel is called washi TV
episode 6 hey guys so I'm very excited
personally around the house you're
sleeping oh my god bless my heart
honestly oh my I was just born to do
this I was born to do it
I hadn't way too much time on my hand
remember was that oh my god I just can't
even I remember all the words I meant
everything to it bless my heart I'm
speechless I'm genuine you speak just
like it it's somehow because I am a
little bit embarrassed but I know that
that's where I came from but the time I
enjoyed it so that's just what I have to
go with the next channel I'm gonna be
reacting to is one called Little Miss at
one t1000 that's my birthday and I
called myself
Little Miss God knows why but I'm gonna
be backed into my first and a video on
that channel which was when I was kind
of coming out of moshi and I wanted to
do Beauty but this was before I started
throwing princess Primark haul and I
look so young I remember my mum had took
me into Primark and she gave me ten
pounds I think he was like ten or
fifteen pounds and I managed to get some
stuff that I really wanted for ages and
left me I had like her MUA lipstick on
my little side table because that was
like the only lipstick I had at the time
and like it's crazy how much times have
changed like it's crazy in this video
this was the seventh of July 2013 five
years ago my hair was so brown like
obviously now I've obviously dyed my
hair a lot of people like it looks like
a wake and I'm like well it's not
because my hair is actually this color
on top and I've just I dipped at the end
blonde so it will grow out and I will
eventually have brown hair again but
it's just crazy like I don't know it's
just crazy I bet it looks really pretty
on I remember loving that top that's my
favorite top at the time oh my god bless
me I'm gonna skip into it there oh yeah
I got the duvet oh my god that is the
duvet that gave me my channel name this
is crazy okay so basically I always get
asked why I called my channel floral
princess and to cut a long story short I
had a little sign on my windowsill a
little windowsill that said princess and
I had this duvet here that had a load of
was on mine and and my mum went
downstairs one day and we were having a
chat and I was like I'm not feeling
Little Miss like I want to start a new
channel and they said okay well let's go
up to your room let's think of a new
name and I remember looking at my bed
sheets and I was like I love flowers and
my nan was like well princess sounds
like frugal princess like that's the
Dubey that made this channel I always
gave my honest opinion bless me and it
was always what I wanted to do and I
wasn't obviously as confident then I
wasn't no when there it's good with my
editing but I loved it like I loved it
so that was my first video on there and
then another video that I did when I
think my mum was pregnant at this time
with my little brother Atticus and again
my mum mine am around and I wanted to
film a video where I basically did like
a DIY because at the time bethany mota
was a massive inspiration to me and I
actually like done like a Mad Hatter
outfit but the thing is I put so much
effort into it it just goes to show like
honestly I love this video so much
I made the heart and made the ha
look at me look my honesty we went to a
charity shop we got like the little
things I needed we went to like Tesco I
had that little picture and glue all of
the little pieces or strips down onto
the base and then once you've done that
the middle bit I honestly loved it so
much like I remember when that was in
the middle of our living room floor and
my nan was on the left my mum was on the
right we were all doing it as a family
I love the music I love honestly I
remember editing this video and I was so
happy with it
and now I did the makeup
bless me it didn't really work I
remember thinking and says you don't
look your best
I told you anyway anyway it was at my
bay and you know my shadows were all
that was my foot one of my first mascara
is the Rimmel scandaleyes oh wow
every way lipstick I told you I loved it
honestly like that such a memory for me
I love that video so much so the last
one I'm going to be reacting to is
something on my floor SS channel which I
actually put on private and I added this
to the playlist because I haven't
watched it in ages and it was quite a
few years ago now that it's called DIY
flower crowns I uploaded this on the 8th
of May 2015 so nearly three years ago
and this was a video that I didn't
actually but my channel I don't member
White's I think I remember quite liking
it and I remember me and mum went down
to like the embankment which is near my
house and she helped me like film it and
stuff for anyway like I remember loving
the editing on this so let's have a look
I wanted to edit like American youtubers
so bad and I did all this on my iPad as
well that films there
edited it I've mentioned all those
videos of songs on my iPad and edited on
my iPad another classic eating song
and then we get on to the DIY part I
remember ordering the things off on eBay
and they into like a mr. Krabs bath as
you can see like YouTube was always been
so close to my heart ever since I was
growing up like I started doing my
mocchi channel easy end of 2011
beginning of 2012 and obviously I
suffered a lot of hate for it like after
you can imagine I was some quite
severely badly bullied for it I'm so
glad I carried it on because I wouldn't
be where I am now if I didn't do that so
but that is the end of this video I hope
you guys have enjoyed me reacting into
my old videos and seeing what I used to
look like and what I used to film I
really hope you guys enjoyed if you did
smash a huge thumbs up I would really
appreciate your thumbs up on this video
because you know a little bit
embarrassing I love you always so so so
much and I will see you on Sunday at 10
a.m. at a brand new video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
