today's video I have got a very very
exciting one for you guys and as you can
see I'm not in my normal setup I've
actually got a desk in front of me I'm
sitting on my bed and today I am going
to be attempting to resit my GCSE exams
I ask you guys over on my vlog channel
if you would like to see a video where I
resit some duty of C papers that I did
last year as I did my GCSEs last year in
May and June and obviously as it's the
season for exams I thought this would be
a very appropriate video and some of you
guys might enjoy watching me do it I am
actually going to sit a biology and b1 a
higher paper and then I'm gonna sit a
maths paper now I haven't looked at
these two papers since I got my results
on a results day and then I went back at
them and I was like where did I go wrong
if you do want to see what I got in my
GCSE news I do have a whole video where
I open my GCSE results but in these two
examples I'm sitting now I actually got
a B in both so I got a beer in my
biology one and then on maths I got a
six which is the new grading system I
just thought this video would be really
fun so I really hope you guys did enjoy
and let's just get started I think I'm
gonna be doing is putting on my glasses
because I honestly cannot see a thing
without my glasses and my eyes are
signed to really hurt so even though I
have lashes I'm gonna have to wear them
like really low I have got the test up
in front of me on my laptop and this is
the b1 higher pay for that I know me
sitting first so I'm going to go through
it all and obviously I won't feel me
doing the six mark questions because
they would take me longer but hopefully
you shouldn't take me an hour because
these tests did not take me an hour when
I was actually sitting them and then I
will mark them and I would see if I did
better or any worse or I did the exact
same as I did in my act to DC essay so
I've got my notepad here the first
question is the lungs of a person who
has cystic fibrosis can be blocked weird
it
you curse which is C so I need to
actually get a pair of that works that'd
be a really good start
pen works okay number oh no it doesn't -
the first answer I think it's C explain
my personal assistant fibrosis may have
more lung infections than a person who
does not have cystic fibrosis I mean I
think I remember this one probably don't
isn't it like the mucus get stuck or
like more mucus is produced making it
harder for them to breathe I don't know
I really cannot remember the answers to
these use words from the box complete
the following a sentence a person or
cystic fibrosis may lose weight because
what because enzymes its enzymes I know
that because the enzymes that digest
insoluble food molecules are restricted
from leaving the large intestine
I want to say is the large intestine but
it probably not all I've got a punnett
square okay complete the punnett square
the inheritance of cystic fibrosis when
both parents are heterozygous pay for
cystic fibrosis okay I think I can do
this so it goes I a two big eyes and
then two little eyes this was something
that I saw wetted back when I was
sitting my exams sit my process was
carried is it by the dominant or is it
recessive I think they're both recessive
so I think the percentage that it will
be born with gene is only 25 it's either
25 percent or 75 percent depending if
it's dominant or recessive I'm going to
put 25 percent but honestly I can't
remember question number two is on
infection now which statement about the
graph is correct honestly I really do
not know I'm just gonna take an absolute
guess I'm gonna say it's C but it really
might not be calculate the difference
between the number of people diagnosed
as HIV positive in 2005 and in 2011
no thank you I think I might skip that
suggest a reason for the difference I
don't know like more people more aware
or I don't even like honestly well
describe our HIV can be partial person
to person now oh my gosh I remember this
question was like it just blew up over
Twitter because everybody
was like is it through sex or is it
through human touch I want to say it's
through just human touch I can't
remember but I definitely did write sex
in my exam last year explain why
bacterial infections caused by mrs a
have increased I don't remember this I
just I don't know if this is a 3-mile
question oh my gosh I definitely messed
this up state the term used to describe
organisms that show pollution levels in
air or water oh my gosh
something indicators oh my gosh this is
so annoying oh my god I can I something
indicators I know that calculate the
number of blood worms at a distance of
75 meters along the stream this sentence
on the streets of 75 repeat one repeat
to your p3o calculate the mean number
I'm gonna forgot what it's mean mode
median mean is medians Oh No
yeah I think it's add them all up it's
Adam and Devon hundred artists 30 it's
48 divided by three which is 16 so it's
16 describe what these results show
about the pollution level of the stream
the further oh I know this I've got this
the further along the stream the further
more polluted it gets it's strange how
much actually comes back to you after
you haven't like done it for a while
where do these living organisms can be
used to determine high oxygen levels in
the water of the stream it's not fungi
stoneflies I think it's D we're gonna
form up Oh
explain how you to vacation that can
result in low oxygen levels in the water
in the stream okay so I remember it was
fertilizers into the water they cause
algae to bloom which means the Sun can't
reach the bottom of the seabed or like
the riverbed the plants can't
photosynthesize so let me just put photo
synthesis because the parts can
photosynthesize that means there's no
oxygen levels because plants release
oxygen when they take in carbon dioxide
no taking something I think I got that
right
I assorted eutrophication back in the
day so if I've got that wrong I'm going
to be very annoyed next we've got
natural selection so explain how natural
selection resulted in the different
beaks apes of the
Pinchas this was something again that i
absolutely sweat it I can picture
geographical isolation in my head
some get better resources than others
then they just develop more like better
adaptations some more resources these
finches show speciation due to
development of ring species so I believe
the fittest oh that's what I'm picturing
that that's what I was picturing
survival of the fittest explain why
hybridization also in its classification
of an organism different they can have
like would you call it like different
qualities of two different sets of
animals so you could have like I don't
know I know I mean by chronic sinus
state one sausage etic variation in a
species genetic variation I honestly do
not have a clue what that means I've
completely forgot about that it's only
one mark but it's the one markers that
can describe the main characteristics of
organisms in the kingdom Animalia oh my
gosh I sweated this as well and I just
do not remember in at the kingdom
Animalia do they lay eggs
you don't understand how frustrating
this is because I used to be so good at
biology and I loved it and I'm so
frustrated with myself I forgot this oh
and a homeo therms I think they're homey
a thumbs I want to say my homey I said
no there I don't know the next part is
on drugs calculate the number of
individuals who are daily smokers in
2008 so if there was 20,000 people and
that's 17% 1% is 200 and then that's 200
times by 17 which is 2000 and then 3,400
3,400 that was me doing math really
quickly in my head so it definitely
might not be say one reason why people
made gave up smoking at tobacco because
more the price rose I think I actually
wrote that remark explain how carbon
monoxide affects a person's ability to
exercise I remember that the carbon
monoxide combines with the hemoglobin in
the red blood cell when you're
exercising is something to do with that
I know it's to do with for anything with
the hemoglobin this is a six mark that
I'm gonna go away and I'm gonna do and
then I'll read you guys my answer to
this is the tobacco contains nicotine
which is a drug describe how the four
groups of drugs can affect the human
body so I've just really
rekka many si I've the four groups are
depressant stimulant narcotics and
hallucinogens although don't think
narcotic is one but I don't I can
remember I've heard that depressant slow
reaction time stimulant to more alert
hallucinogen you start to hallucinate
and I don't remember what narcotics do
the last questions on the nervous system
this diagram shows a motor neuron I
remember this Joyner in the Box to the
director travel of the electrical
impulse in the motor neuron it goes that
way so I'm gonna draw yeah that way what
you'd like to label to dendron I don't
think it's D I think I I want to say it
so anyway now in the two parts of the
body that make up the central nervous
system it's the brain and the spinal
cord sensory neurons carry electrical
impulses from oh my gosh I absolutely
sweated this last year I used to go in
order the central nervous system to the
receptor cells or those two effector
cells describe how a synapse is involved
in the conduction of a nerve impulse
what is the sign ups again it's a
synapse where the to me like that's why
I can picture where like the tooth then
drones or whatever they're called like
me that impulse travels over honestly
this is making me so sad I'm actually
just gonna for fun to like go back and
read my biology book and the last six my
question compared the conduction speed
and diameter of these axons to explain
the role of the myelin sheath wow I do
not remember what the myelin sheath is
the name sounds so familiar and I just
don't even think there's a chance of me
being able to do this 6 mark question
now honestly I have not got a clue I'm
going to go away I'm going to add up how
many marks I would have got and then we
can give myself a grade buried in my
laughs I got to be I haven't really done
very one of the six mark questions so I
feel like I might fail this exam I have
just finished counting up the marks and
laughed in my paper so the gray
boundaries to get a C word 26 and then
to get a B you needed to get 39 and I
actually got 36 marks so I'm with three
marks off getting a B which is the grade
that I got last year bear in mind I
didn't attend the last six mark question
I'm
start with three mark question and I
didn't do one of the maths questions so
if I'd have done those I might have
actually got a B or even done better
than I did last year I'm really proud of
that
even though I've liked my answers
weren't as in detail as I wanted them to
I could get my answers on the mark
scheme like they were quite quite easy
on the mark scheme for last year for b1
so that in turn I'm so happy with that
even though I got to see in person I
would've loved to have got to be again
I'm very happy with the fact that a year
down the line I was only three months of
getting the same grade and I can still
remember a fair bit
now I'm gonna attempt to do a mass GCSE
now realistically this is not gonna go
as well as I did last year I do not know
how I got a B because I was in top set
maths but I struggled a lot like a lot I
just couldn't get it my mind didn't
understand algebra and when it did it
was very simple forms of algebra so I
haven't automatic paper for over a year
and kind of like started to be doing it
again so I'm gonna get the last paper up
and we will see how far I can get before
I decide to give up I was actually in
top set Maps like already said and I did
hire paper so I'm doing high paper one
the first question is simplify 2 to the
power of 5 times 2 to the power of 3 and
I think that's gonna be 2 to the power
of 8 circle the reason why these
triangles are congruent because
side is it is a which of these is a
geometric progression I know I did not
get this in last year's paper cause like
what's a geometric progression I'm just
gonna go for the fourth one I used to be
equals 4 to 3 in the ratio circle the
correct statement
I think it's B is 3 over 4 of a right 36
as a product of prime factors give your
answer in index form so 36 and then I'm
gonna do 18 and 2 so twos that and then
we can do 9 and 2 so circle 2 then we
can do 3 and 3 circle those and then if
we want to write it in index form it's
that 3 ^ 2 2 to the power of 2 3 fifths
of a number is 162 it work out the
number if I hundred sixty two is three
fifths so divide 162
by 3 which is 54 and then times that by
five which is
50 which is 270 use 8 kilometers now it
was 5 miles per hour to write formula of
Y in terms of X yeah we can leave that
density equals mass over volume the
volume of solid owes three times the
volume of solid B the density of solid a
weight - what then that the density of
solid a is two times I want to put this
to average speed equals distance over
time oh my god how much do they drilled
that equation into your head if the
distance is haft and the time is doubled
what happens the average speed I mean I
put stays the same it's probably not
solve this simultaneous equation oh my
gosh
I used to love doing these but I
remember last year I solved it wrong and
I don't remember how but I know it
solved it wrong the second equation by
twos that will give me 2x minus 2y
equals 12 then we'll have 2x plus y
equals 18 so the two X's will cancel out
3y equals 30 which means y equals 10 and
x equals one know what notes are X is 4
so that and then if I put that back in
so 2x is 8 and then add Y which is 10 is
18 and then X which is 4 minus y equals
6 that be minus 6 okay I know the
numbers a 10 and 4 but I don't know
where the minus sign goes so I'm just
going with that one right the number six
million five thousand two hundred in
standard form No so minus three x equals
six know how many of these fractions can
you convert to reoccurring decimal and
got a clue babe why Carol the square
root of 12 and 1/4 as an improper
fraction what how did I even do this I'm
literally looking at this this makes me
so sad because I just can't do this I
know at the end of the paper and I got
as far as like question 10 without not
gonna lie like if I proper put my head
down I might be able to do it but okay
I'm gonna go on the light scheme and I'm
gonna see if I got these answers right
that I actually did I can do like simple
like additions like subtractions times
here I'm quite quick at like that type
of math but anything else when it comes
to like algebra and my brain just didn't
click with and triangles as well I like
to sing cos tan brain didn't click with
that
our other questions that I'd done there
was 22 marks available and I managed to
get 16 of them which considering I
haven't actually had to use any of this
maths since like not doing my math GCSE
is pretty good because not gonna lie
they teach you all this math stuff but
that I feel they really should teach you
the more like money side of it and the
more practical side of it because
honestly I have not used sin cos or tan
what I really hope you guys have enjoyed
this video if you did please smash a
huge thumbs up I really enjoyed filming
this and it made me want to like learn
more like I wanna do more biology and
not so much math but I want to do more
biology but thank you so much for
watching I really hope you guys have
enjoyed good luck if you do have your
exams if you sit in your 11 exams or
GCSE exams
I know it's example to use them right
now and I'm seeing all over my timeline
the best thing to do at the end of the
exam well it was best thing for me to do
I wouldn't necessarily recommend doing
it if you start to see well I love
reading the hash tag on Twitter it
actually cracks me up but I love you all
so much and I will see you on Sunday at
10 a.m. for a brand new video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
