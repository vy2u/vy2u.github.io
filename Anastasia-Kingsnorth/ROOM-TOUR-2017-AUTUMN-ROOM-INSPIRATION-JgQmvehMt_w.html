going to be doing a awesome room tour
slash transformation slash inspiration
are you loving the autumn background
I bought some pumpkins I've got some
candles you've got some leaves I don't
want to make it feel cozy for autumn and
I'm going to be doing it so many autumn
videos I've got so many lined up to a
week one on a Wednesday one under Sunday
you guys are in for a treat but for
today's video I thought I would
kickstart it by showing you in my room
at the moment it basically an autumn
room tour but showing you how I've
improved it different things that I've
added different things I've taken away
just to make my room it feel a little
bit more autumn and all and cozy I
really hope you enjoy this video if you
do give it a huge thumbs up and I will
see you at the end of the video so my
room is a little bit messy right now
this is what it looks like and it needs
a little bit of transformation so let's
do this
so up on my wall I currently have a one
that says don't blend in it stand out
and to glam to give a damn and then I
have two more over there but I also have
these two new ones which I wanna put up
this one isn't exactly autumnal but it
matches my cushion and this one is a
little bit more Ottoman all because it's
got the gold so these have somehow got
to go up here and I'm awful at DIY so
so we had a bit of a disaster and this
print fell straight onto my cactus the
poor poor succulent and squash it and
also ruined all these so don't really
know what to do with this might just
take them all out and put the candle on
top because I'm pretty sad no photos are
up we had a little bit of an issue with
the beefiest one it's a little bit too
heavy so I'm gonna have to find the
place for that but those two and these
three you look so cute together I
literally love that palm tree one is so
much I also just kind of decluttered my
shelves a little bit so I moved this
cactus candle into there and just
chucked out all the cactuses and then I
have moved where I've changed that print
over and took this little like wire
house thing out from it it looks a lot
better now it just doesn't look as it
cluttered I just need to sort out my
candle basket so out this shelf and all
my shelves are basically finished this
looks so much better I can't even tell
you guys now it is fairy lights time and
I got these ones at 4-4 pound 99 from
vnm you get 50 I don't know if this is
gonna be enough but my plan is to put
them along up here like I said I read it
now I'm gonna get them up there as well
because that's so far up but you know
what we're gonna try let's do this I do
not know how I'm gonna get my fairy
lights up they're really tall right now
okay I know it was only 50 but this is
but that actually might be the moat like
the perfect length for this let's give
it a shot
how flippin cute do they look like I've
read anything they were going to look
good because I couldn't reach like that
high but oh my god it just adds such a
cozy feeling to my room and even though
like when I'm laying in bed I won't be
able to see them is lit she just looks
so much better like oh my god I
literally want to get them going all the
way around so tempted just to go to the
shop and buy more because they look so
cute
I also saw would be quite nice if I
actually added some real leaves into my
room so I was hoping I was gonna be able
to find some proper brown ones but
apparently I don't have any of my garden
yet so I'm gonna get some of these
yellow one
and then just a normal green ones and to
help my one from Amazon come because
I've ordered some proper like fake one
which I'll leave a link to down below
but I'm gonna have to make do of real
ones for now what a success because how
cute are these yellow ones so I was
gonna have to do green ones but the
yellow one think if it was so much more
autumn and also so excited to put these
in my room yellow leaves to my shelf and
it literally looks so cute and autumn
and all like it's not too much and it's
not too little but obviously I'm gonna
put a fake went in when the fake ones
come but they look so cute for the time
being and here is my room as you can see
it looks and lives a bit more or tunnel
it looks a lot cleaner I am so in love
with it I just I don't know it's
literally like my dream room it's always
how I wanted it to look in the end and
I've worked so hard to get it to this
point so I'm gonna give you guys a
proper room tour show you where
everything is from how I have done my
room like this how where and everything
I got it from that didn't even make
sense I by excited but yeah I'm so
excited for this video so let's just get
into it so this is my bed area and all
of my cushions I didn't want to go to
automaton the cushions
I just kind of wanted to keep it
stirring it just add a few autumn colors
in so the fort back ones are actually
from a Primark they range between 7 and
3 pounds the smallest being to 3 pounds
which is the golden pink one and all of
the others were 7 pounds and then the
one in front which is my new one for
autumn is a very thick memory foam
cushion and it's got a third gold and
2/3 of gray and it's knitted and that's
from HomeSense I love this it just adds
an ottoman or feel to my room because of
the greys and the gold and ties in with
the other colors as well so that's
basically what I've done for my cushions
not too much just something very simple
and very little and we move on to my
bedside cabinet which is from next
that's basically the same as it has been
in every room tour then I've got my
little plant which is from Primark I
love this so much it was 5 pounds and it
she's got some fake succulents in then
I've got a copper lamp which was from
either from being queue or home base one
of them then we move on to my DIY
dressing table and because of my room is
so small I have to have a mirror
and a shelf which are both from Ikea and
then the fairly lights around it are
also from Ikea and guess what the chair
is also from Ikea and then the big print
that says do more of what makes you
Sparkle is from next I love that so much
and be could have the gray in the gold
as well it just adds a bit more of an
ottoman or feel to my room then we have
my window so first of all I've got my
bars which is from Tiger it was only 2
pounds and I love this so much and then
all of my flowers are from either IKEA
which are all the ones down below here
and the big peonies are from home scents
then I've got this kind of potted plant
thing which is from of the range and it
was 15 pounds and then in the corner but
you can actually see it I have got a
circular which my friend Kaitlyn got me
but yeah I absolutely loved it it's just
very floral very flowery think I'm gonna
get some orange flowers to go in here
because that would complete the autumnal
feel but yeah this is basically my
window looking in closer at my dressing
table I've got a pot which is from Ikea
I think which has got my makeup brushes
in a little cactus which is from new
look then I've got a pineapple with
summit cactuses or like a plan in which
is from Primark and then I've got a bath
and Bodyworks pumpkin pecan waffles
candle I love Bath and Body Works so
much it's just so annoying that we can't
order it online to get here if people
say you can but it just doesn't work for
me when I do it and then I've also got
some autumn leaves which I've put around
which I absolutely love because
literally they make it feel so Ottoman
all and the sign that says happiness is
a journey not a destination it's from
bnm and then we've got one of my shelves
that I've done up or autumn annals so
I've got some green Ivy that's going
around the back of it and then I've got
a cactus light which is from new look in
front of that I've got a little marble
triangle which is from Primark with a
photo of me my mum and amber in it and
then I've got a plant which is also from
Ikea
a candle which is from home scent and
then my amazing gold pumpkin which is
from HomeSense although if you did want
to DIY it yourself you actually could
just spray paint a pumpkin and then do
some I'm actually thinking about doing a
DIY room decor videos if you do want to
see one when you can actually buy
pumpkins then please do let me know
because I really want to make some more
but that's one of my most
shelf in my room and then above it I
have a ton of fairy lights which look
super super cute and I love them so much
and as you can see that's just above my
pumpkin I don't know I'm just in love
with it and then just like every other
room tour I have got my memo board I
love my memo board so much as you can
see it's really filled itself up from my
video last year so the point I actually
have no more space and they are
overlaying each other but if you do want
to see this in a closer detail then
check out my vlogging channel but yeah
these are basically just all the
memories that I've made in the past year
with all of my favorite people then on
the other side of my room I actually
don't really have that much space I just
have my wardrobe and my Alex Shores
and then on top of my Alex Shores I've
got IKEA secure plot with some fake
flowers in and IKEA secure plate with
two lipsticks in and then a IKEA candle
holder with a maple cinnamon pancake
bath and Bodyworks candle on it like I
said I cannot really fit much at the end
of this room so I don't really do much
with this side this is the side that
people don't really see but yeah she's
very plain very simple and not very
autumnal at all but obviously I can't
really do much with this so it's just
very plain and then we have all of my
shelves so I recently have done at this
feature wall which you guys have seen
and I've got prints that are from card
Factory and a tiger and then I've got my
shelf which is all tammana with the
leaves on it and then I've got my
YouTube play button I've got some
flowers and cactuses which are from
Tiger and IKEA my polaroid and then I'm
moving on up here and down here as well
I've got more photos which are from at
the card Factory and then I've got
another print which is from oh my gosh
where is that one from that one from
home since then I've just got some more
candles some more cactuses and these are
all from places like IKEA Tiger
everywhere like that I love my shelves
so much they just give me such an
automaton feel and the leaves just add
something so cute to it the fact that
they're yellow but yeah I absolutely
love this and if you do want to find any
of this I will try and link as much of
it as I can down it's basically
everything I've done with my room I love
it so much it just looks Ottoman all and
just the perfect kind of thing for me so
I'm very happy with it and I hope
guys like to and maybe take some
inspiration from it but yeah I know I'm
just so in love with it and being in
here it makes me so happy especially
because it was very inexpensive to do
there from very inexpensive places like
IKEA Tiger card factory which makes it
even better and my little pumpkin up
there love you guys the end of this
video I really hope you enjoyed it let

thumbs up comment down below what you're
most excited for in autumn and I will
