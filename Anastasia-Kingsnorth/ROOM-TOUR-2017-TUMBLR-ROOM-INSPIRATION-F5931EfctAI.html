back and I we are doing at my updated
room tour for 2017 so happy new year is
fine 2017 I genuinely cannot believe
that this is a brand new year I'm
turning 17 this year which blows my mind
because I still feel like 13 at heart so
yeah I thought I would kick start off
the year with a new room tour because so
many of you guys asked for an updated
one there has been so many new additions
to my room since I last did what I would
try to leave with maybe back in May last
year so it's been a decent amount of
time since I've done one and yeah as I
said there's been a lot of new additions
which you guys always ask where they're
from so today I thought I would film an
updated one as per usual the layout of
my room is always going to be the same
just because I haven't moved house yet
so I bet the little brother can have a
room so because my room is so small I
can't change the layout of it but all of
the bits and bobs in it are basically
new so yeah I really hope you enjoyed
this video and let's get started so as
you walk into my room this is kind of
what you see you basically just see my
bed and my dressing table because as I
said this is basically the size of my
room it's absolutely tiny it's a little
bit of like a rectangular shape so
there's not really much in it and so I
have quite a lot up on my walls
but yeah this is what you see when you
first walk in and I do really love my
room I think so I'm trying to get it
very tumblr and yeah we hope I have
achieved that but this is basically what
you see when you walk in so this is my
bed my bed is from next I've had it
absolutely years this is literally my
bed I had when I was 3 or 4 so I don't
think next we're going to do it anymore
I got it back in like 2003 but yeah my
bed is from next and then I just have a
plain white duvet cover on my bed I like
to keep it very simple as my room is
very small so I don't want to over do it
in patterns and then I just have some
two pillows from Primark these are just
two white throw cushions then in front
of that I have a gold pillow which is
also from Primark and then a floral
cushion that says be unique which again
gives boats from Primark then at the
other end of my bed I also have some
other throw cushions so again all of
these are from Primark apart from the
one with the arrows on which is from new
look I have to say the favorite one is
probably the cactus one because this was
only three
pound and it's so effective and it just
has a bit of a pop of color to my bed
and then I have two blankets again which
of both in Primark because the bottom
one is a plain pink one with your little
bubbles on the end which is from the
gabriella range at Primark and then the
other one is a white and gold geometric
one which it's definitely my all-time
favorite blanket ever this is literally
all I wanted in a blanket and when I
walked into Primark and so they had it
for 11 pounds I literally could not
resist I then have my bedside table so
my actual table is from I think it's
from Argos but I've had this for many
years as my aunty gave it to me in way
back in probably 2005-2006 so I doubt
that you'll be able to get that anymore
again and then I have on top of that a
copper lamp which is from being Q I
think and I really do love this lamp
it's so beautiful and it's just his
copper table lamp
I don't actually have a bulb in it
because it ran out yesterday but I'm
going to put a new one in today as I
would have showed you it then in front
of that I just have a mini bath and
Bodyworks a candle in cinnamon sugar
donor and this is in a mason jar and
I've got this one I was in America and
then I just have a white plant pot with
this green plant in from Ikea you'll
probably notice that a lot of things in
my room are either from Primark or IKEA
because those are like the prime to
places in England to get home when we go
to my dressing table so I absolutely
love my dressing table it is homemade I
made it from a shelf which I got from
Ikea and a mirror which I've got from
the range and then I just popped some
fairly lights around it which I also got
from Ikea as I said my room is way too
small to ever fit a proper dressing
table in it so this was the best that I
could do but it kind of feels like a
Hollywood dressing room table if that
makes any sense so I'm kind of loving it
so on top of that I have my makeup brush
holder which I'm going to go way more
into depth about in my makeup collection
which is coming out in a few weeks as
I've never really gone through my brush
pot but I do have a lot of brushes so I
will go through that then and then next
to that I have this little gold
pineapple candle which is also from
Primark and then I just have two candles
burning but I don't always keep those
there but and what got me them for my
birthday and my mum also got me one for
Christmas then behind now I have this
pink mocha which is from Ikea which has
some flowers in there also from Ikea and
then behind that I have a sign that says
happiness is a journey
not a destination and this was for being
in bargained and then in front of that I
have a bath and Bodyworks candle which
I've got a game Ross in America I
literally live for bath of body wax
candles I'm so sad that they don't do
them over here moving up from this I
have a white wicker heart and this is
gonna be an embargo this was about 10
pounds in sale it's absolutely huge it
really was worth the money and it fits
my room perfect then as you go onto my
windowsill I just have this vast which
has like these tumblr eye prints on them
and this is from tiger and it was only
two pounds which was such a bargain and
then he friended that I had this cute
little white and copper Lantern which is
from new look and I believe this was
eight pound on the other side of my
windowsill I have this white and gold
chevron candle which is from Primark I
think and then behind that I have this
wire copper a with my friend Kaitlyn got
me for hitting 100,000 subscribers so
thank you so much Kaitlyn I literally
have had this in my room ever since and
I adore we then move on to my absolute
favorite part of my room and this is my
absolutely huge wire memo board so I got
this around last year and I actually
made it I mean in a DIY video which I
will link down below and on the screen
now because I get so many questions
about where this is from but I basically
put all of my memories on here so I have
tickets Polaroids photos and it all just
random memories from places that I've
been and this has been completely from
2016 this is basically a showcase of my
life to show that I've lived and it
definitely been one of the best things
I've ever added to my room it makes me
so happy when I look at it and it just
has all of my favorite people on so yeah
this is basically in my memory board I'm
literally in love with this and this is
most definitely the favorite part of my
room we then move on to the part of my
room with people never really see and
this is basically my filming setup as in
where I put my camera and my light so I
just have my wardrobe next to my memo
board and the next type of wardrobe I
have my Alex Joss which is where I store
all of my makeup I'm not going to go
into depth about what I have on top of
my Alex jaws or what's in them because I
am redoing an updated makeup collection
so I'm not even going to bother showing
you what's in there so you're gonna have
to wait a few weeks to find out what is
in all of those nine drawers but yeah
this is basically the other side of my
room which
people don't really see much the
alligaroos are from Ikea and then the
Wardrobe is from next but again I've had
the Wardrobe all my life so I doubt
you'll be able to still find it we then
move on to my shelves so these two
shelves I'm about to show you on the
side on the wall that is my bed is
leaning on if that makes sense then the
other shelf is above my dressing table
so first of all I have this little
copper wire lamp from Primark in front
of that I have a plant which is from new
look and then in front of that I have a
candle which is basically a cactus shape
and I show you this in last week's haul
and it's from Primark then I have a peg
which is from Primark two little stones
which I got from a local garden center
but I'm pretty sure you can find them
basically any garden center I then have
this gold copper glass box which I got
from H&amp;amp;M home a while back but if I can
find one similar I'll link it down below
I then have this golden palm leaf which
again I showed in last week's haul which
is from Primark and then I have one of
Zoe's gold plant pots which is from
boots but she actually gave me this when
I went to these two other apartment and
then inside of that I have the whatnot
das a plant from new look but it also
already had like a copper pot on it but
I thought it looks better in this pot
then I have this gold wire basket which
is from tiger and then just in that I
normally keep my spare Polaroid film but
I don't actually have any at the moment
and then I also keep my Polaroid camera
which is in white and I basically take
all of the photos to my lower board on
this moving upper shelf we first of all
have this white wire house which is from
tiger and then in that I have a plant
from Ikea
in front of that I have another plant
from Ikea and then the little succulent
in a pot is from new look I want to say
or Primark it's one of them and then
behind that I have a sign that says
there is no elevator to success you have
to take the stairs and I personalized
this on an app called Pola gram I'll
leave my link for 5-pound free down
below this video isn't sponsored it's
just an app that I found and I genuinely
loved it and then in front of that I
have this gold wire geometric candle
holder and I just have a candle from
I want to say new look in it or maybe
IKEA older and next to that shelf I have
this gold wire geometric memo board
which is in Primark
for six pounds in the new range so you
can definitely still get this now it
came with those two prints on it but I
just have this ready for when I run out
of space on my other memo board because
I am quickly running out of space but I
obviously want to put up more Polaroids
and stuff so this is where I'm just
going to put Polaroids when I have ran
out of space and then this is at my
final shelf so starting off at the back
I have a geometric candle holder which
is some a little random shop in a town
called Oni I absolutely love this it was
fifteen pounds but I'm sure you could
find one similar maybe in tiger or in
new-look then I have another plant which
is from Ikea in front of that and then I
have three books Lauren Conrad beauty
and style and Alexa Chung it which I
think I'm pretty sure I got motivated
for my birthday or from Urban Outfitters
but I don't really read them I just get
them for display and then I have my
YouTube 100,000 subscriber plaque this
is definitely the most proud thing I
have in my room I am absolutely in love
with this I waited so long for it and I
was soaked out that as a family we got
it so I absolutely love that and that's
all down to you guys for getting me that
so thank you then I have this marble pot
which is also from Zoe's range and
inside of that I just have a plan which
is from new look and then finally I have
this gold light-up pineapple which is in
Primark and I love this this is
literally just it's screams tumbler what
