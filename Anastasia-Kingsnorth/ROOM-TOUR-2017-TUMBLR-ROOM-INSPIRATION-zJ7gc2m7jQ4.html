back and I know you doing a very
requested video today I am redoing my
room tour for 2017 which I am super
excited about literally I went to film
this now for like two three months
because I did one maybe like five or six
months ago but then as soon as I've done
it I changed my room so you didn't
really make sense but basically every
room talk I do I say I have the same
layout because my room is so small and
nobody realizes how small it is until
they physically come in it so I have the
same layout but I change everything
about it and in my room and like kind of
the color scheme to like different
shades and stuff so I have a ton of new
things in my room which I always get
asked where they're from so I just
thought I would do a room tour and give
you guys a huge tour of my room but yeah
that is basically what I'm going to be
doing today so I really hope you enjoy
the video and let's get stuff so here is
my room this is basically just a little
overview of what you see when you first
walk in now my room is so small nobody
realizes how small it is until they
actually walk in here like I cannot even
fit to my beds next to each other in my
room like it's so small but I do love my
room so much and I wouldn't want to
change it for anything but this is
basically what you see when you walk in
so I'm just going to do a huge little
overview of my room and then start going
into detail about all the different
things that you guys really want to know
where they're from so this is basically
the main part of my bed it looks so
different to what it used to like my
literally I used to have so many
colorful throw cushions on my bed like
blue green pink and then I just wanted
to kind of strip it back to the basics
and just go with this color theme of
like pastel pink rose gold and white so
all of my throw cushions are from
Primark the two white ones were in a
pack of two four six pound the gold one
was I also want to say six pounds and
the two in front of that was three
pounds each so 18 pounds for all of
those cushions which i think is really
good Primark do the best throw cushion
so just go to Primark if you want to
revamp your bed because honestly they
are so so good so then at the bottom of
my bed I have it two blankets which are
both in Primark the bottom one is from
Gaby's latest range and the top one is
just from the normal Primark home where
range and then on top of that I have
my life is Avis book I ordered this and
it came today and I'm so excited to read
it
I love Ava she's one of my favorite
youtubers so I just put the book at the
end of my bed ready to read and then on
my bedside cabinet which is next to my
bed I just have a white IKEA pot with an
Ikea plant in it then I have this white
ceramic pineapple which I got from
Poland yes
Paola and I literally got it like two
weeks ago so you'll still be able to go
and get it it's so good because if you
went to other place you should be paying
like 10 pounds for that and then I have
this copper lamp which I want to say is
from being Hugh but it might be from
home base so if I could still find the
link to it I'll link it down below but
yeah that's basically everything on my
bedside table so then if you move to the
right I have at my dressing table area
now as I've said in many videos before I
actually have to make my dressing table
because my room is too small that I
generally do not have the room for an
actual one so I basically got a Lac
shell from Ikea put that on the wall
with some brackets underneath because
the walls were very thin and then I've
got a mirror from bnm and just pop some
fairy lights around it which also from
Ikea and it just made my own cute little
dressing table and it's perfect for me I
mean now I would like a bit of a bigger
one because I do get ready at my
dressing table every day now whereas
when I was maybe like a year ago I
didn't bother using it but then on top
of that I've just got a few little
accessories so I've got a scarer pot
full of brushes I've got this little
cactus thing from new look a candle now
I've got a pineapple plant which is from
Primark I've got a sign that says
happiness is a journey not a destination
which is from bnm and then I just have a
bath and Bodyworks candle which i
obsessed with and i don't want to burn
because i don't know when i'm let's go
into America and I want to buy more but
I don't want to burn it until I know I
can buy more and then above my bed on
that wall I have this shelf and then
around the back I have some like fake
ivy which I got from being in bargains
and then to the left I have this white
and gold cactus which is from new look
again I've got this recently so you'll
still be able to get it then behind that
I have a plant with my friend Kaitlyn
got me and then to the right I have this
copper kind of terrarium thing with a
candle in the middle so Carly remember
where I got that from but I don't think
you'll be able to buy it anymore if I
can find something similar I'll link it
down below
and then your friend of that I have one
of those wire signs that say dream I got
this renewed look and again it was
recently so you're definitely still be
able to get it I'll link it down below I
love this show so much it's my new
favorite shelf because it's quite simple
that is quite a lot going along but at
the same time it's very simple so I just
really like it and the things on it I've
wanted for such a long time so then it
fought my little windowsill here I have
this bar that is from tiger and it's got
these really cute like eyes I want to
say they are on them and it was only two
pounds and I see this print all the time
in Urban Outfitters so when I saw it in
tiger the two pounds I knew I had to get
it and then I just have these loads of
fake flowers from Ikea because I always
buy real flowers and they just died on
me within like a week so I understand
there's so much money on flowers so just
thought I'd get these and they were all
40 pH so about five pounds worth but
they're so nice and they just look
really pretty in my room and then I've
got this here which is basically again
fake plants because I tend to kill all
my plants by accident and it's got these
little five pots and this is from the
range and I don't know how much it was I
think it was quite expensive but I do
really like it it's like a window box so
although that was kind of cute and then
down in the corner here but I don't know
if you'll be able to see it I just have
this little succulent plant and it's
pink and grey and it just has these cute
little succulents in it and again I
don't know where this is from but I want
to say it's somewhere like Tesco and
then as you move around my room a bit
more I have my absolute favorite part of
my room and it's my memory board this
just has so many memories on and all of
my favorite people like I just love this
so much I've got all my memories from
when I went to Paris with my YouTube
friends I went to Amsterdam with SAFF
when I went to Disney World when I had
to Universal in Florida where else have
I been I've been just London so many
times every time I go centre with amber
we take a photo and just all my friends
and it is just amazing and this is just
one of my favorite things ever is but so
many memories on and if I'm ever feeling
down what everything inside of stress I
can just look at this board and say you
know what I've gone and done so many
things in my life so far I'm only 16 and
it just reminds me how lucky I am so I
would actually recommend you guys are
doing something like this because it's
so motivating and every time you get a
look
souvenir or something you could just
come in your room and put it on and it's
just so nice I take them all on
Polaroids or I get them printed on this
app called Lola lab I'll leave my code
down below for five held worth of free
photos because it's so good this is a
sponsor I genuinely get all my photos
from there but just ones like this with
me my mummy and my family but yeah I
love this so much
and this is definitely my favorite part
of my room and then I have my wardrobe
and this is basically the part of my
room that nobody really sees because
it's like behind my doors you walk in my
doors just there I have my wardrobe
which is actually color-coordinated so
I'm going to give you guys a little
sneak peek but if you don't really like
a full wardrobe tour and how I organize
it and why I got all the things from let
me know because I loved organizing my
wardrobe like then I just have my Alex
jaws with a few bits on top but I'm not
going to go into detail with that
because I always do that in my makeup
collections so head over to my latest
makeup collection if you want to see
that or doing updated one so if you do
in an updated one let me know in the
comments down below but here is
basically a sneak peek at my wardrobes
we've got black gray khaki pink white
then all my trousers and my jackets my
school stuff and they've got boxes and
shoes down here so if you do want to see
a full on wardrobe tour let me know then
moving around to the wall at my bed is
on I have a few posters and this cute
little gold rack which I have a plant
and a notebook in I got these posters
two of them are from new look and the
bottom one that says breathe is a photo
that I also printed from la la lab the
notebook is from I want to say the range
or home scent and the copper wire thingy
is from a tiger then I have a shelf
underneath that so the copper light bulb
on the left is from Primark then I have
some cute little stones that nails inc
sent me with of some nail varnishes to
my P o box then I have this huge
succulent ceramic dish from Ikea a
copper box from H&amp;amp;M home some three
candles from wilkinson's I think they're
from a circulant candle a gold basket
from Tiger with my Polaroid in and then
one of my absolute favorite things at my
YouTube 100,000 subscriber plaque which
is out you guys I wouldn't have so thank
you so much then on top I have another
shelf and I have this white wire house
from tiger with a chevron candle in it
from as
then I have a canvas that says there is
no elevator success you have to take the
stairs
kind of like the other one I have about
happiness and I printed that on a canvas
from Lala Lab and then I have three
succulents from Ikea and a huge basket
full of Yankee Candle so whenever I want
to burn a candle I just go to that
basket and that is basically everything
in my room so that is the end of my
