and I first of all just want to
apologize for the Sun because the Sun
seems to have to be in my room room in
the mornings by all that clock doesn't
work so it's not a quarter to two so I'm
gonna start off with my bed area and
like I said in every room tour my bed is
from next
I've had it years so I don't think
they'll sell it anymore and then I just
have a plain white duvet which was from
Argos tea color match range and then for
all of my pillows the top right one I'm
not have to be sure where that was from
trying to think I know Wilkinson it was
from Wilkinson for four pounds the one
next to that was from Primark the white
lacy one was from Primark the pink rose
cushion it was from Tesco and the two
heart cushions at the front were both
from Primark for three pounds in threads
are polaroid pictures so I got these
printed from an app called Pola gram and
they're just an app that you can get
your photos printed off in in like po
Dori style so I will link a code down
below to get two pounds off because
honestly I love printing poda grams and
I think they look really cute around
fairy-like polo grams around my bed I
have a white shell from Ikea and I first
of all just have a stack of books at the
laundromat beauty and style book
floating floors glam guide Alexa Ching
it pointless book everything like that
and then on top of that I have a zoella
Beauty bag because that's kind of like a
youtuber shrine you know I like to call
it I then have my Yankee Candle meri
marshmallow medium jar and a little
plaque which I got from home bargains I
don't have a pile of magazines most of
which our company and L and then just
have an IKEA lantern and a white wicker
basket which holds all of my trash my
bed to the right I just have this
chalkboard or cork board which I got
from new look and I just like to hang my
benefit pictures or polar gram pictures
or anything on that bed in the top right
hand corner of my room I have my little
dressing table area so the mirror was
from the range and the Shelf is from
Ikea and I kind of just made my own
dressing table and I just put fairy
lights around it which were from Ikea
and then on top of that I have a scuba
pot with a fake plant in from both from
Ikea

all my MAC lipsticks in and then another
Skua pot which has all of my makeup
brush

checkered cushion on which is also from
Ikea a lot of things from my camera my
room and then on top of my bedside
cabinet my alarm clock is from being in
bargains my Yankee Candle was giving me
for a Valentine's Day present from amber

given to me from my family but it was
from Argos and the little heart on it
was for a vintage shop I then just have
a stack of books like love Tanya and two
