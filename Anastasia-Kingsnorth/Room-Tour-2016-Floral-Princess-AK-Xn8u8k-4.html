going to be doing my room tour for 2016
so I did a room tour times like back in
the summer time and my room it was very
pink and white instead of anything come
white but recently I have been adding so
much like copper geometric key stuff to
it and I really really really wanted to
show you guys I have literally I love
how it turned out and I really wanted to
show you like all the new additions and
tell you I got it from because I know
that obviously rose gold copper
geometric they're all very popular
themes and a lot of people always want
to know where to get this type of stuff
from because I especially did like I was
actually like go into the weird side of
YouTube to find like all the different
stuff for my room
yeah that made no sense but you know I
was searching everywhere and now I can't
read the pages were to go and get it so
I thought this would be really handy to
kind of like tell you where to go and
get loads of things and also just a time
to take a sneak peek into my bedroom so
yeah I'm just going to be doing a normal
room tour today I'm just going to talk
through it and just tell you where
everything's from and yeah so I hope you
enjoy the video and let's get started
okay so as you come into a room but this
is kind of the first thing you will see
my bed my bedside cabinet and my
dressing table as these are on the far
back wall so my bed hasn't really
changed since my last room tour each is
the same bed from next and as you can
see I just have some fairy lights
hanging round it and then on my bed I do
have some new cushion so I have a huge
white folks keep posting one it's fake
though which is from B N and then I have
Gabi's cushion from her Primark range
but it's sadly now like discontinued
because it all sold out and then I have
another question that says be happy be
bright be you which isn't written in
gold and that is also from Primark and
then moving on it to my bedside cabinet
this is from I think it's from next but
I did get given it a long long time ago
so I'm pretty sure you wouldn't be able
to buy it anymore and then I just have a
cute little heart that says love which
was from card Factory and then on my
bedside cabinet I have a copper lamp
which my dad got me for my birthday I
love this this is from home base and
then I have a white pot with a green
plant in it that is pretty much dead now
so do you need to get a new plant and
then I
having mini bath and Bodyworks pumpkin
cupcake handle then moving on to my
dressing table so my dresser table is
made up as my room is really small and
there's definitely not room for a
dressing table in there so I just have
my chair from Ikea which one and got me
and then I just have a cushion on it as
well as also from Ikea and then the
mirror is from the range and the
shellfish from Ikea with these little
brackets underneath as probably a lot of
you could tell in previous videos it was
nearly falling off the walls so I have
to get something to start holding it up
and then I have on top of my dressing
table my brushes my brush pots are are
from Ikea and then the copper one that
we've like these copper little marks on
it like a honeybee hive I guess um it
looks like it's from all on the burners
but it's actually from Dunelm mill and
then I just have my little copper
ice-cold tea drink glass this is from
new look and that just has some flowers
in which I got from Ikea and then I have
a pink sign that says happiness is a
journey not a destination and this
wouldn't be an M and then I finally have
like a circle chevron candle which was
from Asda I think and I think I got it
for about two pounds fifty in the sale
and then on the wall I just have this
huge white wicker heart this is from VN
m and it actually came with like a
ribbon background it but I really did
not like the ribbon so I just got rid of
that but I absolutely love this oh my
god it's just so cute and then above my
dressing table and my bed on that wall I
do have a shelf so the Shelf
I think is from BNN it is kind of
matching my other two IKEA ones but not
as well as I would like it to so on the
far right I have this copper geometric
terrarium which was 15 pounds from a
chakras chic boutique in Olney I think
there was only one and I'm really not
sure why they bought it from I it was
just kind of like a no charity shop at a
very very small shop and I loved it and
then I have my three books the Lauren
Conrad Beauty long car style and elected
trunk it I then have this copper box
which one Lange got me for Christmas
which is from hate H and M and I just
keep all of my Polaroids in this and
then I have a cactus from Ikea and then
another like geometric pot with a
plantain and this was from Dunelm milk
I then have my window which I never
really show to be honest but the window
just lifts up not that you always know
that but obviously some of you wanted to
know how my window opens and then I have
a jug with some fake tulips in which
with my Kia and a candle that my mum got
me of the day that says not all stars
belong in the sky which I love and then
I have this geometric e copper T light
holder which was from home bargains but
I did get it for my birthday and then I
have this happiness is homemade sigh
which was from card Factory and I love
that on the floor I then just have my
photo shoot skin rug which again is fake
from Ikea this is only ten pounds and
just ignore something like the paper
bits over there I'm not really sure what
it is so I'm going to have to clean my
floor after this but then I also have my
two IKEA Pingala boxes and they're just
pink striped boxes in the bottom I keep
lush and in the top one I keep school
stuff and then I just have my macbook on
top of that and then moving up to my
other shelf I have a huge copper basket
that my nan got me for Christmas from
H&amp;amp;M and this just has all of my uncle
candles in it I have three large jars
two medium and a small jar left of burn
I then have a light up arrow a few
cactuses a glass jar with a copper lid
which in home bargains a geometric
candle holder which was from new look a
little copper geometric pot which from
hmm as well and then I just have that
little cactus on the end which is from
Ikea and this quote that says live laugh
love I think everything has what it says
and that was from card Factory and then
on the shelf underneath I just have some
more copper stuff so starting from the
left I have a white wicker basket which
I love I then have this light bulb
terrarium and I I just think this looks
so so nice it's so cute and I got this
from potting turn and then behind that I
just have a picture that I made and in
front of that I have three different
kiln jars which I also made so you never
Ellen might be a tutorial coming on that
very soon and then I also have on the
end a copper geometric basket which was
from Tiger for three pounds and in that
I just keep my Polaroid and in the far
back you can see a poster that says
small like your own Disneyland and it
has a little printers in the corner and
that is
biposto do you have a merchandise range
if you didn't actually know I will link
it on the screen and I will also link it
down below if you want to go have a
cheeky look I then have I think this is
my favorite part of my room and this is
my youtube 100,000 subscriber plaque so
this came through the posting of the day
and I literally could not believe it it
says YouTube floor printers
congratulations for surpassing 100,000
subscribers and it is just absolutely
beautiful I keep this hanging up on my
wall right above my like next to my
window and I look at every night when I
go to sleep because I'm honestly so so
thankful so thank you so much for
getting me there and we are at 120,000
now which is crazy I just don't know
where you guys keep coming from but I
just wanted to say a huge thank you for
this and yeah that is next to my window
on the floor I then have this copper
geometric basket that was also from H&amp;amp;M
it was six pounds and it's full of body
shop products it's like my body shop
basket I've actually really be getting
into using the body shop products at the
moment I'm loving them and then I just
have this huge long mirror that is from
bnm and it just has this gorgeous
vintage pattern around it and then I
also have this copper Lantern which was
10 pounds of bnm as well and I just have
a fake candle in that and I love
switching this one at night it is so
relaxing so then on the other side of my
room I have my Alex jaws with all of my
makeup in I recently did a makeup
collection which I will link down below
if you want to go see it and then I also
have my wardrobe but I'm actually
looking into getting a new wardrobe
because I'm just not really keen on it
anymore and I really just want a smaller
one because I can't really fully fill it
up like I don't have enough clothes to
fill it so I am looking into getting a
smaller one but yeah that is basically
everything in my room so that at the end
