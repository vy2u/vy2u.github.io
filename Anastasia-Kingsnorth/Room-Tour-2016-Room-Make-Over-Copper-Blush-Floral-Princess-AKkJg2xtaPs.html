going to be doing my room tour for 2016
so this video has been so requested for
me to do another room tour and I was
like you know what I am going to do
another room tour because I love doing
room tours and there has been a lot of
new additions to my room as I am kind of
in the middle of adding more colors to
it and making it more colorful and
spring into summer like so I thought it
would be nice again to give you kind of
an update and what I've been doing and
give you a really in-depth tour of my
room
so yeah that I was basically what I'm
gonna do today this is already a really
long video so I am just going to get
straight into it so this is the first
thing you see when you step foot into my
room I have explained this in previous
videos before but I do actually have a
really really really small room and
there's just not a lot you can do with
the space which is why I tried to make
it as nice as possible with the space I
have because this position that my bed
is currently in I can't actually move it
because my bed will physically not fit
anywhere else because if I had it on the
opposite side of the wall it would cover
the radiator in the window and it just
wouldn't be right and it doesn't fit
lengthways on the back of my wall either
so I have to kind of have it like this
which is why I kind of DIY
dressing-table and it's up on the wall
but I just really love my room and as
you can see there are a lot of new
additions and you will see that as I
talk you through everything in my room
but yeah so this is an overview of my
room and let's just get straight into
the room tour so starting off with my
bed area which is where I kind of always
like to start off with because it is the
main focal point of my room
so my bed is from next and it is a long
long time ago I got this like this is
the only bed I've had all through my
life because I just kept it because I
really really like it I think it was
quite expensive because it was from next
but as I said it is lasted me like 12 13
years so it's pretty amazing and I'm
sure you can find a really similar bed
if you are looking for one like this so
then as you can see I just have a plain
white duvet cover because I feel like if
I added too many patterns in my room it
would make it look even smaller than it
already is so I just have a plain white
duvet cover which I got from Argos it's
just one of the color match ones because
I don't think I need you to go glamour
with a really expensive white duvet I
just got kind of cheapest one I could
find and then I just have three bed
pillows through normal bed pillows
because I have to sleep with a lot of
pillows and then in front of that I have
three of my throw cushions so the first
big one which was the faux sheepskin e
one this is from B and M it is fake faux
sheepskin that's why I said fight it's
fake and yeah this is for bnm it was
eight pounds and then the pillow in
front of that the one made out of rose
gold sequins is from Gabby's collection
at Primark
I loved her collection so much so I just
picked up that cushion and it really
brings my room together and then in
front of that I just have a cushion
which I got from new look and that was
eight pounds which I think is to sit
yeah that I was going to say that was
the most expensive but it actually there
were all eight pound so I just really
really liked them and I thought like
they look very nice together and they
kind of pull my room together so then at
the end of my bed I also have some more
throw cushion so as you can see I first
of all have this really thick fluffy
blanket this was from Primark and it was
about 25 pounds which is very expensive
for a blanket but I've got so much use
out of it and I really do love it and
then I have two more throw cushions
which are from Primark the first one
says be happy be bright for you and this
was four pounds and the Polka Dot gold
one in front of that was three pounds
and then I just have a little cuddly toy
of Murray which me and amber both got
from the Disney Store and I love them I
then have my bedside table next to my
bed so my actual bedside table it was a
gift from my aunty although I know you
can buy them from argos and places like
that i believe they're around 35 pounds
to buy on top of that I didn't have my
copper spotlight lamp this is I believe
25 pounds from either being cute or home
base I got it for my birthday from my
dad but I know that it's from one of
those places and then in front of that I
have a bath and Bodyworks candle in the
scent pumpkin cupcake and then I also
just have this white tinned pot which
was only 99 P from Ikea with a huge fake
green plantain also from Ikea you'll
probably notice a lot of my roommates
from Ikea because IKEA is BAE and I love
it
I'm moving on to my favorite area of my
room which is at my dressing table so as
you can see my dressing table
actually made up from kind of a mirror
and a shelf so the shelves was from Ikea
it's just a lack shelf and then the
mirror was from the range I think was
around eight to nine pounds it really
wasn't expensive but it is such a good
color at DIY because as I said my name
is just way too small to actually have a
dressing table so if your room is small
or you're looking for a dressing table
like this I would definitely recommend
using a shelf in a mirror and then on
top of that and around that actually I
have some fairy lights which are also
from Ikea
I love IKEA fairy lights because even
though they're around 15 pounds to buy
I've had these for three years now and
they are still absolutely fine like as
bright as ever
now I said that it probably went out but
I just seriously loved them on my actual
dressing table as you can see to the
left I just have the scurry pot also
from Ikea these are only two pounds and
I'm pretty sure you probably would have
seen them in every single person's
YouTube video but I just use them to
hold my makeup brushes then on the other
side I have this plaque that says
happiness is a journey not a destination
and I love this it was only 199 from bnm
as it's just something because that
makes me really happy because I love
being happy I don't know just makes me
really happy how cringy and then I also
have two things by the side of that the
first one on the right is a chevron
gold candle this was from aster and it
was only 5 pounds and it has three weeks
in it it's also nice and then I just
have this really cute white and copper
Lantern with some flake flowers in
because I know you thought it looked
really cute and it wasn't your cluttered
but at the same time I don't know just
look really nice and then as you can see
up on the wall on my right wall I have
this absolutely huge white wicker heart
this was only $9.99 from bnm and if you
haven't been to bnm I would definitely
recommend it the home aisle is insane
and everything is so cheap so if you
haven't been to bnm go to be an M so now
moving on to my windowsill and this is
kind of near enough the setup you see
when I film so now you can kind of see
her behind the scenes of where I film
but yeah so first of all I just have a
bunch of tulips I got these last night
from Tesco don't know why I'm telling
you where the flowers are from but
apparently to knit on my lucky flowers
so you know when I'm bought some tulips
and then I just have a little copper
candle that says natural stars belong in
the sky which was only 99 P from card
factory like yes card Factory and also
on my windowsill I just have this kind
of three geometric e copper T light
holders this was three pounds 99 from
home bargains even though I did get if
my birthday but I chose it but I really
do love this as you can see some of the
wax are kind of mighty light so I should
probably clean that up but I really like
this it's kind of like a centerpiece to
my room if that makes any sense and then
finally at the end of my windowsill I
have this copper wire a witch at my
friend Kaitlyn got me when it was my
hundred thousand celebration party and I
love this so much I'm going to keep this
in my room forever and yeah Thank You
Kaitlyn for that one of my most
favoritest things ever in my room is my
memo board and this is actually a DIY in
one of my DIY videos so if you haven't
already seen it you definitely should go
watch it because this is my favorite DIY
I've ever done I just printed off a load
of photos from an app called lalala I'm
pretty sure I've talked about it quite a
lot so you guys should know about it but
there's always a code in the description
box down below to get 5 pounds worth of
free photos this video isn't sponsored
or anything it's just a genuine app that
I really love so you should definitely
go do that because I just save a load of
quotes off the inset that I like and as
you can see I just print them all out so
it's so easy and I love it and then I
also just have some Polaroids up there
of like different memories and I have
some tickets to places I've been and is
a new addition to my room but it's a new
addition that I really really love so
then as you can see leading on to the
back wall of my bedroom I have my
wardrobe this is from next as well all
of my kind of like main furniture is
from next because again I've had this
all of my life it's one of the best
audience I've ever had even though I am
looking into getting a new wardrobe
because I just don't need a wardrobe as
big of this in my tiny room but it's a
really good wardrobe nevertheless there
next to my wardrobe I have one of again
at my favorite parts to my rooms and it
is my makeup err
so as you can see I have the Alex 9
drawers which I bloody love I'm sorry
that I swore but I love them and then on
top of that I just have like a lot of
other things I do have a makeup
collection already up on my channel or
if it's not already up it'll probably be
coming next week so I don't know
whatever way it's either up or it's
coming next week but either way get
excited because I will link it on screen
if it's already up but I definitely
doing a new makeup collection because I
have a load of new storage and just say
my lip drawer is looking amazing
he only heard you two so myself I just
love it so much so yeah if you do want
to make a collection or if you've seen
it you know give this video a thumbs up

all of the things that are kind of
standing on the floor in my room I'm
going to move on to my shelves so the
first thing I have is this what wicker

baskets that you have lying about I then
just have this little pot of cactuses I
made up i depotted some of the IKEA

just kind of love how it looks it looks
like a mini terrarium thing and then I
just have some stones which I got from
the Sea Life Center which I actually
have a meaning but I can't remember what
they mean and then I just have this
little quote that says live every moment

love this quote so much it's from car
