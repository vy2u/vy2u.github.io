a summer room tour for you so I know how
requested these videos are and I was
like you know what let's do another one
because my room has completely changed
since my last one and I loved it so much
at the moment that I thought I would do
another one so I really hope you enjoy
the video let's get this video to 4,000
thumbs up and yes let's get started
as if every room tour I've ever done on
my channel I'm just gonna start off with
my bed area so my bed is exactly the
same as last time it's from next and
then the frame is just white and curly
and then on my bed I have a variety of
pillows from bnm Tesco and Primark I
will link where everything is from down
below if you would like to go and get
them you can and then on my bed I also
just keep my laptop and possibly a book
as well then moving on to my bedside
cabinet my bedside cabinet is from Argus
and then on top of that I just have an
Ikea Rose candle I have a IKEA white pot
with an IKEA plant in everything from
Ikea shock and a lamp which actually is
actually a is Mikey at oops and then
just to be happy heart from like a
random vintage store and then I just
keep some pocket backs in there
then swiftly moving on to my dressing
table area so my chair can you get so
it's from Ikea and can you get soda
Peters from Ikea that's basically what
my room is made up of so as I've said in
a lot of different videos actually my
room is way too small to have a proper
dressing table because if I could have a
dressing table I definitely would have
the really popular one from Ikea that
amber and Lily have but as I said my
rooms look big enough for that so
therefore I had to make up my own so I
have a shellfish room the bay place IKEA
and then I have a mirror which is from
bnm and on top of that I just have a
load of different things like a little
drink like a rose lemonade I got from
Waitrose a white tray from bnm that says
love on it and then I have a little
watering can with a fake planting from
bnm and also a sign from B and M as well
being a mutt like here aren't the most
amazing places for home stuff definitely
go and check them out if you want some
of the stuff in this video okay so if
you have been watching me since around
March time when I did my last room tour
you would know that before I had this
white wicker heart from VN n here I had
a hard shelf but I thought that looked a
bit cluttered and a bit too much there
for a litter said I bought this white
wicker heart from bnm I think this made
my room looks so much better and just
not as cluttered so definitely like if
you have a shelf if you think it looks
too cluttered buy something like this
because it completely changes how your
room looks and I think it looks so much
better now moving around my room to my
windowsill so on my windowsill I just
have three IKEA cactuses I then have
this happinesses homemade sign from the
card factory I have a Yankee Candle
sugared a collage art and a milk bar
with three flowers from Ikea in
then underneath my windowsill I have two
boxes from Ikea and these are quarter
pingle boxes and they are just black no
black and white what the pink and white
and then on top of that I have my pretty
new actually it sprinkleofglitter
life of sprinkleofglitter book if you
don't have that picking up the kids oh
my god it's like one of the best
youtuber books has ever existed okay so
we are literally at the favorite part of
my room now I don't even know why but it
is my shoe back area so my shoe back is
actually from being in bargained for
only eight pounds which is incredible
because I think it's one of the nicest
shoe racks I've ever seen and then I
just have three pairs of shoes on it one
from newdark which are the heels and the
other toe from Primark
I then just have a faux sheepskin rug
from Ikea and then I have an Ikea
Skua pot we've actually being
discontinued and that is full of soap
and glory
so that is the end of my room tour for
the summer 2015 the reason I didn't show
thee basically the other half of my room
is because it only has my wardrobe in my
annex goes on and I'm actually trying to
like put my Alex George I want them
before I do a makeup collection
therefore I didn't want to show you them
because when I do my makeup collection
I'm gonna make it the best makeup
collection I've ever done and I didn't
want you to get any sneak peeks of how
my Alex shows look at the moment that is
why I didn't show that but I did hope I
did hope I do hope you enjoy seeing the
rest of my room because I love doing
room tours for you guys let me know if
you did by giving this video a huge
thumbs up and let's see if we can get it
to 4,000 thumbs up because that would be
amazing I love it also thank you so much
