and I am going to be doing a school
morning routine for 2017 so this is one
of the first videos in my back to school
series and I'm super excited
back-to-school season is a 100% my
favorite season to film YouTube videos
you can get your hose in you can get
your routines in you can get your hacks
in you can get everything and even
though I'm not going back to school this
year I'm going into 6/4 it's still my
absolute like favorite Caesar call it a
season like it's bloody like autumn but
I don't know I just love it so yeah that
is basically what I'm going to be doing
for you today I really really really
hope you enjoy it give it a huge thumbs
up if you did and let's get straight on
into the video so my morning normally
starts off around 6:30 when my alarm
will go off I normally have a Reece low
start to the morning I prefer to get up
early so I can genuinely enjoy myself
and not have to rush around but then
again this is the more idealistic view
of what could happen and this could also
happen on your morning
if you are lucky enough for that not to
happen then I will literally just chill
in the morning until about seven o'clock
like I said I like to have a really slow
start so I'll go on Instagram Twitter
snapchat basically all of my social
medias which you should possibly go
follow me on if you don't already
I always update them every single
morning and I've started to use my
snapchat a lot more as well I do
obviously daily vlog now but I have been
using my snapchat just for like other
updates about things that you guys don't
usually see so go give that photo if you
have an or idea I really think you
should then a hundred percent gets to my
favorite time and that is breakfast time
now as I'm actually going into six warm
I'm not actually going to normal school
anymore I do have a bit more time in the
morning so I'm gonna start to eat a bit
more healthy and have different
breakfasts over than cereal so this
morning I had fried eggs flat eggs
whatever you like to call them and toast
literally this was the first time I had
cooked eggs in a long time and they
actually turned out like freely decent
I'm not gonna lie I was pretty happy
with myself so I just took that out of
the frying pan you know as you do
took it upstairs and decided to sit and
watch some YouTube I'll state it
basically the mornings are my time just
kind of catch up on YouTube and catch up
on different things that I've missed
whilst being asleep so I was actually
watching the bay that is saffron
Barker's vlog this morning I absolutely
loved her go and watch her vlogs if you
haven't already she's definitely one of
my favorite vloggers I actually adore
her see ya I just sat and watched her
blog and then I started to vlog for my
own vlog channel you know you just have
to update everybody in the morning and I
am attempting daily vlogging so that is
exactly what I was doing next up I start
to get ready so I'm currently using my
selfie skin program which is basically a
three-step program that I'm using for 60
days to help clear up my skin so I first
of all just took the cleanser which is
the face wash and wash my face with that
I just put it on using circular motions
to really get into the deep pores of my
skin and this feels it's so refreshing I
absolutely love it and then I took step
two which is the moisturizer and it
applied this straight after I'd washed
and dried my face this is
so moisturizing and hydrating before I
do I make up it's amazing and then you
also have the step 3 which is the night
cream which I do apply before I go to
bed so I just wanted to pop in and
quickly tell you a little bit more about
this skincare brand that I'm using as it
is genuinely really good and I've been
using it for around two weeks now and
I'm seeing such a difference in my skin
already so selfies again it's basically
a three-step skin care set or routine if
you will that is good for acne prone
skin and will hopefully eventually lead
you to beautiful clear skin at the end
of it use it for sixty days and I'm
going to be using it for these for 60
days and fingers-crossed is gonna make
my skin a lot better because I do have
very acne prone skin I have a lot of
blemishes it's very oily and I needed
something that you could buy that wasn't
necessarily the usual face wash that I
normally use in the hope that it might
clear up my skin so if you download the
selfie skin app you can actually track
your progress so you take photos at the
beginning then take photos a few weeks
in and the people can keep a track on
your progress and see if it's actually
helping your skin or not you can buy it
on Amazon and if you don't actually
think it's working or if they don't
think it's working and at the end of the
60 days it just doesn't appear to work
for you you can actually get a refund a
full refund on the product so which i
think is absolutely incredible
so 100% would definitely recommend them
I'm going to be using them for the for
60 days in the hope that it's gonna
clear my skin up but yeah I wanted to
pop in and tell you guys that but the
linked fight will be down below and I
would definitely definitely recommend it
but yeah
overlap let's get back into the morning
routine it then makeup time and I
absolutely love doing my school makeup I
do a very natural makeup look but it's
definitely one of my favorites so I
started off by taking the Too Faced
hangover primer and then I took my
L'Oreal true match foundation god knows
how many times I've spoken about this
foundation in my videos it's literally
one of the only foundations I will swear
by I then took my Kat Von D lock-it
concealer which looking at that I felt
like I need a lighter shade but anyway I
just blended that into my skin just to
give myself a little bit of extra
coverage then I just powdered it and
contoured my face and while the powders
on my face I filled in my eyebrows using
the Ardell brow pomade in medium brown
this is the best brow pomade ever I much
prefer the Anastasia Beverly Hills one I
just I don't know I just prefer it
describe why once I highlighted my face
as well using the Nippon fab palette I
just took my Maybelline colossal mascara
just to add more length and more
definition to my eyelashes and to make
me look a bit more awake considering it
was a school day and then finally I just
took quite a face melt his mat in child
star this is a gorgeous nude matte lip
for school and it's perfect if you don't
want anything to out there but you still
want to wear a lip color then I took to
my hair and yes I have had my hair dyed
if you guys haven't noticed already I'm
currently in the process of getting it
done so like you have to kind of wait a
few times like at the hairdresser until
it looks exactly how you want it but
yeah I just straightened all my hair out
and just pops that over to one side I
just like to have my hair very simple
and very easy for school but if you do
want to see like a school hairstyles
video let me know in the comments down
below because I'll definitely do one
then around 8 o'clock it is outfit time
and luckily for me now I'm into 6 4 I
can actually wear my own clothes I no
longer have to wear a uniform so I could
just pick an outfit out of my wardrobe
as long as it is classed as smart I
haven't been shopping yet so please
ignore that other fact that I wore a
branded teacher but I am gonna go smart
clothes shopping but yeah once I've got
my bag I am ready to leave the house
that is the end of the video I really
hope you enjoyed it

huge thumbs up if you aren't already
