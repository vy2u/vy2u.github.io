surprising my mum video I wouldn't
necessarily say it's a prank it kind of
is but it's not like a bad outcome it's
a good outcome so basically my mum
thinks that we are just filming a video
where we're going to be testing the not
necessarily the reliability but like how
often you can win on scratch card so
we've been to the shop we've bought a
ton of scratch cards that we're going to
scratch and I basically said to my mum
which is kind of doing an experiment and
a QA about seeing how much money we can
get back from buying however many
scratch cards my mum thinks that I'm
gonna keep all of the winnings she
doesn't think she's gonna get anything
out of there she's basically just being
in another video for me so I just kind
of want to repay her because she does so
much for me and I know she tries her
absolutely hardest and she tried so hard
for me to get me the birthday present
that she got for me I know she did and I
just kind of want to give back to her a
little bit now obviously I could just
unload go and buy some flowers and just
hand her to them in a vlog but me and my
mum kind of had this little thing where
we love to in scratch cos we're not like
gambling or anything but we just love
buying scratchers so every time you do
the food shopping you always bought like
a pound one and we just see if we can
win
and once my mum 150 pounds on one and it
was like it literally the best day of
her life it made her weak she wouldn't
stop talking about it so I thought why
not kind of try and do that again
like obviously it's a complete gamble
because I have no idea how much we're
going to win there scratchcards like you
could win twenty pounds back or you
could win a hundred pounds back so what
I'm gonna do is she doesn't know that
she's gonna be getting any of the
winnings we're basically just gonna film
the whole video it's a proper video as
well so you guys can actually see and
then I'm gonna say to her okay like I'm
gonna keep it away and I'm gonna go
chained to them at the shop but I'm
actually not going to go change in the
shop I'm gonna go to the shop buy some
flowers buy some chocolates and I'm also
gonna add like a little bit of extra
money in with the winnings and then kind
of just put it on the table so hopefully
she'll go upstairs
coño says and it will kind of just be
there for her isn't it like thank you
for doing what she can for me so that's
the plan she's currently out at the
moment I am waiting for my driving
instructor
come and pick me up for my first driving
lesson but yeah that is the plan so I'm
just gonna get straight into the video
now my mum thinks it's basically just
scratching off the scratch cars just to
see how much we can win okay we have
arrived at our first stop me in the car
we're gonna get half of them from here
half of them from Tesco so let's go here
they are
which one should we go just eighty four
to five pound ones but I think we should
get there from here
that one looks good yeah I'll make
something to do that one so I've got my
load of scrapped cards here I think I
just spent 31 pounds on all of this lot
so I thought everyone knows I'm going to
get 19 pounds worth of Tesco to make up
50 pounds worth of special products we
have come to shop number two we are at
Tesco I'm sorry the quality of the audio
is going to be so bad but we've come
here to get the remaining scratch cars
I've spent 31 pounds so I need to spend
another 19 pounds I was we doing a test
of how much 50 cards worth of scratch
cards and really winner and here are our
next lot of scratch cards we have now
spent 50 pounds so much money I too
literally cannot believe you spent that
much but this is very very exciting so
now we're going to get in the car up
we're gonna scratch you guys are gonna
see if we've won anything
there we go here are all of the scratch
cards now let's get scratching so we
have all of our Scotch cards here ready
to go ma'am which one are you going to
go for first I'm gonna scratch the it's
called 21 21 ways okay I know this
ticket you can win up to 21 times
imagine that I'm gonna go for the
hundreds out of the one to stop prize of
1 million okay so it basically just
gonna keep scratching then we keep
talking to you guys and as we do it so
I'm starting off with the pound ones the
parents are actually my favorite ones to
scratch so I know I've got butterflies
why it's the anticipation don't think I
want anything on the first one the first
one so did you do I know round 1 so
we're just gonna put those ones down
there don't think I would anything on
this one either we never have any luck
with these monopoly ones never know
what you meant to do with the bonus I
find that to win no again look how
nothing told you I told you some the
five pound ones God that shop he think
he'd at least get a fiver well no you
wouldn't because if they gave the fire
flavor they would earn any money back on
everyone
Wow I'm gonna go for one of these boring
ones now we haven't even want a pounder
yeah yeah yeah find a diamond to employ
Sandusky Christmas one nothing oh this
ain't good Anna nothing on the Chris
ain't good is it finished with it yeah
what do the bonus games I didn't realize
it was a bonus game on those ones where
do you bonus what's it called when it
makes that noise you got tax no I I want
a pound
thank God I do thank God I found it
diamonds want a pound
yeah that's okay yeah how we doing on
them one cinnamon well at least we got
pound I didn't realize it was a bonus
game so bonus game on that I'm an
awfully one too awful
okay well we've won a pound so when is
pie oh that's going over there okay pal
we're little fun to pump and a five
pound cash probably 1/2 pound on it
match the cheeseburger and share sauna
oh yeah well think on that wasn't y'all
this idea this is putting me off boner
this nothing on these two over this is
shocking nothing on them - oh this is
bad news man that's a lot of a we doing
now I'm gonna go for the three hot money
while doing this doc got 50 pounds just
goes like that I've just realized I've
paid 50 pound on paper and it's just
gone like that I've won two pounds are
they go 1/2 pound on a pound card
we're on 4 pounds at the moment from 4
pounds I'm all with once I fired from
Pam ones maybe we should've bought 50 1
pound ones yeah have you done some the
stocking filler ones if you wouldn't
even know this how many know what I've
also lost my one penny you know when you
see that one pound you like yeah I'm
probably gonna win a pound pound
not good so is there I think my Anna
this is a shock you ready for this yeah
afraid no win really that I might I'm
using the different scrap our current
it's not why is it well known that one
run another pound oh yeah one another
pound one another pass 20 pound on this
one okay that's alright so much who
Wednesday fell so this is another pound
with one here so one pound three pound
for pound five pound seven pounds I
think
I let all on one pound card yeah so I
guess it just goes to show at the moment
one pound cards are doing it yeah do
it's better wait until you've done that
and then I can take that off of you 2
pounds 3 pounds 5 pounds cards left out
and I've got a three pound 104 all three
pound ones left okay so I'm gonna go
through a two pound while the cash flow
to bingo and they get fruity I'm doing
the fast 201 now best hearts have been
200 pound
alright winning numbers this is like the
one I want 50 pound on that Carol
scratch on yours I'm getting a bit yes I
know it's a bit if I won - i won t power
or want to pound my four pounds oh
that's biggest win so far today guys
yeah one for pattern white if you just
hang up no one for power that's okay
what we actually didn't have all power
on the two pound card now I'm going to
save that one till last I'm gonna do a
three pound one hidden treasure there's
quite a lot to this one scratch here
first your coordinates if I think these
ones are better because it's like the
anticipation lasts for longer doesn't it
yeah they think agree so I've got on my
coordinate Hajis can't believe
that that's all we've won so far I'm
quite a shock pop hat yeah I'm quite it
put me off buying him actually but she's
probably a good thing already say some
money
why not buying him shock Internet do you
think Nana yeah no I didn't win anything
on this and what woman is that on a 3
pound top prize 100 no I didn't I need a
60 80 100 bear it no I think I'm too
much it's all scratched it roll 6b I've
got 6 B 6 a any checking what if you
might have once a man no a check
I'm rechecking but I've scratched it
wrong I scratched it wrong that was a
nice excitement how much would I have
won 100 pound really sure you haven't
won over 100 percent I need is 6 C but
100% I haven't okay well that was the
closest we got to a hundred pounds that
was in the thing going ones and then I'm
gonna save my five pound one till last
this experiment hasn't been really well
has it he shot me anyway really ass
I certainly won't be buying as many no
certainly not
look someone's having a laugh with us I
mean I don't want to think on this one
oh no I think somebody's having a laugh
it doesn't cry
look they go get food not a thing I'm
happy about this it honestly is just
like well well it is it's not check your
money down the drain and and I used to
like I don't really buy a lot about to
come out you don't
hey you don't old I felt like the odd
one but you I think our point if I want
some out one of them up one amount for
now this is really you didn't used to
used to know why were after this
experiment I will
oh yeah yeah because I know they'll
never they obviously do have to make
their money too somehow
okay certainly making era verse further
why just get fun out of it yeah it is
but you know it's to win a big money
Anna obvious they have been lush to win
over gosh
63 incopy heart scratcher anymore so
guys I scratched me bingo won and I won
three pounds and now I'm scratched only
five pound won and I've managed to win
ten pounds back so far so they were
looking at that I won't wear anything
else but you know at least you've got
well this was only a five pound yeah
yeah so much needed because I wanna get
up 115 pounds yeah but again you know
I've got twenty nine fifteen pound guys
the best one until last yeah s to last
time
if 115-pound T what I'm chuffed with
that yeah because you deserve that after
you know me
no yes so I 115 pounds back on this one
wow that's brilliant 25 25 and 29 18 19
20 21 22 tree three twenty four twenty
five three six three seven twenty eight
twenty nine twenty nine pounds we've got
over half of our money back
this is true and 29 pounds worth of
winnings but my fifteen pounds it would
have only been 14 pounds but I bet 15
you've got over half you winning I got
that one so we'll update you guys there
so far we've got 29 pounds over huh yeah
I'm chef with that so guys we have come
to a conclusion that we have won back 29
pounds and then we have lost out on 21
it's not bad this is the Lewton pile
this is a winnin pile and obviously the
one the five pound one at the end helped
so much out it would have been a 14
pound d1 back out of 50 but overall I
don't think that's that bad I'm pretty
29 yeah I'm bad that's not bad got over
half your money back so it's over half
the money back so I think that's pretty
fair ever net I think that's fair so
it's way to say no exciting but it's
fair it's fair exactly thank you so much
for watching guys I really hope you
enjoyed this video if you did remember
to give it a huge thumbs up and I will
see you on Sunday at 10 a.m. a free
brand new video bye
okay so I am now home again I'm gonna
wait because obviously your mommy's
downstairs
I've just been to Tesco I picked up some
flowers or some chocolates and basically
what I'm going to do is so earlier as
you saw we won 30 pounds on the scratch
card
so I've Drew out and it 100 pounds so I
would give him that and then the 30
pounds that'd be one she thinks that I
was keeping the winnings but I'm
actually giving them to her and I'm
going to surprising her with some
flowers and chocolates
the reason I've done this is because I
know my mum tries her absolute best to
provide for me and give me everything
that she can so I just kind of want to
give her a little bit back in like a
surprise sort of way so she genuinely
thought she was doing that for the money
for me except we were doing it for her
so that's really exciting and obviously
I just wanted to give her a little bit
just so she could go and treat herself
and do whatever she wanted to with it so
I'm gonna try and get her upstairs and
then try and put those downstairs and
then hide the camera to see what her
reaction is that's what I'm gonna try
and do dinner with it's gonna work but
it's gonna fail because mommy if I take
mom come upstairs she's gonna be like
why 'allah sit down so she might have to
like go out for a cigarette or something
like that and I put it down but that is
the plan let's see how it goes
let's do this oh my gosh is windy
early Wednesday when you put soil on its
lucky
that's me oh my no oh the video without
cheese do the scratchcards it was like
we keep you all the winnings and then
I've been blogging behind the scenes of
the day Oh
he's gone yeah oh don't it that's why do
you want me to change the scrapped cars
say what if there was a video and it's
still a video it's just this video what
you've been blocking what would you mean
tell me what you'd say this this morning
when you out I started the actual videos
I'm surprising my she thinks they're
doing the whole scratchcards and then
I'm gonna keep the winnings and yeah but
I told them that I was actually gonna do
that so no no doubt me but you just
thought that we were sharing a video so
to experiment I was getting a blanket
knock it up sometime someone I'm quite
aware of that the outside in about place
with I he always always
oh it's a bit wicked before that we
really waved around about the game my
gosh I oh okay I'm confused
I need I said tomorrow and will it come
out I choose about the fur I wash it
died like yeah okay I'll pass test guys
whose nose Doris - guys stop around the
roundabout on the one-way system again
and then wait in the car she comes out
with full fro motion well she obviously
plants around the rocks out but
Microsoft and you guys can know it was a
very big success

end the video here I really hope you
