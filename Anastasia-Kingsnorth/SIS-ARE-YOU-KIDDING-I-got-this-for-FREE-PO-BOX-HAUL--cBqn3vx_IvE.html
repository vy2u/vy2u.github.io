gonna be really cool it's all like
bananas hence the massive banana package
so I've got this here which just says
I've got bananas on air it's like a
little banana case that's really cool
and then it feels like the stuff inside
it as well because it's really heavy so
I need to rip this label off so I can do
this oh my god okay so in here there is
some avoid shop banana shower cream
momentum stun amazing oh you know it oh
my gosh it sounds exactly like bananas
I've also put the banana body
moisturizer this is the one that comes
