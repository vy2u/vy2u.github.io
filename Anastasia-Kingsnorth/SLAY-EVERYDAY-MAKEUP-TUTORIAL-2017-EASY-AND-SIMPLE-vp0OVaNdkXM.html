my pain is gone my pain
everyone so for today's video I am back
and I'm going to be doing this slay
everyday makeup tutorial so as you can
see I have a bit more of a dramatic
makeup look today
ever since I do my makeup with winged
liner and lashes last week you guys have
been requesting a tutorial so so bad so
I thought for this week I would recreate
the makeup look I wore and show you guys
how I done it I love this look this is
literally going to be my go-to look now
now I figured out how to do it and I'm
getting better at eyeliner which by the
way I use a hack for in this video so
hopefully you guys can get better at it
too if you're struggling but yeah if you
do enjoy this video make sure to give it
a huge thumbs up and comment down below
your favorite makeup product at the
moment because I use a range of new
products in this video but I'm always
looking for new products to use so make
sure to comment that down below but yet
other than that I really hope you enjoy
the video and let's just get started
so I began by filling my eyebrows in it
with the Ardell dip brow pomade I love
this it's from the drugstore and it's so
good I then went in with my primer which
is the Smashbox photo finish primer this
is silicone base it means it's perfect
for my oily skin as I have a very very
oily skin if you guys didn't know that
already and just to go over that I went
over with the primer water also from
Smashbox
I really have to pry my face and my
makeup will slip off so I just add both
of these and as a combination they are
fab so then I went in with my L'Oreal
true match foundation now if you guys
have been following me for a long time
you will know that this is my absolute
holy grail foundation I literally love
this two pieces as you can see I prefer
to put it on my face in dots instead of
streaks I feel like I personally get
more coverage this way and I also just
pop it down my neck as well and blend it
up to my ears
but I'm just blending this with a real
Beauty Blender as you can see mine is
very worse for wear right now and I
actually forgot to wet it meaning it
didn't blend as easy as it would have
but as you can see the coverage is
incredible it just covers everything
really really quickly and as you guys
can see my skin isn't the best at the
moment so having a full coverage
foundation is very very important to me
but I just blend this right up to my
eyebrows as well because I do cover up
my eyebrows with a bit of a darker
concealer so I have to make sure I cover
that and it just covers all
redness and all of my imperfections
really really quickly and last for a
long time so if you guys haven't tried
this already I would definitely
recommend it it's around 10 pounds and
Superdrug or boots and it is most
definitely worth the buy next we're
going in with concealer and this is the
Maybelline anti-age or Wynd concealer
now I never really use this I picked
this up in America last year in August
so it is a bit of a different formula to
the one we have here in the UK but amber
has been raving on about it recently so
I decided that I would use it as well
and it is so good it's much more
highlighted in the collection one but I
feel as though it doesn't give me as
much coverage but I still like it as
this foundation is very full coverage
meaning I don't need a super high
coverage concealer and of course we have
to set our makeup into place so I'm just
using the collection sheer loose powder
and popping this on with a real
techniques blending sponge I'll just pop
this under my eyes on my nose on my
forehead and on my chin as I get
ridiculously oily and this powder gives
me a little bit of extra color back into
my face but it also makes my makeup last
a lot longer than it would if I use
pressed powder so I leave that on there
for around two to three minutes and then
I just brush it off and blend it in as
it can leave very very orange lines
which I do have to be really careful
about because at the beginning I didn't
know this and I would walk out the house
of the Renta lines on my face so just
making sure if you do use this powder
you blend it into your skin very very
well and it does give you a little bit
of an extra color which you may not want
I'm then going in with a product I've
never used on my channel before and this
is the Anastasia Beverly Hills contour
kit in the shade light to medium so I
just use the benefit kabuki brush and
mix all three of the bottom shades
together and just pop this under my
cheekbones I love this contour palette I
never usually contour I've only recently
started to do it and I can seriously see
that it makes such a beautiful
difference to add a bit more of a flush
back into my cheeks I'm taking the NARS
orgasm blush I love this blush I've had
it for over a year now and it's my go-to
I've been using it everyday recently and
as you can see it just gives a gorgeous
flush back to the cheeks moving on to
eye shadow this is my apps
favorite palate at the moment is the
Anastasia Beverly Hills modern
Renaissance I got this for Christmas and
I've used it practically every day since
so I'm just mixing the burnt orange and
the light brown shade together and I'm
just popping this all in my crease and
dragging it right down to the inner
corner I only use one shade on my eyes I
didn't want to do a huge I look today as
I'm more focusing on bold liner and
lashes but this just gives a nice little
neutral look to my eyes but it is a very
pigmented so be careful how much you put
on your brush and then as you can see
because my eye should have went very
soft and I want it to be a little bit
more sharp
I took my nyx concealer palette and
carved off my eye shadow into a dead
straight line where the arch of my
eyebrow would equal if that makes any
sense I usually use tape but as I'm
doing eyeliner I didn't want to use tape
until I'm at that stage and because I
didn't use many colors either I thought
it was pointless
see I just carved out my eye shadow once
it was all carved I then ripped a little
bit of this tape off I got it from
Target when I was in America and it's so
cute and then I just pop this along
where I just carved my eye shadow out
and I took the collection xtreme 24 hour
liner this is so good fun fact guys this
was only the third time in my life I've
ever done eyeliner so it isn't the best
but I really did try hence why I had to
use tape but I just use this all across
my eye and the tape really helps to give
a sharp edge I would never be able to
get as sharp as I did without tape like
look at this guys when I take it off
it's just it's just there like I can't
explain it like if you were struggling
use tape because I saw this hack on
Google and I can't go back I'm always
just going to have to use tape because
it give me the perfect little line so I
just repeated this on the other eye and
evens them out a bit because they
weren't exactly the same which of course
is fine this was my third time doing it
so I can't really expect it to go
perfect but yeah that is basically my
eyeliner I really do like eyeliner I
think it opens up my eyes a lot more I
never thought it suited me but now I've
started to wear it I actually don't want
to stop wearing it which could be a bad
thing because I don't like my makeup
without it now I then just remove the
tape and added some lashes
use the ardell demi whispies and then
I'm taking my Anastasia Beverly Hills
ultimate glow kit and a Body Shop fan
brush and I'm just popping this all on
my cheekbones as a base for the balm
mary-lou manizer and I just put this on
with a wet and wild eyed shadow brush I
pop this on my cheekbones on the end of
my nose my brow bone and my Cupid's bow
I think highlighter really brings makeup
together and I absolutely love it
I then went in with my lip color and
this is color pops Bianco I think and it
is so beautiful it is a nude but it has
kind of brown and purple undertones and
it's exactly what I wanted to complement
my eyes I wanted a perfect nude shade
that you guys would see on Instagram and
you guys would see as so laying I guess
but I don't overdraw my lips so many
people think I do but this is just my
natural lip shape I have fairly big
natural lips but yeah and that is
basically the makeup look complete and
it's a little bit more highlighter
because I'm highlighter obsessed and
there you have it there is your slay
everyday makeup look so that is the end
of my video I really hope you enjoyed it
let me know if you did by giving it a
huge thumbs up I love this makeup look I
tried my absolute best with everything
on it and I really hope you guys do too
because it has been so requested and I'm
so happy that I finally managed to film
it and it goes right if you did enjoy
this video give it a huge thumbs up and
I will see you next Sunday at 10 a.m.
