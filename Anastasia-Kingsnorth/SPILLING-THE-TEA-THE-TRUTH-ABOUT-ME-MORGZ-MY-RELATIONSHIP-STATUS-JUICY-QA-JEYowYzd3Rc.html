going to be doing a very very juicy Q&amp;amp;A
I have asked you guys on my Twitter and
on my Instagram for some questions that
I am going to answer and I feel like
there's so many questions that I get
asked that I just don't answer because
I'm just like it should I answer that I
should I just wait to like do a video
like this and address it all so
basically all of your questions that
you've wanted to know the answers to
this is the video I'm not making this
video in the means of causing any
trouble or anything like that I'm
literally just answering your questions
as I thought it'll be fun and I didn't
do to QA actually oh my gosh was it a
year ago no it kind of been a year ago I
think it was like earlier on this year
about seven or eight months ago I did
the duty Q&amp;amp;A and you loved it like you
just loved finding out a bit more about
me so that's exactly what I'm gonna do
so if you do want to be involved in the
next one make sure to go follow my
Instagram or Twitter there right here
now I really hope you guys enjoy it and
let's just get it started the first
question comes from Twitter and this is
jumping straight in with the deep end
and it says how much is your monthly
income now this is a question that I've
been asked before a lot of youtubers get
asked this question and I will not
answer it I just simply won't but I will
say that it's enough for me to live on
at my age and I am able to help my
family out I'm able to treat people and
I'm able to live comfortably with my own
money so that's my answer to that
question it's enough for me and I'm
extremely happy with it I would never
say a figure some of the youtubers my I
don't know but for me that's my answer
to that one I'm sorry if you thought you
were going to get an exact figure and
you were like oh my god I know how much
you earn now you're just not gonna get
that from me but that's why artists that
question are you happy for you're single
or do you hope to have a boyfriend
sometime in the near future this is a
really hard question because I am the
type of person that yes I really want a
boyfriend but at the same time I really
don't I have never actually had a proper
proper proper boyfriend so I would
really like
experience that sometime soon and
sometimes I do feel quite lonely in the
aspect of everybody else has a boyfriend
and I don't and it's like I would like
to have that person there because I feel
like it's a different type of feeling
from having a boyfriend to your friends
and you can talk to them on a different
level and everything's just different so
I do miss having that type of thing
probably shouldn't say thing but you
guys know I mean in my life
at the same time I love being single
because you get to have fun and that's
us so bad but you can just have more fun
being single and you're free to do
whatever you want I'm very independent
actually I'm really independent so
having a boyfriend would I don't know I
wouldn't hold me back that's the wrong
thing to say but like I'm just really
independent so I would struggle so yeah
there's like the two aspects to it so
yeah I would like to have a boyfriend
like if the right person comes along at
the moment just the right person hasn't
caught on for me but you never know they
could appear in my life tomorrow when
you could be in my life and I just don't
know about it but yeah at the moment
maybe I'm not really sure the next
question I feel like you guys are going
to be very very intrigued in and this is
probably the question you're here for
and it are you and Morgan and still
friends or what happened with you and
mogs it was quite a story that could go
with this I guess but I'm just gonna
kind of put it very bluntly put it very
straight and just explain what happened
I knew who Morgan was before I went to
summer in the city this year I've seen a
few of his videos I thought they're
really good so I knew who he was already
and then on the party studio71 do this
huge party on the Saturday night so it's
two days and they do on the first day
night oh my god did that make sense
everybody was at this party we were all
dancing and then I met Morgan at this
party we were all kind of just like
dancing together because people were
leaving and people were coming so you're
just kind of like forming our own groups
and stuff I was just half the whole
night but yeah I met Morgan there he was
really nice and then we just kind of
clicked like we had a lot in common we
became really good friends at night and
me SAFF spent we all spent some time
together and stuff it was really nice
and then obviously we have somewhere
50 the next day which was also really
nice and met those of you guys then on
that night we went out for food again
that was really nice I feel like I'm
just saying everything's really nice but
at this point it was good we went out
for dinner and then we stayed in a hotel
that night as we were talking for so
long and my last train had gone my last
train goes it's something like oh my god
I think it's like half night and people
just talking for so long that I couldn't
get a train home anymore so he said okay
would you stay in London so we just
stayed in London talked to mom we just
got to know each other which was again
really nice he was going on holiday
I'm coming where it's gonna I think it
might have been psych press but it might
not have been like the week after so we
wanted to see each other again before he
went so we spent the weekend in London
which I blogged and he loved you guys
probably would have seen those vlogs
because they'd done really well cuz I
guess everybody was just very intrigued
so he spent the weekend in London and
then this is where the confusion starts
because a lot of people were like oh my
god they're sharing a bed oh my god like
Morgan saying there go for an employer
and like what is going on I never stated
on my channel that we work together I
noted in my vlogs that we were together
that was all Morgan and I'm not like
slating him because he's a nice person
and we got along well but obviously you
guys know he's kind of known as the
clickbait king or whatever you want to
name him so yes it was clickbait I was
never his girlfriend he was never my
boyfriend we had that discussion as to
whether it was gonna become a thing
whether it was real and we got along
really well and obviously in the
thumbnail of his first vlog I think it
was called like dating a YouTube or
something like that we kissed
yes you saw that we had kissed so yeah
we did kiss but um nothing ever came of
it we were never official we were never
boyfriend and girlfriend that is
basically it we were always just friends
we kind of just kind of cut things off
after that weekend because I didn't want
to clickbait I wasn't happy with saying
that I was going out with somebody if I
wasn't because that's just not who I am
I will be very honest with you guys and
I don't want to fake it yet clickbait
views great whatever I'm not bothered
about that it really doesn't faze me
I do you too because I have fun
making videos but I don't feel the need
to click bait so that's where we kind of
split because we had very different
views on it and I didn't want to
continue being known as a Morgan's
girlfriend and everything that came with
that so we kind of just cut it off we
didn't see each other after that until
we went to upload me and staff went to
the upload party which was really fun
again we had a really good night with
everybody we went to London for it and I
saw Morgan again that night that was the
first time I've seen him since we kind
of like solicited everything off I think
we put it anywhere that we've seen each
other but like it was only lunch
socially in a group we just said hi and
stuff it was kind of like yeah it would
like had an argument except so it was
just kind of like a hi and bye type of
thing yeah like we're just not really
that good friends and then ended on this
one I get that it was an accident but it
still annoyed me so much he accidentally
leaked my phone number on his snapchat
and I got loads of calls and texted they
were like oh my god like a humungous
girlfriend like you're up dude I was
like what have you got my number and
there's nobody texting me they were like
oh my god mocha c2 number I was like
back up the truck and he'll be 24 number
oh so that was great like that was so
good but luckily barely anybody saw it
so yeah that's the situation that's how
it ended that's pretty much it next
question is what's the funniest thing
you've done when you're drunk well I
would be lying if I've said I've never
drunk but I am allowed to drink in
moderation as my mum does allow me to
have a little bit I've never been
absolutely gone to the point I don't
remember it I'd never do that but I have
been kind of like tipsy kind of happy I
don't really know it's like the most
funny or embarrassing thing I've done to
be honest there's quite a few story to
it though no make it to YouTube
I don't really know just kind of like
funny things with my friend if I think
of something like that I'll tell you
guys what was the worst YouTube drama
you have ever had back in the day I had
quite a lot but like it was
relevant so don't really remember it but
probably just this whole like Morgan
thing like loads of people got involved
like people started making videos and
then obviously it had the whole like
than if you saw it but Carly made a
video it was cool like this video will
make you hate morgues and obviously like
I was on FaceTime myself I don't if you
guys have seen that that was really like
the worst driver I've ever had how did
you meet saffron this is a bit more of
like a cheery question basically I have
known saffron ever since you started
YouTube I was already a youtuber and
I've commented on one of her first
videos actually I think it was her first
video saying I care like I love this
video like we should totally like talk
or something like that so we DMD each
other on Instagram and then it got each
other's numbers and then she came to my
house in April but we had this
conversation in November so it took like
six months but then we finally met each
other and you that's having that what
was the best juiciest thing that has
happened at a YouTube party you've been
to UM quite a lot but like without
naming what one it was basically we had
an apartment that was a few of us and
somebody end up getting a bit angry
because we didn't exactly want them
because they were very drunk we were are
we would just like please that we don't
really want to have a nap I don't really
want you here right now
I don't want to know who it was but yeah
we just had a bit of an argument that
didn't end very well and we didn't get
very much sleep that night so um yeah
two hours of sleep and you two drama I
love it if I had a crush on another
youtuber 100% I have I'm not gonna lie
about it don't know if I'd never go as
far as to say oh my god yeah I had a
crush on this person but there's quite a
few people in the whole YouTube industry
that I think is very good-looking
majority of them around my age there is
other people who do you think is good
looking but yeah there's quite a few
people who I fancy most embarrassing
moment in school oh my gosh I don't have
ever told you guys this story but
basically when I was in year 4 I still
remember it I had a teacher called oh my
gosh
it wasn't miss king it was miss
something I don't know I don't remember
her name but I felt so you know the
whole day I know I didn't feel right I
knew I was gonna be sick I kept saying I
please I need to go home you go home no
you're fine I'm thinking you think I'm
fine oh no I'm not
then it got to last lesson or lunch I
remember I was in absolute agony and
then it got to last lesson and I puked
all over the table in front of my whole
year for class it was so embarrassing I
went home and then when I went to school
when I was better I was told that they
put like this sawdust on it to like I
don't know what that does but they put
sawdust on it my teacher sat in it but
the teacher who wasn't in the room and
watch me be sick she sat on the table
when sawdust and in my sick so that's
fun
what is going on between you and Doyle
now I get quite a lot of questions like
this and I'm not really sure why because
I haven't dressed it before but
basically do is one of my best friends
he's always in a lot of my vlogs and I
feel like that's where you guys get
these questions from but me and Dawn are
just best friends I know we did a few
live streams together like back in like
February March where they could have
been seen as a bit all the friends but
no we're literally just friends we see
each other every week but that's just
because we're like school friends and
yeah he's basically one of my best
friends have you ever questioned
yourself about quitting YouTube um I
wouldn't say I've ever thought about
quitting no because I love YouTube but
there has been times where it just got
on so much with things that I wouldn't
say just people's opinions changing on
me just because I'm a youtuber and
people really close to me so there has
been times where I was like wow like am
i doing the right thing but then I love
doing YouTube so it's really hot but no
it's never really thought to myself I'm
ever going to quit that's never come
into my mind so I'm very avoid Mauryan
economy and Spencer well like no offense
but like the hundreds enter for each
would be Morgan I would probably marry
Spencer and snog commie who's your crush
oh my gosh that's a really personal
question
I do have a crush not that I would ever
name who that boy is because yeah I
don't know forever they're gonna end up
watching this video or I have spoken to
them but yeah
never would I name who is have you ever
snuck out the house to see a boy this is
so bad and do not follow my footsteps
here because you really shouldn't but
yes I have
count the house to see a boy I didn't
sneak out in the fact that I like
completely suck out among thought I was
upstairs when I wasn't I just told her a
little white lie about where I was going
but then when I got back I did tell her
like that I'd gone to see a boy and she
was fine she was like she just told me
and I was like yeah but like you just
have to do that one thing what you came
up with the rest of your life and then
tell the story like see a boy yeah it
really wasn't like whoa but yeah I have
have you ever met any youtubers that act
different in real life 100% I have been
to a fair few of YouTube event as you
guys would know and I would run homes
that say I've been disappointed with 70
or 80% of the youtubers that I've seen
there's a handful of them that I'm like
wow you're exactly the same on camera
like you're amazing but then there's a
lot of people that are just so different
and I don't think it's necessarily
because the numbers have gone to their
head I just feel like they lost heart in
it and they just do it because they have
to I feel like the whole kind of YouTube
spirit with them that's gone and I
wouldn't name who it is because that's
not fair because you know they still
make videos everything but there's just
a few people that it was really sad for
me to see because I'm quite quiet in
real life until you get to know me and I
find it hard to go up to people who have
more subscribers than me or higher who
are very big it's just purely for the
fact I feel like it's very like would
you want to talk to me I don't know like
do you have anything to talk about and
it shouldn't be like that at all
but that's how I feel so like it just
would have been nice if I all these
different events that I've been to if
some youtubers would have come up and
made an effort with everybody I know I
could have done the same so hands down I
understand but yeah I don't know it's a
hard situation be the girl who used to
do moshi monster videos you know what I
was I'm not even going to be ashamed of
where I come from I still have never
talked about it but what does it matter
yeah I used to do moshi monster videos I
started them when I was 10 quit them
when I was 13 14 and then done thought
princess so I've been on YouTube for a
solid 7 years and yes I did used to make
my she monster videos if you have to
pick any youtuber to go out with who
would it be
that's a really hard question because
it's bad
it sounds I fancy a lot of youtubers um
I couldn't pick one there's like a group
of people and like there's like girls
and boys in the group but there's quite
a few of the boys I really fancy and
that's as far as I'm going with that one
have you ever been out to a party and
bring a friend home with you
yes never a boy but yes a lot of my
clothes you got to a part in the lunch
we start sleepover and they end up mind
asleep around my house but yeah I have
what do you look for in a boy and what
turns you off so I just look for
somebody that has a really good sense of
humor or I love cracking jokes I'd like
to think my bunk is pretty good like I
have my friends in stitches sometimes
and they don't really for you just don't
want to admit it you know something
who's just really funny who has big
dreams and big goals in life and does
stuff with their life somebody that's
very like active not even like going out
for a jog every day but like they don't
lay in bed all day basically he was your
first kiss so my first kiss was a boy
called Jack and it was in year one - I
want a second one - maybe it was in year
three or four it was and I was very very
young but yeah do you want a youtuber
what would be your dream job oh my gosh
so I don't know if you guys I've ever
liked her me talked about this but I've
always wanted to be a spy or work with
GCHQ were my five anything to do with
that and keeping the country safe I've
always wanted to do that is what I would
have loved to have done if I wasn't a
youtuber I just find it so interesting
it's all my favorite things and if I
have any spare time I'm 24/7 watching
documentaries about it what don't you
like about YouTube I wouldn't say
there's nothing I've really despised
about YouTube I guess I just hate the
fact that there's still a little bit of
a hierarchy when they're definitely
shouldn't be I feel like this very much
a hierarchy still with the numbers and
like everybody has their set groups and
I wish there wasn't set groups I wish we
could all become just one big community
because obviously we still are but like
I just feel like it would be better if
everybody made more of an effort with
everybody and not necessarily saying
like go and collab with all the bigger
youtubers out there but just I don't
know - which we all talk to each other
more and that was the last question
be answering because this is are now
over 20 minutes of footage but I really
hope you guys enjoyed this little bit of
a juicy QA finds out a bit more about me
if you didn't remember to give it a huge
thumbs up you do be involved in the next
one that follow my Instagram or Twitter
and that's why I ask the questions but
yeah I love you all so much and I will
see you next week at either on Wednesday
at 6 p.m. or Sunday at 10 a.m. for a
brand new video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
