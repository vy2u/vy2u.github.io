going to be doing my 2015 School
Survival Guide so this is a little bit
odd doing a school video in like
November / December time because
obviously it's the end of the year
school time began in September but I
kind of wanted to do like a few school
videos randomly in between the back to
school series because we go back to
school at a few times about five or six
times really in the year because we have
quite a few halftime holidays and I
thought that this video would be quite
helpful as a lot of you have exams
coming up or revision or just and
looking for new products that you could
use whilst being at school so I thought
I'd be quite fun to kind of put together
a little school survival guide so I are
you talking you through my beauty
routine
and my favorite beauty products that I
use like in the school time my favorite
study tips and my organization tips just
things that are used to revise and
finally a few DIYs on like a binder and
some cute little accessories you can go
with it so I hope you enjoy the video
and let's get started okay so first
we're gonna start off with my beauty
essentials because you guys know how
much I do love beauty and I always use
it while I'm at school so the first
thing I absolutely love and this is
actually an addition like a recent
addition really to my kind of school
beauty routine and it is the use of I
love beauty wonder hand moisturizing
hand cream this is the most gorgeous
hand cream I've ever seen oh oh man a
little bit but it's just in this
gorgeous like rose gold packaging we're
just like you to fall it or label round
it and then it just has the name of it
and I love the capri packaging and it
just has a cute back black lid and it
smells amazing like oh my god it smells
so good and I've been loving using this
recently it makes my hands it feels so
soft especially because when you're at
school you're touching quite a few bit
it's really helpful the next item is
skincare based and I know sometimes when
I'm at school time I just can't be
bothered to do like a full-blown
skincare routine because what if I
bothered
until I don't necessarily half the time
so something right absolutely love using
because it's basically all-in-one is
Neil is Elle cleanse and polish Hot
Cross cleanser I've been using this now
for I think four or five months and I've
been getting a lot of questions how I
cleared up my skin and it is
the when I went early is our house he
pitched for house from the Isle of Wight
we had like a little skincare session
and I was told to like strip back to the
basics and just to use really basic
products so I just went back to this and
that is how I cleared up my skin I don't
really have any spots anymore and it is
seriously helped because I had really
bad skin at one point and it really got
me down but this has seriously helped
and I just like scratch myself but I
absolutely love this so I use this in
school time and I would definitely
recommend this the next item is kind of
foot base no I know a lot of people
don't actually like feet so I'm sorry if
you don't like feet I'm gonna talk about
this but it's just a cream and it's
basically the soap &amp;amp; Glory Hill genius
cream I think this is so helpful during
the school time because I obviously I'm
walking to school and walking around
school and to our front blocks and
everything I obviously get what my feet
kind of get a bit of wear on them and
this is so gross but by the end of the
week they just kind of feel like
disgusting and everything so on a Friday
and Saturday night I always like to
pamper them and I will always use this
because this kind of restores my feet
back to the normal place that I'm likely
to be at and to be honest it's a really
good price I think it's like five pound
fifty for a tube it's actually a decent
size so I would definitely recommend
going for this if you have trouble with
your money my next two essentials over
it Brandon really they're kind of nail
essentials because I also have my nails
painted a lot and they're very chipped
at the moment because I'm going to redo
them because it's currently a Friday
sorry there's a lot of background noise
so I don't know what's happening I'll
start my viewpoint now but anyway the
first two nail products I absolutely
love are the Maybelline New York doctor
rescue base coat and topcoat I always
like to paint my nails at school time
because I kind of feel bare without my
nails painted and I know some schools
don't actually allow nail paint but I
just love it so much like even if they
don't allow it I don't even come and get
in this top coat because obviously just
makes you those shiny and it makes them
look really nice and natural
so either way I'd only recommend using
these because they make my nails last
for so long I know need are discussed in
the trip now but these have lasted for
two and a half weeks which is in sane
and I know those disgusting cause I
haven't repainted them in two and a half
weeks but I am going to do that after
but oh my god these are amazing and
they're always on offer for like buy one
get one half price or something so
a really good price the vinyl school
item article beauty item to talk about
it for your hair as I know it's kind of
hard to wash your hair like everyone
every two days or every three days in
school time because you have part of me
I'm so sorry you have a lot homework or
anything like that so I had to use a
hair mask when I do wash my hair I wash
it once every two days because I find
this really helps in school time as
obviously my hair gets quite greasy very
quickly because I'm going out quite a
bit and around school and stuff so I
will use the Herbal Essence be strong
intensive mask I'm putting this on what
kind of like a wimp when I was around
Tesco I just saw it for two pounds and I
was like yeah let's try that we'll go
for this one but it smells amazing oh my
god and it's just so nice it's kind of
got like a honey ish send to it which is
why it's called be strong but it's
really really nice it has a honey an
apricot scent and it just smells amazing
so get this from Tesco because it always
needs to be on offer and they do a blue
one as well I haven't tried that one but
I love this one so I guess a blue one be
just as good that was kind of like my
beauty routine type part of it but now
I'm going to share with you a few of my
favorite study tips so the first one is
highlighting now I know this doesn't
help some people but as I recently kind
of done my first set of exams in year 10
which was actually quite stressful
considering I didn't really revise in
year 7 8 &amp;amp; 9 but your turn you really do
have to revise and it's kind of hit me
now how hard it will be but to help with
a vision I always use like a
highlighting tip so I had 5 different
colored highlighters and I will use one
for each different things to say yellow
would be used for this is going to be on
the trash you need to revise this or a
pink would be used for I know this and
then blue would be used for I don't know
this so I kind of know what revised and
everything is color-coded so that just
really really helps me and I would
definitely recommend doing that because
I something like scientifically proven
that it doesn't the help highlight it
doesn't help but I think it does for me
and I just like to share that tip with
you the next tip is taking regular
breaks now I know this is pretty obvious
but if you kind of sit there for an hour
and try and jam all the information in
your head it's not going to work because
that's what I try to do and I remembered
none of it because I wasn't like
allowing myself space
so what I did was I do 15 minutes of
revision like writing
repeating it taking it in and then I'll
take a five-minute break I won't when
you go on my phone I'll just kind of sit
there and chill and kind of just let my
mind
think think think freely and it's just
really really nice and that's how I
revise that's really helpful tip just
take regular breaks the next thing is to
repeat what you have learned over and
over this really helps me to say I've
learned something about science about
unknown redshift if I sit there and
repeat it like five or six times it will
go in my head and then half an hour
later if I repeat it again I know it's
in there so repetition I think that's
what it's called
yeah repetition yeah that really helps
me study I just that's a really good tip
so those are kind of like my three study
itch tips I also haven't done a few
others like make sure you're eating well
and drink a lot of water because that
obviously makes your brain function
really well and yeah obviously I'm not
that great at revision because I've only
had one trying it at the moment but
that's what's helped me and to be honest
my grades improved by doing those things
so yeah I'm not like a master Imogen so
leave your study tips down below because
obviously we can help each other finally
I thought I would add in a few DIYs for
you guys so I hope you're doing the DIYs
and yeah
so this is actually the world's simplest
DIY but I really love it I just wanted
to show you how I did it so I just got a
white binder and a glue stick and some
scissors and then I searched on the
internet for this gorgeous like rose
gold quote and all I did was print that
out onto some paper and cut it out it
took me a while to get the background
exactly white and because I had a white
folder I wanted it to match so I just
went round and cut that out and then
literally just got my glue stick you
know the basics and stuck it on I work a
lot better with my revision if I like
the look of my things and if it pleases
my eyes so that is why I did this and
yeah I just love this it's so simple but
it's a really easy way to just spice up
a plain folder so I hope you enjoyed

would be quite a nice video to do as
