going to be doing a school morning
routine for summer 2015 so the first
thing I'll do is wake up and I always
set my alarm for 6:00 a.m. because then
I have a solid two hours before I have
to leave the house so I can do whatever
I want and do it really really relaxed
so the first thing I will do is go on my
phone and check all of my social media I
will always do it in order then
Instagram Twitter then YouTube so on
YouTube I actually decided to go watch
my friend Ella who this is also a collab
with so her video will be linked down
below so make sure you go and check that
out as well so once I finish on all of
my social medias I will actually go on
YouTube on my laptop but this time go
and reply to video comments on whatever
my latest video is so make sure you
leave a comment down below because I
will definitely reply to your comment it
may take me some time but I definitely
will and once I've done that I will just
you know chill my laptop until it gets
to around 6:30
so when my clock hits 6:30 I will go
downstairs and get some breakfast
so on a school morning I don't like to
go like really extravagant with my
breakfast I just go to be so really
simple that's going to give me a lot of
energy for the day so this day I
actually decided to go for Weetabix I
just have Weetabix with a bit of sugar
on and milk and as you can see I like a
lot of milk on my Weetabix so I just
have that upstairs again and just check
my foreign tea if anything has been
updated anything like that and I can
just peacefully eat my Weetabix while I
think about the school day ahead
so when I finish my breakfast I will
just go downstairs and put my bowl into
soap ready to wash up when I am home and
I'll also bring a drink up for later as
well
so when my clock hits quarter to seven
it is time to go get a shower so whilst
I'm in the shower I will wash my body
with the soap of glory rich and famous
body wash and then wash my face with the
lid Oh cleanse and polish which is
amazing you need to try that and then I
will also just brush my teeth while I'm
in the shower as well so when I come out
of the shower it is usually around 7
o'clock which means it is time to do my
makeup so for makeup I'd like to go very
very simple for school like I don't like
to go very dramatic with like all
Foundation and everything like that I
just like to keep it really simple so if
you do want to watch a tutorial on that
I will leave a link on the screen or a
link down below in the description box
to my latest video which is a drugstore
back to school makeup tutorial and I
basically show you a complete drugstore
makeup tutorial that is exactly what I
just said and yes so definitely go and
watch that video if you want the full
tutorial
for hair with school honestly I just
keep it so so simple I just brush it
through with my tangle teezer and then I
will just split it into a middle partner
and put back my fringe behind my ears
this is just so easy for school and it's
just no hassle when I am there so we're
not my clock it's around 7:20 which is
usually the time I'm finished I will
just go ahead and pack all of my makeup
away and tidy my room a bit because I
tend to like leave my bed a bit messy
and I cannot go to school basically
without making my bed that's just me so
what I've done that I'll just grab my
earphones from my basket and I will just
put them on so I'm ready to leave the
house and then I will leave the house at
8 o'clock so I have a good you know
10-15 minutes to just chill before I
have to leave and on the way I will also
just listen to my playlist which again I
will link down below and if you want to
see what's in my school bag guess what
I'm going to link that down below too so
I hope you do a today's video let me
know if you did by giving a huge thumbs
up and I will see you soon bye Justin
