I'm going to be doing my school morning
routine so I recently went back and I
was like oh I actually wonder like what
my most new video was and I actually
realized that my school morning routine
for last year was nearly at 600,000
views and I was literally shoved and I
wash it back I was like you know what a
modern routine has actually changed
since then like the timings and like the
things I do and yeah so I thought I was
doing updated one for you today so that
is basically what I'm going to do so I
hope you enjoy the video and let's get
started
so once might absolutely dreaded alarma
struck me at 5:30 at 5:40 I will sit on
my phone just going through Instagram
Twitter I will leave my Instagram and
Twitter on the screen as well and yeah
I'll just sit there until quarter past
6:00 when I go and get my breakfast but
other than that I just sit there
watching YouTube and scrolling through
Twitter I actually have a few favorite
youtubers at the moment which I will
always watch in the morning the first
one is Daniele and sati
I love her so much she's like an
old-school youtuber and she's amazing I
also love Emily Canham her vlogs are the
best and I finally love Alicia Marie at
the moment her videos are just amazing
at the moment so as I said what kind of
this time will strike I will go
downstairs to get my breakfast so I
always get toffee crisp cereal in the
morning I mean it's probably one of the
most expensive cereals going and my mum
hates me for it but it is so good and I
absolutely love it and I would just sit
in my bed
probably on FaceTime to Amber or doing
something in the morning whilst I eat my
breakfast
at around half of six I will make my bed
and I will head on into the bathroom
where I will get a shower so I first of
all wash my face with the Iselle cleanse
and polish to remove any other makeup
and I'll wash my body using a lush
shower gel and then I'll just brush my
teeth in the shower as well and then
when I come back I always go on to
Netflix and watch the latest episode of
Pretty Little Liars i watch it every
single morning just so I can get exactly
what has happened in my head and it
always helps me for the next episode and
it's very strange but yeah I love doing
this and I put that on whilst I'm doing
my makeup for the day if you do want to
see my school makeup I have a video a
while back to win up and I will actually
have a school get ready with me going up
very very soon so yeah I will just do my
makeup by actually do my hair first I
don't know if I'm the only one that do
that let me know if you do that I don't
know but I always just straighten my
hair in the mornings and just brush
through it and then I will get dressed
and get ready to leave the house
once I have got ready and I've got
dressed I will start packing my school
bags I'll just have to go through my
books my art folder and see what I need
for that specific day and then I'll grab
my headphones and I'm on my way to
school some mornings I have to walk some
mornings I actually have get a lift I
was because I have to get a lift I
definitely don't have that option but
yeah I would you see the driving school
or walk to school and that is where my
school day will begin so that was the
end of my morning routine for 2016 I'm
really sorry I sound so bummed up right
now I've had a cold for over a week and
it is not budging but I love you all so
much thank you for watching remember to
go give it a thumbs up and yeah I will
see you next video
