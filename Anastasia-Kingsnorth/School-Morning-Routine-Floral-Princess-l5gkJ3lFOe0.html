going to be doing my school morning
routine for summer 2014 so obviously
it's a summer holidays this is my second
back-to-school video so once the dreaded
alarm has gone off I will hide and my
bed covers and just wait there for ages
and then I will finally go on my phone
and I know I shouldn't but I just sit
there on all of my social networking
apps Instagram YouTube kik Twitter I'll
just spend pretty much an hour on them I
will also watch so my favorite youtubers
in the morning and at the moment these
are my four favorites
happy is the heart that still feels pain
darkness strains and light will come
again so once I realized the time is
nearly time for me to go to school I
will go downstairs and get some
breakfast
so today that I decided to get some
chocolate pop-tarts because they are so
so good and then Ida took them back up
to my room with a drink and I ate them
while yet again going on my phone
finally I will do my makeup so I just
went really simple and I used a
collection lasting perfection concealer
and then for my mascara I went with the
Maybelline great lash
Oh
