because it's an amazing opportunity and
I cannot wait to come and meet you so
now I've told you about the giveaway
let's get into my school routine the
first thing I will do in the morning is
no surprise and it is going on my laptop
and phone I do this every morning no
matter how late I wake up but I usually
tend to wake up around 6:00 so I kind of
spend around an hour on my phone a
laptop just catching up on YouTube
videos that were uploaded after the time
I went to bed
I'll just reply to send messages and
scroll through my Instagram feed when I
am done on my social medias I decide it
is time for breakfast so it's some
mornings I will have cereal but other
mornings I'll have a smoothie so this
morning I actually had a banana and
strawberry smoothie so all I did was cut
up in strawberries and bananas and then
I just added them into a blender and
then it kind of depends how like
tasteful you want it to how much fruit
you put in I put more bananas and
strawberries because I wanted it to
taste more banana reason it does
strawberry and then I just added a
little bit of water and some milk quite
a bit of milk actually but I didn't
measure it I just kind of estimated it
and then I just blended that all
together and added it into my cut
honestly this is such a quick breakfast
and you could even prepare the fruit the
night before so it's so quick and really
really beautiful
I usually just eat or drink my breakfast
again at whilst going on my phone and my
social medias
now I'm going to be doing my makeup so
I'm actually going to start off by using
the little eye bright soothing eye
lotion and I got this a while ago and
it's just a real nice like think about
my eyes upon you my makeup cuz it really
refreshes them and makes them feel
really nice and clean I also just
quickly wanted to mention that I
actually have sunburn around here
because a few days ago I went on my Duke
of Edinburgh practice expedition and it
was pretty hot and on the first day I
got sunburned so it's been a few days
now but it's just starting to wear down
so that's why all of this bit is a bit
red I'm next going to use my little
super skin moisturizer and I use this
every school morning it's really good
and it keeps my face very moisturized
before I start with all my makeup
I'm now going to start off with my
primer so I'm going to using the body
shop all-in-one instable ah this is a no
like face primer and I only recently got
this and I've been literally loving it
so I've been using this every single
school morning recently I am then going
to go in with my BB cream and this is
the Maybelline Dream pure BB cream in
light and it has SPF 15 which I really
like so I won't get sunburned again just
like I did a few days ago
I really like using BB cream for school
because it's very light and it really
does give me good coverage as well but
it's not too thick and like as thick as
a foundation and to use this I'm just
going to be blending it with you know
Techniques expert face brush
now I have just kind of got an even skin
tone but you can still see my sunburn a
little bit through it so I'm gonna be
using the collection lasting perfection
concealer just to cover all of my
blemishes and I love this I've gone
through only four or five bottles of
this because I use it every single
morning for school
they're just going to set all that with
the Rimmel stay matte powder and then
going to go in with blush and for school
I like to have a very very light natural
blush so I'm going to using the real
Real Techniques no the elf twinkle pink
blush and I've been using this for the
past few weeks and I've got a lot of
compliments on it so I'm going to carry
on using this and then going to do my
mascara and I don't go too big on
mascara for school
some days I do some days I don't but
recently I've been using the collection
no clumps and I've been loving it now
I'm going to be moving on to lips so
first of all I'm going to need Liz Earle
super bomb and this is a really good lip
balm I've only recently started using
this but it's so good and then on top of
that I just go in with my Mario
exclusive lipstick by Julianne and is
the color riche won and I loved it
and that is my completed makeup look for
school for my hair on school days I
don't really do much with it I kind of
just keep it like this which is straight
and just put my fringe behind my ears
because it's very natural it doesn't go
crazy with the makeup it just it's
really natural and I keep it at my face
for school work which is obviously the
most important thing once I've done my
makeup I will give my phone one last
check as we're not actually allowed to
check our phones at school and then I
will get my school bag and begin to pack
it I do this kind of 10 15 minutes
before I leave and I'll just add
everything in that I need for that day
like my books my planner lunch
everything like that then I will pick up
my bag and pick up any leftover
breakfast and head out the door of my
school routine video I really hope you
enjoyed it make sure you go and check
