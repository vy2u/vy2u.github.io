at my school morning routine for 2014 so
the first thing I will do is click
snooze on my phone alarm because
seriously I do not want to get up at 6
o'clock
once I have kind of wake up I will go
ahead and get out of bed and grab my
phone and I just put on my phone on
Instagram YouTube Twitter I'll just sit
there for a while maybe even half an
hour 45 minutes
going on all of my social networks and
yeah I know I shouldn't because it means
I have to rush but I love doing it
after I once I've done my phone I will
get up out of bed put my phone back down
and I'll go downstairs and get some
breakfast so if I have like much more
time I would get like toast but if I
have to have a really quick breakfast I
will get some cereal again I will just
eat that whilst on my phone
I will then actually do my hair makeup
get dressed and make my bed so I have to
wear school uniform and I have a hair
and makeup video on why I drew for
school up on my channel so if you would
like to see that you can go and watch
that I will try remember to put the link
in the description and right before I
leave I will pack my bag just make sure
I have everything I need for that day
and I'm done
so thank you very much for watching I
hope you have enjoyed this is a collab
with very pink lips and Kate's place all
their links will be in the description
box down below so make sure you go and
check them out and I'll see you next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
