going to doing a huge shopping haul for
2016 so I do know that last weekend's
video was also a haul but it was a
makeup haul and I always do makeup cause
on my channel but I've never done like a
home where stationary clothing and a
beauty haul like all in one and I never
really talked about the clothes I get
like I never do clothing videos and
because I've picked up a few things I
really really love at the moment I
thought I would do this haul for you and
there's also going to be a giveaway at
the end because a few weeks ago I asked
on my Instagram like what items you
would like to see in a giveaway and most
of you said benefit to face and Mac so
there's also doing another giveaway at
the end of this video and another
giveaway coming probably in the next two
weeks I'm just going to stop rambling
now and I'm just gonna get straight into
the hall so I'm going to start off with
clothing because clothing as I said is
something that I never really show up my
channel and I'm not really sure why to
be honest but I picked up three things
recently that I've been loving so the
first thing is from butwho and I'm going
to do like an overlay clip of this I
think because I'm not gonna be able to
get the full effect just by showing it
but it is a split side gray jumper so
it's just a really light gray color and
then as you can see here it just has a
really big split side and it comes down
to just above my knee so it's a really
nice length and it's not too big not too
small and it's just really really cozy
to wear and I love this and it was only
10 pounds as well so oh that was really
good for a jumper and it's not too thick
that it's gonna be like boiling in the
spring but then it's not too thin that
you're gonna be cold and because of the
split size it allows like a bit of air
to get in so I think this is like the
perfect thing for spring so I will link
it down below but it's amazing and I
really do love this I then went to
Primark and I literally I never buy
anything from Primark anymore unless
it's like home where and I really don't
know why because pro might have some
really good clothes and a few weeks ago
I went in and I fell in love with this
thing and I had to buy it and I mean it
was like expensive for Primark
it's not expensive in the scheme of
things but for Primark I think it was a
bit more pricey it was 25 pounds and it
is like now that these have a name like
I remember what they're called and it's
really like it's like an overthrow
like a camel colored overthrow and it
just looks like this this is like the
worst thing of it and then on the back
it just has like a bow and it has like
little tied up sleeves and you just wear
this like over tops like this or like I
often wear over my green Topshop one and
it's just really really nice and I just
really love it and it's quite long and
obviously you can tie it up there so
it's like a coat I just really like it
and I really like the sides as well
because I'm a see they like flat Powell
it's like a waterfall coat waterfall
trench coat that's the type of thing I'd
call it but it was 25 pounds and I
really really love this so go to Primark
guys the final like clothing item I
picked up is an accessory and it is a
new bag I don't think I've actually
shown this bag in like anything I don't
even think and if you know I have this
but it is basically a really cute mini
backpack and this is from new look and I
love it so much so just have these
really cute little straps on the back
and then on the front it just looks like
this and there's a really big
compartment here where I just have like
a load of stuff and then it also has a
mini front compartment here I actually
also have like this little white bauble
that clips on the front but it fell off
so I've just put in the front pocket for
the moment but I really love this and it
was only 16 pounds which if I went to
somewhere like Topshop I'm pretty sure
it probably would have been about 40 so
16 pounds of new look and I love this
and then inside I also do have a new
purse as well which I got from Topshop
for eight pounds and it's just like a
little holographic rainbow snakeskin
purse and I thought this looked really
good in the bag so I got a new bag and
purse I'm now gonna be one two-station
me actually because I've picked up a few
stationary bits recently from home cents
and I've been loving them like I
literally loves them so much so the
first thing I picked up was a clipboard
and it is a very strange thing to pick
up but I really loved it and it just has
like a white marble bit at the bottom
and then it has a pastel pink with a
gold clip board clip and when you open
it inside there's like loads of room to
write like a stuff down because it's
like a huge pad of paper so this is
amazing it was only five pounds as well
which is really good for a clipboard I
think especially because this is like a
really popular design that I never
thought I would have been able to buy so
I really love this
I'm sent bargain please go there and to
go over that as well I also picked up
some folders and literally these are
what I dream of and then you know you
when you like sit there you like god I
wish I had this I wish had that but they
don't make it I found them so I found
these really cool folders and they just
say like things in like gold writing so
they sort its focus and then it's like
pastel pink inside and you've got three
of those in that pack and then I bought
three of these ones they all came in the
pack and these once a file and forget
how cute these and it also like pastel
pink inside so cute and then I bought
marble ones as well they also came in
the pack and they also just have like a
pastel pink inside guys just how cute
are all these folders like seriously
they were 9 to 5 pounds which probably a
little bit expensive but goals I also
picked up a notebook because again this
was something that I dreamed off which I
never thought they'd make but they turns
out they actually do and this was $4.99
as well and it's just it's not a
notebook and it's black and it just says
notes and it has it's like gold you know
kind of 15 pieces coming up from it and
then it's just like this and then it's
just full of paper and I love this so
much again it was 5 pounds but I thought
that was really worth the money because
I love notebooks I'm actually like a
notebook hoarder err I always buy my
books like especially from home scents
because they always have like really
good ones
so 5 pounds definitely a bargain also
picked up which is like a home where
peace from home scents and this is like
a magazine file it was ten pounds but I
really loved it and it just like it's
this triangle thing that just got loads
of triangles cut out with it and then
because basically I'm going to be buying
like a ladder wall shelf scene from Ikea
and I'm gonna be doing like a room
decorating video but because I'm redoing
like the other side of my room and I
wanted to buy some stuff to put on it so
like all this stationary and this at
magazines and stuff that's all gonna go
on there so this was ten pounds but I
really really loved it
so can't really leave it another home
where item I've recently picked up is
this little plant back here so it comes
in a white pot and it's like a big green
plant and that's from Ikea I think the
plant was actually three pounds and then
the pot was one pound as well
like four pounds and I how cute do they
look at my background cuz it's like
spring now and it's all like colorful
and like green and I love green and pink
like mint green and pink look so nice
together
and to go with that one I also picked up
this one and I've stamped it next to my
youtube a hundred K plaque which is on
my shelf that which you can't see but I
also bought this one and I really loved
this this one reminds me of like being
on holiday like a really tropical and it
just comes in like a black pot like this
but then I bought the white part and it
just stands in there and just how cute
does this look like I love it and the
leaves have so much detail and like
obviously is artificial and you can't
tell it's artificial but I really like
it and it looks really good next to 100
K pack I finally also picked up a few
lush bits fun facts I actually filmed a
spring lush haul and Pampa night routine
and I accidentally deleted it off of my
channel and I was so annoyed because I
pre filmed it for one week or some
people of this deleted it instead of
pressing edit what an idiot so instead
I'm just going to show you two of the
things that I have left I also did buy
the golden egg bath melt and the fluffy
egg bath one but I've used those since
filming and deleting that I recently
well not recently picked up but I got
the three bunches three bunches no bunch
of three carats and it just has an
orange one a purple one and a pink one
and it smells so so good
oh it just sounds so nice and these are
like so aesthetically pleasing they were
6 pound 25 which I thought was really
good because I'm gonna get like a lot of
bass out of these I finally picked up a
shower jelly and this was the bouncy
bunny shower jelly and I have used this
but I still wanted to show you it so I'm
just gonna pop it out and it's basically
a bunny shaped like it's the most
adorable bunny
you've ever seen how cute is that and
just to top it off it's not a terry
chocolate orange and who wouldn't want a
Terry's chocolate orange in your bath
shower jelly and it really cute bunny
shape I'm like you wouldn't want that
even though it's got everywhere my
huntable shiny now they can match my
face because my face is like a frying
pan so that was basically everything I
have been picking up recently I mean
there has been more home bits but I just
I'm just gonna say those like other
halls cut out this hall would be like 20
minutes long
