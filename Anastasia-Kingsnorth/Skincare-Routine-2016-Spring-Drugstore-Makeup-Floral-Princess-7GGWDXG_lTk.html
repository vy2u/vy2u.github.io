going to be doing at my spring skincare
routine and a fresh dewy makeup look I
really wanted to do a skincare routine
because I get so many questions about
how did you clear up your skin because
my skin at one point was really really
bad and about a year and a half ago it
was just covered in redness blemishes it
was just all for a really really prone
to spots but now it's kind of calmed
down a bit and even though I still have
a few blemishes and I still get a few
spots my skin overall is much healthier
so I thought I would do a skincare
routine I also thought it would be nice
to include a fresh spring makeup look as
obviously we're coming into proper
spring now and other blossoms out and in
spring I love to wear like jewy makeup
and it's more bit highlighted a bit of
blush very pink and that's very me so I
thought I would show you a tutorial and
how I got this look I'm just gonna get
straight into my skincare routine
because I'm really excited to talk about
the product first product is from Liz
Earle and it is the Liz Earle cleanse
and polish hot coffee cleanser so it
looks like this and it is basically a
cleanser but you can use it to take your
makeup off so it removes all of the
grime and the oil and the dirt off of
your face as well as like washing your
makeup off you don't need to use a
cleanser as well because it already does
this within washing your makeup off all
I do is take a pea-sized amount on my
fingers and I'll just run it through my
hand and then just put it on my face and
I always use circular motions because
you can push the dirt off of your face
by doing that I personally have
seriously oily skin like within an hour
my makeup will be sweating off not
because I'm hot not because I'm just
like doing stuff it would just sweat off
because my pores are just like so open
but cleanse and polish it has really
helped that and the oil has actually
gone down and type in using this and so
my spots and my redness this is like
perfect for every single skin type and
it is a really really amazing so this is
practically what cleared up my skin and
I will also use that alongside a hot
cloth and all you do is put this in
water and you can just rub all of the
cleanse and polish off with this you
don't have to use hot water you can use
cold water but I find the hot water is
more soothing on my face I will then go
in it was in a
our product because I've absolutely
loved nacelle they've really saved my
skin and this is the Alisa instant boost
skin tonic this is basically a toner so
all I do is pull a little bit on a
cotton pad and I will just rub it all
over my face and because I have such
oily skin it's so important for me to
like cleanse tone and moisturize because
I like to fight oil with oil and I found
that's best for me if you do have a
really oily skin I would definitely
recommend that but it's really important
to do this because toner kind of gets
all of the grime out of your face
removes any left over makeup and it
prepares your face for makeup as well
but I also do this at night as I do the
cleanse and polish because it's really
important to go to bed with a clean face
as well and finally like I said I also
moisturized so I use the skin repair
light moisturizer for combination at
such oily skin also from this OH I like
to use all of the same brand I don't
really like to mix eyebrows too much
because I feel like that's where my skin
does start to go bad again but this is
so good because it's for oily skin and
again this is really calmed it down I
really like the tube as well I think
it's very different or how it's in this
type of tube and the cream is so soft
and moisturizing and this is a really
good base for makeup as well once it's
so tint your skin is just flawless ever
since using those three products my skin
has gotten so much better and that is
basically how I've cleared up my skin I
would recommend those to anybody because
I use them every morning and every night
and my skin just was amazing after I do
that I mean I still get the off spot but
I am a teenager so hormones and that's
what you can expect but that is really
helped me clear up my skin so I would
definitely recommend that I will link
all of the products down below so as
well as using those three products as I
said because I have all your skin I also
like to use some other like cleansing
masks and poor strips and everything so
when it comes to cleanse and Martin poor
strips I always go for buy or because I
heard a lot of good reviews about these
and I've only used like for poor trips
in my life and by all ones have finally
been the best so these are the by or
ultra nose strips and their deep
cleansing poor strips as well so you
just like bend it put it on your nose
and you leave it on there for about 15
minutes I normally leave it on there 20
because I like to get the full use out
of the
product even though it kills that I take
it off but I might I to just stream with
water but it's so so good so if you're
looking for a good portrait and your
pores are really open and you need to
get deep down into them and like just
put out all of the stuff how disgusting
but yeah go for this as well I also like
to use Facemash a lot because as I said
how many times I've said this with it I
have oily skin but I really do like
self-heating master again I use the buy
or free your paws self-heating
one-minute mask and you just buy think
five or six in a packet for about four
pounds and there's just like a charcoal
scrub she's put it between your fingers
rub it all over your face and then rinse
it with water but it goes absolutely
boiling hot on your face which is so
nice and once you've rubbed it off you
can really feel that your skin can
breathe like you can just feel that
everything's been lifted out it's really
amazing so I would definitely recommend
all of those products so now I'm going
to my skincare routine there's not
really much to it I like to keep it
quite simple and quite basic because I
don't want to clog my pores up and plug
my face up puts like loads of different
products I'm now gonna be valen to my
spring makeup tutorial where I just kind
of show you a reading natural makeup
tutorial and it's all drops Dora's house
it's really affordable so I hope you
enjoyed this part the video and let's
get into the makeup tutorial so to begin
at my makeup tutorial I signed off with
the Maybelline Dream velvet Foundation
and I just buff this all into my face
using the real techniques tips and brush
this is really high coverage which is
the reason why I love it so much and the
colors pretty good match as well so
overall I'd rate this foundation 8 out
of 10 I then moved on to concealer and I
use the lobby old True Match
as you can see this is very orange toned
this isn't my favorite concealer but it
does give really good coverage
underneath the eyes once I don't
concealer I moved on to powder and this
is the L'Oreal infallible 16-hour powder
this is amazing it turns your makeup
matte instantly and love it it keeps all
away
all day I then moved on to blusher and I
use the sleep rose gold blush and this
is just the perfect spring color it
gives you the perfect flush of rose gold
on your cheeks and I absolutely love it
I then added a little bit of highlight
from the sleep contour palette onto my
cheekbones and my Cupid's bow
I think highlight is so important in the
spring I then moved on to my eye look
so for this I use the Maybelline the
blush nude so first of all I use the
second color on the top row and I just
blended this all across into my crease
and I then mixed on the bottom row the
third and the fifth color together and
this made a gorgeous rose gold shimmer I
wish I showed that more on camera like
it did in real life but it was
absolutely beautiful and then I just
added a little bit of the fourth shade
from the top row into the middle to add
a bit of a sparkle I then went in with
mascara and I use Maybelline the falsies
push-up drama mascara first oh I forgot
the name of it but this mascara is so so
good it's new to Maybelline and I would
definitely recommend it it is amazing I
just my eyelashes curl up instantly I
then lined my lips and with a Rimmel lip
liner and I didn't want to fill them in
Toomer so I just did it quite lightly
and then I went in with a bourgeois
Rouge Edition velvet in a nude color and
pop this all over my lips to complete my
makeup look so that is the end of my
video I really hope you enjoyed it let
me know if you did by giving this video
a huge thumbs up and let's see if we can
smash a 6000 line I know it all so much
and I'll see you in my next video bye
