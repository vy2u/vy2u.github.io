going to be a spring makeup essentials
video but what if you're noticing that
I'm in a different background it's
become I'm at Lily's house and if you're
noticing that the quality has just gone
from being okay to amazing it's because
I'm filming on her camera so if the
quality goes back down a little bit when
I'm back in my room I'm sorry but I'm
filming on her camera as I really wanted
to take advantage so today's video I'm
going to be doing a spring at makeup
essentials but also a pair up with Chloe
and Ella from phones Marie a little Ella
they have amazing channels Ella has done
a makeup tutorial and I'm also going to
be showing you how the products look on
my face and Chloe has done a spring
makeup essentials as well so make sure
you go and check their video out once
you have watched this one so hope you
enjoyed the video and let's get started
so my first makeup essential is the
Maybelline Dream fresh 18 one VD cream I
absolutely love this it is one of the
best BB creams I've ever tried if the
coverage is really good and I actually
prefer this one over the blue one at the
moment because it's a lot more thinner
and it doesn't take off as much on my
face and this is about 8 pounds to buy
and absolutely love it my next makeup
said to are these NYX blushes so this
one is in Rose Garden and I talked about
this so so much I absolutely love this
blush it is got less money to me
I got this from next because in like the
next in Milton Keynes they actually sell
Nick's makeup
my next free essential is the posy tint
from benefit this is just a mini version
and I love this too part of my lips
before I put on a lip product it gives
it such a good like nice pink tint and I
love how it feels
UND's me full of my lipsticks and
lipglosses my next essential is the
Maybelline lash sensational mascara this
is a brand new mascara from Maybelline I
absolutely love it it was about eight
pounds from boots and Superdrug
and the wand is really similar to roller
- it just has like really it's like a
plastic applicator which I really like
because I think they cut my lashes as
well as make them like quite stick which
I also quite liked but kind of my next
very essential are the Maybelline dr.
Eskew Baby Lips so these are brand new
album anyway they've been out in a
moment for a while but I'm so happy when
they finally said they were going to
come out in the UK so this one is in
Kabul cream and this one is in pink me
up and honestly I love them so much
there is three pounds 50 Tobias or 50 /
50 pounds no 50 P more expensive than
the other ones that you can buy but they
are really really pigmented and honestly
once I put these on my lips never go
chapped they just make the feels so soft
and moisturize all throughout the day my
other lip product which is my supreme
Beauty essential are the Too Faced
melted lip glosses phone is in melted
future and it's just a gorgeous dark
pink color I love these because it's
basically lipstick in a tube that's
basically what it is and they're really
soft on your lips they can go quite
drying sometimes but if you put a decent
amount on then they'll go a really nice
color and these are about 15 16 pounds
to buy on Amazon and I absolutely love
them so much and they're perfect for
addlesbury essentials are the Ted Baker
than don't body wash and body scrub
these are the miniatures and I love
these so much they I just love the
passive houses on them as well but
they're really good body prints
I haven't used a small version of this
but I do have the bigger version back at
home and I love it a lot and then this
is just a body wash and the real reason
actually bought these because obviously
I came to Lille so I needed them to like
travel-size but I'm also going to yard
with him like four days for another four
days so I thought they'd be really handy
and there definitely is for example
applying oil so this is the end of my
spring makeup essentials video I really
hope you have enjoyed it again the
quality is obviously a lot better in
this video but it will go back to being
my usual quality when I'm back at home
so I hope you enjoy it and like it's
easy by the cracks level inside</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
