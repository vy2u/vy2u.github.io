am going to be doing a huge huge huge
huge spring haul so basically I don't
know how it happened I seem to have an
hour-and-a-half stuff in front of me
right now to show you guys because I
haven't necessarily been shopping but I
did a swap box and I've been sent a few
things so thought I was put together a
haul for you plus I know you guys love
my whores as much as I love filming them
so I was like why not film one so as per
usual I'm not trying to brag or boast in
any way shape or form I'm just showing
you what I have got so it can maybe give
you some inspiration to go out shopping
themself or I don't know just to see
things that I thought yeah I hope you
enjoyed the video and let's get started
so I'm actually going to start off with
lush because I love lush and I think you
guys know that by now
talked about in a lot of my videos so
the first thing I actually bought myself
was the lush bubblegum lip scrub and I
got this when oh my gosh I got this one
I was in Milton Keynes with Lily which
was when I set around our house in the
Easter holidays and oh my god I'll get
you enough of this I'm just gonna you
sum it is it at all I'm just saying it
like is that it also oh my god you're so
good and this is like 550 and I love it
so much so um basically I got home the
other day and I had a huge rush box
waiting for me and lush had actually
sent me this huge gift set called lush
life which contains a ton of products
but I was in despair I got home another
day and I had another lot of products
from lush now this is crazy because you
guys know that I love love so much and I
go and buy it constantly like every time
I'm shopping I'm buying it
so I was pretty pretty happy when this
turned up at my doorstep I'm not gonna
lie so it comes with all of these
products inside but then I got another
package containing like some brand new
products that they're going to bring out
like some toning mortar so ocean salt
sea scrub but they're like different
versions so angels on Baskin
empyrion spatial moisturizer and then
mint juleps lip scrub so you can imagine
my face when I was opening this like
honestly I was like one of the happiest
people I oh wow you pee myself on a film
halls I cannot them whores I hurt myself
but honestly you guys know that already
but honestly I really recommend you go
check my shower even more because there
by now
the next thing I got I bought myself and
this was a new hair spray and this is
the L'Oreal Paris
Elnett satin supreme hold and honestly
this is supreme hold this holds my hair
like so so good like I have to have all
like with my callistonian but today I
actually had a Milton Keynes meet up
with Luis Chloe
Dani Ella and amber oh sorry forgot that
names there um and yeah okay oh my gosh
it held my curls in all day and I love
this so probably have to purchase the
full size even though it's a ridiculous
amount the hairspray files but on the
theme of like beauty I'm going to go
onto my makeup things so the first thing
I actually took myself to was a benefit
skincare set and this is gonna fall
everywhere if I hold this up any higher
so this was 1450 and again I got this
when I went to Milton Keynes with Lily
and it just comes with the face wash
toner eye cream face cream facial
emulsion which I'm guessing it's like
cleanser and a facial polish and this is
1450 but I thought it'd be good because
before I like if I do go by the bigger
size I thought it'd be better to try it
all out first so we've got everything
disclosure I want to film horse just
ignore me um yeah I would love this I
was only fourteen fifty which is true
for benefit skincare because you get one
of everything and this is really good
for traveling because I have quite a few
things to travel for recently the next
thing is brand new out from L'Oreal and
it is their brand new false lash
superstar mascara so this has literally
only been out a few days and they kindly
sent me this to like give my
recommendations on one that doesn't make
sense
well you know give my opinion on it and
I absolutely love it honestly it's like
a primer first and then the mascara
and currently in boots plus all right
States on introductory offer for $7.99
so I definitely think you should go and
check that out because this is honestly
one of the best mascaras I definitely
compare it to roller lash by benefit so
definitely go and check this out because
it leaves my lashes feeling like really
voluminous for luminous or luminous and
really long and I loved it the next
bunch of things are what I did it with a
swap box with Lois who I met today for
the first time and we literally screamed
hug to cried when we met so I'm just
going to show you some things that we
got in our swap box we actually sent
these to each other a couple of weeks
back well that was a really weird noise
and it came from my phone um it's the
first thing he got me was this Real
Techniques bold metals and brush and
this is the I tapered brush and I love
this like I thought I could use this for
concealer I don't know I love it and it
was my first real techniques bold metals
brush we go to around 15 things but I'm
just gonna show you the high end he got
me because if I go into all the
drugstore it's gonna take me ages see
first of all got me too much lipsticks
which oh my god he got me the Mac
Cinderella collection and this is the
royal ball and I haven't had the chance
to use this yet but the color is
beautiful so I'm really really excited
to try that out and then you also got me
velvet tell you which I have on right
now so can't believe I got bare with
Tony finally so thank you so much Louis
and this is already really really used
because I'm a bit this one's really good
as well got me used to things from
benefit so you got me any benefit what's
up highlighter and I've wanted this for
ages ever since amber went on holiday
last year she got at the airport and
I've actually wanted it for so long so I
can't believe he got me it thank you so
much he then got me benefits roller lash
at which I spoke about your Sony videos
should have bio chanda not sure to buy
it and even warm yet so I was really
really happy because I wanted this for
so long so he got me this and thank you
so much the final horn thing he got me
is absolutely crazy and I cannot believe
it is the Urban Decay Naked on their own
palette
what even is nice he got me naked on
their own palette I'm sorry but this
palette is like one of the most
beautiful poets I've ever seen so if
it's blind you because I'm going
probably well honestly put it down
it comes with the perversion mascara
glide and eyeliner making lipgloss five
eyeshadows it's a really really
pigmented and the naked flushed so thank
you so much to Luis because that is
crazy the next thing that I got was it
from Ikea because today again I had my
meet up and I'm actually gonna put some
clips in hey of what the meetup was like
I actually went to Ikea after and I got
this really cute plant which I'm gonna
put on my IKEA at nine drawers ready for
a makeup cut trim coming very soon I'll
have a ton of clothing items to show you
because I've really been loving clothes
recently so the first thing is from AC
fog which is an online store at Amazon
and I actually bought this I've had it a
while now so like I won't wear it as
much as I do
well as I did but it's basically a baby
pink boyfriend coat and on because it's
too big all over there clip of me
wearing it but it's basically a baby
pink boyfriend coat and I love this so
much it is honestly so so nice and it
keeps me really really warm so I love
that I'm gonna link that down below I
then recently picked up some stuff from
new looks so I first have all got this
high neck short-sleeved turtleneck top
totally made sense and it's just
basically ribbed
and it's kind of a creamy color with so
little bits and bobs in and I really
really liked this and this was ten
pounds I think I then picked up this
gray dress which I'm debating whether to
wear to beautycon if you didn't know I'm
gonna be at beautycon London this year
and I saw I know so many of you are
going and I cannot wait to see you I'm
going to be having like a proper
official meet up there I got invited so
I'm really really excited and actually
cannot wait but more competition and
everything like that will be coming soon
and I will leave more information about
where I'll be at beautycon so I love to
be able to tell you seeing cuz I'm not
100% sure myself yet but yeah basically
I have a couple of dresses to choose
well and I'm not too short one so I have
this one I really really like it and
it's just a gray high neck and it's
quite long but it comes above my knee so
I really like that and if you do want to
buy tickets I'm gonna leave the link
down below because honestly I really
want to meet as many of you as I can and
it's not just means going to be tons of
youtubers there like Tyler right please
sprinkleofglitter
Lillie Mae oh my god Alicia Marie so so
many other things I got were from miss
Kay
now Miss Canyon have been so lovely to
me and they decided to let me choose
three things off their website and send
me them now I always wanted to get
something off misguided but I've always
liked not gone to it straight away but I
really regret not doing that now because
honestly the quality is incredible
absolutely love it so the first topic I
got I haven't had the chance to wear yet
because I actually need to go get a
strapless bra all right and because it's
a bit of an awkward top to wear with a
like your bra straps but it's just
basically this white top and it has
these tassels at the end and you have to
tie it round the neck and you have to
tie it around your waist so it kind of
just I'll do an overlay and it kind of
goes on like this but I really really
like this and I will link it down below
because this is really really really
summery the next one they sent me was a
dress also just not going ton of makeup
and it was this pastel pink skater girl
dress and this is the other dress that
I'm debating whether to wear at
beautycon so oh I don't know but I love
this dress so much
finding missguided you sent me wear pair
of black shorts but I'm actually wearing
these right now so I'll just overlay a
clip of me wearing them but they're
basically in these black lacy shorts and
they are so so pretty I love them so
much and I'm going to be wearing them
load through the summertime so thank you
must guided for those I love them I then
caught something from she inside and
this is basically a t-shirt dress so
it's just a white stripy t-shirt dress
and I love this so much I just love it I
cannot get over it it's so so good
quality that you make sense but it's
amazing quality and I just love the
patterning of it and it fits me
perfectly so that will be linked down
below final thing I got in this haul I
just want to put a huge disclaimer out
there for because I've been saving up
for this for over a year now and you
probably won't believe me but I have
because I wanted this particular thing
for ages not just for YouTube for
schooling as well and I finally bought
myself my macbook because I had a laptop
but it to completely shut down on me and
I needed a laptop for when I do my PTC's
because I'll be starting those in
September and I've actually started
doing GCSE science now so I wanted a
decent laptop so I could do my homework
or my vision and everything on it
and there was no point me sitting in for
a cheaper laptop I didn't really want I
might have just saved up for one that I
really really wanted so I finally bought
myself here and I'm going to
do the editing questions now yes I'm
still gonna end on my iPad but for
Chatty videos I'm gonna edit them on my
macbook because it doesn't matter where
you edit chatting video because if
you're not going to be anything special
going on so I'm gonna edit chatter
videos on my macbook and all my others
on my iPad hope you have enjoyed this
video thumbs it up if you did and I
cannot wait to see some of you at
beautycon I will link the tickets to buy
them down below and I hope see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
