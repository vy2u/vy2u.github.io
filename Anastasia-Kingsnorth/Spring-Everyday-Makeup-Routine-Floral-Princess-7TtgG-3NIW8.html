have my everyday spring makeup routine
for you so I'm gonna tell you the truth
I have always put off doing makeup
tutorials because I am NOT too confident
about showing my bare face or just my
skin on the internet but I just got past
the point now where I'm just like you
know what I'm gonna do it because you
have all been so nice to me and you gave
me the lovelies comment and you deserve
just like see the real me
so that was quite deep to beginning of a
makeup tutorial but as I said I'll be
doing my everyday spring makeup routine
this is what I wear every single weekend
not school day obviously but this is
what I wear on the weekend it's just a
really nice natural pink spring you look
I really hope you enjoyed the video I
will just get started I'm going to start
off by taking my benefit Porefessional
primer because and this is my favorite
primer at the moment I do love to baby
skin from the drugstore but this has
been my everyday primer at the moment
I am then going straight in with my
foundation so I'm going to be using the
loreal true match foundation I've been
literally loving this foundation at the
moment it has been so good the coverage
is amazing as I do have quite a few
blemishes at the moment so I've been
loving this
to blend all of my foundation in I using
the Real Techniques expert face brush
this has been my favorite brush at the
moment hence why it's pretty dirty
now that that is all buffed into my face
and I have an even skin tone only taking
my concealer just to highlight certain
parts of my face and I'm retaking the
collection lasting perfection concealer
again to blend my concealer I just use
the expert face brush because honestly
this is the best face brush to blend any
concealer or foundation now I've got all
of my favorite base face makeup on I'm
gonna be taking my Rimmel stay matte
powder and my Real Techniques powder
brush just to set all of that in place
I will then move on to blusher and I'm
using these sleek rose gold baked blush
this is my favorite blush at the moment
I it just gives me a gorgeous like rosy
cheek as well as a bit of a highlight
and put this on my face I'm using the
real techniques multitask face brush
now I've got a bit of more of a color
back into my face I guess I'm gonna
start with my eyes as I do like to do my
eyes probably my face is not my favorite
to do but my eyes are definitely my
second favorite for my eyes I'm first of
all starting off with you Maybelline
24-hour colors have two in pink gold and
I'm just going to be using this as a
primer and a base for my eyes I'm
actually really using my Naked 3 palette
because this palette is just absolutely
stunning and I'm going to be first to
all be taking the color strange all over
my lid I'm then going to be taking any
color but I'm just going to be running
this through my crease
now that I've kind of got a little bit
of a pink smokey eye I'm just going to
take a new color factory which is a dark
smoky Brown I'm just applying that in
the outer corners now just to brighten
my eyes up a little bit I'm going to be
taking the color dust which is a
gorgeous light pink I'm just going to be
like running that all over now for eyes
I'm first of all going to use my
Maybelline the rocket mascara I'm just
gonna apply a light coat of this because
I do use different mascaras
I'd like to go over my mascara again
with the benefits roller lash because
this really lengthens why like eyelashes
but the rocket separates them so it's
kind of a really good mixture or a
combination of mascaras
so now that's my I look complete I'm
going to do my lips so first of all to
moisturize my lips I just use the baby
lips crystal in this beam of blush and
to finish my makeup look I will use the
Mac cream cup lipstick which is a
gorgeous pastel pink
so this is my finished makeup look I
really really like the turnout of this
look I don't really do this look on
school days but this is my everyday like
for like for call that n fit the weekend
look so I really hope you have enjoyed
this video thumbs up if you did and I
will see you in next video
