to be doing a makeup and beauty haul so
I know I've recently done one of these
but at the time I had done one I'd
actually been like picking up products
and stuff so I just thought I would do
another one they should also a collab
with three amazing girls the first one
she her name is Hannah Renee and she is
absolutely beautiful
sohow channel was Hannah my net will be
linked down below and she recently hit
30 meets 35 thousand subscribers which
is like amazing
so she you've done sort of so well and I
love her videos so much she has done a
spring clothing haul it's also a collab
with journey from just Jones I have been
obsessed with her channel for so long
and she's the most amazing girl ever I
love her so much
make sure you go and check her videos
out because she's come so far and she is
doing a makeup haul and it's also a
collab with alia from Ellie arose she
was on a cloud China called Digitas and
I was obsessed with the channel and then
we started talking and I kind of found
out but now a really good friend and we
chat about like YouTube all the time we
chat all the time basically so yeah make
sure you go and check her VD about it'll
be a beauty hook I'm gonna stop
blabbering now and I'm just gonna get
started with what I bought
so the first thing I picked up was a new
face wash I know I pick up face washes a
lot but I have decided that I didn't
like the Garnier soft rose while it was
making me break out even more which was
great so I decided to pick up the symbol
spotless skin triple action face wash so
this one is obviously from simple and I
love the green on it it's really a
luminous in the camera um and this has
like little beads in it which kills the
spots which really helps my skin this is
only about two pounds two pound fifty
from tesco and honestly I'm obsessed
with this I used this way before I
started YouTube and I had so clip so
that is the main sense I had a really
clear to get at that point so I'm gonna
start using this again and I could
already tell a difference so look there
the next two things that I got I picked
up from Amazon with some free gift cards
so I got my free gift cards from an app
called feature points
I always need it link down below and
basically you click Li
press download trust yes to everything
it's completely safe
you don't need to type in any details
nothing it gives you a list of apps you
download the apps and you play on them
for one minute and then you delete them
and it will give you points for each app
you play on and you'll save up all your
points for gift cards and I recently got
a 50 pound gift card just after taking
quite a while to get there like two or
three weeks which I suppose isn't that
long but it's amazing so the first thing
I picked up was another tangle teezer
so this is a compact tangle teezer I
keep this one in my school bag it would
have been eight pounds but I got it for
free and it's just a black koala I like
black so I think it's smart for school
yeah I just really like this hairbrush
and tangle teeters other best hair
brushes ever I would never go back on
any others the next thing I got free
which is the last thing I got free was
40 pounds and it would see two-faced
beauty wishes and sweet kisses tip would
have been 40 pounds but again I got it
free and it's just this gorgeous boar
just in and oh my gosh it's just so
beautiful so it just looks like this on
the front and then when I open it it
just looks like this so it has three
eyeshadows from the chocolate bar
palette the chocolate - no bronzer the
sunny bronzer and a limited edition lip
gloss actually isn't coming out until
spring like full on spring here in
England so this one is in naked dolly
and it's stunning and I just love this
palette so much I mean how could you not
love this palette it's stunning so I'm
gonna link all this down below so you
recommend you save up your money and buy
this because it's amazing the next thing
is are all from the drugstore because I
do love a bit of drugstore so the first
two things actually repair to tears
because you always have to repurchase
products if they run out so the first
one is the collection lasting perfection
concealer this is in fair number one of
my usual concealer I don't find this
highlights it more covers but I love it
because it's the best concealer I have
tried does take up a little bit but you
can cope it's amazing for four pounds 19
and
I love it I then got Amy powder and this
was the Rimmel stay matte n001
transparent never had a transparent stay
matte before but I'm actually really
liking it I prefer this over the
pigmented one the next thing I got is
from Revlon and amber actually got me
this for Valentine's Day along with a
couple of other bits so she got me a
revlon colorburst lacquer balm in one
three five provocative I am obsessed
with the Revlon lacquer bombs I learn it
a sorcerer peppermint tea and it's so so
good so thank you amber I love you lots
the next thing I got was a new nail
polish and this is the berry M jelly
high shine in white cheese so I saw the
floor C and had this and it looks really
really nice on her nails so I decided to
pick it up I actually have been looking
at it previously but then when I saw it
on somebody's nails I was like yeah I
need that so this is only 399 and
actually got it on often it was like
three for two across all cosmetics and
I'm obsessed with this I don't have any
nail polish on now because I'm gonna
paint my nails after this video but I
did have it on because there's a little
bit left of it but it's really really
nice
I don't love it the next thing I picked
up was a L'Oreal Paris collection
previewing lipstick and this one is by
liar or Lea it's Lea's nude and in the
shop they kind of have like like false
lighting so it looked a really nice very
purple I got out the shop and it was
like a darky Brown type color and I'm
not too sure how I'm liking this I
haven't tried it yet well I tried it
once but it like wasn't to go out it was
just to try and makeup and I feel like I
wasted seven pounds I wish I got Eva's
nude but nevertheless I guess I'll still
wear it but definitely not in a day
because it's quite dark
the last drugstore product that I picked
up was the Maybelline lash sensational
lash multiplying mascara it is
Maybelline's new mascara and this is
crazy knee identical to benefits new
roller lash the wand is literally
identical with the curve the smaller
bristles underneath lengthen and the
bristles on top thickened so I really
really like this and the introductory
price was $5.99 so I've got it
$5.99 but I believe in most doors it
would have gone back up to $7.99 now but
honestly if you don't have this already
you definitely should get it because
it's amazing and I love the packaging as
well my final things to show you in this
hall are from Sigma

am obsessed with stick for now so to
take my earned our new favorite makeup
