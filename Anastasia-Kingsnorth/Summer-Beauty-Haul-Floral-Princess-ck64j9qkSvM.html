huge summer beauty haul for you I
haven't done a beautiful in around six
weeks so I thought one was very long
overdue and since around beautycon time
I have been picking up so much summer
beauty products really and just things
that I need to top upward or things that
I have seen which I like what happens
with me and I tend to walk into like a
stupid rug or boots and I'm just like oh
that's pretty but I don't need it so I'm
gonna buy it anyway that is what most of
this stuff is except so I do need and so
but I just wanted so I really hope you
enjoy the video let's get into it I'm
gonna start off with some things I
actually bought today because I saw them
and I was like freaking out because I
love dr. Eskew
and it is the brand-new Maybelline dr.
rescue nail polish range the first thing
I got from their range was the dr. Eskew
nail polish remover it's not acetone
acetone yes no acetone I think I'm
saying that right which means it will
remove it so so quickly and this was
only $2.99 so I thought that was amazing
and it's actually a decent sized bottle
as well so I'm really really excited to
use this and of course when I went into
there as well they had some of these
nail polishes and they don't actually
have like colors so like they basically
just have a all-in-one base and top coat
or the base coat in the top row
separately so I bought the base coat in
the top coat separately this is a base
coat it's just kind of like a I already
know it's kind of like a murky past me
pink color and then this is the gel
effect topcoat and absolutely love them
like so so much I am a sucker for
anything doctor doctor rescue and I also
did have a few other bits so I'm
definitely going to be picking the rows
up in the near future and all of these
three things were $2.99 each whilst on
the topic of Maybelline I thought I will
talk to you about the other thing that
I've got recently and if the brand new
Maybelline master sculpt so this is a
brand new contouring and highlighting
palette out from maybe
it came out a few weeks ago and it is
currently being solved in boots and
Superdrug for around $6.99 everything at
the moment is buy one get one half price
so pick up this and pick up one of these
but it comes with a contour and a
highlight - in light to medium and the
highlights it's so so pigmented I can't
even get over it and then it comes with
a little mirror and also a brush as well
so honestly if you haven't got this
already definitely go pick it up because
it is incredible
the pigmentation is amazing and I think
this is a perfect palette for the summer
time so this is ranges from 6-9 to $7.99
but it's a hundred percent worth the
price I've also picked up a few Real
Techniques things recently as I never
really pick up Real Techniques brushes
anymore
so I have picked up the real techniques
your base flawless concealer brush
because I saw this on Amazon now so I
hope I haven't seen that in shop before
not that I needed it because I didn't I
just wanted it because it looked pretty
cool and I haven't tried it yet so I
can't give you my honest opinion on
actually how it works but I get along
really well with these like flat brushes
so hopefully it won't be cut much
product it will blend it all into my
face nicely and this is around $7.99
whilst on Amazon as well I picked up
another room techniques brush and this
one is then your finish perfected
retractable lip brush so this one is a
pink brush and it is a retractable lip
brush just like it says I absolutely
love it
it's so so pretty I've wanted this one
for ages it was not going to 5 pounds on
Amazon so I was just like you know what
I'm gonna buy it and I again I haven't
tried it yet but I'm hoping it's gonna
be amazing
now I'm moving on to a bit of skincare
so I actually ran out with my Garnier
micellar water and bakhoum I love it so
much I have to pick up another one
so I actually picked up - the first time
I picked up if they travel mini one
because I saw this and I freaked out
when I saw they had a mini one so I had
to have to buy it it was like I was an
Einstein peeing in Tesco it's gonna be
perfect for in the summer when I'm
traveling a lot because I'm going to
different places in England and yeah I'm
gonna need one of these but I also need
you one for home as well so I got a full
bottle one of these and this one was 2
pounds from Tesco and because I ran out
of the new why not no
the old packaging one I decided to buy a
new packaging one and it smells amazing
I actually prefer the new packaging to
the old packaging I think yeah I didn't
get holds more but I just prefer how it
looks and yeah tougher now moving on to
a bit of hair things because I know
really buy hair things but when I went
to beautycon London
I actually got given like a beautycon
gift bag and inside that bag was
something from OGX or organics and it
was the weightless hydration coconut
water and this smells incredible oh my
god I actually cannot even basically you
spray this on your hair before and after
you wash it and it smells incredible it
does it's like a detangler as well which
is incredible how many times know to say
incredible oh my god I'm gonna go back
and count when I'm editing but I
absolutely love this and I think it's
around $6.99 to buy but I got given mine
in my beauty cop so because I loved it
so much I actually decided to go and buy
the shampoo and conditioner so one says
organics or Montes oh gee X on it I
don't really know why but it's the same
brands it's fine that these were two for
twelve pounds which is obviously not the
cheapest for shampoo considering you can
buy shampoo conditioner for a pound a
bottle but these are foam up incredibly
you barely need any and I only have to
wash my hair now what took me three days
instead of every two days which is so
much better for my hair and it smells so
much better
I love this scent so much all of the
scents and anvil was actually telling me
about this that she wanted to try it so
we both have it now and we're both
loving and to go with that as well I
decided to buy the nourishing coconut
milk anti-breakage serum because I
really really wanted this and yeah I had
to get the whole set to match and I
think this was about $4.99 I also picked
up a hair spray recently and this is the
L'Oreal Paris Elnett satin hairspray and
it's the Lumiere
supreme hold infinite shine one because
I got I couldn't find it organics
hairspray because I do like to like not
mix my brands but I just had to buy this
one but anyway I'm still loving this and
I think
it's incredible the hold is amazing to
have it in today and it helped my
ponytail in perfectly so loving this
even though it is pretty expensive I
have then recently it picked up some
soap &amp;amp; Glory items and these are the
last things in this hole so the first
thing I got was the soap &amp;amp; Glory here
genius and this is incredible it is a
great formula which smells all my god
dub on and I absolutely love this this
is around 552 by and has helped my feet
sorry much wearing all of my new shoes I
bought for summer and finally today I
actually did a three for two in boots on
the soap &amp;amp; Glory so the first thing I
got was it the same Android flake away
scrub and Amber absolutely adored this
and I hadn't personally properly tried
it so I started to pick it up it smells
incredible it's so perfect in the pot
and this is 8 pounds
but it is a very very big pot look at
that compared to my face I then got the
rich and famous body wash from soap &amp;amp;
Glory because I've had this previously
and it smelt incredible so I'll just
like you know what let's fight again
let's do it oh yeah that was incredible
and it was only 650 as well and cuz it
was sweet too got it for free lost a
bargain and finally I then got the oh
what's that oh god okay I hate it when
stuff show through the bottle there we
go I got the ahsoka Lewis really start
deep moisture body milk and this is just
in the tub like this and it looks
incredible and smells even better it
smells just like rich and famous which
is why I bought it and this was 10
pounds but that is everything in my haul
video today I really hope you enjoyed it
thumbs it up if you did and let me know
if you would like me to carry on doing a
ton of summer halls for you I really
hope you enjoyed the video thumbs it up
and let's get it to 3.5 K lights because
I definitely know you can do that I love
you all so much and I'll see you soon
