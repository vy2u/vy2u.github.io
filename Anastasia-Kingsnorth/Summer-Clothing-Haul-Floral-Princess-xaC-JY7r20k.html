going to be doing a summer clothing haul
so before I start I just need to get
this out there there's just the fourth
time I've filmed this video because my
hair isn't either going right it's
wobbly doesn't even look right but you
know I'm gonna go over there and I'm
going to it's keep going out focus and
I'm slightly getting annoyed now so I
truly hope this time worked so for
today's video I'm gonna be doing a
summer clothing haul but it's not going
to be a summer clothing haul appropriate
for the Bahamas a Hawaii order by
because you know I would love to go to
those places but sadly I'm not and I'm
staying in England
therefore I've gone to summer clothes
shopping for England appropriate summer
weather I hope I have got things from
Primark can you look at H&amp;amp;M as a part of
the main shops I have shopped him
recently and yeah I hope you enjoy the
video and let's just get started so the
first thing I've picked up is a top from
Primark and this stuff is very recent I
only went yesterday so you can
definitely still go buy it so it is just
this gorgeous white embroidery to read
edge top and it's really really flowy
it's just a very long flowy top and
we've also got it along the edge and it
would just like hang off my shoulder a
little bit
really really baggy and flowy which I
really like and this was only 5 pounds
so I definitely had to get that because
it's amazing the other top I got from
Primark is kind of similar it's plain
white again but it has this gorgeous
little scalloped edge with these pretty
little flower cutouts
it's like that on the arms at the neck
and then it's also like that on the edge
and this is so pretty again it was only
5 pounds so how can you go wrong I mean
like Primark flows are incredible so
yeah I absolutely love this and I'm
gonna be wearing those two tops so much
through the summer next thing I got from
Primark is this gorgeous Brown Fedora so
when I wear it with a pony tail I look
like Perry from Phineas and Ferb but you
know I'm just gonna I'm gonna not wear
it like that I'm gonna wear it with my
hair either down straight or down and
curly because I smell it really nice
like that it just has this gorgeous
little brown ribbon e-type thing around
the edge it it kind of looks like the
classic cowboy hat but it's not when you
have it on because it going round on
your head and then this is really floppy
so you can kind of do it
and you want to have it and yeah I
really like this and this was only eight
pound I then call some short but I did
get these a while ago but I don't know I
saw them in that yesterday so you can
still get them but I don't know if I
show you these in a hope so I'm just
gonna show you them anyway and they are
these blue and white crochet shorts I
guess they're not hot pants because you
know I'm not gonna wear hot pants but
they are very short shorts and they're
kind of a cottony material they have to
fake pockets at the front and then they
have a zip at their back and these are
only five pounds a lot of prime up stuff
is five pounds which I really like and
yeah I'm gonna be wearing these a lot
the next thing I've got it an item of
jewelry and I wanted this ever since I
saw it on Danny I actually got an exact
copy of Danny's necklace it's the two
coins but it was really really big and
then I went into Primark and I saw this
dainty little golden coin and I was like
okay I need to have this in my life
so it's just this gorgeous little gold
coin and it is on this tiny dainty chain
and this is gonna look so good on top of
all those white tops because oh my god
it's so pretty and it was only 150 I
then have thermos sunglasses so these
are the cat eye effect sunglasses and
they have an ombre lens and they are so
so pretty I love them so yeah I just
love these and they're only 150 and
looking pretty stout in them or are they
slanted furless wanted okay we have an
issue the next things I got awesome
shoes and these are the pastel pink
paint shoes and they are also from
Primark they were 12 pounds and they are
just so gorgeous so I already have
scrapped on them that's really
depressing because I only got these
yesterday and they just are black at the
bottom with this cute little heel and
I'm going to wearing these so much
through the summer time because these
are more England appropriate summer
shoes I then went to new look and I
picked up some trousers so I actually
bought these two beautycon so I've had
these about three weeks now but these
are these tribal print black-and-white
triangle trousers those have have a
black button they were seven pounds in
the new-look sale and they are so nice
they are very very long
and then like cuff up the edge at the
bottom if you wanted to and I love these
ugly wearing these with a ton of white
tops and my Perry hat the final thing I
got is from H&amp;amp;M and it is a white shock
peplum top and it just looks like this
at the end it's all peplum and it's so
pretty this is going to look so good
with Pat and Charles's jeans that hat
the necklace as you can see I shop why
do it when I go shopping I shop in
outfit so I like to buy a complete
outfit and this is only four pounds so
definitely pick these up they also have
them in a ton of different colors that
is the end of my clothing haul I really
hope you enjoyed it I know it was a very
big but this is just an idea of some of
the things you could get I obviously
will go summer shopping like closer to
the time as well and I would do another
haul but let me know if you enjoyed this
well by giving a huge thumbs up let's
try and thrash 3.5 K lights because I
know you can do that I love you all so
much I love you all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
