going to be doing a summer morning
routine kind of I could get ready with
me video so the first thing I will do my
morning routine which is what I do in
every morning routine like every other
youtuber and that is check my phone I'll
first move onto Instagram because
Instagram is basically my life I'm for
every one Instagram so if you want to
follow it I will leave the link to mine
down below as well all of my other
social medias I then decide to watch my
pale skin on YouTube because her videos
are amazing especially all of her acne
coverage makeup tutorials and then I'll
just go on my laptop and start replying
to some video comments and do things
like that and reply to emails so I first
of all turn to my back to school haul
which is my latest video and I just
replied to you some of your comments on
there as I always reply to my comments
so make sure you leave them down below
if you want a reply I will then again to
check my phone reply to any messages
before I will head downstairs to go and
get some breakfast
for my back but recently I've been
really into having more hot things even
though it's summer I'd prefer to have
I've noticed a different breakfast I
decided to have some fried eggs this
morning so I did was heat up some oil in
the frying pan and then I just cut open
two egg shells and put them in the pan
and then just let them cook and I had
them on my plate I decided not have any
toys with them because I don't know I'm
not that big of a fan of toast so I just
had my eggs for breakfast
I then also just got myself a glass of
summer fruits because oh my god guys
this stuff is incredible
I love it so much and I'm forever
drinking this I then just go upstairs
and eat all of that once I finish eating
my breakfast I'm doing whatever I do
after that I will finally make my bed so
I decided to put all my curtains on my
bed and straighten out the duvet and
I'll then pick my outfit for that day
and let it on my bed ready for after
I've been into the bathroom so first of
all go take a freezing cold shower
because I'm really into taking cold
showers lower using soap and glory rich
and famous shower gel and the EOS shave
cream whilst I'm in there and then I
will come out of the shower and wash my
face so I'm using the clean and clear
and whit morning first face wash and
I've really been loving clean and clear
at the moment it really cleared up my
skin and made a big difference
I'll then just Pat my face dry and also
it brush my teeth using the white flow
toothpaste
we are now on to my favorite part which
is the makeup so I first of all started
with the baby skin cool Rose instant
fatigue blur and I just blended that all
in with my fingers I then took my
L'Oreal true match foundation in rose
ivory and I dotted this all over my face
and first of all started blending it
with the Real Techniques buffing brush
which I recently cleaned so that is why
I've been loving it so much and I then
just double checked it was all blended
with my Real Techniques expert face
brush I then just set that all with some
Rimmel concealer I usually match
perfection instead of D collection today
because I didn't feel like I needed as
much coverage I then just applied a fit
me powder and the sleek rose gold blush
and then I applied a highlighter which
was Italy balm mary-lou manizer on my
cheekbones my Cupid's bow and then just
a little bit down the middle of my nose
I then went in with some mascara the Too
Faced better than sex which I'm loving
and then I went in with my favorite
Maybelline lash sensational just to make
the lashes a bit of thicker and more
black I then finally applied a bourgeois
like matte lip thing and this was in
like a nude color and that was my makeup
completed
so this day I actually went down to
understand turn with my best friend
amber and my family so I just decided to
show you my outfit so my white vest top
is from new look it was in a sale for
three pounds and my shirt it's also from
new look it cost twenty pounds and then
my jeans are guess what from new look
and then my shoes are from Primark I
love this outfit is very summery and we
had an amazing time at the beach we just
chilled and we went on some of the fair
eyes and it was really really fun so
thank you very much for watching I
really hope you enjoyed it and I will
see you soon bye Justin the cracks of
