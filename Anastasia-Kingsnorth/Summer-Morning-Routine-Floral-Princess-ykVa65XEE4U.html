everyone so for today's video I am going
to be doing a summer morning routine I
wanted to do Oh like updated summer
morning routine ever since last summer
when I kind of really got into my
channel and finally because it's
becoming a bit warmer even though it's
like chucking it down with rain right
now I thought I would do one so this is
also a collaboration video with my best
friend amber she has really got into
YouTube recently as use absolutely
loving making videos I think she's got
six videos up at the moment and she is
also going to be doing the morning
routine
I'm actually on FaceTime with her right
now and she is filming hers so yeah hope
you enjoy the video make sure you go and
check amaz video out it will be a link
down below in the description box and
left in the video
so when I wake up on a summer morning
the first thing I will always do is
check my phone I usually wake up around
8 to 9 o'clock and I would just sit on
my phone for a good 10 15 minutes until
I get bored of going on my phone and
then I will turn on my laptop and at the
moment I've been loving watching like
the only OSS it's on Netflix and
catching up on Pretty Little Liars even
I've watched the whole series I need to
get ready for when the new season starts
because we're going to find out who a is
so when I have done that I will just get
some shoes on shoes no get my socks on
and get ready to go down the stairs on
summer mornings I don't really like to
have something too hot or something
that's going to take forever to make so
I'll just go with a really simple
breakfast of cereal and a piece of fruit
so today I just have like these we toe
chocklit hoop things and then to go with
that I just had a banana and I just like
to cut my banana up and then I'll like
eat it at the same time as eating my
cereal and yeah as you can see the my
banana went everywhere but I just took
it upstairs on the little chopping board
and I just sat and ate my wee toes and
my banana whilst again sitting on my
phone and a laptop watching some more
Netflix
when I've done like lounging around I'll
finally make my bed because I cannot
move on with my day unless I make my bed
so I'll just like you know make my bed
and put all of my cushions on it and
then just put my laptop down and then I
will move on to skincare so I first of
all use my Garnier micellar cleansing
water and this is just to remove any
leftover makeup from the night before
and to moisturize I will use a little
super skin moisturizer for combination
skin now we'll just put this all over my
face once I've done with my skincare I
like to choose my outfit for the day so
it really varies what I wear but I
actually decided to wear some things
from boohoo so I just wore some normal
black leggings but these one from boohoo
and then I chose this pink scalloped top
which is from boohoo and I just leave
those on my wardrobe until I've done
with my bar
so I've actually really been into taking
morning baths recently I feel a lot
cleaner and because I've been to
sweating so much when I sleep I just
much prefer to take a morning bath so in
the bath I'll just wash my body over
with the soap and or we clean on me and
then I will always exfoliate with the
smoothie style breakfast scrub and I'll
just put this all over my legs and my
chest area and this just gets me ready
for the day and I feel so good after
taking a morning bar once I'm at the
baths and I've brushed my teeth and
everything like that I will choose all
of my makeup so as you can see my makeup
is stored very differently now as I
order some more separators and now have
five drawers so if you do want to see an
updated makeup collection let me know
and I will definitely do one of those
for you now moving on to makeup so
because it's a summer morning and it's
pretty hot I just like to go for
something pretty lightweight so I just
usually lower your true match foundation
as my base and then the collection
lasting perfection concealer under my
eyes on my chin and around my nose area
just to cover all of my imperfections
and then to set all that old your shoes
and your Rimmel stay matte powder I'll
then going in with my sleek rose gold
blush on my cheeks and I do put quite a
lot on because it wears off pretty
easily and then it just leaves me with a
nice pretty glow and I will then go in
with my benefit roller lash mascara and
this is the only mascara I will use
during the summer because it's amazing
and finally I will use my benefit pony
bomb and that completes my summer look
I hope it's not me that is the only
person that wakes up with some crazy bed
hair so I just took it out of the
ponytail and I brushed it all out and I
just decided to take a bit of my fringe
over to more over the one side and I
just literally ponytail them back just
to keep it out of my face because it's
pretty windy and then I can just have it
all out of my face and I think it looks
really simple and pretty with the makeup
look to finish my morning routine at
home I will pack my handbag and choose
some shoes to go out in so I decided
just to go with these plain pink like
slip-on shoes from Primark and I'll just
put them on and I'm ready to leave the
house for my outfit I wanted to go for a
very casual summer's day look so my
jeans and my shoes are both from new
look and then my top and my white
boyfriend blazer is from boohoo I'm
literally obsessed with both of them I'm
gonna link them down below because they
are incredible I just out Italy loved it
and I've been wearing them so much
recently in the cracks of the landslides</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
