going to be doing my summer pamper
routine I always get really requested to
do like pamper routine videos but I
never really want to film my pamper you
things because I want them to be
relaxing but tonight because I'm going
to be having one I'm really in the mood
to film it so I thought I would sit down
and film it for you so I am going to
talk you through it in overnight
different clips of what I did because I
much prefer those type of pamper
routines and I really hope you enjoy the
video the first thing I will do when I
have a pamper routine is I will come in
my room and I will just check a social
media I cannot do a pamper routine
without doing this I just have to make
sure that I'm all caught up on my
Instagram my Twitter YouTube
subscriptions everything like that
before I actually start to pamper myself
so this is definitely part of my
pampering but it may not be part of
yours mine is cleaning my room I have to
clean my room on an everyday basis when
I have a pap routine I don't feel
pampered unless my room is all clean and
tidy so I will just go over and make my
bed just clean over with like some wipes
clean my windows just to make sure that
everything smells really fresh and I'll
finalize it by lighting a candle most
probably my Yankee Candle in sugar
dapple because that smells incredible
and because my room is pretty small it
really really fills the air very quickly
and it smells amazing once I have done
that I will begin to pick out all of my
bath products
so I might have a bath on hand the
evening even though it is summertime I
just don't feel like showers are
relaxing but of course you can have a
shower if you prefer that I just
personally prefer to have baths so in
the bath I first of all would use the
zoella Beauty fresh fist fragrance bar
so I used to use the old one but then
she bought out her new tutti frutti
range which I love and I recently picked
up this and the shower gel so this is
definitely going to become part of my
pamper routine but I haven't used this
yet so I'm really excited to use this
tonight when I have it instead of it
being an 8 rope that is in 4 chunks and
the chunks are bigger so I'm very
excited to see what this is going to do
in my bar at the moment I'm actually out
of lush products then as I would have
probably used one but I'm actually out
the my
I don't have any bath bombs any bubble
bars I need to go to that ASAP and do a
little shopping spree in there because I
cannot live without lush algae makes me
feel so upset but I don't have any right
now so because I don't have any lash
that is practically all I will use in my
bath I just like to have it plain if I
have less I wouldn't but if I don't I
just like to have it plain adjust the
water and a few little bubbles so whilst
I'm in the bath there are several
products that I will use I will use the
soap and glory rich and famous shower
gel because I love soap and glory
products they are definitely one of the
best shower ranges and bath ranges I've
ever came across and to go with that I
will also use the soap &amp;amp; Glory smoothie
start ocean and breakfast scrub I
love this so much this is my third pot
fish and it's going down pretty fast oh
my god it smells incredible I've got all
this set again because they smell really
really nice and they actually smell
pretty familiar as well so I like to use
a matching sense so if I washing my hair
in the bath I'm not hundred percent sure
I will go wash it tonight but if I am I
decided to show you what I would use so
if I was I would use the nourishing
coconut milk shampoo and conditioner
from the brand OGX organics I love this
shampoo and conditioner it makes my hair
so really really nice just like coconut
and yeah I love it it's amazing so while
my bath is running I like to do it a
little bit of skincare so for my
skincare or we use the Garnier skin
naturals and micellar cleansing water
this is a brand new one that I'm going
to the opening tonight so I'm very very
excited about that this is amazing
they actually have a new bottle of it
like the bottle design is different
which I much prefer I love this design
and I cannot wait to use this so I'll
just use this to remove all of my makeup
if there's still a bit of leftover
makeup on then I will use a simple kind
of skin facial wash just to remove the
rest of that so before I get in the bath
I like to put a face mask on so recently
I have been using the feeling beautiful
chocolate and strawberry clay mask I've
never really heard of this brand before
I just saw it in Tesco and I was like
all that studying is quite good because
I read the back and it says it will help
absorb your pores and at the moment I'm
having a bit of a pull issue they are
very open from when I did my Duke of
Edinburgh
position because I was outside obviously
and yeah they need sorting out so this
is the perfect mask for that and it does
I know it's not to be like chocolaty
caramely type it's really really nice
it's a brownie color yeah I love this
whilst I'm in the bath I will just
lights and candles and just relax and
chill I'll just probably read a magazine
or as per usual go on my phone again
check up on with social medias and
everything like that so when I'm in the
bath elbows enter shoes my soap and
always scrub and my shower gel and most
probably shave my legs as well because I
love to shave my legs on a pamper night
when I'm out at the bar the first thing
I would do is just remove my face mask I
don't like to leave my face mask on like
while I'm doing all of my bodily
skincare I just like to get it off
straightaway scene sign out so I have a
fresh face ready for moisturizer so I
will then draw my body over and over
there like to moisturize so to match all
of my soap &amp;amp; Glory I like to moisturize
with this movie star deep moisture body
milk again I showed this in my recent
beauty haul I picked up three foot soap
&amp;amp; Glory things and it is one of them and
I'm loving this so far smells incredible
it really really is moisturizing and
especially for the summertime is pretty
cooling as well so when I just got out
of the boiling hot bath this is
incredible
I also then like to use the soap &amp;amp; Glory
heal genius foot cream which again I
showed in my previous haul because I'm
having a bit of a dry heel problem so I
just like to put this all over my feet
and then put some socks on to lock in
the moisturizer I will then go ahead and
moisturize my face with Deena's L skin
Repair moisturizer for normal and
combination skin because I definitely
have combination skin and I've recently
found that out that I have very dry
patches and very very oily patches then
if I wash my hair I will go in with the
organics nose in coconut milk anti
breakage serum and the coconut water
hydration oil this just makes my hair
feel so much better and because I've
recently got it cut it's a little bit
shorter doesn't look it but it is this
is really really handy to keep the dead
ends from growing back when I've done
all of that I will get again just check
my phone and then I'll head downstairs
and make myself a drink so I actually
went for some strawberry detox water
tonight because I love detox water it's
so so nice and yeah one thing that's
what I'm going to go for anyway if I
don't you see any over Lake
it was changed but I like to go for a
bit more of a refreshing drink
considering it's summertime
I will then also get a snack which is my
probably going to be some brownies
because I made some brownies and oh
they're incredible
I just really hit my elbow that actually
really hurt but I will then just so
struggle down in my bed and I will
choose a movie or a TV series to watch
I'm most poverty which is watch over
Pretty Little Liars because I is like
three more episodes until we find out
who a is and I'd like to be prepared I
like to re-watch all of them and get my
a theories I personally think that it is
brain Kingstown I don't know why I do
have my theories and why I think it's
him but if you do want to see that video
if you do want me to do a video on my
leg pretty little live series let me
know the coins because I definitely do
that but yeah I will just sit and watch
Pretty Little Liars and just sit and
have a bit of a chill and a rewind
before I will head off to bed I will
also probably FaceTime a best friend
amber as well because we love to
FaceTime and plan what were you going to
buy on shopping trips and just plan
different things to do over in the
summer so that is basically my pamper
routine I really hope you enjoyed this
video
I love having pamper routines on kind of
an everyday basis not definitely not
school nights but now it's the summer
holidays I will be having so many pamper
routines I really hope you enjoyed the
video let's get this to 3741 thumbs up
