I am going to be doing a summer
sleepover ideas video so in this video I
am going to be showing you some
different DIYs some different things you
can do with your friends and basically
just a how to have an amazing summer
sleepover so I really hope you enjoyed
this video and let's get started
the first step to an amazing sleepover
is having a DIY fort so for this DIY
literally it's kind of hit and miss just
grab some blankets hang them from the
trees and just chuck a load of pillows
in there and create a random den that
looks incredible and is perfect for
Instagram pictures before you start to
have all of your sleepover fun you need
to have some drinks prepared so for the
drinks I'm a familiar number I literally
it just cut up some strawberries and I
poured water in it to make fruit infused
water you can do this with any fruit you
on me and amber just the first
strawberries but you could do it with
like grapes berries anything like that
and me and amber just drank this before
we got on with all of the rest of
activities we did and honestly it was
amazing
okay so a sleepover is definitely not a
sleepover without jamming out to your
favorite music
Samiha but actually had matching friends
headphones so you both put them on
jammed out to some music and we've had a
bit of a dance party and I'm not gonna
lie it's probably one of the funnest
things I've ever done in ages it's
amazing and you need to do this with
your friends
another thing you should totally do is
play youtuber whispers and yeah
me and amber really got into this tuckus
but laughs and Niomi smart are having a
baby
Marcus Butler and Naomi and Naomi's mark
smart ah ah hey married having having a
baby
yes no agent Aleksandr come again just
here to say the whole thing really I
can't do it I'm doing it hey Anton
Aleksandr and Amanda Steele yeah Haden
like Tyler is a seal perform a jamup
agent Alexander Aiden Alexander and
Amanda Steele are getting together and
Amanda's either getting together yeah
Kyrie with him huh no I got it
no yeah it's a more ya know what after
playing youtuber whispers he was so
hungry so another DIY idea you could do
is a DIY sweet hamper so literally all I
did was get a wicker basket I already
had from my room I filled it with some
of our favorite foods mostly Amber's
favorite foods but still my favorite
foods and we both just and ate that and
it was so good just how does a little
cute hamper where you can just get food
out it was amazing
and of course another thing you can do
is have a mini photo shoot and take a
ton of selfies because let's be honest a
girly sleepover isn't a sleepover
without selfies so a bit of a strange
thing to do a summer sleepover but me
and amber thought it would be fun to do
a bit of fitness so we got into our
sports bras and our leggings and our
workout clothes and we just done some
like jumping jacks and like stretches
and everything like that and it was
actually pretty fun but when we'd had
enough of that we've got our music back
on and did it again and yes they are
sports bras and yeah once we've done
that we just got back in our den and
finally the last idea is just to chill
out and watch some movies because we
have a pretty long day and that's a
girlie sleepover thing to do that is the
end of my summer sleepover video I
really hope you enjoyed it it was so fun
to film this and I really hope that this
can give you some inspiration on what
you could do a summer Seifer with your
friends or even if you're just bored by
yourself and you want to do some stuff
in this video so I really hope you
enjoyed the video let me know if you did
by giving it a huge thumbs up and let's
try and / 3k lights because I know we
can do that I love you all so much I
have an amazing day and I will see you
in my next video bye
so the landslide</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
