and own a bit of a different setting I'm
in the car and I'm here with my mum well
I'm worse at laughing but basically
today we're going to be doing tasting
Starbucks's at secret menu so we've just
been to the drive-through Starbucks and
ordered six different drinks out off
their secret menu whether it's the
actual secret menu I don't know I just
found six different like recipes online
for different types of drinks and I went
to bought them I literally spent 25
pounds on Starbucks drinks but today we
are just going to be tasting them for
you so yeah other than that I really
hope you enjoy the video and let's get
started so the first one we are going to
be tasting is this and this is a what
it's meant to be a cake batter
Frappuccino but the actual thing that we
ordered was a vanilla Frappuccino with
almond syrup apparently this is going to
be tasting like cake batter but I'm not
too sure really it's not they say
apparently is this meant to taste like
cake batter
I actually really like Starbucks
frappuccinos so hopefully I will really
like this but that's not that bad that's
disgusting eat that bad
yeah don't smell it drink a lot I can
see that in my normal auto body I can
see the cake batter coming through a
little bit but that's disgusting
all you can taste is almond you're
drinking loads of it
do you like that's okay because I like
almond I see that okay I don't like
almond at all so I really don't like
that no that's nice do you like that I'm
not saying I could drink a whole one but
yet but then I like it mmm I like
Coleman's but it doesn't taste like cake
batter not Tong after we targeted the
internet it was meant to taste like cake
okay it's nothing like cake nothing like
cake batter but if you like almonds have
on them said the new Hobbit EMS the next
ring we're going to be trying is meant
to be a cotton candy Frappuccino now
this is actually a vanilla Frappuccino
with strawberry or raspberry syrup they
put strawberry I did ask for raspberry
though so I don't know if this is going
to taste as you like it but this is like
the pink drink I don't know how well
it's showing up but it's actually pink
so
we try this that tastes like cotton
candy is really nice mmm triangle that's
really nice that does taste like cotton
candy so y'all don't like that at all
but it does taste like cotton candy than
that very very sweet very is very sweet
yet not at all she'll I don't like that
but I can see you're like it tastes like
cotton candy I think you know you may
buy cotton candy so I honest cotton
candy like the things you get at the
fair yeah it's very salty very sweet mmm
we don't want a whole one I couldn't
drink a whole one because it's so sweet
but it's a nice drink but I just
couldn't drink on that one I just buy it
because it's pink and for like Instagram
photos but it isn't like it's nice but I
prefer the taste of the almond so I
prefer the taste of this one but that's
because I don't like almond flavored
stuff so this next one is a chocolate
cream Frappuccino that is literally what
it said on the secret menu and I just
asked for that and they gave me it so I
don't know whether this is part of the
normal menu or whatever but it was on
the secret menu website that I went on
so I guess we're just going to try this
I think I'll quite like this to be
honest I don't know if you will mom
because you're not big on like chocolate
doing yeah you're not big on chocolate
drinks but let's try it no it's really
nice but it's really chocolatey that
tastes like Nutella
oh that's it that's a Nutella one that's
in this hello one sorry this isn't a
telephone I thought it said chocolate
opportunity this isn't meant to be
tasting like the television so that's
like it takes out Nutella though doesn't
it do you not think I think that tastes
really like Nutella
no that's just I mean I love chocolate
but I think that's like mmm that's just
like a bar chocolate you've melted it
and you're sucking it first raw it's too
much Hugh chocolatey but that is
literally Nutella do you not think I
need a bit of the curry no you laughs it
bear the Queen mana try a bit of the
cream so far the almond one for the wing
so far I'm thinking this cotton candy
one for the
when claims and hi screams we've been
high school the drink not so yeah I'm
not really free to order some I love
Nutella that's why I'm actually really
sad about is because I tell us so no and
I think that even tasted like do you not
think I I think it tastes up the tail
like a cheaper version of Nutella
he probably order this drink I don't
know this isn't meant to be a Twix
Frappuccino now she's going to be gay
this is going to be good this is a
normal caramel Frappuccino with extra
hazelnut so gosh people led you here
about the Twix sing people have said it
I might wait on the secret menu is part
of the secret menu no I love the caramel
so whoa total Yankee Candle darlin oh
yeah who's that
in it she tastes like yank it out I like
the krandalls in it oh my god
but it does taste it hard that's a
literal Yankee Candle but I nearly swore
haha I feel like coming any Anki candle
like I can take on even have another bit
that that was like happiness I can have
a little triangle
gingerbreads kind of nice last I know I
don't like that Anna mmm that's not good
honestly that's not why I come drinking
black hole this is meant to be Twix but
it's a caramel Frappuccino with extra
hazelnut no that's you can't even taste
that hey sup yo man that's not good none
I've got the taste to fly it it's like
the light you're eating a bit of there
wow yeah if you want a night I got this
have you ever wondered what a Yankee
Candle tastes like just get one of them
so this one is meant to be a strawberry
cheesecake kind of drink but it's
basically when we ask for like extra
strawberry they're like we've only got
the strawberry syrup or something like
that so I don't really know what this is
going to tell you side but it's meant to
be strawberry cheesecake so hold that
one I get a straw at them I'm really
excited about this one but I think he
looks really liquidy and kind of weird
because I love cheesecake I do my
cheesecake but I don't know how much how
this can go on really all we taste so I
can doesn't taste it but like it smells
like strawberry
hmm good oh that stupid cheesecake is it
really nice that's really good
that's like proper senorbrian that yeah
that is not she's gonna have the whole
thing now that's really good isn't it
that's really nice that is a good secret
menu drink if you like strawberry
cheesecake or like you can actually
taste the strawberry in that witness you
could drink the whole thing I could
drink you if you if you ordered this
light when it's really hot yeah in the
summer you know it's really refreshing
it kind of tastes like what obviously
takes out strawberry cheesecake but also
taste the telephone the calippo little
balls are the ice lollies things but
that does taste a strawberry cheesecake
so I'm god that is so good I
would definitely recommend that yeah
that that is probably the best outside
okay last one this is meant to be a bit
sick this is the last one this is meant
to be like a cookie dough chocolate chip
got five drinks so this is the chocolate
chip Frappuccino with white mocker
whatever that means monkey for today
this smells nice though there's nails
really nice mmm oh that's nice and
that's got me in coffee in it you don't
normally drink coffee oh but that's nice
told you you might like coffee no I
don't like coffee but that's nice
cuz you're can taste a coffee at all
let's call it blended cookie bits at the
top that is so good this is also no I
think this is the Oreo one this is like
this is Oreo it tastes like not the OREA
with the white finish a story with a
chocolate filling certainly better than
the other chocolate ones and that what
I'm definitely better than the other
chocolate one still not a huge fan that
you line up I like that I couldn't ring
a whole thing but mmm which one of them
got blended or which one of them could
you drink the whole this one probably
you have to have one of them and drink
the whole Cup which one this one and
