for today's video I am going to be doing
a testing fake eBay makeup and I'm
excited I wanted to do this video for so
long as it was a massive trend a few
months ago and I never got on it never
jumped on it but now I'm jumping on it a
few months later because I thought it
would be a really good video as I know
so many people tend to go into eBay in
order to make up thinking that it's
genuine when in reality if it's less
than five pounds it's probably fake so
why order to serve the most popular
makeup products in the industry right
now and I've tested out the fake
versions of them and created this
complete look which I'm actually quite
feeling if you want to see me test out
all the products then keep on watching
other than that oh no if you enjoy and
let's get started before we start I just
want to quickly address the fact that
yes I do already have foundation on
because the foundation I ordered isn't
actually here yet I needed to film this
video today and I actually did order
these heart-shaped a foundation
obviously a fake version but it isn't
here so I've just put on a Maybelline
fit me foundation a very lightweight
light coverage foundation so you can
test all of the other products fairly as
I'm really annoyed they didn't come
thanks eBay so the first product I'm
going to be testing and well of doing on
my face is my brows and I'm so excited
for this because I'm really intrigued to
see what its gonna be like so this is
the anastasia beverly hills dipbrow
pomade and i've got mine in the shade
hope and this is the shade that I
actually do have obviously this is the
fake version this only cost me one
pounds fifty obviously it came from
China it took a while to arrive but only
costed one pound fifty so let's get into
this box and preach what this actually
want to come open it just ripped it
first impression on the packaging is
that it's actually like the same like it
feels the same it looks the same nothing
gonna look out of shape to me here the
bottom it's very similar as well and
then we've got the product inside which
again actually it was very very similar
let's see if it's exactly like the other
one apparently a lot of people say is
very similar I don't know about it first
verse
it's very very soft look my brush is
just gliding through like it doesn't
feel like it's got any pigment it feels
very wet so let's try it on my eyebrow
and see what it looks like
all right what's coming out super dark
and it feels very wet like it's just
gliding on my brow as you can see it is
really dark he's already giving it a bit
of shape I'm just gonna create the tail
of my brow and again it's doing it
really easy because of the consistency
of the product it's just gliding on now
I'm starting to notice a difference the
real product is very thick and it is
really pigmented but because this is so
wet it's actually like leaving this like
wet glossiness on my brows and as you
can see it's not making a misshapen
anymore because the more I brush it the
more it's becoming transparent a minute
carve it out with concealer in a minute
what I mean I'm gonna go away and do the
other brow but it's just yeah it's too
liquidy it feels like I'm brushing water
on my face that tail was created a lot
easier than the first one so maybe you
just kind of need to get hang of it a
bit if you like a liquidy brow products
though then go for it because it's
actually not that bad I'm gonna carve
them out with you can see that in a
minute the first of all weeds but the
concealer on my face honestly as a first
impression I don't actually think it's
that bad I actually think it's quite
good
obviously chemicals and the things that
we used to make this are not good for
your skin and that's why you shouldn't
use them but as a first impression guys
are doing this with one pound fifty
could you the next product I'm so
excited to test out and this is the it's
heart shape tape concealer I'm so
annoyed the foundation didn't arrive in
time but at least the Cocina arrived so
this is the box and it come in I don't
really know if this is the exact same
box because my wanting to come in a box
but this is a box as it's come in it
just says Tarte shape tape contour
concealer and I've got mine in the shade
light and I think I paid 399 for this
which is obviously a massive at price
tag different compared to the other one
so oh I know what oh my gosh she
actually does it very very similar this
is a really good joob again it says
light on the bottom the packaging
doesn't feel cheap at all it's a shape
taped are the writings a bit wonky it's
not that straight that's just what I've
picked up on but the lid is very very
similar I mean it's in pretty good
condition
and then the product inside I mean yeah
he smells kind of funny yes well not too
good but let's try out the product I
let's see what it's like I am gonna use
this to carve out my brows as well what
we're gonna pop this all over my face
mine is in the shade light but it
actually doesn't look as light as it
should because my when it's in the shade
like that I actually have it the real
one it's a lot lot lighter than this so
shave different it's a little bit off
I'm not gonna lie to you my face feels
like it's stinging a little bit now I
don't know if that has anything to do
with the product or if it does feel like
it's stinging but on a first impression
I know it's kind of I mean it's actually
highlighting like it actually is
highlighting my foundation it kind of
going a bit grey coverage wise it's
actually gave me coverage I can actually
has given me some coverage it don't
smell too good and it feels like it's
oxidizing very quickly which the normal
Krissi that doesn't or at least it
doesn't on me and then just gonna take
my little brush and I'm just gonna carve
out my brows using this I'm just gonna
make sure that's all blended in and it
is still looking very reflective on my
skin but honestly considering this is a
tube I know you're not going to use it
because of the chemicals in it but it
actually feels like it has given me some
coverage which is kind of weird I think
I actually did put a bit too much on I
probably shouldn't have put this much on
and then it wouldn't look as great but
I'm gonna quickly set it with some
powder and then I can come back and we
can contour it up and see what that
looks like my honest opinion after I've
powdered it down is actually quite good
like honestly I would probably look at
this on somebody and I would never guess
that they've used a fake jus it actually
has gave me coverage it's not creasing
on my eyes which normal concealer does
we are now going to be testing on which
I'm really excited for this is the Kat
Von D shade + light contour palette and
mine is in Italy lightest shade I've
always wanted to try a dupe of this
because I don't actually have to pad it
myself but I've used it before and it's
really really good so I thought you know
what let's get a Jew packaging feels
quite nice it's quite smooth look was
identical to me inside quite mucky okay
it doesn't look at the cleanest but
we've got the three different shades
breathing for change on top here the
mirror is really dirty and it feels very
cheap right you know when it just feels
like it's a stick up but we're looking
at the makeup and I'm gonna just try the
contour shades out I mean I don't know
what they're gonna look like I've got a
morphe brush here and we're just gonna
pop it in these two shades first while
there's a lot of fallout company first
impression not really much color we're
gonna go in with the darker shade
because that didn't really give me
anything oh but the darker shade Debbie
goes darker shade is definitely more
pigmented which I obviously didn't
expect the lighter shade don't really
have much going for them that's blended
with really really nicely
it's very powdery and there's a lot of
loose pigment that's kind of dropped
onto my face so I don't know if I use it
again because of what it's made of
considering this is a fake it's actually
pigment it because you think it wouldn't
be when you look closer into the skin it
does look very gray toned which the
actual contour wouldn't but maybe that's
just cuz I've used a dark shade I'm
going to use some of the powders now
just to pop under my eyes and these look
quite pigmented as well this is like a
banana powder the yellow powder looks
really highlighting actually I actually
think that's really good it's obviously
not as pigmented as an actual palette
but you can tell the difference style
where contoured and round on where I'm
like highlighted I'm gonna use the ready
pinky shade as a blush because don't
actually have a blush with me and woah
that is very red like that's probably
too red but you know we're not gonna go
for being pigmented because thatÃ­s what
we won't be love the pigmentation honest
review I actually think it's good I
don't know if I should be thinking it's
good because they are dupes but it's
actually a really good remake the
packaging is awful and I had to approach
insiders okay now we're going to be
doing some eye shadow which I'm so
excited for and I'm going to be using
something I've always wanted to get so I
just thought you know what
we'll get the Jeep first let's see what
the dupes like so I've got the huda
beauty is smokey obsessions palette and
I was gonna like buy one of the big ones
at the rose gold palette but these are
very new out but I really wanted to try
one of these so this is the smokey
obsessions one and it's so pretty
you've got some goals in here you don't
really have any Browns like these are
all one in a top tip these are all kind
of Blacky gray shades so not gonna lie
I'm not
I'm gonna do this as its format five
shimmery and all the backs basically
black so we definitely go for a smokey
eye the eye shows us super super chalky
like they're very pigmented like this
one I picked up is very pigmented but
it's so chalky formula yes shades
no is anybody else get in the vibes that
I'm kind of rocking the like punch in
the face look like I've just been out on
the streets got knocked out five times
and then come to go on a night out I
feel like that still looks like this
palette is gonna give me but you know
I'll try slam it up the triangle am the
punch die up now I'm gonna go in with
the black shade and I'm gonna pop this
in the outer corner and that's really
pigmented so definitely put too much on
goodness of myself or understand you
know thought what we're doing definitely
you're gonna have to cut this at the
edge so please you can all how bad that
looks and as well these colors are
blending really really nicely so I don't
know why I'm complaining you're like I
said it's not the formula it's just the
shades of the colors I've picked they're
just not great I'm not gonna lie it
actually doesn't look as bad now I've
blend it like I'm actually quite feeling
it the glitters aren't as like glittery
as I thought but we're just gonna take a
mixture of them both and they're gonna
try and create kind of a half cut crease
it's gonna bring it up from the middle
and I'm just gonna drag it all from the
inner corner upwards yeah cut crease is
definitely a no but they glitter chains
are quite pigmented so maybe if we keep
packing them on then we might be able to
get some of the color coming through
again if I just brush away all of the
fallout underneath and actually I mean I
don't know what it looks like on camera
but I'm kind of feeling it like what
I've got lashes on it actually might not
look that bad
we're gonna go in with my trusty it's
heart shape tape conceal that we used
earlier am I gonna cut this just so it's
really really sharp and it did straight
as the smokey look is not for me today
I just put waiting but you can see them
on but you know what there's no going
back now oh but too much can see you're
on why do I do this just mess up the
whole look with the concealer under
stage and why don't me my eyes honestly
just look like a galaxy well then lick
you doesn't look like the sky and curl
it before it and I'm gonna lie I'm gonna
go away I'm gonna put some lashes on see
what I can do to save it I've got the
taxi lashes these are fake these are
real
do you think you're getting fake
eyelashes to be honest lashes are on I
don't know whether I've saved it or not
I've tried to save it the best I can I
put some more glitter on top I don't put
some on my under eye as well but you
know what considering its fake makeup
it's actually not that bad of an eye
look now we're gonna go in it for my
favorite part are we gonna go in it with
the Anastasia Beverly Hills Sun dipped a
glow kit but obviously it's fake this
was a $2.99
so it's very very cheap and you get four
shades well in it the packaging on the
front is literally the exact same like
actually if anything is more shiny and
then when you open it inside Oh No
so three we're actually no less a
three-hour four of my shades but all
four of my shades are actually smashed
so that's a really good start so we've
got the shade bronze
summer moonstone and taller line bronze
is like God shimmer and moonstone the to
change that I'm going to use so if I
take this off really carefully only
they're really really chalky at the
moment still really not much
I've been layering it up we're getting a
little bit more honestly this is a thing
that's also going to be the best but
it's not blinding as I've thought but it
actually and you know what that actually
is giving me some color just gonna pop a
bit more on I do need a bit more and I'm
also gonna try and put some on my eye as
well I think that might actually help
save it the highlighters are really thin
pans and you don't get much of in them
at all because I've just dug my brush in
and they're like bouncy
you know the journey consistency of the
NYX machi palettes it feels like that
it's gonna pop it in the inner corner
just to add another shade just so it
does kind of like contrast a little bit
I'm staying in the no but it's actually
not about it's actually a really pretty
color but obviously the formula of what
is made out of isn't great but the
pigmentation once you build them up it's
okay the Anastasia Beverly Hills lines
aren't exactly the most pigmented
highlighters anyway so actually I'd say
this is exactly the same pigmentation as
the actual real palette finally we need
to go in with lips and I'm so excited
for this as well I've got the Geoffrey
start of the liquid lipstick and mine is
in the shade
posh spice so I have no idea if this is
gonna go with the eye look as I just
ordered it but oh okay it's kind of
purply color packaging doesn't really
feel any different to any of the others
again it's just kind of a plastic one
got the
Inc stars here I feel like yeah you
could scratch it off really really
easily to share let's get a good amount
of lipstick on there and let's dump it
on it to my lips first impression it's
quite
but I really like the actual color of it
it's quite share which is what I
expected because obviously is fake
 who to layers I reckon this could
actually be quite good this is the
finished makeup look it doesn't look
like spring after all it literally looks
like winter but then you know what it's
raining outside today so this is the
look of going for on an overall level I
actually don't think it's bad
considering all of this makeup was cheap
alternative dupes I'm saying Jukes I'm
not really even dupes I let you just a
product with cheaper and I honestly
don't think it's even that bad the
lipstick is gradually becoming more
purple as it dries I don't know if I'm
feeling that because I wanted it to stay
dark but okay we've come into like a
bright purple but the eyes and the
higher and the face it's actually all
all that bad so overall I've seen this
makeup that cost me like what less than
20 pounds and I know the chemicals that
are used to make new products are not
good and that's why they're so cheap but
you know it's actually an OK face so
that is the end of this video I really
hope you guys have enjoyed seeing me
test out fake eBay makeup maybe it can
make you a little bit more aware of the
fact the makeup on eBay for that price
it's fake they're just really cheap
alternative dupes that people have made
and the products in them are not good at
all and I'm going to literally wipe this
off my face as soon as I finished
filming this video however I do actually
quite like the finished look and even
though it's very smokey eyes I think I
don't usually do I do actually quite
like it so thank you so much for
watching I really hope you guys have
enjoyed it smash a huge thumbs up if you
did let's see if we can smash 10,000
likes on this video and other than that
I will see you on a Sunday at 10 a.m.
