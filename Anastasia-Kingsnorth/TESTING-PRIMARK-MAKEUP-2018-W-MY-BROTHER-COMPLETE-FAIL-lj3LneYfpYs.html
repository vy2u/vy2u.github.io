because it is my little brother and say
he wanted to come and join me in my
video didn't you yes it's a day we test
it out fry my make up and as you can
tell by my face it wasn't the best I've
ever tried we have done this before and
Atticus did my complete face didn't you
yeah but you enjoyed I said it nights
heed do it nice and it done different
elements of my face okay if I don't need
dog like new digit don't be like that
why I dub it different it can be perfect
oh it can be perfect I hope you guys
enjoyed this video if you do remember to
smash a huge thumbs up and other than
that I hope you're doing and let's get
started boom that's you know what though
I am about to start testing out on my
makeup before you guys and I am joined
here as I've already said by a little
special guest want to say hi Atticus is
here he wanted to come and help me from
this video for you guys
a sample of could I can't he look he'll
say yeah it's gonna help didn't you that
is better show you do some makeup yes
yes I'm gonna start off with ups my
perfect color long wear ultimate matte
foundation and it was 5 pounds it comes
in a kind of glass ceramic type bottle
and it says it's the long way ultimate
matte foundation it has double coverage
and matte finish and is apparently
oil-free so let's find out if this is
actually true like I said it was 5
pounds oh no this is the one thing I
hate about things like this
you have to pour the product onto your
hand hate doing this
I know art occurs it's such a shame
isn't it I did again no back is kuba
that is a lot isn't it yeah first thing
I'm gonna say is this is a really sticky
consistency like it's almost kind of
like latex
and away like hits can you guys see this
it's quite like your weird sticky
consistency I'm not really liking it and
I also got the shade nude beige I didn't
want to get the lightest because I do
have a town on the rest my body sorry
out Paris a foundation brush and I do
have a Beauty Blender as well can you
open the packet for me you picked up DPS
blendable sponges I'm just gonna start
by wall so I'm going to spin out of
there
packing this on my face it's just really
really thick no I'm not a big fan of
thick products that it used to be honest
because they're really hard to blend
just ask mummy for our help
I literally just coughed so bad
basically sorry anyone you want bubs I
have been really ill I had the Aussie
flu or like thank you everybody powered
and I've been so nail I look a bit you
know that's why okay thanks dr. Cutler
show give up with this brush because
it's not the brush or the foundation
isn't really going anywhere actually
guys can see like it's not a bad
foundation at all like it's actually not
a bad foundation and luckily I do get
wise my little brother a pro makeup what
you're thinking about the colour Atticus
does it match yeah look kinda turns at
the other side so these are the prime
RPS at Beauty I do need you watching
this is very hard very hard
I do like punching myself in the face I
did use one or you together
it's literally like punching myself in
the face thank you so next we're gonna
go in it with the concern oh my gosh are
you joking
how am I meant to conceal anything with
this I can see the sadness coming
what a circus is definitely no good is
what much do I love you but that's not
good
no I love you oh we can get he said I
love you Primark what I do love you too
actually but it's fully stuck James you
like that I know you're not meant to
pups but its beauty videos always get so
messy and oh this is concealer this
isn't lipstick Atticus as you can see
guys I bought this in a little bit of a
lighter shade because I saw the
foundation was gonna be darker than it
actually is
are you gonna blend it for me oh go on
then you blend it for me save me some
work look money let me come here you I'm
gonna blend it in my chin
you keep rendered it in the forehead to
be honest even though we have an issue
with obviously getting the concealer out
I actually kind of in a weird way like
this can see you love alright I'm not
sure about the consistency of it but the
color like I feel like that has
imagining highlighted the areas where
I'm you know then again it's gone very
paltry
around my nose it's just an area where
everything does normally go patchy so
the base could have been worse but I
feel like even though the concealer was
only 90 P actually not that bad but like
I said my nose go I'm gonna be trying a
product that amber actually said it
meant to be really good so this is he
okay this is named PS insta go a banana
powder and it's an elusive powder to set
the makeup I'm going to bake this on it
to my face although this doesn't want to
come off so annoying
yeah baby both die good is it enough
I guess I can tell more of this power
than actually any good work is kind of
like a sheet set you know we're gonna go
in I'm making a bronze I mean I know
that I ain't gonna wallow in my skin I'm
telling you guys I just keeps telling me
to keep my hair on I go to Vegas I don't
know why all right I'm going to go in
with powder and I don't think this is
gonna be that good but let's give it a
go it's just really really shimmery and
Atticus is doing something - well why do
I kind of like it might be the writing
it might be the mirror and it's actually
not the worst bronzer I've ever tried
like it's actually kinda game I actually
kind of like the color of this like I
can't tell if it's like too dark you
know what I mean like a carburetor is
too hard yeah yeah
because it's neither banana powder but
but actually kind of like it and I feel
like it sounded kind of like a nice burn
in my face the only thing is it's got a
bit of shimmer to it and I'm not a fan
of shimmer I just prefer matte now I'm
gonna brush the banana powder off
although it seems to set into my skin
which I thought was gonna happen I feel
like that would actually be a really
good powder if it wasn't so yellow and I
don't know it's banana powder
maybe if I had a different maid I don't
know can you get shades maybe that's
what it is that I feel about my face it
just made you baba kind of Leonard okay
next I'm gonna go in with the PS and
this is like high pigmented based on
upper life I put it on much it oh gosh
yes
so my cheeks cheeks cheeks and then
don't shake kind of a cheek be careful I
was going a high pigment by article if
it was oh gosh no no nothing we've got
enough we all go hit it oh is if you
just start saying that's okay so my
makeup looks okay but no offense but I'm
gonna go in with the iconic brow Palma
so I'm gonna fill in and my brows and
then I'm gonna highlight and then we're
gonna go in with some eyelashes here is
the pomade it kind of just looks like
any pomade pop really and it's quite a
dark brown so I'm gonna do my eyebrows
and I'm gonna get back to you as you can
see I have now have got a some sort of
eyebrows and eyelashes on and these are
lashes will not stick on me for the life
of me I don't know what to do they won't
stick on they look awful and they feel
so plasticky we're just gonna have to
try and salvage the look that we have
because it's honestly it's so so bad and
I'm just gonna have to basically
highlight the hell out of my face
because I don't know what we're gonna do
else because this looked it just just
didn't go how I want it to go so like
for my makeup could actually be like
half decent like if it was used
to its full potential but for me
personally today no it's a no for me
this whole lot I might be quite good
though to be fair if the blush was in
the right place
courtesy of Atticus wouldn't look too
bad but yeah not quite feeling it so
let's get the highlighter open this was
three pounds and it's like a shimmer
break so that's just basically shim up
the hell out of this break this is
actually a really nice highlighter but
it's a really really gold tone as you
can see like I feel like this is
somebody with a much darker skin show
shown say mutter tone than me because I
love highlighters but I'm like this is
so so pigmented but it's really gold and
I normally go for like really really
white toned highlighters spy is very
very pretty so like this is just like an
attempt to who's gonna stop so this was
just an attempt at like an Instagram a
slay look that just didn't work do you
know what I mean now finally we're gonna
go in with some lips so this is a copy
of your courage and that lip care and it
is the get lippy matte collection that
is a lip liner but on the bottom lip
liner so we're just gonna go straight in
with the lipstick and this like I said
is any new shade so this is actually a
really similar plane to catch okay look
it actually is I mean it definitely not
the shade in the tube but it just kind
of look like Kylie Jenner does I love
makeup oh do you okay no dude I can look
at least one person likes it hey is the
finished makeup look obviously this is
not a serious look at all the eyelashes
a button meets so much but Prime at
makeup is actually good it just doesn't
really suit my face on my skintone and I
just bought the wrong shades didn't I
Africa yes I'm gonna end it over here I
really hope you guys enjoyed and I will
see you I've said they attend e-m-f a
brand new one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
