back with my testing prymaat beauty
video so I will be testing out a bunch
of Primark makeup which I'm really
excited for actually this is a finished
look I mean I'm not in love with it
but I like it it's an okay look I
managed to create this for less than 10
pounds so I would definitely carry on
watching because it's really really good
if you're looking to start any makeup
and also comment down below some other
product make up bit that I haven't tried
out in this video that are really good
I've heard that the tweezers and the
eyelash curlers are really good I don't
have them but I would love together but
yeah I hope you enjoy and let's just get
started so I'm going to start off with
the PS liquid foundation it says it has
an all free formula enriched with
vitamin E it is the same at medium
coverage foundation suitable for all
skin types I got mine in the shade
porcelain and it was two pounds fifty
now I'm normally used to a medium
coverage and I've heard very mixed
opinions on this but I guess it just
depends to what you're normally used to
to how you think it is if that makes any
sense so I'm quite used to a medium
coverage but I'm going to go for like a
full coverage I'm going to put a lot on
just to see how it looks but I forgot to
buy brushes I've got only bought one
brush because they didn't have any of
the others so I'm yeah I'm going to have
to use my normal Beauty Blender which
could make a difference I don't know but
yeah I'm just going to dab this all over
my face I'm not really doing this in any
particular order so if I look over there
it's because I'm looking in the mirror
but yeah I'm just going to dab this all
over my face I mean I don't exactly have
high hopes for this because it was a
very cheap foundation but I'll give you
guys a close-up and everything it smells
quite nice I mean it doesn't smell that
bad I quite like the smell actually I'm
not really sure what it reminds me of
but I kind of like it so I'm just going
to use this little mirror here which is
my Primark powder and I'm just going to
blend all of this in this could be a
little bit too light for me because I
did buy porcelain
use me in that light so yeah only thing
I would say with this part makeup is a
lot of it was open which were really
annoying and that's why I had to get
porcelain and not the shade up because
it straight up everything was open and I
don't want to put something on my face
people Maps watched this one was the
only one done up instead of tape so
that's why I got this one I mean the
coverage isn't bad it's not amazing and
it's quite cakey on my skin but I would
say this is an okay foundation for like
a beginners foundation like Gaston is
only 250 as its ending up high hopes but
it just kind of looks streaky and is not
really giving me as much coverage as I
would have liked yeah so there's my
foundation as you say I look really
white especially can't I've had a pen in
person but on the camera I look like a
ghost
so I mean this isn't my favorite
foundation in the world as I said it is
quite streaky but the coverage isn't
overly bad I mean I don't know I guess
it's just cause my skin's come spotty
anyway but yeah the coverage isn't
amazing but I wouldn't say it's terrible
either I do kind of like it but I think
I got the wrong shade so mixed opinions
on that I'm now going to do the eye
shadow so then I can like cut it off
with concealer so I just got this ps9
shade eyeshadow palette it was actually
open so I had to buy one that was a
little bit broken which is annoying but
this is only two pounds fifty and I
really like this it has some really
pretty shades if they work so as I said
I bought one eyeshadow brush which is
this one here I don't have the packaging
anymore but it's just the PS blending
brush and I'm also going to use some
Mario Techniques brushes because I feel
like the bristles on the prior art
brushes aren't amazing like I just
thought they're not going to pick up a
lot of product so I am just going to use
my Real Techniques one so I'm just going
to use some of the matte Brown shades
here and I'm just going to blend this
through my crease I can tell ya there's
going to be a lot of drop out so I
probably should have done this first
like this Archer is actually falling
everywhere but the pigmentation is
actually okay like I don't know if you
guys can see that but it is P
so I feel like we can work with it go
quite messy like this is how I do my
eyeshadow I drag it out really far and
then I cut it off with concealer to make
it like a sharp line
that's just how I've got to do my
eyeshadow now but to be honest guys I'm
actually liking this like it's really
pigmented it doesn't have as much
fallout as I thought it would like it
looks like it would have more in the pan
and it actually does and actually dig in
this color I quite like the kind of
Matt's looking the crease and then
glitter on the lid that's the kind of
look I've been going for a lot recently
and I really like it like I'm digging
this color a lot then I'm going to go in
with the middle shade here which is just
a really nice little glitter shade I'm
just going to pop this all over the lid
to give the lighter shades a pop then
I'm just going to swap my brush and I'm
going to take the bottom shade in the
middle in the bottom row I'm just going
to pop all of that my lid these glitter
ones aren't really pigmented I want to
have a really white lid so they were
really popped against the inner crease
the inner crease the crease but we
haven't really been able to do that
because the I suppose the light ones
aren't as pigmented dark went earlier
but the light ones just aren't yeah
that's the eyeshadow I currently do much
with it is a decent palette the dark
codes are very pigmented I'm then going
to go with this concealer and it is the
PS concealer in the shade the light I
think it was it was 90 P so again don't
have high hopes for this but we never
know I'm just going to put bunch under
my eyes this is a stick concealer and I
never used it concealers so it's very
thick but we'll go with it
thick concealers can sometimes even
really good coverage so I'm just going
to like put this everywhere but again
I'm just going to blend it with my
Beauty Blender as this is so thick it's
so hard to blend but the coverage it's
okay it's a very highlighting concealer
due to the shade that I got it in it's
ok coverage but because they should have
got it in again it's very highlighting
it's going to blend on my chin
other cities are a really thick I know
this isn't the best I'm actually quite
pleased with it so now I'm going to go
in with the PS a face powder in the
shade light and this is just a setting
powder I wasn't going to bother with
powder but I didn't know how matte the
thing would be could this is very like
loose there's a lot of product coming on
but it's really mattifying which is what
I need I definitely feel like it's
locking everything into place which is
always good because that is what a
powder is meant to do that's not a bad
powder that's okay it's very light as I
said I need to stop buying too light
shade but that's an okay foundation I
mean powder I'm then going to go in with
the PS strobe shimmer block this was 2
pounds 50 I like the packaging on this
because it's copper which is actually
what drew me to it and yeah it's just
really really nice so I'm just going to
take the pinky shades and blend these
I'm gonna use it as a blush it doesn't
look very pigmented to me I mean it's
okay it's not amazing but it's a nice
little natural look with you pal 50 I'm
actually quite happy with that now I'm
looking into mirror that's actually
quite nice and then just going to take
the really whitey shade at the top and
just highlight a little bit okay now I'm
going to go in with mascara this is the
volumizing mascara and this is a pound
I mean pound yeah we don't really know
so let's just give it a try this isn't
too bad
I feel like it's going to eventually go
very clumpy if I apply too many coats
but other than that it's not actually
that bad
I wouldn't use on an everyday basis like
but it's a really good natural-looking
mascara if you're looking for a very
natural look but I'm just not a fan of
these brushes I just really don't like
them and I just feel like they don't
apply my mascara how they could but it
does it okay so I'm not going to
complain it was a pound plus I can't
like the gold on the packaging so I'm
then going to try the PS velvet matte
lipstick crayon which I hear a lot
people talk about and that's why I got
this one and this is in the shade
something got those well maybe it's in
the shade uncovered I don't know but I
really like this shade and the it
could complement the eye shadow they go
light on your lips but I'm not sure how
am I can I smell that's a lip color I
mean I don't like it that much
purely for the fact that I've liked
quite nude shades and I thought this
would be a lot more nude but it's more
on the red side okay I mean this is the
finished makeup look I'm not digging it
I'm not loving it but it's okay for the
price I think I paid like ten pounds for
all this stuff do ya that is a moral
test in Primark beauty video overall I
would say is one of the bye if you are a
beginner in makeup I wouldn't buy it if
you have got a lot of makeup at the
moment because you'll just notice that
it's not amazing but if you're beginning
with it I would say it's really really
good but yeah I really hope you enjoy
today's video if you did give it a huge
thumbs up and let's see if we can smash
7,000 likes I don't know so much add I
will see you next week's video
