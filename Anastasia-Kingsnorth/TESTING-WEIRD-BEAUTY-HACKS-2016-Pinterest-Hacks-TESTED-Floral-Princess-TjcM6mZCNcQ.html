going to doing a testing weird beauty
hacks thought it would be really fun
today just to kind of do like a bit of a
random video where I just kind of test
hacks that I've seen floating around the
internet because there are some very
interesting beauty hacks out there
whether they work I don't know I think
half of them are condos I made up as a
joke but I just thought I would give
them a try you know because why I want
to lose other than make myself look like
an idiot on the internet I have an array
of things around me and I'm just going
to show you some really but good slash
weird hacks is they work great if they
don't I probably just wasted ten minutes
of my life but I whoa you guys get a
laugh out of it and it's funny for me to
watch back so yeah I'm just going to get
straight into it I really hope you enjoy
the video and let's get started so
beauty hack number one is apparently
take an old toothbrush and take some
hairspray spray the hairspray on the
toothbrush and then kind of like brush
back your flyways like I always say I
have like doggy ears like look at that
so let's just see like I mean I don't
know it might work so let's just get
some hairspray and spray it that's so
satisfying oh my gosh right I'm just
going to like rush back my flyaways I
mean I feel like it might be working
like it feels a little bit like greasy
or it feels like greasy in a way I don't
know I'm gonna try it without the big
bit let's spray like a load of hairspray
why everyone thinks of hairspray now oh
I'm completely mess a toothbrush and I
did definitely didn't go to swear then
stick in what's gonna see like Oh
my daughter years are gone how amazing
is that like let's do the other side
guys that hack is so good I am gonna be
using that all the time my hair looks
normal I know how longer have w's works
the next one is a little bit of a random
one not really sure if it's going to
work to be honest so you get your
mascara which I have here and you pop it
in your bra for two minutes to warm it
up and then apparently when you use it
it will be easier to use so I mean
iron-ons going to put it in my bra it's
going to like slot it Tellman middle
here that's why I wore this top like I
don't think you can see it but yeah it's
pop down the middle just going to a
system wait for that to do its magic and
then I put on my eyelashes so it's been
like roughly two minutes and I just
wiped off my eye makeup so it's still
there lovely it's going to like pull it
out I mean it is really warm so I mean
let's just try it I don't think it is
going to work and I don't have a mirror
so I'm gonna have to use my phone but I
feel like it could possibly work maybe
my gosh my eyelids are so clack I think
it's working you know let me hold it
here I feel like that gave my eyelashes
so much more volume maybe that's just me
for like what I'm seeing in the camera
but you guys see in this like I feel
like it gave me so much more volume like
heatset your mascara that worked I'm
shocked put your mascara in your bra for
two minutes
amazing so for the next hack I have some
liquid eyeliner and some eyelash curlers
and apparently if you put liquid
eyeliner on the eyelash curlers when you
co eyelashes it will work perfectly I
mean it is gonna work
probably not but let's try it anyway
you're probably meant to use pencil
liner with it but I unfortunately own no
pencil
because I never use eyeliner so if this
hat works never know maybe I'll wear on
animal but I don't see this working
eyelash curlers ready I know just tweeze
them so all that ions come off will burn
but you know you live in you learn and
I've got all of them on my bed you
definitely do live in LAN right let's
try it now I mean I don't this is going
to work being honest
Oh God Oh that did not work after all
I mean can you even see that that it'd
not work I was so excited thought that
was gonna work that's so annoying right
well that one's just gone down the drain
I didn't work right this next one is a
little bit random and I don't really
know how this is going to work either
but you get a spoon you get a brush to
contour with and then you put your spoon
on your cheat maybe like this or like
this and you contour around it I mean
why not to lose or anywhere myself I'm
such an idiot
anyway so get my contour bronzer I'm
nobody sure what way you're meant to put
the spoon I didn't really do any
research into this then you wipe myself
out what do you do just like contour and
I mean I don't think I'm doing this
right at all all right I don't think I'm
doing this right did that work for
looking my top yeah my quarry see it
that much but that's alright that was
how my mum's all right it doesn't look
great and they don't think I did it
right so please don't take me seriously
on that one but I feel like you possibly
could get that to work maybe I don't
know didn't really work very well to me
cuz I'm not very skilled in year-old
culture and bronzing area but you know
this next hack is probably the most
stupid I've ever heard but I thought it
would be hilarious to try out so it's
basically you take black eyeshadow yes
black eyeshadow and you put it in your
nostrils to make them look bigger I mean
I personally don't want bigger nostrils
why but let's try it anyway because you
know so I've got my black eyeshadow
let's get my mirror
let's turn myself into a pig oh my god
oh my god what is happening right now
this is not the way you went to do that
I do not look right I do it to my other
nostril I would never go out like this I
mean yes it makes them look so much
bigger because this but if I know it's
super thin but I feel like I look like
such an idiot
oh no no shoulders leave it on low for a
joke I'm saving like the messy ones to
last so red lipstick put it under your
eyes and apparently it will highlight
brighten them I don't know but let's try
it because well I already gave myself
nostrils so let's try this so red
lipstick this one's by Kiko if you're
wondering red lipstick series he washes
me out which is why I don't wear it a
lot I always there like burial nudes
that's beside the point that put this on
anyway I own I think it's just going to
work this is more like how to become a
clown I'm just gonna try it on both
because I might as well you're meant to
actually use like orange lipstick but I
don't own honest lipstick oh my god look
at myself I don't want to like ruin any
of my brushes this is a thing because
obviously I like state right now so I'm
just going to use
little brush and what do i do just blend
it into my skin okay let's just blend
guys is not going to work I don't think
I'm doing this right like do it don't
judge me look come on this is not like
you meant to like put this under
foundation like is that what I'm doing
wrong because I feel like that is what
I'm doing wrong I feel like you're meant
to put this on under foundation I'm
going to read this hack properly really
quickly because why have I just done to
my face
put like amazing a fit on the top but
guys seriously like on a serious note do
you really think this is not going to
show underneath my foundation like what
have I even done to my face I mean I
don't know why I've done like each to
their own it might work for you
sadly color correcting with red lipstick
and does not work for me so I'm going to
try this one last hack and I'm basically
going to put red lipstick on my lips and
apparently try and remove it with olive
oil I think this is going to turn out
gross as well but let's try anyway I
have not done this right but here's my
face
let's get them a pure sunflower oil
spray and try and remove it from my face
just going to like put some tissue like
get some tissue and put it on here
because I don't really want to like run
my finger in it so let's just spray some
this is disgusting I can't believe I'm
doing this
okay I don't read it this is gonna work
Oh
is this working I can't see
guys I think this has actually worked
I mean it's not bad I am conceive it at
that me looking like a state but you
know I'd do it for you guys I thought
this would be hilarious
let me know if you enjoy this by giving
this a huge thumbs up and let me know if
you want me to do more hack videos
because like testing out more hacks
because look at my face and I like to
make an idiot of myself on the internet
I think it's funny but yeah I love you
all so much give it a big thumbs up if
you enjoyed let's smash 10,000 lines for
doing this to my face if you all so much
I don't see in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
