and buy the food I was my moment with
Atticus and we're gonna pick two liter
up when we get there now mommy's gonna
have to ask for an excessive amount of
food at the drive-through which is gonna
be a little bit embarrassing because I
don't know what their reactions gonna be
but he's gonna have to tell them always
before we start though I do just want to
quickly clear something up obviously we
have bought a lot of food we're gonna
buy a lot of food and we're gonna eat as
much as we can forever we don't eat
we're not gonna be and we are gonna give
out to people we're gonna see if we can
give it to like a homeless shelter or
something we're going to try to find
something maybe you can give the food so
we're gonna make sure that none of the
food goes to waste so I just want to
clear that one out before we start but
we're approaching but I can see it so
let's get the food three signature
classic meals right three signature
classic meals three chicken nugget
medium meals three chicken nugget medium
meals now free chicken select meal space
and then 13:30 we just tell you if you
might think it's windup ponies no we're
filming a video
so we need low-to-mid on food so we have
30 boys medium fries please
yeah 30 please do you want some of it
saving Atticus we've just ordered the
food and it but basically we changed the
order because he planned out what we
were going to get first we changed all
the last-minute because he realized we
had way too many drinks and it's come
too late you just under a hundred pounds
so that's how much we wanted to test
anyway I'm busy
they looking like they're having a panic
in there when we asked for 30 need your
tips are like laughing yeah yeah we can
hear they were laughing they're just
getting our drinks ready now so god
knows how they're going to carry all
this but we're gonna give it a good shot
we're just wondering why they haven't
sent us to obey because the man behind
us looks very very ungrateful something
to hold me to hold on I do
guys look at all this food like we've
got all the drinks in here oh and
there's just chips everywhere in my
house my ass
we've just got home and here is all of
the food so now me and Tanisha have got
a job unboxing all of this before the
other two cards and laying out on this
table here is all the food laid how
we've laid it all out stacked it all up
it doesn't look like I don't know I
thought it was gonna look like more we
were originally gonna order 10 more
drinks instead of yeah I forgot that all
the meals came with drinks and chips so
this other food we've got and now we
just went for the boys so you can start
peeling it off I just want to reiterate
one last time that we have figured out
where the food that we don't eat is
going to go and because homeless
shelters around here do not take cooked
food we are going to give it to there's
a group of homeless people that hang out
in our town there's quite a few of them
and we're gonna give it to all of them
and we're gonna give it to parents we're
gonna eat most of it so I just want to
say one more time that the food is not
going to go to waste and it is all going
to be eaten I don't know it's an
excessive amount but I wanted to do it
as an experiment for you guys as most of
you said you're going to see it so I
just wanted to like put that one in
there hi everyone and welcome back to my
channel so for today's video as you can
so as you can see I'm not here by myself
today I'm here with my friend Tanisha
Doyle and Dev
and today we're basically gonna be
singing how much I can win from all of
this McDonald's basically will also be
eating the food and actually questions
for you guys and everybody requested
that we did this they're like please go
boil it in the Donald so that's what
I've done you both um I love McDonald's

huge thumbs up and let's get started

same school as your friend anymore make
your friendship complicated yes
no don't leave it boy I don't know I
feel like I'm closer to people now that
people on a school it's pretty weird cuz
I don't really talk to you guys that
much during school yes I was kind of
friends with y'all's president oil yeah
I just be to honor at all right the last
couple weeks of you know it's like yeah
we just like people we need from school
I mean doing more than white friends
away of it but was until like that I
don't know
yeah we've already got both peak on you
guys you missed on me for five years
that's your biggest regret
yeah you can get quite a lot politically
into things and they broke up no we're
both very ethical very mature mrs.
Diller very similar very similar the way
she was that's quite like intellectually
engaging what's the best moment you've
all shout together I want to say prom
than the after-party afterparty yeah
that was pretty just just but the whole
last week of school where are you stupid
theories every day like on that last
week we had exams yeah the whole time on
the field you just so much week I was
like incredibly somebody serious advice
surely a bit probably Doyle because he
taught me straight
Wow well ha oh no I actually depth
effect you just say well you do you all
give really good advice to be fair I fig
know sometimes like be a bit too nice to
just give me turn on whereas you two
were to tell me straight to the point
I think they always hope you more to the
point than I would to the point because
I feel bad for saying you but why the
please do this now what is fast yes yes
- do you suggest no well you know who's
most likely to die from something stupid
that when I was gonna say that way - so
you stupid would it be you'd die from a
video idea
try thinking yeah I think you don't put
your head in a microwave again slice it
what happened janeshia would actually
wear war if you have to only wear one
makeup product what would it be why is
that the new Primark stuff Oh s-sorry
how long does a video on it not
foundation I reckon it'll be something
to do with your eyes woman oh she wants
this password after you guys can see we
have finished peeling off all of the
stickers now we just got a bit carried
away doing a QA everybody's gone home
and I've sorted through all of the
stickers and I can conclude that we
literally didn't win barely anything
I've won so much free food and that's
literally it we managed to collect all
the ones you need for the brown
wind you more food but other than that
we didn't win anything but then to be
honest in basically every single one of
these videos I've seen nobody's actually
won anything bigger than food so I
wasn't really surprised but I still
wanted to give it a go myself
and we also have managed to clear every
single bit of food apart from there's
two burgers does there's a trap it in
the microwave so I can heat them up but
don't know whether you actually are
meant to heat them up I don't know if I
actually will but they're in there just
in case I'm gonna Google it fast but
thank you so much for watching I really
hope you guys have enjoyed if you did
smash a huge thumbs up let's see if we
could smash at twenty thousand lights

hundred pounds on McDonald's and I think
that deserves a like I love you all so
much
