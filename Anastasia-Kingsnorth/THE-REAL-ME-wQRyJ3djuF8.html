to do a bit of a different one I just
wanted to sit here and talk to you guys
about things that I never talk to you
about
I always make Beauty videos and fashion
videos and DIY videos and I love them
they are my favorite thing ever but this
week I just felt like sitting down and
talking I don't really do q and A's and
I don't really enjoy watching them that
much really that's why I don't do them
but I've wanted to talk to you guys for
a long time just to sit here and share
my opinions on different topics and
bring up things that have affected me in
the past however long I don't want
sympathy I don't want any of that I'm
doing this video purely for the fact
that I want you guys to know the real me
I want you to see the real Anastasia and
know that there is a real person behind
the camera I feel like it's really easy
to get caught up in youtubers life and
just to watch them on camera and
constantly think that they're happy all
the time and their life is amazing and
they have everything they could one and
there's nothing that could go wrong and
that couldn't be further from the truth
in reality youtubers life just aren't
like that
I'm not going to speak for everybody but
mine definitely isn't I feel like people
look at a youtuber like I said they just
look at them and think your life must be
perfect you have everything that you
want you have everything that you need
but it's not like that youtubers are
just as real as any videos and I feel
like that needs to just be said one more
time because so many people say it all
the time it just doesn't click youtubers
have feelings
she was have emotions and they get upset
and they get down because that's normal
we choose to share bits of our life on
YouTube and we get picked apart for them
one of the things I wanted to talk about
was hate because it's got more and more
recently and it's horrible I've never
really got much hate in the beginning
from viewers anyway I got it from people
at school and people teased me and even
people who I thought my friends would
tease me and talked about me behind my
back
but that's besides the point hay is such
a big topic and I feel like this
becoming this is a really fine line
between constructive criticism and hay
and I feel like people need to just find
that finer difference because on every
video I upload people pick me apart and
pick my appearance apart it's horrible
before I came onto YouTube I never I
never really had any major insecurity
about myself but since being on YouTube
even though it's the best thing ever
happened to me people just pick you
apart and they make you really
self-conscious this bits about myself
that I now hate because people just
bring them up all the time and people
just constantly say nasty things about
them it's like to the point where they
can be so self-conscious about them and
I just wish people wouldn't this stop
like people say like you put yourself on
YouTube and you have to expect hate and
I completely agree I know you do believe
me but
I just I just want to ask it does want
to say to people that there's a real
person behind the camera and hey can
hurt people it's not nice and I just
think people need to realize how they
would feel if it was said to them like I
said I have a lot more in securities now
about myself than I did before because
of how many people have picked them
apart and it's horrible another thing I
wanted to talk to you guys about was
just YouTube in general and people's
outlook on it I feel like especially
recently on Twitter there's this hashtag
you're probably familiar with it if you
have Twitter and it's called the YouTube
honesty hour and people sit there and
they say things about YouTube that they
wouldn't say any other time and it's
full and I mean full of negativity
slagging off youtubers slagging off what
people have said and i just don't
understand it as horrible as a hate can
be and as horrible as some people can be
YouTube should be a positive place
because it has become one of the biggest
platforms with the most amazing set of
people on it yet they're picked apart
and it's awful I would sit and read the
hashtag and people would be like
YouTube's not the same anymore
or everybody's changing the best YouTube
year was 2013 and 2014 people's
merchandise too high the prices are too
high it's too common to bring out books
now it's just becoming common I just
don't understand why we can't all be
positive and supportive towards each
other everybody started from the same
point on YouTube whether you're a viewer
or a creator and I wish everybody would
just support each other in this whole
situation I don't know why I'm going
with any of this and I'm just sitting
here talking because I feel like I just
need to talk to somebody
except I'm talking to a camera and I'm
going to talk to you guys
because you mean the absolute world to
me I can't comprehend how much you have
changed my life my life would never be
the same without YouTube and it is made
me the person I am today and even though
I'm sitting here getting upset because
things are just getting to me it's the
best thing that could ever happen to me
I had a really really tough upbringing
it was like it was amazing in ways and
then there's just things that Owen were
you shot anybody it's horrible I can't
think about it because I just don't
think about it anymore
and I think I came onto YouTube as an
escape and it's the best thing that
could have ever happened to me life can
sometimes get really hard and I know it
can for everybody and I'll never talk
about some of the things that affected
me like I've only told a few people they
know who they are because I trusted
though and it's just I've just made some
of the bestest friends through YouTube
and that helped me so much I had like I
have like my best friend amber how I
didn't meet on YouTube I met her she's
like one I met her through school she's
like my rock she just knows everything
and like she's just always there for me
and I cannot thank her enough for that
and then I have obviously my youtube
friends which I'm amazing because I
never thought I would meet so many
amazing people that I now couldn't live
without it's tough because there's some
stuff that I'll never tell people why
they need time
to me but they know who they are because
I've made it pretty clear to them but
there's just some people that are just
amazing
and you can't thank them enough for just
listening to you cuz sometimes you just
need to sit and tell people something
and they're there for you and that's the
best feeling ever and even though
sometimes I can get really moody and be
a little bitch they're still there is so
nice I guess I'm trying to say is a huge
Eve is amazing and even though I feel
crap today
and I feel like laughing right now
because my nose is stuffed up and I've
been crying and yeah I just I don't know
you she was amazing and I cannot thank
you all enough for everything and I'm
sorry this was just such a ramble I'm
sorry this was the most randomest video
you could ever expect it off me
but I'm sorry I just wanted to tell
somebody I hope you guys understand and
next week I'm going to be posting my
usual videos because I love posting and
they're my favorite things to post ever
and you guys are my family you have made
this a family and I love you all so much
if you ever want to talk to anybody if
there's something wrong you know I'm
here for you and if you just want to DM
me on Twitter or Instagram just message
me or leave a comment down below and I
will talk to you I love you guys so much
again I'm really sorry I just needed to
get some stuff out and stuff off my mind
and yeah I love you all so much and I'll
see you in eight weeks ago</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
