back and I am going to be doing a huge
Christmas themed River Island try
alcohol I get asked all the time to try
on whores so I've got a bunch of things
from River Island today and I'm going to
be doing a huge Christmas themed try on
haul and these are going to be ideas for
New Year's Eve New Year's Day Christmas
Eve at Christmas Day and Boxing Day
outfits
obviously it now Christmas is fast
approaching us is actually like it's
less than 8 weeks away which is crazy
because I do not know where this year
has gone I thought it'd be very
appropriate to start my Christmas themed
videos sorry it might be bit early for
some of you but I love Christmas so I
wanted to start them early I wasn't
really cool items to show you guys here
and I'm very excited to show you them at
so I think we should have get sat in the
hole
the majority of these items are from the
team range that are some items from the
other ranges but the rarity are from the
team range but all items will be linked
down below with the prices and
everything so if you guys do like
something in this video you can just go
into the description box and buy it
straight down there now I really hope
you enjoy and let's just get started I
feel like it's really appropriate just
to start with like a Christmas Eve and
like Christmas Day and I don't know
about anybody else but for those kind of
two days I just kind of wear like
pajamas and kind of like chill wow I
don't really like to get ready
necessarily because I don't really find
myself going out I just kind of watch
Christmas movies and watch quite a bit
on the TV and spend time with family and
everything so I just like to be really
comfortable so I picked up some pajamas
and I'm not even just saying this these
are some of the best pajamas I've ever
picked up there are this gorgeous like
satiny silk type material and I kind of
this like blush pinky color they are so
beautiful down the sleeves they've got
this lace detailing and like the sleeves
are like open and then obviously black
detailing here and then on the pocket
it's got an hour eye for River Island
and then it's all got the black
detailing and the buttons down the front
and it's basically just a really soft
smooth sleep shirt I thought this would
be really really nice for Christmas Day
and Christmas Eve and this was 20 pounds
of course I had to get
the matching bottoms so again bottoms
are exactly the same material they've
got a like tired drawstring here which
is very good quality and then you've got
pockets as well and identified you guys
I love pockets in my dramas I just find
it so handy to kind of like put your
hand in them just like when you're
walking ass up and to put your phone in
it's just so so handy and then again all
the way down to the bottom it's got the
black detailing but honestly I am so
excited to wear these they are so so
smooth and I honestly think I'm gonna
have the best night's sleep in these so
Christmas Eve and Christmas Day you're
getting worn now moving on to some more
like casual outfit so for Boxing Day I
kind of go very casual I tend to hit up
the Boxing Day sales does anybody else
do that I love going to like all the
shops and stuff and get any discounts so
that tells me what I don't box today so
basically this is kind of like a
shopping outfit of course I have to pick
up some of the in River Ireland jeans
their jeans are such good quality so I
have to pick up a pair I never wear blue
jeans I've always they're black jeans I
think you guys know that by now I'm a
sucker for black jeans so I picked up
some of these these are called the going
out Jean hi-rise jegging so these are
super super nice super comfy got the
river island badge at the back here and
then they're quite like these fake
pockets yeah they've got fake pockets
which I kind of like actually I don't
really like my jeans with pockets
apartment back do these have them I've
got back pockets and then again these
are just normal plain black jeans that I
could possibly roll up at the bottom I
think I will roll these up actually
these are lot they're gonna fit me
they're quite stretchy which is nice and
yeah I would just wear these kind of for
an everyday outfit really I tend to wear
jeans every day so can't go wrong with a
pair of black jeans I then picked up
this top which I absolutely love and it
basically just says Rue Saint Dominique
Paris it's like a Oh gray navy blue
color and it's so so nice and then the
detailing is in this kind of like a
reflective metallic silver just looks
super super comfy and this is 18 pounds
but I'm a sucker for kind of like not
necessarily a slogan but just like tops
that have the writing on that you can
kind of tie up wearing different styles
or take into
this is such a beautiful material as
well it's very stretchy even tell it's
going to be really comfy so this would
be really good for kind of like Boxing
Day shopping by then it picked up some
shoes and I don't really have many kind
of slip-on shoes I kind of own a lot of
trainers but never really slip-on so I
picked up these and these are just a
white curve like I said slip-on I'm
solely type shoes there like I said they
are plain white with this gold rim
detailing which I really like I didn't
think I never wear shoes like that but I
really do like it it's got a river
island engraved in this pot here and
then they're all black and really soft
inside these were 24 pounds but I think
that's such a good price considering
what amazing quality the issues really
are so I am very much looking forward to
wearing these and they're just a really
easy shoe to slip on if you're going out
the house and you can't really bother to
like tie your shoelaces and everything
you can just slip these on you're done
and they make it outfit really cool I
think that the gold it definitely makes
it look I don't know like yeah now plain
white I still wear them but I think the
gold makes them look a lot more
expensive so it got these for 24 pounds
I got these a 24 power that I'm in love
with them
so this is kind of like that you could
wear this for a Christmas party or a New
Year's Eve party I probably wear this to
a Christmas party but actually I might
even wear this on New Year's Eve this is
such a cool top it basically is a plain
white one and in a really cool black
font it says Santa is a feminist and I
love this so much this was 16 pounds and
again super nice material super stretchy
it's just very long as well so you can
tuck it you can tie it you can do
everything with it you guys know it like
I said love my tops with writing on it
so I knew as soon as I saw this I had to
pick this up forever the Christmas
season but I'd probably wear this to
like a party and dress it up a bit I
then picked up another pair of jeans and
these are the Harper high-rise super
skinny jeans and these are a lot more
you can feel a record Jeanie material
the others are as well but these are a
lot more stretchy they again don't have
friend pockets but they do have fat
pockets and I've got belt folks this is
the thing I love about river island
jeans because I really want to start
wearing belts but all of my other jeans
don't have belt hooks these want to do
so you can actually wear
with them which I really like but yeah
these are just some really nice plain
black jeans again all the way down to
the bottom and these look a bit longer
so I think I'm gonna end up like rolling
these up but I think that will add to my
outfit and that with this Santa is a
feminist top is gonna look oh well nice
so yeah I love these so much and I'm
very excited to start wearing these out
shoe wise I'd probably dress this up a
little bit like I said and I picked up
these black heeled kind of chelsea boots
these are amazing quality they're suede
here and they're kind of an elasticated
material they say River Island at the
back they've just got the perfect size
heel I've had it so many pairs of
Chelsea boots but never found a pair
that I really really like these are 40
pounds but I don't think that's bad at
all for this type of shoe you can get a
lot more expensive ones and nowhere near
as good quality so amazing and prior to
these and again with that outfit these
would look really nice
you went to a party you could really
dress up the outfit and I had a really
nice clutch bag it's very much
monochrome with the black and white you
could really jazz it up and I picked up
this clutch bag I absolutely adore this
it's plain pink and then it's got this
gold detailing pink glitter here it's
plain pink on the back but the front is
so beautiful it's 26 pounds but then you
open it just going to take out the
cardboard you've just got enough room
trying to put the essentials in and then
you've got this really thin gold chain
if you did wanna wear it and not carry
it like a clutch bag but I love this so
much the detailing is so intricate and
beautiful and so well thought through
that I would literally love to wear this
to a party but honestly this is so so
beautiful and this gold detailing here
as well like everything about this bag
looks expensive then of course it says
river island here so I picked that up to
kind of finish off the New Year's Eve
party outfit vibe and then finally it
for New Year's Day I'd go very very
casual again I attend just either
staying or go out for meals or kind of
just have a walk around with my friends
I never really do that that much so I
thought I'd get kind of like a casual
outfit so I picked up this top again
like I said I love the tops with the
writing on it these are super super in
at the moment as well this is just a
plain white top and it says I'm more on
it and it's got these kind of like
velvet
on it they literally feel like velvet
that's so beautiful
this was 16 pounds again it's a really
nice stretchy material really long you
can tie it you can knot it you can tuck
it in you can leave it out so many
options I would wear that with jeans but
then I also picked up another bag and
this is going to look super super pretty
with it because it's gonna tie in with
the red and it's basically just this bag
here this is more of an everyday bag as
it is a lot bigger it's got the long
strap here and then oh that's different
okay you can have this it open or shut
and then you've got two big zip
compartments and then you've got a big
button compartment with another zipped
compartment there's so many compartments
in this bag which I really like and it's
got a long strap so you so you can have
it on your side but this is such a
gorgeous bag and this was 28 pounds they
do it in black as well and I really want
the black because I thought this is
going to go with items that have red in
it then I also want a black for colors
that read kind of clashes with and the
gold detailing just makes it look so
expensive shoe wise I would probably go
for trainers and I found some gorgeous
trainers on their website I love these
so much I've seen quite a few people
wear these and I feel like they're kind
of like either gonna love them or you're
gonna hate them but I'm the person that
really loves them they are these
trainers they are I don't know how to
explain it to be honest I just got this
gold detailing here and they're all made
up of black and white quite a lot going
on they're quite busy but I really like
them and when you wear them they feel
like socks and you're just walking on
clouds because this part of the shoe
forms around your ankles they're really
really comfy to wear you don't even have
to undo the laces to be honest which is
really nice but I love these it's so
much like I said you either love them or
you're gonna hate them I feel like
they're more of a love them when you see
them in real life now have the bottom
bitter where it's white black white I
think that really adds to it so got
these are 40 pounds but I really do love
these the final thing I picked up you
could kind of wear to a party or even if
you weren't thinking of a casual day and
it's actually this top that I'm wearing
here so it's basically like there's new
ripped crop top but it's got this
amazing detailing so because it kind of
blend into my skin tone it's got a
cutout here and then on the back it's
crisscross obviously I'm gonna do over a
clip so you guys will be able to see
this is super super comfy and you can
also get the matching bottoms to it and
wear as a cohort although I would
probably wear jeans because I'll
probably dress this down rather than
dress it up as the detailing is quite
dressy anyway so there's everything in
my try on a clothing haul I really hope
