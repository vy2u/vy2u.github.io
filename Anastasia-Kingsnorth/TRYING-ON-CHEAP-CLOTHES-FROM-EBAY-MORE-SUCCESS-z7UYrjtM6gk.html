am back and I'm going to be doing trying
on cheap summer clothes I feel like I
said that really would basically I'm
pretty sure you have seen these videos
it kind of flyer on YouTube at the
moment it started up it's kind of to try
it on eBay prom dresses and then it kind
of expanded out to trying on cheap
clothing so I thought I would go
shopping on different places on the
Internet and also in cheap stores and
find some things that I could try on for
you guys to show you that you can
fingers across if they fit find some
really good cheap summer clothes so I
have things from ebay Bromley and
Primark here with me I've got four
things in total and I'm actually really
excited to try these on like I genuinely
have high hopes for them because I
really like all of the things it despite
that the quality kind of differ I really
do like all the things so fingers
crossed that they will look good also
just what I remember I've got some
pretty exciting news so I've actually
started a blog channel where a fingers
crossed
in the end I'm hoping to possibly daily
vlog so head over to the first site in
the description box or somewhere on
screen it will be linked so you can go
and subscribe to my vlog Channel let's
see if we can hit 10,000 subscribers on

be walking around on a Saturday and on
the Sunday I have a meet-up which is on
the ballot so if you do want to meet me
make sure to write my name down on the
ballot system so you have a greater
chance of meeting me and peeking like
half hugs and take cute selfies and it
will be it was so good so yeah I cannot
wait for that so subscribe for daily
vlogging Channel and come in your
summoner city there's my two
announcements but you get other than
that I'm going to get straight on into
the video so I really hope you enjoy it
and let's get started so I think I'm
going to start off with Primark because
that is kind of like the high street
store and I'm really excited about this
actually so the first thing I've had for
maybe like two weeks now ish and it's
basically a bralette and I saw these
going around on the internet and I was
like you know what that's so nice I'm
gonna get that and I'm gonna buy it for
this video she's basically this nude
bralette is kind of like a pastel pink
and it's got this kind of like silky
lining here and then the actual thing is
basically mess
with this floor embroidered pattern on
and these are so fashion at the moment I
absolutely love them I teach them killer
Instagram pictures with them and I just
I don't know I adore them so a new hats
pick one up and it's just in Primark for
eight pounds then what only worry about
this is you are going to be able to see
my nipple through it freezing it but I
don't really want that to happen so I'm
probably gonna have to wear it under
like a mesh top or something but I have
high hopes for this so uh fingers
crossed it will look pretty good for
eight pounds so I now have the bralette
on I have it on underneath this mesh top
because there is just no way that I
would ever go out with just a bra on
like it feels to bare and like my nipple
was going to see through it and it is
like amazing quality for eight pounds
but it just feels too like that I
couldn't do that I just had this like
mesh top on over the top of it but it is
so nice it's so comfy like it doesn't
like it trending the quality of the
material is incredible of eight pounds I
mean I'm not gonna lie can't feeling it
I always 100% recommend them you can get
them in loads of different colors but
it's so cozy and I feel like maybe like
Dix tied up like this for a festival who
knows but I really like it and I'm
definitely gonna be wearing this so it's
like a really hot day the next thing I
have is also from Primark and it's a
bikini now I've seen a lot of these
videos again like trying on flight cheap
bikinis and stuff but I found this in
Primark I knew I have to include this in
the video so it's just a really cute
pastel pink colour with these like palm
green leaves on it and this is so me and
so girly just really liked it so in the
set together was six pounds but she's
like a dirt cheap for a bikini and it
feels really good quality I felt like
it's gonna fit me it's got this little
like frill detailing here I think we'll
just match my Instagram feed perfectly
to be honest and then I have the
matching top here which I also adore
it's exactly the same pattern exactly
the same color it's basically just got
like a tie neck here and then a little
gap where you can get a bit of cleavage
going on if you're feeling it and yeah
then it's just backless and I really
like this and the six pounds for the set
I was like you can't really go wrong the
quality is incredible and I'm really
excited to try this on and fingers
crossed it will fit fingers across it
will look really good because I'm not
gonna lie I don't really want to be
spending like
two pounds in a bikini especially when I
live in England and the weather's like
not that great anyway so six pounds on a
bikini is an absolute bomb what so next
we have the bikini and I'm not gonna lie
I'm sure oh nice is this bikini like I
cannot even get over how much I love
this everything feels really supportive
and like nothing's gonna fall out and I
just love it like it's so comfy and this
is so summery and this is exactly what I
wanted for my summer bikini so these are
the bottoms as well I think these are so
so pretty I literally love them so much
I just can't so not gonna lie this is a
huge success for six pounds and a
hundred percent go to Trimark to get
your bikinis because I mean what the
next place I have things from our eBay
now this is basically a white lace place
OOP not play suit body suits but I've
seen these on a lot of Instagram shops
as well so I know you can get these in a
lot of places and don't really know how
to show it to be honest because it's got
kind of like weird straps but then the
straps basically cross over and it's
just like a white lace bodysuit you'll
be able to tell what when I've got it on
could this just really isn't doing it
justice but it's really really pretty
no oh you realize it unbuttoned that
makes life so much easier but you know I
picked this up for three pounds 50 from
eBay and it took about three weeks to
come but then the instrum company
actually messaged me and then also want
you to send me one so I know you can get
them literally everywhere and I have
high hopes for this even though I'm like
a hundred percent sure this my nipple
wasn't going to show through it so we're
just gonna have to ignore that but yeah
there's no like your nipple covering or
anything like that
so yeah I'm gonna free the nip but I
really like this and I'm I have high
hopes right you can you know like dress
it up weave like a skull at a dress it
down with jeans so I don't know I
thought this is very versatile and
really nice so I have this second one on
and I really like this but I don't have
you been to hell but I've had to put a
nipple cover within bitchy I put it on
and you could just see my nipples like
straight through and I was like okay no
way I can't show himself like this so
I've put the import covers on other than
that how nice is this top well bodysuit
it's so nice and I feel
for summer especially like I will get so
much wear out of this the back as well
like it's got like the crosstie back
which I really like and I think it just
looks really nice it's like jeans or not
obviously if you want to dress it up you
could wear it with like a skirt or
something I really like this and I
thought this is a really good buy
so for what did I pay for this I think
like three pounds something like that
this is so good and this is definitely a
success like just goes to show you don't
have to spend loads of money and I
thought this isn't like the type of
thing is what you see on Instagram a lot
so I mean I got you the final thing I
have is from a wrong way and that he
gave me this to borrow for the video
because she has this one wrong way but
mine hasn't arrived yet so she gave me
this to borrow boots basically white
shorts with black stripes and the
matching crop top which has like a bow
tie on it and a lot of people have these
and I see them all over Instagram all
over Twitter and I'm like that's Owen I
suppose you get that from and this was
actually two pounds fifty now the
quality's actually okay in two parts if
you like I definitely would not complain
about the quality just like this it does
have a little bit of like a smell maybe
you guys know what I mean by the smell
when you order things in like a bay
house that kind of scent but I'm really
excited to try this on okay and honestly
I can't even I'm in love this video
we've been such a success I thought it
was gonna be a fail how nice is this
cord for 2 pound 15 like this is so nice
everything fits me perfectly odds with
you is because I'm normally is small but
this is a medium so this is the only
thing I was to get about for me
personally but honestly I absolutely
love this I would prefer it if there
would be pocket because that would be a
lot more comfortable
honestly I'm obsessed back as well would
like the bow and everything I don't know
I just really like it and I'm so happy
this is just so cute and so summery and
so me and I just loved it so so much I
can't wait for Marvin to revive arrived
canister numbers I am obsessed I love it
water success yeah 100% recommend
success I love them the material is not
itchy at all and it's so comfy so
tightly and on this video I really hope
