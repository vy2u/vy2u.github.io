am back again and I'm here in the car
for like Episode three with my mum and
we are going to be doing the McDonald's
challenge today so after we did our
tasting Starbucks secret menu and the
McDonald's chicken nugget challenge
loads of people were saying they wanted
us to do the tasty McDonald's secret
menu so I've got two different recipes
off of the internet and then we kind of
made two of our own up and they actually
look quite nice like I don't know if I'd
order them because I'm kind of just like
sticking to the same thing
but they actually look kind of nice and
we've got four different burgers to try
for you today some of which have very
very rude names so I do apologize in
advance forget other than that I really
hope you enjoyed the video and let's get
started let's get started not working
today I can't wait to try so the first
burger we're gonna be trying is called
and I didn't name this the Matt gangbang
and basically this is like the two most
famous things from McDonald so a burger
and then a chicken burger all in one
yeah it's quite nice innit though I'm
not gonna chicken and burgers together I
don't think I'm cheating on my knees I
met it now there's gonna be light it's
not gonna taste well okay I'll try a bit
and then you can try that okay
I can't taste the burger I can't taste
the burger I can Intuit the chicken so
again the chicken overtakes it done it
I'm gonna try it again I mean I'm not a
huge fan it got on something that you do
not me let my dogs
oh no I do I didn't like that one
alright okay that's very nice it just
doesn't the chicken overpowers the
chicken area of powers and it just
doesn't taste like that nice overall so
the Matt gangbang and whoever gave it
that name is useful in it that was a
no-go the next one I'm pretty proud
because I made it named myself and I
actually think it's quite Sookie ready
chicken baguette what's that man oh the
chicken nugget one chicken chicken get
now get okay ladies literally a burger
with chicken nuggets mayonnaise and
lettuce I think this is gonna be quite
nice actually
mm-hmm that's well nice like I don't
know if it girls would make it like we
made it ourselves if I make sense like
we didn't order that
but that's really nice that chickens a
lot more hmm yeah great okay well me
personally about three day because I
just can't stand it it's so plastic
taste it but there's so plastics I'm
very I think I'll just have so much of
it in my life uh quiche con I just don't
know how long it's been around did you
have it when you're a kid yeah yes it
tastes the same without this imagine it
did I can't remember McDonald's like
that sticks in my mind was one at
Bedford and it used to have upset you
just have a little train there from you
strap that birthday parties on yeah oh
yeah creepy town all right here okay
this next one is called the double chip
whopper and this is a double
cheeseburger with chips in the middle
kick this would be quite nice I think
this is gonna be quite as it actually
looks really sick remember
mmm that's good funny Pam I knew yeah
there's a monstrous yeah creepy yeah
yeah yo Hanukkah yeah
I don't I kick okay right though I think
this must be quite on
you obviously sent to the funny pattern
life for you to know then yeah you you
notice the funny pattern Peter yeah it's
not right so I can't go into the funny
pan huh I don't really like that weird
taste of it if you like that it's all
got a weird taste to it I know oh yeah
me neither
I don't know I can't make up my mind I
don't know if I could eat that like as a
meal that's the best one so far yeah I
think you've had three bites of it so
you must like it to a point it's just
like putting having a bite of cheese
burger and putting a chip in your mouth
at the same time Oh nothin everything
fit like that this last one is
apparently called the muck cheap Mac and
this is basically a double cheeseburger
but with Big Mac sort instead of tomato
and mustard about this on the radio
it said this is meant to be like a
cheaper version of a Big Mac if it is
I'm actually to be really happy because
I love Big Macs but what they are
expensive in there I'm Charlie 369 what
for one Big Mac without kids yeah and
she's eat food and 5000 K but obviously
the bund isn't good and it doesn't look
as tall but like no it's still the same
thing I know let's try it often this is
up to you quite nice
that's not a Big Mac is it mm-hmm that's
so nice hmm that's exactly off the Big
Mac yes nice cheaper than half the price
go to McDonald's and if you like Big
Macs but you don't want to pay like that
amount of money literally just say can I
have a double cheeseburgers instead just
tastes like a Big Mac cash-strapped the
cash we've come to McDonald's available
in two burgers to try on the inside
mum's little story she wants to tell you
before we finish it's gone okay I was
walking it I was walking through town
today on our way to the library enroute

oh roots failure my cultural cultural
intelligent self which I am so let it go
into a closed shop I'll go to the
library
yep so call them books with me at home
