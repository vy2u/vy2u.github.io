back with a types of people on snapchat
now you guys know that in the past I've
done a few skip type videos and this
week I wanted to do another one because
you guys seem to love them and I've
recently come up with a bunch of ideas
for different skits and this week I just
felt like Du Monde for snapchat now if
you don't know what's up chat is it is
basically a social media platform where
you can send photos or videos of
yourself for 10 seconds to other people
who you are your friends on there and
you can add things to your story which
stay on there for 24 hours now you will
come across many types of people on
snapchat I know that I have I have God
knows how many people on snapchat and I
see everybody's stories and I've
definitely come across certain types of
snapchatters but please remember I'm not
trying to offend anybody by doing this
video because literally half the ones
that I'm saying I do it is literally
just a purely a joke and I thought you
guys might like it as it's a bit of fun
it make a joke out of a humorous
situation and yeah that's basically it
also make sure to add me on snapchat
shameless self promo I don't even care I
love snapchat I'm always lying thanks to
my story and a load of behind the scenes
stuff so I'll put my Kodi thingy on the
screen and my name so make sure to go
add me but yeah other than that I hope
you doing the video and let's get
started
so the first person on snapchat is the
girl or boy who is obsessed with the
puppy-dog filter now I feel like this
has started down a little bit but a few
months ago this was at its peak and you
wouldn't see a selfie anywhere on all
the social medias without the dog filter
okay we need a new selfie using the dog
filter oh I don't know if I'm feeling
these angles but it's blurring my skin
so good all right you don't know what to
do I mean I've only got about 100 of
these on my Instagram should I take
another one or use a different filter no
I think we use this filter
we'll go with that one
the next type of personal snapchat which
I feel life is actually kind of me is
the person who always uses a filter I
don't mean the filters that you swipe
across I mean the filters that you put
on your face
I have a little obsession with the like
yellow one was at the butterfly crown I
really really like that I use it for
like every Satur I send sorry I really
like that filter I love the puppy-dog
filter but I love the yellow one but
there are some people who like put it on
their story like constantly like selfie
up to selfie after selfie with a
different filter don't get me wrong I
love seeing people selfies I'm happy
that they're posting selfies but when
you see them over and over and over and
over again with a different filter it
can get slightly annoying guys you know
what I love snapchat filters summer play
hockey
oh that's so cute kind of scary
that's hideous
okay oh so it's kind of free that's
freaky
I like that one yeah not feeling that
either I don't get the point of this one
was even to do here no then you have the
person who forever snapchats this is the
person who constantly has their phone
out with them and whenever they see
something too interesting
they have to snapchat it also life is
not worth living oh my god my crush like
my tweet
I need snapchat it he liked my feet AB
story Oh a love Selena Gomez's outfit I
better snapchat it everybody's gonna
want to know that I love it so that's my
story
love Selena's outfit hashtag slay ah all
Zoe's uploaded prymaat cool I've got a
snapchat it before I watch it got it
quickly the next person that I came up
with is someone that I am definitely not
but I know a lot of people who are and
it is the streak obsessed person there
are so many people that are obsessed
with streaks and the street like their
snapchat streak is their life like if
they lose it their life's over and I
think it's hilarious so I definitely
come across a few of those people in my
time and to be honest I couldn't care
less about streaks but I know some
people do and it's hilarious I feel like
I'm forgetting something
statcast reeks oh my god okay um streaks
fire emoji heart emoji monkey emoji leaf
emoji times ten one two whoa
just the next person snapchat is the
artsy person now by artsy I mean the
person who takes every single shot on
their snapchat from an amazing angle
with an amazing filter with amazing
colors of amazing things in and the
whole snapchat is just perfect
I have seen a few of these people on
snapchat and is just like don't get me
wrong there snapchat story is flawless
but it's a little bit like okay got a
cuter up no need to snapchat it this is
this is just how I emptied my makeup bag
I definitely didn't put it like this
okay that's such cute angle oh that's
such a cute photo that's death going on
my story
this person has to be my favorite
because it's definitely me is the food
obsessed snapchatter the person who
wherever they are no matter what they're
doing whenever they get the food they
have to snapchat it because I have to
let everybody know that they're eating
this is so true for me and my friends
whenever we go out for dinner or level
we're out say if like all the pizzas
come out at Pizza Hut
everybody's like stop snapchat and we
will just stand up in a line with our
phones pointing down on the pizzas and
we're all getting photos because we have
to tell everybody that we're eating
pizza because that's the day and age we
give it now oh my god okay I know I've
eaten the whole box and I went to Donuts
and I saw checked that earlier but I
need to snap out a little update update
everybody ate the whole box don't even
care donuts fix everything
hashtag goals hashtag games everybody's
gonna love it the last person I came up
with on snapchat is kinda me
kind of feel like it's everybody to a
point and it's a selfie obsessed person
this is kind of like the filter obsessed
except this person is posting photos
from every single angle are the 368
words you can get I have quite a lot of
these on snapchat and needless to say
does get a little annoying because I
feel like one selfie is enough but each
your own if you want to post a thousand
selfies because you're feeling happy go
for okay I need a new selfie haven't
took one in about ten minutes so let's
take a new one
no no that's okay but I mean you can do
more you know we'll add more to my story
anyway yeah that's cute Oh Hallie only
33 selfies on my story I think I need to
make it up to 40 so that was the end of
my video I really really really hope you
enjoyed it this again it's just a huge
like hilarious piss-take it's not
serious at all it's just my observations
of people I've seen on my snapchat make
sure we're going to go add my snapchat
there's like ridiculous amounts of
people on there now I think there's like
30,000 of you which is like
mind-boggling but let's see if we can
get 50,000 people on my snapchat so go
add me again it'll be on the screen and
in the description also my friend
Spencer actually did a lyric prank on me
