emergency broadcast system announcing
the commencement of the annual purge
sanctioned by the US government weapons
of class four and lower have been
authorized for use during the purge all
other weapons are restricted government
officials of ranking 10 have been
granted immunity from the purge and
shall not be harmed commencing at the
siren any and all crime including murder
will be legal for 12 continuous hours
police fire and emergency medical
services will be unavailable until
tomorrow morning at 7 a.m. when the
purge concludes blessed be our new
founding fathers and America a nation
reborn may God be with you all
the first thing I'm gonna be taking is a
primer and I'm just going to be using
the benefit Porefessional to prime all
of my face ready for the heavy makeup
the purge people have flawless skin so
I'm reusing the Bourjois healthy mix
foundation in beige which is really
orange for me because I want you to look
like a mask and it just gives a flawless
coverage I'm just gonna be blending this
in with the Real Techniques buffing
brush to conceal any imperfections I'm
using your collection lasting perfection
concealer to settle that I'm gonna be
using stay matte powder to begin my eyes
are we were taking the elf coffee
eyeliner and drawing it around my eye or
where I can fill my eyeball at the
bottom and where I can feel my like brow
bone at the top I was going to join an
oval around my eye and then agree
shading it in with the sleek oh storm
palette and I'm just gonna be using the
brown out of that which is a matte brown
to give off the effect that I'm looking
through the eye holes only darkening up
the inner corner in the outer corner of
the circle on each eye with a really
dark brown from that palette again and
then with the black from that palette
I'm going over with the dark brown just
to give it a lot more definition and
really make it look like I'm seeing out
of the holes
to make the eyes stand out I only taking
these soap and glory super cat liquid
liner and just carefully going around
the outer rim of the circle to begin my
lips I'm gonna be first of all painting
my bottom lip with a white face paint
and this is going to act as my teeth and
then with a dark red eyeshadow which is
kind of brown on camera I'm really read
wrong on my bottom lip underneath my
actual bottom lip and drawing a top lip
really wide on my top and then just
taking the eyeliner again I'm gonna be
drawing teeth onto my lips
to begin the crazy contour in this mass
house I'm gonna be just lining where I
want the contour to be and then buffing
it all in with a black on my brush at
the same time and this just really makes
my face a bucket standing out I was
going to be highlighting it with some
white paint and that is the makeup look
complete
for my hair I just left it down a messy
and then for my outfit I just took a
white school shirt which obviously I
can't wear anymore under the fake blood
and my friend has put it all over me and
he just smudged in all into my shirt and
on my neck and I just blended all that
in and that was basically my outfit and
I just paired that with some black
leggings and then I got a fake axe from
home bargains this outfit is really
inexpensive and other than that axe you
should probably be able to make this out
of all of the things you already have at
home so that is the end of my video I
hope you have enjoyed it make sure you
