today's video as you guys can tell by
the title I am back with my first prom
video of the year actually I don't even
think I've ever done a problem video so
this is pretty good for me today I am
actually going to be testing out eBay
prom dresses and now obviously prom
season is coming up for America
apologies actually like happening now or
people are proposing because I'm seeing
those of promposals on the internet we
don't really do that here in the UK or
if you do you're lucky but I know that
my prom at last year was in June and
it's now May and I definitely started to
look for dresses by now and as these are
from eBay if you do like the look of
them they tend to take a few weeks to
arrive so I thought you know what I'm
gonna do a testing ebay dress this video
I have got for prom dresses to test for
you guys today I'm very excited I
haven't seen any of them this is gonna
be a complete first not first impression
but first one it kind of is but yeah I
hope you guys enjoy it and let's get
into the video so dress number one is in
this great package now I said you guys I
haven't seen any and I happened but it
is still in here but basically as I said
these do take a couple of weeks to
arrive so when this parcel arrives I
kind of forgot that I'd been ordering
prom dresses from eBay and I was like
why is this like it turned it like three
weeks after I was like what on earth is
this and I opened it I don't know it was
my first prom dress so that's why this
one's open but I haven't actually looked
at the dress this dress is white or
cream or ever color if the equators
cream on it it does look a bit the other
way I honestly don't even remember the
size of this dress so I'm gonna put it
on screen so you guys can see first
impression of it who is actually not
that bad obviously it's not really
expensive feeling but it's not cheap
feeling either oh I can't remember this
dress this is like a halter neck one so
this is actually really similar to my
prom dress and mine was a black I'll
also put a picture on screen and my prom
dress so you guys can see but this one
is really really cool actually it's
basically my prom dress and it's just
white and it's just a halter neck you
tie it at the back you can tie it in a
bow and it's just got like a long train
it reminds me a little bit of like a
wedding dress or a bridesmaid's dress
but either way after you can still wear
it to prom people
white and cream dresses to my prom so
obviously it's like it doesn't have to
be for a wedding I can't really tell
anything else until I've got it on
because it might be really see through
and actually I think it might be see
through but I only paid for this like
fifteen or sixteen pounds and honestly
my prom dress cost like a hundred and
fifty pounds so if I'd have known I
could have gotten it for a lot cheaper
than I definitely would off I have
gotten a prom dress at number one and
honestly I am so impressed so as you
guys that have already seen my prom -
from last year was a black and it
literally looked exactly like this we
actually had to get a dress cut up and
remade to make it like this and I've
just found it on eBay but in white but
they also offered it in black for 15
pounds so it's a halter neck and
obviously I do have a bra on but you
just tie it at the back here and then it
all droops down here which mine didn't
actually do which I really wanted mine
to do and then obviously you've got this
bit here so you've got a little bit of
cleavage and then it goes down into this
waistband here and then the material
flows as I will show you guys at the
bottom the only thing I would say with
the white it does look a bit like a
bridesmaid's dress or a wedding dress so
maybe I would stay away from the white /
cream color and I would go for maybe a
red this would be really nice in I feel
like in this material red would look a
bit cheap so I would probably go for
black just so it looks a bit more
expensive in a bit more elegant but
honestly I am so impressed with this
dress I swear to God if I have my prom
this year and I have this in black I
would actually wear this dress I just
feel very supported in it and the
material at all is not cheap yes it does
crease a little bit but obviously you're
going to expect that for the price that
I paid but honestly I am really really
impressed and I am absolutely in love
with this dress dress that number two is
this one here and I have no idea what
this one is how do I open it yet so we
need to get it open they really do
well okay so this one is got loans to
still the seat things on it which I feel
like is actually different to our the
one that I ordered
I personally don't remember there being
a load of silver sequins but you know
okay this does look kind of similar to
the one that I ordered I'm pretty sure
when I ordered it it was gold and not
silver and again we can't really tell
and so I've got it on but it's just like
a strappy one like this the straps are
literally just elastic bands or like
elastic which kind of looks a bit cheap
but other than that I mean I can't
really complain because it's actually
quite nice I have now got on the next
dress and I'm definitely not mad about
this one either this one I think was a
little bit more expensive than the
others just purely because it is
completely made out of sequins as you
guys can see I have actually decided to
take my bra off for this one because
like the other one this one is actually
backless and I wanted you guys to be
able to get the full effect of why it's
actually like so this is the front like
I said I have took my bra off it's just
all sequins it's just these really thin
straps the only thing that I think looks
really cheap on this dress is the strap
so this very thin is literally just
elastic like if you'd bought elastic
from a shop that is what it is I feel
like if they've covered that up with
Cermak just normal white material then
it wouldn't look as cheap but I'm not
gonna complain because my hair just kind
of covers it so then it goes down into
this kind of like triangular neck type
thing it's really really nice and then
it just slows it down the only bit I'm
in not too keen on is the bottom which I
will also show you guys there's a solid
line it doesn't like flow fully it kind
of curves around your bum and it's very
tight-fitting until it gets to your
knees which is when it flows out but it
always it just have a little train as
well which i think is quite cute and
that's very prom like so I want to say
this dress isn't bad at all there the
back is backless but it's got these like
two elastic things here and then as you
can see it just kind of curves to the
bottom of my bum here I think this fits
really nice this is really flattering
about how it does that and I do really
like it although I'm pretty sure that I
did order it in gold and not silver
that's the only issue with this one but
honestly I'm at
you're gonna give this probably an eight
or a nine out of ten because if I again
had a frog I would definitely consider
wearing this it's really nice it's
really flowy you really cannot complain
about it and the quality is so good
considering I got this from eBay I
really think this one was about 35 40
pounds so that was like a quarter of
what I pay for my prom dress last year
but honestly it was really really good
I'm very impressed third one here again
I haven't opened it by taxi so elaborate
event this is the bright blue one and I
ordered pretty cool color I wanted to
find out you know like if I can show you
guys all of the event options again
don't remember the style of this but
let's try and figure out what it was oh
okay so I think this one was a Bardot
one but it literally looks like inside
out at the top even though it's not
meant to be obviously we'll have to try
this on but it literally looks inside
out and it's actually not so I don't
really know what's going on here and it
looks quite short for me the next one
I've got on as you can see is the blue
one and I think again this is really
nice
personally this isn't my style of dress
like if I was going to choose a prom
dress I definitely wouldn't go for blue
just because I don't feel like blue is
my color and yeah I'm not really sure
about the style of the dress for me
personally but I can appreciate it
actually have really nice contracts so
it comes off your shoulder like this I
thought first of all the shots went all
the way up and then I realize it's still
an off the shoulder dress you just got
this kind of cutout thing here the
threads are badly like falling out and
pulling and you can see the stitching
here which I feel like is the downside
to the dress because other than that it
would be really pretty there's also a
sit in the leg and again this is the
perfect length to me it just kind of
droops down there just a little bit of
material on the floor which I like and
the slit is at the perfect size on it my
leg it just starts on my authority just
below my bum and yeah I just think it's
really really pretty I do really like
this dress I feel like it might be a
little bit too big for me around here
maybe you need to be a little bit more
tighter so it could be a bit more
flattering the back that you just looks
like this it's very plain this one isn't
back to us obviously because it's a
Bardot one and yeah I fully thought that
you liked
like this and I was like that doesn't
look right then I realized to wear it
like that but yeah I'm appreciated
there's a very nice dress I mean
personally not familiar but I can
appreciate that it's nice as a dress as
a whole I'm probably gonna give this one
a 7 it's not my favorite one this is
definitely like my least favorite so far
so I say I'm gonna write this like a 7
I'm gonna say like a sick note 6 is too
harsh but I thought I've been eights too
good so I feel like 7 is kind of perfect
final one here in this package again 1/2
different the top off so easy for me to
get I only care i remember this one this
one is black and silver again I'm really
annoyed that that other one is silver
but it was definitely gold I ordered it
online so I remember thinking I'll get
one silver and one gold this one has got
like a sequins at the top and then it
flows down into this like a black silk
dress again this does feel quite cheap
but then you can't expect for it to feel
really expensive when you're already
paying like 16 to 20 pounds this bit is
complete just like fabric what somebody
has sewn together and then it's got like
a little waistband and then it's silver
and I don't really know how the sleeve
go but we all figure that one out and I
have on at the final dress really an
oily this is definitely too big for me
there's bit kind of just troops and my
boobs are actually falling out at the
side as you can probably see I comment I
wear a bra with this either because I
figured out how this goes it's actually
like a halter neck one and you just kind
of like Pyatt at the back so it is
mostly that close all round here
actually is all back fits I don't know
why I said mostly but the material on
this one definitely looks cheap so I'm
honestly gonna say this is probably the
worst one out of the four just because
one it doesn't fit me properly and the
materials quite it she liked this neck
needed to be up here and then that would
have fitted me but he said it's down
here in this material literally it does
look like you've just gone to a shop and
just sewn it but like not good shop yeah
I'm really not a fan of this dress I
feel like if it was like made properly
then I'd really like it but even the way
it flows the material which is too thick
it's just not a good one and this was a
size extra small as well so he's
actually knows smaller I could have gone
with this dress and I'm actually kind of
tall like I'm like 5 foot 5 so I'm not
really that tall but yeah this
definitely isn't my favorite dress out
of them or I can appreciate that it
nice dress and a lot of people do have
this style dress to prom but I ain't
feeling this one
it's annoying though I thought this is
going to be really nice actually but
it's just annoying because they're
materializing these sequins is like an
itchy mesh and all round here just burnt
so yeah I'm honestly gonna give this one
like a 4 and that's not me being harsh
it just doesn't fit me and it doesn't
sue me at all
so as a dress as a whole I say you know
you could get away with it but I'm
personally gonna give it a 4 so that's
the end of this video I really hope you
guys have enjoyed seeing you try and try
on some email prom dresses I really
enjoy it because honestly I understand
that people can't always afford to spend
a lot of money on prom and you can
actually find some really good dresses
on eBay they may not be the most
expensive thing and they may not be the
most amazing dress you could ever get
but they're actually really good and I
do understand that sometimes it's all
people can afford so I really hope you
guys enjoyed if you did please smash a
huge thumbs up let's see if we can smash
15,000 likes on this video and other
than that I will see you on Wednesday at
6 p.m. at a brand new video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
