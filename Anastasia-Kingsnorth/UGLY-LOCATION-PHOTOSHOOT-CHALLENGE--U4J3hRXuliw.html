today's video I am going to be taking on
a challenge has kind of gone on YouTube
at the moment a lot of people have been
doing it and I thought you know what I
want to do it so this is the ugly
location a photoshoot challenge now I
have no idea who started this but I've
seen a lot of people do it like niki and
gabi alicia marie and a few other
youtubers when i searched it yeah but
you know what that actually is such a
good idea
Photography is something that I really
really love and the background can
determine whether a picture is a really
good one or a bad one so I thought you
know what by trying to take on this
challenge and trying to find the most
ugly at backgrounds that we could would
be really really funny so I went to
London with my T friends and Byron and
we tried to find some pretty ugly
locations and then Byron took some
photos of me and today I knew showing
you how it all turned out so I hope you
guys enjoy this video if you do please
smash a huge thumbs up and other than
that let's get into the video
the first location that we actually went
to was the Obinna move in there
University and it was basically a really
a dirty disgusting room and it just was
filled with bins and rubbish and it's
smell there was flies and there was like
a few random as the trolleys and this is
what we managed to capture so this is
location 1 this was Byron as an idea
we're actually in
a ton of things and is controlling but
although you know
actually smells like a fortune from the
rubbish dump yeah so this is a great
they go good all I got there boom
they're all like oh my god they're
really good like you were really good
oh my gosh oh you can make anyway
honestly the photos turned out so good
from this room look I did not expect it
at all the first one I got was really
cool I'm basically sitting on a trolley
and I've got like a newspaper that was
laying on the trolley I've got my
glasses on I mean this kind of like a
baby blue suit which I thought would be
really cool for all of these photos and
then I've got just my like Air Force on
and I've got this outfit on and all of
the photos but as you can see the bins
are in the background I'm sitting on the
trolleys I don't think it looks really
edgy and then we've got some close-up
shots which I think a really really cool
barman is such a good photographer and I
actually think these photos are really
amazing considering the background isn't
exactly great and yeah like a flower
wall probably would look better but I
actually think they turned out really
really good
the next place that we decided to go to
was on the way to the tube station and
we decided to stop this kind of
construction work area it was basically
where a few builders were fixing
something in the road and there was like
the borders up and there was those of
stuff up we thought you know what this
is a location
the photo has turned out really cool
here I kind of just leant on the purple
with the red and the white which was
really cool and it's got all of the
construction stuff in the background the
summers proper beaming on me which was
really really cool I really like how it
turned out and that was basically that
word I thought that was a really cool
one I wasn't even going to do that as a
location but it was next drawing that we
found on the way to thought why not
the next location that we went to was a
tube station and I thought this this is
the one that I had in mind because tube
stations aren't necessarily ugly but
they're not exactly the prettiest things
and I thought okay I don't know what
we're going to be able to do in a tube
station but I just thought we would try
it the first picture I think is so cool
I had my hand on the glass in the
waiting room and then Byron stood one
side and I stood the other and he shot
through the glass so that was really
really cool you could see me in the
background I'm in focus but my hands out
of focus and I thought that was such a
cool photo and then I got somewhere I
was leaning on the edge of the tube we
actually struck proper lucky we went to
a tube station where really nobody was
out I think it was White City or East
act and I'm not really sure I can't
remember but it was a tube station where
nobody was out and there was a tube that
was out of service so I just lent on the
tube as it wasn't moving I thought well
perfect opportunity and we got some
really cool shots and then I also got
some further back shots where you can
kind of see more of the tube in the
background and honestly it really does
go to show that if you're good at taking
photos the background doesn't
necessarily matter because the
background actually looks so sticking
these photos and then at the last
location that we kind of went to it was
more like a skate park but it wasn't
like a skate park it was more just er
have you ever run down area in
Shoreditch where there wasn't really
much there there was a lot of graffiti
there was a lot of rubbish on the floor
it was just a bit all over the place
really I feel like the photos that we
got here what actually the best and I'm
honestly in love with them here is it
location number two we've come to this
at bridge it's not exactly like ugly but
it's not like the prettiest thing that
we could find so we thought this would
work for an ugly location but there's
some pretty cool graffiti is
and now we've got all of this like
graffiti stuff here as well this is
really cool this unlike animals on here
I actually really like this one either
it's going to be ugly but I really do
like it I think it's really cool I feel
like we kind of smash this first of all
we got somewhere I'm kind of looking
through a fence so I've got my hands on
it the fence is in focus but I'm out of
focus and as you can see in the
background it's just kind of graffiti
wall was kind of gravel there's rubbish
there's a few cars it's not the
prettiest thing but the filter makes it
look a lot better than it actually was
and then I've got my hands on the
railings and I'm looking through them
and I feel like that angle makes the
photo look really cool and edgy and I
feel like I forgot it kind of slashed
that one then we moved on a bit and we
found some more graffiti walls which I
think were really cool as well and I put
my hands up in the air and I thought
that was really cool I wanted to do some
poses from my la photos because I took
this photo when I was in LA and I loved
it so I thought I'm gonna copy the pose
and then we found this kind of plank of
wood that was on a bit of a hill and I
was on a bit of a slant so I stood on
that and we got some low body shots and
you can see the kind of the rest of the
Construction Yard and the buildings in
the background and this photo is so cool
that was the best idea to stand on that
house has his idea shout out to you
house and then we found at this graffiti
wall that had some pink and some blue
and my favorite colors pink and I
thought even though it's meant to be
ugly like I like the color pink so we'll
stand here and this is actually one of
my favorite photos if not my favorite
photo that we got I just really like the
way that I'm standing in it but I feel
like I know it looks really cool and
edgy and the fact that my suits blue and
the background is like black and pasto I
feel like it really ties in and then we
found this massive red bin that was also
graffiti'd on it and it was in some like
gravel and there was like bricks around
it and stuff it was quite messy and it
was quite like oh but we got such cool
photos so I kind of got down on the
ground I was crouching it looked really
really cool and how my sunglasses and we
got like some shots whilst I was on the
ground then we got this one shot which I
am obsessed with and
just wore off a head shot even though
it's still got like majority of my body
in but you can see like I don't know why
I just love this photo so much you can
see that you've got the bin and the
brick in the background and yes it
doesn't look great but I just really
liked how I looked in this photo I just
thought it was really pretty those are
all the photos from that section and
then I was actually one more potently
win and it wasn't exactly Oakley but it
was fake so we went to Camden Market and
we went up to a rooftop bar and there
was his background and there was lots of
flowers on it there was plastic
flamingos it was really really cool and
I really liked it but it looked very
fake so Byron was like okay then we
should get you sitting on it and we can
see how real we can make it look and so
I know where are we we are even though
it's like pretty it's like fake and it
looks folks we're gonna try and make it
look as real as can you do it yes you
can
so burn what happened in the camera
basically when we were shooting in the
bin shed I had my camera on the wrong
setting because yesterday I filmed over
not filming a different said it's a
second floor I was in I don't think so
the first bar a little blurry
the first way that we've got is actually
really cool and it does look like I'm
into some sort of I don't know like zoo
ish or like a jungle
it should I'm not really a jungle but I
don't know it looks like I'm in a
different country
it looks like I'm somewhere really hot
and really like exotic and I really like
how it turned out so that is the end of
this video I really hope you guys have
enjoyed it I was so excited to do this
video I love going on photo shoots and
all my favorite things to do and trying
to find ugly locations in London was
actually quite hard because we didn't
just want to do all graffiti walks he
wanted to find other locations just that
because I think graffiti was actually
really cool so yeah that was the end of
the video I really hope you guys enjoyed
it thank you so much to Bharat and house
for helping me out on it the video I
couldn't have done it without you guys
please it gives video a huge thumbs up
if you did enjoy it let's see if we
could smash 12,000 lights in the first
24 hours because that would be insane
but thank you so much for watching I
really hope you guys have enjoyed and I
will see you on Wednesday at 6 p.m. if a
brand new video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
