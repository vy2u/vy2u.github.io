babe saffron and we're doing a Q&amp;amp;A me
but first of all sorry for my voice a
bit alright now but we still wanted to
film we didn't have a videos we wanted
to film together but please try and
ignore how bad I sound
you really don't sound that bad and
people say they find it really sexy when
I have a voice like this
well yeah everybody's laugh I know is it
everybody's like your voice is so sexy
when you sound like that bombs like no
because I can feel how am i sound but
nevertheless we're still filming anyway
and today we did a Q&amp;amp;A I've been trying
to make at Anna as best as I can have a
nice laughing like you don't sit her she
took on a fast outfit because of me I
did I look six tablets of that I've
never never swallow tablet before so
saffice done it so we also filmed a
video over on saffron's channel which i
already think you should go and check
out I will link it down below in the
description box first our description go
over there subscribe if you haven't
already because I you okay so go so
million yeah so close to please we film
like a what do we film oh yeah we've
found Lego tips and advice for like if
you want something you need to channel
well that's a software that we use and
like all our advice and fun it's a good
really cool video that's already called
make it out if you wanna call it to
coach James no we're both there laughs
we're both ears our own like I just
sound more ill your voice all right
my voice was awful the entire time I was
in sweetly and I've had getting better
today hey so without further ado we just
we get straight on into the queue and
networks okay first question if you are
both crushing on the same guy do you
think you still try to talk to him or
drop it for your friendship
oh these are very like friendship relate
your questions that people were asked oh
that's really hard I don't know like if
it kind of pens like that's really hard
isn't it it depends what sort of crush
it is yeah same result with both crush
on and Zac Efron always rifle oh my god
I speak to fall at all McGrew both fancy
him and he work for Anna of like oh my
god gone Anna yes Jamie and I know she
be the same with me yeah I'm gonna cause
half you go yeah I didn't never be a boy
that like I don't know
I can't imagine like us ever fallen out
over a boy and everybody I mean we're
both you're talking - yeah exactly I
mean if we're both talking to them they
cleaned that guy's doing something wrong
yeah exactly
so I don't feel like we ever would drop
a friendship over that I neither die
tonight I mean I think either likes it
more as well yes I go question one
youtuber that you would both go out with
Oh does it to come personality-wise I
have no idea I didn't know like um okay
ah ah that's really hard I didn't like
pre think about my offices so yeah I
don't know and I haven't had these
questions like yes I would know how to
clean them I would probably say I think
I'd say Grayson burned
oh yeah olefins yeah I don't know it but
like we don't know them now we don't
know though so I feel like if it looks
wise and yeah but I don't know their
personality I don't know if we'd even
get along so that was our answer based
on looks
yeah diamonds only is any youtubers I
want to think yes no neither really good
you knowing that I'd like you yeah I
don't think there is if you could
eliminate one week from your life's what
would it be
Oh in what circumstance I think what
just anything and if your worries or I
know I would be I know what would you be
alright if I can eliminate something I
would eliminate the fact that I don't
ever think I care because I overthink so
much
I sometimes it would drive me said if I
didn't overthink I loved her as I just
loved to live it up okay I think I would
love to eliminate me eating unhealthy
honestly I would kill to laugh yeah
actually I would eliminate me being so
fussy I kind of heart that eliminating
it it's kind of like eliminating it
though sounds like you're gonna like but
I am I really struggled to eat healthy
and I really I know modest and I would
generally love that so eliminate
to be unhealthy like taking all the
rubbish out of my life like that be yeah
so good to be like the eating point
taken away Sony takeaways I eat as well
yeah I don't really get takeaways but I
just a nice taco do y'all think you so
many don't doze yeah but that's better
that's like hell cuz I know I've chipped
something I just have plain chicken and
then I just get a corn cob that's true
you aren't your healthy would you ever
have a baby with the last person you
texted at if so would you name it no
who's the last person okay the last
presentation with you oh my god gibbyyyy
no oh we can't really buy I would have a
baby if I could adopt I actually what I
really sorry don't go down there baby
I love you so much to phrase it
I don't know I will your parents know
might be very good parents together
mommy are you but if I had the option I
would it would be kind of fun yeah
because like we're so similar yet so
yeah not alike yeah did I mean it wasn't
Heidi I'm so messy I'm so like I don't
they got us as well by fine I'm so like
I chat so much with you share with my
family is like yeah all you need to be
so dead straight in the yellow car fake
yeah yeah it would be yeah it actually
would be that's such a good point yeah I
do you think about this is asked by
Carly hmm is it true you guys are
secretly dating yes it is no no I mean
uh we made a fish on Facebook as like a
joke on the relationship series and I
think some people found it and they were
like oh so guys I even find that I don't
know like people actually get more going
on yeah we know she just did it as a
joke as I can face book thing because we
were always joking like oh no nothing's
like official until you put it on
Facebook hmm oh no we're not secretly
dating right what is one of your biggest
regrets
oh my biggest regret I feel like I
already have many regrets in life
neither because everything I always
believe everything happens for a reason
yeah sometimes I have no idea
without the reason is yeah but I am I
don't really know that's real good I
mean at the China's like argh
right doing yeah that's obviously happen
more I think looking back you like how I
learnt from it yeah so you can learn so
yeah I don't really think I have a good
particular like I regret that yeah yeah
no neither so many people ask this
question how did you two meet each other
and what was your first initial reaction
on each other oh he was explain it I
don't know seems a bit like I don't know
we met through YouTube we've met through
YouTube we just messaged each other I
think I call it all your videos like the
first ever video then we met in April
last year
no yeah yeah fast yeah yeah yeah whoa so
we only known each other know about a
year roughly that's cream I'm gonna find
the picture the first of a picture we
took together and put on screen yeah the
first day we met each other was a photo
with film with each other yes and I know
I was really nervous of it I was so
nervous nervous at the time I don't know
but we literally immediately clicked we
don't cut it away yo my oh nice and then
we didn't see each other for ages and
then we started to see each other like
so regularly yeah I know we just see
each other all the time
so is that you children but if so how
many would you have oh I won three
children's yes I do
I want three and I think it's mainly
it's probably because I have two
brothers so I've always always been
about you been second heart but I've
always have been thrown a thought I
don't know I would I definitely want
children I mean I would never want to
have a single I know a lot of people
that sing which I love being a single
child because you get so spoiled but I
want because I've been brought up with
my brothers and staff have always had
somebody to play where everyone's jamai
me and Horsehead friend and too many
matches always really three so I really
want two kids you know I wouldn't like a
boy a girl Bobby you can't choose but I
want twins do you think I want win so
bad so bad why if you had a triplet I
don't want oh you know that won't be sad
to happen but I don't want triplets know
if I would love twins almost two things
I
in love it yeah because I could grow up
together yeah because it's a major
meeting together and I got all the
outfits oh I picked this one because I
know the answer straightaway whose
precisely to do their makeup and then
redo it because they don't like it me
saffron sometimes we just do not make
averages like I know it doesn't look
quite like no staff it does not do it
again I just wiped it off to sue it yeah
because nothing more bugs me and to be
fair I would say if we're both getting
ready at the same time yeah you would
take longer now yeah I would say longer
now if faison Colin finished about the
same time I got going for you because I
got on my brows done and stuff like I
don't need to do my brows my god yeah I
feel like I'm just sorted like I don't
really do much to my makeup that much
anymore you don't kind of hat I've had
the eyelash trick which has to be awful
so yeah I feel like I would be the one
to redo it beautifies a longer yeah
the last question is the thing you hate
most and love most about YouTube but you
to other things going about to say about
each other about YouTube I do the first
okay they one love loves it's probably
meeting everybody I love me and I'd be
so much like just walking down the
street and just like saying hi to you
guys or like events or me SSF I just
don't mean you guys hate the most
I don't really know what do you hate
most about there's nothing like I really
hate about it well so sup of love
yes that was love fur so I always got
asked this question and my favorite
thing about YouTube again yeah I mean it
is you guys as everybody that watches my
videos every year at the support I get
from people is crazy and obviously again
I literally love meeting people like
it's funny that we'll be able to get
than people were like oh my god we saw
you but was too scared you're I'm like
that all you know if I ever promise
remind poor like and see I mean you guys
is the best thing the interaction
support that you guys give us I'm
talking about fuzzier yeah it's gonna
see it's unbelievable and I love
interacting with you guys that are
applying to the comments or something
yeah so never say maybe the viewers that
grieving just of you is actually other
YouTube's we meet like we met yeah we've
never usually
which is amazing so yeah that's all my
favorite things and I would say the one
thing that I dislike about YouTube is
how two different things
okay firstly being how much you get
judged for every little thing you do
later G because I was a daily
channel I heard in my life a whole day
people have such an opinion on it which
it doesn't really bother me but it's
just like you don't get it you know it's
like I would never hit on somebody I was
like that's what they love to do them
they're gonna be you know like definite
everybody has their own opinion but
sometimes you can just keep it to
yourself yeah you're definitely one
thing I don't like and also I don't like
when somebody acts on YouTube so
different to how I act in real life yes
I just found out and people watch them
and they're like they're this amazing
person it's like if you knew not really
yep what they were like there's so many
people or youtubers I've met they're so
different
yeah and it's such a disappointment like
she saw us like when you watch somebody
every day like you're bossing to eat
them yeah them and it's like that will I
let down as hell yeah love that you go
back and watch a video and you're like
you're nothing like that yeah it's so
it's so annoying and I've been this
morning so it's the end of our video I
really enjoyed it
my voice I don't know what's going on
with it make sure you go to stuff my
channel and check how many out that we
filmed over there again it will be
linked down below in the description box
yeah that's basically it I love you all
so much and I will see you next Sunday
