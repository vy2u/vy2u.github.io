today's video I am going to be doing
another clothing law I know I do so many
today's word I have basically it picked
out clothes that I see a lot of
Instagram models aware I know I thought
I would try and like put the outfits
together wear them myself realistically
see how wearable they actually are or if
people just do it for the photos because
admittedly sometimes I've seen something
and I'm like I just want to take a photo
in it like I don't think I could wear it
this stuff here is from boohoo and
pretty little thing so it's very
affordable a lot of the stuff I see
online is from places like that or it's
from like Zara
it's from well some people can go extra
out there and go with like the Gucci at
the ballet and you know but look over
our price tag so I've gone over the
affordable high street shops to show you
guys some Instagram bubble clothes and I
really like them I haven't actually
tried any of these on yet so I'm
basically just new doing my first
impressions on them and then obviously
this is a try on haul as well I hope you
guys enjoy and let's just get started so
the first outfit I decided to get was
something that I've seen a lot of people
wear not necessarily this pattern but in
a lot of people wear this style of top
and a lot of people wear these like
bando kind of crop tops type thing and I
really wanted to get one so I've got a
pretty little thing and this is a a
snake print one I've seen quite a few
people wear this now aren't really going
to animal prints normally personally
like the cheetah print and like those
type of prints just aren't for me I
really don't like them so then I kind of
saw this and like you know when you see
something out of the ordinary and you
think I like that that's kind of what
happened with this it was really
inexpensive as well it was either six or
eight pounds it's basically just a
snakeskin bandeau top and I really
really like this now I do struggle
wearing bando tops just because I do
have one bigger boob so it can kind of
look strange and most people do actually
wear these without a bra I think I'll be
wearing one with a bra and I'll just use
a strapless bra but I really like it
actually and I think it will look quite
nice on this is the top when I've got it
on I really really like it as you can
probably see I do have one bigger boob
and I
think it would be that no to support if
I wore it with a bra it's still
noticeable so I guess I just need to
find the right bra for it but you know
what embrace what you've got I think
it's a really nice top though it fits
you really nicely the pattern is printed
it really really nice it doesn't look
cheap at all and I think it looks really
good with this what I'm wearing as well
I do feel very supported in it obviously
I've got a bra on so you don't have to
wear it with a bra but I just see so
many people wear these on Instagram and
they look amazing and I wish I could
really really really pull them off so
I'm gonna give this a thumbs up and yeah
I can actually see how people wear this
on Instagram because it's really comfy
and if I could find the right bra to
wear it with so my boobs don't look
lopsided I'm definitely gonna wear it
and to go with this I've seen loads of
people wear these as well I got a basic
black midi skirt and out again you would
never catch me in a skirt I just don't
know if they suit me I don't know how
comfortable I fear them to be honest
like there's a lot of quotes I'd love to
wear but I go for comfort more over than
fashion I much prefer to feel really
cozy in my trousers then go out in a
skirt but I don't feel comfortable in
but I really want to kind of like
broaden my horizons and try new clothes
so we've got this black miniskirt this
was either 8 or 12 pounds although I
think it might have been 8 pounds and
there's not really much I can say about
this until I try it on really it's just
a long black tight skirt we might have
the issue with it being see-through yeah
I think it might be a little bit
see-through I also forgot to mention
this top was from pretty little thing
and so was the bando top so this how it
was a pretty little thing and in total
cost no more than 15 pounds and I
actually think it'd be really nice
outfit but I've got it on my head is
gonna be a little bit chopped off so I
do apologize but I've got on it the
skirt and again I love this I think it
looks really nice with that outfit it's
very flattering all the way around it's
not actually that see-through it's a
little bit see-through but it's a lot of
that see-through and it just goes and
you know like just below my knee I'll
put in a shot so you guys can see that
but it's really comfy for 8 pounds I
really don't think you can complain and
I really want to get one in more colors
again I can easily see how people wear
this on Instagram because it's so comfy
you can move in it you can do whatever
you want in it you know I mean basically
it's a really nice purchase and I
thought you couldn't wear a lot with
this and you can style it in many
different ways you can dress it down
with trainers but you can dress it up
with heels and you can wear it in the
day and the evening so basically you can
loads of different things so 100% this
is getting a hit from me and I would
definitely recommend it the next thing
that I've got I saw so many called I
think her name is Alyssa Roddy or Lizzie
Lizzie I'm not sure how you pronounce it
but I literally fell in love with her
Instagram as soon as I saw her and her
outfits are just incredible you guys
need to check her out and she had this
shirt on from boohoo but she wears it in
so many different ways and I've seen a
lot of people style this shirt as well
it's been on boohoo for ages and it's
just kind of like one of those things
that if you wouldn't like dig deep into
boohoo you wouldn't find it it's this
ripped shirt but it's like a thick
ripped and it's really nice it's got
pockets here it's really long and then
the edging it's all like rough and
hemmed which I really like and the Jesus
in several different colors but I got
mine in the creamy color because that's
what she had it in and she's worn as a
dress she's worn it as a jacket she's
worn it like with cycle shorts I think
it looks so cool and I've seen a lot of
people style it this was 22 pounds which
personally I don't think it's that bad
considering you can wear it and storing
it in so many different ways and people
wouldn't necessarily think it's the same
thing for instance if you wore it as a
dress and then the next day whereas a
jacket people would probably think it's
a different item of clothing so it's
really versatile and I'll definitely get
lots of wear out of this and by the way
it - 1/8 size smaller or it's a 6 yeah
right - 6 and it's very long either I
would go a size down or I would go just
your size it definitely would not go a
size up because my thinking was if I
want to wear it as a jacket do I go one
size up but then actually says on here
oversized for this show I actually
definitely prefer wearing it as a jacket
over a dress I thought that I might
prefer wearing it as a dress but no I
think a jacket is definitely the best
option it looks really good when you're
hanging it off your shoulders and I like
the ribbed effect of it and again it
looks really nice with this t-shirt as
well I feel like if I wore it as a dress
personally for me it would make me look
a little bit too boxy and then you just
look like straight you I mean like it
just wouldn't suit me but wearing it as
a jacket I think it looks really nice
and then I can obviously just put it up
on my shoulders and then again it just
it's like a normal oversized shirt I
like the edging of it a lot I like how
it's really rough it's really like just
basically the loose seams and I think
it's a really nice shirt actually so
again I really like what the closing
this all I've got 100 percent see over
22 pounds you get this shirt because
it's very versatile and
some people it will suit them as wearing
it as a dress as well and just as a
normal shirt so definitely recommend
this I really like this top I've seen it
so many people wearing it on Instagram
and it's so inexpensive it's ten pounds
and it's just a white top but they also
do it in black and it's just got writing
on it that says weekend tees Beverly
Hills estate 2012 and I thought this was
a really nice top I love my slogan tops
I wear them all the time
I have so many in my wardrobe already
the perfect thing is as oh I got this in
a size medium so I can wear it is a
t-shirt and tuck it in but it's actually
long enough for me to be able to wear as
a dress as well so again I feel like
I've killed two birds with one stone
here and I can get two different outfits
out of this
I actually prefer wearing it as a dress
over a t-shirt because I did get mine in
a size medium which I presumed would be
a better because I thought yeah it'll be
oversized but it's actually an oversized
t-shirt anyway so I definitely would
have been finally getting a small
because I'm only 5 foot 5 inch I prefer
wearing it as a dress because it comes
up as the perfect length for me as a
t-shirt dress and normally t-shirt
dresses when I actually order them as a
dress from the dress section a too boxy
but because this is an actual teacher it
just flows and it look so nice
also a how cool does it look with these
sunglasses I'm like ok now I feel like
an Instagram model I think it's really
really nice it's really comfy as I said
what is just a t-shirt basically feel
like I'm about to go to bed so it's
really really nice I love this so much
and a home to present I can see why
those of people have this on Instagram
and the other thing that I got is that
so much trousers and again I've seen a
lot of people kind of rock the Pinstripe
look and I wanted to get on that trend
you know I like the pinstripes so I got
these gray at pin striped trousers and
these were pretty little thing they were
20 pounds now my name in a size 6 but
when I tried them on I feel like they
would bit too big for me that's never
happened to me before normally size 6 is
perfect to me but these are quite big
unless stretchy personally I would go a
size down as well because the legs are
actually very baggy I had the impression
from the website that they were going to
be super tight fitting on my leg which I
was really looking forward to and then
you can kind of like roll them up at the
bottom and it will look really
sophisticated or you can roll down
we call and then when it arrived and I
first of all like looked at them also
wow if here these are a little bit big
and then I did so obviously I'm still
gonna wear them and stuff because I do
like them but I just definitely go a
size down to what you usually are I've
got on my top which is some pretty
little thing I've got on my trousers
again we're talking pretty little thing
and I've also got my blazer from I saw
at first and we are now gonna head to
the Game of Thrones event so let's go
she looks insane we are on our way to e
Game of Thrones what is it exactly
so it's know you might know me the
leaving some of those successful
programs on television next I got these
two tops which again I've seen so at
many people we're an Instagram I've seen
this emoji where I've seen a fashion
influx where I've seen lots of people
wear them and these are boohoo and like
I said I never not only shuffled boohoo
but just it took my heart this time
there just isn't it all like a square
neck Finn's trapped crop tops and
they've just got this repeating pattern
of what it looks like aw yeah he's
actually aw I was gonna say it's a V but
notice the W and it's just why I really
really like this I think it's really
nice it's the perfect size for me and
I've got mine in a size 6 and if it's
over my boobs perfectly and yeah I
really do like this I really am getting
into the square crop top small I used to
be like no I need to wear thick sleeves
on my crop tops but I'm getting into
this a lot more and it's a little bit
higher and then it goes a little bit
lower at the back as you can see and
this was only six pounds and then to go
with it I actually got the reversible
body suit I'm saying reversible I mean
like reversible colors because this time
it's black with the white color on it
but again exactly the same pattern this
time this is a bodysuit so I'll probably
just wear this with like jeans or cycle
shorts and maybe like the shirt thing
that I bought I thought this is really
nice and this one was either 10 or 12
pounds or maybe it was even eight pounds
I thought like it actually worth eight
pounds because everybody liked this I
thought it was really nice it is a
little bit see-through but then I
haven't wore the black one yet so when
you hold it up into the light yeah I
don't know maybe I just need to wear a
black bra with it I've decided to try on
the bodysuit over the crop top as I have
actually already tried on the crop top
and it fits me perfectly it's basically
exactly the same as this just without
the bodysuit part so I thought I've
shown on the bodysuit one and it's so so
comfy and because it's a bodysuit
I can wear it with this skirt and you
won't notice that I might have a visible
pant line because obviously it's the
bunny suit so this is really comfy
though obviously I have got a bra wrong
with it and it's a really tight bra so I
probably wouldn't wear a bra with this
top I'd probably go without a bra or
maybe just get some sort of brown there
because obviously you can't see the
straps because it's a square net crop
top and I don't really like when you can
see the straps I think it kind
a bit weird so I've only just kept a bra
on for the purpose of this video so you
don't see my nipple a hundred percent
this is get out of here and I can
definitely see why a lot of people need
to grab have this because it's so comfy
and I really do like it so actually even
though I never used to shop on boohoo
I'm definitely gonna start to go there
more often because their stuff is good
and then maybe in a little bit extra I
got some sunglasses that I thought were
really really cool I've seen loads of
people wear them and I like I says we're
not cool enough to pull them off but
you're gonna borrow them anyway these
are ridiculously extra and I don't know
if I'd wear them like all the time when
I'm out I've more wear them just for a
fashion statement but they're these and
they were ten pounds which I do feel
like was a little bit expensive for what
they are but they're these really thin
framed sunglasses and they kind of just
sit on the edge of your nose like that
so I mean don't get me wrong they look
cool but they're definitely not going to
block out the Sun apart from the labels
it's really killing the vibe I do really
like these and I think in like again
like a photo I actually like Instagram
bar in a photo these would look really
good
and I actually do really like them
obviously they've got UV protection but
when you push them right up onto your
eyes are they literally look quite fat
and they won't go on because of my
eyelashes see ya I mean I really like
them I think they're really nice and I
actually will wear these I'm going to
pop them on my little grid back there on
my dressing table and I'm excited
talking to the collection yeah oh God
and then I actually decided to get
another few thing for pretty little
thing and these are the last two things
that I've got so the first thing is a
skirt because again never somebody wears
skirts but really like to get into some
more so this is a gray pinstripe tie
waist
me skirt and it's this exactly the same
gray pinstripe as the other one and then
it's just like a tight mini skirt like
you said and then it's just got the
little tie bits here which you could tie
into a bow at the front and I'm actually
planning on wearing this to the
blogosphere Awards because I am up for
best vlogger so if I win oh but yeah I'm
really excited to wear this out I think
it's a really nice skirt actually and
yeah actually like this and now I've got
the skirt on and again I love this so
much it's just a gray pinstripe it's
really flattering because it goes at
tight around this area I thought it was
gonna be a bit like a pencil skirt and
just kind of go straight and then
obviously you've got this little bit
which you could tie into a bow here you
don't have to wear the belt as well
you can take out and you could put any
belt in that you want which i think is
really nice because how good with this
look with the Gucci belt but it's really
like a shape hugging as well it's really
nice it kind of shows off your figure
and I got mine in a size six which is my
normal size so I just get you normal
size for this it does fit me perfect
lengthwise as well and it doesn't rise
up when I'm walking which is nice I
thought that everyone might slide up on
my legs and then kind of like end up
showing everything but what I'm walking
it just stays in the same place which I
love like I said I'm just never normally
a skirt girl but I can 100% see where
people want to wear skirts because I for
sure I'm gonna be invested in like
Lowe's wool skirts I love them and then
to wear with that I've got something
that I've seen so many people wear on
Instagram and it's like a petite stone a
high-neck curved hem jump up when I
order this I have the impression it was
gonna be really thick and it's not and
I'm so happy I can see it's actually
like a thick jumper I see so many people
wear these if you layered necklaces even
in the summer weave cycle shorts I think
it looks so cool also I keep talking
about cycle shorts but I haven't
actually bought any it's because I have
some in my wardrobe already else believe
me they would be all over this home so
this is the if jumper it's really really
nice it's got like the curved hem this
is the front so it like curls down and
then the back is just straight it's just
the stone type cone it's got a high neck
here and I think this will look really
nice with the skirt actually so I'm very
excited to try this on I like that one
that's quite small but then I guess that
would mean it'd be very tight fitting
this jumper is actually gonna be one of
my favorite jumpers because it's really
thin it's not thick at all and I love
this little like curvy hem bit obviously
up with it tucked in but it's just like
a hem that kind of goes low and in the
back actually goes higher so it's really
really comfy
so what many people wear jumpers like
this I'm like where have you got that
from and finally I found one I do
actually have a thick version of this
but sometimes it can get too thick and
obviously in the summer and stuff
British um is very unpredictable so
having a thin jumper is always a kind of
good option but it's so comfy I love the
neck as well I've just rolled it down a
little bit because it does come up quite
high on me but again I can see why so
many people like to wear these jumpers
because they're so comfy
not gonna lie I'm really hot but maybe
that's because I've got that much to do
like blinding on me but yeah I am very
hot but maybe on a muggy day like it is
today if you go outside the sun's not
really out and
would be perfect for summer maybe going
into autumn we've just opened the little
like booklets that we've been given on
our table when it has the Baba's bear
Awards 2018 and then this is the page
that I've been nominated on and these
are all the people in my category and
it's not about role duty-free which is
so cool that is the end of this video I
really hope you guys have enjoyed seeing
me do another clothing haul I know I do
so at many clothing hauls but I have a
bit of an obsession with clothes I
thought it would be really helpful
though because I know so many people go
on Instagram they see loads of clothes
the person never tags what they're
wearing and where it's from so I just
thought I would find some really cool
items I thought you guys might like and
I'm gonna leave all the links down below
so you can go and buy them if you want
to and I really like them and you
definitely will be seeing a lot over my
Instagram so just plug in we're
Instagram but thank you so much for
watching I really hope you guys have
enjoyed if you did please smash it a
huge thumbs up let's see if we can smash
10,000 likes on this video and other
than that I will see you on Wednesday at
6 p.m. a favor a new one bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
