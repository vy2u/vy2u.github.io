back and I'm doing testing Instagram
beauty hacks before I get into the video
I just want to say I am so ill right now
I kind of felt ill when I woke up this
morning and it just got worse and worse
I was like the days gone on and I know
I'm gonna be sorry off for a while and
I'm gonna lose my voice so I decided to
film even though extend them right now
on my new video Nick she went up like
four hours ago
so I'm pre filming for when you're
seeing this because I feel so well and I
just but there's no one ever missing an
upload for you guys so even when I do
feel like crap I'm still filming so
today I'm going to be testing out some
very very very weird beauty hacks that
I've seen on Instagram I have five I
would do more but I just would - oh so
obviously that's not five today I have
never tried any of these five that I'm
going to be doing some of them so random
honest like the most randomest things
ever I've never seen anybody do one of
them that I'm doing and I just think
it's so weird like I don't know I don't
think any of these are going to work if
they do amazing but I didn't realize it
now but yeah without further ado I'm
gonna get straight into the video so
yeah I hope you enjoy what so the first
Beauty hack I found on Instagram was how
to make your lips look bigger now I
don't really need this because as you
can see my bottom lip is so big anyway I
really like my lips I like having big
lips but people ask me like if I've had
lit fillers and stuff I haven't these
are just my natural lips and my bottom
lip is a lot bigger naturally than my
top lip but there's a beauty how to go
around at the moment on how to get
bigger lips and it's if you draw lines
on your lips
they'll look bigger and plumper so we're
just gonna try out so I have my phone
here and I'm using the Gerard cosmetics
lip pencil in the shade
sure now as you can see it's such a
gorgeous color it's a bit darker to what
I have on today this is a jar cosmetics
liquid lipstick as well I'll leave the
shade in the description box I think
it's like bear something a common buff
but yeah I'm just gonna start drawing
the lines on
now to me that looks so stupid that
looks like I'm about to go to a
Halloween party and Audrey likes
stitches on my mouth like that does not
look like my lips any bigger this would
probably work better on people that has
smaller lips but if I blend a bit more
donuts are bigger although just a really
stupid I can tell I think we're gonna
get this one it doesn't work the next
one is using fire on foundation now I'm
super excited for this one just because
I've seen a few people try it out and
I'm so excited to try out myself so what
you do is you put your foundation on a
spoon or anything like that you heat it
up underneath like this and then you
just put it onto your face and blend it
so I'm going to start off by wiping off
a bit of my foundation and I'm not going
to wipe it all off because it took me so
long to do a makeup this morning I felt
so ill so I'm just gonna wipe this bit
off here
Patrick my foundations off so then I'm
taking my favorite foundation which is
the lorry Oh too much I'm just going to
pop tiny tiny bit on the spoon don't
know if you can see that probably want
to work that if I had a tea spoon but I
don't want to use much of it because I'm
not covering that much of my face
so that's on there and then we're just
gonna heat it up I guess now I don't
know how long you're meant to heat this
up forth but it looks like it's like
expanding does it feel hot ah oh my god
okay do you not eat it up for long
because that is boiling whoa thank God I
touched it because the foundation is
boiling now oh my gosh the foundation is
so hot okay okay look over how hot this
is so as you can see there's a load of
hot foundation on my face right now
it really hurts so I'm gonna start to
blend it I mean personally it feels you
know that never happens
it feels so sticky I'm giving that a no
do not heat your foundation piece in
your foundation with fire does not make
your makeup look flawless and why do you
for the first five minutes then it will
come off all over your hands
the next weird and crazy life hack is
using hand sanitizer as a primer this is
a recent one that I've seen and I don't
think it's gonna work but we're going to
try it so we're going to wipe the other
cheeks foundation off just down here
okay Foundation is off then this is just
the bath and Bodyworks ice cream dream
and sanitizers oh well this is good oh
this is disgusting
kay I put all my fingers I'm just gonna
blend it on my face I cannot even
describe to you how sticky my face feels
now to test that out I am going to be
using another lie pack and that is to
blend your foundation with a sock so
we're gonna get some more foundation and
I'm just gonna blend it where they sock
which is gonna go wrong I can already
see it got a bit more foundation this
all over my cheek this is disgusting
it's a clean sock but I mean I don't
know what's going on but it's just not
like it's just not sticking like that I
don't know if it's gonna last I will
keep you updated on my social media if
it does work but guy it's like that's
disgusting I don't know where half these
people come up with these beauty hacks
for an Instagram because let's be real
half of them like you've seen them work
on some people and you're like oh my god
how do you do that and you try it out
yourself and you're like that doesn't
work so there are all the beauty hacks I
have for you today I'm restoring this as
such kind of a short video there wasn't
really much going on it's just because I
genuinely feel so ill and I just don't
have the energy but I just didn't want
to miss an upload so make sure you go
and show your support down there in the
comments because literally I need your
guy's support right now but yet other
than that I really hope you enjoyed this
video if you did give it a huge thumbs
up make sure you go and watch last
weekend - uploads I uploaded on Saturday
and Sunday so I think you should go
check it out you get other than that I
really hope you enjoyed the video and I
will see you in next week's bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
