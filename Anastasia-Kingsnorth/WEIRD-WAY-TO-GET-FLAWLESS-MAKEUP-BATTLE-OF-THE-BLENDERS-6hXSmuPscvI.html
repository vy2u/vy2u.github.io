am back for a little extra upload and
today I'm going to doing a really simple
way on how to get flawless makeup now as
you can see I'm very close to the camera
and that is because I'm going to be
testing and reviewing the brand new moly
cosmetics
silly sponge so I was lucky enough to
receive this in YPO box and I'm so
grateful because I wanted this sponge
ever since I saw Jeffrey's I'd do a
video on it and as soon as I opened it
yesterday my Pierre box I knew that I
have to do a video and get it up as soon
as possible for you guys so today I'm
going to be reviewing this and putting
it up to the test against a real Beauty
Blender and brushes I want to show you
guys the best way to get flawless makeup
and I don't know whether this is going
to be it or not so I'm going to tell you
whether this is worth to rave or not
today and I'm super excited also yes I'm
very close to the camera because I need
to show you guys how it looks so I'm
very sorry for being this close you can
see all my spots that I have at the
moment but we'll get past that so if
this is the packaging I receive this in
my PA box with metics which is an app
and it just says silly sponge
exclusively in the UK and now so I'm
just going to open it just comes in this
little silver packaging so guess we just
open it like this and then just pop it
open this is so exciting I love the
packaging on it for one okay wow that
feels so much different to what I
thought so it comes in this little
packaging I don't think there's anything
else in here is that you know it's just
an instructions on the back if we take
out the packaging it feels is so strange
like wow I cannot imagine my makeup
looking good with this like Geoffrey
Stars up to okay but like it just feels
very strange to put your makeup on with
something like this it's a lot thicker
than I thought I definitely thought it's
going to be a lot thinner and it's quite
bendy as well it goes back to its
original shape quite easily and it is
very soft it's made of silicone but I
know it feels very strange and I've seen
people compare it to a bra ring sir I've
never held a browser plus I don't know
but I don't know it seems weird so I'm
going to put this up to the test I'm
going to use one side
my foundation with this on one side of
my foundation with a Beautyblender
slash brush so you guys can see which is
the best way to get flawless makeup I'm
going to go in closer now so I'm let's
get stuff so I'm a lot closer now and
today I'm going to be using the Too
Faced Born This Way Foundation while
L'Oreal true match foundation which is
my Holy Grail ran out this morning so I
cannot use that but I will use a
different foundation on my other side
but today I'm going to using the Born
This Way on this side I'm just going to
pop it here on my skin just in these
different motions and we're just going
to see how the blender the silicone
blender works I would do it all over my
face but I'm going out today so I
literally can but I'm just going to give
my best opinions to you on this part so
here is the sponge it is all ready to
use as you can see I already have some
fingerprints on it so the makeup
literally is sticks on it and slides off
it's so weird I don't know how well I
like this already but let's just get
blending
okay first impressions it is picked up
so much product for me too much product
can you guys hear that noise that noise
is so unattractive and look it's not
even going on my face I don't think
okay so now I've been blending it a bit
more I can definitely see that is a
solid coverage coming through please
ignore that I have a spot down there
it feels very smooth I make it feels
very very airbrushed and then this side
where I do have foundation on it doesn't
feel as smooth I can't explain it but
this side feels amazing okay grant Elia
has picked up so much foundation but I
guess that's because it's the first time
I've used it but I really like this
guess if you're trying to put foundation
around here it would be a lot harder
because you're trying to get in the
nooks and crannies of your face but as
you can see it's given me a lot more
coverage like on my foundation which I
really like now I've done this side I'm
going to do this side using a Beauty
Blender slash brush just to show you
guys a comparison and see what you think
is best so again I'm just going to use
the Born This Way again just so you guys
can see evenly I'm just going to pop
this all on my face and I'm going to
blend the chin with a splash and the
side of the beauty blender to me the
brush again is picking up a lot of
product but maybe that's just the peel I
haven't used it before this brush mousse
is freshly washed so I don't really use
this brush much I mean it doesn't feel
as smooth to me this feels so airbrush I
can't get over it
but then this just feels kind of sticky
like okay that's a perfect example and
look at my finger and then when I touch
that nothing now let's go in with my
Holy Grail Beauty Blender this is a
proper Beauty Blender I got this from
Sephora and I love it
so that is that blended and to be fair
they feel very very similar but this
side is still picking up residue and
this side is not I feel like that
silicone sponge really blended it in to
my face which is very different really
because I don't think it would so these
are the two we battled out today and not
going to lie guys I think this one is
one don't get me wrong I will never stop
using my Beauty Blender because I
literally swear by this but this sponge
is actually amazing I don't know how
well I'd use it around the nooks and
crannies of my face because that could
be a bit difficult and I probably use
this still but I'm definitely going to
start using this on an everyday basis so
I hope you guys enjoyed this video let
me know if you did by giving a huge
thumbs up the reason I didn't do my
whole face is because I have to go out
literally as soon as I press stop on
this camera but hopefully you can see
from this area of my face as this is the
clearest part as well how well this fun
works but I would definitely say I love
the sponge and the silh sponge so I'm
probably going to use both because
genuinely these are incredible thank you
so much metics for sending this out to
me I am super obsessed with it make sure
to come back tomorrow at 10 a.m. but for
a brand new video I'm super excited for
this video I have everything surrounding
me right now I don't know you guys are
going to love it so I will see you
tomorrow with a brand new video I really
hope you enjoyed such a huge thumbs up
if you did and that is how to get
flawless makeup I love it all so much
and I will see you tomorrow for a brand
new video I love you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
