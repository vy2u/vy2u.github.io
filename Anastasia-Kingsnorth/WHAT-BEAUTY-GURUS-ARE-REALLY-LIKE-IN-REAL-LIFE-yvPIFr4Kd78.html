back and I am going to be doing exposing
a YouTube beauty gurus now this isn't
going to be a summer type of slating
video where isolate specific youtubers
for things that I don't agree with or
things that I don't like I'm not like
that at all this is going to be a bit of
a comedy video showing you guys what
YouTube beauty gurus I really like off
of camera now beauty gurus have this
persona that all the time their life is
perfect and everything goes right and
they don't have any problems or making a
video is easy and things like that and
it's just not like it just doesn't go
how you guys probably think and there
are so many things that go wrong and I
just feel like I should show you guys
just so you can kind of see more of what
goes into making a video and more of
what happens behind the scenes I'm not
saying every YouTube beauty guru does
this a probably don't these are just
things I've all experienced at some
point in my youtube career and I just
thought I'd make a comedy video out of
it because why not
plus I've never seen anybody do this
video before so we have an original
video idea guys yes but yet that is
basically it so I really hope you enjoy
the video and let's get up
know what snapchat is not always easy
for beauty gurus sometimes we just sit
there and you want to tell a message to
you guys we wanted to say an
announcement or anything like that and
as you know you can only record videos
for 10 seconds on snapchat and sometimes
that is just not long enough and we can
get very annoyed and then you guys don't
even find out what way to tell you
because it's 10 seconds and you have to
keep filming videos and keep doing
videos to do an announcement and then
you just doesn't get done hey guys so I
have a brand new video out if you
haven't seen it already it is a huge
makeup haul and by the way it is
actually gonna be a huge giveaway next
week but all you guys have seen it
already
hey guys so I have a brand new video out
it is Oh God
hey guys I have a brand new video out it
is a huge shopping haul majors are going
to check it out um what time hey guys I
have a brand new video out it is a huge
shopping haul loaded a huge splurge on
makeup clothes and by the way there's
actually going to be a huge giveaway so
just gonna go for a picture
number two as you know we all have
Instagram love a bit of Instagram post
photos on their post different makeup
tips everything like that you can show
people I don't know your face of the day
but I am guilty of this editing my
photos I know a lot of YouTube beauty
gurus edit their photos and you know
sometimes you just do it it makes you
look better it makes you feel better I
don't mean drastically edit the photos
but I mean you know blurring a few bits
here and there and just wiping the
background which yes I do
and just making it look a bit more you
know seem appropriate and it matches
your your feed
well we are just applying mass contrast
exposure turn that all night turn that
halfway up saturation I look pale warmth
turn alternate I'm gonna fit all the
blue tone today vibrant to turn that
down
okay apply it and blur tool alert this
background out get it the way allgemeine
the hair Oh Blair it keep blaring it
just makes this help you stand out a bit
more you know okay yeah feelin that and
then whiten wears whiten or we've got a
wide to the background but I make it a
little bit more brighter just too much
the same a perfect
number three the next one I'm pretty
sure every beauty guru has done this at
some point in their time on YouTube and
it is wearing pajama bottoms when
forming the videos we look very
presentable from here upwards you know
we do our hair do our makeup we get a
nice top line got a bit of choker then
from Lowe's we are either naked in
pajama bottoms or wearing bottoms that
completely do not match our outfit
because you guys don't have to see that
and we just like to be comfy so uh yeah
next time you're watching a video on
YouTube just thank god they're probably
wearing pajamas the ring light my god is
it hot in here
Oh hmm
hi everyone so for today's video number
4 the next one I don't know how many
youtubers would have experienced this
but I definitely experienced it a lot
and it used to drive me and my mom and
dad every time I upload a video in the
house my whole Wi-Fi connection for
every other device will just cut off I
couldn't use Instagram snapchat Twitter
YouTube I couldn't go on the internet it
would just shut off for hours or video
uploads and along with the video it's a
longer time it took to upload and also
stop the TV so you can't tell my mom as
impressed as I said don't know how many
other youtubers suffer with that but I
tell you what that is the one thing that
I absolutely hated but now is sorted
because I have unlimited internet on my
phone so you know I guess I'll talk to
you guys but that was a problem thank
God videos uploading now to sit and
check social media gosh
one Instagram load please
twizz mother would go watch TV
the wife is also cut off number five the
next one is so annoying and I know that
pretty much every youtuber beauty guru
or non beauty guru would have also
experienced this filming a video with no
noise or is out of focus now behind the
scenes we will sit there for be able to
sit with the overhaul a makeup tutorial
is the most annoying and we sit and film
them and then we just you know you watch
back the footage and we look at
ourselves me like wow we're out of focus
and let me just try and turn the volume
up we're like wow I can't hear myself is
honestly devastating and it's the worst
thing and it always happens to the
videos that you love the most
so I started filmed a haul for a few
weeks ago and he never went up because I
was out of focus
and it was driving me insane and I know
that this happens to so many people and
even if it's just the tiniest bit out of
focus it will drive you insane
yeah beauty guru suffer from that
problem hey everyone so for today's
video I am back and I'm really doing an
absolutely huge makeup haul edit my
videos no I'll focus full video mic
number six now a problem that a lot of
people experience just as well as beauty
gurus is our makeup going wrong now we
may look like we have our act together
and our makeup looks pretty decent on
camera but really leading up to that we
we experience some dilemmas like today
I'd like to think my makeup looks pretty
presentable whereas actually my eyeliner
was running down my eye and I couldn't
get my eyelash on in reality but you
guys don't see that you never know that
you just see it as we can do our makeup
but I tell you what it's not like that
beauty gurus are very good at makeup and
let's be fair that's why they're called
beauty gurus but we have some trip ups
we have some problems and it doesn't
always go how we want it to so please
never feel alone with that because we
are just like normal people and I'll
make up we have bad makeup days
success
number seven now I take this on for last
because I feel like this is probably the
most savage one out of them all and I
feel like a lot of youtubers are guilty
of this and sadly I know I'm guilty of
it just because I can't justify it but
it's saying you're going to reply to
comment and you don't now some people
say this to keep their followers active
or some people say this just to see all
the different comments and they say okay
I'm going to sit in reply to them and
they still reply to a few and then they
just go off and do their own thing I
have done it in the past and I really
really regret it because I love talking
to you guys and I hate it if I say I'm
going to reply to comment and then I
don't so I always do try to reply to
comments
I don't reply to every comment because I
do get thousands but I reply to as many
as I can but I know and I have seen a
few people guilty of this one and they
say they're going to sit there for hours
and reply to comments and they don't we
can't justify it it's something that I
think a lot of people are guilty of
whether it's good or not and I apologize
if I've done it in the past but that's
what some beauty gurus do how savage to
employ some comments for an hour on
today's video Oh everybody's being so
lovely Oh everybody just loves articles
I'm so happy maybe you'll put post on
Instagram saying don't film a video with
him okay all 700 points reply to okay
yep do that
thank you it oh and we've been so lovely
I'm so happy video is that well oh I'm
going to get some food and then come
back and finish your quieter oh yeah oh
oh oh
new Jeffrey's our upload oh my god yes
oh man EMU a collapse oh my god okay
Oh watch this not hurry up oh that is
the end of my exposing YouTube beauty
gurus video I really really really hope
you enjoyed it
I loved filming this video skips are
some of my favorite videos to film I
find them so funny and this one I feel
like you guys can get to know me a bit
more but maybe look at your other
favorite YouTube beauty gurus and think
