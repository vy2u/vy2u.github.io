and I do doing my what I got for
Christmas 2016 video
Merry Christmas it is currently
Christmas Day and the exact time is 1003
and I have just finished opening my
presents and I have a few hours to spare
so I thought I would sit down and film
and what I got for Christmas for you all
and then put it up on Christmas Day so
just a quick disclaimer I know how lucky
I am to have received all of this stuff
today I'm extremely extremely grateful
for all of it and I know that I have
been spoiled I guess because there is a
lot here but I'm super grateful for all
of it and I'm going to use all of it so
much so in this video I'm only going to
show you presents for my mum my dad and
my nan because I did get so much and I
don't want this video to be overly long
so make sure you go and add my snapchat
which will be in description box down
below as I'm going to be channeling my
brother got me my sister got me who else
my uncle my friends everything like that
so yeah without further ado I'm just
going to get started
oh by the way please mind the jumper it
is Christmas Day so I didn't really want
to get ready so you're dealing with this
the main present I got off my mum I was
not expecting at all it was the last
thing I expected I admittedly did ask
for it but I definitely didn't think my
mum would get it because it is so
expensive and it's an iPad Mini I don't
know if you guys know but I actually
edit all of my videos on my iPad and I
have a really old iPad now it was one of
the first ones out and it's been so slow
because I added on it I really into the
new one and my mum actually got me the
iPad Mini for 32 gigabyte in gold this
is the eye side but the thing that made
it so special to me is on the back it
has fleur princess engraved and this
means so much to me because YouTube is
my life and usually with everything that
I do and it's just amazing that I had it
engraved on my iPad because this is
where all of the videos are made like on
this little iPad here it's insane but
I'm so so so grateful for this so I
cannot wait to set this up later and
just have a play around with it so yeah
I'm super excited for so thank you so
much mum so then obviously that was a
huge man presence so I didn't expect
anything else big at all and then there
was an absolutely huge box and I opened
it
she could offer me but what I was seeing
but my mama got me a ring light I have
wanted a ring light for the longest time
and I was planning on buying one anyway
because my studio lighting that I use is
practically on its way out and then mum
was like you know I got you one because
I know how much you wanted one and so
just like this and I'm super excited to
play around with this I'm filming with
this studio light for the next few
videos and then this would be in use so
I'm super excited to see the quality
improve my videos with this and yeah I'm
so excited if I can actually take some
banging selfies now and to go with that
my mum got me the stand and a little
adapter where's the adapter the adapters
in here you needed like something to
attach it to the stand and then I have
this absolutely huge lightbox stand here
so thank you so much mom I'm so excited
to set that up and have a play around
with it so even though I mom got me
alone with the stuff I'm just going to
quickly go into what my dad got me
because it's all so tech related so I
thought I just get all about the tech
stuff out of the way firstly my dad got
me with a camera bag I asked one of
these because my camera is kind of just
left laying underneath my bed and I
really needed a camera bag so this one
fits my camera perfectly I have the
Canon EOS 700d
so absolutely super dropped it if I just
put my camera in it and then my dad also
got me a microphone this is the KNF
concept recording microphone and I'm
super excited for this literally I
wanted a microphone for so long as well
because I just want to make the best
quality videos I can for you guys so it
comes in here like this in a little box
and I'm super excited to put this
together I can you tell I'm super
excited but if it's because I am so I'm
gonna try this on my camera today and
just have a bit of a play around with it
but yeah I absolutely love this so thank
you so much mom and dad for his main
presence I literally love them all now
moving on to the other things that my
mum got me so first of all I'm just
going to pick up what I can
she got me some lush so she got me candy
mountain and mistletoe bath bomb I
always have lush every Christmas it's
literally my favorite thing ever
candy mountain is so good but then
they're brand new mistletoe bar for me
is also really good so I'm going to have
a bath of these later my money then pick
me up something trims around a beauty
which I really are happy about because
genuinely so other stuff is incredible I
love it so I did ask for a big
a cutback so my mum got me this and she
was like I thought you could use the big
player as a makeup bag then the other
two a toiletry bag so these are these
are Wella we three beauties gift set and
it's really really cute so thank you my
love that and then she also got me these
available UT Gingerbread and vanilla
fragrance set which I'm really excited
about because I said to month I love
this perfume
ever since amber got me the mini set for
my birthday so she got me this set and I
just think it's really cute because the
Gingerbread scent is so strong like I
can smell it through the box yes so nice
so yeah I love that
now I'm also got me as a beauty Sweet
Inspirations perfume as well I wanted
this for so long and this was so good
literally I don't really wear that much
perfume I've never been really a perfume
person but since Zoey bought these out
I've absolutely adored them and I've
gone through both mini bottles of these
two scents so I'm super excited have the
big bottles and then out of nowhere guys
actually my mum came through I genuinely
cannot believe the stuff that she got me
from now on like oh my god that's all
she got me the real techniques of bold
metals collection Beauty Blender I'm in
love with this so excited to try it I
actually got one at beautycon but so now
I have to but I don't mind because you
always need more sponges so I got this
and then I can literally smell it and I
haven't even took the lid off yet my mum
got me a bath and Bodyworks candle which
mind-blown this one is in maple cinnamon
pancakes and it smells insane guys I
wish I could put the smell on the
screens and you could smell it like my
whole room is filled with it and it's
not even lit like you open it and you
can just smell it
I love the lid as well it has a little
Christmas tree on and it's just so
beautiful the little picture on the
front it's just so good literally I have
no idea where she got this wrong but I
think they do ship to the UK now don't
hold me on that they might I don't know
but yeah I literally love this so much
my baby she then got me some things from
Anastasia Beverly Hills which I am
shocked about because I have a few
things from Anastasia and the side or
whatever you want to call it I call it a
nostalgia because my name is Anastasia I
don't think it's that but yeah so she
got me two things so first of all she
got me the dick brow pomade in the shade
taupe and I'm so excited
try this as I know I've been filling in
my eyebrows and so many people rave
about the dip brow pomade so I just
decided to put it on my Christmas list
and I didn't think mom would actually
get me it but she did don't know where
she got it from but yes I'm super
excited to try this
literally eyebrows are done they're so
good and then literally we just need to
take a moment because she got me the
modern renaissance palette what I wanted
this for so long when I was in Paris
with all my YouTube friends Louise had
it and I went into Sephora jazz and we
wanted it so bad and now I have it
guys this is the most gorgeous palette
ever the this color here and this kind
of here is literally my good it's going
to be my life for the next few looks you
can see I love burgundy eyeshadows and
glitters so the fact that this has so
many nudes plus Burgundy's in makes this
the best palette ever and it's like
gorgeous and so soft so and then the
final things my mom got me are from
Kylie cosmetics and I'm super excited
that she got me a new Kandy K liquid
lipstick because my run out literally
the week before Christmas as you
actually got me a new one and then she
got me two lip kits so she got me one in
love right and one in Kourt K and I have
caught it on right now I mean literally
in love with them they're so beautiful
this is love bite and I genuinely like I
can I'm going to burn up oh my god I'm
literally speechless
do you also then got me a few little
bitch from my room and in some life
sweets and stuff but I'm not going to
show them I'm just going to train them
over on my snapchat and finally my Nana
actually got me something insane and
like God bless her soul she got me kaki
nmds I've wanted these for a while now
because amber showed the enemies I was
like god they're gorgeous and originally
I looked at like this salmony nude ones
but they're just out shop everywhere and
I told my mum that I was looking at
these and my mum told went down and
ordered them for me and just God bless
