today is a Christmas day welcome back to
our channel I am going to be doing a
what I got for Christmas 2017 how crazy
is it that it's already Christmas I feel
like this year has absolutely blown ABAI
and today is Christmas Day uploading
this on Christmas Day for you guys so
Merry Christmas I'm literally about to
have my mercenary like 20 minutes I'm
pretty buzzing no girl I also something
slightly different so if you've been
watching my vlogmas and my daily vlogs
which link down below you would know
that my shell fell down so I actually
have a slightly different background
because I had to go to Ikea my desk
because yes my shelf did fully fall down
it literally likes to quick story time I
was asleep about half 7:00 in the
morning fine
next thing you know show us on the floor
so there you go but today I'm redoing a
why I got for Christmas 2017 I'm
absolutely buzzing because this year was
one of the first years of what I didn't
know anything that I was getting
normally I kind of like know what my
name present is and I kind of know what
I'm gonna get but they shouldn't ask for
anything so literally everything was a
surprise and my family did so goods that
as per I'm definitely a hundred cent not
bragging I am just so so grateful and
Christmas isn't about the present but
you guys love seeing these videos so I
just wanted to do it anyway but in no
means am i bragging
I'm Jenny just showing you what I got
for Christmas and I'm so grateful so
yeah I think we should just get started
because I'm pretty button to show you
guys what I got so I hope you guys enjoy
the video and let's get started so
starting off with the main present that
my mum got me I had no idea that my mum
was gonna do this and she went above and
beyond to try and get this present for
me and she managed to get it it wasn't
bought outright it is on contract but
even to get the contract if she
literally went above and beyond and
basically my mum got me an iPhone X I am
still in shock because basically she
packaged it up in like a big gift bag
and then I had a little sack of presents
and basically she took one of the
presents out the sack and she was I know
you need to open this like with your
main one
and I kind of thought like this sheath
of an iPhone case but I was like and I
was like surely not
so I can open my present and then I
opened it and it was an iPhone case and
inside the big backer was an iPhone X
and I'm just literally like I can't
believe it so here is my new phone it's
so beautiful here is the case as well
it's from skinny-dip and it's mom said
it's like reminds her of like the Kylie
Jenner lip sticks and stuff which I was
like yesterday reminds me of that too
but she got me this 64 gigabyte silver
one but to me it looks like white with
silver detailing and yeah the case and
the camera and then here it is I've set
it all up earlier but I love it so much
like honestly the camera quality is out
of this world I've never seen anything
like it
I'm just so so so grateful because I've
had my phone for about a year but
obviously it could have lasted a little
longer so the fact that mum got me a
brand new phone and went above and
beyond to get it mean to absolute well
to me so thank you so much honesty like
I would never forget in the moment I
opened it I actually got my raw reaction
on camera and that vlog will be up
tomorrow on my vlog Channel so if you do
want to see it they'll be up tomorrow
but just so excited and so grateful to
thank you so much so my mom's got me
that and the case and then she got me
some other things to go with it so as
something that I was literally shocked
about what's so shocked about is this
and she got me something from Pandora
this is the gift bag it's so pretty and
I was like while I look she couldn't
believe it like the fact that she can't
sing from Pandora as you may have seen
when me after dark gift opening video
staff got me a Pandora bracelet which is
just up there and she got me a
bestfriend charm on it and my mum
actually got me the daughter charm to go
on it because I'm never normally a
person to wear jewelry I rarely ever
wear it but then when stuff with me that
bracelet I actually really like it I'm
gonna wear it all the time so I wear it
literally every day I'm I just never
only wear jewelry so my mum got me the
daughter
child to go on it and I love it so much
it's basically exactly the same as the
best friend charm it just says daughter
so I can't wait to put this on my
bracelet tonight and I'm so so grateful
so thank you so much my mum then it got
me something which I'm just like oh my
god this is literally me this is so nice
so you got me a large jar of Yankee
Candle but in at the scent maple pancake
this is an American exclusive as when
the food and spice range are so much you
got it from cause I've never seen this
before and she go through the Yankee
Candle store in Milton Keynes and it
smells oh my gosh it's just literally
insane like if you guys watch my floor
you will know that I'm obsessed with
pancakes so to get this is literally
heaven and the picture on the front is
so cool I love the color of it and just
everything about it so thank you so much
mom for that it came in at this gorgeous
Yankee Candle get back it was amazing so
I literally love this so thank you kind
of waits burn it probably start burning
it in my background actually because it
kind of matches my top the copper lamp
you feel mum also got me a new tangle
teezer this was in my wish list video
and I wanted it so bad I see various
gold
Tangle Teezer I literally obsessed with
soap as soon as I saw it in the shop I
was like it's rose gold I need that in
my life I love rose gold so she got me
here and I'm super super happy with it
it's the only go detangling brush and
yet it's just basically rose gold and
white and I always lose my tangle teezer
so I bought one imperative staff and I
don't know where it's gone like I
generally don't know where it's gone
cause she got me a new one so thanks for
buzzing to use that she then it got me
this cute little cactus trinket tray so
when we were in Paperchase one time I
saw it and I was like Jesus I really
like it but it's really expensive and it
was 12 pounds of it feels like I'm not
paying that but their mum was like I
really wanted to get it for you because
I know you really liked it and you're
sending what I really cute on my desk as
well so she just got me this little
cactus hold and she was like I thought
you could put your bracelet on it and
amber got me a Pandora ring for my
birthday Christmas last year one of them
last year so I'm gonna put them on here
but yeah I love it so so much it's so
cute said thank you for that she then it
got me this little pot all that Ted
Baker rose petals
mum has thinking behind everything bless
her she was like I thought it'd be
really good if you want to take like
photos and stuff like in the bath of
products and like everything iCloud she
really thought through it and she was
like the pot really cute as well for
when you finished with them so this is
basically they see if I can open it it's
basically just got rose petals in are
they scented
I don't know if they're scented but
nevertheless you know I mean like it's
really really cute and the pots adorable
as well so thank you so much mom I am
just obsessed with all the presents you
got me my mum also got me this top that
I'm wearing it was from
look she saw it she was like I thought
it was like urban out which is five
Tanner and you love urban out potato
like I do live in houses so she got me
this top and I really really liked it so
thought I'd wear it for today and we
were wearing from the box in their sales
as well because pretty pretty nice no
I'm not sure but I think that it's all
that my mum got me yeah I'm pretty sure
that's everything she got me so thank
you so much I wanna see it's so grateful
and I still cannot believe it then from
my little brother he got me a gift card
because apparently mum was trying to
find the two-faced gingerbread lipstick

actually surprised I had no idea I was
gonna get me these so thank you moving
on to mine and my nan did insanely well

name I wanted anything like mine and I'm
better than ever before so I would be
like whoa now you've killed it first of
all she got me this massive a hamper of

thank you so much man the Box is
beautiful she's fully like designed this
herself and everything so I was like
thank you she then got me something
which I was like oh my gosh I could
smell it through the paper and I smoked
it the night before and I was like I
know
it's in here and basically my dad got me
a massive lush gift set I literally am
addicted to lush and the reason I love
this one as well is because it's got all
bar forms in it because don't get me
wrong I love all lush products but the
products that I use the most are bath
bombs and bubble bars so when you buy
gift sets and you get like soaps nits
and stuff they don't really get used by
me so the fact that this has got nine
bath bombs in it makes me extremely
happy so it's got golden wonder shoot
for the stars at luxury lash PUD Snow
Fairy Jeni bond nothing for that one
Christmas sweater
thundersnow and never mind the
ballistics sure that dip and butter bear
nearly dropped it I'm really excited to
delve into this site when I have bath
and it come in to talk about packaging
but I can keep this box in my room and
just pick them out the packaging is so
so so beautiful so thank you now and you
just I love you and then I couldn't
quite believe this I open the box
because I'd mentioned these shoes to my
mum of mine and I really wanted them
that I've seen my friend Saburo show
who's also on red hair at the Christmas
party wearing them and I was like mum
and then I really want these shoes but I
didn't think when I would actually get
me them and then I opened the box and
it's a massive night box and basically
my Nana got me these night 95s airmax
these in the color oatmeal white is the
exact ones that I wanted there so like
vintage with the old air Mac side and I
wanted some new shoes because I've got
trainers I wear like all the time but I
really wanted some new ones and I like
fully obsessed with these shoes so thank
you so much now honestly I'm just
gobsmacked psyche I was gobsmacked if I
open the box I still can't believe it
so but like I said thank you about
10,000 times but thank you then my
sister Louise loads of people like oh my
god you have a sister she's my
stepsister she is my dad's daughter she
got me a really amazing photo frame and
it's got a picture of me and my niece in
it so this is my sister's daughter her

when I saw the picture in my heart lit
she just melted I'm gonna put it on my
desk behind me but I love it so much so
thank you so much this was so thoughtful
I love it my manager Rebecca got me this
really cute little like hanging bauble
of Minnie Mouse from at Disneyland

always have special baubles but my mom

my special bauble for the Christmas tree
so Thank You Rebecca I love it then
finally amber has given me some of her
precious presents so she said there's
one more main thing basket or coming on
the 29th so I'll put that in my vlog
when I actually get it but basically she
dumped me like a little Panther thing

and body is soothing balm I'm very
excited for that

bits that I really like using all the
time so thank you so much and the gift

massive at makeup set but that starts
tears because my mom was looking at it
