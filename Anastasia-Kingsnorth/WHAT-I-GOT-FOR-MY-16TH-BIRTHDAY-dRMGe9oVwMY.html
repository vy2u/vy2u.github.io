and I'm going to be doing and what I got
for my 16th birthday haul I am so
excited for this video because it was my
birthday on the 13th of October so like
last week when you'll see in this all
week before I remember how to work it
out but yeah I'm so excited this video
because I've done one for my 14th my
15th and now my 16th and I'm hoping you
can see some sort of glow up between
them all yeah my 14th one are pretty
tragic so that's not a while so of that
one but today I'm doing a white box my
16th birthday now I don't actually have
all of my presents with me because some
of them I actually ordered online and
they're still not here I think one of
them is at the post office but I just
haven't gone and got it yet and like
things like chocolate and stuff I'm not
going to show because either eating it
or it's downstairs in the kitchen but
yeah that's basically it I'm just going
to get straight into it and I really
hope you enjoy also I'm not trying to
brag boast anything like that I'm so so
thankful for everything I got and you
guys wanted to see this so that's why
I'm doing it so the first thing I got
off my mum which is like my main present
was something I definitely was not
expecting because I did not ask for at
all I didn't really even know you could
do it but basically I got driving
lessons
now you're probably going to think like
what you're 16 that normally you start
learning Drive at 17 this is basically
like a 2-hour experience from red-letter
days and you get to go to like I think
it's in Milton Keynes and you drive a
car they like teach you how to do it and
they film you while you're doing it so
you can take your home as a memory and
it just makes things easier for when
you're actually going to learn to drive
from what I've looked at it online is
you do it on some courts sort of like
carpark trap thing and there's loads
over the car at the same time it's at
traffic lights and everything like that
so you really do get a taste of what
it's like to drive I'm really excited
for it and it just came in this like
little red envelope with a gift card but
I've took the gift card out and put it
into my purse but yeah I'm super super
excited for it so thank you mom for that
I love it and then obviously because
that was I'm in person I wasn't
expecting anything like big uh my mom
actually got me a D - gazelles I wanted
gazelles for months now I originally
wanted the pink one but they are really
hard to find in my size
which is like a four and a half slash
five but my mama got me these lines
instead they like her off-white creamy
color and I literally love them so much
I love side the little gold gizelle bit
here and they're just so so comfy I've
worn them every single day since I've
had them see ya she got me some gazelles
so thank you so much I loved her mom
also then got me some little bit so she
got me the zona she designed a life she
loved little notebook set because I love
things like this and I'm going to use it
for school all the time so I think
that's just come off actually okay yeah
that's just come off but yeah you
basically just get like a load of
post-it notes this is her lifestyle
range which is available in boots I'm a
mum also got me two other things from
there she got me so a lifestyle
pencils and then the keyring as well
because I also got a house key which one
got cut for me was not my first one so
she wanted to get me a keyring for it
bless her and that was basically it off
my mum she also got me some new curlers
because my curlers broke my little
brother broke them cuz he likes like
holding them and stuff so just got me
two new colors and then she just got me
chocolate and she gave me 20 pounds as
well so thank you so much mama I
actually love all our presents so too so
much I was not expecting them she also
got me some really nice flowers
delivered and then I have some like
balloons up here which wait they're
coming yeah I have the one in the six
which I love just gonna leave that there
then from my dad I actually got makeup
because basically you gave me money but
I didn't really know what to get with it
so I wouldn't make up but I only have
two of the things here right now because
the other order isn't here yeah I
basically ordered a ton of stuff from
colour-pop if you do want me to do like
a colour-pop haul and boxing everything
like that I will do I don't know yet if
I have to pay customs because is it I
think is it the post office oh it hasn't
been delivered yet I'm not too sure but
yes I don't know how to pay customs but
if you don't need to do a whole video on
it let me know because I did get quite a
bit but then I also put an ordering on
beautybay with the other money that you
gave me and I'm so excited about this I
wanted a morphe palette for so long
so I finally decided to get one it was
19 pounds 50 which i think is so worth
it because I've never seen a palette
more pigmented than this so my palette
is a 35 teen as you can see it is
absolutely gorgeous
I wanted a burgundy eyeshadow
it comes with the perfect burgundy and
all of like the shimmers are just like
the perfect colors for me I'm so excited
about this palette in considering it was
only 19 pound 50 I'm definitely going to
be ordering a load more of these I
literally just want all the morphe
palettes so yeah I got that up dad's
money and then the other thing I got was
something from Gerard cosmetics and now
I see this brand all over Instagram like
the kind of like makeup goals account so
I decided to kind of like order one
because only 10 pounds I have it on
today mine is in the shade hydramat
ecstasy and I love this so much
I've worn this every time I've been out
since I got it and it just looks like
this it has it's gorgeous little gold
lid and it's like this off purple color
so it's kind of like muted it's so nice
and this is basically I would say if not
the same it's better than the Kylie lip
kits because the formula is amazing it
drives just like that and it stays on my
lips all day like literally all day no
matter how much I drink or eat so yeah I
literally love this so much
I'm definitely maybe getting more of
these beautybay is amazing I didn't
realize they did all this stuff so go
through today yeah thank you Dad for my
money to get all of that way that I'm so
so grateful for that so before I get in
to my friends presence I just wanted to
say like people like mine and my uncle
they all got me money and vouchers but I
haven't actually spent them yet because
there for like Topshop Debenhams and a
few other places already part remember
but yeah I haven't spent them yet so I'm
not going to show them because they're
in my purse but thank you for those I
love my car mate to go and spend them so
now I'm going to show what amber got
even my other friends as well basically
got me money pouches and then my friend
Tanisha got me some like five sets and a
really nice mug but that's down there
and I can't reach it it's behind my
studio life but thank you so much I
literally love all the things you got me
so then amber got me some really nice
pictures so I'm going to show you what
amber got me to have them here
she got me a balm cosmetics bath set is
how we call them yeah I guess it's like
the balm cosmetics gift box I'm so
excited for this I haven't actually
opened it yet so I don't exactly know
what's inside other than what I can see
on here but I'm so excited for this so
thank you she then got me a Victoria's
Secret spray in endless love and this
smells so good this is like my type of
scent like I always kind of like
pink things but maybe that like they're
not the sense that I actually like like
I really love this scent but I would
never know me pick it because it's blue
so I'm so happy that she got me this
because I love it I was so good she then
also got me one of these candles and
it's called rose petals a delicate
handful I see these everywhere but I'm
not exactly short of the brand lily
flame maybe yeah it's so good it's like
that oh my gosh and it smells amazing
like literally I love this so much
I'm so excited to burn this I want it's
like more towards Christmas and I get
rid of my autumn background this will be
in the background she also got me this
from new logos I'm so excited about
because we were talking about how much I
love unicorns and she obviously took no
and she got me this and it's like a
unicorn light so I'm going to put that
on one of my shelves and it lights up
pink as well so I'm super excited for
this and I haven't been able to open it
because I wanted to show like it in a
video but yeah put up this and finally
this is like my favorite thing that she
got me she got me these abelev Beauty
mini perfumes ever since I went to this
other apartment I knew that I really
really wanted these and she knew how
much I wanted them and she got me them
so I'm so excited I have the let spritz
and placed on whistling like full-sized
but I've used them up and I see the new
bake my day as Sweet Inspirations what
is in here so I'm super excited for this
say thank you and bye I love my presence
so much I also forgot one thing that my
mom got me actually because it was
pulled under the present but she got me
this wish jar and you basically both
quite self-explanatory you might be
wishes on it and then like you see if
they come true in a few years it's
always a really nice idea because it's a
lot of wishes and hopes that I have for
my life but I don't really like share
them much so it is a really good idea I
think keep the nice jar and kind of keep
them to myself and see if they come true
and then finally my little brother got
me some things but obviously like my mom
chose him because he's only like two and
a half you can probably hear him in the
background of half my videos but he got
me this little cactus and Primark which
I love because mum knows I love cactuses
so and then he got me this copper clock
which was from Asda I'm guessing but I
was saying I wanted a clock column for
my room because I keep waking up late so
she got me a clock I'm not really sure
I'm gonna put it yellow so don't
have a full space but we'll find
somewhere so yeah does everything I got
for my 16th birthday I really really
really hope you enjoyed this video if
you did give it a huge thumbs up and
thank you so much for all of like the
birthday wishes
literally there was so many of you
saying happy birthday to me on Twitter
Instagram snapchat it was insane and it
literally made my birthday so much
better so thank you so so so much but
yeah I love you all so much
and I'll see you in next week's video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
