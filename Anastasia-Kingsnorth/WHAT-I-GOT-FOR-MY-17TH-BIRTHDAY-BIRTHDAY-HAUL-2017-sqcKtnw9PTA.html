going to be doing a 17th birthday haul
or what I got for my birthday 2017 so on
Friday the 13th I actually turned 17
which is so crazy to me like I don't
feel 17 at all people always ask they're
like how old do you know today yeah I'm
sitting there like what you look so much
older if he would never believe that I
was 16 and now I'm 17 I like it just
feels weird saying like I'm 17 years old
just I don't feel it today are we doing
a birthday haul because these are my
most requested videos every year you
guys love seeing what I got for my
birthday so I thought it'd be really
nice to film it for you guys I've got
some really amazing things and I'm
honestly so blessed I also posted a
photo on Instagram I'll insert it on the
screen here and basically it literally
blew up so thank you guys so much it was
my most expert on Instagram out to be
mentor so if you haven't already go
follow my Instagram we're so close to
300 thousand followers on there which
that's crazy
thank you but yeah today are we doing a
birthday horse so I guess I'm just going
to get straight into it and I really
hope you guys enjoy so the first thing
I'm going to show you is from my mum and
my mum and it got me one present purely
because of how expensive this was and I
was literally in shock when I walked
downstairs and I saw the box it's
Louboutin what I left you saw the orange
box and I was like no way and then I
just saw them do it I was like oh okay
like I don't know anything from leaveit
I'm like it's so expensive and I
genuinely cannot believe my mom got me
this
so you open it out like a little drawer
which is like the cutest thing ever
and then inside you've got this and it's
basically a little duster bag for my
present which oh my god it's just
wrapped up so beautifully so then you
just open it up she got me a Louis
Vuitton purse so this is the mini zippy
wallet and I still cannot believe that
she got me a new Vuitton purse I love
this so much it's one of the classic or
if not the most classic Louie Vuitton
pattern you can get and I love this so
as you said like the LV on both sides
and
it's just incredible and then all the
detailing is gold and it says Louis
Vuitton on the zip as well and you could
honestly feel the quality in this when
you're holding it like it's crazy and
then obviously I'm pretty sure like it's
all real leather and then inside it's
all brown and you've got lots of
different compartments for carbs and
change and because I was here half are
like mini Michael Kors backpack I
thought it would be kind of nice let's
have a smaller pair so what I asked for
a smaller purse I definitely did not
expect this one so honestly mo I can't
thank you enough like I'm still in shock
I've looked in it so many times since I
opened it and I just can't actually
can't so thank you so much for that like
that was my only present the moment got
me and obviously like ever put you in
store because it was ridiculously
expensive so thank you so much mama I
love what you got me and all of the
balloons and everything it meant so much
to me and I can't wait to like put it in
my back and stuff I've been saving it
I'm currently filming this on Saturday
but I've been saving it to like after
this video to like put my money in it
and stuff but yeah love it thank you
and then my dad also got me something
which is like designer so I was like
she's perfect oh I'll it she conned so
amazing thing got me the Iguchi in bloom
perfume and I spelt this in the shop I'm
gonna open it for you guys I smelt this
in the shop and how long ago maybe like
a month ago when I was been in
Birmingham and I was like sure that this
sounds really good my mom wasn't keen on
it she was like oh I don't know but like
I loved it so much so it's like this
it's like the floral patterning and then
it's got black and I'm never like
normally a big perfume where I just
always forget to put it on or just like
put sprays on which I carry around in my
bag I just think it's much easier to do
that so when I was like okay you know
what I'm actually gonna start wearing
perfume so this is the first time opened
it so this is really exciting oh my gosh
it's so open up the black packaging and
then the bottle it looks like this this
is littering me all over since you just
pink white and black and it just says
Beauty bloom on it and then it says
Gucci on the top as well and you can
tell what the quality of the bottle this
is like you know oh my gosh it's are so
good it's a really floral scent so like
if you really like the floor sense then
you will love this but I'm actually
obsessed with this and I'll go to a
party tonight
so I'm gonna wear it there but oh my god
this is literally gonna be money
everyday cents so if you guys want to
know what I felt like a bit weird but
yeah I'll be really like this thank you
so much dad for getting me this I love
it and I'm honestly over the moon so I'm
just gonna like package it back up and
pop it this box again also I'm
definitely gonna keep this box because
it's like all floral inside and on the
outside and that are really cute on my
shelf so yeah thank you so much dad and
thank you so much mom still can't
believe it and then at my little brother
Atticus he's only 3 years old so
obviously colour my mum like chose it
but it was from him he got me it's three
things as I said he got me this little
photo frame and it's copper and marble
and it says love hope dream obviously
because my room is very like copper very
marble very like so I'm actually stuck
to my very like Ben TG but modern so he
thought that was look really nice so I
got this and yeah I love this so much
it's not just like a normal photo frame
or you could take out and perfect win it
but I like this so gonna pop that on my
shelf thank you very much Atticus for
that you ain't got me to make up
products but one which I've had before
but I've used up up and then one new one
and it is the connection and lasting
perfection concealer but this is the
green colour correcting one I wanted to
try this for so long because I normally
use the Urban Decay color correcting one
the green one but it's literally like
run out so you got me this autumn and
got me this has got me this I love this
so much I'm yet to use it I'm going to
try it out tonight but yeah so thank you

also picked me up with the Maybelline at
lash sensational mascara because he
knows this is my favorite mascara you

until it ran out and I love this so much
so so happy to have another one of these
I was thinking to myself the other day I
need to go buy another Maybelline lash
sensational so thank you so much Atticus

at to mine and mine and actually got me
some clothes from Urban Outfitters
because Urban Outfitters has recently
been my second home I am fully obsessed
with all of the things that they do in
there it's just very much like my style
now my style has changed to kind of like
a bit more like a modern vintage style
so very much liking Urban Outfitters so
first of all my name got me some socks
but they're the champion socks and I
thought these would look really nice
with my trainers and stuff I tried the
one last night and they do it really
good so I got a pair of these I just
really wanted
like branded socks just to where they
like people over the top of your
trainers if that makes sense but they're
really thick really soft and really nice
and yeah love theater thank you very
much none for these and then she got me
two t-shirts so this one I don't really
know if my North league is the brand
oh it just says cooperative so I don't
really know what the brand is of this it
might just be a burnout fitness but it's
basically a yellow top got like a blue
bit here then it just says North league
and then it's got some stripes on it and
stuff I just really liked it I found it
on the website and I was like yeah
that's really nice so I just got this it
I thought it was gonna be like a jumper
and not like a cottony Jersey material
but it's still really nice I still went
with a coat and stuff but yeah love this

it was super comfy so thank you Dan for
that and then she also got me a Stussy

plum but I was like you know I have way
too many like black clothes so I went
for like the salmon II pinky color and

the stuffing writing is actually in
brown and not black I just think it has
something a bit different to it so I
