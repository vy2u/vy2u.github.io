going to be doing a what is in my bag
for autumn 2017 now I recently when I
say recently I mean back in August have
got a new handbag that I'm super excited
about and I wanted to film this for a
while but you know what a hold of them
till I do my autumn videos because these
always seem to fit with autumn I don't
know why but I've got a bag and I always
get requested on what is in it like just
time I was in my school bag so I always
do really well so I thought I would do a
what is in my normal bag as you guys
seem it to love it but ya know it's
basically all I have to say I hope you
guys have enjoyed my autumn videos if
you all remember to give it a huge
thumbs up Majors check out all of my
others and yeah I really hope you
enjoyed the video and let's get started
so this is my bag it's actually really
small I'm really cute this is basically
a Michael Kors mini backpack now I don't
actually think this is a smallest one
they do surprisingly I'm pretty sure
they actually do one smaller than this
because there was one that would have
fit my person and I was like okay well I
can't get that then this is like the
second to smallest I think and it's in a
grey color I was gonna get black but
then I was like everybody gets black
bags normally so I was like you know
what okay great one you probably won't
go with as much but I thought it'd be
different so I got a great one and then
it's got a silver detailing it's got
these studs here it's got four rows of
studs and I love this detailing so much
I think it would look nice without the
studs but I love it with them and it
just is Michael Kors here it's got a
front compartment it's got a back
compartment and then obviously this is a
back pack so it's got the straps which
are quite long actually the only thing
I'm not really keen on about this is
it's quite reflective I want it to be
completely matte and it is but in like
light and stuff it just looks very very
reflective this is my favorite bag ever
I think it was 149 pounds from the best
of village outlet store so it's probably
meant to be a bit more expensive but I
always go to bit advantage if I'm gonna
bribed designer stuff so yeah I love
this so much
it was 149 pounds but genuinely load one
of the best 150 pounds I've ever spent
it's so comfy it's so like I don't know
the bags are so strong you can just tell
it's not gonna break touchwood and yeah
I just love this so much
so without further ado
let's get on it what's actually inside
the bag so all the detailing is actually
silver which I really like as well which
is nice and then to go with it I
actually had this for longer and I've
just realized it's dirty so I got this
last December while I was with SAFF when
we were shopping but to go with it I
actually have a Michael Kors purse the
only annoying thing is this is a kind of
nudie peach color with gold detailing
then obviously my bag is grey with
silver detailing but I got the first
verse so I didn't like buy them to match
and I also got this in the sale I bought
this in Milton Keynes and I got it for
sixty pounds and I think it's meant to
be like 120 so I've got that for a lot
cheaper this is basically just a very
long like a nudie colored pink purse so
just as Michael Kors gold detailing and
then when you open it I'm scared this is
gonna be messy okay it's not actually
too bad but basically it's got all my
stuff in here so I've got a gift card
bouncer for some driving lessons if it
they're not my proper driving lessons I
just like the ones where you can go
learn to drive at 16 got a debenhams
gift card which I probably use I've got
my driving licence or my provisional
license because I can start to drive
literally my birthdays on Friday 13th so
I think in a few days after this video
goes up got my Nando's card which is
obviously the most important thing in my
purse because everybody needs a Nando's
card I've got my Sephora beauty card
superdrug card and I basically just got
a little like train tickets and receipts
and stuff because I started to keep all
my receipts but yeah this is a really
nice per se use to be a lot more
cluttered I actually didn't organize it
a few weeks ago so it's not as bad but
yeah I love this so much and it goes
really nicely with my bag and then
obviously I have to keep my phone in at
my bag I actually forgot that I normally
keep this in my bag
so I wasn't even going to show you this
but I just have the iPhone 7 plus isn't
it weird though that when a new iPhone
comes out your phone starts to break and
I'm just like because it's not actually
really slow it's like not updating and
stuff and I'm just like yeah that's
weird
hmm haven't even had it for a year but
um yeah also this background is so funny
it says I don't need the internet the
internet needs me I'm actually gonna
change if I found any money laughs so
yeah I have this and then my phone case
is from maschino or Mashti now how are
you like to
and I just got the little bear well it
says this is not a machine Oh toy and I
love this cage so much so yeah I
have that and my phone is actually rose
gold but I've only got the case on to
protect it because I actually like it
with that case better but I don't want
to drop it and smash it and break it to
you for more than it's already breaking
then moving on in it to my bag I have my
vlog camera so this is just the canon
g7x mark ii that i actually managed to
smash well done me i never smash any of
my stuff and then somehow managed to
smash this and i have this in my bag
factory de vlog if you guys didn't know
so link tiny box will be down below but
yeah this camera is so good it's also
really good for taking photos the only
thing is it's quite like not a fisheye
lens so it's quite a wide-angle lens so
tough be careful with that but it's
really nice and then i have this cute
little mirror which is from Primark so I
picked this up for a pound and I just
always needed a mirror or you know when
it reflects that's pretty I always need
a mirror in my bag and always time I
look in the iPhone camera and it just
doesn't do justice I was like you know
what I'll just get a mirror and this is
only a pound and it's pink with palm
tree leaves on it I thought that was so
good for a pound because if you went
anywhere else for a mirror or like what
we've done this nice little pattern on
it you probably pay like five or six
pound in this day and age so Primark for
a pound I don't recommend them then I
have a mini perfume and this is actually
from Primark as well I picked this up
quite a few weeks ago actually and it
shirt it was literally two pounds it's
just a mini bottle when it says good
vibes only there's got like a marble
background with a gold lid and it smells
so good I love this like it's not like
proper long lasting because like it was
only two pounds but it smells really
nice if you just need like a quick
top-up plus its mini and considering my
bag is quite small I just needed a
little kind of tiny thing to put in
there and it sounds really nice so I
kind of said recommend prymaat perfumes
then I have a bath oh boy works hand
sanitizer so I've got my pocket back in
right raspberry vinyl actually forgot
this as in here it's always just go to
the bottom of my bag but so that's very
fresh I actually have a new one which I
got in my bath and Bodyworks haul like
more or to be one I think it was like
unicorn tears so I'm going to swap them
over but yeah I just keep this in my bag
you know like it
go into that public toilets get stuff on
my hands it's very handy to carry a hand
sanitizer around with you then I have
something out of Arthur body works this
is the marshmallow pumpkin latte a body
lotion and I always keep my lotion in my
bag because you never know when
somebody's gonna need like cream like
it's oh you think you're not going to
need it but when you don't have it
something's like Japanese hungry would
you have any body cream and I'm just
like you know what I do this was three
or four pounds from eBay actually yeah
it really wasn't that expensive and it
smells so good it's like so or to me and
it's just in like a really small bottle
as you can see compared to my head so
it's really easy to fit in my bag and
it'll be yeah you'd be surprised how
many people need body lotion because
obviously you can use this as hand cream
as well but so good then I have another
thing from Bath and Body Works I promise
you this is the last thing from there
and this is one of the new hand creams
this is in the flavor or scent pumpkin
cupcake and it just says pumpkin butter
and oh my god it smells so good
this is the most awesome e thing I've
ever so it's quite sickly which is only
like the only annoying thing when you
put it on your hands and you smell it
you're like well you may take them back
but it's really nice I love the
packaging as well it's like gold and
pink and white and it's basically just
me all over basically I love this so
much and this was four pounds or five
pounds from eBay so quite fancy for a
hand cream but it's worth of body work
so I gave in that is everything in the
main compartment of my bag and then you
also have a little compartment here and
then another compartment the other side
and on the other side I keep my house
key so I actually got this my birthday
last year because it didn't have a house
key so my mum got me one cut and it's
got like this kind of blue me star
pattern on it and then it's on my zoella
little keyring and this says inspired
it's a shrimper Home Collection
I think last year yeah last year and I
love this so much it just got the little
said on it and I'd literally only have
one key so it's basically what it looks
like but I just keep this in the pocket
of my bag I never like medians come home
and my mom's like I'm moving on in to
the front of my bag I don't know really
what I keep in here oh I have a ton of
receipts which is fun oh my god okay
that's kind of concerning I have my bank
card
just flying around in the bottom but
that my purse I basically you've got a
ton of receipts where did I go into
Frankie and Benny's I went to Frankie
and Benny's that's the same day I went
to the post office the posts and parcels
so that's fun who doesn't love like
looking back to all the money they've
spent and then I also it all great I
have another receipt from bnm then I
have a little portable charger so this
is from CR tail end and they actually
sent me it and it's like literally web
everything ever so you meant to put the
lead in there and then just as CRA it's
got low bright stars and then it's just
this rose gold glittery one it's super
lightweight I think it charges your
phone twice which is really good it's
fully charged at the moment so yeah I
love this so much thank you so much the
art in London for sending me this
because it is coming in great handy and
then I also have a top-up of my lipstick
so I don't actually have this on today
but I always keep this in my bag it's
just like my go-to color and this is my
Mac retro matte liquid lip color in the
shade burnt spice actually looks like
the one I'm wearing today I've got to
face melted in a child star on today but
this is just a backup I actually prefer
these two matte lipsticks these are so
much better because I prefer matte
liquid lipsticks like once you try
liquid lipsticks it's so hard to go back
so I always keep this in my bag as just
kind of like a backup and it's like the
perfect autumn shade so that stays in my
front pocket and yeah that is basically
everything in my bag my bag is our
completely emptied out there's a lot
more light weight now but yeah I love it
so much like it's really deceiving
because it's quite small but it can
actually fit so much in it I really hope
you guys enjoyed this video if you
