going to be doing what is in my winter
makeup bag for drugs'll version and the
high-end version I get so many questions
about what makeup I use on an everyday
basis instead of doing like a normal
like everyday makeup routine I thought I
would do you guys a video what I show
you a drugstore versions and high-end
versions of products so to a point like
drugstore dupes but basically I'm just
showing you a bunch of my favorite
makeup also I'm so excited right now
because it's snowing outside my window
it looks so beautiful and I try to film
in front of the window so you guys could
see the snow but you know lighting just
don't work I just blacked out didn't
work out all but anyway it's snowing if
it was so Christmasy and yeah but
without further ado it let's just get
straight on into the video because I
have so much makeup to show you and I
love makeup so let's get into it and now
I don't actually have a drugstore primer
I took them all out because I didn't use
them nobody was gonna use them so I am
gonna buy me one cuz I love the baby
skin but for high-end I use the Smashbox
photo finish foundation primer and this
is the color correcting a just green one
now I haven't really read an oily skin
which means green like any color
corrector type of thing works really
well on my skin and this Smashbox one
works wonders it is literally it's so so
good I love it so much it blows my skin
it feels super smooth and my makeup goes
on amazingly I just love it so much so I
have this one and it retails at about in
1952 2250 I think I got it from the
cosmetics company store I've been to the
village so I've got a bit of a discount
on it cuz obviously it's like a makeup
outlet store but yeah I love this so
much
moving on to foundation my drugstore
well I'll talk about my high-end point
first because I'm obsessed with this I
have recently been loving in the Marc
Jacobs foundation I picked this up in
Sephora when I was in Paris by the way
check my vlogmas if you want to see when
i was in paris but yeah it was
absolutely gorgeous it was 40 euros and
he basically just put it up like this
the only thing I don't like about it is
the applicator
I would have preferred it to be a pump
and I just spilt a load of this
out I just don't really like the
applicator on it to be honest it's not
my favorite one at all and I think they
could have improved it a lot by giving
it a pump because I do lose a lot of
foundation but nevertheless the coverage
is insane and I'll put a float on screen
if when I use this and my a cup just
looks so good but of course a drug so
cheap of this has to be my absolute
favorite little real true match this
foundation already won about forever and
ever and ever I use it in pretty much
every makeup tutorial when it's not
first impressions because I just love it
so much it's ten pounds the bottles
beautiful really good coverage I find
the darker the shade the better the
coverage for me personally so I went up
a shade and it covered a lot more but
yeah love this for concealer for
high-end again this is a fairly recent
purchase but has made its way straight
into one of my everyday makeup routines
and this is right to face Born This Way
concealer so this is a mini that I
picked up when I was again in Sephora
and I love it so much it's so creamy it
blends so perfectly and it's not too
thick it's not as thick as some
concealers but it's not as running some
concealers and I prefer very liquidy
ones but know that it does give really
good coverage and does last all day
without creasing under my eyes and of
course the dupe for this its connection
last imperfection and collecting you
just can't go wrong with this I'm sorry
- fair one is four pounds 20 best thing
ever I felt like I've wrote on about
this enough I don't actually need to say
anything else because it is the most
amazing concealer ever but I use it on
everyday basis and I have done for
nearly two years now and I don't have
any faults with it full powder for high
end it's actually a loose powder and
you're probably expecting me to say the
Laura Mercier but that actually ran out
so I got a new a new one and this is
from Beauty Bay and it's from the brand
Beauty bakery and this is the flour
baking powder I love this so much it's
literally so good so it's just like a
gold lid then it's kind of like a banana
powder because it's got a bit more
yellow under color to it but it's so
good I've set my makeup with this on
doing my eyebrows and then I just blend
it into my skin it doesn't leave any
like nasty orange patches or anything
like that and I think this is about 20
pounds and again get off Beauty Bay but
I'm gonna link all the products down
below but yeah love this so much and if
my drugstore powder but I have to use
all the time is just my room will stay
matte
she cracked the lid in half drop my
makeup bag yesterday Anna this is just
in the shade transparent at its a
pressed powder it's for 399 4 pound and
it's amazing and I just smash it in half
again so so good my mum has sworn by
this for literally over 1011 years like
she loves this she never changed there
so I love it - basically it's so good
and really you have done well here for
blush my favourite ever high-end blush
is the Mac blush in Desert Rose SAFF
told me to buy this and it is incredible
I have it on today
I don't know how what you can see I
didn't put too much on but it's matte
for one there's absolutely no undertones
of shimmers which personally I like
shimmered blushes because I put a little
highlight on I prefer my blush to be
dead Matt this was just it was it
amazing I love it so much it's such a
beautiful color as well it's not too
much although you can build it up very
easily if you do keep putting your brush
on I repeat in what I put on your face
and it does really build it up but it
gives you such a natural flush and yeah
this is just amazing and I think this is
about 18 pounds a really good truth is
the sleek blush palette in the shade
pink lemonade so this has got three
amazing blushes in it one of them is a
cream and then two of them a powder the
only thing with these are they are all
shimmery even the cream one has some
shimmer in it which you know like if I'm
not wearing a lot of highlight then it's
good or if I'm not like gonna go through
the contour look then it's good but I
don't know it's a really good joob
though this shade here is gorgeous I
don't if you guys can see that but it's
super super pretty it's kind of like a
Barbie pink the um what's the blush
called from sleek rose gold sneak blush
in rose gold is another amazing blush as
well but yeah seek brushes are really
good dupes and this palette was only ten
pounds and you get a massive mirror in
it too so winning bought contour and
bronzer from high-end I'm absolutely
addicted to my Anastasia Beverly Hills
contour kit I use this every single day
as you can see it is quite used don't
really get as much use out these three
but these three here I mixed it all
three shades together and I'm just
absolutely addicted I cannot even tell
you guys I use this every single day for
the past Jesus energies I've had it over
again now because I've got it went to my
brother's when I went to America
last year in August I've had it for
every year and it still hasn't run out
and I still haven't had to refill it so
those are probably the best like forty
fifty dollars so about forty quid I've
ever ever spent the middle shade isn't
really Roche but I like these two out
two shades but when you make someone
together you'd already noticed but yeah
this is so good and then a jeep for that
which is actually something that I've
only recently started to use again is it
my Maybelline New York brick bronzer I
mean when they came out with this and I
was so excited I was like Oliver there's
an email reading pro and to get it
because I love Maybelline I'm such a
sucker for their products they came up
with this and you get like a little like
highlighter with it and then you get the
bronzer and I think this duo is about
eight pounds and you obviously you get a
mirror as well which is really cool but
like it's not one of those really clear
mirrors it's one of those like musky
mirrors this bronzer shade is literally
my shade it's perfect and the
highlighter is super pretty as well
they're gold in the bricks it kind of
like overtakes it but you can also
bronze with this I guess that's really
pretty
this is eight pounds and this is
definitely one of my favorite ever
bronzers from the drugstore I also love
what what the other bronzers that I
really love
L'Oreal do some really good ones and
there was another bronze that I've
really liked and I can't and what it was
if I remember I'll put it down below but
yeah this is really good highlight my
god highlight it's like my favorite
thing ever I use it all the time I love
putting on my nose on my cheekbones on
my Cupid's bow it's just an addiction
sorry I was just checking if it's still
smelling but it's kind of like stopping
now I really don't want it to rank so I
want to go play in snow so this is the
sea art a London highlight in the shade
starburst 197 and first of all the
packaging is absolutely gorgeous and
then when you open it because of my long
nails I keep like poking it it did have
a gorgeous like little pattern in it
where it was like all stars and
everything but I've used it so much the
pattern is gone but this shade is just
absolutely stunning sort of fell into my
nose because it is just I feel like my
nose is like flinging now I'm not too
sure but it's such a gorgeous highlight
I'm not actually sure how much these
retail out because they did kind of send
this to my P o box but I don't think
they're too too expensive or those CRT
is kind of like a high-end brand I guess
but the packaging is amazing and of
course you get a mirror with it which
comes in massive handy because when I go
on my travels I always forget to take a
mirror so I always have to use this
mirror to do my whole makeup oh my god
my nose is glowing what I loved it so
much and if anything this is the
highlighter i would recommend over
anything saying that though a drugstore
version or a drugstore palette should I
say a holiday I'm absolutely addicted to
is these soft as nails at revolution
palette I did a collab with Sophie on my
channel a few weeks ago it was going for
Christmas collab so if you haven't seen
that already I will link it down below
but this is her soap x revolution makeup
palette and it is gorgeous like these
highlighters are something else I love
this well I love all the shades but
these shades here are my favorite and
this gold trade is so underestimated
it's patently insane I don't really get
as much use out these ones because these
aren't for my skin tone but it's a
really good palette how she's done it
for every single skin tone but yeah
these are only retail at 8 pounds 8
highlighters basically I'm getting the
promo in there for you so so I think you
should really go buy this because it's
so good see all the highlighters on my
hands now because it just it transfers
so easily onto your face it's amazing
the pigmentation of all of them are just
I'm just I love it for eyebrows now I
don't have this product but from the
drugstore I absolutely love the Ardo dip
brow bow that Ardell pomade whatever you
want to call it it's incredible I'm
going to link it down below I use this
and literally until it ran out and
finding it hard to find it now because I
actually don't stock it in my town but
it is so good it was the perfect shade
for me so now when that ran out I now
have another one and I've started using
the antenna beverly hills dipbrow now
I'm aware I did sales like don't like it
couldn't get on with it but it was just
because the first layer is very very
liquidy and what liquids probably the
wrong word it just glides too easy for
me because it made me make mistakes like
basically overdrew my brows really big
but once you start getting into it like
I've literally hit like at the bottom of
this little pop now then it starts to
dry out a little bit I can do my
eyebrows better with it so I've gone it
on today but I think I need to get a
darker shade since dye my hair this
color because this was like great for
this type of hair but not this time fast
I underestimated this it is really good
I do really like it I'm gonna get the
Ardo and when I can't but I did
underestimate this and the as agent
hills dipbrow is a winner for me now I
shall open it so I don't actually have
any from the drugstore but some that are
really good are the softest nails at
revolution again a her palette is
amazing
it's in my drawer so I can I want to get
up and get it but it is amazing and what
the MUA undressed me pallets are really
good as well I'm a sleek imaginative
palettes are really good I just got two
high-end ones I really want to show you
cuz I'm obsessed with them the first one
is the violet Voss Pro palette this is
so good beautybay kindly sent me this
and look at all those amazing shades if
you are a makeup addicts like me this is
like the perfect palette it's got the
proper burgundy shade which is called
wine and dine proper nice orange shade
it's basically just got all the shades
that a girl once in this palette
basically I just really like it and it's
perfect for the winter as well because
it's so warm toned and you get a massive
mirror which is really badly reflecting
in the light so I really is already this
palette is just so so beautiful and I
swear by I use it so so much especially
this gold trade here as you can see
that's quite dug in too because it's so
good I think this palette probably
retails at about 4 th pounds but you get
a good contrast between the maps and the
shimmers in this talent and the glitter
shades so it's really good and you
really can get so many eyeshadow looks
from this another pattern that I'm
addicted to at the moment is the color
drain Queen of Hearts palette I did a
first impressions tutorial which again I
will link it down below and I'll just
pop it on screen now I loved it so much
like it was really really good I didn't
think it was gonna be that good but it
was amazing now I actually cracked the
mirror the other day I didn't if you
guys can see so I'm really annoyed about
that but here are these shades they're
absolutely gorgeous again you've got a
really good mixture of mattes and
shimmers you've got six shimmers and six
matte shades and the white shades like I
don't know about you but white eye
shadows I find it really hard to find a
proper pigmented one this one isn't
matte it does have a little bit of a
shimmer but it is very very pigmented so
I do really like it I love this purple
shade and these glitter shades and this
orange shade and the shade and basically
all the shades they're really really
good and you can complete so many makeup
looks with this you can also use the
white shade for highlighter and some of
the shimmer champagne for an inner
corner highlight because they're just so
so beautiful and I'm not really sure
again how much this palette retails at
I think it's about 25 30 pounds but it
is so good and for 12 hours shadows
that's not a bad price at all cuz
they're doing their very big pants and
it's really pigmented
I'm really sorry at how much this is
reflecting for mascara a high-end
mascara that I've been loving recently
is the urban decay troublemaker they
sent this to my p.o box and the want is
absolutely insane like how good is that
I use this if I'm not wearing our
eyelashes like obviously I've got
eyelashes on today but I just used the
mascara wand again to blend them
together and it's so good this retails
below 20 pounds and the packaging as
well is amazing and I don't actually
have to come are shoes which is always
open win situation this is really good
for bottom eyelashes as well because the
brush is too big and bulky that you
can't get into the inner corner and like
without like smudging it everywhere it's
so annoying isn't it when you like do
the brush and then it goes on your nose
or like here or here and then you have
to blend it yeah I know I'm going on
business annoying just really really
good love the packaging love the one
before me was great
basically my eyelashes look so good when
I wear this but a drugstore mascara that
I'm absolutely obsessed with as I've
been obsessing it so long and I talk
about all the time it's the Maybelline
lash sensational this is so good this is
easily my fifth or sixth tube of it it
retails at eight pounds get it from
anywhere that sells maybelline they've
recently put out a gigi hadid version so
I think I need to get that because it's
Gigi did and you know this it looks so
good and I just love it so much and the
brush is amazing you got the little one
to the bottom eyelashes big one to your
top eyelashes basically I love it you
need to buy it it's so good for
lipsticks I love matte liquid lipsticks
so much and from high-end I've got some
to do face color pop and Anastasia
Beverly Hills this is a gloss and these
to a matte basically I love nude
lipsticks and this one here the Too
Faced melted in child stopper to have on
today is my most used lipstick ever I've
never used a lipstick more than I have
used this it's just absolutely in saying
it's such a beautiful nude color love it
so much this Anastasia lip gloss is
again gorgeous and the color pop one
inch wrap is such a gorgeous brown tones
news from the drugstore I love it
liquid lipsticks I've got some of their
liquid sways and their lips lingerie
here the shade ranges are in sane look
at my makeup collection if you want to
see all of them they're just absolutely
gorgeous I've got every single one
because they actually sent me the lip
vault which came with like 40 of each I
think so check make a collection if you
want to see the full collection but
these are both matte as you know the
thickest waves aren't but the lip launch
rates are but yeah honestly best formula
best lipsticks so that is the end of
