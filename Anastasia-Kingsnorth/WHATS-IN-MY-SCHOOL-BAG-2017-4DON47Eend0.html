back and I am going to doing a what is
in my school bag for summer 2017 now
then it is so weird because I have
actually done my GCSEs this year when
you see in this video I don't yet have
my result I get my result on Thursday
the 24th and I'm going to be doing a
live reaction a demo GTC with all this
will be up on that Thursday so look out
for that but it's so weird because I've
obviously left school now and I am kind
of going to sit for I'm just obviously
waiting for my braid to see what I get
but it's so with I incur intense coulis
and I don't know what I'm doing a sixth
form I don't know what I'm doing
so it's very weird to be doing a what's
in my school bag but nevertheless I do
have everything ready to go back to
school so I thought I would show you
what I keep in it I am actually so happy
with my school bag and everything this
year I really have put a lot of effort
into it and that sounds weird but I've
kind of got like everything matching and
that makes me very very very happy go so
I'm very excited to show you I really
hope you enjoy the video if you did give
it a huge thumbs up and I should get
started
so my bag I actually got from Vista
village and if you didn't see in my blog
when I bought it I will link it down
below I do have a daily vlogging channel
where I'm currently daily vlogging I
love it so much so if you do want to go
watch my vlogs I have some pretty good
ones that I'm not going to lie I'll
leave a link on-screen and down below
but this is basically in my schoolbag it
is a huge pastel pink Michael Kors one
and I'm itchy in love with this bag I've
never seen it like from one cause before
but it's basically so heavy it basically
pastel pink it's got the gold Michael
Kors it here and it's got these like
rose gold detailing things underneath
but I just literally love it so much and
all the detailing go around to the back
and it's just so so pretty and it's I
don't know I just love it and it's so
big as well which is perfect for six
form it doesn't have a long strap it
does just have the two handles but I'm
fine with that because I actually just
wanted to carry on my shoulder this year
because every I do have one that goes on
my side but now I'm kind of growing up a
little bit more one is like a handbag
type one so I do love this it has all
gold detailing as well and is it under
so nicely so yeah this is oh my god it's
so heavy everything I have inside I'm
just going to start pulling out things
one by one so
first thing I have is a folder so I will
actually have three folders and three
notebooks because I'm planning on taking
three a levels I just put one out going
looks really heavy and I however know
how heavy it was actually kind of
panicking now if you do want to see
where I put everything from it you can
go up my back to school wall which it
again we link down below and on screen
together I have a folder and then I do
have the matching wire notebook I just
got black ones just kind of like making
us in a bit more easier and simple so I
haven't folded and in notebooks for each
subject that I'm going to do again don't
also if I'm doing get operation arrays
that position but I'm still kind of like
deciding on it but yes so I have a
notebook and a folder for each subject I
then have my huge big screams planner
thing and this is basically a huge
planner which is really cool actually
for most different compartments in it
you guys can see how nice this is and if
you do want to see where I got it from
again what about school but this is so
handy especially because at six full
Morrissey I think I'm going to have a
lot of the time is that I like doing
stuff and I'm going to have to keep on
top of that whilst doing YouTube because
obviously I'm carrying on with YouTube
that's just a given like there's no way
I'm stopping YouTube so this is
basically just to help plan my life and
organize YouTube and sixth form at the
moment I've been using it since summer
and it's so good I love having a planner
I don't know why I never had one before
next in at my bag oh okay so I have my
iPad now I'm actually in a start taking
my iPad to school this year either my
iPad or my laptop depending on what I
needed for that day you can exactly plan
on taking photos photography and film so
I thought I'd need or take my iPads
because it would just be easier than
anything you can work on it or if I need
to watch videos or movies I can use this
and if I just have free time I guess
I'll just use my iPad so yeah I'm going
to start taking about iPad to school
with me and it's iPad Mini as well I got
it for Christmas and it's gold which I
liked it matches but I actually do need
to get K to it because it's a little bit
scratched but yeah this also has my name
on it if I saw princess at the top so
the to love it so I'm treating this like
a haul and not like a what's in my
school bag next I have my pencil case
and this is a marble pencil case from
Primark
I recently showed this in a court of our
logging channel
like she loved this so much or when you
take this tag off but when you open it I
basically have all of my stationery
ready to go again I show you what I got
away back to school haul but I've got my
highlighters pencils pens rubbers
sharpness everything in there and I love
my pencil page it's a lot like more
organized than last year and it had a
clear one last year
I'm so happy I've got this marble one
but yeah this was from Primark
then I had my little lunch box now I
don't really know what I'm going to
taking for lunch every day because I
don't yet know my hours like for six
form or whatever so this is just a
little box but a hard moment is tiny
because I'm planning on going a little
bit more healthy so I want to be having
like fruit salads and then I'll just
take a few extra things that will be
loose in my bag but this is basically
just a little Tupperware pot that mum
bought probably from somewhere around or
something nowhere expensive but you're
probably just going to have like salad
or fruit salad or something other ways
lines in this I then have my water
bottle and again it's literally just one
from Aldi or little I'm not going to buy
like a water bottle I'll just take a
bowl water out the fridge everyday
this sort is so good I'm actually going
to have a bit right now it's so nice
it's called Carrick Glen spring water
still definitely recommend it water
water but it is so good so I will be
taking about a visit it for everyday or
both you just reuse the bottle and fill
it up I want to be taking off around the
bottle of water does it really matter to
you about what the water bottle looks
like to be honest I just defer taking
ones like this so when they get a bit
dirty if you just chatting away and get
a new one then I have my earphones and
these are very tangled right now but
these are the ones of the iPhone 7 and
I'm actually debating I think I need to
get some normal ones like the ones are
just a normal headphone jack in because
if I need them for a computer or like my
iPad or something I'm going to need
other ones so these are just the ones
for my phone which are ridiculously
tangled initially any of my friends know
me I always have tangled arrows and
enemy takes pity on me because all my if
I've always tangled yes I just have my
tangled earphones which go with my phone
which is also in here can we just talk
about how cool this case is as well so
it says my name was encased afire they
actually recently sent me it I don't
know a lot of people to saying they're
dangerous but I really like it
my name on it and it's all sparkly all
the gifts it goes everywhere and I
thought this is really cute so obviously
my phone's rose gold so like on top the
silver looks really nice actually that's
better than gold which i think is like
kind of good but yeah so I would love
that and then you can pop the earphones
and there and you're good to go
even though phones have actually been
banned that after all I don't know if
it's a sixth form but they have been to
the dollar school so hopefully not forum
six launder yeah that's my little phone
case and my earphone so thank you so
much to take slice and give me this
phone case I love it
finally the last thing I have is a
makeup bag and it's the author from
Primark it's gold and white marble which
I really like and kind of a blacks it
and this basically is going to have
things like perfume deodorant lip balm
everything like that but at the moment
she's got my Beauty Blender it's got a
few brushes it's got a top up of that
lip color that I'm gonna wear definitely
think I'm going to wear this six form
it's just got a mascara in here and then
it also got my nip and fat highlighting
palette if you guys do want to see a
makeup tutorial make sure you let me
know down below and I will 100% do a
makeup tutorial for you but yeah I'm
just going to keep things like beauty
items in here because it's actually
quite big and every year I say it can
I'm going to have a juicy thing like in
my bag but this year I actually have a
bag big enough to be able to do that so
yeah definitely I'm going to be keeping
kind of like makeup bags and everything
like that in there so yeah that is
basically everything or for bottles in
my school bag I'm really trying to think
like have I forgot something I really
don't think I have but obviously I know
you pee anymore so I want you to take my
PE kit but obviously all have a
different folders different notebooks
everything like that and I'll probably
have to get a bigger lunch rocks because
I dunno taking quite a bit for lunch
admittedly so yeah that is everything so
if you do want to get my bag as well I
got it from Vista village it's a local
cause one it was actually on like I did
about last season it was like last
chance to buy so I actually was pretty
lucky when I got it it was quite pricey
it was 95 pounds but for me I needed a
really strong bag and I'm actually going
to use this and one of the ways that
London and everything as well so I'm not
just going to be using this for school
I'm going to be using it for kind of
like others
and day trips out seeing that was
expensive to me it was worth it because
I was it for a long time I saved up for
it because that is the end of today's
video I really hope you enjoyed it made
sure to come back on my channel I last
Thursday at around 12 p.m.
