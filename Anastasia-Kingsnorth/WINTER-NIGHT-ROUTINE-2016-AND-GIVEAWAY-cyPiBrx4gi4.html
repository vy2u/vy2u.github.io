and I'm going to be doing my Christmas
night routine for 2016 but I don't know
about you but I love Christmas and when
I say love I mean absolute adore
literally Christmas is one of my
favorite times of the year and it's the
time where I feel like it's perfect for
filming night routines today I thought I
would do my Christmas night routine and
just show you what I get up to on a
typical Sunday evening in as I often get
asked what I do on my upload day so I
thought this would be a really good
video to film and also stay into the end
because there may or may not be a pretty
good giveaway so yeah I hope in jewelry
oh I haven't let's get started so
starting off my winter night routine I
will come home from wherever I have been
so today I was actually just in Milton
Keynes shopping and then I had a
Starbucks come home with me so you know
I just filmed some classic Starbucks
clips and I took some photos of it for
Instagram so look out for that photo my
Instagram my Instagram will be linked in
the description box down below so once I
am officially home I will come in just
put my drink down take my coat off
and just chill out and I tend to sit on
my phone and check social media for a
good hour to you know it's an addiction
everybody about a lot of people do it
and because I've been out all day I
hadn't really checked so make sure you
follow my Instagram and Twitter links
are on the screen
I then also add things to my snapchat
story because I don't day vlog which yes
I am considering doing but because I
don't daily vlog I add things to my
snapchat story and vlog on there instead
so make sure you got over ty cetera and
add me that was my screen code Barker
thing so you can scan that on the screen
or you can just add me by username then
I will then take to YouTube and Netflix
and I will just sit there do some
catching up on some work things that I
need to do and everything like that just
basically catch up on what I've missed
throughout the day and I've recently
been loving putting this fireplace on on
YouTube it laughter around three hours
and it's so Christmasy then I would like
some candles this one is just from bnm
and it's literally like a Bath &amp;amp; Body
Works candle it smells so good it
literally filled the room better than
the Yankee candle in my opinion so I
would definitely recommend you pick some
of these up it's then time to pick out
some product for my Pantha evening so I
was just smelling at the body shop
things that I have in the Christmas
range and my new lush bits that I picked
up that day so in the end I decided to
pick the body shop frosted cranberry
body butter and they sent me this with
my name on it's so cute and the body
shop body butters are absolutely
incredible I then just chose to use
candy mounting and melting marshmallow
moment from lush you can't go wrong with
a bit of lush at Christmas time it's
literally the best thing ever and then
in the middle of filming this video I
had a boo hoo delivery so just thought
I'd show you what I got like a mini haul
I got this a black backpack because I
really needed a backpack for when I go
on day trips out to London or YouTube
trips I then also bought a new purse as
well because I needed a new purse to go
with my new bag and it was on sale for
six pounds so I really liked that then I
picked up this blue and white stripe
t-shirt which I wore quite a lot
recently actually it's so nice and then
I picked up these trainers as I needed
some new trainers for P slash going out
when I don't want to wear my gazelles
which I have so that's what I got from
boohoo it's then time to take my makeup
off so I'll just use the Garnier
micellar water just to wipe all of her
makeup off as you can see it's actually
pretty good and it wipes my eyeshadow
off even though I use primer pretty much
is straight away
and then once I've done that I will use
the Nippon fab spot clearer stick thingy
it's really really good the team spots
app it's really good and I just pop this
on all of my spots just to not
necessarily get rid of them but to just
you know lower their appearance a little
bit then it's time for my bath so as you
do you like some candles I always do
this I get a bath and then I use the
body shop vanilla chai shower gel and
body scrub this is my favorite Christmas
scent of all time I genuinely love it
then I just popped with my lush products
in and I decided to use the magic wand
as well as I still had a little bit left
so I just swirled it around in the bath
as you do love a good pink bath from
lush literally one of the best things
ever so once I had done that I then just
kind of relaxed didn't really do much in
the bath just relax and sit on my phone
and wash my hair using the Garnier
ultimate blend which is really good so
then one time out the bath I just
brushed all my hair out as it was so
naughty and I probably should have used
a tangle teezer to do this instead of
this hair brush but I got there in the
end
and once I had done that I just used
this overnight skin serum from good
things I often talk about good things in
my videos they send a notice after my pa
box and it's really good I would
definitely recommend you buy it
I really like this it's helped lower the
redness of my skin recently
it is then time to just kind of chill
out and sit on my laptop for a little
while so all I did was sat on to Netflix
and I've recently been catching up on
Pretty Little Liars and I'm a celebrity
I am a servant who's finished by the
time this goes up but at the moment it's
like at the peak of where people are
starting to leave so I am absolutely
loving it and I'll also just sit on my
phone and finally do my last final catch
up on social media before I head off to
bed but genuinely this is like literally
my night routine I do this on a Sunday
night every time I upload a video and I
would do this all throughout the day as
well as doing schoolwork like bits and
bobs and homework and revision in and
out this but that is basically my winter
night routine so that is the end of my
video I really hope you enjoyed it let
me know if you by giving a huge thumbs
up but before we in the video I actually
