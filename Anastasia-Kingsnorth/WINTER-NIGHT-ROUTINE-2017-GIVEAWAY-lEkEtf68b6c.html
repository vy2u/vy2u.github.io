I really hope you guys enjoy and let's
just get into the video the first thing
I do when I come in from my day is just
put my back down get my camera out
because you know logging life get my
phone out and then just chill on my bed
I always hang my coat up as well because
I've got to keep my room tidy so once
I've done that I board you take my shoes
off get ready
get ready you know I mean yeah unready
to our point and then just chill on my
bed you guys know I'm addicted to social
media I love it so much
so our first of all probably check
Instagram Instagram is kind of my
favorite social media I would say I
literally love posting on there for you
guys so there is my Instagram if you
would like to follow it and then
obviously keep tracking Instagram then
you move on to a snapchat which again is
another one of my favorite social medias
I always keep you guys updated on there
so if you haven't got me on snapchat
already definitely go and add me and my
username is on screen right now I always
just post silly things to keep you guys
updated and you know basically just add
me on snapchat I've also got to keep up
with everything on Twitter as well so
finally I will go and check Twitter
again my username is on screen if you
would like to go and follow me you know
there's some juicy stuff on Twitter so
definitely worth dropping a follow over
there so once I've done that I will then
go onto YouTube catch up with my
subscription box I'm obsessed with
watching Ellen DeGeneres at the moment
I've been obsessed with a fad ages but I
just love watching her and then
obviously vlogmas so i will keep you
guys at day through what I'm doing and
blog the two white bits in the back of
my camera are white tack because my
camera screen fell off right before
vlogmas so that's why I've got white
tack on the back of my camera how it
just got random stuff stuck on it so
then once I've done that I'll pop my
vlog camera down and put my phone down
and choose my things that ready for my
pamper Bartha later I always do this is
the classic winter night for me
everybody is so annoyed in my vlogmas
because I'm constantly having bath
so I'll just probably use like a lush
bath on this one is called sweater and
it's romney christmas 2017 collection
and then i'll pick a body milk out and
then i will go into my next drawer I do
have a makeup collection it by the way
if you do want to see these drawers in
depth I go all through them and I'll
pick a face mask a hair mask a lip balm
baster basically anything I need for a
proper pamper evening and then I'll head
on over into the bathroom where I'll
start to run my bath just add some
bubbles in you know and then here is the
most amazing lush bath bomb ever so I
think this is called sweat
obviously looks like a Christmas sweater
and just how beautiful is it is one of
these slow fizzing one so you know you
get your money worth out of it's really
nice to look at it is about four pounds
fifty but the bath goes such a beautiful
color and honestly like not only is it
so photogenic but it's actually a
perfect to get in it was just so so nice
I felt so pampered then I want to wash
my hair while I was in there so I used
my red Ken diamonds oil blow dry shampoo
as I've recently dyed my hair on very
which I also did a video on I wanted to
keep it in really good condition so I
used that and then I do switch between
touch of silver as well which I do show
you guys here are ut touch of silver
conditioner but occasionally I also do
use a shampoo as well not on the top of
my hair just on the bottom and then I
will go ahead and wash my body or use it
the bath and Bodyworks a marshmallow
pumpkin latte shower gel and body scrub
you can see it in the back left hand
corner there it's so good I ordered it
off eBay I did a bath and Bodyworks haul
as well if you guys do want to see that
then once I've done that it's time for
skincare so I just applied a Garnier
moisturizer to my face I have really
oily skin and this is a oil balancing
moisturizer so it's actually really good
and then I just popped a little bit of
my EOS strawberry sorbet lip balm on
just as my lips are quite dry when I get
out the bath and this kind of just
completes my skincare routine
Merry Christmas then it's time for me to
go downstairs and spend some time with
my family so I live with my mother and
little brother so I just basically play
some games with them me and Atticus
actually made some brownie it one of the
days of my vlogmas so we just sat and
have some of that which was so good I
love brownies so much the Betty Crocker
fudge brownie go get you some from
Tesco's like to powder box it's
absolutely amazing so once I finished
eating my brownie and we finished having
a chat you know how it is I will grab
some more snacks go upstairs and light
some candles her my Christmas lights on
basically get ready for a really cozy
evening and I will get ready to watch
some movies so I've got my Dairy Milk
I've got my cabbage fingers and I took
to Netflix Netflix have such good movies
at the moment they recently added
bridesmaids which I know isn't a
Christmas movie but I love it but they
do have a ton of Christmas movies I
don't know if they've got the Grinch but
the Grinch is hands-down my favorite one
and then Cabarita brought out these
snowy fingers and how cool are these
they're half white chocolate half milk
chocolate anyway I'm always promoting
food I need to stop once I've done that
I will basically fall asleep to watching
my movie and that is where my night will
end so that's basically my winter night
routine so that is the end of this video
