know this isn't being uploaded on
Christmas Day but it's a Boxing Day now
I'm going to say Merry Christmas to you
all I hope you had an amazing Christmas
and I hope you all got what you wanted
and you spent time with your family and
had a really good time so today I'm
going to be doing the most requested
video ever this Christmas and this is
the what I got for Christmas 2014 but
I'm just gonna throw a quick disclaimer
out there that I'm not trying to brag at
all you know that I this I just wanted
to do this video because I love sharing
like what I got because I love watching
these type of videos I'm not trying to
brag I'm so so grateful for everything
that I got I don't know I got so much
but seriously I'm so grateful for it all
so please don't think that I'm not
because I seriously am and I know that
all of you guys are appreciative of what
you got or if you didn't get anything
and if you don't celebrate it I'm really
sorry that this video made me not be to
your taste but I still hope you enjoy
anyway and let's get started I also
forgot to mention that this is a
collaboration video with Lilly and
Keisha so of course you know me their
channels are they're both amazing
channels so make sure you go and check
their video out once you have watched
this video so I'm gonna start off with
the two things I actually can't show you
because my dad got me them and my dad
got me a new tripod and studio light so
he got me the vel Von D f55 one acai
bowl mix up their tripod I needed a
black tripod and then I just used my old
iPad attachment on that and then he just
got me the same studio light as I had
before because basically when I was
filming a video with Molly mine and
knocked it over and it fell into a
candle and it burnt a hole in it so I
had to film with a big hole like coming
out on my tripod but not trying for no
supper studio light but now everything's
fixed because he got me a new one so I'm
really grateful for all that stuff so
thank you so much so now I'm gonna do
what my mom taught me so the first thing
she got me was that there's a huge soap
and glory set so heavy so she got me
this set what makes my lighting go awful
but it's called the soap &amp;amp; Glory
Supremes and it comes with cozy socks
the righteous butter swear with your
life clean army Hill genius
and food and I'm not sure how much this
was but I'm really appreciative that I
got this because look at it it's like
the most amazing set ever and it just
comes in this white pink box and then on
the back it's just pastel pink and I'll
definitely keep this box because I'm
just really grateful for it and I put
this on my Christmas text and I'm so
happy that I got it because it's so
worth the money and yeah I just really
need to stop her from my soap and glory
so thank you for that mom and then got
me a load of books at the first one she
got me reservist girl online I actually
had this early I was allowed to have
this early because she knew how much I
wanted to read it so I've already
started reading it and I actually got a

three and it's such a good book I'm so
proud of Zoey it's amazing and I'm also

I just wanted loads of different pages
to do really excited to do this book I'm
just excited she also got me the book I
wanted so bad and this is the Lauren
Conrad book of beauty so I have wanted
this
