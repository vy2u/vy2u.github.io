am going to be doing my white board for
Christmas 2015 edition quick sidenote
I'm sorry about my voice I lost it for
literally the whole week and today is
Christmas and I'm finally starting to
get it back I'd kind of like a Christmas
present so I'm really sorry if it sounds
a bit quirky and annoying but I'm trying
my best for it not to but yeah just have
to get it out of the way so today are we
doing a what I got for Christmas and I'm
so excited about this because I got the
best Christmas present and I'm so so
grateful and I was not expecting what I
got like genuinely I'm really really
grateful for I have and I actually
cannot quite believe it so I'm not
trying to brag or boast in any way shape
or form you guys know that I'm actually
just showing you what I got for
Christmas because a lot of youtubers do
this at Christmastime and I thought it
would be quite a nice video to do so I
hope you enjoy the video and let's get
started so I'm gonna start off with my
main present which my mom got me and I
kind of hinted that I wanted these
throughout the year but she was just
like oh yeah yeah whatever because we
already have some and basically they are
ghd's and she got me the Arctic gold
pear I really really wanted these me and
my mom share some already they were
limited edition about seven years ago
which means they are really on its way
out like they are really about
straightness now because they take hours
like if you want to get your head dead
straight you'll have to take about an
hour but these I've straightened my hair
this morning just like the top layer and
it done it in like 30 seconds
and oh my god they are beautiful they
just have like the gold dots and then
silver detailing and they're called
Arctic gold and they came in their bag
was like a heatproof matte and
everything but I love these so much and
I cannot believe that I got them so
thank you so much mom this literally
made my Christmas when I opened them
because I really really wanted those oh
thank you so that was kind of my main
prison that my mom got me and then I
kind of got like a lot of littler bits
if that makes any sense so the first
thing I thought was just open glory set

this as it came with a smoothie style
hand food so she got me this and I love
it so thank you mom for that I cannot
wait to use this and she also got me

which i wasn't expecting as she wrapped
it up in the weirdest shape but she got

expecting it because i'm i'm always says
to me oh you have so many candles you

and i do burn them just at a very slow
pace Oh sounds amazing I'm actually got
my little Soviet cookie burning in the
background so I know have this one to
burn you that also picked me up some
stuff from Gaby's range at Primark she
recently bought out only stage for me
range so she picked me up the pencil set
which comes with six little pencils and
they're gray and like as techy colorful
I really really like them and they were
2 pounds I think because I chose them
and then she also picked me up the
sparkling like no sparkle like a diamond
little pencil part and I'm just gonna
put that in the background over there
with the pencils in because I thought
that would look really really cute so
yeah thank you month Allah I love them

bits which I love so the first thing she
got me is high-end and it's for NARS and
she got me the NARS radiant creamy
