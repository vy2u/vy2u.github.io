going to be doing a what is in my bag so
we're kind of in the season where we're
in the middle of like going from spring
into summer now and I thought it was
time to get a new bag it's actually a
bag that I've had my eye on for a very
long time so I thought I would do an
updated what is in my bag I love them in
these videos and since I have a new bag
I'm fluent be really exciting to do one
and yeah I'm acting pretty excited to do
this video I don't know why so the bag I
actually have is from Topshop and it is
a little black Topshop tote type bag so
I'm sorry digit husky little side
squares and then just here it says
Topshop it has two zips it has an inner
pocket that is removable and it has two
straps here as well as a long strap this
was 36 pounds from Topshop but it's made
a rule ever and it's very very good
quality
so I'm going to start off with the
little zip pocket at the front so in the
zip pocket at the front I just have my
earphones it's actually pretty tangled
at the moment these are just normal
Apple in fact I actually untangled these
this morning and now they're like this
but these are just normal Apple
earphones and if I bring my iPod shuffle
out with me to listen to music on in the
car then that will also go in there but
I don't have that in my bag at the
moment so in the left side pocket or
like the left side of the bag I keep my
pass and this is my purse it's from new
look it's just a kind of lie lucky color
with golden undertone underneath with
like hexagons are little dots and
stripes and then I just have I don't
really have anything in this at the
moment because I only got this purse
earlier on today but when I've like got
more stuff in it it will look more like
my purse but I absolutely love this
purse and it's just a new look on the
right side of my bag I keep my phone and
I just have the white iPhone 4s I'm
actually gonna be upgrading soon because
I think I might upgrade isn't about
August or September time but my phone's
actually been so good recently it's
starting to kind of break now but yeah
that's my phone in there also keep my
hairbrush in that compartment because
it's pretty big and roomy and I'm
molting everywhere and this is just a
black tangle teezer which i think was
from like amazon and that's part as well
I also have some sunglasses so these
ones are from Primark and they have a
slight cat eye with an ombre lens which
are really really pretty and these were
only 150 and I actually love these so
now into the zip pocket of my bag I kind
of keep all of my beauty bits so it does
button out which I really like because
if I need to take something that is a
bit bigger just like maybe my camera or
anything like that I have space for it
so the first thing I keep in there with
my benefit perfume and this is a mini
and this one is ring my Bella and I love
this one it smells so good it's kind of
purply based and I'll just show you I
keep it in the box it doesn't leak but
it has I could flow really pattern and
it says ring my bell on the front and
all the detailing is gold and you just
take the lid off I can't you can get it
off because of my plaster I slice my
finger open
you know oh that smells so good and you
just like dab that oops
onto your wrist and it's really really
nice I then keep my like blusher will
only think at the time which today is
the Milani illuminating face powder
because I have that on at the moment and
it feels really good so I just carry
that around to top up this is also a
permanent for my bag and it is the mini
benefit they're real mascara I actually
purposely got this for my new bag so I
don't have to always take out a
different mascara from my drawers I just
prefer to have one in there all the time
so this is just a mini they're real and
the final thing I keep in my bag is a
hand sanitizer and this one is from Bath
&amp;amp; Body Works and it's called vanilla
berry sorbet and this is just a light
pink con with blue dots and it smells
like berries and strawberries and it's
really really nice so I know this is
basically it's very similar to what I
keep in my other what's in my bag videos
but I really wanted to do an updated
want to show you some of the new bits
that I have in it and just to keep you
updated to what I'm going to be carrying
around in the summer in the summer time
it will probably be a bit more in the
summer time because I'll probably have
to bring different makeup items with me
or maybe put like a jacket in there or
anything but this is basically what I
have in my bag at the moment I really
hope you enjoyed the video let me know

likes on every single video now if you
