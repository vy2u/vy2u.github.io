back and I'm going to doing a wash it in
my bag automat 2016 now I recently got a
new handbag and I am like a slightly
obsessed with it so I thought I would
show you what I keep in it but before I
actually show you what I keep in my
handbag I have some really really
excited to talk about which I don't know
if you guys actually know if you don't
find me on social media but basically I
have been working with Claire's
accessories I'm pretty sure you only
what the shop is they're based worldwide
and I was lucky enough to work with them
to pick out my handbag essentials as if
you go into Claire stores you will see
my face on top of the stand and
underneath will be all of the perks that
I picked so you can go and buy the perks
as headphones phone cases makeup sponges
necklaces jewelry makeup bags everything
like that I'm so grateful to be able to
do this and I can't wait to see what you
guys get from it so tweet me pictures
instagramming pictures send me snapchats
everything like that all of my social
medias are down below but it's so so
excited so thank you for the opportunity
and thank you Claire's for working with
me because literally it's been a dream
come true yeah without further ado I'm
just going to get into what I keep in my
actual handbag so my handbag is from
Topshop and it's a recent purchase and
I'm in love with it and it's just this
black one here it kind of looks like
what I usually use as a school bag in
all honesty but it's a bit too small for
a school bag but then I think it's
perfect size for a handbag so it's just
black as I said it just looks like this
it has gorgeous like gold detailing here
and then it's just black on the back and
inside it kind of has its like brown
snake skin pattern it also has
adjustment for side like a long handle
but I justified using this handle as the
side strap was really long I just look
stupid on me so we're just gonna stick
with these handles but it was only 28
pounds which to me is absolutely amazing
for Topshop anyway because normally I
pay like 40 pounds per Topshop so 12
pound cheaper I love it without further
ado I was going to get
what I have in my bag because apparently
I have quite a lot I'm going to start
off with the absolute basic my purse
this purse is just your new look it's
like this light if you color and it has
like copper undertones underneath it I
just have normal things that you have in
a purse debit card money card apparently
about 100 train tickets and yeah that's
basically all I have in my purse just
usual stuff but I think I want to get a
new purse or more like autumnal one
because this is quite like summery
springy and dr. I then of course have my
phone and at the moment I just have this
cute little cactus case on it which I
personalized on Lila lab and then I just
have my iPhone it smashed at the moment
which I'm really sad about I'm
definitely looking at upgrading to the
iPhone 7 though because this phone is
breaking like it's dying at like 40% so
go me yeah go following all my social
medias if you haven't already I'll put
them on screen and in the description so
go follow me there now which is probably
like the most stupidest things have in
my bag but now because my back is bigger
I can take this out with me and it's
basically like my little mini binder I
got this entirely in America and I've
been obsessed with it since so I just
have like this binder which is your
target is copper on the side and then
you could buy like all of the inserts
for it so I have like those are these
are copper inserts and like this Brown
little like to-do lists and yeah this is
so much in here like calendars planners
everything like that I literally like
plan my days out in here it's just so
handy to keep track of everything and
yeah keep that in there I think I paid
like three dollars for the binder three
dollars for the insert a dollar for the
clips and a dollar for the notebook so
so inexpensive target please come to
England because it would be the best
thing that ever happened to me I then
also keep some sort of water bottle but
at the moment I just have my boxed water
this is the only water bottle I have in
the house at the moment but I tend to
just take whatever one I have I got this
one from Target in America as well and I
love this so much
I saw them plastered on Tumblr Pinterest
and everywhere like that and I walked
into Target and it was there for a
dollar
I was like you know what we're getting
that I then just have my phone
charger which is like a normal one with
like a copper lead because copper obsess
and I also fill up my phone dies a lot
because as I said it does die so
ridiculous at 30% so always keep a spare
charge in my bag probably would be more
practical to get like a portable charger
something like that and not one I
actually require a plug for stupid and
Sager but keep this in my bag I then
also have some headphones and these are
my friends headphones from friends I
love these so much they're just like the
rose gold ones and the sound quality is
amazing like absolutely amazing and I
just plug these into my phone or my
laptop or whatever I have with me that
day and yeah I love these these were
about 100 pounds but I feel like if
you're a youtuber or if you like need
good headphones like I don't these are
good ones to go for and then of course I
keep serving Beauty bits in my bag so I
just have my bath and Bodyworks
marshmallow pumpkin latte body cream but
I actually use it as a hand cream
because it smells so good oh my god
literally if you can go to a Bath &amp;amp; Body
Works or find it online somewhere get
this scent it's amazing I cannot either
and to match that I have the marketer
pumpkin latte fragrance mist which again
is also one of my favorite things ever
oh my gosh the scent is just perfect for
autumn and it just I don't know it makes
me feel like it's autumn matches my
little pumpkin over there as well I also
have to keep a hand sanitizer in my bags
at the moment I have the Bath &amp;amp; Body
Works
warm vanilla sugar one this is like the
new version of it like the bottle and it
smells so good this is like really
autumn and all this is like the only
automata one they had in the shop and I
when I really wanted the one to match my
lotion and cream but they didn't have it
I got this one
nevertheless though I still love this
and I ran my hand for the times that I
tend to keep a little hair bobbin as
well just in case because you always
need a hair bubble and then you really
don't have one you're like great and
finally in the zip pocket I keep some
makeup items so I always keep the
mascara because I love to top up my
mascara throughout the day just in case
my eyelashes tend to like drop a bit I
like taking a bit like thicker blacker
you know the drill then I have my two
favorite lip products which are the Too
Faced melted matte in a child star and
my Kylie Jenner matte
with lipstick in candy cane I wear candy
cane so much this is actually basically
ran out now I don't really have any more
users out of it so I'm gonna have to get
anyone because I love it so much and
then I've always used this to do like an
ombre lip with I don't know I just love
them but that is basically everything in
my bag my bag is how completely empty I
really hope you enjoy this video I love
doing like what
in my videos I find them really fun to
watch you didn't do this video make sure
to give it a huge thumbs up and let's
see if we can smash 10,000 likes because
last video got 14,000 likes so I know
you can start 10,000 but yeah I love you
all so so much and I'll see you in my
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
