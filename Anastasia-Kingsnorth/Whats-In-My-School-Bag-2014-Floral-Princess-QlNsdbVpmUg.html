in my school bag for summer 2014 so
every time I mention this video all of
you get so excited because I know how
much you've wanted this so I just
decided that I'm going to do it now
because you wanted it so bad and I'm
actually kind of excited to go back to
school because I get to see my friends
again even though my toes a bit
different so I move on to a different
block I'm still pretty much excited to
go back to school and I've got
everything sorted now so I fit I'm
feeling ready to go back I don't go back
till next Thursday but I'm feeling ready
so if you want to see what I have in my
school bag then carry on watching oh
this is my school bag it is a big black
one from new look I showed it in my
primer call yesterday and I don't know
why but I just seriously fell in love
with this bag I'm going to try and get
it like a long strap to put on it
because I think I'll be easier but this
is what it looks like it's just big and
black and then it has these like
see-through side parts as I think set it
off with gold detailing and then it just
has a button which is going to be kind
of annoying if it rains but we're gonna
have to deal with that when it comes to
it but yeah this is 20 powerful new look
and I absolutely love it so so much
let's just get started to what I have
inside so the first thing I have is a
water bottle I showed this in my haul
and it just stays to stemmer
pink and blue one this is not done in a
staff like two pounds and mum was like
to get that so always need a water
bottle so I keep that in there have a
notebook which again I showed in my haul
I also go if you want to say I don't
have my catechism folder or pencil case
yet because they still haven't come but
I wanted to film it anyway so yeah this
is my notebook I have it's just like a
gray retro lined notebook and yeah I
really like this it's like 50 P from
home bargains which is amazing then have
some girly things which we all need and
then I have some tissues and these are
just the cactus
tissues this pack of 10 and their four
ply they are feeling good and these were
95 P from the Catechism shop of my phone
and I couldn't leave the house without
my phone I always have to have this with
me we are on our phones at school just
not in class and we have them at break
lunch before whenever but um yeah I just
take my phone with me
iPhone 4s if you want to see what's in
my know what's on my iPhone then let me
know because I will do an updated one
but yeah take my phone with me I have my
hair brush and this is just a tangle
teezer it's really like discussing at
the moment so don't look at that but
yeah I'm going to clean it out before I
go to school but I always keep this in
my bag because I always get naughty hair
because of the wind or it rained and you
always need a hairbrush
so tangle teezer is the best one I think
and then have a bath or Body Works hand
sanitizer so this is the pocket back in
I love s'mores and this is like the
first ever pocket back I got and then I
didn't want to use it much because it
was like sacred to me but now I'm going
to start using it as I thought it kind
of like match to my bag I don't know I'm
going to get a pink one but yeah it
smells so so good love the smell of fish
so much it's just the best please get
this pocket back and we can be matching
because she's so good my purse so I
don't take my purse every day to school
I'm just going to be taking this
Sunday's because I get free school
dinners so I don't have to like take
money to school or anything but I take
money if I want to get something at
right time so I'll probably just take
this on days where I'm either going into
town after school or doing something
after school which I need money for or I
will take it when I'm going to get
something at break and then have my
calculator and this is nobody gonna fit
in my pencil case and there's no side
pocket so I just have to like keep it
out loose in my bag and I wanted to get
the pink one so bad but I chucked it
away so I took three one but ya feel
quite dark but it's okay I don't need to
use it much also on Sundays I would have
my peek in my bag but that is I need
Sundays and I don't know my timetable
for school yet so I don't know what I'm
going to taking that but yeah my peak is
just a white top blue short and then I
have some like Nike trainers so this is
going to be my beauty bag for school but
for the purpose of this video I've
actually put my station mean front part
because again my pairs of visa
pain and it probably won't come for a
couple of days so I just wanted to like
put it in here so I've just got like my
macaroon rubber and pastel sharpies and
tractor mask compass ruler tip X just
all of my station which I'm going to be
taking in there but I will transfer it
over to my Kathy's and pencil case when
it comes and add the other bits in but
if you want to see like all my
stationery check out my back to school
haul then in the back pocket I have all
of my beauty things for school so the
first thing I have in these and these
are the Real Techniques travel minis so
my mum got me these when I went to
Milton Keynes because I always want to
take brushes to school but I find that
the real techniques like normal sized
ones are way too big to fit in my school
bag they take up too much room and it's
not necessary but I thought this mini
set was great for back-to-school and it
comes with a mini like powder or blush
brush a mini eyeshadow brush and mini
pointed foundation brush and I've really
been loving the point foundation brush
at the moment like the full size so I've
got those to take school and they were
like eight pounds from superdrug you can
see like I'm going to be taking the
benefit fake up because it's really
light and it's very hydrating so I
thought to be perfect and then to set
that I'm going to taking the Rimmel
clear complexion powder and my final
three items are first of all a baby lips
and this is just the baby lips in
intense care because I thought this was
leaving the better one left best one to
take to school and then the Maybelline
big eyes rebel black mascara because it
has like to end so it's on it'd be
really handy like I love the ones on
both of these ends are so so so good got
this on today and I love it so even
though it's just meant to be my school
mascara but still not that I'm taking
that and then I'm going to be taking my
Tanya burr lip gloss in just peachy
because I thought like a nude lip color
would be quite nice for school and if it
just comes off then I can just hop up
throughout the day now is everything
that I'm going to be kicking me in my
school bag I am completely aware that I
don't know what I'm going to be needing
to take and this is just what I think
I'm going to need to take obviously I
will have a folder and a pencil case in
there but these are just the things that
I think I need for going up to unite I
guess I'll find out what I need on the
same day the day way back but they do
supply books and planners and that is
why I don't have that in there but if
you enjoyed it please give a big thumbs
up and let me know some other videos you
want me to do because I always

thanks for watching thumbs up if you
enjoyed and don't forget subscribe bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
