going to be doing a back-to-school what
is in my school bag so I really wanted
to do a proper back to school series
this year just like I did last year make
sure you go and watch those videos as
well because they are absolutely
hilarious and literally fetus and a
seizure so I was going to put up a
what's in my small bag literally
straight after a back to school haul but
I thought the videos would have been
very very similar as I've shown most of
the stuff in my haul and it basically
would have just been a repetitive video
so I thought that I would wait a few
videos where does I have a bit more
things or stuff and then show you I am
really excited to do this video because
it is actually been very very requested
which I didn't think it would be but it
has been and I really have now I think
two weeks left of school around two
weeks whereas a summer holiday gone I do
not know but yeah I only have about two
weeks after school now so thought I'd
get this video up and most of my videos
will be back to school videos in this at
all period of time so I hope you join a
video and let's get started so before I
show you all of my school bag and
everything I'm just going to tell you
about a few things so I'm going to be
getting but I don't actually have with
me at moment so the first thing is a
lunchbox the lunchbox I'm going to be
getting is one from happy Jackson
I ordered it like it just hasn't came
yet I've got the pink and white one and
it says something about healthy snacks
on it I will link it down below just in
case we do want to go and buy that or
just to have a look at it it is
basically a rectangular plastic box
white on the bottom pink on the top and
you just lift the lid off and it has a
cute little like elastic band around it
to hold them together and it is adorable
and I think I paid $7.99 for that and
the quality of lunchbox I thought that
was pretty good I will then also have a
water bottle and I'm going to be having
a Fiji water bottle but I'm just going
to get this from Waitrose like a day or
two before school as I don't really need
to keep that in my bag right now and
then on Sundays I will also have my PE
kit in there I think that will only be
once a week as I haven't
p for GCSE and while I'm on topic of
GCSEs I always get asked what I'm taking
so because I have to take triple science
I only got to pick three so I am taking
art textiles and history I'm takin that
art I don't know what it's called I want
to say fine art but I don't know if it
is yes it is fine actually it's not
applied I'm thinking find out where like
you don't get told what to do you kind
of do your own thing and I work much
better that way and I think that's
everything that I will be keeping in my
bag I don't have with me now if it's not
I'll just put at the end but that's what
I can think of off the top of my head
right now so now I'm going to show you
what I have in my bag and what that
actually is so basically I have this
huge black bag from H&amp;amp;M it is basically
proper solid like it's really solid it
is a huge huge black rectangular bag
with these like golden details and it
just has a huge zip with a ton of
pockets in it is so so big and it also
has a long strap as well so last year my
school bag didn't have a zip so anybody
can look in it and it didn't have a long
strap so I had to carry it on my arm and
on my shoulder so this year I went for
the two options that I didn't really
have my last bag so yeah I'm really
excited about that and you can also take
this long strap off which I'm very happy
about because sometimes you just don't
want it on there you can get a bit
annoying really but yeah this is such a
big bag and you can actually like
unbuttoned the sides and it will turn it
into an even bigger bag but personally I
don't need to do that yet maybe what on
PE days I might have to but at the
moment I don't have to do that and this
bag was from H&amp;amp;M and it was meant to be
40 pounds but it was not down to 30
pounds which for a school bag like this
I think is amazing they don't actually
have it on the website anymore so I
can't link it down below but they
definitely have it in shops and if I can
find it online I will link it down below
so yes that is my bag and now let's get
on to what is inside it so first of all
I have my folders so as I said about
school these are just some plain folders
so I got from Paper Chase really good
quality a lot better quality than the
ones I had last year I just got a big
one and a small one just for different
things really because I think you always
need folders at school you always find
something to put in
and I have a person that will always
keep my things very very organized
because I cannot stand unorganized
things so yeah it's basically best thing
in the back
I then actually have my pencil case but
I have the feeling that it's in my mom's
wardrobe because that's why keeping my
back to school stuff and it's not in my
bag
so that's slightly worrying because it
handles has all of my stationery in it
but basically I'll just explain what it
has in it now I'm slightly concerned it
is a plate like pencil case with a black
sit and it has pencils pens colored
pencils a ruler a highlighter a rubber
and some scissors I think so yeah that
would also be in here which I'm slightly
worried now okay well I then have a
little beauty set type thing it's just a
black bag from H&amp;amp;M and I have a mini
lint roller a setup powder a caption
concealer and then some Superdrug oil
blotting sheets because if you're one of
my friends like I think that's in our
last video especially poppy and Amir
Amir I can't really weird Amir I always
need their blotting sheet so I bought my
own this year because I get very very
oily I then also have a Felix o helix
Oxford mathematical set and yeah it just
has all of my little like attracted in
and everything like that I think you
always need one of these for school
especially now I'm doing GCSE maths I
know just have some period pads because
let's be honest you're either going to
need them or your friends are going to
need them so I just got up in the back I
then also seem to have a load of random
spare stationery I won't be taking this
to school but it's just in the bottom of
my bag is like a rubber some
highlighters and some pens so I guess I
will sort those out later and I also
have a deodorant this is the Garnier
invisible 48 hour non-stop deodorant I
talked about this in my back to school
haul and yeah this is just a normal Joe
doing I'm just going to be using because
I don't want to sweat so finally alright
jobs I forgot why I live in here I also
have a planner and some books but
obviously I haven't got my books on
and yet because I get given those at
school so I will have those in my bag as
well I then down the side actually I
correct myself scissors are inside
pocket of the bag so that means that's
one less thing to worry about that I've
lost already and then I have a helix
Oxford sharpener with two little holes
in and finally I have a Victoria Secret
pure daydream spray halfway down so I'm
thinking I'm going to get a new one for
school because I'm gonna need this to
last me I'm not just going to try bit oh
yeah that's really really good um yeah
sorry you need to get a bit too easy cos
way because they are so so nice so that
is everything in my school bag it is
literally empty now and so light oh my
god how I wish I could walk around with
a school bag that like every day but let
me know what date you go back to school
in the comments down below I go back to
September the 7th which is a Monday
which is so annoying because so he will
go back on Tuesdays it kills me but I
hope you enjoyed the video let me know
if you did I give it a huge thumbs up
and let's smash 4000 lights because if
we smash 4000 likes oh my god actually
we should smash 4000 lights because I
have a very exciting announcement to
make I literally was going to end the
video without showing you these but I
have my own merchandise so this is a bit
random but actually I had these on sale
at summer in the city which is a weekend
just gone and I actually found out that
they are asam's and I actually found out
that they're going to be on sale on the
summer in the city app so all you have
to download the summer the city app on
your phone or your iPad or whatever and
you will be able to buy them if you wish
so I had two t-shirts a poster every
span but the posters and wristbands
aren't available on there yet if they
are by the time this goes up I will just
correct myself in the description but at
the moment only the t-shirts are
available so I have two different
designs I have one that says smile like
you're in Disneyland because that fitted
my personality very much because I love
smiling unless I like so much that I
actually get foundation lines here and
my other one I actually just slept in so
I need to just unfold it but this one is
in the font light always use and it says
I'm not a real princess so I will link
those down below on the app so if you
want to buy one you can I think they're
12 pounds and
this shipping is 2 pounds 50 they're
really good quality and I'm so so
grateful that I was had the opportunity
to design these and make them so yeah I
just wanted to cook you throw that in
there so I hope you enjoyed the video
and I will see you soon bye first in the
cracks of the landslide</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
