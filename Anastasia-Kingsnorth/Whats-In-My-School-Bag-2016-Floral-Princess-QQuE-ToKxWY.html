going to be doing a what is in my
schoolbag 2016 so I still have the same
school bag I know that but I really
really really wanted to do an update
what's in my school bag because I love
watching these type of videos to get
ideas on how I can organize my bag
because even though I do keep my bag
really organized I love to get other
ideas on how to organize it so I thought
I would do one for you so I'm just going
to get straight into it because to be
fair I do have a lot of stuff in my bag
and it's actually what is in my bag
because it's currently the holidays and
I just actually emptied my bag out on my
bed and there's so much stuff in it and
that is why I want to show you it so I
hope you enjoy the video and let's get
started so I'm just going to start off
by showing you the bag that I have so
it's still the same one as last time if
you don't know it is from H&amp;amp;M and it is
basically this huge rack here I'm just
going to overlay clip because it's just
too big and it's basically just this
huge black I'm going to clip the tote
bag but it's just it's got loads of gold
detailing and it got a gold tip it's so
big it is like so big so big easy to pay
my light and go strange and yeah I
really really like it it's got a lot of
room in you can unbuttoned the sides
here to make it bigger it has two
handles and a long strap as well so
obviously it's really reversible and I
just love this bag I think it was 40
pounds but to me that is really worth it
as a school bag because the quality is
amazing and this bag touchwood hasn't
broke on me yet so I'm just going to get
started as to what's in my bag so third
thing I can see is a folder so I
basically like to keep clear plastic
folders in my bag and oh my gosh I just
dropped it everywhere literally just
these clear plastic folders I've got
mine for milking sins and they're just
as if ones but they have broken so I
wouldn't recommend these ones but I do
just keep all of my schoolbooks in here
so at the moment I have my maths book my
re book biology chemistry physics and I
have my history book so I just keep all
of my books in there and that is
probably why it has broken two
there because it's so so heavy but yet I
just keep all of my books in there and I
also do have some more books oh I wonder
my bag is so heavy I have my history
book another biology book so I keep all
of my schoolbooks in my bag
we also then have another little folder
and it just looks like this and I keep
this is a bit random but I basically
keep sweet wrappers and chocolate
wrappers in here as well because I take
art school and my like topic for GTC
arts is food and drink and I never know
what I'm going to need like sweet
packets or something extra to draw so I
just have this like limited edition area
packet and milky butter packet in this
little plastic folder as well as my book
which I bought for Christmas Alice's
girlboss I'm reading this at the moment
I think I'm half way through I'm on page
115 and it's really really good because
at our school we have to read for like
20 minutes in a lesson 1 lesson every
week it's good Eric time and yeah so I
read when it's Eric time then also have
my school planner I'm just going to
cover up my logo but because it's
obviously you can see my school but this
is basically just a planner and you can
like organize everything in here or your
homework even though we do have an
online homework system it's easy just to
write it down in class and then yeah and
it also has a whiteboard at the back
which is really cool and the whiteboards
and it just has a load of really helpful
stuff in so I just keep this in my bag
even though I don't actually use it that
much I then also keep the GCSE English
AQA power and conflict poetry book in my
bag because I obviously I'm taking
English but this is a really really
helpful book because we just don't we
just finished poems and I have to like
revise the poems so I've got this book
and it's really really handy so if you
do if you are doing power and conflict
purgatory I definitely recommend this
book it's so good I then also keep my
calculator in here this is just the
casio gray calculator
they're like the really scientific one
that everybody has this is the one that
was recommended so I just had this one I
did have a pink one I lost it so that
was really annoying I then have some
highlighters so
basically my friend Katie had these
amazing highlighters and I always used
to ask to borrow them and I didn't want
to annoy her anymore so I just got my
own they just like this I absolutely
love them and it's so weird to like love
highlighters but I really do like all of
my books are highlighted because that's
the only way I revise so I just have my
highlighters and I love these like so
much this is why they're in the packet
and I take very good care of them I then
have a random letter which I hope we
forgot to give to my mum and then I also
have a pencil case so this is my pencil
case it's just a clear c3 one my pencil
case gets so dirty and I don't know how
like it has all these weird lines on the
side and it just goes dirty I don't know
why because I don't put anything in it
to make it go dirty but yeah I have
Gabby's pencils from Primark because her
say to be Ranger Park is stunning a
pencil sharpeners I have a ton of
colours rulers pencils but Raptors come
to see it as scissors everything like
that and I also actually don't have a
pen in here I don't I think I have a
sharpie but I don't have a pen I keep
losing my pens at the moment at the
start of the year in my back to school I
was like you know what I've bought 20
pens I'm not going to lose any of them
I'm a really realized person what if I
gone and done lost all of them I then
just keep some beauty bits in my bag as
well so I sort have a hairball to be
fair I never really do put my hair up
and if I go to school with it up but
it's always just handy to keep a hat
yeah it's always handy to keep your hair
bubbling away just in case you need to
put your hair up I then keep like a some
beauty bits in my bag because obviously
I love beauty stuff so I always keep
them in my bag so the first thing I keep
hair brush this is a tangle teezer with
so much hair in right now this is
disgusting I need to clean that out but
the tangle teezer bit rubbed off the
handle which was a bit annoying but this
is a really good brush I love this brush
so keep that in there I also keep in
there my EOS lip-balm which is the mint
one it's also good if you want like a
minty taste you can just put this on a
generally chewing gum because it's so
nice and it just smells amazing so
obviously when you're talking to people
or they'll be able status mint
everything is good and finally the last
thing I keep in my bag is this little
pink pouch and it has a golden tip and
it's from H&amp;amp;M and I love this and I
keeping it my sort of beauty wonder hand
hand cream this is amazing I love this
hand cream because smeller is also good
that was strange
okay the little stick a bit still on it
just come out from the lid okay we will
go with that I keep this really cute
lint roller in here from H&amp;amp;M and it's
just a little pink one with like a black
refill and then it has a pink one with
white dots on and these are so cute was
only 99p and I just love it
and the thing I love about it as well is
when you peel it away it's not just
white it's like this all the way through
so I just love this so much for 99p
amazing and then this little bag was
$2.99 so that's really expensive
inexpensive I'm sorry I cut it off so
that is basically what's in my school
bag I know it it makes raashi there's a
load of random stuff in there but I try
to give it as organized as possible
inside my bag I line everything cut
perfectly and yeah so I hope you enjoyed

if we can slash 6000 like so going down
there and press the thumbs up button I
love you all so much and I will see you
