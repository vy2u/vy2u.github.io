back with my wife's in my schoolbag for
2016 this video is ridiculously
requested like when I ask guys or videos
you want to see over summer
Odom's like what's in my school bag
whats in my school bag so that's what
I'm going to be doing today but before I
get in it to actually wise in my school
bag I want to talk to you a bit about my
deeper if you don't know what deep abyss
is basically an app where you can buy a
set a load of things from areas of
fashion beauty accessories stationery
everything like that I literally love it
it's free to download and you could just
make an account and sell things on there
and then you just send them off pretty
simple really it's a really good app
because sometimes say if you're on like
new look I don't know and there's a top
out of stock if you search on Dee pop
somebody won't be selling it that
actually happened to me I saw something
cons are that I really wanted and then
they had it out of stock and every
single Zara I went to and online went on
to do pop they had it this is what we
like three or four months are going out
but it's so handy if you really want
something and then you never know
somebody might be selling it I decided
I'm going to put a ton of stuff on deep
pot for you guys as I recently had a
career out of my room at the beginning
of summer and I came across quite a few
beauties fashion things that I no longer
wanted and I thought they would be
better in a different home so I have
things from brands such as soap &amp;amp; Glory
benefit and NYX for beauty wise none of
the products have been opened or used
literally some of them are set in their
plastic packaging I'm just either been
gifted them or given them or bought them
and I just haven't used them so I just
think they'll be better off with
somebody else I also have a ton of
clothes so I have clothes from misguided
pretty little thing new look well so at
Topshop I have a lot of stuff a new look
actually one I mean a lot I mean a lot
like a lot of tops and jumpers and like
longline Blazers and all of the things
like that I'm going to overlay some
clips of things I do actually have but
I'm reselling them all for really
affordable prices that they're not going
to be expensive at all and then when all
of the items have sold that are
currently on there I'll post them all
off at the same time and then all of the
money is going to go into charity I
don't want to keep your money I want to
give it to charity as it
I don't want your money I don't like
like taking viewers money so I'm going
to give it all to charity so it goes to
a really good cause but yeah I'm always
going to be adding stuff to my depop
over the course of the next few months
so definitely follow me on there the
first line in the description box down
below will have the link to my Deepak
download the app and follow me and then
you can keep up to date with what I'm
selling but yeah I really love Deepak I
would definitely recommend you get it
you can find a ton of stuff on there and
it's just a really really good app so
yeah I'm really excited to see if you're
going buy anything
comment down below if you're gonna buy
something from the things you have seen
me overlay but yeah there will also be
some other things on my new cup as well
so go download that but yeah so now I'm
going to do the what is in my schoolbag
portion of this video so I'm really
excited for my schoolbag this year
because amber actually had it for year
ten because it going into year eleven
now and she had it in black and I really
really wanted it because I can newer
version of my bag like that the bag or
the beginning of the year was a newer
nicer version so I wanted to get it for
this year and I got it in a different
color so amber had it in black but I got
it in this new deep inky shade and it's
just like a nudie pinky Brown it's
really really nice and neutral and
because I normally get black bags I
waited a bit of a different one for year
eleven so just have this like really
nice gold detailing it has like black
lining it has two handles and a long
strap which you can take on and off
which is really handy then it just has a
huge compartment in the middle and two
zip compartment on the side there's a
lot of storage in this bag which is what
I love the most because obviously you
need a lot of storage for year eleven so
many of you guys have wanted to know
what I'm taking from IGCC so I'm just
going to quickly tell you I'm taking
history textiles fine art and triple
science those are my four options
because so many people asking if so many
people think I've done my GCSEs
I haven't I'm going into you 11 I'm only
15 so yeah that's my school bag I call
it from H&amp;amp;M and it was 30 pounds but I
use uni days for discount so I got it
for 22 I think which is really good to
be fair because these bags last a long
time and my other one lasted me all year
so I'm just going to get straight into
it I'm going to dive inside the main
pocket first so the first thing I can
see is my calculator I'm pretty sure
loan if you guys will have this
calculator because it's the
how can I do that we get told to have
it's like the Casio one it's just how
can it really it does your mouths but
yeah I like this it's a nice calculator
I just put that in the left-hand pocket
and then I just have my highlighters
these are my favorite highlighters can
you have favorite highlighters I don't
know I really like these ones though
they're just like a really thin nib see
yeah I just keep those in that pocket
and I forgot to say it's all like lined
in black silky kind of material I
suppose which is really nice actually
they forget to what you can just wipe
out then the first two things I have
just like a slump down into the bag are
two folders so I have one side which is
a five and then one a four one and I
think I'm just going to put papers in
the a4 one and then in that a5 one I'm
going to put my book and my planner
because you get given a planner at the
beginning of every year even though I
don't tend to use it as much I'm going
to put that in here and then I'm also
going to keep my breeding book and I
just realize I always meant to put it in
this bag but it's in my old school bag
on top of my wardrobe but I am actually
reading go boss and I think it's by
Sophia somebody I'm not sure she's the
owner of nasty cow but I really really
like that book it's really inspiring and
like I'm know it's just such a good book
so yeah I'm just going to keep that in
there and then produce that like
homework and stuff in there if you want
to see like where I got everything from
and all my stationery stir last week I
did about school supplies haul I'll link
it on screen now and then I'll link it
in the description box as well I then
have two notebooks which I've got and I
said I spoke about these in my last
week's haul so I'm not gonna speak about
them much I just got this black one that
says notes and then just this pink one
that has like a golden light bulb on and
it just says brilliant so I just have
these two notebooks I really like these
notebooks these are the kind of
notebooks I see everybody else have and
I'm like where did you get that and then
found that where you can get them also
you can buy things like this on depop as
well which is really good I don't know
I'm going to actually go on depop after
this and look for some more I didn't get
these logs from depop but you can get
things like this on deep pot which I
really like then I have a really cool
water bottle which is your Urban
Outfitters and I love this it is quickly
says namaste bitches on it and I really
really like it it's kind of sassy and
fun and it's just clear and the juice
has that right in there it's a really
good quality water bottle actually it
keeps your water cold as well you don't
know if that's
weird or not but yeah I really really
like it so I got that from Urban
Outfitters I then also have a bunch of
things down here what I say a bunch I
have two so I have my little beauty bag
which I always end up taking out like
halfway through the year because it gets
too heavy even though it's as light as a
feather
so a cherry just has this goal to it and
it's like a pink and I just keep a bunch
of things in here I have lint roller
refills I have my actual intro which is
from H&amp;amp;M as well as you can sell like
H&amp;amp;M
I have Baby Lips and I have like nail
files and stuff I always feel like
somebody needs some of these things and
I'm also missing like oil blotting
sheets mascara out of here things like
that but I'll put those in a few days
before I think this was about two pounds
and then I have my pencil case and I
spoke about everything in here in last
week's video so I'm not going to go
through it again but everything was like
how are you going to get that your
pencil case I did it
see yeah I've got everything in here
which I'm quite chuffed about so go
watch last week's haul then you can
probably buy it all and it will all fit
in here which is great then finally in
the two pockets down the side I have
these dividers and you're going to have
to see laughing to do if you want to see
what they look like because I'm little
bit stuck in here now I can't actually
get them out left I try and like bend it
which I don't exactly want to do but
they're so so pretty like I forget out
okay I've got one they look like this
and I just say like different words on
and stuff and I have pink ones black
ones and marble ones and I just put
these down the side I'm going to
separate all of my schoolbooks with them
a little be kind of handy to do that and
then I know where everything is and
considering there's two side pockets I
can have like all of my chosen subjects
in one and then call subjects from the
other so I really can't get this back in
yeah that is basically everything I have
in my school bag I don't keep honor to
stuff in there I just want to keep it
quite simplistic and quite yet simple
really
I don't want to lug around a load of
stuff I don't really need but I would
also have in here like a PE kit some
days my lunchbox everyday books which
will weigh it down a lot but overall
that is what's in my school bag so I
really hope you enjoyed this video if
you did give it a huge thumbs up and
make sure to go check out my depop first
line in the description we'll have the
link don't follow me and go download it
and you can see what I'm selling on
there but yeah I love you all so much
and I'll see you in next
