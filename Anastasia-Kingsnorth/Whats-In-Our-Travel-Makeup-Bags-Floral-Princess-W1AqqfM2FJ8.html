going to be doing a what is in our
travel makeup bags so I'm here with Lily
from floral beauty
Hey and you also filmed a few videos
over on her channel so make sure you go
and check them out if they're not
already up they will be up in the next
few days so I'm gonna link her channel
down below so you can go and subscribe
so the makeup bag I actually have is
this cat kittens pink floral pouch I
think this is a perfect size for my
makeup the bag I have is these Avella
just say yes makeup bag or beauty bag
it's from there's a Bella range and it's
a really good size it's really good
quality I was that a pal it's it's so
much yeah it doesn't fit a liner so full
primer we both decided to go with the
benefit Porefessional because it's a
really good travel size yeah we're good
as well and I don't think this actually
costs too much no it doesn't it's only
about 5 pounds but you can honestly get
these for free yeah if you just ask your
Esther's at the counter sometimes they
give you these I'll give you them for
free so they're really good for travel
size and to be honest this lasts me like
a month just this size so readed so is
the kind of face product I have is the
NARS radiant tinted moisturizer for me
when I go on holiday I tend to go on the
plane a lot so I like to have a tinted
moisturizer because it's less coverage
then your thick foundation because I
haven't been on a plane in a while and I
tend to go by car I love my holidays I
like to take a bit of a thicker
foundation and this is the L'Oreal the
true match foundation and I can favorite
it honestly it's so good as we have 17
so you're protected from the Sun it's a
really good coverage it definitely says
such full coverage and it feels so light
on your skin and it is about 10 11
pounds to buy but it's really travel
friendly even though it is in the glass
bottle I still don't mind taking there
so for concealer because I have a light
coverage face
BB cream foundation all over my face I
like to have a high coverage concealer
so I just have the NARS radiant creamy
concealer this is my go-to concealer eye
this is my holy grail for my concealer
as well I like to go for a really high
coverage so I bought the catch and last
imperfection it's a really good coverage
it is quite heavy the coverage is just
phenomenal and this is probably my
favorite concealer it's only like 4
pounds and travel-friendly
full powder I always like to take my
Rimmel stay matte because it doesn't go
cakey on my face at all it just gives me
a really nice even coverage and set my
makeup matte all day so for my powder I
like to have the bare minerals powder
this is quite a smooth one I think this
is a travel one which I got for free
when I just asked for a tester I think
it's a foundation to the powder
foundation yeah I think it's a powder
foundation
yeah it's a powder foundation so it will
give me a bit of extra coverage as well
because again that I have a light
coverage but we cool that was just
allowing your face the light coverage
face so this is the bare minerals powder
foundation full blusher I love to take
my Mac blush because you get so much
product in it it's a really good travel
site it comes up quite dark like in the
pan but it's so light and has like
glittery undertones on your cheeks when
you put it on it's just gorgeous and I
take this every time I go traveling so
for my blush I have a little duo this is
a flush and it's lip tint so a blush and
lip tint a cheek and lip tip this is the
posy tint by benefit it's a mini size so
again travel friendly and I can tell
where I got this I got this in a set
which wasn't too expensive
can you get them for free possibly but
they're not one of the ones are probably
give to you never me lots of benefits
sets but it just gives a really nice
chewy
while we look I just love this so much
so for eyeshadow I don't really like to
take a huge palette when I go traveling
so I just took my negative basics this
is just the first naked Raider community
has a second one and it just comes with
a range of different matte shades which
are also beautiful the patterns are very
similar but I just love that like that
that's a lot darker yeah there's there's
some similarities and some differences
but I love both the palette if I don't
feel like wearing a brown or a light
eyeshadow I just want to go for that
update we will take the collection
though Maybelline at 24-hour color
tattoos so these are in pink gold and
it's just a gorgeous
pinky gold color that Joe are they junk
quick gel cream eyeshadows oats they're
so easy to use and unlike some gel cream
eyeshadows they don't get everywhere so
other diet stupid easy twos for mascara
my go to travel in mascara has to be
benefits roller lash I got this free in
for Elle magazine and it's just a
perfect perfect minute I just love it
you get a lot inside as well dude this
is asking me so long because when I
first got it before I got the full size
I've used it every day but now I'm just
going to be using this one for when I go
traveling so now we're moving on to lips
to the first lipstick I have is the
L'Oreal Paris color riche by Julie Ann
and this is just a gorgeous peachy toned
nude and I love this lipstick so much it
was the first color which one I got and
it's so pigmented and just glides on
your lips really nicely so the first lip
product I take with me is this matte
lipstick in flamingo
I literally spoke about this in like
every single one of my recent videos
it's a really nice
Coralie just a coral color coral it's
quite vibrant but it doesn't come out
that color on your lips it's quite sheer
I just love this so much so my final
nipper notes that I will take with me on
my travels is the matte lipstick in
velvet headache I absolutely love this
lipstick have you know oh it's stunning
it's like a newly brown color Lewis
actually got me this one and I love it
so shout out yeah for Lewis knowing you
Lewis go and check out his channel like
honestly it's amazing I've only used it
once but this is going to be my
traveling lipstick because and then the
final lip product I have is the NYX
butter gloss and this is in peaches and
cream this on top of the Mac flamingo is
the best lip combo I've ever tried so
that just comes around with me
everywhere so that was the end of my
what in our travel makeup bag video make
sure to go and check out Lily's video
