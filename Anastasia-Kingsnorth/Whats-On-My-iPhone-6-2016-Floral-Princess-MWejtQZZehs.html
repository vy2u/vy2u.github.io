going to be doing a what is on my iPhone
2016 so I have the iPhone 6 and I got
this last year around August time and I
did do it what's on my iPhone back then
but I really wanted to do another one
because I know how much you guys love
them I personally love watching these
type of videos and I've got some new
stuff that I wanted to show you so I'm
going to be showing you some new apps a
game that I've been loving my new
background my case everything like that
because I really is as I said I've
really loved watching these videos and I
thought you guys might find it
interesting so I hope you enjoyed the
video and I'm just going to get straight
into it so I'm going to start off about
talking about my case as you can see it
matches my marbled background my case is
basically marbled
I got it personalized from lolly lab
it's basically an app and it's where you
can personalize like phone cases
pictures and everything like that and I
personalized it I think it cost me about
10 pounds but I really really like it it
is exactly what I wanted it was cheaper
than I could find anywhere else and I
really do love it so I have that on my
phone and I think I forgot to mention I
have the iPhone 6 in silver I really
want the rose gold success but at the
moment I have these six in silver so
then we press on to my lock screen and
as you can see it says let's do
something wonderful and it's kind of
this pink ombre gold writing is very
very me and I love this type of thing so
then I'm just going to use the finger
prints to do my password because I've
already made that mistake of showing my
password in a video before so I don't
want to do that again then first of all
going to talk about these things on the
bottom row which appear on every single
page of your iPhone so the first one is
this app called Best Fiend
and I absolutely love this app so as you
can see it's basically a world and you
just have so many games to play and it's
bugs versus slugs so you have to
basically defeat the slow that whilst
playing in the games so as you can see
I've got up to level 35 and I'm stuck at
this level currently but there is over
350 levels and they add three levels
every week so I'm only a tenth of the
way but I'm getting there and it is so
so addictive and so fun
but obviously if you get a bit bored of
playing the normal games there's also
some like other minigames within that
and they're called fiend quests and
there's Howie's whispers JoJo's and
Edwards quest I have unlocked Edwards
and Howie's quest and I am think yet on
Game four of Howie's quest it is so so
fun
so then down here you have kind of I'm
going to call it your zoo where you keep
your characters that you have collected
so I've collected eight characters you
start off with one and then you have to
like um unlock them so I'm going to play
on level 35 so you basically you can
pick your team so I have to keep these
two members but I don't have any others
to choose from but I think I'm going to
go with gene Howie and Jojo and then it
takes three energy your energy you get
one more energy every ten minutes and at
the moment my maximum is 21 so I have 29
moves to defeat the slug eight times and
to open two boxes so as I said I'm
actually stuck on this level but the a
of the game is to basically connect all
of the matching like pairs so the
strawberries leaves teardrops mushrooms
flowers all of this type of things so
basically just match the same color
together and obviously this level is
actually really really hard at the
moment
I mean I'm stuck I've got do two every
level absolutely fine but you have to
move all the slow and there's loads of
these little barriers in the way so it
does get really hard but it is so so fun
and addicting that absolutely just love
this game and I could play it for so
long I do play it for so long but as you
can see I've nearly defeated this slug
and then yet now it's gone down to six
soaks I need to defeat so it's a really
really good game I'm just going to press
give up but it is such a good game and I
really really do like it I would
definitely recommend this I will leave
the download link in the description box
down below because I reckon you guys are
going to love this we then move on to
the bottom of my phone so I have foam
which is obviously that's pretty you
know
self-explanatory I have Safari and my
mail which I'm not going to show you
those because they're private I then
have my messages contacts camera photos
and videos as you can see a lot of
people know this my camera roll is very
very neat and
even though it doesn't all match I like
to keep it as matching as possible I
only keep pictures that I actually
really do like like I don't have many I
have like a hundred photos but that's
not many to me some people a lot of my
friends are like mm I literally just
cannot have mm I'm very happy with the
amount of photos I have and then have
videos but I don't really use it because
I don't really have any videos on my
phone I then have this folder called
productivity where I have my weather
calendar newsstand clock stocks maps
compass tips voice memos podcast and
Apple watch I only really use clock for
my alarms like I have a video Sunday
alarm I have my school alarms and then
just some random alarms and then I also
use the weather app a lot because I like
the weather app I then have this folder
here called lifestyle and in here I have
pretty self-explanatory things I have
the App Store iTunes Store Game Center
iBooks passbook and health I then have
my youtube studio here which is
basically a YouTube dashboard it is so
so amazing I love it so much you can
edit your monetization you can't edit
your thumbnails on here but you can see
everything else and you can see the
amount of likes dislikes comments views
everything like that and then I also
have this app called Lala lab which is
the one I was talking about earlier
where I got my phone case from this is
an amazing app you can get polaroid
pictures and if you go on prints you can
choose vintage you can get a magnet
posters framed canvases cases which is
what I got and postcards that's a really
good app I would definitely recommend
that one and then you also have puffin
here which is basically an exact copy of
the YouTube creator studio and I can
just edit my thumbnails on that as well
if I don't want to go onto my laptop if
I don't have my laptop with me and then
I have my folder utilities where I have
notes calculator reminded and music I
only really use my notes for like video
plans I write down my achievement data
every time I hit a milestone and then I
have a little message I wrote to myself
at the beginning of 2016 and then this
is I have music I never use that music
app I use a different music app and then
I just have settings so then we scroll
over to my second one where you can
actually see my lock screen a little bit
better it is basically some peonies and
so many people ask me
I got my lock screen from I found it on
Google I'll see if I can find it again
and I edited it to be a bit lighter so I
will edit one if I can find it and I
will link it down below because I know
how many if you guys wanted that so then
I have my folder called social media so
I first all have my Instagram
I'm officially obsessed with Instagram
as you can see I've actually changed my
theme since last time it is much more me
I feel like I really wanted a personal
theme like that was my old theme it's
really really bright but now I love this
theme I find it a lot easier to post I
can post more often and so many of you
guys leave me the most amazing comments
like I absolutely love reading through
all of your comments they they just mean
the world to me and I love replying to
comments as well I'll post a and oh I'm

people ask me about my snapchat and my
snapchat is Anastasia extra a on the end

me because so many people ask me about
my snapchat and yeah that's basically it
I add a lot to my story like I love
adding stuff to my story so you should
definitely go add me on snapchat I then
have FaceTime which is private so I'm
not going to talk about that but then I
also do have Twitter I absolutely love
Twitter I really didn't like it at first
like I never went on it but now I'm on
it all the time and I asked for like
polls on what videos you want to see I
tweak you guys a lot I always retweet
your edits and every time a video goes
up on a Sunday we all go crazy and we
tweet each other and you guys make me
the most amazing edit and I just love
you all so much
I just cannot thank you enough so many
like screenshotted my snapchat story and
tweeted it so more of you guys could see
it and yeah I just absolutely love
Twitter so definitely go follow me on
there I will leave the link in the
description box down below and then also
have YouTube which to be fair I'm pretty
sure everybody knows what this is it's
quite self-explanatory because you are
watching me on it now I have quite a lot
of favorite youtubers actually I will
probably do a video about my favorite
youtubers soon or sometime in the future
because I do have quite a lot that I
don't really talk about so
I do have that and then I have the app
music called dot ly and I don't actually
use this like I have some followers on
it and I'm gonna make some I made some
on private oops and then I deleted them
but my name is just Anastasia King stuff
on there if you want to go follow me you
definitely should I have 343 fans at the
moment but I don't have any music Lee's
gonna follow me on there and I promise I
would definitely make some okay then
finally we go into this folder which is
where editing folder so I first of all
have the app whitea gram or witta gram
and this is a quite self-explanatory app
if I do edit my photos I will use this
app I'm just going to go to camera pick
a versus picture I will go on to I used
to edit with the brightness but now I'd
go on to Avery and I could I don't know
there's loads of things you could do in
here whiten it which is what I do to my
thumbnails just to make them a bit more
brighter and yeah you can just do loads
of things on that app so I definitely
recommend that one I then have my media
which is where I listen to all of my
music on this is the best app ever I
would definitely recommend this I don't
have like a large music selection I only
really listen to a certain amount of
music over and over again but that's
what I listen to it on I then have
phonto which is where I make my
thumbnails and when I am like do I
thumbnails this is where I will get my
font from and I just downloaded like
different fonts into it and then finally
I have pic collage which if I'm making a
thumbnail with a collage this is what I
will use who's gone freestyle photos and
you can add a load of stuff to it you
can add stickers which is really cool
there's like loads of stickers you can
add and yeah that's what I use to make
my thumbnails so that is potentially
what is on my iPhone I really hope you
