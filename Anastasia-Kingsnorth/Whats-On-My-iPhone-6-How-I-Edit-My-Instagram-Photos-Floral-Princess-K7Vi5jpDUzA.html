going to be doing a what is on my iPhone
6 so basically last week I got to
upgrade to my iPhone 6 early because I
had an iPhone 4s for nearly two years
but my dad let me upgrade early so thank
you Dad for getting me this fine so I
thought that I would do an iPhone 6 and
this is also a collab with Lily because
she recently got her iPhone 6 I will
link her channel down below so you can
go and watch heads as well but yeah so
today's video I'm going to be showing
you what is on my iPhone and how I edit
my Instagram pictures because I always
get so many requests to do this video
and yeah I thought that it would be fun
to film so I'm gonna put my phone on the
screen just so you can see exactly
what's on my phone and I really hope you
enjoy the video okay so my iPhone is at
the iPhone 6 in silver and I decided to
get the silver the case I feel a lot of
people have the gold and a lot of you
will have the space great I know a lot
of people have the silver but I just
preferred the silver over the other
colors because I know I feel it would
look better with some cases on and
everything but at the moment I just had
a clear plastic case because to be
honest I couldn't find one that I really
really liked in time for when my phone
came so I just ordered a silicon one for
the moment and then when I go into like
some shops or I'm Topshop or something
I'll probably find one that I actually
really like okay so I'm gonna start off
on my home screen and if I just look my
phone I actually love the iPhone 6
because you can unlock it with your
thumb oh my god it's just incredible I
love it so much considering my iPhone 4s
was like a brick now and yet oh my god
it feels amazing so on my first page I
just have the usual apps so I have
messages contacts camera photos and
videos so all of you probably know by
now
actually not all of you because so you
will be new to my channel but basically
I am very I don't know what it's called
I am a touch rooty day where I have to
have everything in place on my phone and
that's why my phone is so organized
because it just kills me if it's not so
yeah that's why everything is organized
just thought I'd let you know now so in
my photos I even it's just a new phone I
actually don't have any photos other
than what I have six but they're like
screenshots and I'll delete those later
like oh god if you're someone like
and you would know that I literally
cannot have pictures and as they are
moving their pictures I'm so happy with
like I am everything else hoarder ER but
not a picture hoarder honestly I cannot
have many pictures in my phone I'm not
if when you go into my picture folder
because they're just screenshots but
yeah don't why I told you that I just
thought it would be interesting so then
I have my photo productivity and this is
where I have the like basic apps that
come with the phone so this phone does
come with some more because it is iOS a
so I've still got to set those up but I
have the weather calendar newsstand Maps
stocks clock compass tips voice memos
and podcasts there basically again just
apps that come with the phone and
nothing special with them I just have
them because I came at the phone I then
have lifestyle and in here I have App
Store iTunes Store Game Center iBooks
which I haven't actually looked at yet
passbook and health basically I'm
actually really excited for this app it
has been doing my steps today and my
walking distance and my flights climbed
this is so cool I just go on this and
yeah it's just really really cool I
haven't really set it up yeah I've just
kind of oh it's got my mom's iPhone I've
just kind of got my date of birth and my
name it at the moment but when I set it
up I probably do like a fitness routine
or something because it's actually a
really cool app I then have utilities
and I have notes reminders and
calculator I love putting things in my
notes at the moment I have in my summer
bucket list which I'm going to do a
video on so I'm not going to show you it
and then I also just have my school
shopping list because the day this is
going up with your Saturday I'm going to
Milton Keynes to go and get all of my
school stuff just to get it done early
even though I said I've like five weeks
of school I then have settings and then
in my extras folder I have the Apple
watt again which I haven't even looked
at
I have polar gram which I haven't set up
yet because I need to get my point over
from my old phone to this phone and then
I've puffin when if it will actually
load cuz sometimes it doesn't I can
basically see my YouTube like this is
where I can change thumbnails and
everything so it just has all of my
things my comment and I can just go down
here and look all my videos easily and
see everything I love this app it is
incredible definitely get it
I then have Netflix oh well I absolutely
love Netflix I will show you things I
recently watched so I've been watching
The Inbetweeners oh my god I know it's
so rude but it's my favorite thing ever
honestly me and I will just go on
FaceTime oh it will just do their
impressions because we just love it I
then have pretty little liars all my god
who is excited for the a review because
I'm so excited
alright it says I'm on Episode seven but
I have watched episode eight I just went
back and watch it again I think that a
is red and red curtis.melissa
but I would actually going to do like
two pretty little nice baby video
hopefully before it is revealed so if
you haven't caught up or anything don't
watch that video when I put it up
because ever might be a few spoilers in
it and then as I scroll along actually
at the bottom I have phones firing these
a male and then I have this little
button here and this is basically always
keep down here and you can click on this
okay it doesn't wanna click on and it
will have like different things that
it's just quicker to open if you're in
an app I then have my no photography
folder I haven't changed the names of
the folders yeah and this has Instagram
snapchat FaceTime Twitter YouTube and
BDM so Instagram is my favorite app ever
I'm so close to 50,000 subscribers and
they're not subscribers followers so if
you aren't following me already
definitely do I always go through and
check my comments I love posting
pictures on here I'll actually show you
how it edit my pictures in a minute oh
there's Lily's um basically yeah so and
then I have snapchat noise if you always
say to me that you can't find my
snapchat it is Anastasia with the extra
a at the end of 3x so add me I probably
won't add you back but I do open your
snapchats and I do put a lot of my story
and then have FaceTime which is private
I have Twitter which I'm actually using
a lot of at the moment I don't know how
many followers because I didn't really
use it but yeah I've been using it a lot
more now I don't tweet anything witty
but you know still Twitter so follow me
if you aren't already it's at Anastasia
k underscore xoxo I then have YouTube
which I'm pretty sure you know about if
you don't well what are you doing on
YouTube now and then how Phoebe M which
is private so I don't get my bbm pin out
but then I have a folder that's called
folder very interesting
I have pic collage font Oh whiter Graham
and my media so this is how I edit my
Instagram photos so basically all I have
to do is click on the little red thing
and going to choose existing or then
going to Instagram my folder and I will
choose a picture that I want to edit and
then I will just change the brightness
up once and then if it's bright enough I
won't change it but then I will just
maybe add a little bit more then I will
just go to save it to full resolution
and I'm ready to go pro on Instagram
that's practically how it might
Instagram photos it's very very simple
but yeah a lot of you wanted me to show
you that so I then have my media which
is why I get my music from I have the
weekend hild remix house of Yui pen
Minnesota different rap city and cool
for the summer by Demi Lovato I don't
have many songs because I kind of just
listen to the same song which is this
sadly well I then have another folder
called folder and in here I have some
games I have words word brain and
akinator I'm actually on the akinator
that's why I have it but I haven't
actually tried it on this phone yet so I
would do it but I think you have to
answer like 18 questions about me I'm
like oh is your cracker a girl you know
what I'll do that later but I'm on the
app in it if you want to go find me but
that is basically everything on my
iPhone so I really hope you enjoyed this
