going to be doing a what is on my iPhone
for a since I last did one of these
videos I haven't got a new phone but my
phone has been changed around a lot and
I found a couple of new apps and we just
wanted to kind of go into more detail
about my phone so I've recently found
out how to scream record my iPhone so
I'm going to put my iPhone here next to
me so you can actually see my proper
screen and my proper phone like as I'm
going through so let's get started and I
hope you enjoy it so we're gonna start
off with my lock screen so normally I
will have a picture of like me and amber
or I could quote or something but I
changed it to the purpose of this video
so you can see everything really clearly
so as you can see I just have this laura
ashley floral wallpaper a lot of people
actually have this on their wall in
their bedroom but I just have it as my
phone background and i unlock my phone
again I just have the same background
because I like to be able to see all of
my apps like really clearly and
everything so on the first page I just
have all of the usual apps I have
messages contacts camera photos and
videos and then along the little bottom
bar bit I have phone Safari music and
mail so then I have a folder called
navigation and in here I just have again
apps that come with the phone compass
stocks clock weather voice memos
calendar maps and newsstand then I have
my father called lifestyle and this is
the App Store I just or Game Center
passbook and then I have an app called
my o2 which is basically where I can
just keep track on the internet I'm
using or anything like that I then have
my productivity folder which I have my
notes reminders and calculator in always
use my notes to plan my videos and
everything and then I'll just have
settings and then I have my extras
folder so I first of all have Netflix
I'm pretty sure you will know what
Netflix is I am completely obsessed with
this I'm currently watching Pretty
Little Liars and I'm on season 4 like
episode 18 or 19 and I'm so obsessed
I cannot believe who like I think a is
anyway and I'm not going to say any more
because I don't want to spoil it for you
yeah - ode 19 halfway through it so I'm
really excited about that I then have
feature points which is an app where you
can get free gift card
so the link is always in the description
box down below you can just click it
sign up it is completely free it doesn't
cause any viruses viruses and then all
you have to do is type in the code or
click the link in the description start
downloading the apps it tells you to and
then you can get free points a trade for
gift cards I currently have 7,000 points
equals about seven pounds then have
followers Plus which is just where I can
track all my followers because because I
have over like because I'm over 10,000 I
cannot see how many followers I exactly
have so I have to go onto this app to
check how many I have and then I have
dubsmash which is just where you can
make that use really funny videos I then
have puffing free which is one of my
favorite apps it basically where I can
see my computer desktop but on my iPhone
because I don't actually have like a
proper working computer so this is just
where I track all my subscribers and
everything like that so I can just go to
my video manager and check all the
comments and check my subscribers and
everything like that so this is where
I'll also going to change my thumbnails
and on to the next page I have my social
folder so if first all have my Instagram
I'm pretty sure you will know what
Instagram is this is my favorite app of
all time I'm forever on this app
honestly I am obsessed with it so I
follow 70 people or don't follow many
people but I have 28,000 followers and I
just have like a florally past all seem
to Instagram and there's Lily's picture
I'm just gonna all that looks really
nice I'm gonna just like that and I just
have loads of different pictures on here
and yeah I just love Instagram I then
have bbm which is private and my face
time which is also private and then I
have snapchat antics to have 18 snapchat
is because I often don't go on it
because I have so many people on there
because it is um like public I don't
often go on it but my snapchat is
anastasiya a with an extra eight at the
end 3x so it does so different in the
description but some people day that
doesn't work so just try that name and
it should I then have to YouTube I'm
pretty sure you will know what YouTube
is because you're watching it right now
and then I have my kick which I kind of
remember name of I'm pretty sure it's
floral on the stage XO but again I
rarely ever check that so if you do want
to message me I'd say
Instagram diem I then have Twitter which
I recently got into using because Tanya
burr tweeted me so it kind of motivated
me to use it more so my name is
anastasia kay underscore xoxo and yeah I
had only it before she tweet me only had
like 1,500 followers and then she
tweeted me so I kind of cried because I
met her that day at her book signing and
I met over 100 of you as well
and yeah she tweeted me there in that
night so I was really happy and have my
internet I then have my editing folder
so inheritance have pic collage which I
used to make all of my thumbnails
I usually submit my thumbnails because
it's the only one that I find actually
fits the YouTube thumbnail size so that
is why I use this I just pick my photos
and I put them into the collage I then
have whiter Graham which I use to edit
my Instagram photos and then I have
iMovie which I used to edit my videos my
media which I used to get all of my
music from I type in the song I want or
Google copy the link and open youtube
converter I then paste the link in
download it and it saves it into my
media they have phonto which is just
where I add my text on my thumbnails and
picks up if I want to add like Bakke or
anything and then have my father folder
which is game so I first of all have
flappy bird and I'm still obsessed with
this game even though I'm gonna play it
even though it's been out for so long
only certain phones can have it out I'm
completely obsessed with it so I'm gonna
stop playing that because it just died
my high score is 68 I then have new
words it's just where I can play
Scrabble I currently play against my dad
and my stepsister I then have subway
surf which is like a knock off of Temple
Run but I much prefer it because I don't
know as much of a ferret and then I have
this new app called you can make up
which is where you can do people's
makeup trends over eyelashes their lip
color everything like that and I just
really like that app to do people's
makeup with that's the end of my what's
on my iPhone video I hope you have
enjoyed it and I hope it's been helpful
having the screen here if you do want me
to do another howl in my videos let me
know because I probably will do one and
also I'm so close to 40,000 subscribers
so thank you so much honesty that means
so much to me so I love you all so much
and I'll see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
