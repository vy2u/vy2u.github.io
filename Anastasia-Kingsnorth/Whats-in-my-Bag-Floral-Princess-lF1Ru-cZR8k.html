winter 2015 edition I haven't done an
updated one of these in what feels like
forever I think I don't want in the
autumn but that was last year if it was
really we're saying last year but yeah I
heard dominant 2015 yet so I thought I
would do one this is also a
collaboration video with the amazing
flora scene also known as Caitlin Rose
her videos are phenomenal she's been my
inspiration from day one I love her
videos so so much since I see just
uploaded I'm just like watch it now like
her videos are just amazing I'm pretty
sure you already know who she is but
seriously go and check her video out all
the links are gonna be in the
description please go and watch it it's
gonna be phenomenal and yeah let's just
get into the video I've actually
recently got a me bag so this is from
dresslink so I actually got sent this in
a recent package so we'll be appearing
in a very like haul soon very hot no a
very soon collective haul I don't know
my words mixed up but this is from
dresslink and it just has it velvet on
this side and then it's like pleather on
this side and it's just got like
pleather handles then it's got a long
strap and gold and detailing and then it
has a zip here I've really liked this
bag it's so much different to what I've
had before and I just feel more mature
with it I don't know I really like it so
when you open it there's just quite a
few pockets and as you can see I keep
quite a lot in my bag so let's get into
what I keep in it first thing I keep in
my bag is my essential and that is my
phone I don't know what I would do
without my phone I live on my phone it's
my life I will have all the my social
medias linked in the description box
down below I'm very active on Instagram
as you will know if you follow me that
is my favorite app in the world so it
makes me go follow me on there I then
have my purse but I'm not actually gonna
show it I'll show it in the corner
because my lighting goes like green I
just cannot stand it but it's from
Primark and as you can see just has rose
gold detailing but I just keep all of my
cards in here my cost of card superdrug
card basically store cards I love the
super dope cards they like
wait look at this no want to blind you
but has a mirror so yeah I've got that
purse and that was four pounds from
Primark and it's a really nice purse I
then also like to keep a victoria secret
spray in my bag because they sell
amazing so this one is a cute smart
you're gonna spray some oh my god it's
amazing and this is a blue one it's rain
kiss freesia and Daisy so it's amazing
and these like 13 pound trim I then like
to keep some sort of notebook and pen in
my bag so these are from Cascades didn't
what I bought for Christmas and this is
just the pen it just has flowers on it
and it says Kath Kissin on the silver
bit here then this is the notebook it
just looks like this it completely
matches the pen and I actually just kind
of keep a diary of my life in here I
don't know I just like write down
different bits that I want to remember
and actually printed some polar gram
pictures if you want to get two pounds
off of your next like program order with
your first program order I'm gonna link
it down below I'll put the code and
you'll get two pounds off so and they're
only 29 pH seriously go and check them
out because they're basically Polaroid
prints sent to your door without a few G
film highly recommend them I also like
to keep my breakfast journal so it makes
my teen go yellow but mine's actually
all past a leaf I'd like I made it
really like Kathy Kirsten E and then
this is my first page it's all Disney
themed and I haven't actually done loads
of it but I've done like the crack the
spying page of Jack's skeleton and yeah
if you want to like see a computer
direct miss journal video I'll
definitely do it want to completed it
but probably won't be completed for a
few years I then also keep my hairbrush
in there because you always need a
hairbrush and the good thing about these
is my friend Tanisha can do this I can't
do it get the bottom off and there's a
like holder for hair bands and hair
grips which is really good but you could
put it in there and then not get it open
so always gonna need to meet you there I
think you to some little ham bits in my
bag so I keep an EAS hand lotion in a
strawberry and pomegranate so this one's
really nice I recently showed this in a
haul and so I have it open but you
suffered it I love this keep to Bath &amp;amp;
Body Works pocket backs one in I love
s'mores and one in vanilla berry sorbet
these two are my absolute favorites at
the moment
and I carry them everywhere I go the
final two things I keep in my bag are
just some like makeup items and the
Maybelline the colossal black comb SCARA
and the revlon colorburst lacquer balm
in one one five whimsical so that was
everything in my bag I've just put the
makeup items back in there but let's
just pretend it's empty

down below so make sure you go and check
that out and yeah I hope you enjoyed
