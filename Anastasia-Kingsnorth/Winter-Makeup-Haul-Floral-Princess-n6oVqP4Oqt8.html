going to be doing a winter drugstore
haul so I have no idea what to film this
week and then I realized I've kind of
accumulated a few more Beauty bits that
I've picked up from the drugstore and
lush so I thought I would show you them
all in a hole this hole doesn't really
have much in it because obviously I'm
doing my Christmas shopping instead of
buying for myself but I've kind of
accumulated these things over the past
few months and even though there's not
as much as there probably would be some
months I thought I would still do a haul
because I can talk about the things that
I have got in more detail I also do have
one high-end thing in here but I saw why
it's called a drugstore haul because
basically everything else is from the
drugstore so I'm gonna do the high-end
thing first just to get out that way but
so I hope you enjoy the video and let's
get started so the first thing I'm going
to talk about is something from benefit
and I went into the benefit store on at
Liverpool Street when I went to London
with Amber for her birthday a few weeks
ago and we picked her up we both picked
it up the Porefessional license took the
lot now if you know me at school like my
group of friends everybody knows how
oily again it is absolutely disgusting I
will get an oil sheet out and the whole
thing or like stick to my face because
there's so much oil on it and you can
actually rip it off and you can hear the
oil coming off my face and I don't know
why that happened because all the
products I use and normally map my face
but for some reason when I'm at school
I'm just like the queen of oil because
none of my friends have as much oil as
me and I don't know why I have so much
sometimes I can actually feel like three
sheets up with oil at a time anyway that
was you TMI back to the hall the first
thing is this and I thought I would get
this to kind of help me minimize the
amount of oil on my face and it
definitely has minimized it hasn't
completely got rid of it because I think
that would be kind of impossible to get
rid of the amount I do have but this is
definitely minimized it and it's
basically just this little stick and you
twist it up like this and you just like
pop it on your face and you can put it
under makeup or over makeup and it which
is kind of like
minimize the oil now I don't know how it
because I think it going into the stick
I'm not too sure but it's a really good
product and when I was in there I was
like oh yeah are we gonna be like 25
pounds it was only 1550 and I think
that's like one of the cheapest benefit
products you can get and I much prefer
the packaging of it to this unlike some
of the other products so yeah absolutely
love this and I definitely recommend it
because I have seen a real difference in
my skin before and after the next two
things are from lush and then I'm just
going to want to all my drugstore things
so the first thing is one of their brand
new little mini products out and it's
the mermail ting marshmallow moment bath
oil now they used to do this in a bath
melt but instead now they've turned in I
don't actually know if you can buy the
other one still but they've turned it
into this cute little can one looks a
bit black a little yellow and pink
circle and it smells exactly like it did
it just it just looks like this instead
and it's our bath oil so what I did is
just well I haven't used it yet but I
did have another one I just cut it up
and I just put a little bit in my bar
and it kind of makes the bath water feel
really soft on your skin and obviously
water through a soft anyway but like you
can really tell the difference and this
was only 2 pounds because I should put a
little like two pounds range of bath
oils and but actually put the whole
thing in her bath and cinnamon are a bit
itchy so I wouldn't recommend doing that
but I don't need you to cut up a little
bit and just pop it in my bath and get
it really really nice the next thing I
got is also from lush and this is like
my favorite Christmas product ever like
if anybody ever wants to get me anything
for Christmas just get me this because I
love it and it is the yoga dog bath bomb
oh my lord
this smells in saying I absolutely love
this it is only four pounds and for a
bath on this size I think that is like
so good oh my god it just was amazing I
don't know what it smells like just
really sweet and I haven't actually used
this this year yet so I don't know if it
has me like exploding colours inside or
anything like that but it's a really
really amazing bath on from what I
remember from when I used it last year
don't use it I shouldn't even if it was
out last year but I have used it once
before but it was amazing so I have to
pick it up again love this please please
go buy this if you have it or just go
into enough shopper to smell it because
I'm standing all of my lush things on my
purse so now my purse is going to be
very lush like she smells my bad the
next thing I have is from Sorella beauty
and it is the zoella beauty wonder hand
moisturizing hand cream now I love this
because as you can see it's got some
proper packaging on and I'm a sucker for
anything copper and I just absolutely
love this it's just a really really nice
hand cream it smells divine like when
you're going under oh my gosh it smells
like a classic zoella Beauty sin and I
just love this I keep on my dressing
table just behind me there and it always
looks so so pretty and this is five
pounds fifty I think I think yeah by par
50 but it's such a good like size tube
for that and I just love it so
definitely recommend this and Zoe's hand
Zoe's hand so he's um range because it's
amazing okay now on to drugstore
products because I love the drugstore so
and this is what the whole is and I'm
already six minutes into it so the first
thing is a nail paint from barrier and
it is the genie high shine no paint in
shy or chai and it basically this
journey - gray color I love gray for the
winter time at the moment I have like
the pink on but I love grey and I
recently bought this just to paint my
nails with obviously Xbox we're going to
use it for and yes absolutely love this
it was four pounds but again grazed my
favorite color along with this like
brownie color and khaki green in the
wintertime so I love this and I can't
wait to pick my nails with this soon
because these nail polishes are the best
nail polishes ever
I then have a bunch of lipsticks from
Miriam and I am actually sent me these
which is like amazing because I always
use very own nail varnish and then they
decided to send me their brand new
lipsticks out so I forgot the name of
these I'd actually cut them what they're
called but they look like this just in
like a black you silver tube and I got
her stopped it I got six shades so I'm
going to go through a few
with you my favorite ones anyway this
one is one six eight and this is just a
gorgeous like nudie color very much like
velvet tell you from Mac but obviously
more what you call it trainee not mat
another one I love is 169 this is the
one I have them right now and you can
see how much I can use this because of
how much it's gone down but I have this
on right now and this is amazing as well
and then I also love number 170 which is
very similar but more perfectly toned
and I love this so much as well I your
what I can't speak these lipsticks are
so creamy to go on like they just glide
on your lips without like I don't know
what would that like but they just glide
on your lips and I really recommend
these I'm not sure how much they are but
they are so so so nice oh my god and
love them and then finally my last few
bits are from Maybelline because you've
got a little bit of a baleen because
they do the best ever
so first products are to brow products
now in a few videos ago it looks like
one of my eyebrows were liked and one of
them were dark I don't if it looks like
that now but it is my lighting I haven't
touched my eyebrows so I've been oh what
was going on but I decided to buy some
of the neighboring brow products because
I never really done any think to them
but I wanted to try and I always say
this but I will try so I bought the
Maybelline master shape brow pencil in
blonde and the Maybelline brow satin in
mahogany red but it's more her blondie
color and I love this brow satin this is
like my favorite thing ever it's just
got a little like chalky thing on the
end and then on this end it has a little
blending sponge and I haven't was out
yet because I don't know anything in my
eyebrows I just kind of test it out at
home but I will use it and then this one
just had a pendant or a booty on the end
I will use them issues whenever I feel
comfortable to go out with my eyebrows
filled in or on camera but these are
very really good products and I
definitely recommend them the final
thing in this haul is again something
from Maybelline and if your maybelline
color driver instant velvet lip pencil
in very much this
the pencil is my favorite thing ever if
in my previous videos you see me wearing
red lipstick this is what I've been
wearing as you can see it's very like
mucky now but this oh my god it's just
stunning it is the perfect berry color
and because it's in a pencil form it is
much more easy to put on in a way and
you think being in a pencil form it
would be kind of more drying but it's
definitely not it just glides on your
lips and it doesn't dry out your lips at
all this is more like satisfying that's
not the word but we'll go with that one
anyway doing a lipstick like it's just
amazing and it's only $4.99 as well and
obviously you just sharpen it to get
more out of it but love this so that is
the end of my whole just a bit a last
bit of drugstore that it's benefit you
know sometimes you just need to treat
yourself to a few things so I hope you
