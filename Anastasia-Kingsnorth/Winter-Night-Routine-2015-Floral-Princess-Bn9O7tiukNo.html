am going to be doing my winter night
routine Christmas edition so first of
all I just wanted to apologize for my
voice and yeah it I have a really bad
head cold at the moment and trying to be
as happy as I can for this video so I'm
really sorry about that
but the first thing I will do when I
come home is just put my quote back in
my wardrobe and set on my phone call it
a while and I probably have a bit on my
phone when I go out and let's be honest
everybody sits on their phone in their
night routine so I'm just crossing my
Instagram which is linked down below and
I've become a lot more active on that
recently and then I will also go on my
Twitter which is at Anastasia K
underscore xoxo which I'm also a lot
more active on recently and then I'll
just sit on my laptop and just catch up
on any email I need to reply to or watch
a movie or catch up on any YouTube
videos
once I've had another sitting on my
phone and laptop it is time to tidy up
the mess of my room from what I left
like before I went out and it's normally
just makeup mess on my dressing table so
I just end up packing my brushes away
and putting my makeup away back into my
Alex drawers and then when I've done
that I will put my fake fire on on my
laptop so every time I come into my room
it feels really cozy and warm and very
Christmassy and then I will also light
my candle in Christmas cookie because
let's be real this is the most
Christmassy scent ever and I love it
and then it is advocated time and I've
been opening the Tanya burr cosmetics
1:1 every two days and this day was
number 10 and I got the cosmetic mirror
which I think it's so so pretty like
this kinda is so worth the money so when
I've done my outfit kinda for the day I
will always go to my lush box and my
soap and glory box and pick out all of
the products that I want to use for a
bath I always have a bath in the
wintertime and especially on Christmas
Eve I will always use some lush bath
bombs all of the cruces ones and I will
just have a really cozy night in so
while I'm in the bath I will always
light some candles and then I will use
heal is a gentle exfoliator and cleanse
and polish to make my skin feel really
soft and cleanse and I will also use the
lash candy mountain because I love this
bubble bar and finally I will use my
super glowy smoothy star and my soap &amp;amp;
Glory clean girls body wash because so
the blue is my favorite brand for body
washes and body creams you get it from
foods and even though it is quite
expensive I absolutely love it
finally to end my Christmassy night I
will head over onto Netflix and watch on
Christmas movies there are so many
Christmas movies I love including the
Grinch elf a Christmas carol home alone
I love all of these and you can get them
onto Sky Movies and Netflix and they're
my favorite so hope you enjoyed this
video I'm sorry it wasn't the best as
you can hear I'm really ill when I was
filming this as well but I really hope
you enjoyed it anyway and I will see you
in my next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
