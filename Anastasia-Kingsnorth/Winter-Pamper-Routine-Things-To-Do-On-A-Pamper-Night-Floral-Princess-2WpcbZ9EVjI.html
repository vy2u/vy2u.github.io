to be doing a winter spa day video so
this is kind of going to be a video
where I could tell you a few things you
can do on a spa day and I always do
these for every season but they are
always kind of very similar so this time
I've came up with some new ideas
especially the winter which you can do
and I really hope you enjoy them because
I had an amazing day doing these things
and it was so so fun and really relaxing
so yeah I kind of like to make my
channel a happy place and a place where
you can come and kind of escape from
some things that you are dealing with in
the real world but this is the real
world but you know what I mean
and I think the winter spa day or when
to smile it-it's a perfect thing to do
that and that's what I'm going to do
this video so I'm just going to get
straight into it because there is quite
a few things actually that I came up
with and I have done so yeah hope you
enjoy the video and let's get started so
number one the thing that you can do is
go into a coffee shop and now in the
winter I love doing this because
obviously all the Christmas drinks are
out so there's kind of two famous ones
which are really good and that Starbucks
and Koster now I don't have a Starbucks
near me they're actually kind of
building one but I don't have one yet so
I went to Costa and I had a caramel
fudge hot chocolate this was the bomb it
was the most amazing drink ever
and the way they presented it and the
way the coffee shop was kind of like
done up or Christmassy and it's snowed
earlier on that day it was just amazing
and I felt so so good and relaxed and I
think this is the perfect way to kind of
start off a winter spa day just by going
to a walk into town to a coffee shop
getting a nice hot chocolate and the
Christmas cups let you talk about the
Christmas cups whose Christmas cups you
think abettor Starbucks or Koster let me
know the comments another thing you
could do is maybe you go out and do a
little bit of shopping so if there's
some things that you've seen that you've
really wanted for a long time and you
just don't know whether to buy it or not
go and treat yourself to it because a
spa day is the perfect time to splurge a
little bit and treat yourself to
something that you wanted for a long
time because it will make you happy that
you finally got it and make you feel
relaxed and I love doing that so on a
spa day that is something
you're gonna do if I've seen even if you
just a pound package of chocolate I
don't know that I've wanted I'm gonna go
and get myself it because it will make
me happy and make me have a really good
day the next thing you could do is have
a classic Christmas of a movie day now I
love having classic Christmas movie days
I love watching really like Christmas
Eve classic movies and I just said
classic like four times but I love doing
that it is something I absolutely it's
just my favorite thing to do in the
winter time I would just make my bed all
cozy snuggle up in my bed put my laptop
on and just go onto Netflix and watch
some movies so there are a few that I
really really like I love home alone I
think I search a Christmas I think then
there's also the Grinch which again is
another classic at Christmas I love the
grandeur I think that has to be my
favorite movie there were just so many
this elf which is amazing
there's the pouring of express there's
just so many Christmas movies and it
makes you like feel really happy and
even read for Christmas and they've
really like nice and warm to watch so
definitely do that and get a hot
chocolate because a hot chocolate
amazing the next thing you could do is
have a ton of the photo shoot now I
don't mean get dressed up in the most
amazing clothes you have and put
yourself an OG makeup on I mean the cute
little tumblr photos that you find wear
with the socks and the hot chocolate or
by the fireplace or like where they're
holding their hand round a cup just have
a mini photo shoot and see if you can
like take tumblr photos I'm actually
going to do this today because I really
love the tumblr photos they bring out
all they haven't winter and I really
want to try and recreate something for
my Instagram which I'll leave down below
so I possibly post them on there if they
turn out decent the next thing you could
do is make a gingerbread house now I
haven't done this that this yet this
year so I can't overlay proof of it but
this is definitely something you could
do because I love making gingerbread
houses and I actually want to make one
from scratch so if I do I'll probably do
like a baking video I like how to make a
gingerbread house you do want to see
that let me know I'll like leave a
comment down below and go thumbs up the
comment but I will leave that down below
but yeah I would possibly do that
because I really don't make it junior
and gingerbread metal actually some of
my favorite things to eat I just love
them do you like gin Redmond let me know
in the comments I'm asking you to leave
so much in the comments I'm so sorry but
yeah let me know I love making
gingerbread houses and you can decorate
them all cute and it would just be
moving cozy the next thing you could do
is have a hot chocolate by a fireplace
now I know a lot of houses don't have a
fireplace and I don't have a fireplace
either so what I do is I get my laptop
or my iPad whatever I'm using and put
the like two-hour-long fireplace on
YouTube and I actually find this is more
cozy than an actual fireplace because it
fits in your DIY at home make your own
fireplace and I love it and I'll just
get a hot chocolate my like little key
to making hot chocolate which I love is
I put a little bit of hot chocolate in
first mix a little bit of milk in pour
the hot chocolate add milk and water in
and then I whisk it together and add
like whipped cream and whiskey because I
love my hot chocolate to be really
really thick I just mark the first thick
hot chocolate and then I will just
smother it in marshmallows on top and
holding that by a cute little laptop
fire is I think you just thing you can
do in winter so I think you should
definitely do that because that is just
like amazing and finally the last thing
is kind of cliche but you could have a
pamper bar and I say this all the time
but there's so many like pampering
products and things that you can do to
pamper yourself during the Christmas
time especially because of lush and all
of the different products you can get so
I definitely think you should have like
a panther bar because you always kind of
need a bath because you do end up
smelling if you don't get one and
obviously you can have a company so
amazing actually there is one more idea
that I nearly forgot about and that is
baking I know I already said gingerbread
house but you could bake anything like
Christmas cookies Christmas muffins
brownies I actually made some brownies
because if you didn't know brownies and
my favorite thing ever I love them so
especially like homemade ones they've
just come out the other and they're
gooey and oh my god I could eat a
brownie right now but definitely make
some food because food your Christmas
tires like an essential and you could
definitely do that and all of these
ideas as well are really inexpensive so
that's why I love them so much and they
could make you have a
happy day so I really hope you enjoyed
this video let me know if I give back
give me a huge thumbs up because it was
that kind of a classic routine Panther
videos more kind of ideas of what you
could do over a few days really or just
ideas you could do around the Christmas
period because I'm going to be doing all
of these again and I love them so sums
up this video and let's see if we can
get it to 5,000 likes oh no 5,000 if you
were out there watching and also I will
leave a link to my previous video down
below which was a winter drum store so I
love you all so much and I will see you
in my next video bye in the cracks of
