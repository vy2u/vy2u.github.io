the future but it will be so much fun
but we don't know that we are at the
moment like if it's something that you
guys are desperate to have then all
really one there you never know yeah in
the future yeah definitely very much
console
yeah that'd be amazing I'm just like I
think I would drive Anna insane because
like I'm so messy she's so tidy so I got
on the how it quite one more real herbs
it like cooking and food and everything
that I like to tidy so it's kind of like
works out yeah I was saying this I
really did a how to give up we'll get a
thing because literally like Anna we and
I'll be tidying the messed up but I'll
be keeping her alive because she can't
cook to save her
exactly so so it would be I'm thinkin
 yeah so yeah if you guys do want
to see us on tour together don't know
and I reloaded question do you like the
other ones parent no yeah obviously no I
don't know yeah your mom is she's this
I'm a just kind hearted but I love how I

most embarrassing thing you two have

then that was me where there was in me
yeah that was more you so even in this
out yeah deny I don't know I'm ugly also
really embarrassing that I don't think
I'm sure Germany I'm sure like men

can't think I don't think time Brad we
pop in your head it's one of those I'm
still have been so many times but we've
been beerus thyself but yeah i don't
know oh oh and i actually i don't over
the same i don't know i can think of
certain we've had a few embarrassing oh
yeah oh my god I remember that I don't
know we've had a lot well I can't tell
you which TV friendship do you relate to
the most
I thought this is a really interesting
question I don't really let people on TV
yeah or like TV just like pretty liars
Gossip Girl Aiden oh I don't know I
don't know because immediately put life
into my hip and I was like what
friendship you know I'm yeah like I
don't I don't know I don't know I
thought I was a really good question
it's really bugging me because I don't
know what oh wait I don't know their
names and you know Mean Girls
what's that main girl cooler than the
boy oh my god oh my goodness Oscar were
those Oh Janice Janice now so know
Janice is the boy's best friend yeah
Janice and what's the boy called girls
on him it's not that's not really you
know I don't remember I don't I don't
know but yeah that's my area
oh my god this question is an obvious
answer who's the best singer it's not
that obvious
yes it is the eyes saffron she always
breaks out into song like we're just
like sitting on my bed and she's just
broke out into song a nice thing I'm
like what sometimes it every time she's
like right I'll eat you like odd cuz I
just always sing to myself and then let
you have Hannah and I will be like Anna

no not really bad you just hope you need
my baby then you know I am you can dance
better
I've never seen you know I've never read
my dance but I've been so I've never
seen you dance so I don't know
are you quite flexible or not no not at
all sir you are yeah I'm quite flexing
in your eye on you yeah yes I can't do I
don't know I can't bend my knees like
they won't go straight up yeah you were
saying now and it's like I need to serve
witness yeah I'm going to show you they
won't go like straight it's so weird oh
what's wrong with me but I was saying to
Ana definition that's always have the
conversation about dance and I was
hoping that and I was saying that I can
get like my feet to go all the way back
and touch my lips how I can literally
lift it all the way over to touch my
yeah that's insane
I don't know how you do that I will show
you one day and you yeah I'm gonna show
you my face okay the final question kind
of relates back to the first one and it
would you to move in together yes I
would
I don't know about adding Ana's like so
sweet she would move in with me but she
would get so annoyed admittedly I think
I would get a bit annoyed you know
because I even you've watched me like
you will let people that watch me every
day that I know exactly who I am
and like I am forgetful clumsy and it's
just my life the only thing that was
annoying me is the mess yeah I like to
keep everything tidy I know and I
thought I think but with that we said
earlier you do the cooking I do the
clean I would genuinely love to be tidy
and I try to I just don't have it in me
I know you guys just day I think if I
moved out and maybe are I don't know
yeah what if you have a onap I thought
that when I moved to my new bedroom I
thought about that I thought I'll be
like this tidy like clean I saw was
gonna spot though yeah just the same
zero one I love great stuff house cuz
I'm tightly envision yeah you should
actually got it girl not fried apple you
can't be late and I'm like I'm not
telling her to I don't have a choice
like I literally would spit on the bed
on myself a part like tiny your room use
