I'm going to be doing a very exciting
video and is YouTube made me buy it now
these videos have been floating around
on YouTube recently and I have really
wanted to do what because there are a
lot of products that YouTube have made
me buy and some of them I'm pleased with
some of them not so pleased with so I
thought I would give you my honest
honest honest opinions on them just so
you guys know what to get and not what
not to get
if that makes sense I have a bunch of
products here some high-end some
drugstore and yet I'm gonna get straight
into it because I have a lot to talk
about so I really hope you enjoy the
video and let's get started I have to
talk about I have to admit I only got
about two months ago but I am in love
with it and it is the Mac prep and prime
fix plus this is absolutely incredible I
was in st. Pancras and I was at outside
the map shop with all of my YouTube
friends and they and I was like all guys
should I go and get the mac fix+ and
they're like go and get it it's
incredible all of them swear by it for
their eyeshadow and it makes it a lot
more pigmented so I went and boy it was
17 pound 50 and when I was in Paris I've
sprayed it on my brushes and put it onto
my eyeshadow when I put it on my eyelid
it was so pigmented I actually can't
even explain this makes my makeup look
so much better and genuinely it's
absolutely incredible I literally love
it I also spray it over my whole face
once I've completely finished eye makeup
to kind of lock it into place and I use
it every day for two months on my face
and on my eyes and it's gone down that
much amazing or what
the next thing I have are a bunch of lip
colors and I'm pretty sure you guys
would have heard of this brands but
personally I only heard this brands
because of YouTube and it is colour-pop
so here I have three of the colour-pop
matte liquid lipsticks and these are
raved about so much on YouTube that I
just had to buy them I got these my
birthday and jazz has my Bianca shade
but I have with me VIPRE MIDI and trap
and I literally only have one fold with
these out of the whole products like
literally the only fault is the
packaging the scratches off really easy
so the packaging does look really cheap
but I can kind of get over that because
the product is
solutely in sane when I was away with
jazz she said to me cuz I can say to
what look how you wearing and I said
this feels like have you topped it up
today and I was like no and it had been
on my lips 17 hours and it hadn't
bunched literally these the consistency
and equality of these are incredible and
the pigmentation as well they're not
streaky after all they dry matte
straightaway and you don't need to top
them up the only downside is they they
do ship to England now but the shipping
is quite expensive but other than that
so worth it and definitely worth the
hype the next thing I have is from the
balm and you should definitely mainly
buy this and if you bomb mary-lou
manizer highlighter I'm pretty sure you
guys have heard of this because I talk
about it in all of my videos it is my
favorite highlighter ever it is so
gorgeous it has these gorgeous gold
undertones and it cost about 16 17
pounds to buy you can get it from places
like Superdrug or Amazon it is
absolutely incredible I've hit pan and
really badly as you can see so I am
gonna have to get a new one soon
but this is incredible I have no fault
with this it lasts all day I have it on
now so I'm hoping you can see it but I
literally love this so guys if you
haven't got this already go and get it
because it's incredible alright yeah it
says use if iron shadow and I actually
put it here so Jenny when they guys you
need this something else that YouTube
mainly by which I actually wasn't as
happy with it's something from Mac and
if he Mac Paint Pots out there was a
time where I was in love with these
because I was fairly new to makeup and I
didn't have much makeup to choose from
so this is new Mac Paint Pot and
children ice and everybody said that
painterly was absolutely incredible for
like an eye base and it was amazing but
they didn't have painted me so I had to
get this one and it was good at the time
but now I look back there are for me a
lot of better products that I could use
and I wanted this so bad and I saved up
15 pounds so I could get this and I'm
just not that impressed with it I mean
it's okay but it's not a hugely
pigmented for me maybe painting would be
better because it is matte and this is
very shimmery but as you can see I
haven't really used much of it which is
a shame really because it was 15 pounds
and I do really like Mac products but
yeah I'm just not a huge fan of this so
to me this isn't worth the hype next
thing I have I'm in a love
relationship with because I really loved
it but then I don't at the same time as
you tartlet in the bloom palette so I
got this I went to America and it was
one of the products I literally went to
America to get like I wanted this so
much the packaging I'm in love with I
couldn't fold the packaging at all it's
genuinely incredible and it has a huge
mirror as well sorry I was looking at
our makeup and thinking how like good
this highlight is yeah the colors are
amazing I just don't find them that
pigmented I mean these shades here are
very pigmented but that's because
they're quite dark but these shades here
you really need to build them and I just
kind of like to put my item on my eye
and it's super pigmented within that fix
plus it is a lot better you don't have
mac fix+ I find them really hard to kind
of get a lot on my brush but the quality
of them are incredible and the packaging
and everything about this palette is
amazing I just think the pigmentation of
a few shades are a little low but I
always say it's worth the hype just not
as much hype as some youtubers give it
the palette that I hype over though I
definitely think is worth the hype is
the morphe 35 t palette again i only
heard of morphe through youtube outside
definitely would never have bought
anything from them just because I hadn't
heard of them before but it looks like
this this is the 35 T and it is
absolutely incredible
my favorite shades are the shades on
this side of the palette because they're
kind of like coppers and burgandy's and
bronzes which are my favorite colors to
go for and this palette is only 19
pounds 50 and you get 35 eyeshadows it's
incredible the pigmentation is amazing
and more if you do amazing brushes as
well I think I have two of them and
they're so good but the eyeshadows oh my
god so many people wrote about this
palette and I didn't know where I could
get from and then I found out they sold
it on beautybay sincerity by to go to
pay and pick up one of these I have the
3500 on my Christmas list which has like
burn out and smoked oranges and stuff
but genuinely gives it to me worth the
hype and YouTube made me buy it
another thing that I'm pretty sure you
guys have seen all over YouTube and
that's purely for the fact of youtube
definitely made me buy them and they are
the Kylie cosmetics lip kits I have a
glass and I have a
okay and it's really annoying because
I'm not actually a big fan of the
glosses the paper tation and the
consistency is incredible I guess one of
the most pigmented lip glosses you could
ever buy but I just can't let it rot
it's because my hair gets stuck in it
and then it kind of like sticks to my
face and then while I lift it up it's
like smeared or my makeup and it's just
not good for me which is really sad
because I love the quality and
pigmentation of it so I'd love it to be
matte but it's just too glossy to like
powder down I don't know it's a really
nice lip color lip color lip color I
just can't really wear it but on the
other hand the matte liquid lipsticks I
can't even fault the packaging is
incredible it hasn't rubbed off once and
these have been in and out of makeup
bags every time I travel so the
packaging is incredible and it's really
good quality so you can like feel it but
more eventually run out which is so sad
this you think candy cane and it is the
best color ever I've put more of these
on my Christmas list so I'm just like
fingers crossing that I get them but
genuinely these are incredible and I
love love love them they're so mad
they're so not drying and they're just
incredible so guys if you haven't
already get one of these I know the
shipping is expensive but save up if you
have to and get one because I would say
these are 100% worth the hype the last
thing that YouTube made me buy is
something that I really wasn't going to
buy and it is the real beauty blender I
was satisfied with my Real Techniques
Beauty Blender copy but then jazz was
like no Anna by this I just can't go
back it's incredible it blends your
makeups so easy it's so soft and you
just wet it a little bit and it expands
so much and blend your makeup than it
looks airbrushed so even though these
are on the bit more of a priority side I
would definitely definitely recommend
them and like beauty bloggers have like
10 15 of these no joke like I only have
one I haven't got to that point yet but
I probably will buy some more so that is
the end of my video I really really
really hope you enjoyed it and let me
know if you did by giving it a huge
thumbs up okay a my top is on my thing
thumbs up but yeah let's see if we can
smash 7,000 likes for a huge Christmas
giveaway but yeah I love it all so much
and I will see you in next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
