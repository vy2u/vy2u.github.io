eating all the trail mix that I
purchased before my boss could have any
he said I wasn't being a team player
every time we hire woman the first thing
I'm asked is is she hot
I work in HR to perfect my co-workers
use the unisex bathroom to have sex
my supervisor has the world's biggest
Napoleon complex I'm over six feet tall
my supervisor asked me what I was doing
in the toilet I answered I was doing
what people always do in the toilet she
kept asking me exactly what I did today
at work I was reprimanded for speaking
in Spanish I'm the company translator
they asked if I was good with technology
and then they gave me a bunch of
computer cables to untangle and sort our
bosses asked me to stop printing
documents that are two-sided because she
just doesn't understand how that works
if in a dead deer and are pregnant for
four
guess who got the task throwing it in
the compactor my boss just spent an
entire shift walking around singing what
does the Fox say did a debt that death
dad</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
