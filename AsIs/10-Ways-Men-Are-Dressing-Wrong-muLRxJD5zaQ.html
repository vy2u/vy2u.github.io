underwear faced with a million different
options in zero sense of direction
sometimes the best way to know what to
wear is learning from how you're
dressing wrong little details can make
the biggest statement don't just push up
your sleeves or roll them up like a
politician try the master sleeve roll
fold over the sleeve inside out up your
arm
fold the bottom of the inside-out sleeve
over the cuff finally leave the ends of
the cuff exposed it's quick its sharp
and it'll attract all the ladies maybe
some boys too most men wear jeans that
are too large or too tight if you can
fit two fingers comfortably between your
hip and the waistband you found the
right size go for classic darker washes
and a street linka your ass in its many
admirers will thank you for taking the
time to care unless you're a surfer
avoid baggy shorts that fall below the
knee on the other hand no one wants to
see your entire thigh wear shorts wisely
by choosing a length that either breaks
at the knee or no more than 2 to 3
inches above it ok your shoes on time
unless you're doing something athletic
what socks should never ever ever be
worn with any outfit it is worth the
effort to invest in socks that
complement your wardrobe don't limit
yourself to the same shoes every day
casual shoes sneakers black dress shoes
brown dress shoes and boots owning these
5 styles will complete the widest array
of outfits one of the cardinal rules
everyone knows about fashion is matching
your shoes to your belt if both are
black or brown remember them they don't
have to match exactly look at how his
shoes are slightly lighter hey wait a
minute
tilt back up in general don't tuck in
casual shirts and polos and don't untuck
dress shirts or you'll look like you're
wearing well a dress tuck formal shirts
in which are longer with a straighter
Hin untuck casual shirts when the
hemline curves upward at the hip there
are a few easy tricks you can use when
eyeing a blazer on the fly if the jacket
is too large there will be a divot under
the shoulder and the fabric Rumbles if
your range of motion is restrictive and
the seam is hiked up your shoulder it's
too small ah there we go the perfect fit
the shoulder seam ends exactly with your
shoulder and never fasten the bottom
button let's agree though the
next shopping trip will not include the
latest dying trend the deep v-neck has a
rule of thumb keep the bottom of your V
no lower than two to three inches below
your collarbone otherwise a crewneck
shirt just goes to show that classic
men's design never goes out of style
that being said the final don't is
limiting yourself experiment with new
styles don't be afraid of color embrace
different patterns and textures where
wood makes you confident fashion even
men's is a way to show the world who you
walk it's all about you doing you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
