until marriage now I'm five years into a
marriage with a man who can't give me an
orgasm
to me bad sex is worse than no sex
especially when the girl talks a big
game and then it turns out she just lays
there yeah
that's not fun I'm so self-conscious
that I'm not good in bed that I only
sleep with people when I'm drunk so I
have something to blame it on I'm
ashamed that I'm bad at sex
last time we were doing it I literally
said I'm not good at this got off of him
and went to bed right in the middle of
things my GF is terrible in bed and I
don't know how to tell her instead I
watch porn frequently while she's not
around I finally slept with the girl of
my dreams and she was terrible in bed
didn't know how to do anything this sex
was so bad I lied and said I'd run out
of condoms just so he wouldn't try again
my husband has been getting worse at sex
I don't know how to tell him he used to
be good but he's not trying to please my
mom I'm in love with my husband mentally
but he's terrible in bed I cheat to get
what I want physically my girlfriend is
really bad in bed and never wants to try
any new positions I still love her but I
don't know how long I can take this I'm
in love with my boyfriend of four years
but he's terrible in bed and only ever
lasts two minutes my boyfriend says I'm
bad at sex meanwhile he tells me to
watch porn to get myself ready what
happened to foreplay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
