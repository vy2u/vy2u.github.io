and he sees nothing wrong with it
because he thinks he's helping me I feel
like
went to the gym got laughed at and
walked right out why tease someone who
was in the gym trying to lose weight fat
shaming is so harsh and so wrong
I hate being fat shamed it just beats
you down when someone comes along
destroying what little self-esteem you
gained from trying to be healthier I get
fat shamed anytime I go for a jog during
the day so I just workout at home now
when your own parents fat shamed you how
could you even love your own body after
that I don't know how to appreciate
myself anymore I've been fat shamed so
much I don't see myself as beautiful
anymore
I'm embarrassed to go to the gym because
I was fat shamed at one I really want to
get healthy but lose motivation if I try
to workout at home
wish I could afford a personal trainer
my family fat shamed me my whole life
and now I struggle with my weight and
depression how about unconditional love
assholes can't take all the fat shaming
I'm comfortable in my body but other
people destroy that I love them people
fat shame and say you should want to get
healthier like me as if that's gonna
keep them alive forever just shut the
 up and let me eat these doughnuts
bitch as a big girl I know I have more
fat on me and I don't care about society
fat shaming I'm damn sexy in my own way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
