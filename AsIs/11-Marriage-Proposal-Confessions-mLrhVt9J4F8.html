not gonna lie when my boyfriend proposed
I thought it was a joke the first thing
we thought when my boyfriend proposed
was that the diamond was too small
I regret that thought every day my
boyfriend proposed he didn't even get
down on one knee or say anything nice to
me he just gave it to me I wish I would
have said no when my husband asked me to
marry him my first thought was no one
else will ever ask 14 years later it's
still the biggest mistake I've ever made
and I'm still married when he proposed
my first thought was no but he went all
out for me so I had to say yes when my
fiance proposed I cried because I
realized I had no friends to invite to
the wedding I have such bad social
anxiety that when he proposed I told him
he had to hold on to me to stop me
running away I feel like something is
wrong with me because I didn't cry when
my boyfriend proposed to me my boyfriend
proposed to me today I've been looking
forward to this day forever but it
wasn't nearly as romantic as I thought
he would make it I'm trying to be happy
but I'm disappointed he asked me to
marry him and I said yes the thought of
it made me break up with him I crushed
him but I didn't want to hurt him more
by lying to him I don't love him I love
my boyfriend so much but sometimes I
feel like I am not worthy of him and it
makes me doubt a good relationship it
also made me reject him twice when he
proposed
