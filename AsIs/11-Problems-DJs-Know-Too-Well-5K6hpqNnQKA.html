- Hi, what's up?
- You're a DJ, right?
- Yeah,man.
Yeah, yeah.
- Cool, cool.
You think you could DJ my cat's wedding?
He's gettin' married.
- Like, like, like
like your pet cat?
- Are you available for an event on
January 27th, 2017?
- I don't really know...
what to play.
- Pretty much any music.
- Like a couple years from now?
- No just two.
- Hey dog.
- Yeah?
- Are you a real DJ?
Or a fake one?
- Like Friskies theme song,
maybe something from Purina's fine.
- Oh alright.
- 'Cause I was playin' a Spotify
soundtrack that I made.
Real sweet mix.
- That doesn't...
That doesn't make you a DJ.
- I don't know cat-centric music.
- I'm a DJ.
Basketball.
(dance music)
- Yo, yo, yo.
Dude.
Yo.
Yo, yo.
(laughter)
- [girl] It's my birthday.
- Oh my God, this song is so beautiful.
- Yo, you got that new Shmurda?
You know what I'm talking about?
That Bobby Shmurda?
- Reminds me of my boyfriend.
My ex-boyfriend.
- I wanna dance like this, you know?
- Is it okay if I cry back here?
(sobbing)
- Can I charge my phone off
your computer real quick?
- Yo, I got that mix tape man.
Aw man, I know you wanna play it.
(mumbles)
- You know, I used to DJ too.
If I were you, I would--
move this...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Dude, dude, dude.
Dude, dude, chill, chill,chill.
- [man on left] I'm thinkin'
Meow Mix thong...
Not the Meow Mix thong song,
but if you can figure out
a way to make that work,
that would be awesome.
- I don't...
I'm not even familiar with that song.
I'm not familiar with...
- What, the thong song?
- I know the Thong Song.
- I think it's by Sisqo.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
