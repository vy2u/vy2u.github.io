knew how much I stole from there before
I got hired I would never have got the
job I work in retail and I know it's bad
but if I'm ringing up a pretty girl and
she's really nice then I'll give her my
employee discount I work in retail if
you leave the clothes that you try on
inside out on the floor of the changing
room you are a douche and we hate you
working in retail has turned me into
such a fake person I'll lie to you and
say you look good just let you buy
something when customers make me mad I
cancel their credit payments three times
before letting it go through to make
them panic and think their card is
getting declined I work in a retail
store I've been abused threatened and
injured today and I'm not even finished
yet the joys of working in retail I work
in retail every night I come home and
watch a horror movie imagining all the
rude customers has the victims it sounds
weird but it really helps I work in
retail and half the time I would like to
drag a root customer over the counter
and knock the rudeness out of them I
work in retail and when you asked me to
check for your size I just pretend to
look because I'm too lazy to check I
work in retail and whenever I know
someone is stealing I just let them I
understand things are expensive and I
don't feel like doing the paperwork
working in retail has taught me not to
prejudge people based on superficial
reasons the nicest customers are usually
less materialistic</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
