pregnant because I'm so upset with the
weight I've gained after three years my
boyfriend and I were drifting I
foolishly panicked and faked a pregnancy
scare in hopes of it bringing us closer
together
but the crazy thing is it really worked
I pretended to be pregnant on a plane
once so I could use the bathroom in
first-class I'm kind of proud of that
now I mean no harm done years ago I
pretended to be pregnant to get my
traffic ticket dropped and I still feel
guilty about it I think my pregnancy to
publicly make my ex-boyfriend look bad
for leaving me he was evil don't regret
it
many years ago I faked a pregnancy and a
miscarriage - my husband would propose
to me
we are so happy now but he doesn't know
in the past I faked being pregnant to
get attention but recently I had an
actual miscarriage I'm feeling so alone
because I haven't told anyone for fear
they won't believe me so I pretended to
be pregnant so my boyfriend at the time
would stay with me but then he ended up
cheating on me I've lied about being
pregnant so many times I know it's
bizarre but it's because I just want a
baby so badly I just lied to a guy I was
sleeping with about being pregnant and
having a miscarriage I'm not even
exactly sure why I did he now just got a
tattoo in memory of our baby I've never
felt so shitty in my life I faked a
pregnancy test on my husband would stop
using condoms because then I could
actually get pregnant
am i awful</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
