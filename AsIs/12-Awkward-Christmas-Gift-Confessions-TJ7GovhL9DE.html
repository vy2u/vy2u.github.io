Christmas gift and I'm eating them right

oops
one time my parents gave me a used
candle for Christmas with a note that
said they can't all be winners worst
gift ever I bought my assistant a six
hundred dollar Christmas gift because
she's amazing at her job my wife was not
happy one time my uncle gave me toilet
paper for Christmas sweet my boyfriend
got me a Christmas present and I waited
to open it in front of my whole family
but when I did it was a g-string and
Bravo Victoria's Secret totally epic
fail' one time for Christmas I
accidentally got a present intended for
my mom from my dad a 12 liter of blue
awesome my wife doesn't know but every
time we have sex I put a dollar in an
envelope that's all I'm spending on her
for Christmas so far she's getting a
McChicken my boyfriend decided to get
drunk and sleep at a girl's house that
ps4 I got him for Christmas is now in
the hands of a young boy battling cancer
I regret nothing I once read gifted a
president I got on my birthday he gave
it to my cousin on Christmas because I
didn't like it turns out he was the one
who gave it to me whoops went online to
buy a Christmas present for someone and
ended up buying a hundred and fifty
dollars worth of sex toys and a pair of
heels for myself my bad thanks for
sending my fiance a text about his new
phone t-mobile it wasn't a Christmas
present or anything one time I gave
someone a picture of me for a Christmas
