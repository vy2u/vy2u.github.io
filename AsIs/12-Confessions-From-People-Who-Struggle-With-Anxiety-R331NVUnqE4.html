keep fighting it but some days are hard
I hate how my anxiety makes me feel like
I'm drowning in normal day situations my
anxiety makes me think all of my friends
don't actually like me and are just
putting up with me I'm trying really
hard to stop getting this what
other people think of me but my anxiety
makes it hard when I have anxiety
attacks I don't feel like people take me
seriously they think I'm just being
overdramatic my anxiety is so severe the
mere thought of leaving the house can
get me stressed too sick and want to cry
I have anxiety and I'm kind of nervous
that if I get treatment I won't be me
anymore
my anxiety makes me feel like I'm backed
into a corner the room is on fire and I
have no access to a door I fall in love
with so many people but never take the
risk of dating them my anxiety gets in
the way of everything day by day I feel
like I'm getting better at handling my
anxiety I failed in college for the past
eight years because of my anxiety now
I'm confident on going back and finally
graduating I told my parents I have
anxiety I'm finally going to get therapy
and get my life back I'm going to be who
I want to be again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
