with me saying that I act so depressed
if only they knew what was really going
on the worst thing about having
depression is not knowing when it's
going to hit you having depression is
hell on earth I constantly feel like I'm
drowning there are days when medication
just doesn't help I have depression and
my meds not only make me not care about
anything they make me into an
emotionless robot having depression is
so frustrating because I want to be
happy but I feel like I don't deserve it
today I clean my house it may not sound
like a big accomplishment but to me it's
one step closer to overcoming my
depression and I'm proud of myself for
finding the motivation to do it having
depression is like being in an abusive
relationship with yourself both
physically and mentally the worst part
about having depression is when everyone
tells you to try and be happy I'm
constantly tired no matter how much I
sleep no matter how little I do in the
day having depression is exhausting I
have depression and I'm scared nobody
will ever want to love or respect me I
will never be ashamed of the fact that I
go to therapy and take medication for my
depression and anxiety best decision I
ever made for myself I have beaten
depression before I can beat it once
again I won't give up so easily</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
