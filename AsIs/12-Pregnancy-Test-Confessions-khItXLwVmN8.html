first time tomorrow and I'm so scared
I'm going to be disappointed if my
pregnancy test is negative I really want
a baby
my younger sister found a box of
pregnancy tests and asked what they were
my mom said they were magic wands that
made men disappear I stole money for my
mother to buy weed in the pregnancy test
oops I think I need a pregnancy test my
biggest challenge is sneaking it past my
9 year olds I went to the doctor's to
get a pregnancy test and ended up having
sex with my doctor instead 15 and
pregnant scared to buy a pregnancy test
just took my first pregnancy test and it
came out negative so relieved my dumb
ass forgot to take the cap off the
pregnancy test before peeing gotta do it
again taking their pregnancy test in the
morning I've been with the same guy for
almost two years
I kind of hope it's positive I'm 27 days
late for my period but keep getting
negative pregnancy tests I'm going crazy
just took a pregnancy test and I'm
pregnant
only problem it was a total accident as
in the father is 30 years older than me
I have no clue what to do I'm terrified</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
