seriously steamy sexual fantasies about
one of my co-workers once I'm at church
camp I pretended to act demon-possessed
so the hot youth pastor would lay his
hands on me one time at summer camp I
took all the towels from the girls
showers and they had to run out naked I
was a camp counselor over the summer I
held my campers put laxatives in another
cabins juice pitcher I slept with my
boss at summer camp and his girlfriend
walked in I farted five times while in
attention at band camp when I was at
summer camp
my counselor banned me from seeing my
boyfriend so I threw her phone in a pond
she still doesn't know what happened to
it this one time at band camp
I played my recorder solo with my boy I
asked my crush to the dance at camp we
were having fun until I broke my foot
trying to impress him with my dance
skills
I accidentally smacked my camp counselor
and ass while swinging on a pole it
looked like she enjoyed it once at
summer camp I was dared to run in front
of five counselors naked yelling I'm
free I did it and it was the best night
ever I went to church camp and ended up
skinny-dipping with a hot girl in the
river that they used to baptize people
sorry Jesus
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
