more action with girls than I do nothing
makes me more jealous than another guy
making my girlfriend laugh I get jealous
when she talks about other guys because
I have feelings for her but she doesn't
see me as anything more than a friend
very frustrating I don't like it when
other girls say some guy is hot it makes
me jealous
this distance is killing me it sucks not
being able to go out with my girlfriend
I'm jealous of the people who get to
spend time with her I get jealous when
my girlfriend goes alone to the gym all
I can think about is how many guys are
trying to get at her people flirt with
my girlfriend all the time
it makes me jealous that no one flirts
with me my roommate has his girlfriend
down and is staying with us kind of
makes me jealous I'm a jealous guy I go
to sleep early for work but I always
feel that my girlfriend stays up talking
to guys as a guy I'm really jealous
girls can have multiple orgasms I'm
jealous of my best friend's cat I wish
she looked at me the way she does that
damn cat my best friend knows exactly
what he wants to do with his life and it
makes me jealous</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
