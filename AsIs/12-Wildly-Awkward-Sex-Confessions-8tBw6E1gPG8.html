morning he stops looks me in the eyes
and says we are like porn stars for God
my boyfriend accidentally called me bro
during sex last night I just yelled my
own name during sex well this is awkward
yesterday accidentally rolled over onto
our pizza while we were having sex
my boyfriend rolled on me not once but
twice during sex I ended up ruining it
by laughing too hard I stopped my
boyfriend in the middle of sex so we
could floss together my ex once fainted
during sex I have no idea how long he
was out before I noticed what I was busy
I once had sex in a field we got
interrupted by a horse that wanted to
see what the fuss was all about I
accidentally said oh yeah bitches during
sex with my husband luckily I don't
think he noticed accidentally started
singing the Pokemon theme song during
sex
thankfully my girlfriend went with it
once was having sex in a field
I had a screaming contest with a coyote
so apparently something I said during
sex last night sounded a lot like hey
Siri call my dad
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
