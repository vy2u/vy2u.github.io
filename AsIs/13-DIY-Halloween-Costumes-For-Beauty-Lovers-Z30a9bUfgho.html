boldly babes I'm Lindsey Lindsey and I
were talking about Halloween we had so
many ideas for Halloween costumes that
we decided to split them up between the
both of us everything relating to makeup
and beauty and there's a lot of puns
these looks are scary good and scary
easy to do Lindsey's gonna take on half
the costumes we here in New York are
gonna take on the other half of costumes
and it's gonna be also training here the
idea was to have like a whole Lindsey's
in LA Ashley's in New York and obviously
I get this shitty weather he's like in
the Sun under a palm tree let's do this
shout out to all the v IV Rouge members
this Sephora bag look is for you the
only thing you're gonna need a DIY for
this look is a headband and some red
tissue paper then just top it off with a
Sephora bag and a striped black and
white dress and you are set for a night
out or really creepy shopping trip to
Sephora for the Big Mac and Fries
costume the first thing you're gonna
need is a nude colored dress then I just
free handed the Mac logo with some black
fabric paint and a skinny paintbrush we
topped it off with this cute black beret
hat and then I ordered this awesome
french fry bag from Amazon and there you
go you are a Big Mac and fries so if
you're a big Kat Von D fan like Jazz's
this one is definitely for you all
you're gonna need is some cat ears of
fierce cat eye cat makeup and big
tattoos this next one is not a pun at
all it's pretty literal you're just
going on highlight everyone's favorite
beauty product we glued an old highlight
palette to this little stewardess hat
that kinda looks like a bra Cup but
that's okay we've got this shimmery gold
dress and then BOOM
there you go you are officially the
highlight of everyone's day here's a fun
spin on lime crime for feeling little
dangerous all you're going to need is a
black tea some green ribbon some fabric
glue and you're just gonna paste that on
there look like a little robber
accessorize it with a lime beanie a
robber mask and some lined gloves and
now you are my friend Kaylie did this
one it's really funny if basically you
just make a bunch of bees out of
pom-poms
get yourself a beekeeper suit a name tag
that says Burt and there you go you are
Burt's Bees as easy as that I love this
one because it is so simple and really
cute all you're gonna have to do is hold
a white sheet in half and then cut out
and then just put on a cute map because
sheet plus mass equals two minutes
next we've got our swatch team costume
so I got this black utility vest and
some iron-on letters and I just find it
on the word swatch I will say be careful
with the heat settings on the iron
because those bests are typically pretty
thin you can burn them very easily we
edit our Kylie Jenner swatches to our
arms and I also made a matching watch
team hat to go along with it here's our
fun take on an iconic manicure design a
French tip just write some tips to give
out to people for the rest of the night
then just accessorize with a beret and a
stripe sure
this next one might take some explaining
but it's pretty funny it's urban decay
we basically made a headband that looks
like a city skyline just rip up a white
t-shirt add some fake blood on there I'm
very impressed with this look that
uniess made because her makeup still
looks good even though she looks dead
for the person who just loves taking
their makeup off this one's for you pull
the weight sheet in half cuddle at the
top then you're gonna take paint and
just smear it all over the place I used
makeup wipe is never perfect and neither
is mine so don't take this part too
seriously next we've got every beauty
addicts favorite applicator the Beauty
Blender we made the logo out of some
colored felt and then it got the perfect
colored dress also if you've got a dog
perfect you used to have a Beauty
Blender and a mini Beauty Blender how
cute is that instead of going naked for
Halloween and go as a Naked palette find
some dresses in the different shades of
The Naked palette and then accessorize
with a palette purse using just a
painter's palette some rope and gluing
I love this one because it's perfect to
go as with a group of friends
all right that is our 13 DIY Halloween
costumes for the Attic

gonna be</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
