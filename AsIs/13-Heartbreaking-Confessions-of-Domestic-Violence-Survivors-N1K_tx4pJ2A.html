one ever understands how hard it is to
leave a domestic violence relationship
unless they have been in one themselves
I don't tell people that I'm a survivor
of two domestic violence relationships
because they always look at me like I'm
still a victim I'm a victim of domestic
violence my family and friends don't
know they all think he's the perfect
husband I hate him to death the hardest
part about dating after my marriage is
telling them I am a survivor of domestic
violence no one wants to deal with that
I finally got the guts to report the
domestic violence from my ex-husband who
was the father of my children I think
it's made my anxiety worse I'm a
survivor of domestic violence
I suffer from PTSD because of the abuse
I suffered over two years I've lived
with domestic violence my entire life I
can't even imagine what it would be like
to have a regular family I'm a domestic
violence survivor dealt with it for
seven long years the memories flashbacks
and nightmares haunt me every day but I
pray I will see the light again I shared
my story of being a victim of domestic
violence with a friend he said to me how
could someone stay with an abusive
person that's so stupid I couldn't
believe how insensitive he was I'm a
survivor of domestic violence and I
still live in fear I never thought I
would be a victim of domestic violence
I've never imagined that I would have to
get the police to rescue me from someone
I love how do I learn to live or love I
survived domestic violence I'm still
alive I am safe I am strong I am a
survivor of domestic violence it's been
eight years but I now have my
self-esteem and self-worth back and I
know I'm beautiful
