during sex and I told him I squirted I
feel bad about it I lie to my boyfriend
when I tell him he has the biggest penis
I've ever seen its average but he gets
so cute and excited I lied to my ex and
said he made me feel good during sex he
never gave me an orgasm not even once
I'm always quiet during sex but lately
I've been faking my moans just so that
she'll feel she's doing better you know
killer fact or the truth I just can't do
it whenever I fall asleep during sex I
just tell my boyfriend I'm too high in
reality he's just terrible in bed and I
get bored
my ex-boyfriend asked me if I thought
about girls during sex I lied and said I
haven't I told my boyfriend that not
being able to get wet during sex was a
side effect of my medicine I lied I have
to lie and fake moan during sex with my
bf he doesn't make me feel good but I
don't want to hurt his feelings whenever
I say harder during sex
I don't normally mean it I just assume
it turns guys on told my girlfriend I
loved her drinks sex last night but it's
not how I really feel
she said at first and I didn't know what
to do my boyfriend asked if I wanted a
baby during sex in the heat of the
moment I said yes but really I don't
mean it this could turn out badly I
started crying while having sex with my
boyfriend and I told him it was because
I loved him so much really
I was thinking about how much I miss my
ex I once lied to a guy and told him he
was my first because I started my period
while we were having sex
