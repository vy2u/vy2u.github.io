two-year-old used to constantly scream
my nipples are too hard we were getting
ready to leave a birthday party and went
up to the mother of the birthday child
to thank her for inviting us my
two-year-old son slapped her butt and
said thanks for the cake babe that's how
his father thanks me for dinner and
apparently he thought it was just how
you thank people for food my
three-year-old son broke free from me in
a crowded shopping mall yelling ball
when I finally shoved through the crowds
and found him hit pride a tennis ball
off an elderly man's Walker and was
engaged in an intense tug-of-war over
the remaining one while onlookers gate I
hastily pried my son away from the
Walker apologized profusely and replaced
the tennis balls my six-year-old son was
at a hockey game when after a
particularly bad call he yelled get off
your knees Ref you're blowing the game
like father like son we are at my
mother-in-law's house for dinner when my
four year old son asked his very quiet
and reserved grandfather Grampy what
color is your butthole he then proceeded
to bend over spread his cheeks and ask
Grampy what color is mine my
two-year-old decided to tickle strangers
toes in the next bathroom stall my
three-year-old was at a checkup and he
was being such a big boy he even let the
nurse prick his finger and took it like
a champ next thing I knew she dropped
her pen and when she bent over he zoomed
in on her bud and started wrapping big
booty ho big big booty ho I have no idea
where it even came from but the nurse
and I lost it when my three-year-old had
a scrape near his penis he asked
everyone who passed us if they wanted to
see his foo-foo and started pulling down
his pants when my son was three he liked
to collect acorns in a plastic bag and
carry it around with him we were in the
store when a lady noticed the bag of
acorns and asked him what it was he
yelled out it's my nutsack my kid yelled
Mazel Tov at the end of a Catholic
Christmas fast after my son learned what
made boys and girls different he started
introducing himself to random people
bustling hi I'm John and I do not have a
vagina when my son was three I got a
call from the daycare center
another child had knocked over a bunch
of blocks my son was playing with and my
son turned to him and said Matthew
you're such a douchebag I later got
called into the office because parents
were upset their kids came home asking
what a douchebag was we were having
dinner at my husband's boss's house when
my four year old told my boss's wife
that Isaac hit him at school I said did
you make up with Isaac he said guys ik
I'm pretty sure we're never going back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
