believe fully playing together and
working on my tan while getting paid I
babysit for my neighbors all the time
after the kids are asleep I go in their
hot tub naked once while I was
babysitting the bathroom was locked and
I really had to go
so I peed in a litter box never have I
been so embarrassed the first time I
babysat I expected it to be like a porno
where the dad comes on to you and you
end up getting laid not reality I was
cooking and I heard screaming so I ran
into the room and the kid on babysitting
is watching pornhub being a babysitter
makes me want to destroy all children's
toys that can talk my favorite part of
babysitting is making the kids do
for me I feel like a bad babysitter for
not being extra strict with the kids I
think of them more as friends than I do
is my job the girl I'm babysitting keeps
humping her stuffed rabbit when the kids
I babysit are being bad I lay a legas on
the floor hoping they'll step on them I
babysit for a single father and I
fantasize about us sleeping together I
made the kid I babysit watch a horror
movie because I wanted to watch it no
regrets
babysitting makes me want kids even more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
