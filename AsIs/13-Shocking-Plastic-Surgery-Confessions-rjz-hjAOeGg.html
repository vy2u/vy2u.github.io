hoping to get my nose broken so I can
redo my rhinoplasty using my school
refund to liposuction my love handles
away and I can't wait I've been saving
up for a nose job but I gave it to my
brother to help pay for his college I've
had dermal filler a nose job jaw
implants butt implants and Botox nobody
suspects because I'm a guy
my 511 size 8 mom is getting liposuction
tomorrow no wonder I have such a body
image I got a nose job at 14 because I
was bullied and all anyone can see was
my nose not me why is there a stigma
against it I'm old enough to be judged
for my looks sure as hell I can get
rhinoplasty I'm saving up for a chin
implant instead of a car having kids
ruined my body and I want plastic
surgery to fix it but I don't want to
set a bad example for my daughters
how do I teach them to love their bodies
when I hate mine my parents provide me
to get all A's with plastic surgery and
injections I hate how women have to put
on such a front makeup plastic surgery
and all that other crap is so evil to a
self-esteem who needs Botox when there's
kissing and lip fighting my family looks
down on me because I want to get tech
implants and alter my body I just want
to feel more attractive in my clothes if
I ever get a tummy tuck I'm gonna have
to surgeon to make a little pocket below
my navel so that I'll always have a
place for my iPod</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
