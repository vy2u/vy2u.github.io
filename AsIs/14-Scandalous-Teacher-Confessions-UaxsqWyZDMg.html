I'm a stripper
because let's face it teaching itself
doesn't pay the bills I'm a teacher and
I mispronounce names all the time to
make my students upset I'm a teacher and
I had sex with another teacher in my
classroom I got drunk at 9:00 a.m.
because I was nervous before my first
day as a teacher whenever a student I
hate turns in a paper I throw it out and
blame it on them five of my students
have FS in my class as a teacher for the
past 15 years I make the kids watch a
movie when I'm hungover I'm a teacher
and I have a crush on one of my students
I'm a guy and I sex during class I'm a
teacher and when the kids go outside for
recess I watch porn as a teacher I'm not
supposed to have favorite students but I
definitely do I'm a teacher and I buy
drops from my former students and during
my breaks I smoke weed with my favorite
students I'm a teacher
and most of the stuff I teach is useless
I'm a teacher I can't stand my job I
love most of the kids but I hate their
parents
Wow
it's just so sad what's happening over
there oh yeah you don't know the half</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
