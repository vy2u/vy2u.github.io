his name while having sex with my
boyfriend we're not together anymore
we tried to have sex in the fitting room
of Sears like we always do and we got
kicked out awkward once while having sex
with my boyfriend in a field
I had a screaming contest with the
coyote my dad was helping me move out of
my apartment and all of my sex toys fell
out of my dresser drawer embarrassing
the first time I was with a girl I got
so excited that my nose started to bleed
like a freakish anime character when I
saw her naked I once thought about candy
crush during sex I had an asthma attack
while having sex with my boyfriend a
once got so aroused during sex I
lactated I'm not pregnant
it was freaky I broke my tailbone during
sex because he tried to pick me up
I freaked and flails and he dropped me I
told people I fell down the stairs when
I was in high school my teacher caught
me having sex in the school parking lot
with her husband when my boyfriend was
eating me out last night I farted in his
mouth I was giving my boyfriend a bj
when he said I think you're pretty I
couldn't resist the urge to sing Teenage
Dream Katy Perry so I did it while using
his penis as a microphone the first time
I had sex I cried how embarrassing
