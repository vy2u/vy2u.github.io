I don't know if I should tell her
I am too
when I tell people I'm asexual they
stare at me like I'm a unicorn
according to a lot of people we don't
exist I am openly asexual at school but
not at home I tried some my parents but
they say it's a phase bouncing
differently when I'm older it makes me
angry when people laugh because I'm 17
and I'm still a virgin they don't
understand that I'm asexual
I hate it when people say I can't know
I'm asexual because I never tried having
sex that's like saying you can't know
you're straight without having been with
someone of the same gender today I told
the girl that was crushing on me that
I'm asexual she hates me now
I'm scared people won't find me as
pretty if they find out I'm asexual just
because I'm not sexually attracted to
anyone and I don't want to have sex it
doesn't mean I don't want a loving
relationship I feel that being asexual
reduces my chances of finding a
relationship asexuals get no love these
days it seems there's no love if there's
no sex I am a sexual I am also a victim
of sexual assault although people try to
tell me they are I can 100% say that
those two facts are completely unrelated
the one thing that scares me the most
about the future is spending it alone
because I'm asexual I just came out as
asexual to my boyfriend he was totally
cool with it
I love him so much to all my fellow
asexuals out there you are not broken we
are not broken
I'm asexual and I'm hottest bucks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
