of supersize me I don't know how it ends
it seemed like fun he'll figure out how
to fix this by the time I'm middle-aged
I mean when the do you see an
Arby's I exercise for 45 minutes
yesterday fun I took the long way around
the mall it's chicken it's healthy it's
not like it's pork wings the pedals are
vegetable I got the salad
cool this helps with my depression it's
NFL season what am I gonna not eat
chicken wings it's roast beef it's not
fast feed
it's like deli meat cuz when you drink
alcohol you get hungover cuz sometimes
you smoke pot hi can I get ice cream on
a chicken sandwich humper
yep smoked weed at the mall
ice cream on a chicken sandwich and then
my girlfriend's probably still it's a
zing wolf I'm on a road trip what am I
gonna eat trail mix look it did not eat
fat burger in Los Angeles if you think
about it the food industrial lobby has
really forced me to eat this way by
lobbying to subsidize corn syrup and
other unhealthy products making the
cheapest food often the most unhealthy
in addition billions of dollars of
marketing funds have gone to
conditioning me to expect a short live
dopamine rush as the saturated fat
enters my bloodstream making it not only
accepted but rewarding to eat this stuff
that can only marginally be classified
as actual food it tastes real good
though
Hey pretzels are healthy right
they're pretty healthy these are like a
healthier like new put a salad in a
pretzel or something like that
but if what if I get like
what's worse the sinful cinnamon or the
dog bites what's worse for you
all right I'll get the dog beds
it was healthier is that okay making a
