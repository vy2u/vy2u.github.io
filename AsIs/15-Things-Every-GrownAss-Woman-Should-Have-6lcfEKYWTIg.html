liquid okay so you're a grown-ass woman
there's a few things you're going to
need for starters an expanding file
folder for things like takeout menus
instruction manuals car bills vet bills
and health insurance papers sure you
might not read them but you'll know
where they are get a printer that works
you are too old to go to Staples every
time you need to print a w-9 you know
what else Rena something huh things on
their walls you have a life with framing
so do it and for that you'll need a
drill and drill no not a fun one just a
good one that works see I liked that one
it's not making me deny my preference
because you're obsessed with the
shooting gender norms huh fine just
don't confuse it with this which you
should also have get a quality chef's
knife and a cutting board just make sure
you know how to handle them the uh okay
well at least you have a first aid kit
once you learn how to handle that knife
you'll want to have a dinner party good
thing you have a collection of cloth
napkins some forever stamps and cards a
plant you won't kill and if you want to
keep that fed around a list of emergency
vets also the number of a good handyman
a plumber and an electrician Hey why
they all got to be men um yeah who's
enforcing gender norms now moving right
along
reusable latex gloves a broom and a
flashlight
Oscar in case that pet goes missing
Oscar or if the power goes out and you
have to call that electrician who could
totally be a woman
non-slip belt hangs you I forgot one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
