couldn't have one I had to bail my
brother out of jail because he started a
fight with a guy that didn't like owls I
play my violin badly on purpose to annoy
my brother I will go as basic white girl
on Halloween and we'll just have to
borrow my sister's stuff I gave my
sister a special brownie and she thought
she was dying my brother makes out with
the teddy bear he's 16 my brother snores
even when he's awake my brother hates
his birthday so I make the biggest deal
out of it my parents took my brother's
coming out better than when I told them
I'm a vegetarian
my sister pissed me off so I had sex on
her bed I have social anxiety so my
sister and I learned sign language and
pretend I'm deaf and I will carry a baby
for my sister if she finds out she can't
have another one time I paid my brother
to do choice for me with money that I
stole from his room while he's doing the
chores my brother is not that great my
sister was running late for school I
walked in on her brushing her teeth and
using the toilet at the same time she
said you don't know the struggle she's
