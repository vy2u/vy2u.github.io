a really long week and my skin
definitely feels it so I'm gonna grab
Chantelle and Freddy and we're gonna go
on a lady like worth it skincare
adventure let's get some facials topic
2x we're going on an adventure
suit up the way up suit up let's get out
of here I was thinking that it's been a
long week and my face is feeling a
little discouraged and so I thought it
would be fun to do some facials oh so
we're on going on a facial adventure
we're going to do a cheap facial all the
way to an expensive facial yes we were
doing these Steven Lidz classic worth it
episode I was gonna do it in one day but
turns out it's really bad for your skin
to do more than one facial in one day
you're supposed to wait at least a week
in between so it's a three week long
adventure I got really bad acne like all
throughout high school and so I would go
and get facials like every month and it
actually helped a lot with my own thing
actually I think the first facial that I
did was when we were at John Sayles
house before yeah I did I've had a few
facial treatments done to my face before
but the problem is that a lot of facial
places are just so expensive they're
just really not that affordable and it's
just like it's hard to justify that kind
of expense so for the cheap version
we're gonna do it to each other we're
going to DIY it so I went to Target and
bought uh some fun stuff and we're gonna
give each other facials today in the
least sexual way possible so we're here
at Ron tells apartment the spa should we
all go to the bathroom together yeah my
room I can put it on you should put your
room so first we're gonna go in with the
kale detox deep cleaning face wash
now Chantelle is going in with the
removal stealing sex to the stove we're
gonna be steaming our faces so our
entire face in the water
ready coffee yeah
oh right that you money
oh it is hot yeah Wow so here's a
fresh-faced Oh
oh my god alright so this is the
horrifying geek detox mask it is I
believe on for five to twenty minutes
and the music water everything smells so
good ah which i think is a key point in
a facial you need stuff to smell good
okay so we're gonna take shawntel's mask
off just with some water hmm
I know we need any uh playing in the bag
it's just Freddie hold the candle
Freddie she's doing it okay now I'm
gonna put on this cucumber calming mask
it's a sheet mask and we're gonna leave
this on for as it says ten minutes oh
this is that tingle mm-hmm but it is
kind of good yeah it's been kind of a
more of an tingly mass than we expected
I feel great now now that it's all yeah
but I still feel a tingling yeah I don't
a tomb I feel yeah okay all right so
this is our final step this is a
oil-free moisturizer oh look at me don't
turn away I feel like when you have like
your friends who do it for you it's less
just like lonely doing it alone you are
kind of like getting treated they
realize that like we're gonna be doing
so many like when use a DIY mask
at home I got to send one sheet mass and
done you know
all night oh yeah what do we do now just
stay here actually nap we could no yeah
curl up all right facial number two
we're going to face house there an
express facial place and they call
themself the dry bar of facials the
price point at base house starts at 55
and then you can do like a little add-on
facial fat have you guys ever heard of
the vampire facial I just know Kim K did
it okay so the vampire facial
essentially what it is is that they draw
your blood and then they put your own
blood that they've drawn back in onto
your face apparently like the platelets
in your blood will help reduce the signs
of wrinkles and aging I am Katie and we
are at face house in Studio City
we provide Express facial facial start
at $55 and we have $10 add-ons as well
as 20 and $30 add-ons so we don't
compete with the higher-end spas we are
specifically targeted treatments there's
not a lot of fluff with our facials
fluff is good but here we want to get
you in and get you out and take care of
your skin so tell me a little bit about
your skin so I have very dry skin well
in that case I think we should do the
house special
it's our hydrating moisturizing red
carpet glow facial I will
do the poor me add on so they could use
an extraction you look I have a little
bit of a congested skin okay I feel like
I don't always have breakouts but I very
often have just like little black and
white heads I think we should do the
face plant which we're going to use all
organic products my mom and I'll
customize it to your skin oh great
awesome I'm into that so growing up I
had really bad acne but since being an
adult it's kind of leveled out okay so I
think we should do the house special
today and not when you don't get any
extractions and we're just gonna do a
nice hydrating facial it's gonna really
calm the skin down okay so right now I'm
gonna do an enzyme on you right now okay
what enzyme is do is they dissolve the
dead skin and then it's gonna prep your
skin for extraction this is the
pineapple enzyme pineapples actually a
natural fruit hafidh okay so I'm going
to do extractions now I'm just gonna put
these goggles over your eyes to protect
them from the light is this a good look
for me I think you look beautiful I'm
actually going to do some high-frequency
on you high-frequency is another way to
kill some bacteria it's a little bit
deeper so it is creating a zone yeah and
ozone actually kills bacteria you're
gonna feel a little zap I'm gonna lift
it call this is working
I'm gonna put the mask on now gonna feel
a little cool on your skin so the
cocktail mask is a mixture of our clear
skin probiotic from eminence and then a
strawberry rhubarb and that is great for
hydration so this is going to feel
really cold on your skin all right what
this is good because it was really good
for calming the skin and inflammation so
you're gonna fill air in a mist I'm just
relaxed keep your eyes closed oh so cold
is really good for the skin oh yeah it
is cool really nice
this is like a BB cream so it has like a
moisturizer your SPF and a small amount
of tint so it's not full coverage but
it's just like nice evening and it has
20% zinc oxide in it how do you feel
like a clean Wow
how so I feel like I look like I've just
slept for like 20 hours Wow I just feel
like heaven
I feel loo there was a lot of sensory
overload there's a lot of amazing smells
so much live endure things happening
actual avatar mmm
pineapple strawberry rhubarb I think the
cooling blooms may have been my favorite
by the Cullen bulbs are probably the
most unique part where I was like wow
this feels like something good is
happening yeah like my skin just still
feels it doesn't have that same great
sensation but just still feels fresh
ready for the next one next up well we
have to wait at least one week next week
yeah Cleopatra
okay you guys gold elements has sent us
a town car in fact I was like oh we
don't need a limo and she was like no
everyone who gets the Cleopatra facial
gets a limo the funniest part about is
that were five minutes away from the spa
and we have a town car which I'm not mad
at but I'm not gonna be me
okay well here we are yeah it's doing it
it already smells like a spot in this
car is quite luxurious it smells amazing
who knew we're gonna be treated like
Queens like a loom by clear Papa midnite
deburring I mean it is it feels kind of
naughty yeah there's the Cleopatra
facial which is the the $750 crazy-crazy
they also have which I feel like is a
running theme in like worth it episodes
a truffle facial
exactly yeah I one of those people
I went in to go get a man he's so happy
to have you please enjoy a great sushi
and wonderful champagne my name is Jill
max I'm the owner of gold elements here

truffles we call them the diamonds gold
24-karat of real gold today you're going
to be pampered with the most expensive
facial treatment we have Cheers with
herbs to everyone get your oh I did to
mine it Oh
so the Cleopatra treatments starts with
a very deep cleanse
this is the foaming cleanser also
contains 24 karat of gold we're cleaning
the skin and preparing your skin for
absorbing the mask now we're going to
use a sewer and we're going to open in
the pores it's like a little sauna on my
face the peeling mask is next it's also
contained 24 karat gold so this one is
actually peeling there's a jointed skin
it'll also get rid of a lot of
blackheads whiteheads Cleopatra is
actually named after the queen of Egypt
her regiment was using gold daily we
actually took that regimen and we're
using it for our customers gold is a
very powerful anti-aging producing your
own collagen that will reach the deepest
layer of the keratin level that's
actually going to give you the perfect
results really fast so you're going to
massage it and it will just dissolve
into my skin yes that's so wild
this can replace injection when you're
doing injections to skin you have some
bruises you can't go out but with such
treatment you know you can look amazing
right after oh wow I kind of look like a
baby so our other facial is the truffles
white and black truffles the truffles
are actually taking care of
discoloration balancing melanin plus
it's giving you a major lift this is
really going to lift your skin so this
mask will actually get kind of warm
you're gonna feel your skin burning fat
because that the heat is really kind of
like shrinking the skin so after we're
going to take off the mask we're gonna
apply this serum and the cream to finish
Wow do you see it I do see it actually
we were talking about a little bit of
the scarring of old adding acne scars
yeah it gets rid of it permanently and
completely wow this one is a very
special magnet mask the magnet contains
essential ingredients gives us
younger looking skinn it does feel like
mud but like all the smooth parts of mud
like I don't feel any grittiness or any
like debris but the magnet where
actually everything's going to jump
towards the magnet with pulling a lot of
the dry dead skin and and bacterias and
that's how we're leaving only the
ingredients that we want getting rid of
everything from deep inside that we
don't want it so right now this is
taking out all the bacteria and bad
stuff and leaving the good stuff look at
her skin look at that it's amazing don't
feel a little bit like in a daze yeah
don't look him all the things that we
just agree with at the door sushi
champagne I kind of forgot about that
after the facial I just can't believe I
was like literally covered in my gold
foil I had only ever enjoyed eating
truffles but I might like them more on
my face I had little spikes sucked off
of my face with a magnet my face started
off a grayish hue and ended up gold
hoarding never cept we're we're giving
these luxurious gift bags as well
I have always aspired to play Cleopatra
in the Shakespearean tragedy Antony and
Cleopatra and I think today I got one
step closer to that dream so for that I
am very grateful so that was fun I had a
blast it was so good
my god the best servings of my life I
know what a fun a month-long adventure
which one was the most worth it in my
head I was like the gold facial is like
an amazing one's a lifetime opportunity
you're only going to get covered in gold
once and like it's extremely expensive
but maybe once in your life you could
make it happen I mean this season is
great the champagne was very I really
enjoyed phase house I feel like they've
really got the guns out of my pores I
kind of liked going back to my place and
doing it with you guys you know where
else are you gonna get soft Finley
fingers and Freddy's chants in the back

worth it in their own way yeah lady
