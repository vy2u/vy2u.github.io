on pee after sex pee after sex
pee after sex the hole is a lot lower
than you'd think doesn't need to be with
your one true love but it should be with
someone you care about I wish someone
had explained to me that losing your
virginity doesn't have to mean sex with
a man you could lose your virginity with
a woman the first time is gonna last all
of 30 seconds be prepared to use hands
and mouths until you're ready for round
two I wish I would have known that
there's such a thing as too much Lube
that a car is not the place to do it
water bed should be avoided by rookies
if fluids fall out of you I never knew
that sex doesn't mean love wish I would
have known that whatever song is playing
will haunt you for the rest of your life
aka make sure it's not linkin park the
blood it's never good the first time how
vulnerable I'd feel the faking it is
harder than you think it's not magical
like the movies it's awkward I wish I
knew that I was allergic to latex</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
