the Beast we'll find out
I don't usually blow dry my hair because
blow dryers tend to fry my curls and
that's not okay my hair just kind of
does whatever it feels on any given day
it's very very thick there's a lot of it
tons of volume relatively high amount of
frizz and it's just kind of like a
coarser texture my routine is I take a
shower I let it air dry and then I just
throw it up in a bun the one and only
time I've used the blow-dry was in high
school so it's been years all right so
we're gonna start off with this blow
dryer that's 20 dollars it says it's
powerful and fast drying you have the
off button and in the hot and the war
I need more options in this life but
we'll just try it out here we go if you
start with the base you're gonna end up
with a beast so if you try to tame it
first and maybe you'll end up with a
nice domesticated Beast
I already smell burning and I hate that
smell
that looks pretty good it's a little
frizzier than what it would be if I were
to air dry out this blow dryer was what
I'm used to it kept you know the typical
drying time this was a pretty pleasant
experience I think my hair looks great I
think it took about seven minutes which
actually felt longer just because I was
like sweating
thing is it gets very very hot like okay
is it dry like is that still wet or is
it just now my own sweat I'm not mad at
it but if there's a better solution out
there then I'm all for it
oh hello and welcome to your new dryer
what's so sweet
wow this feels very luxurious it feels
very hefty in my hand great fast drying
engineered for balance helps prevent
extreme heat damage to protect natural
shine so that's appealing too it's just
worth so much money that like it should
morph into like a flat iron and then the
back pulls off and it's like a built-in
comb if I were just to see this anywhere
I would have no idea that it was a blow
dryer I don't even really know which
side is the front or back it's like
space-age blow-drying it's magnetic
which is pretty rad
okay this is so cool okay you can change
the level of wind
holy cow this is a wild ride
you
it's not blowing my hair everywhere it's
just like heat energy that's very
specific I have it on the hottest
temperature and the highest air I really
want to do a good baby can do it was fun
I like the way it sounds how it's just
like with this I feel like my hair
wasn't blowing everywhere which I think
would reduce frizz it was fun to use
just because there's kind of the novelty
of having something that looks different
that feels fun it kind of like
immediately tell the difference is
definitely drying it a little more
efficient than the previous one
a $399 blow driver says a $20.00 blow
dryer for me it's definitely not worth
it if you want to gift this to me I will
take it this felt very luxurious I just
don't know that the outcome represented
how much it costs
with this particular one we use a
smoothing nozzle which I think could be
the reason why I took the same amount of
time as the previous one I will say
though that I've used a six hundred
dollar dyson vacuum cleaner and that is
completely worth the money I think it's
it's it's cool that you have options in
terms of like what you're looking for in
a blow dryer still not worth 400 bucks
if you ask me like it might be shinier
it might be a little bit faster is it
worth it
Wow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
