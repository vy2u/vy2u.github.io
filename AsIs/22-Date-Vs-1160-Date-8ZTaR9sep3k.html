psych I'm going to Ryan so Brian see
you're solving some crimes here this is
for ghosts yeah the frame this is all
about me and Ryan new growth for
magnetic fields we're going three
magical day two three magical price
points said work it that's right
wait weren't one school what's up guys
hey box has a new show called love
connection and it's all about bringing
people together and about love and
romance so today on working lifestyle we
are on our way to three days at three
drastically different price points to
find out which one is the most worth it
at its price the caveat is you had to do
it with me around with this weird
appendage the thing is if you guys going
to date who's in a filament you know
I've always thought if I was in a
romantic setting the one thing I'd like
to pan over and see is your face right
know what you ever does a joke I would
never want to see that people have been
asking me for a worth it unsolved
crossover so I thought you know I could
bring you in changing the date but I
think I don't want to make Helen jealous
or anything yeah I don't think I want to
go on a date with Shane may be kind of
cute I want to tell us about yourself
I'm a CPA but don't ask me to do your
taxes oh I forgot to tell you the theme
today Jesus our theme today is
adrenaline love romance Act one what my
name is Michelle Sarah skyzone is the
world's first trampoline park it is
wall-to-wall trampolines it's like a
perfect place for a date you get an
opportunity to really get to know people
it's like their inner child comes out
there are four basic components of skies
on there's main court which you're
standing on right now with endless
trampoline then you have a basketball a
film zone and you can flip into it you
could just jump straight in the last
major component is to play dodgeball I
don't think I'm very good at dodgeball I
think I would get destroyed there's no
better way to get to know somebody and
be on a date that to smack them with the
ball at high velocity they're right
smack the ball high velocity the word
yeah well it's a cheap day so you guys
only have a half an hour so chop-chop
wha
Oh
no stop following me hey what are you
reading for me this is supposed to be a
date try the wall but don't hurt
yourself I don't wanna take care of you
that's the owner oh you want to try the
wall Helen nope
cool try once just throw your way to do
it oh my god you want to go play
dodgeball I'll try the foam pit all
right okay you got it hey girl I'm
coming in you Angie I follow I think
actually it's kind of hard to get out
here just roll out roll out it's like oh
she's so mean I think it's time for some
basketball really of a glory days the
pass right now I used to be able to dunk
well you got that I have footage of it
what do you do is like jump you just
jump and put the ball in the hoop oh
it's a dunk you gotta have some anger in
the duck it's a dunk you gotta take out
your emotion I'm gonna go for 360 and
now for the grand finale this is the
biggest hoop we got here yeah I miss ya
you like hey Duncan you're gonna hit it
with the Jay right here
what's a Jay okay okay wait
oh I hit it I did it
oh no headshot all right look at you
Ryan I'm not gonna hit Helen in the head
with the Dodge I'd hit you in the head
you go first
I'm just saying I'm apologizing because
now you have to die you get a free shot
at me I'm so sorry oh wait wait wait
wait wait I said a free shot there's a
fire that went into your eyes hold on
hold on take it easy take it easy
yeah I wasn't that bad thank God you'll
never get me get you far oh are you okay
dad who they won Oh God
well that was fun yeah I was really fun
I'm very sweaty iron you still look good
though I feel like I look like a mess
yeah you do
that was the part where she's supposed
to be like all you look fine too but
that's what a nice person I ever said
that that's sure you're not very nice I
feel like this might be more fun with
like friends like a big group of people
yeah it is a little weird playing
one-on-one dodgeball with your
girlfriend what do you guys think a
skyzone I was trying to get you to throw
down some Monster Jam
I was trying it was the nicest dunk I've
ever seen thank you no not like that was
always that was nice okay you ready what
are we doing here what's the appropriate
answer to your question hey guys hit me
our recent study showed that subjects
who went through 15 minutes of exercise
found people of the opposite sex more
attractive than without the exercise
these are perhaps because the act of
exercise and moving around brings out
our primal instincts where you got to go
like you know mate is that weird for
your second date your date is actually
planned by Andy Cohen who is the host of
love connects via satellite device let's
see it hey brah hey Helen and Ryan the
second date you're gonna be going on
today is an escape room essentially your
idiot locked in a room together you have
one hour to escape not only will it be
fun but it will be a great test of your
chemistry good luck guys we're gonna get
out of this room I'm confident in us
hello even if you aren't promise me one
thing when things get tense we can't
turn on each other okay fine we'll do it
oh my god this is gonna be a disaster
I'm Angelique I'm your game master today
escape moves in general they're good for
anything and everything I think it's a
perfect like first date because you're
literally locked in a room with somebody
and yeah if you guys can work together
don't worry I got this I do this for a
living
we're gonna be fine yeah well we put you
guys in a mini movie scene where the
puzzles actually are parts of the
storyline argh a mess against a
character for you as well - also she
sees everything so no man oh yeah cuz
that's a huge problem always updated
everything's in this room right your
general tip is communication it's Kate
it's my milk I'm interested as touch
foreheads mind up are you guys ready
yeah ready to get that bill I think
we're ready to do this
here's your guy this time get that yeah
what they arguing begin she said that
you don't take pictures off the wall but

open I don't think that's where we start
I think we start with like drawers and
stuff what about these books maybe
there's hidden like oh look this one's
Hollow what about here this little cigar
box let's say there's a key all right
I'm scared huh it doesn't look like it

kind of key there's got to be a safe in

United States Presidents hey know where

my god I think you guys did amazing
reaching my hand the gross mouse was not
my favorite part but I thought we worked
well as a team
do you mind if I touch you with my heart
Oh dig that oh is that what that is a
time for a date back 22 percent of
Millennials believe that technology has
made finding love harder than ever
before yeah that checks out it scans for
me and actually it feels like it should
be more than 22 percent it should be
like 80% of bolonia yeah
tinder Bumble the what love is it yeah I
mean it could be it could be for a night
all right here we go the final date guys
is going to be a date that's over $1,000
my home is a lovely sunrise hot air
balloon ride across Temecula oh my gosh
I have some thoughts when it why why
first off I'm scared of heights
that's awesome I'm very scared I really
I'm really excited I'm also scared of
heights oh great
and so it's gonna be us Horning on
however new life way are you gonna be in
the basket with us of course it's gonna
tell me that it was gonna be in the
bathroom with us how big is this basket
good morning everybody I'm Dan Glick I'm
the senior pilot for sunrise balloons
you've got a beautiful day for your
balloon flight we're going to do a
little sightseeing a lot of rolling
hills and beautiful scenery I am a
little scared of heights so we've had
many people that are afraid of heights
it's very secure and an overall peaceful
perspective we meet 30 minutes before
sunrise then we're transported to
wherever the balloons are launching with
a beautiful party bus once the balloons
are inflated and ready for launch
passengers aboard it and we have
refreshments on board and then it's off
for sightseeing adventuring and
exploring the Temecula Valley the
sharing and experience of romance
adventure forms a bit of a bond whether
it's your first date or last dating I
should say look how cute the basket is
oh boy okay we're doing this shut up
Steven that's a big-ass balloon oh that
fire oh you know me the craziest way to
die is if that flame thrower
accidentally liked the hint broke and it
went down and just incinerated us inside
the balloon in the sky oh my god war you
guys look at--look with mine okay it's
really casual keep drinking for the
 Shane take the edge off you know
all right now it's not that bad when you
look down no it's real easygoing for you
so beautiful
how are you I'm just trying to take in
the beauty and like forget that we're
flooding in destroy them out of the air
it's very very safe
just another romantic date with Steven
what are we gonna do now when we go on
dates without Steven I don't know it's
gonna feel like something's missing
yeah it really is cool to see the
shadows have you gotten a shot of that
Steve I'm scared to look down to be
honest yes still pretty terrifying
this is amazing pretty cool totally
unique this is an experience that you
wouldn't get in any other kind of
vehicle oops if I get you a pretty place
to sit down you want to put a little
heat in it
just to keep it coming in kind of soft
because we don't want to bounce it
so we got here at like 4 o'clock in the
morning was very cold
we went airborne I panicked a little bit
Stephen peed himself I did not he nobody
Stephen peed his pants once I got over
my fear of heights I was fine I was
truly able to take in the beauty of the
valley how do you feel find you I'm real
proud of myself it was really nice to
like be with him up there it's almost
like comically beautiful it's almost
like it's a good car cheers tears that's
having a head but that's oh yeah I was a
real convincing before me okay I pretend
like there's something in there there's
nothing your name still can't really
believe we did that that far exceeded my
expectations
I did not think it was gonna be so
peaceful which date was the most worth
it for you guys at its given price the
trampoline was fun for the price just to
be active I was a little hard to talk to
each other but still a great time that
being said I would say my worth it
winner would be the escape route
nice that's the best first date in my
opinion where you could really figure
out who you are dating what do you find
about out of that when the pressures on
the heat is on she's able to work that
noggin I deliver the hot air baloon was
definitely my favorite experience
however
the price tag that comes with that I
think is a little steep therefore my
worth it winner will also have to be the
escape room it is definitely more
affordable it allows you to interact
with whoever you're with in a really fun
and exciting way so you guys are wrong
this game room was fun it was awesome
and I will say that we got to go back on
a double date there however I got to go
with the high roller strategy here with
the hot-air balloon day that's my were
that winner today that's all it takes
for Stephens a little worth it hard to
sing right there yeah make sure to check
out love connection premiering Thursday
May 25th on Fox</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
