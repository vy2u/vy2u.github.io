like you're naked but still like keep
your butt up there guess it's supposed
to be leisure athletic wear but I don't
know how to rock it when I shop for
leggings I try to look for bottoms that
aren't seafood I'm excited to get out of
my $10 legging zone and see what how the
other half lives with their fancy
leggings the pocket I don't know what
you and keep in there I think my butt
looks good in this it's always a factor
if you don't mind people seeing your
underwear bear your pair for style I
would say you feel like a four they're
pretty cool I would give them a 3.5 or
four I would compliment someone wearing
these leggings so I feel like that
deserves before so not into these
whippings but I'm definitely conscious
of the leggings on my body because I
feel those seams I would write working
out in these leggings as a lunch okay I
would give them a two just because I
know if I was sweating more I would be
able to start seeing my sweat sinking
through
this is like night and day it's pretty
long I feel like a lot of leggings don't
cater to short people as evidenced by my
sock legging situation I feel like I
know what I'm doing when I have these on
and I guess that does make me feel like
Beyonce cuz that girl has our shit
together they're pretty good right now
thick fabric I like that stretchy
comfortable style wise I think I would
rate this as three just because solid
black yes there is some design but I
don't feel like I get that butt lift
that I'm looking for
however it is it like a 3/4 style I
would give them a four and a half I feel
like all these leggings are like ah give
me out of them I don't know if there's
gonna be anything better than this I'm
maybe gonna give her five I would write
the Ivy Park ladies as a one four
workout ability they ride too much I
hate having to like lift up my leggings
all the time if you're gonna pay $65 if
they better and hope you doing that at
all yeah I'm not a fan of these leggings
because they're synthetic blend so I
think that might be more of my problem
than fiance's
$200 for these leggings I feel the most
comfortable in these Nietzsche leggings
actually and maybe I should cuz they're
$200 these are like the first two
combined and have like a magical baby
that's like thinner and trendier than
both of them
I would compare these leggings to a
second layer of skin so I've decided
that I hate expensive leggings and that
they're for tall people who don't like
their crotches to breathe
they're like sexy they're they're like
super hot I think it's like got the
sheer stuff going on here and it's like
fishnet stuff here
they're pretty stretchy and they leave
room for the extra booty like it's
definitely comfortable in the derriere
you know they can't win me over with
their fancy little lines and they're
they're netting no thank you
yeah I would rate them really I like
five or six if I can go that high the
Miche leggings I like the most for style
and rate them as a three but they're
still not a size I would give them like
a four they're pretty cute I just don't
understand how anyone could work out in
any of these leggings because they're
just like so unbreathable I would give
them a five let's me a five for working
out too I would say they're like a three
again to sweaty
I never thought leggings would be an
item to splurge on but like they are and
now I get it
feel like my search for the perfect
legging is going to be a long journey
ahead of me it's not over yet maybe one
day I will definitely invest in high-end
looking's from now on I feel like we
should just get rid of leggings all
together
and just start being naked when we work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
