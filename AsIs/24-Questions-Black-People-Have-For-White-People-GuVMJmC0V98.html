decisions in horror movies it's not cool
to split up
why do you freak out when black people
are cast to play white fictional
characters what's the big deal with the
Drizella plays James Bond
I will go see it twice why is a big butt
and big lips considered attractive on a
white woman but they're unattractive on
a black woman do y'all really think
miley is the one who created twerking
really why am I supposed to teach you
how to twerk I don't know how to twerk
why is it that white people always act
as though they have discovered a new
trend when people of color have been
doing it for virtually years why is it
when a black woman wears her hair
natural it's seen as inappropriate when
a white woman does it sprays this is the
hair that I was born with so you wearing
it as a trend is not cute like can you
appropriate my student loans can you
take that off my hands why isn't the
white crime is seen as an isolated
incident
but black crime is a representation of
my entire community when we see a story
on TV about a white serial killer
I don't automatically assume that all
white people must be serial killers too
why does talking about race make you
feel so uncomfortable is it because you
think that you'll be perceived as a
racist if you talk about race you don't
really believe that racism is over
because we have a black president why is
it so easy for you to notice when there
are no white people around but you
hardly ever notice when there are no
black people around why is your goal to
be colorblind there's so many different
types of people in the world yeah you
can't see color why do you want to say
the n-word so badly if I don't use it
what makes you think you can why do you
always want to touch our hair who told
you it was okay to touch people without
their permission why do you feel like
having one black friend makes you a
cultural expert or not a racist is your
only black friend comfortable with being
the reason why you can't be racist by
that logic then I'm not racist I have a
ton of white friends why do you feel
comfortable cursing at your parents why
do you kiss your dogs on the mouth
how come you can't pronounce black names
like LaVon genetics but can say names
like Swartz nigger Galifianakis and the
buff just fine
why do you feel like all lions lives
matter but black lives done why is a
lion's life in Africa more important
than the lives of black people here in
America what does somebody Berdoo for
you I get it
Lion King was an awesome movie pasilla
Selma and so was Malcolm X why is it so
hard for you to acknowledge your
privilege how does it feel to not be
this book's person for your entire race
at any given time must be nice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
