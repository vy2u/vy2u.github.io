Chinese that's like me saying to like a
white person hey you're English hey why
do you think a film or TV show is
diverse just because there are one or
two black people in it we're here - why
are the awkward nerd characters the only
roles available for Asians and film we
do a lot of other stuff - why are all of
you talking about our penises why do you
think Asians can't be the stars of
movies there aren't gonna be any Asian
celebrities out there to cast if we
haven't been given a chance yet why do
you think watching Korean dramas and
kpop makes you an expert on Korean
culture like there's me watching girls
make me an expert in white culture it
does why do you pass white people to
play roles that are meant for Asian
people I'm not gonna forget Emma Stone
why do you think saying namaste is an
appropriate way to greet me why do you
think say me how is a good thing to say
to us if you're not actually gonna
converse with me in Chinese I don't need
to hear it why do you need dogs I'm two
dogs why do you think that Hindi and
Hindu are the same thing why are you so
surprised that I can speak English well
I was born in America what you always
ask me where are you really from because
obviously I'm from my mom's vagina why
do you guys think it's okay to call me
an immigrant or foreigner I was born in
America why do you think Indians aren't
Asians India is literally India
why do you say it's basically the same
thing when I tell you I'm from Sri Lanka
and not India there are different
countries why does a person of color
automatically mean black to you I'm a
person of color - why do you think all
brown people are Indian why do you think
you deserve a high-five for pronouncing
my name correctly why do you think
including diversity in the workplace
reduces the quality of work I thought
you thought we were all nerds why do you
think it's okay to call me exotic I mean
technically we're the largest part of
the world population associate and why
people be exotic why do you think I
can't see properly
you really think my eyes are that small
why is it weird when all Asian people
hang out but it's fine when all white
people hang out so tell me what is a
sunburn feeling why do you keep trying
to justify yellow I don't know why they
use fever for all these things it's not
a disease it's just why are we being
stereotyped as cheap or stingy they
didn't just cost-efficient why do you
think all Asian people are smart and
when I was in high school there was a
Korean validator no actually there was
an Indian valedictory
I guess you guys are right Asians are
smart
have you tried that here my people
restaurant there's like a mayonnaise
dish that is sir man easy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
