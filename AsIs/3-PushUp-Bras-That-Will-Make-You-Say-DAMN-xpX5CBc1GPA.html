padded who needs bike helmets just get a
bombshell bra Wonderbra whoa
it's like built-in chicken cutlets kind
of it's a tear or something this is like
NASA technology that we now use to hold
up people's - it's comfortable it feels
like a foam mattress this one's fun to
squish I like this it's doing the
push-up bra thing we're like anytime I
move feels like my whole chest is moving
every okay there's a lot of stuff going
on under here - feels like a bra that
actually fits it's just like a little
kind of boost from the bottom here it's
not like a crazy drastic change like I
expect a push-up bra to turn me into
Jessica Rabbit woah what the sways like
six pounds Oh Oh what do real boobs feel
like water hmm you know this makes me
think of as the bras that you can put
like booze in that I would get that
sounds like it has a practical use the
first bra is like tempur-pedic this is
like 1970s waterbed this I would be
nervous about this like leaking whoa I
can definitely like see a difference
it's so awkward cuz the water is cold
this one is not doing the same effect
that I want it to do there's just like a
glob of water like sitting in front of
my boobs and it's really strange because
it's just adding water to your boobs
instead of instead of pushing everything
up this isn't actually a push-up Roxy
this is what I want that feel like a
boob no no you can tell there's like a
plastic bag in there they move naturally
when I go like this it's like like
that's I'm not grabbing any boob right
now I don't like it as much if my
boyfriend ever felt me up laws wearing
this bra he doesn't what the heck is
going on under there the bombshell oh my
god this is all pad holy crap from here
to here just padding where does your
boob go oh this is cute I'm gonna wear
this for Halloween next year how
expensive is this thing she don't want
to know looks yeah 50 bucks wasted day
I'm holding them and they don't even
feel like mine I feel like I'm strapped
into a bulletproof vest right now
because that's a big thing I feel like
I'm lying this looks nice though I got a
boyfriend before I finish laughing in
this thing I feel like I'm about to
spill out of it because there's no
actual room for my boobs in this I can't
stop looking at myself at this brother
but I imagine that's the problem is like
a dude would just be looking at my chest
but it's not uncomfortable these aren't
as uncomfortable as I thought they would
be if I wanted to hook up with someone I
just met while wearing this bra I would
probably be okay with doing most things
except anything in this area I would
just be so nervous and so self-conscious
that my actual boobs we're gonna
disappoint them you know nothing looks
so sexy is just being naked and like
I'll have to pay $50 for that if
somebody gets to see your boobs they're
gonna be excited so just take the bra
live your best life they're not gonna be
like whoa that was a lot of padding I
would just want to like encourage people
to embrace their own bodies but at the
same time if you're really insecure
about something go ahead and change it
like whatever you do you there was an
earthquake and you were wearing this and
you did emergency water got it right
open like if Tom Hanks is running this
me castaway would have been like oh good
I got at least a day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
