than 20 seconds to get stopped by the
police my name is Brian Wolfe
I am a handsome 30 year old man some
Keith I'm a beautiful 27 year old boy
I'm marquise and he I'm 29 looking fine
I am back at my alma mater to party like
we used to so the plan is we're gonna
try to drink as much as we can play beer
pong have fun and right now it's the
Foursquare marathon and if we were still
in college that would mean we would go
to the force for a marathon really late
and drunkenly play Foursquare
I fell down probably got a bruise but at
the end we'll just see if all of this is
still fun or if maybe we've grown out of
it we used to play a game called scepter
scepter where you would tape the next
beer to the top of the one you just
finished as you drank you'd slowly get a
longer and longer scepter and I am the
wind and never got one that was more
than probably seven tonight you know
because now I'm older and wiser I think
I can get to eight if I can accomplish
that I'll prove that I can do everything
I used to do in college but even better
and hopefully I'll still be able to make
it through the whole weekend there's
much god damnit Kiki I'm confessional
five years five septa has five well men
we went to the party and there were lots
of fun people there and I started to
scepter I got about three in before it
you could really feel anything but then
move in on people let's party around
five I was wandering around the party
doing dramatic GoPro party
cinematography then I interviewed Brian
who I felt would be a good authority on
effective college partying so what you
look for in a party companion someone
who rocking it and through a combination
of drunk food pepperoni sausage green
peppers and onions and adult strategy I
was able to get to eight beers which is
I guess my new record I had an awesome
time but I did get a little tired at the
end stayin awake was a bigger challenge
I think than drinking at some point so
as fun as this is I don't miss having it
be an all-consuming lifestyle because I
like being able to get up and be
productive and do the things that I care
when I went to this college I used to
host a lot of parties here and so my
goal for tonight is to try and take over
the party I'm going to try and get
people to do activities to join me and
just make the whole event about me
got everybody to chant some things got
dance party going so that was good and
then was able to take over the
Foursquare Court by becoming King Square
for longest reign of the time we were
there so that made me feel good the beer
pong games I was humbled at first I
forgot how I needed to focus but once
Keith and I were able to get it together
in focus ease into it
yeah Dido was so delicious I got the
Maui wowie which has jalapeno as ham
cheese and but this morning I am feeling
that food
I'd say the college lifestyle has made
me feel fat I definitely can tell why I
weighed 30 pounds more in college okay I
felt incredibly successful at this point
we've outlasted most of the actual
college students but I also felt a
little sad for the college students
because they couldn't party the same way
that we did one of the objectives I have
is to play beer pong and win a game of
beer pong I will have to play beer pong
until I went because I used to win
I haven't played beer pong in a long
time we're doing it
it was crazy night played beer pong lost
the first game tried to be a celebrity
guest another game but then played
another game of beer pong me and B will
really embrace the true nature of beer
pong which is to say something together
with your partner every time you're
about to shoot so now it gets you in the
zone me and Mark tried to chug a beer
faster than a girl couldn't both college
students beat both of us and the
chugging contest March didn't even try
we went to Foursquare I fell down
got DP doe though we've got to order
ranch that was the worst mistake of the
night when you're drunk you want our
ranch I didn't get it but today I'm
pretty hungover we're gonna go eat some
shepherd's pie at an Irish pub and we're
gonna perform in diapers because that's
what we used to do all the time that's
it right we do it you know romanette
bottle there is no room in this bottle
we drank it all we practiced our bit and
now we're ready to go to theater of
death sOooo gassy from the road I feel
gassy from the road Brian
ready for diapers I'm so ready for
diapers I had such a great time at the
college partying just like we used to
was really fun but I also enjoy being
sober
if you want to go back and relive
college you can it was very fun I had a
great time it's not that as an adult I
don't wanna have fun and party and stay
up late I just have better things to do
with my day I think if you believe in
yourself and you want to live that
garbage life you can do it
so you can't go back a party but you're
gonna have a headache</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
