fried chicken I love fried chicken it
should be a white person stereotype
because of me why do we make it so we
only have pumpkin in the fall I want
pumpkin all the time why can't most
white people dance seriously like is it
genetic or something do they like stiff
hips are like two left feet I can dance
why do you get so annoyed when other
people don't speak English English is
hard
we have silent K's why do we get so
excited to brag on Instagram that we
went to this really cool authentic
cultural festival even though we went
with all of our white friends why do
white people spray tan until they turn
orange can't you just be comfortable in
your own body I'm just saying it's not
Han it's orange why do you think that
since you've seen five seasons of The
Wire you're a cultural expert why do you
believe everything you see on TV when it
comes to other races why do we get upset
when a TV show becomes diverse even
though a diverse usually just means two
to three people of color why do you
assume movies with white stars are
automatically more relatable than movies
with people of color people of color
have had to relate to white characters
for all of cinematic history
why is Viola Davis the first black woman
to win an Emmy for Best Actress why
aren't we complaining that the Oscars
and other award shows are like all white
it's just like white people
congratulating other white people on
being white everybody should be
represented why don't we know the
difference between appropriation and
appreciation why can't we figure out how
to make our own pop culture our own
slang our own cool clothes instead of
stealing other people's cool clothes and
then saying that they are our cool
clothes why are white people obsessed
with Wes Anderson why would you ever say
thug life it's a bad life what do you
have against seasoning and spiciness
then Christopher Columbus discover
America looking for spices or casseroles
our thing why do you try to avoid
confrontation at all cost why is it
crazy that I'm white and I'm a big butt
why do you make such a big deal when
somebody doesn't want to hike
why do you keep talking about reverse
racism that is not a thing
we are the people in power racism is
about oppression sorry white people have
not been oppressed why are you too
afraid to speak up when someone says
something racist why do we think that
having one friend of color means that
nothing we say or do could possibly ever
be raised
why does being half white automatically
make my commentary on white culture only
half truth I am just as much white as I
am Mexican why do you believe that black
lives matter means that your life
doesn't matter every life matters it's
just that one has heart of time living
why do you get offended when you see a
table full of black people but not when
you see a lunchroom full of white people
why do you always ask to have a white
people Club you already do it's a
student union it's primarily white they
have a Black Student Union because you
don't represent them well why do you see
the success of people of color as a
threat to you you know that a two-minute
video about whiteness isn't reverse
racism right two minutes about whiteness
hundreds of years of systemic oppression
yeah I think we can deal with this why
are we upset about immigrants when we
were the first immigrants and we were
white people running away from other
white people that kind of shows you how
about white people can be</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
