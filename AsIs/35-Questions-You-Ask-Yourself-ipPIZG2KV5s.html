you regret from yesterday no you're good
is that a new freckle wait have you
always have this many freckles are you
getting skinnier okay what do you have
to do today have you paid your rent have
you paid your student loans have you
called your mom recently to have your
phone keys wallet okay how have you
lived here this long and never noticed
how beautiful your neighborhood is what
if you get into a car crash bang and you
die who would come to your funeral who
would read your eulogy is it weird that
you think about that
are you getting fatter what if you keep
working this hard and you never achieve
your dreams what if you're just not good
enough what if you've always been good
enough and you're the only thing that's
holding you back isn't that worse are
you failing at this social interaction
does he know you like him well that day
wasn't that bad was it why can't you
just be on time for once in your life
was that breakup your fault what about
that other one what if people see you
differently than you see yourself are
you hot enough for him are you too good
for him
what if you're settling what if all the
people who will ever love you already
have and everything Kiran out is just a
lesser version of that why are you so
much harder on yourself than you are on
other people what if you are good enough
what if you make all of your dreams
happen what if everything is going to be
okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
