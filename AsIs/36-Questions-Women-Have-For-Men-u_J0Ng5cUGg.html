Donald Trump why do you hate rom-coms or
do you just feel like you need to hate
them everybody likes the notebook
everybody likes Beyonce it's just a fact
why do you make women sit around and
talk about men and movie and y'all
easily just sit around and talk about
boobs for hours why do you automatically
assume that you won't like TV or movies
that star a female lead why are you
surprised when women are funny I'm
probably funnier than you why do you
think that we're obsessed with you when
we hook up nine times out of ten I just
want to leave to I'm busy I got to
do why can't I sleep with as many people
as I want to without being judged when
men do it they're congratulating why do
you consider a woman a tease if she
doesn't sleep with you after three dates
but a if she sleeps with you on the
first day in what world's is no mania no
means no why do you say that women are
too emotional to be leaders then justify
catcalling by saying men just can't
control themselves why do you think that
just because you're nice to me I owe you
my body why would you ever send an
unsolicited dick pic why do you feel
like it's okay to harass women or make
offensive comments about women but when
somebody does it to your sister it's not
okay how does it feel to interrupt me
when I'm in the middle of making a point
during a meeting why do you have to sit
with your legs so wide open I get that
you have balls but I don't stand around
with my arms wide open to make room for
my boobs why are women perceived as the
weaker sex even though we literally
birth you like watermelons through like
this why is it so bad to show your
emotion it means you're human why are
you always trying to prove your
masculinity to me why the isn't it
ladylike to cuss when dude words get
genders why is it your first instinct to
doubt women who have been sexually
violated or rates why do you assume a
woman's angry because she's on her
period why do you think women that wear
makeup or false advertising we can say
the same thing about your dick size why
isn't it weird that there's a bunch of
old white men sitting in a room making
legislation about what I can and can't
do with my body do you have a Gucci wire
straight guy
so obsessed with lesbians how does it
feel to get kicked in the balls you ever
get tired of trying to be manly all the
time why are you so afraid of gender
equality why do I deserve to be paid
less than you in what world does 77
cents equal a dollar in what world is 68
says equal a dollar how is that fair why
are you intimidated by a woman who makes
more money than you that's awesome
more money why are opinionated women
seen as bitches
when opinionated men are seen as bosses
why aren't you speaking up when you hear
your male friends behind closed doors
make jokes that are offensive to women
why are you so afraid of recognizing
your own privilege doesn't mean you're a
bad person just recognize it and do
something about it
