things that don't make any sense
airplanes airplanes they have these tiny
propellers on the sides it feels like
that wouldn't help much since the entire
plane is like 3,000 pounds weight how
much is actually weigh can you sit up
what the this says a 747 weighs 800
thousand pounds is that's ridiculous
I don't even know how that's possible
cruise ships why are there cruise ships
these are my cruise ship concerns what
if all the food goes bad and everyone
gets food poisoning that happens
remember I think it happened that it
happens a lot ghost hunter okay first of
all ghosts don't appear to those looking
for them has that ever happened isn't
gonna be like I'm gonna look for a ghost
ghost like what up right here ghost
proven no it always happens to the
person who like is like ghosts don't
exist
yeah the ghost is like oh hey look at
these guys at these infrared cameras now
seems like a great time for some
haunting yeah no they definitely doesn't
happen why are you looking for the ghost
okay the last one is zebras imagine that
you're the first people in the world to
see a zebra just walking along the
grasslands you're like oh you're used to
horses you're used to lying I used to
water buffalo I don't know
hippos maybe you know I'm not an expert
I've only seen the lion grasslands so
yeah we're going off the Lion King here
and okay you're just like yeah chill
I get what animals are boom zebra what
like why what come the Caesar lyric most
come from this grassland animals are
like super neutral colors great browns
you got your tans I got maybe gray a
black zebra they're like nope
come at me lions it's cool I don't give
a zebras literally give zero they don't
they give so ever I think everybody
should Google zebras right now
look at those zebras and think about how
strange they are and then everybody
should try to be more like zebras living
up life giving nope about how different
they are
the end be like a zebra that is the
moral of this story be like zebras the
end</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
