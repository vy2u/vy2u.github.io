this on it's kind of still look
good and that's what I mean in my life
one of my most life-changing products is
this flower velvet lip chubby which is a
really weird name from our Lord and
Savior drew Barrymore if anyone doesn't
know she has a beauty line called flower
that's sold at Walmart and a bunch of
drugstores so all of the products are
super affordable so I tried this little
crayon it kind of reminds me of the old
Clinique chubby stick it's essentially
that kind of model and it comes in a
bunch of different colors this is called
Barrymore which is obviously for true
and it goes on pretty matte but it's not
really drying at all and it lasts for a
really long time I've tried a couple of
the other colors of this I love them
just as much but this is just the one
that if they ever discontinued it I'm
gonna need to go find your paramour and
like demand the formula for it because
it's too good
a lovely woman by the name of Robin
Rihanna Fenty came out with a makeup
line and she has these awesome
foundations it's a 40 shade range which
is like super dope I had to wear Finn T
for a project that I was working on and
I was like OMG it really is amazing
foundation and you're probably wondering
why I have to so here's the deal
this is shade 420 and this is like you
know a good like shade for like all over
my face when I'm being lazy and just
wanna you know do something quick and
playful and this is shaped for 30 so
when I feel like I have a little bit
more energy I will create a little bit
more dimension you know what I'm saying
and really you know really spent on him
I didn't do it today because it was a
lazy day but I will do 4:20 in the
center of my face and then 4:30 on the
perimeter also it just looks really good
all throughout the day there does not
matter what time you put this on
it's gonna still look good and that's
what I need in my life because I want to
look good all the time super excited to
tell you about my secret weapon for
clear and beautiful skin it's called at
wah it's a skin care company that was
started by this lady her name is Toba
and she is like my favorite person in
the world I met her at an indie fair
earlier this year and just when I saw
her I was like this is who I want to be
when I'm older and then she just started
talking about her product and her
skincare line there's different ones for
different skin types so this is the one
she gave me and my face felt so smooth
and like bright and like alive that I
was just like I don't care if it's gonna
take me 30 minutes to wash my face every
night I'm gonna start using this product
for at least a week to see if I notice
the difference and I definitely saw the
difference I feel like my skin just kind
of threw up all this like crap and the
way it works is kind of like a jelly
extra cleanser and you put it all over
your face and then you're supposed to
wipe it off with like a cotton you're
not supposed to wash it off and I know
double cleansing is the thing it's not
like I'm here discovery but it was a
discovery for me so it definitely
changed
the way I clean my face and I don't even
wear foundation that much anymore
because I feel like I've gotten my skin
to a place where I'm confident enough to
be like these are my freckles and this
is my skin and I think they look great
thanks to this so I would recommend
everyone to give this cleanser and toner
a try
and then let me know what you think
because this is my favorite discovery
and also if you ever get to meet Oba
you'll know why I'm in love with her so
my life-changing product that I want to
tell you guys about is this this is the
sugar SPF tinted moisturizer for your
lips and this is in the color tulip and
I'm actually wearing it right now this
is one of my favorite things because I
have a lot of issues finding a really
nice lipstick because my lips are always
very dry like I hate this season right
now because everything is matte like
everything is matte right now so it just
completely dries out my lips and it's
awful like completely awful so I like to
use this a lot because it's super
moisturizing and it has a little bit of
SPF in it it just glides on really well
really easily and it's nicely pigmented
it's not too over-the-top it's like just
enough but one cool feature about this
you know when you have it in your bag
and like it opens automatically and now
suddenly have lipstick all over inside
of your bag well this is actually kind
of a twist and then come off and that's
a really cool feature and this isn't the
only shade that this comes in fresh has
a ton of different shades that comes in
the style of lipstick so can go for all
all shades of people
today I want to talk to you guys about
CLE cosmetics see CC creams triple C
cream there is apparently something
called micro capsule technology in this
product and also big kicker is there is
SPF in it SPF 45 which is really awesome
because that's just one less product you
have to put on in the morning on top of
all the other genic you're putting on
your face it's just like a really cool
all-in-one product and it's got really
good coverage which if you're like an
old wizened cone like me you want really
thick coverage the other cool thing
about it is that it comes out of the
tube white as you mix it it turns into
the color of the foundation that it's
going to be which is kind of cool it's
just like oh nice one and done like if
you don't feel like doing a lot of steps
in your makeup routine you can put this
on and like put do your eye makeup and
go and now I'm covered in makeup so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
