really big sign that reads I'm the boss
and he kept flaunting it like it was
some kind of reminder like oh look at me
I'm a big bad boss you have to do what I
say but the next day like a god-sent
there was a post-it on the bottom of the
sign in big bold letters your wife wants
our sign back
oh do you mind if I use the bathroom
real quick
Oh No
let me get this I'm sure I'm doing far
better financially so it's the only
rational decision whoa what are you
doing hey do you want to split it I know
that might insinuate that this was a bad
date but I actually had a really good
time let's split the check
I don't want to overstep my bounds and
assume you're not a really strong
independent person unbelievable
people have no decency today so where
are my friends Yeah right we're just
hanging out having a good time and he's
like hey Ted want some pizza I'm like
dude what a yacht all right a boat
surrounded by water all set oh wow you
pay for me
you didn't have to can't call me a
member of course I can pay for myself I
make my own money I pay my own bills of
course I can pay for my food I swear the
the check is the most nerve-wracking
part of her first day it's almost like
everything comes down to this crazy
point you know do you uh you want to
take off do you want to head out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
