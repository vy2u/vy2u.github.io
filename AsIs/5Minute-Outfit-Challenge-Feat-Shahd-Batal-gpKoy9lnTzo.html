breaking out oh my god oh gosh okay
today we have shad here and we're doing
5-minute fashion face-off to the death I
just thought it would be funny they like
to the to the death maybe not
we have Chad's in the building all right
she'll have to find an outfit for me and
vice versa in five minutes that
represent spring how would you describe
your style I like my basics I like my
plain black turtlenecks and like my mom
jeans and I just like to style my basics
in different ways all the time so
basically whatever I wake up in the
morning and I feel like wearing I don't
really have a style like I could be very
girly very boyish one day okay
however I'm feeling what about you how
would you describe your style I also
really like basics you I like layering
even though I'm wearing yellow today I
usually have at least something like
black or like darker or like a beige on
me at all time so hate to break it to
you but there is a challenge today we
have one item that's a surprise item I
don't even know what it is and we have
to design the whole outfit around that
one surprise item so are you ready for
this challenge I'm a little nervous a
little intimidated but I'm excited I'm
nervous too especially because of going
again literally a fashion blogger we all
have like our inner fashion bloggers
that's you know we can do this I love
that we all have our inner possible
you're going first
so um good luck all right so what's the
item actually you know what it's not as
bad as I thought it was gonna be I can
do something with this oh it is kind of
bad okay not sure what I'm gonna do with
this but you know what it's gonna be
okay
to one go alright so initially I wanted
to use the yellow because I know that I
love yellow in the springtime okay so I
didn't like this pop of color with the
red so I think this would be really cute
accent pant the heck is this gonna match
not that oh my gosh this is so much
pressure we're gonna do the black and
white stripe thing with the red I know
you're thinking you don't mean to do it
but I'm gonna do it so we're definitely
don't to break anything we're gonna do
denim jacket for sure because denim
screams spring to me let's do a mutated
job and go with black we're doing black
everybody I don't want to do it too much
blocks but we're gonna do these cuz
these are like my favorite pants like
some pleated loose pants we're gonna use
the hat too you know what why not oh
don't fall I'm a really big fan of like
mixing patterns and color and things
that are unexpected so I might just do
this so I think that if she wears this
necklace it'll really pull the attention
from all the black happening to the
color and don't bring up at the bread
pants because that is really gonna cut
this outfit apart I think I'm gonna do
this mustardy scarf because I do think
of yellow what I think of the spring so
we'll do mustard so we do have another
pop of color this is kind of a lot
happening we're gonna do it we're gonna
do it there's no looking back so I'm
thinking about having her tuck in this
sure wait no I'm like I don't know if I
should do this anymore
now I'm double guessing everything I'm
doing she did this leather skirt no
that's too black that's too much black
dang it why did you have to give me this
ugly piece that's ruining all of my
ideas that I had there's literally
nothing that will match it like nothing
hopefully all of it will outweigh this
one necklace because it's so ugly that I
can't even look at it anymore
oh my god
so I think I'm just going to stick to a
blacktop because we're gonna do a little
bit of color blocking with the scarf and
just ugly necklace pleated pants because
these are so like cozy and flowy and
then a denim jacket which is my favorite
this is like the perfect length you're
okay
so I picked your outfit I picked your
outfit sorry dude man please don't hate
weak close your eyes okay I already
sound ugly there you go okay here's
your's
okay let's get changed in these outfits
and I'm really sorry again please those
go I could like hear your outfit you
look like you're 1995 Janet Jackson
music video but I want to know in what
world orange and blue matter red ring
means color so I was like let's do a red
pant ready and right now red is in it's
a color I call it the color then I was
like I think that's necklace wants me to
be like basic like oh you gotta just
have you know a basic black and white
situation but I was like no because this
necklace doesn't define who we are
would you like rock this I'm like a
regular day or no you know when a kids
like to brawl see you and they're like
hey this is you and it's really bad but
you just have to be like oh no I feel
okay take me through this because this
is a thing I would actually wear good
I'm glad when I think of spring time I
think of yellow and initially I wanted
that yellow top behind you but I saw
that we had a mustard scarf and I'm like
okay I'm into that and then these are
like my favorite pants ever I have them
and I wear them all the time really long
time literally my favorite I were like
three times a week like way more than I
should wear and a denim jacket because
it's just a spring staple and you gotta
have the denim jacket I think you can
even wear it a little bit like off the
shoulder and like make it like you know
- in my IV one but we got to ask a few
more people with a things I will say
they are both great outfits okay get to
the get to the winner I would have to go
with this outfit I feel it's a little
more poppy with color we're going for a
spring right I feel like these are all
very dark it's gonna start getting a
little warm the sun's gonna start coming
out you might burn up a bit but this
shirt seems very breezy right the color
the necklace I got that necklace we
might doesn't match but pants it clashes
but it works and we have a beautiful
model duh can we just talk about yes all
this I don't know if I should say thank
you right now or if I should be a petal
you didn't pick my out yeah this would
be more of like coming into fall this is
more we're entering this room okay fair
enough okay I'm a casual kind of gal as
you can see I would wear the denim
jacket like this one just seems more
comfortable so if I'm going for comfort
and something that I would wear it would
be a mauls outfit okay so one for one I
would say we gotta be honest and this is
the one that's more wearable so it is
comfy and Athene sad who's the winner
okay between the two I like this outfit
more I really love how this like whole
outfit kind of like makes the necklace
pop this is really beautiful too but I'm
into how this like just highlights the
necklace thank you you're welcome
okay so we have a clear winner it's this
outfit but it's you pick this outfit so
we're both winners we are winner
we're bow and go with one come back any
time I will I'll be back
we have to do this again yes we do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
