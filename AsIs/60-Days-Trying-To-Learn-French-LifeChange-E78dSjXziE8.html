new language by using a language
learning app for 20 minutes a day for 60
days straight
I know zero French I'm sorry in advance
I'd say I probably know about 1% of the
French language
Albert voix we know hey dubby ma'am
it's there's words in French that
have letters that you don't pronounce
it's like English it's a disaster French
sounds like a very sexy language the
reason I want to learn French this way I
want to not watch French films with
subtitles they could be kind of nice
that I'll always have to read the
subtitles at the bottom I kind of hope
that this time around I learn it in a
very conversational way like the way you
learn a language as a baby it's such a
romantic and beautiful language I want
to be good at this just seems really
easy I was half right come on mix you
guess some oh I have to do all of these
today I said would I sign up for your 40
points away from being on track today 40
points yeah I could totally do this for
20 minutes a day I'll probably feel like
an idiot but hopefully by the end I'll
be speaking French I'm better at reading
it and like plugging it in and having my
handheld through it as opposed to
practically using it in real-life
situations I can read it but I can't
pronounce any of it I don't know I think
it'd be a lot easier if I knew somebody
who spoke French that I could talk to to
make sure I'm not just sounding like an
idiot so we brought in Annabelle who is
a native French speaker how long is like
spoken French I'm French for no native
great fabulous yes yes a little petite
Bonjour
como Ella
kamal surpass the cold of Jose let's say
something to me in French um gem Masha
everyone was a little nervous at first
but as a lesson went along they were
able to get more comfortable but is it a
fee or fee it what's the difference
between using - and vous that's slipping
hard we gave them a quiz halfway through
to see how much they actually learned
parlez-vous francais
we oh no no
what's cake again two out of three words
here I'm sure right what the is
that I am just making stuff up I don't
know well I got ha ha ha no this isn't
this is all right I mean it's basically
a pass or fail and I think we're failing
yep we're feeling based on the quiz it
was easy to see that they hadn't been
practicing every day and only remembered
basic words and phrases it's tough as an
adult with a life to learn in length
I'm overestimated how difficult this
would be so we brought back Annabel to
help them prep for the final dinner
party where they would interact with
other French speakers Buzzelli ode esto
mm-hmm deca just reverts for service
with an immersion with Arab wha it was
very poly awesome so you're the server
where the gasps yes that we're gonna
drink yeah and then we're gonna talk
about it it doesn't have to be the most
complicated conversation just try to
make us some casts ghost boo boo sadhya
progeny
this is really bad excuse moi je parle
pas Anglais
Oh No
pull it you pull a heavy on the one play
a key school a chicken egg will Monsieur
cos gosh Papa Sofia
what do you want biatch boom poem in
problem just an apple from try to make
four sentences case J will do poem 8 pun
how do you say this is gonna go
horrifically okay guys so the rule is
that we're gonna speak only friends
really I saw that the life right Sonic
okay Dex just sweet dis Alera
hey we even start okay I don't know how
to say dinner but it was Swabian felt
like a four year old around a bunch of
adults had no idea what the they were
talking about doom yeah I love it
Beckett I probably practice like twice a
week and most of it was like brushing up
on the stuff I learned the previous week
so I didn't get through a lot I feel
like if I practiced every day like if I
kept doing what I was doing in the
beginning I probably know like a lot of
French by now this I've learned more
tonight than I did ever doing it on the
app you need to be with people you need
to be in person the moral of the story
is that you should get a personal
teacher to teach you French really to
learn a language you gotta practice
French no joke it's it's hardest I'll
have a drunk suicide of what I'm saying
makes sense
