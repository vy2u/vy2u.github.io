days firefighters used to dip their
beards and water put them between their
teeth and breathe through the wet hair
when entering fires in ancient Egypt
fake metal beards called pastiche were
symbols of power authority worn only by
the most regal if beards make you
nervous you might have positive phobia
an abnormal unrelenting fear of beards
in the NHL players will often sport
playoff beards they stop shaving when
the team enters the Stanley Cup Playoffs
and don't shave again until their team
wins or is eliminated in 2011 Amish
communities in eastern Ohio were struck
by a strange series of attacks where the
Amish were forcibly feared and stripped
of their beards by other Amish people
beards are considered more attractive
when they're rare this is an example of
an evolutionary phenomenon that gives an
advantage to rare traits but in battle a
beard is great weakness because it can
be easily grabbed by enemies so warriors
with beards were thought to be even more
badass
