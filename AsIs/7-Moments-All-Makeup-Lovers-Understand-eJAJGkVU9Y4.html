controversial subject sometimes guys
love to talk about how they think makeup
is deceiving so you just assumed that I
had naturally purple eyelids and then
there are those who automatically link
girls who love makeup to having deep
rooted issues I've never seen her
without makeup I know does she even know
who she is aside from that there are a
few euphoric moments that only girls who
truly love makeup will understand like
when your cat eye is so sharp it could
kill a man
or when you realize your lip stain is
actually long wearing or spending so
much of makeup you get a free gift you
want a hundred paws on you just want
this amazing moisturizer oh my gosh now
most people wouldn't associate loving
makeup with speed and agility but the
moment you save your compact while it's
staring down death store is better than
any NFL interference I've ever seen and
there's no greater satisfaction than
waiting for the new palette to drop the
same way guys wait for the new Easy's
and actually getting your hands on it we
do and you know you love makeup when
your definition of a good day is
sneezing without ruining your
masterpiece and nothing screams
sisterhood like meeting someone who's
just as obsessed with makeup as you are
where do you get your eyeliner from it's
always on point oh thank you so much hey
I love the lip is that Kat Von D low yes
is that ruble yeah girl at the end of
the day makeup is more than just powders
and lipsticks it's about trying new
things trading secrets and looking and
feeling your best and it's just about
fun okay it's really fun so I spend so
much money on it I just want to have fun
I spent thousands of dollars on makeup
it's really Pleasant but it's really fun
no I don't want help stop it no did it
break
I want $30 oh wait I can't cry I can't
cry can't cry I like makeup</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
