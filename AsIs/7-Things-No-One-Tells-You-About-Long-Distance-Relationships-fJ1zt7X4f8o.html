it is currently 3:13 right now and it's
been exactly 54 days since I last saw my
girlfriend and today I get the jump on a
plane fly 2,000 miles and see here for
the weekend I only get to see her 6 or 7
times a year maybe less long-distance
relationships are made up a lot of a lot
of waiting it's almost like in these
relationships we put ourselves through a
heartbreak every time we go and see each
other because we know at the end of our
meeting together we're going to have to
go back to our respective
places and that sucks it honestly sucks
it sucks that I haven't seen my girl
burn 54 days it sucks that when I get
there I'm dreading the day that I have
to leave it sucks to know that I'm going
to be crying on the airplane flying back
to California it sucks that's the only
like real moments we can have together
are just sliver of time where we have to
condense everything that responsive
experience as a couple into three days I
just got to the airport leave a key for
me right now and the hardest thing is
try not to think about when it's over
one thing I do hate is flying I don't
know I just don't like her being in a
small room with a lot of people in a
moving vehicle
oh gosh so cold let's go find me but
seeing her for the first time in 54 days
reminds me of why it's all worth it hi
wait do media coder look at how many
cars are behind us oh my gosh hi hi okay
stop and we really do cherish the
moments more so than any other couple
that I know over I'm tired I just flew
across the freakin country like the
moments we get to celebrate all of our
missed anniversaries sighs I don't thank
you young you're welcome in the moment
our relationship picks up right where it
left off a beautiful day out with a
beautiful lady and then there are those
moments that we get to explore the city
just like we used to
where are we off to it's called North
Market
not to mention make up for all the meals
that we miss eating together all right
we got a food
I got fall she got Indian food and
eventually we just start to settle back
slowly to what used to be those moments
where we just watch TV hung out with old
friends shared inside jokes and just
walked around enjoying each other's
company all those moments that make
long-distance worth it but then of
course life doesn't stop for us you know
yo yo yo yo yo my selfie yeah what are
you doing
ah struggles so we've come to the time
where we're going to start planning the
next trip where we get to see each other
this is the time where we just kind of
ease back into the real world I guess in
the end what we learned is that long
distance is really really tough but
sometimes I do feel like it's a struggle
that we were meant to go through to make
it stronger because I mean if we can get
through this that we can get through
anything right we just have to trust
each other and love each other and give
each other our all call me naive but I
think it can work it never ever ever
gets easier I told myself this time I
wasn't gonna cry
I remember the first time I dropped
being off of the airport after she
visited me I cried so hard that I was
blind driving home it was the most
dangerous drive I've ever done and then
I cried a time after that and have that
and now it's the fifth time just never
gets easier no ah gotta go back to
reality and the sniffles are coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
