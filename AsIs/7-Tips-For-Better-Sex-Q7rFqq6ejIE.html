these are seven ways to have better sex
develop a better relationship with your
body so many of us struggle with
negative body image but it's really hard
to have a hot sex life if you're
constantly criticizing your own body
focus on the pleasure forget about the
cellulite let go of shame whether it
comes from our parents our culture our
gender our religion we all have hang-ups
about sex you may not be able to let go
of every single negative message you've
ever heard but just knowing that sex is
normal natural and beautiful it can go
such a long way get better at
communicating sex is hard to talk about
I wouldn't have a job if it wasn't this
practice asking for what you want asking
your partner what they want and giving
feedback be a respectful and generous
partner and expect the same in return
whether you're having casual sex or in a
committed relationship we could all
stand to be better partners to each
other always be experimenting it's fine
to like what you like but try to seek
out new experiences on a regular basis
just to shake things up slow down we're
all so busy these days that we treat sex
like another item to cross off our to-do
lists if you want to have a great sex
life you have to make time in your life
for sex and actually savor the
experiences that you do have have fun
most people take sex way too seriously
it's perfectly fine to laugh during sex
it's okay to joke around it's okay to be
silly and playful sex isn't meant to be
enjoyed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
