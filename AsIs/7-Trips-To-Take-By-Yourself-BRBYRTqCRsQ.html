alone to meet new people from different
parts of the world or to spend time with
just your thoughts a lot of people who
might like to take a trip are
intimidated by the idea either afraid of
being lonely or afraid for their safety
but every day around the world travelers
just like you are exploring places by
themselves these are some trips you can
take solo you can hostel hop for a few
weeks around Europe there will be other
solo travelers in the hostel who can be
your short-term friends you can explore
the city with them or you can just drink
in cafes on old cobblestone streets and
not check your phone once cuz you don't
even have service abroad you can take a
train someplace new the train journey
itself can make for a thoughtful solo
trip it's comfortable and reflective and
even if you don't speak to anyone you
have the view to keep you company go to
a smaller city where you might have just
one friend whose couch you can crash on
when they're at work or school you
should just wander the city and talk to
people ask them what it's like to live
that they'll be friendly and surprised
you came to their town just to explore
go spend some time in a beach town zone
out to the sounds of the waves by
yourself because not every trip needs to
be about partying it can just be about
going someplace beautiful and then being
go to New York City by yourself and sure
New York can be a really fun place to
visit with friends but if you're only by
yourself you don't get caught up in
anyone else's plans where are we eating
where are we drinking who are we meeting
up with New York City is one of the most
interesting places to visit in the world
you don't need anybody to have a great
time there go to a part of Asia where
you don't speak the language or
understand the culture it's like giving
yourself volunteer culture shop visiting
an alternate reality traveling alone is
about breaking out of your comforts and
what better place to do that then a
country that is completely foreign
go on here someplace for a while
sometimes you want to take a trip by
yourself but you don't want to be alone
well volunteering can be a great way to
meet people and it can be reminder that
it's not just about you so leave
everything behind and be by yourself
just pack a bag and a camera get lost
so where you go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
