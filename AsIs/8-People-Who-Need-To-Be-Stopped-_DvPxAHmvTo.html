a.m. on a Saturday morning sure I could
do it at any other time but hey early
bird gets the worm I'm the guy who rides
his brakes for no apparent reason I've
got nowhere to go today so I hope you
don't mind a little traffic I'm the guy
who just uses the restroom right before
you sure I could have aimed right for
the toilet but how much more fun would
it be if I just peed all over the ground
hey don't slip I'm the guy who likes to
make controversial facebook statuses
you're gonna comment on them and then
I'm gonna tell you that you're wrong I'm
the guy in front of you at the ATM I'm
gonna stand here for 15 minutes pushing
random buttons because I don't know how
this thing works I'm the guy who spoils
movies for you remember the time I told
you that Bruce Willis was actually dead
at the end of six cents dude I told you
I have to see it that movies been out
for like 20 years you should have seen
it by now I'm the guy that's gonna put
his shopping cart right in your next
parking spot sure I could take the
shopping cart carousel but I just don't
want to and worst of all I'm the guy who
makes popcorn in the office
you smell that everyone that's my
popcorn and this is the last popcorn</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
