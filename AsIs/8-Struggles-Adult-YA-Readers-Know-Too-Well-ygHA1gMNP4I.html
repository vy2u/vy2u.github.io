simplistic but it's a Jesus parable with
a female protagonist you can't deny

Jacob was so hot he was so hot right and
it sparked an argument between social
classes Team Edward Team Jacob Hey yeah

buying this for my niece also Oh
late night yeah tell me everything
well I finished book five of Vampire
Diaries and done I finished that in two
days to make sure he was still in
control of his I don't know why parents
let their kids read this garbage well at
least they're reading I guess
it's a pretty good movie maybe I should
read the book now you haven't read the
book oh my god first of all that old man
doesn't even exist yet well I think it's
good for girls to read this it's
actually a deconstructed Cinderella
story set in the plague addled world of
new Beijing according to my niece my
niece has really good taste well this
one's not setting you Beijing it's set
in France and I'm not even sure if
cinders in it is it Little Red Riding
Hood I think so
