dance recital that's a good thing
I love highlighters you like it I love
them I'm a recent tie lighter I like
that little puff it gives you I need to
be a light bulb throughout the day my
everyday highlighter is like a la creme
do shared and sweat know the girl that
replaced your home makeup routine the
pie later I love I mean there's a
difference between dewy and like looking
like you submerged yourself and like a
pot of hot gold I love that I'm um
skeptical that price actually mattered I
just thought if you get your stuff at
like a nice makeup store chances are
it's gonna like feel and last a lot
longer
all right we're gonna start with the $8
colour pop I love color pops lipsticks
ooh right soft really soft that's real
 oh I like this it looks good it's
subtle whoo oh it's getting very sparkly
if I look sorry I'm worried though my
nose is so happy to be here today
like I'm present I'm highlighted I'm
accounted for it looks kind of bad yours
looks good it's not a brick I'm not
gonna lie your line water girls we gotta
be honest with each other this is pretty
legit if you ask me I wouldn't want
anything more from a highlight obviously
I'm not like jumping up and down for it
but I think it looks pretty good I think
you just need to find the right shade
and it actually could probably work out
and eight dollars
you know how like benefit is know for
brows that goes known for highlight
every beauty blogger has like a Becca
highlighter
what's Becca's deal you know who is
Becca oh this is golden
yeah it's a lot stronger than the last
one
my kids holy statue oh
you're looking statuesque as food my god
is my Greek heritage coming out this is
a shimmer highlight compared to like
color pop right here which is glittery
highlight this is like some adult
you're paying for a more intense look
for $38 I don't know I think this was a
very special occasion situation here's
the thing if you want a more pigmented
highlighter it's worth of money for you
but there's also not too much in here so
30 bucks is a lot
this looks like a birth control that is
one fancy birth control pack you
can apparently put it all over your face
to correct and illuminate and there's
five pearls in it handcrafted visually
it looks awesome and I'm hopeful that it
can do what it says which is apparently
work on every single skin type it's a
huge mission statement super translucent
no no I look the same this is a trick
this is a trick this is like paying $180
to see Casper no that's Ruta so now I'm
getting plated on your head nothing
happens they're like women love pearls
crush them up and put them in a compact
makes 100 bucks I feel like they sell
this on QVC to my grandma and my grandma
buys it for me for Christmas and I was
like oh you need this it's gonna do this
it has pearls in it and I'm like grandma
this is at $180 it smells like
roses it's not okay yeah but fragrance
on your skin is bad anyway yeah he's
close
overall the highlight / illuminator /
pearl
/ color corrector was not worth it I'm
paying $180 like I've ever get like a
facelift
we spent $100 to look exactly the
 same
color pop pop pop it's just so
affordable I like how it feels
I like how she Marie it is for $8 boom
I equivalent everything that I buy and
make up to how many meals that I could
get out of it essentially I would only
be giving up one meal for this
I mean honestly is it a letter just
eyeshadow I honestly feel like you don't
need to spend a shitload of money to
look good if I want to look like a dewy
ass bitch I'm gonna spend $8 on it
because sweat is free okay
just remember that at the end of the day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
