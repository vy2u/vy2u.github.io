think that you're jealous of them that's
what's special about some girls are dumb
boy and that's what's special about some
boys they like girl things America's a
land the free you can like what you want
my mom definitely taught me that two
wrongs don't make a right
every summer vacation you grow a little
bit you figure something out that you
like more and it kind of just makes you
more mature and you can't tell mama like
you're gonna find out mom always finds
out
both days Christmas and Hanukkah is like
not about the present it's about
spending time with your family some more
minutes or girls when they like them
that's not the way they get them to like
you back you have to show respect of
kindness you have to stand up and fight
for your right never trade anyone or
anything just for money and take care of
your family here you can believe in what
you want you know the king and doesn't
make up the rules for you and that's
what makes America special that's what
makes this country special</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
