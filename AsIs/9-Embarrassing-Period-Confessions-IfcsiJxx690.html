I dropped my bloody tampon and it rolled
into the next stall I heard a loud
scream and then I realized I was in the
men's bathroom one time I got my period
in class so to cover it up I told
everyone that I killed my sister's
ferret I once lied to a guy and told him
he was my first because I started my
period while we were having sex
one time when I was on my period I saw a
picture of a burrito and started crying
because it was pretty once I got my
period during gymnastics class everyone
saw the stains when I did a cartwheel
one time I got my period as I was taking
a urine drug test I had to hand a bloody
cup of pee to the woman once on my
period I dropped a ball of ice cream on
the floor and I sat down next to it and
cried for an hour one time I got my
period all over my chair so my best
friend Porter cranberry juice all over
me to cover it up once while I was
upside down on a roller coaster I got my
period and they went up my back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
