so before I confronted her I suggested
we finally get couples tattoos of each
other's names I had her go first while I
snuck out and I went home I found out my
ex was cheating on me so I spoiled the
last season of The Walking Dead my
girlfriend cheated on me so I
accidentally bleached all of her
favorite shirts before I confronted my
ex that I had discovered he was cheating
I cooked Mexican for dinner and then hid
all the toilet paper my ex cheated on me
with our neighbor so I got back by
sending nudes of him to his family from
his phone when my ex cheated on me I
decided to get revenge by deleting all
the memory on his ps3 I've never seen
him so mad my girlfriend cheated on me
so I peed in her shampoo bottles my
boyfriend cheated on me so I wrote on
all his Jordans with sharpie right
before Christmas I discovered my
ex-girlfriend had been cheating on me my
sister had a great suggestion
I screenshotted the conversation she was
having with her side dude rented them
out and gave them to her as a present</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
