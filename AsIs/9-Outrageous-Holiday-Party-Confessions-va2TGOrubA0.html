party I'm the boss and I've been seeing
another employee from work on Friday I
lost my virginity to a work colleague at
our Christmas party and have to face him
and everyone else tomorrow once at a
Christmas party I got so drunk I
apparently pretended I was a unicorn and
climbed the Christmas tree
my boss handed me my Christmas present
right when I walked into the annual
office holiday party it was a pot
brownie been secretly dating a guy from
work for a while I thought he'd surprise
me by asking me to the Christmas party
the only surprise I got was he was
taking his wife just had a work
Christmas party and almost kissed the
hottest girl in the office I'm married I
made out with my husband's boss at the
holiday party I got so drunk at our
office Christmas party I don't remember
telling my boss about the sexual
harassment I've been too scared to
report thanks drunk me last night i
twerked on the vp of my company at the
office Christmas party I would normally
be embarrassed but he was working right
