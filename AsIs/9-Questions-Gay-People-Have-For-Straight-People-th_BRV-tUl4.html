you call it a lifestyle like choosing to
wear a dress he lives by the beach
that's his lifestyle it's not really a
lifestyle it's just my life why is it
that when you find out that I'm gay you
think that I want you standards first of
all everyone has a type you might not be
their type don't flatter yourself
why are you so worried about how I'm
gonna have kids why does it matter if
I'm gonna have kids or not technically
the world is overpopulated and me not
reproducing is helping you out so if I
wanna have kids I'm pretty sure I can
figure it out why do you feel the need
to ask who's the man and who's the woman
in the relationship last I checked we
were both women it's why we're together
both have lady parts why do you get
offended when people ask if you're a gay
why would you be offended that someone
thinks you're gay I don't get offended
when people think I'm straight I mean I
kind of do there are worse things how
does it feel to be accurately
represented in everything every single
show and film ever
why is your definition of diversity a
gay white man I can't think of anyone
who reminds me of me the most that I had
was Buffy and she was straight the other
most probably the closest representation
of a young gay Asian why is it that you
have such a large dating pool but still
a really high divorce rate hmm because
it's it's real marriage because it's
heterosexual why do you have to call it
a gay weddings just a wedding it's just
a wedding if it just so you can charge
us more if two black people were getting
married would you call it a black
wedding why do you try to set us up with
the very next gay person you see I don't
try to set you up with the other
straight guy I know we have tinder or
Grindr but what what do you ladies use
oh we don't have one okay never mind
thank you for trying to set us up we
need help you have to take into account
the percentage of women that are
interested in women and then those
percentage of women who I'm attracted to
and then those percentage of women
were attracted to me and then those
percentage of women that you know I am I
have chemistry with and that our
personalities line up and that's like
three women robbed me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
