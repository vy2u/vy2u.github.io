that's not a fashion accessory it's a
ceremonial item you do realize Coachella
is not considered a Vision Quest a
headdress goes really well with your
privilege why do you always ask me how
native I am why should I have to prove
myself to you it's so weird to have
someone immediately want to quantify my
identity that's just as personal as
asking me my birthday my weight or my
bra size why do you tell me I don't look
like a Native American does the Native
American look like did I put some war
paint on should I make my hair longer oh
sorry I didn't know that white people
were the authority on what Native
Americans look like why do you think we
get everything for free I don't get
casino money I do pay taxes and I have
student loans up to here and while we're
at it natives are one of the poorest
demographics in the country if somebody
wants to pay for my student loans at any
time please send me a check what's up
with the Washington are words just
change the name yeah you don't find it
offensive because it has nothing to do
with you look I get that the R word is a
tradition to the football team but we
also have a tradition not being racist
why do you think that real Indians all
live on reservations I do pay for
reserved parking in my rent it's
actually less than 50% of natives that
live on reservations so what's it like
seeing yourself accurately portrayed in
the media in every single movie and TV
show and news outlet what's that like I
would love to know on top of it we've
got a lot of white people who are
playing native characters Rooney Mara
I'm talking to you why do you think we
all know each other we're not actually
like that movie avatar we don't have a
spiritual high of mind connected through
the trees there are more than five
million Native Americans in America do
all white people know each other what
you guys don't do you
how you enjoying our land it's pretty
nice right I would love some of that
land - anything else I can get you cold
beverage you're welcome
I mean we used to have like prime real
estate but uh now we got like little
real estate I had something happening</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
