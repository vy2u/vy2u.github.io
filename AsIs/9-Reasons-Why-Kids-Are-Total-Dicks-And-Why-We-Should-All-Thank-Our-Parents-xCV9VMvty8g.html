parents know the truth
kids are total dicks babies may seem
cute but they're actually the worst they
little pouches they cry constantly they
can't even walk or talk for a whole year
it's like playing the most boring game
of charades except you're never gonna
win okay three words first word think
you can be a parent one baby can burn
through 5,000 diapers in under three
years guess who gets to clean that up
that's $1,200 and 166 hours spent on
baby poo with that time and money you
can master archery you like sleep and
don't have a kid first two years
parents can expect to lose 730 hours of
sleep that's 30 days of your life you're
never ever gonna get back you're gonna
look like and you're gonna feel like but
anything for love right obviously you
can't put a price tag on love but let's
say you had to by the time your kid is
18 you'll spend an estimated two hundred
and forty thousand dollars do you buy
with that money a boat probably maybe a
couple boats I don't know and that's
before college tuition and guess what
College is just the beginning
59% of adults age 18 to 39 are still
financially dependent on their parents
in some capacity all that little Johnny
couldn't be bothered by damn flowers for
your damn birthday what a dick so kids
be grateful to your parents it's a
miracle they put up with your for
this long and parents you're amazing
thank you
you seriously don't deserve it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
