food more than anything else.
Few things make me so happy.
All I need to get out
of bed is the knowledge
there's a delicious
breakfast waiting for me.
The Daily Struggles Of A Hungry Girl
Who needs coffee? Pancakes
and bacon act as adrenaline.
And by the time breakfast is over,
I'm already thinking about lunch.
Then, there's working out.
Do I do it for myself?
Sort of. Well, not really.
I do it for the doughnuts
I know I'll be eating at work today.
Damn you, doughnut day.
I know I shouldn't stop by Starbucks,
but I haven't had one
since, well, yesterday.
But whatever, I worked
out today so it's fine.
I kind of want a Clif Bar,
that's healthy, right?
But no, no, as you just ate.
Although, if I don't get it now,
it'll be gone, and that
will be a disaster.
I'll just get one for later.
- Oh, you take it.
- Are you sure?
- [Voiceover] You move one
inch closer to that Clif Bar,
and I will destroy all that is
near and dear to your heart.
- Yup, it's yours.
- Thanks.
- [Voiceover] Whatever, it's
only 10 minutes til lunch,
I can make it until then.
Fancy Friday Party.
This seems kind of lame.
Wait, free dinner! Yes!
- Hey Liz, can we do that
meeting now instead of 2 o'clock?
- [Liz] Does he have any
idea what time it is?
Does he not realize that
some of us need to eat lunch
and anytime other than right now
would have been infinitely better?
- Sure.
- [Coworker] Awesome,
great, thank you so much.
- [Liz] Finally that meeting's over.
Time for the best part of the day.
Oh my god, this burger looks so good.
- Think he's cheating on me?
- Yeah totally.
- Liz, you think he's cheating on me?
- Oh what, no!
- [Liz] She gonna finish those fries?
Do I ask or wait for
her to offer them to me?
Wait no, he can't take these
there's still more left!
- Wait, you're done right?
- Yeah, you can have them
if you want. Yeah I'm done.
- Okay. Do you mind if I
keep these just for a minute?
Sorry, just don't wanna waste them.
- [Liz] I'm so stuffed,
I must be three months
pregnant with my food child.
I am never eating again.
Doughnuts. Damn you, doughnut day.
