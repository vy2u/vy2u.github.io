with an umbrella the assumption is that
they're either from California or just a
work you just like you put the hood on
your rain jacket off you scrunch up your
face and you just try to range
we didn't have swimming pools weird
swimming holes there'd be a rock and
there'd be some water there might be a
little waterfall you jump off the rock
into the cold ice water and that's where
you swim
we don't have pool it's one chlorine
you're gonna have fresh water and the
possibility to cut your leg on a broken
Coors Light can I just feel like we were
beer snobs before everyone with beer
songs and now that everyone's a beer
snobs we're just kind of over you see
kids now who just like oh I only drink
IPAs that come from the East Coast and
you think man that's what I was like
it's 17 you're 30 year old dude just
wrong with you
most guy books you go to Portland you
like you have to try blue your dad's you
get to do two Donuts there's a 30-minute
line spoiler it's a donut with Lucky
Charms on it it's not great it's
it's a fine doughnut if you don't have
to wait in line for it but who keeps
donuts anyway Portland you didn't just
get hot it's just always been like a
nice quiet decent sized city to live in
it's like not news to anyone
it's from Oregon we always like
Portland's most are going in say Seattle
with quotation marks Seattle nothing
real I like a Washington now get me
wrong but yeah Seattle like useless
that's is what we grew up with we're
used to to seeing a dude with dreadlocks
selling his joke book in front of the
bookstore not impressed by the fact that
you read one book by Deepak Chopra and
now you're an expert in alternative
spirituality well turning spirituality
was taught to kindergartners in Oregon
it's not a thing there's a lot of dream
catchers and or
I feel like gorgonians probably catch
more dreams per capita than anybody else
this side of like a Native American
reservation hazelnuts are cookin filbert
good program I called him filbert if
people are like what's a filbert I got
to college as like you know like it that
little like this looks like a testicle
like in I don't know if there's any sort
of governing body that rank States per
capita or just per volume punched poetry
but if there was Oregon would be number
one garner the high school closer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
