you'll inexplicably need to pee every 20
minutes if you sit on the aisle you will
constantly have people climbing over you
and don't forget the middle seat
it's just the worst you don't pay any
attention to the safety demonstration
but then wish you had as soon as
turbulence hits the flight attendant
will tell you to turn off your phone
ma'am can I get you to turn your phone
off we're preparing for takeoff now but
the plane will then sit at the gate for
another half an hour
you finally get settled only to realize
your headphones and book or in the
overhead bins time to read that exciting
in-flight magazine you daydream about
your destination and it is glorious
until a baby starts crying loudly
probably right behind you even though
you hate peanuts you can't seem to stop
eating them you know is that you strike
up a conversation with the person next
to you and it turns out they have a
fascinating life that means I travel
around the world I taste us different
wines I rate them while on the other
side of you someone is snoring loudly I
think
chillie you are super excited for the
free drink but you've fallen asleep by
the time the flight attendant actually
gets to you but sometimes it's all worth
it when you're sat next to someone to
crush on
