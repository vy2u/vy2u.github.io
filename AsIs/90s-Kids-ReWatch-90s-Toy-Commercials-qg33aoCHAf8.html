blonde children having fun with
eccentric goodies I was born in the 80s
which is what makes a true 90's kid
you don't remember 92 93 94 but I was
there
these are the animals made out of couch
oh and Stephanie tanner yes I'll do your
show but my dressing room has to have
nothing but bouche what are you doing
the greenroom right now oh I'm just here
playing with my cush Ling's they're
called couch things yeah Jody they're
cool
that's all people ever had to say back
that was just like oh yeah it's cool hey
what do you want from a high-powered
blaster oh no I just starts with the
kids screwing balls more balls you know
this kid got through the killed all
through high school for being the more
balls could you say Oh who's allowing
these kids to play this abandoned
warehouse I don't care how many balls
you have don't let your kids play in
warehouses he's so scary
before you look like an innocent little
kid I don't believe that it works this
hose goes down it's not gonna suck the
balls through the hose it looked like a
flaccid penis hey what do you want from
a high-powered blaster Oh
in class a penis that's cool all they
tell you when you buy a like a super
soaker is don't spray people in the face
and that's all they did that whole
commercial spray nail in the face it
looks really cool like this is something
I would a hundred percent have been into
what is this I piece for the product
looked cool I understood what it did I
understood why you would want it because
yes sneaky way would I maybe want that
like today
all 90s commercials made me feel like my
friends weren't cool enough five mini I
also remember being frustrated at how
unrealistic 90s commercials were I
watched a lot of TV and my Christmas
lists were long that like pinkish purple
with that neon green that's it that's
the 90s it's just so sad what's
happening over there oh yeah you don't
know the half</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
