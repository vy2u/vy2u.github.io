about cat dog perhaps it's not just a
physical connection but an emotional one
as well but how do they poop all right
let's see what what's going on with old
Doug funnie
do you do dad wants patty who wouldn't
she's a dream it was anyone's convinced
that scooter was black so think I
remember - Doug had this like all furry
goes like a superhero in his head
well me Roger is such a dick right just
laughs it's amazing
there's blue people and green people
they're all like journal entries I love
Rugrats don't squirt the milk all over
your parents Tommy no you know were the
best Rugrats characters filling lil
hands down feel like I was like a little
bit Tommy a little bit of Chucky I was
afraid of some things but I was I was a
leader oh my god you're my favorite
Rugrats episode is you just hit me
Reptar on ice yeah I don't remember
their voices being so annoying what's
the dinosaur to do when there's kids on
the ice made these babies do adult
things weird because I don't really
remember the Rugrats in my mind as
babies it's actually probably has the
best writing of any cartoon anything
that's like slightly dark and weird I
was I love stuff so crooks
Slover is kind of a really strong Jewish
caricature funny that they call the cow
heifer heifer is like a lady cow right
hi if so marsupial automatically equals
Australian Rocco and his dog look a lot
alike you always like this
it's also weird that animals have
animals as pets own is Balzac hey
they're in a town called ballsack
interspecies Siamese twins that dumb
hello one in the world a little cat
though it's a lot more to ask me to
believe an animal like this can survive
did a cat have sex with a dog like dog
just spit out a hairball and they never
addressed the whole bowel movement thing
they're constantly reminding you all
remember they're different why is their
mouse from New York Winslow you are a
houseguest they live in a fishbone how
because that's what each one likes their
physical comedy is great is he a day are
they he's but I drowned well your voice
is for weirder than I remember it was
like one person is doing an impression
of cat dog not how I remember cat dog
nineties Nick were just as awesome as I
remember them I will watch any and every
cartoon I won't watch this whole thing
I'm gonna have to what findings online
when I get home also how does cat dog
food</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
