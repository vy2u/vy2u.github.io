here with Tyler Tyler how you doing very
good you ready to play this game sure

which one of these lovely ladies is
Sofia what would be the optimal choice
for you to end on for Sofia out of
marrying kill I'm gonna be forward with
it I'm gonna go on a limb and say marry
yeah hey okay great well we ready to
start playing the game let's do it I'm
gonna be choosing my girlfriend out of a
lineup I think I can choose her for at
least but also Mary as well I'm gonna
marry her I probably I may be who knows
yeah no promises I want to make him
think that I'm answering as Sofia so
that he marries me in kill Sofia Tyler
is very good-looking smart and funny but
he's very bad at Busbee game shows so my
expectations are well-known Tyler a
little while now good friends Lata I'm a
nice person you better not kill me I
know where they live go ahead and take a
look at the question again I then ask
everybody out there to answer it I love
a good adventure on the high seas what
would you do to rock my boat let's start
with lady number one I would get a
Groupon and we would go kayaking in San
Diego oh okay seem like you love that
answer great Oh San Diego right okay
good what else to say all right lady
number two hey what am I started an
athlete and go through this female
trainers poet and say the try to surf
away I've attached before let's hear now
from lady number three I would buy him
the entire box set of games bronze
and you would just curl up in bed and
then afterwards just well you done who
doesn't like that Wow right that sounds
pretty good which one of those three do
you think right now your most wanting to
work well I'd say the one that wanted to
go to the South China Sea was kind of
out there okay I'm not saying I think
that that is Sofia but it was an
interesting proposal all right let's
move on which lady would you like to ask
a question to what was the order in
which they answered last one two and
three
okay ah - death is inevitable how do you
think you'll die not a lot of big
indicators don't want to die young not a
lot of people in that mode right you
know we can have a little Lana Del Rey
boat as we write to say right that's
what we all say it I like it quick
quickly and suddenly next question lady
one or three one okay family is very
important to me and it is if you could
only save your mom grandma or sister who
would you choose I would choose to save
my mom because I feel like she has a lot
more wisdom to impart I think my grandma
has already had her time and whoa great
answer terribly presented yeah grandma's
don't watch a lot of YouTube right right
so there you go all right so we only
have one question left then for lady
number three I am a huge book nerd
what's one book that you claim you read
but you've been lying about this whole
time I rarely lie about book reading but
maybe the first Harry Potter event like
the first half and I tell people I read
the whole thing what you only read the
first half of Harry Potter that's like
the third grade version of me but I was
just like I couldn't read at that level
and there's a thick book and so I only
ran a little bit of it so did you end up
reading the rest of the Harry Potters or
did you just watch the movies than lie
about it's a real question it's actually
important do you want to die
okay the contestants have sort of rally
against our Tyler here so we're going to
move on to the final round we have one
last question you're gonna ask everybody
alright guys are simple but like to be
swooned tell me a rhyming couplet but
how great I am
let's put the pressure on lady number
three and work our way back to one this
time remember this is the one that
threatened to kill you moments ago yeah
no agree okay Tyler Tyler you are saved

things going on with Drake let's have
number to attempt a rhyming couplet for
Tyler I died like help me pretty good
