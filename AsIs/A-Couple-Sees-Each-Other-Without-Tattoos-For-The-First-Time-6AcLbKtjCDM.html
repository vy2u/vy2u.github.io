forever I got all of my tattoos covered
this is gonna be the first time that I
will see myself in over 20 years with
just my skin
hi I'm Vanessa I'm a preschool teacher
and I have been getting tattooed since I
was 18
hi my name is briar and I have been
getting tattoos for about twenty years
now
we met at a local bar he kind of just
sat and talked the whole time one of the
first things I noticed about him where
his tattoos and I loved them I
definitely think it's going to be
emotional tattoos have so many stories
behind them and hold so much meaning
that to just not have those is kind of
just like erasing a huge part of who we
are all right so let's get these tattoos
taken off yeah man let's do this I'm
excited I am a makeup artist with
dermablend you're primarily going to be
using the quickfix body stick and our
new formulated legged body and of course
our infamous setting powder to lock you
in and give you a little teaser whoa so
we're gonna separate you and you won't
see each other until the big reveal we
have two artists so we'll be working on
you guys separately so that you don't
see each other before the reveal all
right
ten years ago I would have said no no I
can't show these as a preschool teacher
I've kind of held back I started off
with ones that I could just kind of hide
behind sleeves then I kind of just
started going for it I've just kind of
got to a place where I want to be in the
school that's accepting of differences
when I walked into getting my first
tattoo 20 years ago it was definitely a
different stigma than walking into the
shop all the Jews were kind of
scary-looking and I'm like this little
small kid looking dude and now it's on
TV there's tattoo reality shows just a
normal thing now it's so acceptable I
can walk down the street with short
sleeves in a v-neck but maybe 15 years
ago he was still kind of like I had to
cover them up
so it feels like I've been standing here
forever I guess about a narrative and 45
minutes I'm kind of excited but scared
only because it's like young me and now
this is who I've become in who I am and
it's very much a part of me good to know
I'm looking at you you don't look like a
completely new person no it's like
there's something missing yeah yeah this
was a crazy experience it was a chance
to kind of see myself pure again you
know I haven't seen myself like this
since I was 18 so it's bizarre every
time I get a tattoo I will look at that
piece of skin and I'll admire it for a
good couple minutes and say to myself
that's the last time I'm gonna see that
skin with nothing on it so this is
incredible to have that chance to see it
again I definitely still prefer him with
tattoos the moment I saw her I fell in
love with her if she kept getting more
and more tattoos that's where she is so
this is fun
but give us some remover</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
