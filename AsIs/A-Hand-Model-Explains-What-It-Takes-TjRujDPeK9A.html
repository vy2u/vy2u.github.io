living doing hand jobs get your mind out
of the gutter on my hand model you need
to be born with good looking hands
that's pretty much the standard in the
baseline nice long straight fingers sort
of a gentle curve to the nail lack of
visible cuticles you don't want knuckles
that protrude no hairy hands although
there have been hand models that are
specifically hired because they have
hairy hands you need to be able to have
really steady hands like your cans can't
sort of shake perfect tiny motions over
and over if they want your hand in the
shot well my head might be in the way
and they don't really want that so kind
of have to be a contortionist and be
able to stay in really crazy positions
for long periods of time so my skincare
routine is pretty intense
I am constantly thinking hands first
so I moisturize gosh maybe 20 30 times a
day it's constant moisturizing I have
stuff in my bag I have it on my desk I
have it in my car just always grab a
little and constantly throwing it on and
then I use natural soaps
I wear gloves a lot of the time you have
to because if you get Sun or if you get
a slight little scratch or an
imperfection
that can cost you a job so you really
have to think about hands first it's a
very interesting career the best part is
that I get to be the model who enjoys
craft service because while everybody
else is worrying about whether they're
going to fit into that dress and how
their silhouettes gonna look I know my
hands look great when I'm a size eight
so if I go below a size eight my fingers
start to get a little bony and they just
start to look more knuckle II and the
reason I get picked is because my hands
don't look bony so therefore I get to be
the hands on top of all these amazing
gorgeous spaces and all of that and
holding the beauty products but that's
because I also get to enjoy craft
service how many times can I say hands
off can jump and jump and jump and jump
and jump</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
