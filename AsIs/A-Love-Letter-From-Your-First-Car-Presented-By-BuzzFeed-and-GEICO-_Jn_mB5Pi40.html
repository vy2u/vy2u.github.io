was I out
hey so you forgot about your old car who
you kiddin nobody forgets their first
car pretty sure that was doing something
so furious Wow
you sister sure did grow up bro I met
when she was in car seats I could
breathe yeah you're supposed to do you
remember the old trick think of all the
things we did together we had some fun
didn't we I can remember a time when I
was washed and waxed every Sunday but
then you came along quite the artiste I
have to admit you had style
thanks for the facelift we finally got
to park and a student lot no more
waiting on a curb for mom's minivan
this was the beginning of our
independence uh yeah I'm sorry about
strolling out take it easy I'll get it
it actually happens to a lot of cars
your first date went pretty well
huh that haircut wasn't your best look
and that shirt wasn't doing you any
favors but I got us to and from the
movies and I smelled really good thanks
she dates perfume wait a second there's
been this song in my head like all day
and I wanted to share it with someone so
I thought yeah do you want to listen to
me don't forget to jiggle those wires
remember the time senior year we were
looking for that secret food truck we
circled the same block 20 times you're
lucky I didn't blow a gasket you imagine
if I blew a gasket
what's a gas could do anyway that no
eating in the car rule it was good while
it lasted your friends were respectful
at first but before we knew it it was a
full-blown buffet my backseat I didn't
care but the floor mats they still
haven't forgiven you remember the open
road that feeling that as long as it was
guessing a tank and a map in a glove box
anything was possible on any given
Saturday afternoon you could discover a
new world
or you could stand by the side of the
road with your keys locked inside me a
knucklehead
thank you automotive guides for roadside
assistance am i right
we've come a long way since the old days
kid I knew this day would come but
here's the thing I'm not ready for this
does it have to be your sister all right
hand him over hold on a second okay what
made you think I'd be okay with change I
mean she's great and all but maybe she
can start with a bicycle okay fine I
guess this is happening now well here
goes nothing you're driving now make
sure your sister uses the no food to car
policy for at least a month okay thanks
for the memories kid your first car oh
no don't touch that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
