Pakistan when it started amongst the
people who watch American shows it had
an audience in Pakistan which it pissed
off immensely with this season do you
think that you're gonna mix in the crowd
by covering your head what about your
suits you're wearing
seriously so you can wear pants and a
shirt and nobody's gonna notice because
you've got your head covered I mean
Hillary Clinton comes in and she never
comes her head all the people who work
at the US aid in the State Department
who roam around and who go to cafes and
eat around and dine around and party and
have a good time in Pakistan they don't
cover the head isn't this the same guy
from Life of Pi he's a nephew of Husain
Haqqani is that what he just said he's a
nephew of Husain Haqqani they've
actually used the name of our ambassador
to the US as the name of the terrorist
oh oh wow if anybody has seen homeland
and for them the big terrorist guy think
of trying to get to is Husain Haqqani if
I went to meet the ambassador they think
oh the terrorists from homeland they
could not find any name a month like
hundreds of millions of name and that
you had to use so sign her Carney's name
for this it's like trying to show a
white supremacist racist in Pakistan and
calling him Bill Clinton or George Bush
so whenever you think of the American
president you think of a racist white
man at least got the flag right Pakistan
flood Americans have more security in
Pakistan than an average Pakistani it's
a bomb-proof car by the way they
traveled in it you can't just break and
shatter a glass right and and this adds
into this whole security paranoia of
America
it's not about gimmick on which would
mean houses of Islam bah not a
guesthouse a guesthouse would be a Sara
or just a guesthouse I mean did they use
Google Translate for this by the way
quite a few Pakistani origin Americans
are teaching in universities and Ivy
League universities in America who know
who they could have referred to as LA
was not even desi populated as the show
in this area the streets are not like
that the people don't even just like
that the people don't even look like
that they've got Arab actors playing a
pox on EES Pakistanis are indo-aryan did
a whole different race Pakistanis or not
Arabs that's a different race yes we
come in the category of brown but
Hispanics also come into the category on
so Hispanic Arabs indo-aryans
they are perpetuating racism the
perpetuating the notion that Pakistan is
an extremist nation
the producers of homeland Pakistan is a
country of 200 million people we
represent 4% of the world's population
we have more than 15 ethnicities we
speak more than 20 languages and to
reduce us to an acronym is that the
world we want to give we are your
biggest ally in the war on terror I'm
setting up an online network called
never forget fax on board from because
you don't actually learn about box on
from homeland but you learn about
Pakistan from Pakistanis</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
