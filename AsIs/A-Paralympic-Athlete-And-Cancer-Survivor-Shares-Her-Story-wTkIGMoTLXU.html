has shown me what life is worth and what
life's about
I was in a lot of pain I wasn't sleeping
at night I would wake up about 1:30 in
the morning just bawling because the
pain was so intense we knew I had some
sort of a tumor or growth that was
invading my whole kind of glute pelvic
area and so all the doctors from the
needle biopsy knew what was wrong with
me but nobody had told me until this
radiation doc and chemo doc come in to
tell me my options and as I'm listening
to the choice of I'm going to have to do
radiation or chemo it has now hit me
that these are things you do when you
have cancer and all I could keep
repeating was I don't want to die I
don't want to die so the doctor walks in
and says hey can you wiggle your toes
for a minute look at them why do you
want me to wiggle my toes and as I
looked down I could see that my left
foot my toes weren't wiggling and a few
hours later a physical therapist walk
walks in and says I'm here to teach you
how to walk again and I'm thinking I'm a
2004 Xterra world champion I'm a
professional mountain biker why do I
have to learn to walk again and it it
was the moment that I jumped out of the
bed thinking everything was fine that I
realized it wasn't I couldn't feel my
foot I couldn't move my foot I couldn't
control anything and it was a process of
learning to walk again and this is where
the competitive nature comes in these
older people would walk along and they
were kicking my butt and I could only
take two steps and this really drove me
nuts after about a week I figured out
how to get just around the nurse's
station but that wasn't good enough
because they were also beating me and so
I would tell my dad who was pushing
along on my IVs come on he's catching me
he's catching me but it was that it was
that drive to want to beat all of these
people that kept me going and that's all
I would focus on doctors told me I'd
never run again my pro career was over
and I'd probably never write anything
more than
stationary bike so I was determined to
that moment that I would figure out how
to get back on the bike and that's all I
did I did everything that would lead me
to getting back onto a bike one day bad
things happen to good people to get
matter to get angry or to cry will not
change your situation so it's you just
have to get into fight mode and you have
to put one good foot in front of the
other and you keep moving forward until
you get to where you want to be</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
