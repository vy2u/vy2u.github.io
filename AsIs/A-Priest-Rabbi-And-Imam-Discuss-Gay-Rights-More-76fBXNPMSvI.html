I can say that I'm pro-life in the sense
that I affirm every living human on this
earth and I'm prayerfully pro-choice we
respect the reproductive rights of women
in the Islamic tradition there are times
in which abortion is permissible but
generally if we try and affirm life but
there's a separate issue which is if you
disagree from whatever our religious
tradition is how do you go about
expressing that disagreement when you
talk to anybody who has difference
whether it's around abortion having guns
getting rid of guns all of these issues
that what we lack is an ability to
listen to each other and I think we
would all agree that and committing
active violence is a transgression not
just of the law but of our religious
values when you look at that text of
Genesis you see the part where it says
they were created in God's image
men and women yeah together men and
women have been created in equal footing
the Islamic tradition in many ways is a
feminist tradition from the teachings of
Muhammad in which he conveyed through
the message of the Quran that women have
the right to own property the rights in
her property to have the permission
before they're married off and they also
have the right to divorce however what
has happened is Lomb spread to other
chauvinistic patriarchal cultures and
culture Trump's religions arrests of
Muslims to understand or Jews or
Christians who continue to see women in
this terribly subservient role and back
it up with Scripture of all kinds and
keep women out of positions of power and
treat us in families in ways that are
just horrible I think education is the
key and that's why my focus right now is
is in education there has been always
strong women who have argued with their
fathers and grandfathers and brothers to
make room for themselves and thank God
they have because there have opened a
door that now at this moment of history
this very new moment in Jewish history
to allow for women rabbis
to be very transparent Islam suggests
that sexual relations should only take
place between a man and women in the
context of marriage
that being said to be homophobic or to
be discriminatory or to be exclusive is
against the values of Islam yeah I would
say to the question of homosexuality yes
I see homosexuality as an on-going
revelation and evolution of human
relationships and an expression a full
expression of God's love in the world
yeah I that argument that a gay or
lesbian wedding makes someone else's
marriage not whole is quite stunning
right I mean it's it's about bringing
more love into the world and the core of
our religious traditions are about love
I think that there are many paths to the
divine many revelations of God in the
world I believe that it's about
following Christ as opposed to making
people believe there's a verse in
chapter 2 of the Quran those who believe
Jews Christian savings whoever so
believes in God in the day of judgment
and does good will find the reward with
their Lord one of the things that
happens with folks who believe that
their way is the only way is that they
in this terrible blasphemous jump of
arrogance makes themselves God and out
of that they kill other people
unfortunately all three of our
traditions have humans who do this who
act as if they are God all three of our
traditions have terrorists who kill
humans in the name of it must be hatred
and violence because I won't call it God
they are not of God
take a risk and find someone of a
different tradition and ask about it ask
with curiosity and openness being moved
towards empathy towards their experience
action for justice actions of compassion
serving at soup kitchens together yes
doing the work of our faith traditions
in the on the streets and we can use the
organizing force of our communities to
not only address those as individual
communities but to get get to know one
another across religious traditions to
address some of the most important
issues facing our community in our world</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
