instantly ah honest this one's for you
girl
hey Salaam yeah you know who has really
tiny hands my a Girl Scout leader no
raccoons there's a scene in Pocahontas
it's like a beautiful setting your hair
is getting all breezy because it's lake
colors of the winds just happen so she's
like oh my god I have so much like
beautiful long hair am I gonna turn to
to braid my hair do I have any friends
in The Woodlands area no she has one
friend actually I know that girl with
the ponytail okay well John Smith sucks
I need a creature friend that has a
thumb it's Miko a raccoon her BFF no
rubberband Nina no hairspray just was
like but he did it done and then she's
just like on our way it's like straight
off of Instagram beautiful and I need to
know if a raccoon can do that I mean I
don't like raccoons I have to be real
with you why you want a little raccoon
that's been digging through the trash
sharp teeth rabies digging through your
hair yeah first of all reckons are being
cute and I wanna hang out with one and
second of all I want to see if this is
true the only way that we're gonna know
for sure is if it's right out so let's
do it
little hands they're so small
oh my god who are you I am crystal I
trained all kinds of different animals
for the movie industry well I've been
told that you can't just walk up to
raccoon and go like hey braid my hair
but sure way more intelligent than most
people give them credit for they're kind
of like a cross between a cat and a
monkey very mischievous it can be really
aggressive when they want to be when do
they want to be aggressive when they
want their stuff and you don't give it
to them what are the dangers involved
with the raccoon braiding your hair they
wanted to they can do some serious
damage you have animal with really sharp
teeth and really sharp claws like how
sharp between a house cat and a light do
they have rabies they can carry rabies
yes one of the raccoons is not a big fan
of blonds guys our director is blonde
what does it mean had a raccoon braid
her hair like in Pocahontas braids are
kind of complicated but maybe I'm just
that good of an animal trainer and I'll
teach my racquet another braid your hair
oh that's what I like we're gonna go
training I know that like death
important raccoon accepting me and
loving me more important we're here
today training with Hollywood animals
we're about to me to records are super
smart I hope
the raccoon will have to be on a leash
if anything were to happen we can pull
them off at first I'm going to kind of
face away not really make eye contact
because that can be a little bit
intimidating and stressful for them
I love raccoons and I hope they love me
or lb doesn't say this highlight of my
life ol tiny hands we go
we at the clipper and eat them so they
understand that every time we click they
get paid with food I'm really shocked
that the first time eating them they
were immediately doing pretty close to
what it looks like in Pocahontas take it
over you can take it over can they
actually braid I don't know they are
talented smart beautiful creatures I
can't hug them which is fine kind of
like they're a celeb but so Lauren's
gonna lose her mind when she sees these
raccoons because they're so cute
no actually she hates them right this is
the best day of my life
they suck
the pause you like little tiny baby
hands you're beautiful very smart very
smart oh you want to play are you so
much I got a honest this is
today's the day my friends we've got
drama
we've got danger we've got Disney you
know what else we have
Doritos tiny little hands I spent the
entire day training with two records
sometimes they feel like doing sometimes
sit down which honestly is like all of
us right let me just lay it out for you
all the stuff that you have to do if you
do want to like chill with the Rat King
which you shouldn't do first off never
put your racket in the wild they
couldn't have rabies
they probably have rabies that's not
sure they don't probably have it they
might have it she's getting ready calm
down they have really sharp teeth don't
make eye contact and I am NOT
around don't make eye contact they have
sharp claws they might be all like
pitter pattering around my eatin little
snack ease those things are really sharp
and they can literally claw through
human skin instantly if you have any
food near you just like don't just like
don't you're like I'm willing to take
this chance for all the Disney fans the
naysayers the raccoon haters how are you
feeling based on my one day of raccoon
training do you know they had us all
sign waivers today even our sound person
signed a waiver there's no going back
now you got to do the thing I wish you
the best Pocahontas this one's for you
girl let's go
I'm here in my fake forest so lorem how
you feeling I'm fine I'm fine
you scared you know you nervous no that
looks like a lie mm-hm I need to put my
hair into three beautiful strands for
the raccoon to grab just like you would
if you were doing a braid very trendy
thank you so much I'm using tiny little
rubber bands because they're teeny
little hands see little teeny little
rubber being a match so creepy with this
tiny hands then it's not creepy it's
just love bringing the record
all right dudes so far so good
I'm very hopeful very inspired this is
not church can we just do this thing
this is it baby I really hope this one
baby get up there good pick it up put it
here
Oh tight crab he's getting that she's
almost there
Daisy attempted of King braid but she
was like I'm gonna start I'm done I'm
just going to that's it I need a moment
of mourning
I thought this would happen and it
didn't okay spit grass all over me not
to be biased but I think this is one of
my favorite experiments but I have some
sad news to report this please promise
raccoons can't braid hair like that
that's how life is but a braid involves
crossing leaving all into one beautiful
strand and raccoons can do it Pocahontas
once for you girl we did it for you
even though mistake</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
