live past the age of 20 my name is Leah
Juliet and I am the executive director
and founder of the march against revenge
porn when I was 14 years old I was in a
small town high school I was in the
closet as being gay and I was asked for
nude photos
I was asked for nude photos by a boy who
didn't have my best interests in mind I
kind of had a crush on him but more so I
thought that him liking me would help me
advance in the school pipeline where
acceptance was all about popularity at
first I of course said no because I was
always taught that nudity and sexuality
in any form was inappropriate and I felt
the need to satisfy love and acceptance
that I wasn't getting from anywhere else
I sent for photos but before I sent them
I asked him if he would send them to
anyone else and he laughed at me
he was almost surprised that I would
question his trust and then he went on
to ruin my life because I had only sent
photos from my stomach up including my
breasts and my face I hadn't satisfied
his urges I didn't include pictures of
my vagina and after realizing that it
was pathetic I stopped and I told him no
and that's when he lost interest in me
and after a while I started to come out
as being gay somewhere along the lines
something that I did upset him he sent
the pictures to everyone in the school
the first time that I was told that my
photos had been sent to other people I
was sitting in science class and my lab
partner across the table from me took
out his phone and showed me my own
pictures I laughed it off and then
proceeded to die inside I left the class
brant in the bathroom and tried to throw
up tried to cry but nothing came out all
that existed was my own shame sitting at
the pit of my stomach I was later
informed that he had posted the pictures
on a website called a non I be a photo
sharing website where anyone can
anonymously and strategically upload
pictures of non-consenting victims my
photos were attached to my name and
I was terrified of my family of my
friends of School Administrators finding
out what I had done I had seen other
girls get in trouble for sending nude
pictures in the past because technically
it fell under the category of child
pornography and society automatically
assumes that anyone who sends new
pictures is inherently wrong so I stayed
silent I retracted myself from
activities at the same time sunk into a
pit of depression PTSD anxiety self-harm
and suicidal ideation I genuinely didn't
think that I would live past the age of
20 when I was a freshman in college I
opened up my laptop and I saw the
mugshot of the boy who had posted my
naked pictures online staring back at me
a news article said that he was on the
run from the police for sexually
assaulting a minor that was the moment
that I knew that revenge porn and other
cyber crimes lead to actual physical
sexual violence I immediately felt
guilty and I thought that perhaps had I
spoken out beforehand he wouldn't have
gone on to hurt other people I started
by using the only tool that I had my
voice and a pen I wrote a poem and I
performed that poem all across the state
of Connecticut I was able to take my
voice back to take my story and tell it
on my own terms and he could never
silence me again I traveled to
Washington DC and performed the poem at
the Brave New Voices international slam
poetry competition while I was there I
made a sign that said end revenge porn
and I held it up while standing in front
of the White House that was the first
time I ever advocated on behalf of
myself and on behalf of other revenge
porn victims like me a month later when
I was finally home I decided to found
the march against revenge porn the first
march against revenge porn was held on
April 1st 2017 across the Brooklyn
Bridge six months after the first March
I was contacted by the Office of New
York City Mayor Bill DeBlasio and was
told that he had seen the revenge porn
activism that I had completed and that
he was signing a bill into law
criminalizing revenge porn as a
misdemeanor in the city of New York
currently only 38 states
the united states have revenge porn
legislation and every state is different
in some states it's a Class A
misdemeanor
while in other states it's a felony I
decided to bring the march against
revenge porn to different cities that
have different revenge porn laws to shed
light and bring attention to the fact
that these disproportionate laws are
affecting our communities
my personal victimization almost took my
own life I know now that I have a reason
to live and that is to help others and
to make sure that nobody experiences
revenge porn victimization in the same
way that I did it is now my life's work
to ensure that victims seek justice and
revenge porn is criminalized nationwide</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
