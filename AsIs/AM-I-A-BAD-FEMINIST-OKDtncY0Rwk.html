can't say that you're objectifying her I
think she feels empowered being made
that up there I think she's been
conditioned to feel sexualized am i a
good feminist is it okay if I shaved my
life
well that depends are you doing it to
uphold a beauty standard it's because
you want to swim better I see thank you
one guy's open the door for me
yeah but say it in German so you sound
real angry about that Chris Brown song
comes on the radio I have to change it
right absolutely yes if it's your car no
if it's an uber my cousin Candace put
something about feminism on Facebook do
I have to like it
yeah but you don't have to read it I
still like porn if it's live-action and
you feel that the actress is empowered
by her choices yes if it's animated
absolutely yes Buffy anti-feminist
because she killed all those female
vampires or was she just treating them
as equals no because she was killing
them because of who they were as people
not who they were as women a meanest
vampire yes do I have to vote for
Hillary yes do I have to carry heavy
things by myself did I call my cousin
Candace a bitch to her face yeah she's
being a bitch I have allowed to still
give blowjobs I can only do it as
emotional blackmail okay
what if I only have one tampon left and
a girl I don't like asks for it do I
have to give it to her mm-hmm
do I have to give Candace a tampon I
just wish to pass because tampons are so
phallic probably I have to buy that new
period underwear that absorbs all my
blood it's in your budget
oh god can I say that I think Beyonce's
overrated shut your mouth you bitch I'm
sorry I just I hate when women hate
other women but as a follow-up I see a
woman choking to death in the street am
i morally obligated to save her life yes
okay but what if it's my bitch cousin
Candace I allowed to enjoy a movie that
doesn't pass the Bechdel test is it okay
that I illegally streamed Mad Max fury
road it okay if I hate myself I mean my
my cousin Candace my life
it's your constitutional right girl is
it bad if I don't want that to be a
woman can I weigh in here
well she's breaking the fourth wall do
you really think that you can be a good
feminist if you're only thinking within
the scope of your white cisgendered
mostly heterosexual experience
I'm clearly Jewish okay as hell I have
an olive complexion I studied abroad
with a backpack perfect</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
