interesting one Australia Day what is
Australia Day
don't you mean invasion day means
different things to different people for
us it means survival invasion day our
survival survival day and celebrations
of survival of one of the oldest
cultures if not the oldest culture on
earth racism I think a joke just really
sad my gut drops is the fact that they
celebrate that day that we lost all the
we had yeah visit me on it's insensitive
to say the least
an offense that's everything at once
Brotherhood sisterhood Claire and mob
strength it does bring up a lot of hurt
a lot of heartache it's like somebody
that comes into your house does horrible
things to your family and they like oh
dude we're gonna like have like a party
and have a barbecue and listen to Triple
J yeah and we're going to put it on the
date we turned up you're like
it's kind of statistic man like what
would you do that people celebrating the
day that your people got slaughtered and
invaded and the day that caused all that
destruction and all their suffering to
very peaceful people for a lot of
Aboriginal people and Torres Strait
Islanders it's a day of mourning
it's a day that marks the beginning of
the massacres its celebrating rape its
celebrating murders I celebrate so many
things about being here about how
beautiful this country is but at the
same time there's a dark and
disconnected culture I think that our
country is a great country and it's
beautiful and there are a lot of
opportunities here I feel that
celebrating Australia Day on the 26th of
January is wrong that doesn't make any
sense
the first of January 1901 was when the
state's federated to become a country
it was loosely called Australia before
then it became official this was now the
nation called Australia the Commonwealth
of Australia that should be Australia
Doug if it's truly a celebration of what
we are as a nation then we include the
first nations of this country a day that
we could all celebrate I'll help you
celebrate it if you like we're quite
inclusive people so
we just want to be included as well
maybe you should celebrate Australia as
a whole and as it was before and think
about who's included in that culture
when you're celebrating</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
