with my family I still remember your
face even though you probably don't
remember mine I was 14 years old we rode
the same school bus so I just turned 18
it's 21 and I was sitting on the bus on
my way back home I met you and your
friend at a convention I don't even know
who you are you live down the road from
me
my senior class trip supported by our de
you were part of an American snowboard
team that was on my flight on the way
down you just came up to me and started
a conversation about where I lived where
I was from something like that I can't
exactly remember what your Excuse was it
was the first night of the cruise and we
all decided to kind of go to this teen
dance party which I thought would be
really fun I was waiting for a drink
when you and your friends surrounded me
probably about five maybe seven of you
and started to brand my body with
stickers advertising your snowboard team
I thought you were just walking me back
to the a gentleman but when I got to the
room I put my key in the lock and you
forced the door open and forced yourself
on top of pain
you came up to me on the bus in front of
everyone in front of my brother and
grabbed my chest and said oh they're not
fake they just grew I don't know who you
are or where you're going or why even
targeted me and you said I really like
how you're dancing and then you put your
hand on my upper thigh and slid it under
my dress and grabbed me by the it
was all so fast but you touched me in a
way that I felt violated afterward and
that counts you asked me what was wrong
but I couldn't answer you because I
didn't really understand what was going
on I didn't know if you were going to
rape me or kill me or both know what to
do in that moment I look back on it all
the time and wish I would have hit you I
wish I would have said something to you
I wish I would have told you that's not
okay I eventually got you to leave but I
already had bruises and hickeys on my
neck
from you and the next day I was so
embarrassed to be seen in public with
them knowing what had happened and
feeling like it was my fault somehow I
turned around and protested and when I
did you very deliberately took a sticker
and pressed it across my chest and then
you grabbed me by the I was left
not really sure what to do or what to
say I was embarrassed I was scared and
confused so I went to my older cousin I
told her I wasn't feeling well and she
took me back to my room and I pretended
to go to bed but I really just cried
myself to sleep when I got home and told
my roommate what happened she asked if I
was okay and I said why it's not like he
raped me and she said what but that's
still sexual assault though I thought
you and your friends were gonna drag me
off into the streets supported by
artists and probably rape me in fact at
the time I was pretty sure that that's
what was happening but instead I grabbed
you by the balls and squeezed as hard as
I could until you fell to the floor and
your friends just laughed at you
this experience wasn't violent but it
was violating and it counts</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
