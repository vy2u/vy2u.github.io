denim that's a zipper that's a penis
immediately hands in the air
I thought your dick was popcorn I'm so
sorry I would probably make a joke out
of it I would just be like huh and then
I probably let them touch mine that's a
boob graze classic boob graze it depends
how long the brush is a little bit just
play it off cool just nothing happened
nothing I would say absolutely nothing I
would be happy about it the old someone
touched your penis that's happened
actually a couple of times I use my
hands a lot when I talk I would probably
pretend it didn't happen
conversation pauses and you do not
address it in that case as the girl I
would be like I am so sorry cuz odds are
if you hit a dick with even the smallest
amount of force you've hurt someone I've
gotten the dick in the shoulder many
times but I've also given a few digs you
would turn your head first if it keeps
hitting you then you have to say like
I'm so sorry can you your penis is
hitting my face part of you wants to
just kind of like like hit it a little
bit so it's like your dick is in my face
can you get it out my face okay mom
Kenny is being a dick it won't give me
the map what do you do when you touch
your sister's boob if I touched if I
touch my sister's boob
I would ill nope noob you say you're
sorry and then you move to another state
let's never talk about this again the
scenario was a locker room and I was
going for my bag
in the gym and he walked in the way and
I accidentally put my hand against his
junk like how do you know what you're
touching half the time anyway</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
