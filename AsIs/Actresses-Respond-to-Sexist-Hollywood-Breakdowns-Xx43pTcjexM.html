rolls then like what's the content
female brunette mid-20s looking for a
young 20s hot and beautiful to play
girlfriend or just with great body
beautiful mom model looks and body
Oh mother Wow this role doesn't have a
name but she's called attractive
girlfriend large eyes small chin wide
cheeks long nose or a combination of all
three times in this breakdown sexy was
used
she eats delicious chocolate-covered
berries and cuddles with her boyfriends
like I would do that one probably like
for the berries Oh God
I've read this one principal female all
ethnicities 18 to 30 beautiful girl in a
sexy dress throwing up in a toilet
if contracted we may request video
submission of you and a sexy dress
throwing up I don't think I've ever seen
a breakdown for a woman where it doesn't
include like beautiful girl-next-door
are sexy and hot I've seen ones that
like ask you to wear a push-up bra just
you have faker pips
no nonsense my favorite euphemism for
urban big booty can dance kind of
thuggish every time I go out lately
they're always like we want you to be
like the hot chick slash mistress you
become a little numb to it and I don't
know any actresses that don't feel
concerned that they are inadequate and
how much character breakdowns are
contributing to that I guess I guess
that's hard to say but I have always
known that that was an expectation and I
think you see that born out in the way
that you know as soon as actresses start
to age there's so much fear about losing
that currency I also feel like no one in
this town really knows what over-40
looks like I go out for a lot of like
mom stuff which is funny cuz I'm 25 who
should I say my age so film and media
represent what's going on in our society
the way we cast is it's weird it's
really weird
exchange art is only important because
we're showing the world that we all go
through the same things and if you
separate women for that we feel like
we're not a part of that world I know
that the solution is about always
creating your own work it inspires I
think myself and other people to go
against this machine I'm Christina and
I'm an actor thatthey dominant powerful
real complex</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
