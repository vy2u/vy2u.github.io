in cognitive sciences film kinesiology
business biological sciences health
science psychology and education my
college education has prepared me for
the future I feel really excited
prepared and not scared to get into that
real world you guys got me what's that
before I have no clue I have taken to
accounting classes but w-4 has never
come up something that sounds like it
would I feel that like my FAFSA it's a
wage for him I don't feel comfortable at
all during my taxes I'll probably hire
an accountant I don't know I have heard
of a 401 K but nobody has gone in depth
about it in my business classes no I'm
not familiar with retirement plans I
know what this is okay so a 401 K it's
when you get a job and they pay you and
then it goes into your 401 K so when you
are senior and you retire you are set to
go enough money in the bank so I could
take my old wife out on dates
IRA okay the people who audit you comes
after you if you don't pay your taxes
the IRS god dang it
wait so what is that you don't want a
really high credit score I've seen those
commercials for like Credit Karma
so credit score is if you like have a
credit card and you get billed and if
you pay on time then your credit card
score goes up I'm very clueless about
this as well health uh so HMO is what
most people have they play like a
monthly thing and then when they go to
the doctor they have to pay
I can't use the word copay copay okay
did someone just explain this to me to
you guys PPO someone spelled people
wrong I don't know this is primary
people officer
it's private insurance now looking back
I wouldn't say College has prepared me
in all the areas that I'd probably need
to be an adult college prepares you for
your specific major colleges should
offer real-life applicable classes if me
or my parents are paying 40 grand a year
for four years more and I'm not learning
about any of this real world stuff I
think they should definitely take a look
at it likely to this video now I know
all these things and I'm all set for the
real world so thanks BuzzFeed my
silliest education classes dancing world
cultures would you go to
to bless the space and suspicious fresh
near I took this class called scepticism
101 where it just taught you how to be a
skeptic</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
