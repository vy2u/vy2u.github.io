this missing is our moms the first day
of school is around the corner or maybe
it already happened we haven't been to
school in a while but the most fun part
of back-to-school
besides the books duh is a fashion but
can we olds join in on the fun
it's ladylike and we're trying
back-to-school style back-to-school was
a thing it was a nerve-wracking time but
a fun time I loved school new erasers
give me a high like nothing else every
year I would make my mom buy me like new
notebooks I'd like this is the year I
get it together I sort of got my fashion
sense from whatever host was on 106 &amp;amp;
Park on bTW so free Roxie any of the
rotating hosts anything that they had on
I was like okay this is fresh this is
fly I knew about back-to-school fashions
either from commercials like Kohl's
commercials or like the hills somewhere
in between my mom would always get me a
bunch of like new shirts and I would
have to try all them on I sound really
ungrateful because she would buy me
stuff and I'm complaining about it but I
was like I really just wanted to wear
t-shirts so here we are with four
magazines
two of which might have nothing to do it
back to school but I thought we had to
get j14 so we're gonna dive into these
bad boys for some back-to-school inspo
Jen don't trip slip dresses miss out on
the best trend to come back from the 90s
as if what our slip dresses like they
look like they could be under your
clothes oh the best that you had in
dress one Oh
this works out Jen they say you can wear
it under a Faneuil I went to find myself
some flannel that's actually all I need
and then I'm like okay I'll take ten
velvet anything miniskirt and
military-inspired
look at is this a dress the doer this
with pants this look like it's big
enough for me no medium where's the
video I just found a page about bomber
jackets and then embroider things are
very in apparently and like leather ish
backpacks like small non useful
backpacks what about all your books the
hell can fit me apparently
adidas are in you video spread of your
case with Jesus hats dad hat yeah this
hat says pay me which i think is really
funny really like this hat it seems very
on brand for both teens and me I do want
a bomb and jacket he did find an
inexpensive totally I would like to
purchase this jacket and I think that if
we hit up the spot H&amp;amp;M forever 21
Charlotte Russe she's really
see if we can find a wet shield what I
do like is that the spots haven't
changed when we were trying stuff on in
there we had a tea who was helping us
yeah we met a teen named Cassidy and she
told us her opinions our outfits yeah
they look good
but we obviously we can't put her in the
video because she's underage yeah take
our word for it though Cassidy is very
real and very much supportable we were
wearing
all right the day is here this is what
I'm wearing today is gonna be great
dance the first day of school and I am
unhappy about it last night didn't do
much but I did try and go to sleep
slightly earlier than I would have
because I never used to sleep in high
school my nerves have calmed down a
little bit now that I'm here I'm in my
element I feel like my outfit is really
screaming you know Beck school slay I
feel like overall I'm pretty pleased
with my outfit in my high school hats
we're not allowed it would be snatched
off my head this is a bomber jacket
which is very trendy right now I guess
the kids are really into this like
floppy material this skirt I keep trying
to pull it down a little bit because
it's just like kind of grazing the
fingertip rule I had this flannel on to
keep my shoulders warm I added like a
little choker teen so we wear chokers
back in the day
and then lil sneaks I probably would
have chosen like combat boots but these
little sneakers seem to be on trend I
can fit my wallet and my cell phone in
this backpack and lipgloss
I feel like Elizabeth would definitely
like this outfit I think my mom like you
know probably wants to pop a bottle on
every time I wear a dress
hey Ricky it's the first day of school
why would you say that you don't like
school Alex do you like school so I
don't typically wear my glasses on
camera but I felt like it was necessary
and relevant to the first day of school
better corduroy sorry yeah I'm not mad
thanks curly you just made my first day
of school even better he doesn't let
your mommy tell ya so we are clearly
upperclassmen so we're gonna go off
campus for lunch you don't want to sit
in a cafeteria the first day you what I
mean yeah let it settle yeah I said on
the ground a lot we're eating like teams
texta my gut and zucchini to picture my
outfit she says yeah you look cute kind
of gone fish but the backpack really
doesn't and then I told her we're back
to school
no hassle out in school I tasted my mom
and she responded with dress looks cute
you don't need the shirt around the
waist though
which is wrong because you always need
flannel it is very warm though it is
warm we're honoring like long sleeves
and stuff I'm like pit sweating inside
sweating but that's pretty much how I
was in high school so you look good and
we both have on flannel Conservation's
flannel means practice school do you
look like we did it yeah first day of
school
in the can nobody else at the office
knew that it was supposed to be the
first day of school in fact some people
were upset when I told them that was the
first day of school they were like why
would you do this to me this is not
quite like high school there were a lot
more people with cameras here than usual
I did feel that first day of school like
excite little excitement I think I
secretly liked the first day of school
our resident team expert Lindsay put
about the backpack okay okay I own a
holographic backpack did tell me that I
should probably be wearing my flannel
around my waist but not too thinner
the good thing about the jacket is you
can just zip it up look if you saw the
assistant principal and you ran away you
could kind of get away with stuff in my
high school my high school actually
didn't have a dress code so you could
wear Spanx and you'd probably be fine
Jen also went to the high school that
Mean Girls is based off of yeah it was
incredibly me what yeah that was just
high school I think we just look young
you
great it looks like you're ready to rock
the eighth grade though I will say that
this is nicer than anything I actually
wore in high school would you guys wear
these trends again anything with a final
I'll put on my body I will absolutely
wear this slip dress again probably with
a jean jacket back to school fashion we
lady like this one two three yeah we did
it is that good graduation we took a
little detour and bought matching pajama
bottoms black pants long pants you can
wear them on the town</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
