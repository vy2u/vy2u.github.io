you're the best
and everybody's the best I think people
get drunk to break down walls that they
build up for me it's more of a control
issue like I'll have one mixed drink and
then I'm like okay this is good I'm
leaving or I'm driving friend's home
when I was younger someone I love got
really drunk I fell asleep in their own
vomit and in their own feces and that
has always made me afraid of alcohol I
was always the one that was kind of like
taking care of everybody and you know I
have a sip or a drink here and there but
I never got to lose control I guess I'm
ready to try new things I'm into
experimenting now I've always been sober
so I'm curious what my own personality
would be like when I'm drunk this is
something that I feel like I maybe
should have done by now or at least want
to experience once and so it's I think
it's just getting over a fear that I've
always had I'd like to find out more
about myself even if I don't like that
part of myself Oh God
man I'm feeling it tastes like hatred
this is the mistake train feel like an
octopus I felt like this when I hit my
head really hard once my arms have
multiplied my fingers are going farther
than I am
anything is possible what do they feel
comfortable no they're too long
it's just thrown into universe and
everything's gone and you're like a
little sad but you also kind of want to
dance at the same time I thought I
wasn't gonna cry right like I want to
fart and sleep all night long this is
that weird I'm feeling like warm and
happy I'm not really worried about
anything stomach feels like a box of
clams
I'm definitely gone I feel like every
breath is my last and it has to be
important oh and extra sensory receptors
this is amazing your hair looks like a
really good pillow right now I miss my
friend oh my god your hair smells like a
fantasy you like just centered in on Who
I am
I feel like I'm just happy I got seep I
feel like I was cooler before this all
happened
I like myself more I feel more confident
I can say things and be like yeah that's
what I wanted to say oh no oh no it's
okay because this is terrible the highs
were not worth it down
can you tell me what's going on right
now
I'm just
I feel so far getting drunk is like the
ultimate advertising for sleeping
I feel like completion I learned
something too
and that's don't drink that extreme
person is hey and that you should love
yourself okay so back when I was drunk I
was very comfortable with myself and I
wondered why I didn't feel that way when
I was sober I'm pretty happy I went
through that experience you know did
have some down moments if you're looking
to escape from being self-conscious or
trying to be more confident by drinking
I think it's probably better to try and
do that while you're completely present
and sober so that it stays with you
longer if you drink too much you're
gonna throw up you're gonna black out
maybe that's some people have bad
experiences the alcohol took me on a
magical mystery tour that ended in the
Boulevard of broken dreams
the good news is that I overcame my fear
the bad news is that I feel like catch</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
