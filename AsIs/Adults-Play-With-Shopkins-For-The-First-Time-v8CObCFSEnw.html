this is this is this this is it I
thought my coworker toy it's not weird
see I'm a big fan of good old toy mm-hmm
you know I like Sims a lot that's not a
toy that's a video game it counts oh
cool where these like the mini Japanese
like a toy wait wait they're not
Japanese and I don't
these are shopkins and they're
apparently hugely popular they're
collectible little guys they're shopkins
so there are things that you can buy so
do they get do they get bigger when you
make them in this is that like the game
no they don't grow there's nothing
happens to them and they also if you'll
notice these are the perfect size for
choking and they also look like food now
this is possibly the worst toy for a
child this is the face of the deadliest
toy in America you can't see them
there's apparently two hidden shopkins
inside so I guess that there's like rare
shopkins that people will like spend a
lot of money on but what do they do
nothing it looks like you can put them
on a pencil do you want to see what our
two surprise shopkins are and we'll see
how rare they are oh oh it's a phone
wait what it's a phone
who's this fan I don't know it's a
pencil it's a pink pencil it's a pink
pencil penny pencil special edition oh
this one's my favorite one it's a
deep-fryer didn't get in there just get
in it'll be great it'll be wonderful
free to be inside I like that it's clear
like that whoever painted these two was
like it and just like put like a
paintbrush on them the instructions on
how to play with this is buy more of
this yeah I think the fan is the least
fun one but I get my concern is I don't
really totally know how you would
effectively play with it what do you
mean this one's I have fun should
revolve around buying things it should
well run your imagination
okay so let's rate this my first thing
they are going talk about is overall
beauty that's pretty pretty it's a
pretty pretty picture if I had to say it
I ever saw one I guess if you're gonna
make thousands and thousands of
different figurines you maybe probably
can't put as much detail as you'd like
into all of them fun level they're
billing yeah fun they're not very fun I
feel like you really got to use your
imagination for these and then I'll
scale of one to ten happy babies four
and a half happy babies three happy
babies because I just feel like this is
a trick doesn't know why it was you kill
it this spatula is not named the all the
other inanimate objects are alive with
the spatula soulless</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
