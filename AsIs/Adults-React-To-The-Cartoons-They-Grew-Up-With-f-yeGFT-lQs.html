like a weasel
we're like a mass and Muffy was like the
sassiest thing you've ever seen she was
no cold I you need to know what he is it
doesn't matter what he is
he's like a rat but then they have a pet
dog but then one of their friends is a
dog he's actually an aardvark budgie the
little helicopter I feel like I had a
bit of a like crush on budgie it's
pretty hot I always used to think they
some will chase your underwears always a
vegetable are cool
this was my jam it's actually kind of
freaky like these you got the shocker
all the stalk and bananas is chasing
after these kids they need to bring back
the humans in life-size banana six like
you know yes this was my first CD that I
ever owned like soundtrack I remember
watching the cartoon but I can't
remember what they did other than just
dance hello my name is nut see and I
spent half my life I was running after
blinky bill etc so they had interesting
news like splodge the kangaroo there are
like euphemisms for penises and vaginas
I never noticed that
haha Babar is the most amazing finchy
wait did it in an Esther se glass
drastic pop yes that's the Jurassic Park
thing Oh didn't his parents get shot
Richards huh I feel like this is a
sad show it was really all about ethics
and morals iconic a hipster before it
was cool I really identified with this
moment where she just failed at the spot
she taught me how to be dead inside I
mean I loved it but I just kind of made
me bitter when I was 10 years old in a
dark dark house they were like a
skeleton very heteronormative I had a
dream that my mom accepted the funny
bones into her life and kicked me out of
her house because she now had the funny
bones and she doesn't lead you
you I wanted to be loved Madeline
I bet whatever Madeline is today she's
like a scientist or a brain surgeon or
something she had a together front
of oh that's true so good I had a crush
on Rocco he was meant to be a wallaby
wasn't me and then the older you got you
started to get the like weird and weird
jokes and it got even funny I write Oh
where's Marley Oh where's wally Becky's
yeah yeah love this
you had like 30 seconds on the screen
and the clock is ticking down loved
where's well you're right about Rodney
Dangerfield on far bigger I actually
wanted much bunchy Louella coffee now
everything looks different everything
has its own special I study and I feel
like that is so lost at the moment when
everything's animated I want to go back
and watch Rocko's Modern Life again
there's always a character that was
really a pathetic and like down on life
yeah I feel like it just prepared me for
the future yeah it is like look man it's
a tough world get used to it totally
walk ASAP</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
