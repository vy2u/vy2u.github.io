my coworker a toy is that weird
do you not normally like play with
stories I really appreciate cute stuffed
animals anything animal honestly is kind
of my go-to alright look at this present
oh you wanted yes we set it up hey oh my
god
unwrapping presence is one of my
favorite things to do it's pet so this
is the clever keet little live pet can
we open him yes of course
get the out of here clever he I
shan't tell promise to always take good
care of my clever keet feed him /her
as much as needed dance to music and
laugh at silly jokes together those are
all your favorite things Chantelle
alright baby
it says unclamp in your free clinic hey
ha ha ha oh we put my hairpin right here
diving this is a smartest child I've
ever had
smartest child is a starter he wants to
watch TV how'd you find her ha ha ha ha
oh my god there we go
what if I just like harm fish
immediately Harley wants to just name
him Keith ok this will be Keith the
parakeet aperitif I want to see him
dance as long as where he dances I think
you have to play music he's got his own
jams play blank space I don't think it
works
who do you think is the man who voices
this bird I don't think it's a man how
we good seems ah was he broken no he
says oh man you should have been like I
get away it has to be because that's
like oh he's fine I'm fine I'm bored
hi Keith do you want to dance are you
wanted by the soul of a dead bird I
suppose those recording you without
hahahaha
so I know like when I was a kid if I
would get a new toy it would be playing
with it maybe for like a week this would
be a solid week on a scale of 1 to 10 I
would I would give it a solid solid 9
what would what would push it over the
edge for you to attend if it had a
little bit more clever responses well to
be fair we only played with it for about
10 minutes
hahaha this bird is gone this bird is
good when is gorgeous
I've never seen a bird so good
it's just so sad what's happening over
there oh yeah you don't know the half of
it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
