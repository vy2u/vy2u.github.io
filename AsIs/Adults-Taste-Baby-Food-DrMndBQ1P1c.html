it's called Beechnut I don't understand
why we make babies eat combinations that
we would never eat it looks like baby
food
ma oh oh my god it's so good the
aftertaste is like really nasty beer
they actually have heartburn now little
Young's organic teething waivers IOT
pumpkin and banana nut up that is this
is a good combination this looks like
styrofoam a little dry it almost ripped
some of the flesh off to my lip your
lips touch them and they get like stuck
I don't know what it is but there's fun
this is fun food little stick it's the
grossest rap name I've ever heard I
don't want this oh he looks silly
I can't even get the meat stick out how
do you babies do this
you took a hot dog out of its casing and
then put a band-aid around that fork
it's not that bad it's gross a hot dog
that's been preserved in for now laughs
is it chicken
what would you meet oh that's weird what
I'm learning is that baby food isn't
even as good as dog food garden
vegetable when it's peas spinach in kind
40 calories that's not bad
yeah oh oh it's peas no I see wet baby
spit this doubt this is awful I like the
airplane now I kind of wish I was fed
like that all the time
chicken and chicken gravy glad we're not
giving babies chicken without gravy it
smells in terrible it smells like tuna
it looks raw hot amazing this is awful
it tastes like bones when her babies cry
so much premium infant formula this is
the formula
should we make inference from
ready-to-use don't add water don't
refrigerate don't give up about your
baby tastes like milk and kimchi mixed
together I can sit on the front porch
you know drink some of this this one's
breast milk is what's it taste like yeah
doesn't taste bad just the thing I've
been in a lot of taste this videos and
that was one of the worst things I've
ever eaten babies have it the worst man</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
