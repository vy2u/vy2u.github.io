what I would tell my teenage self is
your parents aren't always right don't
worry about pleasing other people so
much it's totally ok if you don't like
field hockey
you don't like your book quit it what's
important is what you're putting back
into the world and how you feel about
yourself only sleep with people you
actually like oh my god your first
boyfriend is not gonna be your last
boyfriend or girlfriend whatever I wish
I had to come out a bit sooner you'll
get into a serious relationship when
you're ready be more confident with boys
march to the beat of your own drum
there's someone who's also playing the
same beam find your people find your
community find people who you can trust
who you can connect with who you can be
yourself with you don't have to have
friends who make you feel bad about
yourself there are people who will like
you exactly as you are be yourself don't
worry about what's cool worry about the
things that bring you joy you only get
to be a teenager once so don't try to
grow up too fast
always wear a lot of cargo pants cargo
shorts so you can carry your pencils and
whatever you might need to carry listen
you might not look cool but hey who's
gonna be laughing when you're able to
carry five six pencils at a time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
