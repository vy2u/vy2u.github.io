boobs he said I come to realize them
dressing rooms so today we're gonna be
trying on the best selling dresses on
Amazon I buy everything on Amazon
but clothes I tend to have trouble
because I am 6 feet tall when it comes
to dresses I'm like really really in
between sizes so I don't like shopping
for them online
my expectations are low like I'm not
expecting to be like as you Bungie gone
off the runways of Paris I'm hoping they
all look good and if they don't that's
probably not Amazon's fault it's
probably on me just fixing like let's
use a little short like it's like a
t-shirt I guess I gonna keep pulling it
down you look so good
wow this is going to be I like that
thing I love the long boxy that's great
for me because when I bent that problem
it's too short and usually in the back
I'm wearing a jacket because like this
is happening
hits the like where I prefer it to I
think like right a lot of the times I
looked out Eve if it hits like right
below the knee yeah I would consider
buying this for sure it's so basic in
its construction in that it's just a
short sleeve dress that you could do a
lot with it in respect to styling it
feels like a nightgown is material and
like I can like have like the most epic
nap in the world with this I mean that
makes it appealing that makes it very
appealing taken up yes at the ten dollar
mark I think would be my limit but I
would also probably buy this first
this Hut has approximately 7,000 buttons
10 years later there's a hole in a ball
it's loose it's very boobs having the
opposite problem there's like a little
flap inside so like if it does start to
stretch out a little bit you have like
that little extra layer of like
protection that won't be like a gap the
bus is obviously not doing what it's
supposed to be doing but like I knew
that going in this dress is perfect for
my 5/3 it's really nice to actually have
something that I'm not like pulling up I
think you can have some killer Instagram
picture I need like flowers in my hair I
need a guitar and then I need to be on
the graph the style of this dress is
very conducive to like vacations I would
definitely consider a dress like this
for like a trip or specific event I'm
gonna hold my leather jacket in front
because this is too short in the front
all right
see this is cute this is finally the one
it's like a manicure while the rest of
the dress is too big on me these are
pretty snug because obviously like this
is working for me I'm gonna have more
boobs they would probably like fill out
if I could like I don't you sometimes
coffee in the bag look she if you're on
the front some tall girls beware it hits
like right above the knee so it gives me
time to like you know get a little girly
it's very comfortable like the pirate is
super soft it's like what feel
mine I took a pic oh yeah I know hers
not mine is like my sauce okay so very
similar dresses to this at like hmm at
the very similar price point if not a
little bit higher the quality is equals
is it cute like I'm gonna go to the bar
bullseye of sacrifice in doing it's cute
yeah you would do quite well let's go
I'm just mad that like my boobs were
like so big that like they decided to
take over two entire dresses I basically
got what I expected which was kind of
like fast fashion lower quality pieces
of clothing at like more affordable
prices and you would already get them
reading the reviews cuz a lot of girls
are really helpful and put their
measurements and what sizes they bought
and that's like a good sizing guys I
usually ignore them and just go to my
usual size but as you guys can see that
doesn't always work if I were to order
stuff from Amazon it probably lost me
like one season I would definitely buy
them like they're really cheap they feel
really nice then they look more
expensive than like you bought them for
it felt really good on my body and that
makes you feel awesome like if clothes
make you feel good then you should buy
them is my motto</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
