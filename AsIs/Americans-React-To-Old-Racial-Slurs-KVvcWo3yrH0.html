somebody you're an idiot
is this supposed to be offensive that
sounds like a good thing I use it in my
everyday yeah right I can use that now
to lump all of those people in one term
it's just rude how did that apply to
East Asia donkey I don't know I feel
like that that's an animal it's pretty
dehumanizing
that's pretty plea to be like compared
to an animal that was literally bred for
the purposes of like getting done and
like not anything else
whoa huh look at regular there you go
well huh look at me hey sounds like an
anime character you have like countries
that like strongly dislike each other
that are all being grouped into one term
and there's like a million languages I
feel like the terms that we use now are
a lot more characteristic of like
culture than just being from a certain
place I hope that we do live in a world
that we can you know forget about the
words that we have today you know what
like the best part about this is is like
all these words are so ridiculous
sounding now and that means we're
putting them to shame hopefully we get
to a point where we realize how stupid
it was to ever discriminate against
anything and can laugh at every word cuz
it's all in the past
but we're not anywhere near there yet
