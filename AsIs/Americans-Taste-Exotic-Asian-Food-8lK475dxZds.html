regional Asian cuisines they are an
enormous ly popular ingredient in soups
or eaten ala carte as a savory snack or
entree looks at a chicken it is like
gimme its feet brings a whole new
meaning to the term you shake hands I'm
just gonna do we eat the bone it's kind
of like a chicken wing but all skin
nothing's that bad it would be better if
it didn't look like a foot just a bony
floppy mess not though it's a
traditional Japanese food made from
fermented soybeans studies have
indicated vast health benefits from the
consumption of this unique breakfast
dish okay I hope that's cheese oh oh
this tastes like rotten beans its bitter
definitely peanut poop it tastes like
it's fermented but it's not it's not bad
I cannot possibly say and no horrible
things about it many Southeast Asians
regard durian as the king of fruits it's
most distinctive feature is its powerful
aroma making it a difficult Teleca sea
to find in stores and restaurants here
that it's super smelly so we're done
right we don't eat it tablecloth this is
not a pretty taste good right
no the taste is not as bad as this melt
but it is not a good taste I use mango
garlic I like mango and I like garlic

telling you do not eat this balut
is a developing duck embryo that is
boiled and eaten in the shell it's a
common street food in the Philippines in
Southeast Asia and his best one served

sesame seasoning oh it's a live it's
moving around you don't you know suction

terror oh oh it's moving just all the
way oh oh wow you're making out with
someone and trying to eat understand
that I really feel like I'm killing
something right now and it feels great
yeah I'm totally stuck to my tooth
didn't it that bad I mean it's like an
adrenaline rush with your meal it's like
eating a rubber band that is screaming
for its life inside of here yeah the
thing to remember is that even some
Asians find these foods not that great
occasion right here feels like people
aren't eating this stuff for sustenance
they're eating it for fun is so creepy I
think is also being raised with the idea
of recognizing where something comes
from you just take it from their
environment it's either really fresh or
it's just really dead Asia the people
who eat everything oh I haven't heard
from Barry in a while
open Barry's door and he looks exactly
like this and he smells like this and
