weird it sounds like a weird 80s health
food I don't trust it but I'll try it is
apparently made of malted barley the dog
food that really just tastes like milk
that's left over from an old bowl of
cereal
it tastes like dog food
this is Alan's races licorice and a
child on a thumb - not even a hook like
it's a thumbtack like whose final
decision was this packaging they're
shaped like little babies nope no these
are not pleasant
like a chocolate gummy bear that's
actually a naked child
it tastes like somebody said the word
chocolate in the next room
I feel like this is gonna be the jam and
they're also ruffles I like chicken I
like potato chips let's see what Evan I
don't know what I was expecting but it
was surprising that these taste like
chicken this is a scientific
breakthrough yeah through kind of
basically sour cream and onion a ranch
I can't even know these are pizza shapes
although they're not really shaped like
pizzas I really like the name shape very
descriptive that doesn't taste like
pizza every time I have these Pizza
flavors I always guy asked myself what
pizza are people eating cuz it never
ever tastes like a pizza I've ever had
just kind of vaguely tastes like oregano
this is really boring
I've heard tell of the legendary
Vegemite essential for brain function
that's good for vitality
hahahaha oh no you know no oh my god
oh that's Raph eyes Oh awesome
oh yeah oh I feel like I'm gonna
actually grow up that's the worst thing
I've ever dated
what the hell these tricked me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
