today we're calling cabs and ubers until
we find someone who isn't native to the
u.s. to tell us about their life and
take us to the restaurant in LA that
reminds them the most of home
we start with Hoover and while we wait
we ask our sound guy Chris a very
important question who do you like
better me or key the uber arrives and we
load in grief from for me rock while we
head to Echo Park we pitch him our idea
he's interested and has a great story
but doesn't have time this afternoon to
be in the video so we part ways it's
great talking about he was sneaking
across borders to get to America
essentially yeah he liked the food he
was describing I was like just come
on agree to it we call a cab using the
app curb his app it's terrible we take a
moment to appreciate the beauty of Echo
Park and we get in the next cab this
cabbie is literally the most crotchety
old man to ever drive a car he takes us
to Chinatown and we get out as quickly
as possible we decide to stretch our
legs before calling another uber during
our walk Henry finds a truck filled with
grapes and immediately gets a grape seed
stuck in his front teeth we call another
uber we get in and meet Thomas who
thinks we're making a student film
Thomas does not fit our specifications
but he was awesome all the same we
continued toward downtown and we passed
a building that sells ink copies storage
and waffles we get out stretch our legs
again and then we foolishly entered an
intersection without enough time to
cross running across the street we're
getting very hungry and a little bit
crazy about to call Hoover is it a Honda
Odyssey an odyssey is a good sort of
metaphor for what we're doing here the
uber arrives and we hop in hoping this
is the one where are you from Allah
I was born erasing he seems awesome so
we asked Abby wants to be a part of our
video absolutely I would love it well
how come you came to America huh that's
a really long story but no making sure I
came with my body conscious got married
19
I came here for the honeymoon
and then we decide stay for another
couple months but then my wife was
pregnant again you know we decide to
stay longer because the situation over
there was really getting worst don't
anger was part of Yugoslavia as you know
the war started in Slovenia and Croatia
Bosnia and then the whole region
fighting for almost ten years
and yes when you have war over there you
know never really decided to go back
especially with a little kid red so
that's how I decide to stay
the more we talked with him the more we
love Milan so to see if he's a true
Angelino I asked him one more important
question what's his favorite fast food
no I love in and out perfect we arrived
at a Roma cafe where Henry Chris and I
will eat Balkan food for the first time
Henry and Milan proceeded to order way
too much food and our waitress kindly
acts like it's normal
first we have kefir a milk and yogurt
drink Cheers
cheers guys it's really interesting it's
not sweet at all which other like it
just tastes like wholesome what do you
think of it Chris it's really tart bite
really liked it I prefer normal milk
kefir is normally paired with durak a
savory pastry effect on spanakopita
exactly yeah very very similar to Greek
I'll have more minute it's very simple
but very delicious
next up Sarma which is smoked ground
lamb with rice wrapped in cabbage and
grape leaves Wow
we don't have anything like the meat
tastes like really sure like a fatty
taste in the meat so much flavor it
tastes like I'm coming home for the
holidays yeah yeah I get that I can't
get enough of this you don't find many
dishes like this in other countries this
is typical Yugoslavian or Balkan food a
little bit of vegetables and then meat
and a bread bread is really common with
everything at one point in our feasting
Milan has to go take a call while we
continue to eat so much food whoa
I know she said it was lamb but it
tastes like bacon well I get with this
bread because the bread is made here
it's like the kind of bread I feel bad
making a sandwich with too because of
bread itself is like so delicious on his
own
this one's just a plate of meat I played
a meat on a bed of onion yeah like
pretty smoky which is really like I
guess I would never I didn't never even
thought that the Balkans had it on
cuisine which is super ignited it's like
smoky but then the the taste is a lot
like a gyro meat Milan comes back only
to let us know that he needs to get to a
meeting downtown so we say our goodbyes
and then we continue to demolish all the
food we order as well as Turkish coffee
with a piece of Turkish Delight a sugar
soaked and baklava stuff Apple this
sweet cake like pastry and baklava
oh man is it hot or no it's just no good
what the is happening this is candy
right now I feel like it could fight
like seven doctors at once it was time
to go we thanked our server and the
owner of aroma cafe and headed into our
last uber home the day was a success and
we'd like to thank Milan one more time
he helped us experience food that was
foreign to us after he spent 30 years
raising a family in a culture foreign to
him every driver has a story and today
we got to experience one
gonna say like that Milan is like the
coolest do that ever
he's so cool he's once he's as I wants
to talk about food which is what I want
to talk about yeah it's amazing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
