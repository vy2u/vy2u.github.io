we're calling cabs ubers and lyft's
hoping to find someone who isn't native
to the US to take us to the restaurant
in Los Angeles that reminds them the
most a pound we start our adventure with
lyft all right we have Ronald coming in
a Ford Edge but Ronald doesn't quite fit
our specifications and in Henry's words
that guy was a very bland white guy so
we call a cab company but while we're
waiting we hear someone calling out
Henry's name say my name
turns out we left some of our equipments
in the back of that bland white guy's
car and he's really more of a bland
white hero but back to the task at hand
our cab arrives and we meet Felix we
were wondering if we could interview you
but Felix wasn't into it so we call an
uber load into this guy's car I grab
some sweet footage of his belly we find
out he's from Chicago and we head back
to Hollywood to try for another taxi we
see our guy coming and we hope this is
the one I'm excited yeah what's that man
I'm Henry my name's shake
cool where are you from Louis Bangladesh
oh cool um how long you been in the
States for what we want to do is we'd
love to have you take us to the best
Bengali restaurant in Los Angeles and
show it to us and then just interview
you
it takes some more convincing but he
ends up going along with it why did you
come to America right yeah just some
money to survive
and you ever you ever go back to
Bangladesh every year you go back to see
your family why'd you guys pick out
what's your family come to LA because
this way that is like almost like really
is it this hot banger and smooth does
this it's more Hanukkah and as we
continue talking we learn a lot about
shake weight so you have been driving
cabs seven days a week 12 hours a day
and studying Jim to be a computer chair
and raise your feet your family yep
that's that's so much work it's crazy
how do you got the boot I guess so also
in his 15 years here he has become a
true Angelino because when we asked him
what his favorite fast-food chain was
you said you know nailed it
we arrived in little Bangladesh Sheikh
leads us into the restaurant where we're
going to try Bangladeshi food for the
first time
Shaikh picks out a few essential dishes
and we sit down to eat first up is Gopi
Rani
it's a dish with goat meat rice
vegetables and South Asian spices
it also comes as chicken but Sheikh
insisted on the goat scoop it and your
fingers and shove it in your mouth
please
really good no don't have a goat a lot
in case like Ram but more tender yeah I
have a goat before
that's always surprises his goat it
didn't taste it tastes like more beefy
Zoma it tastes like it's play pork
buttery it better say I have nothing
nothing else I say so it's amazing next
chicken roast a rich moist chicken with
a curry like spice to it
Sheikh said that this is normally a much
spicier dish in Bangladesh but they
toned it down here so more people can
enjoy it
the best chicken I've ever had sweet
bitches has like a little bit of like a
aged big Jewish very oily you could like
draw with it it's like a sweet curry
almost yeah I described it another
question am i only supposed to eat with
my right hand
yes sorry sorry
next up doll which was lentils dude with
beef shake said this is traditionally
eaten with the flour tortilla but this
restaurant didn't have any so we didn't
need it that way
oh this is so good this is so good about
in here it's like a beef shank it's
right up my alley this big ol piece of
bone brother yeah I give it ten hours
I'm just a Bangladeshi food and finally
Elish the national fish of Bangladesh
it's a type of herring but it's
typically not deboned so I call this
chapter Henry joke's on a lot of bones
there's burning it a lot of bones yeah a
lot of bones so watch out that is gonna
be stopped in your neck we have to get
out
what are the bumps around a head about
well there's a bone in there oh my god a
lot of bones on this with an indecision
what they're like razors so these sort
of like can get in your throat and you
can what don't desert oh I'm sorry I
think there's one more down in there you
got it I'm sorry I cannot like
everyone's okay you had a bone in your
throat that's so delicious but it's so
hard to eat on alright I think I'm full
after this we get up and walk around the
store snacking here and there until it
becomes evident that we're really no
longer welcome so we leave and the shake
drives us home were all way to stuff to
do much more talking but we couldn't
have asked for much more he already told
us all about his life and he took a
couple hours out of his day to help us
learn more about his culture after he
spent 15 years adjusting to ours every
cabbie has a story and today thanks to
shake we got to experience one sorry
because we're like everything is great
it's also good but it really is really
good it seems like we're not being
honest I've been in dozens of taste test
video time I was like oh there's at
least a couple gross things there's
nothing gross yeah you did almost die
and it almost died from choking that
wasn't great
he warned you he walked me and I'd still
almost died</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
