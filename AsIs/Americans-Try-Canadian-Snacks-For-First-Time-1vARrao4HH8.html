Joey is this what you trying to be
this guy's like there's some rules you
gotta know before you have Josh Lewis
like a Canadian ho-ho the gas station
food of Canada mine has very poor
presentation chocolate cake I mean I'm
gonna just shake it and it's raining
there's nice and moist and crumbly and
it's good a preservative it hasn't like
fake artificial hostess Twinkie
ding-dong
feeling dumb do you think Canadians
Browns Ho Hos hoo-hoos
are you cheating if I look and see
what's in it oh they're all chemicals
this is the most vague snack it starts
with a little sour flavor like hey
welcome to the party
fans the students in the cheese and then
you get a little barbecue yeah it's kind
of an adventure it should be called
barely barbecue
everyone thinks Canadians are bland and
you're proving it with your cheap game
right now like square diabetes when you
have free health care you can eat
whatever you want is so good
 this would taste fantastic effort
break up Canada's got fudge come on bye
these are adorable wow I've never tasted
a candy like this I don't know why that
is literally the sweetest thing I've
ever eaten
instantly melts into amazing creamy
maple sauce this is like nothing I've
ever had
I can literally fuel cavities like
forming in my teeth right now Connor if
you can blend it up and make a poutine
shake it has a really fancy name for
such like a lowbrow food this is a
saltiest thing I've ever eaten in my
life
I just tastes like decadence and sin
it's like if God was a potato this would
be a diarrhea mizzen brilliant it tastes
so much like drunk food that it's been
making me a little bit bright but it's
okay we just keep eating that's right
yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
