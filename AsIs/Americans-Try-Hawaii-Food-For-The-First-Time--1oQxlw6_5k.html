spam sushi I don't know why they gotta
get fancy for names I grew up eating
spam it what is spam
I feel like spam always gets like a bad
rep this looks like sushi a dad would
make don't trust this one bit very salty
I'm into this good kind of tasty I like
that I can do my blood pressure going up
I'm absolutely stunned by how edible
that is this is a very good drunk food I
can tell it's like fishy we needed a
ballpark this is loco moco which in
Spanish translates the crazy boogers
crazy booger and it kind of looks like
boogers that's a mean name for such a
beautiful thing sounds like the name of
a dog let's figure out why it's so loco
okay this sort of tastes like a prank I
bit into it thinking sausage and this is
definitely not solid there's something
sweet about this meat and I don't know
if that's a good thing this is like
every stoners dream come true kind of
wish it was like a big ass play adding
an egg to anything makes it better well
out more like wow wow this smells good
I've been waiting for the one that I'm
not going to enjoy and I think we've
we've reached it it smells like fish and
it looks like roadkill it looks like a
dead bird reminds me of a baby fetus I
once ate it kind of looks like prison
food maybe it's like a weird animal that
they only have in Hawaii you know what
it tastes like tobacco as it reminds me
of being 15 and trying chewing tobacco
for the first time and vomiting I could
you smoke this like is that like
something you could do with this is
edible but yeah no it's not not a
negative way but it's sort of like you
know when you accidentally fall on the
ground your face gets stirred in it and
then you go and eat like that I want to
like it but I just can't I don't like
the look of this one as much it doesn't
even want to go on the fork that's
telling me
one of you I like it good this tastes
like something your grandma would make
and you eat it just to be nice it tastes
like a Sunday afternoon there's a
simplicity to all these dishes that I
really appreciate and admire this is
like boiled meat and boiled cabbage yeah
have you had pork have you had cabbage
have you had rice you know what this
tastes like it's delicious I feel
tropical when I eat it it's just not
very exciting do that for him because I
get more it tastes like a super chilled
beach pork you know Hawaii keep on doing
you I'm having a great time eating this
and I hope everyone else does too
Hawaii is where it's at
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
