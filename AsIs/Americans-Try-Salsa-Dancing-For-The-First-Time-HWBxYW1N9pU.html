been listening to Beyonce all day to
prep for this I didn't know how else to
prepare I'm Daniela Dutton and I've been
teaching salsa now for about ten years
and I'm here today to teach new people
how to dance salsa
the biggest thing I would really love to
see people take out of today is getting
out of their comfort zone and being more
present I'm confident but I don't know
how I'm gonna do I'm confident I'm gonna
be horrible I think a lot of this is
just so sexy I think we just all have to
embrace our inner sexy it's just very
hard to out sexy Latin people you have
like all these white people or an Asian
person so right what's gonna go back
we're gonna go right replate come back
to middle we're gonna go black free
place back in the middle now every step
you take I want you guys to really make
sure you're actually shifting your
weight I really like salsa I don't think
I was there and she was fire and I was
just sort of like inspiring her to like
feeding my anime towards you yeah it was
cool you don't feel that in a lot of
dances yeah I usually just feel like to
fight or just going like we're going
left right left keep dancing basic and
what's what's gonna go back no come back
all right all right right you said no
it's okay good job right unlike most
dancing where I feel like I forget the
steps really easily I felt like I could
remember all the steps yeah well she
added to it I wasn't anxious that she
was adding more so nice and slow
altogether
ready same thing ready hand goes out and
up now ladies right turn way to go keep
dancing so your basic is happening while
you're leading this turn I wouldn't do
this again I think it's you know it's
really fun to just kind of like once you
like start to kind of loosen up a little
bit and I got a hint of that I'm not
saying I was loose quite like once he's
kind of start to like feel a little bit
more it's like oh I could I could get
into this you guys ready to try it on
your own yeah come on yeah
I think you ready I think you're ready
you don't have to be good at it to have
fun doing it like there's some sports
where it's like you know golf like it
sucks if you're not great at call but
salsa dancing I think is fun if you're
even even if you're not gonna but then
the better you get the more fun you're
having so as you can see I've drenched
in sweat right now which obviously means
it was phenomenal once you get into it
you kind of stop thinking about it which
was really awesome I think it's
interesting to remember that partner
dancing was the only way you danced for
a really long time so getting into the
partnering spirit is like really great
it feels like natural I don't feel like
I was as bad as I thought I was going to
be yeah it just feels very intuitive I
mean like that was also an interesting
thing about it it's like you know they
tell you a new move and you're like oh
how am I gonna
I have to figure out how to add this
thing and like you're one to put like
the moment you stop fighting it it's
like oh yeah this is how my body would
naturally move into this position and
then it would just flow I'm ready to be
in dirty dancing now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
