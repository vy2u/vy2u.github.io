without Hall pieces I think this might
be a ha
it smells like cherries dipped in
vinegar it's really sugary it is very
sugar yeah these are good I like this
taste fine
the smell is unreal I'm good today I'm
gonna remember her more than the
coffee's agreed
it looks like it's spicy and squid
flavoured look like puffed tentacles
like we'd have puffed corn in America
cheers Cheers that's pretty good
well I have no I don't really get squid
flavor from them it's kind of like I
think I know it's with flavor would be
yeah um like a spicy cheeto I just lost
my appetite
that's what they are before this you
know red melon seeds announcer its it is
hot dude dude what's in red melon I
never had right now yeah they don't
taste like anything at all huh oh look
sound like you broke our tooth their
melon seeds dyed red no huh the seed
isn't good it's not good nothing good
just give me a sunflower seed it's just
a boring seed like all seeds
chicken on a sing he it's like a reward
creating all those other foods it snows
so hungry
looks like some sort of street food I
meant for really good was this Bilitis
that is incredible
I can't they make ships they taste like
this where's their chicken satay chips
we should put more things on sticks why
do people like stuff on sticks the
phallic nature of it I really think that
Americans need to up their sauce game
