yeah I don't know what North Korea I
guess North Korea has enough drama on
its own I don't know maybe there will be
some dance numbers I expect what I see
in the music videos just without the
music things are kind of amped up a
little bit I literally didn't even know
this was a thing
so this school is super super posh this
school is chosen for the sons and
daughters of God did I hit the heck
right so if you don't go to this school
you're a piece I don't approve of any of
this all these guys in sport coats are
just taken down the one dude in a
sweatshirt so we know who to root for
beat the crap out of him it's just now
we're the teachers you know run now we
have a girl riding a bike and she's got
this ingenious dry-cleaning hanger on
the back of her bike I need that setup
she's a peasant she seems like a girl we
could all identify with they're gonna
run into each other and fall in love
better to burn out than to fade away
Kurt Cobain good to know Kurt Cobain
exerts such a strong influence on Korean
media okay I like it now this one guys
straight-up got like Busta Rhymes here
guys we've got the most preposterous wig
of dreadlocks all right it could be 2070
or 1983 I feel like I'm having a good
time when I'm watching these guys
somebody worked hard stacking those
cardboard boxes there one friend is dead
summing things up from afar go to your
friend make sure he's okay I'd be
surprised if this guy didn't die hmm he
would have heard himself really bad this
reminds me of when the Jonas Brothers
had a TV show they just had more fun
than I've ever had in my entire life
so you name these things just by
spinning a wheel of words
I loved the name coffee prince because I
consider myself kind of coffee prince oh
there oh they're racing oh yeah now
we're driving around he's like a little
kid well he think it would be okay to
coming to the bath house like that
no she is a girl give her her money no
you're a guy oh jeez that's so mean
bathing and showering with a bunch of
other naked women you're like guys let's
get some noodles a little Milan
situation going on
who is this guy is he the coffee Prince
I miss you so much to my eyeballs are
about to pop out I say that all the time
oh he knows he looks good guys like a
Korean Patrick Bateman he's assigned to
his mom like this sort of like flirting
with her over the phone she works in a
coffee plant and he's wealthy what kind
of nice Sun is this
it did not reflect what I thought it
would be but I liked them it really
seems to like hang on one element of a
story for a good length of time like the
plots are crazy I mean it's kind of
reminded me of like the energies like of
a Nickelodeon show or something like
real like fun always on the flowers
seemed interesting I definitely keep
watching that the only thing that could
get Americans excited about drama is
murder but they've found other things
that really South Korean audiences like
here's the thing I'm like making fun of
it but I could totally see myself after
like five episodes being like haha this
is so dumb as I'm like riveted yeah
there it again the perfect error I would
just kill for that hair constantly
constantly pushed by the wind yet
there's no wind but it always looks like</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
