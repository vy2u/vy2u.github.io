was teaching computers teaching math
that's right if that means she's a
little smarter but the man that was
sitting on a good for women that must
sit together listen pretty good-looking
women sitting over there I was teaching
in Chicago but I have a background and
acting I went to the studio and I like
walk in and he like things around in the
chair and he just had this smile and I
dropped so many hints that I was like
into his like we went into the booth and
I like touched his fat you know like oh
thank you and he wasn't picking up on
any other thing I didn't tell them to
take my number in those how do you push
through those times when like you don't
see I don't hold back anything be honest
and let the person know how you feel
that let that person know how much he or
she means to you something that was like
we're trying to balance out and figure
out now is how you maintain your own
unique identity while still remaining
partners we just respect each other's
space we know that we want time for our
selves stone we a lot of times I'm fine
I also think it's about knowing who you
are and what your goals are
all about so do you guys have kids yet
we're trying to balance this like
encouragement from family to like get
ready to go into that space but we're
not ready for that we really want to be
in a place where like mentally and
financially and I feel that you know you
can make your own decision of coaching
but it's the kind of thing where if you
think if you're waiting on the financial
part there's a a slight possibility that
you might say I'm never ready how do you
remind yourself that it's worth it I
remember some of the Dodos that I hate
it and you say I do it is supposed to be
for life it's worth it because in the
first place you think about how much you
really care for this person how much
this person needs you I'm a human
you need that particular person what can
you live with what can you believe
without and you ask yourself do I really
need this you know like do I have to
have this am i you want to have my way
is it is it worth going through all this
fighting is it worth going through a
divorce and starting over again and all
and all that stuff and most the time the
answers gonna be no you guys have
provided us with like so many tools for
when it you know does get really
difficult because I think even three
years in we're still just like I mean
you look at 14 years and three years
you're like oh you guys I've got letters
I but it has been like nice to sit down
and talk with you guys thank you so much
I'm glad we could provide some
assistance in the glass India taxes
wisdom can we text you guys if we have
any money
of course she's really
I only do it with one finger that's nice
this we have patients</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
