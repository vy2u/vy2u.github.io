there's an invasion coming remember stop
it this scene is ridiculous oh come on
you think a guy can just give one sultry
look and then suddenly be inside someone
I'm fast but I'm not that fast no other
things you should know about me before
we have sex do not touch my armpits I
hate being tickled
deal I hate cheek laughs anyway okay you
go it's my apartment but okay no no no
no no tell me what you like
I like compliments
you're a good kisser Thanks you're not
terrible tell me what you hate people
who talk during movies and you're gonna
miss the part where you find out that
John was an alien all along
wait really wow I just don't like
deceptive sex like that I dread to just
do it and not think about it well don't
you think that people should talk about
yeah animals have sex all the time and
they don't talk about it after all right
I give up we'll be dolphins for the rest
of the night stay back
I do need you to be a hero right now we
could be alive
I've never had an orgasm ever ever not
even by yourself
correct have you tried yet I didn't even
say anything you know but I've tried
everything
wait what about the other night in the
car
I made some sounds but you didn't ask
what they meant okay you're freaking out
me yeah because something I thought
happened didn't happen I'm still a
person
I still get turned on I love making
other people feel good don't you get
pleasure out of making other people
freak - yeah yeah I do that's my
favorite part
and that's the problem I won't be able
to experience that with you
my inability to orgasm has nothing to do
with you but it does how in addition to
me not being able to experience the
number one human sensation I now also
have to feel guilty about worsening your
experience if we ever have sex been
there done that
no way I can see why you don't like
talking about this I never should have
said anything
no I'm glad you did you should be honest
with me Oh what
how does my being honest help now you're
repulsed by the idea of us having sex
because you can't feel like a man
without getting me off you're totally
overreacting so are you I just I don't
want to feel like I'm taking advantage
of you I am a big girl Nathan I'm not
gonna do anything that I don't want to
do and thank you for a nice night
wait wait no Kate come on Kate come on
the movie isn't even over everybody dies
at the end that can't be true the leads
are too good-looking let's see this
thing through
these won't know what hit
we took did you feel that
a little bit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
