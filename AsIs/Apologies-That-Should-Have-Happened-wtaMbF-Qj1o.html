that I've been meaning to get off my
chest for decades now so in high school
in gym class whatever I didn't want to
swim and I had a male gym teacher I
would just tell him I was on my period
because he would get so uncomfortable
and he wouldn't make me swim so to my
gym teacher from ninth grade I'm really
sorry that you thought I had my period
for three weeks in a row Courtney from
fourth grade I apologize for hitting you
in the head with a book though they only
captured one corporate I was the other
book on the other side of your face I
just want to take this moment to say
from the bottom of my heart I'm sorry I
am really sorry - Brittney Crisler in
middle school for throwing trash at you
and saying that I was throwing way too
trash I did I feel so bad because you
actually turn out to be a really nice
person and you're married I think you
have a kid maybe in Australia I don't
know hi mom hi dad
I'm sorry for using your internet to
watch porn men have needs to wheedle
Yankovic I am sorry that in middle
school I pretended not to like your
music in order to fit in you're the best
and I don't know why I had to pretend I
was someone I wasn't just to try to fit
in that was dumb and I'm sorry that's on
me weird mom and dad I'm super sorry for
sneaking out through like all of high
school I know you knew that I did it but
just so we're clear I'm sorry but I have
a really good
to all my teachers in high school I'd
like to firmly apologize we're sleeping
in all of your classes I figured out
that if I do this pose right here it
looks like I'm thinking really hard but
really I was just hiding the fact that I
was sleeping sorry I manipulated the
system
please take this heartfelt apology
series grant Williams from third grade
Southie old school I am sorry that I bit
you - I got a little out of hand it was
a primal instinct but to be fair you
started it
I'm really sorry we need to know about
it until now

I was reprimanded so hard</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
