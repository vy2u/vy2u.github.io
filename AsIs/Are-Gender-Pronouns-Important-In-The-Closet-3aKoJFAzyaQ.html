ahead girls she had inner-city drinking
marks having a good time
hi everybody welcome to in the closet my
friend rain is here and she's gonna come
into the closet right about now hi
welcome
I'm rain Valdez what I'm like a actress
writer director aspiring are these all
your clothes mm-hmm love thank you I
might borrow this one you actually can
so we're here to talk about pronouns we
are my preferred pronouns are she and
her and yeah I identify as a woman who
happens to be trans I feel like it's
very apropos that I'm in the closet with
a unicorn
saying what are the pronouns mean to you
pronouns for me has always been very
very important it's allowed me to live
growing up and being trans I was I felt
like I was constantly being misgendered
you identify as she and her what if
somebody was all of a sudden was like
look at that dude or he or him like went
like how would that make you feel like
they didn't yeah they don't get it yeah
like they don't yeah like huh you don't
see me then yeah yeah yeah I haven't had
to think about my pronouns in like a
serious or like life-affirming context
if you really change a person's life
especially a person of trans experience
just by being supportive and being aware
of what's important to them in terms of
how they want to be addressed the
entertainment industry is like not the
kindest place to any minority know how
much faith do you have in human humanity
yeah we're what hope level God are you a
train I just think that we were do but
you know I think it's getting better
being
asian-american trans actress felt like I
was going to be limiting myself but
thankfully the world's changing there
are more opportunities that I'm creating
for myself I write I asked I direct just
being in a space where I can fully be me
and not have to worry about whether you
know I I need to tell someone or or what
if so-and-so finds out and you know I
don't have to worry about that anymore
which is kind of everybody free and yeah
I'm much more inspired to be the
filmmaker that I want to be rain thank
you so much for coming into the closet
