(cheerful pop music)
Um, thank you?
- Anyone have any
recommendations for hangovers?
- Advil.
Okay.
Sleep it off.
Now you're telling me to get out of bed?
Oh, that's a little cynical.
- Am I a lesbian?
- No, no I am not, but thank you.
Lesbians are great.
- Love it if we could
get some more people.
Much love.
(upbeat electronic music)
Gotta get a little more comfortable
if we're gonna be dancing.
We got the whip, and
then you put your arm up
and you nay nay.
(giggles)
- Hello.
(upbeat electronic music)
(electronic beeping)
- I do this move all the time.
It's like my go-to, I'm like at a club,
and I'm jammin' and I'm like--
- Go for it, that was so
much faster than I thought.
This next is these.
Oh we bopped again.
This is my bop, this
is all I got, love it.
(light jazz music)
(electronic beeping)
Just gonna enjoy this time.
How's your day?
- It's hard to be a man on Periscope.
(laughs)
The struggles are real.
(poppy jazz music)
- Here, see, I match.
(upbeat pop music)
- I wouldn't necessarily
call it surprising,
I would call it interesting.
- Being a guy on Periscope,
like, the difference
is very severe and you just gotta know
there's nothing you can do.
- I just thought it was
funny because you just have
some girl, doesn't matter
who it is, she's standing
there, she will get so many more eyes.
- People tuned in and
they didn't even click off
of her when they realized that
she wasn't doing anything.
- I didn't have to say anything
interesting, I didn't have
to do anything to get
attention, which kind of negates
that I have a brain.
Would I livestream again?
Prolly not.
- I thought I was really funny,
I thought I was giving a performance.
I could be just like
butt ass naked right now
and no one would care.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
