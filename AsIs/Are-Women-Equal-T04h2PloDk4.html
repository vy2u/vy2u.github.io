ratified equal rights for women this
1970s 42 40 44 early 70s I believe
somewhere in the 1920s do you think
women are equal in the United States no
it's not I do yes I know a lot of women
who feel equal no no no it's not it's
not close
what amendment states that equality of
rights under the law shall not be denied
or abridged by the United States or by
any State on account of sex I believe
that's a Fourth Amendment experiment say
this is a 25th amendment what if I told
you that we never passed that amendment
Iran really no you can't I'm not
surprised
do you think we should have that in the
Constitution I don't think it's required
I think I think it's very important I
think you guys are gonna gain something
I think you're gonna lose something I
think it's like a devil's dagger so so
basically there's no help it's a
lose-lose situation and we're all going
to become and mates eventually basically
so all of this talk about ratifying
equal rights pretty much narrows down to
one thing the Equal Rights Amendment its
amendment to the Constitution that was
first introduced in 1923 by Alice Paul
shortly after women got the right to
vote it called for women's equality
stating that equality of rights under
the law shall not be denied or abridged
by the United States or by any State on
account of sex it failed at the time but
was introduced again and then kept
getting introduced into Congress now
it's been introduced in every single
congressional session since 1982 I mean
that's crazy
the ER a is like you're really needy
ex-boyfriend Steve who texts you every
six months just to see how your mom is
doing we know that's not what it's about
Steve and maybe the ER a like Steve
should just accept it's failure and move
on I mean women are already equal
according to that guy so maybe this is
just a bunch of ladies you've watched a
little too much Handmaid's Tale and I've
nothing better to do to set this
straight I decided to talk to some
professionals to see why the ER is so
important so women are already equal
well that's it that's a complex question
are women equal in the eyes of the law
no are women equal inherently yes our
research would show that most people
think that we're already guaranteed
equal rights actually eighty percent of
people and they're made aware that we're
not and asked if they would support an
amendment to guarantee those rights
actually 94 percent of people say they
would so despite all of the discord that
we have in America right now people of
every demographic appear that they would
support this the problem is is that
people don't know that we're not
guaranteed these rights and most people
under 35 at least have never heard of
the Equal Rights Amendment what are some
examples of how women aren't equal well
there's the legal things like pay and
the level of legal scrutiny when they go
into courts with the gender
discrimination case workplace
discrimination pregnancy discrimination
in the workplace domestic abuse and
violence and where women just don't have
the same legal recourse I couldn't help
but notice that we were all white women
is this like the early feminism of 1923
an amendment that only works for white
women while ignoring women of
I wanted to find someone who'd be able
to answer this so I got in touch with
Carol Jenkins an emmy-winning journalist
and a founding president of the Women's
Media Center you know of course I'm over
of color so I know many women of color
who feel that the e re and nothing to do
with that but I come from a feminist
family one of the reasons that I am
there and I take my granddaughter with
me lobbying on Capitol Hill so the bills
that are before Congress is that women
of color need it more desperately than
anyone else quite frankly to make sure
that those numbers and pay differences
and in access to education and
employment you know women are still
discriminated against because of the
color of their skin so you know I would
say that this er a what we're fighting
for now includes everyone it includes
people with different tastes and
disability of sexual orientations that
we were working for the inclusion of
everyone in America so it turns out that
women aren't totally free under US law
and that women of color are affected by
this the most in fact there's a ton of
bills introduced every year that attempt
to limit the freedom that women have
over their bodies in 2017 the House
passed the American Health Care Act
which ended Medicaid funding for Planned
Parenthood in 2011 there were 92
provisions across 24 states that aimed
to restrict abortion access in July of
2016 the House Appropriations Committee
passed a bill that eliminated funding
for family planning services which
included things like breast exams birth
control and pap tests I could go on
government continuously introduces and
passes legislation that attempts to
limit women's bodily autonomy but why
can't they pass the ER a this was a
question for a lawmaker so I decided to
reach out to ted Lieu a california
congressman who supports the e ra and
who also has really good tweets I've
represented 33 congressional district in
Southern California I'm a huge supporter
of the Equal Rights Amendment very
honored to write an op-ed with Patricia
Arquette on the Equal Rights Amendment I
do everything I can to make sure that we
have equal pay
or equal work most people I've talked to
you agree that women are equal or women
should be equal and in your op-ed you
said that Americans overwhelmingly
support ratification of the ER a and not
many people even realize that the ERI
hasn't been ratified if there's so much
support for it why can't it pass in
Congress that's a great question my
first thought is that they're not
rational but there are some people who
will not vote for it because they think
it's una razón and too many lawsuits so
that's sort of their complaint that I
hear from folks who don't want to vote
for it so my response to that is that
it's a fear of too much justice if there
are pay gaps and people are suing to
correct that problem then to me that is
something we want to encourage 500
billion dollars a year is how much
economists estimate that women lose an
economy because of this disparity in the
wage gap so would you say that women's
rights women's issues our economic
issues absolutely and it is harming
women economically it is flat-out unfair
and it's time that Congress passes the
URA why is gender equality a partisan
issue so what happens is the Speaker of
the House Paul Ryan has not agreed to
put it up for a vote and basically their
party controlling the House of
Representatives get to control their
agenda and this is simply not on the
agenda of the current party controlling
the house after speaking with ted Lieu I
wanted to talk to somebody who opposed
the e ra I contacted congressman Duncan
Hunter Nevada State Senator Becky Harris
Nevada Assemblywoman Robin Titus and
Maine State Senator at Lisa keen
none of them agreed to speak with me but
I did get in touch with Arlene Cole
she's the president of Eagle forums
California branch
it's an organization founded by Phyllis
Schlafly arguably the most infamous
opposer of the e ra in its history for
Orlean it seemed like the biggest issues
with the e ra were abortion rates it
would grant and that she herself already
felt equal and that women didn't need
more rights I looked more into Schlafly
x' work and I found a 2007 op-ed she
wrote for the LA Times it stated that
while claiming to benefit women the ER I
would actually have taken away some of
women's rights the amendment would
women to be drafted into military combat
abolish the presumption that the husband
should support his wife and take away
Social Security benefits for wives and
widows it would also give federal courts
in the federal government enormous new
powers to reinterpret every law that
makes a distinction based on gender such
as those related to marriage divorce and
alimony how would a supporter of the ER
a respond to this criticism that it
might actually hurt women and families I
decided to call back Carol Jenkins to
find out you know Phyllis Schlafly had a
great deal of success whipping up this
anti woman spirit when she herself led a
very independent free access for life I
think a lot of the arguments are moved
now women feel that they can participate
in the military and they do I think to
put any kind of a limit on the
capability of women is to make every
girl in America feel less than
diminished I think that as women and as
men we need to feel we can support
ourselves we don't have to rely on our
husbands salary you know it's given the
opportunity to get an education and to
participate wholly so what can the
average person do who just learned about
this and you know wants to ratify Equal
Rights so in addition to calling them
members of Congress as well as US
senators they can write letters to the
editor they can do social media that's
free they can try to write an op-ed for
newspapers just get their voices heard
and to amplify their voices and then to
join different organizations that
support the Equal Rights Amendment it's
just really an awareness issue and women
can't do this alone this is a fight for
everyone this is not just a woman issue
this is an American issue
it passed in the air a is something that
seems important to you get in touch with
your legislators and urge them to
prioritize this bill tweet Instagram
whatever and help spread awareness that
women are still not granted equal rights
under US law and if you don't support
ratifying the air I thank you for
watching this song
I mean sincerely I'm impressed that
you've stayed and watched this long I
mean there's so many other things you
could watch and so many other things
that like are in line with your own up
so it's cool that you've watched this
whole thing and you know maybe you
didn't change your mind and that's fine
I mean you're you you do you you know is
there can we get that light back on
coming get excute tad
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
