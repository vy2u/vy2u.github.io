bar the first one says I'll have some
h2o
the second says I'll have some h2o to
the second chemist dies a logicians wife
is having a baby the doctor hands the
newborn to the dad the wife asks is it a
boy or a girl
the logician replies yes there are only
two hard things in computer science
caching validation naming things and
off-by-one errors how do you tell the
difference between a chemist and plumber
ask them to pronounce this word helium
walks into a bar and orders of beer the
bartender says sorry we don't serve
noble gases here he doesn't react
entropy isn't what it used to be did you
hear about the chemist who got cooled to
absolute zero he's okay now
have you heard of the band called 10:20
three megabytes of course not
they haven't had any gigs yet Roman
walks into a bar and orders a Martinez
you mean martini the bartender asks the

would have asked for it two kittens on a
sloped roof which one slides off first
the one with the lowest knew a
