great
hi I'm Sarah and the last time you saw
me behind this desk
I was challenging beauty lover Nina to a
makeup competition this might have gone
off the rails that's what I like to hear
I won that competition sorry Nina and
now I've moved on to my next opponent
jazz hello whoever wins this round will
move on to the next to face a new
opponent and the winner will be chosen
by you the audience oh it has to be a
creative look it can't just be a normal
going out look it has to cover 40% of
your face and it's gonna be inspired by
a theme that we are going to pull out of
my magic Tupperware romance oh I'm here
for romance it's abstract it can mean a
lot of things honestly I don't really
know what I'm gonna do but it's gonna be
pink probably you know I'm also like
very single and you're very in a
relationship going
really into it but my immediately jumps
to hearts and then the Joker playing
card and I'm gonna use that as the
inspiration for my look today so for my
look I'm going to be using the colors
red and black because those are the
first two colors I think of when I think
of romance messed this up already I went
to big you know I flew close too close
to the Sun whenever I let makeup I like
watch TV so it's really weird I'll just
pretend to be yeah I watching orange is
the new black right now so if you could
bang made it look like a sickly clown
thank you thank you can I see yours
wait we've got sequins on I
I don't know what I did I truly don't
know what I did but I'm here for it I
think it looks good I think you're just
very wearable but I love the half
colored lips
thank you it's very striking let's get
some opinions around the office first
just to see just to see jazz used
glittery sparkly things and I think that
jazz is a little more connected to like
where you'd put makeup you know like you
could like eyeliner and then you put it
here and everything like that I think
yours is very like I mean it's like art
on your face honestly you think you like
Jasmin's better I think it just feels
like more like less holiday yeah they
look great thank you
oh that's very romantic I love the color
palette is Sarah Fraher hi
do you want to hear my funny tagline I
said I'm a clown of love because love
makes everyone a fool such contrasting
looks but if I had to like choose one
over the other sorry
that's fun so we got some responses yeah
I am eager to see what the audience
thinks however me too honestly we're
both rocking different vibes it's really
I think it's gonna be pretty like what
people prefer yeah it's gonna be all up
with a personal preference yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
