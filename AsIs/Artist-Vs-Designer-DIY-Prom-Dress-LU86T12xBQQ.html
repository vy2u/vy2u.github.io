home fashion actually used to work in
fashion before I started here at
BuzzFeed I went to finem graduated as a
designer and then I went on to work for
Jeremy Scott who is the creative
director at mosquito now and then had my
own line and I would show in LA Fashion
Week and I would make all my own stuff
from scratch I am a long time crafter
and a long time watcher of Project
Runway and I have no other experience
making clothes whatsoever so I think
I'll do great yes okay okay that's a
good spread can I use that so far boy
Lange floor-length okay oh wow that's a
lot somewhat form without see that's
where I'm like oh man okay two and a
half hours okay
how much so for my dress I want to do
something that's David Bowie inspired
but with a little Lady Gaga in it when I
saw the flowers I immediately knew that
that's where I wanted to go can I make
something kind of halfway cool with the
materials that we were given I feel like
the person would wear my address is
someone who of course like doesn't give
up
someone who marches to their own drum
beat is that I used to say the kind of
person who would wear my dress is like
just a total badass you know how many
problems I went to when I was in high
school I went to a total of six proms so
I just bought one suit and literally
just wear the same suit to everything
there was one prom I went to and it
sucked terrible there was no dancing I
was like like you know like a lonely
insecure horny teenager I just wanted to
dance with boys
am i making something nice or am I just
gonna glue everything on the table on
and not that that's that your game okay
cuz we can do that I can start gluing
you and I mean setting myself for a lot
of glue gun burns should I be nervous
now I just want to put everything on but
I know that's a bad idea
if I had more time to like really refine
it I better check you make this look
really dope because I'm not mad at this
RIT but we got this we got yeah we can
do it can make it work
making what if you all have Heidi Klum
waiting here yeah freak I'm just going
to be like take me home with you of
hiding 15 min flat 15 mins
this was really fun I had no idea where
I was going with this it is what it is
we made a dress out of things we found
so if anybody knows fashion at all
they'll know that this is beautiful this
was a lot of fun
I kind of like lost track of time
and now some of our co-workers are gonna
come in and decide which of us made the
best dress I feel like I'm gonna get
some coffee today I can taste some
coffee in the air a Starbucks card this
is insane
these are incredible this one looks like
really awesome eighties vibe
this one definitely is way more edgy and
crafty and like space this one has a lot
of imagination to it love you love curly
but if I was going to prom I don't know
Donna yes yeah um it's giving me like
Lady gaga oh yes what would curly want
to be in for a gram that dress yeah
there's a bow so this one is definitely
more like I love nature and I'm just
like effortlessly cool as it's prom this
one is a little bit more like elegant to
me I want to try that one yeah you can
have that one and I'll take this one
this one's just more my vibe I don't
like nature so I'm gonna go with this
one
I gotta go with this one I think I'd
wear this one you know my ass would show
off in something like this all the years
of crafting really paid off and we paid
off good job Maggie yes you owe me
coffee girl let's go get coffee yeah all
right bye guys
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
