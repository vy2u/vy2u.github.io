bad about yourself
especially when you don't have anything
to feel bad about there are people that
internalize the message that Asian
people don't belong that don't belong
somewhere then tell other Asian
Americans that their dreams are stupid
it's less about I think big moments and
more about like little moments in which
people don't realize that they're doing
or saying something that points a big
metaphorical finger at your face since
middle school probably the most common
thing I've heard is those jokes about
you're an Asian you must have a small
penis because that's funny
here's what I have to say to that you're
not gonna see my penis so it doesn't
matter when I decided to make the career
change from being a programmer to being
an entertainment someone very close to
me said that I had absolutely no chance
of succeeding because there are no
Asians in entertainment if I were to see
the person that said that to me I would
say and yet Here I am
so when I was three or four my mom was
teaching me or two though and my nursery
school teachers called her and told her
to stop teaching me because they thought
it was interfering with me learning
English if I had the opportunity to talk
to those nursery school teachers now I
would definitely tell them that they
were wrong you could be bilingual and be
American one time I was listening to
Taylor Swift in a car and a friend of
mine said that Taylor Swift would be
beautiful if she didn't have a jean eyes
if I could see that friend now I'd say
you're an idiot
two years ago I was at a football game
and his USC fan comes up to me and says
hey man can you do my math homework for
me and uh I was kind of in shock didn't
really know how to respond to that
because you don't really expect anyone
like go there joke's on him I'm bad at
math in high school I opened up my
lunchbox and pulled out a fork and a
knife
um kid said to me oh you with a fork and
knife
I thought Indians only ate with their
hands because everyone in India is poor
at the time I think I was just kind of
taken aback and I didn't really say
anything if I could say something to him
I would say I hope you've learned a lot
more about the world since then and have
fun eating with your hands candy it's
scary because I know that this doesn't
apply to just me when I was younger I
used to try really hard to fit in and to
hide the Indian part of me I would
really urge younger people not to do
that what does matter is my validation
to myself open your eyes man the world
is full of possibilities</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
