ten
it sucks when my grandmother speaks
Hindi and to my dad and I have no idea
what they're saying as I grew up I sort
of didn't want to learn quite as much
since it didn't really apply to the
world outside of my house I refused to
speak it because everyone around me was
not Korean so I told my mom if you don't
speak to me in Korean I don't want to
talk to you the daily stuff like getting
through school doing extracurriculars
keeping grades up unfortunately has been
a higher priority in my life for
survival and the language I should know
but the what but or but the what the
would oh my god my father be so
disappointed in them that I can't even
say I'm sorry
like my mom dad family chums front line
yet does the tough hate to say I feel
like each generation after me our
culture is going to dive down because I
could be able to speak loud so how can I
teach them to teach their kids
Cory Cole thought Oh koto I think I
never said I start I'm sorry before this
Fargo High agen families are known for
not expressing this as often as they
should I say this to my mom a lot now
because we're on opposite coasts
i'm sanna he oh I wish I could speak
Tagalog to my grandparents there's this
language barrier and it keeps them
understanding how I'm growing up here in
America and it keeps me from
understanding how their lives unfolded
in the philippines sauna eb milk
malarkey more a cool like that
if I could say something to my
grandparents in Japanese I'd say thank
you so much for working so hard and
being positive because we feel that
passed down to each generation but for
now I will say arigato gozaimashita
Kevon watch out ja poom Jane I talk boy
I never heard of those hey I don't even
know those last words I just said my mom
I won't I want to tell her like I hope
you're like proud of me I'm doing better
than that did before and my parents
would you have mu J Asha hai ki aapke
much Bart Garvey so when my grandma was
about to pass away she had major
dementia one of the things that would
bring her back to us was when we would
speak Japanese to her and going back
through those nursery rhymes that was
one of the few things I could fully
communicate with her when I would sing
it
oh man I'm a hooter Hooda psych uh yeah
that's when like her eyes would click
and we could just have a connection of
her being there in her last in her last
days to my grandmother
