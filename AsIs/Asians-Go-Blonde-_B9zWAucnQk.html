more rebellious and go full blinds but
I've always been told that you shouldn't
do it because I'm Asian going full
fulbright it just felt like unnatural to
me
I grew up you know such a conservative
countryside in Korea never thought about
it I guess so recently I lost someone
who was really important my life and I
thought why not start this new chapter
with a new look I used to work as a
floor model for this clothing company
and they really advertised being natural
and azure came in and told me that I had
to rebuy my hair black because the light
brown hair was natural for me most
importantly it requires too much money
and time cannot really afford to go
blonde and then go to the salon every
two weeks - root touch-up today I want
to see how that looks if it really looks
unnatural or if I can pull it off by
black hair hi my name is Tiffany Lee and
I'm a celebrity makeup and hair artist I
have a studio called Studio tighly today
I'm gonna bleach heaven
YV and Claire's hair blonde for the
first time hair that's darker especially
Asian hair is very resistant to go light
so it takes multiple processes to get
blonde which takes about seven eight
nine different levels to get that color
I use a bleach that had a blue undertone
in it as well as a developer that had a
violet undertone to create that icy
blonde and then I use a color shampoo
which is has purple additive to become a
cooler blonde we put another hair
treatment to keep the integrity of the
hair after that ready to sell out the
clients hair
this is my hair holy crap I'm someone
wow I look like a different reason it
was such a change I look so different
now I like the change I think I'm gonna
keep this hair for a while I like
experimenting with it now that have the
opportunity to do so
and who knows maybe I'm gonna dye my
hair a different color next oh my god
how many hours nine hours
I definitely feel more confident now I
feel like I could go lighter even if you
look like really fast - I'm surprised my
hair has been dead for years
all of them weren't sure what the
results were gonna turn out today when
they saw their final results they were
all really happy that their hair was
still there and the color was what they
expected and their hair still felt like
hair which is the most important thing
from this experience Asians can look
natural I mean maybe it's not their
natural born hair color but I think they
can look as natural and good as any
other people can I think everyone should
be able to experiment with blonde hair
or even any other color hair really</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
