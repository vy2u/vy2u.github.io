hmm I don't know that it's easy for
anybody to be a stripper those men and
women are heroes
what is the stupidest insult you've ever
received because you're a lesbian you
look like a woman who doesn't sleep with
men yep why do you have to differentiate
between being gay and being lesbian he's
being gay the same as being lesbian well
gay is an umbrella term for homosexual
person and then a lesbian is like and
under there's like a homosexual woman
you know it's like that math thing where
like squares are rectangles but
rectangles aren't necessarily squares
just like that one has a penis what is
the one thing you wish straight people
would understand about you well not just
about me but queer people in general you
know we made enormous strides in terms
of equality but there are still people
who lose housing jobs and their lives
because of their sexuality the person
they happen to be so we're not done and
we need your help what is your reaction
when a man says he can turn you straight
I get very worried for the other women
in his life
Zach as a terrible listener is it
awkward when a guy hits on you more sad
for a little buddy
do you think it's harder to come out as
a lesbian or do you think it's harder to
come out as gay um the same do you ever
get sick of people asking questions like
you're not just a normal human being
yes but I'm also hoping to answer some
of these questions like all in bulk via
these videos so you can stop asking me
these questions at dinner parties or the
grocery store I'm just here to buy
vegetarian chicken do you hang out with
guys more or with girls I'm a stand-up
comics hang out with dudes a lot but I
also have two sisters so they're my best
friends none of this has anything to do
with me being gay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
