the individual does not experience
sexual attraction heterosexuality is
attraction to opposite gender
homosexuality is attraction to the same
gender I'm not interested in having
sexual contact with a male or female or
any gender a sexuality is very much not
the same thing as being celibate
celibacy is a choice planning for the
future for someone that you want to save
yourself for asexuality is a sexual
orientation and therefore not a choice
no I have not experienced arousal to
date some asexual people definitely
experience physiological arousal just
like everybody else
people have varying levels of libido I
mean my nipples get hard if it's cold
out but not sexually just because they
don't want to do anything with it
doesn't necessarily mean that the
equipment is an old functioning order
that depends on the person again it's
usually not quite a sexual thing it's
more just like a physical thing I'm told
it's a natural thing I just don't have
never tried it don't think I will
because otherwise everyone would say we
were straight and like keep treating us
as straight it doesn't define me but it
is a part of me and I I feel like any
close friends that I have I would want
them to know I told my parents just
because they were bothering me about
like why don't you have a boyfriend and
I'm like I don't want a boyfriend or a
girlfriend or anything your romantic
orientation is completely separate from
your sexual orientation just because
you're asexual doesn't mean that you are
not interested in people romantically
you know by romantic
how romantic all that stuff is on top of
being asexual for that I would say it's
definitely dependent on the two people
or more than two people involved in that
relationship I mean some asexuals will
have sex with their partners I've done
sex with my partner's asexual people and
the east
immunity tend to have this pressure that
they have to conform and they have to
have sex in order to make their their
partners happy when that's not true I'd
much rather just like eat ice cream and
watch a movie it'd definitely be nice to
be acknowledged a little more people
don't really know what asexuality is and
then we have to go on and explain and
then they make these assumptions we're
just normal people just like everyone
else what get it there I gotta get it
yeah you get it
it's here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
