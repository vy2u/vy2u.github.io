athletic when I hear the term perfect
body I think actually the first thing
that triggers in my head is oppressive
we have these standards of what's
considered perfect in our society and
they're very narrow I start to think of
you know what my ideal weight is when I
play and like body fat and muscle mass
and all that stuff the perfect body is
is a body that you're comfortable in I
would also want to add to that is
healthy healthy for you
perfect body also comes with like race
oh why is the world idolizing the
perfect like image and as someone that's
like struggled with body issues not only
as gender dysphoria but also as a black
man who you know when I was younger
would want to look like a tall lean
swimmer and that's not my body type I
grew up skinny all my life but I
deep down I kind of wish I was in that
skinny I wish I didn't have the fast
metabolism so I definitely I think I
should face in a different way than most
people move you over like six-pack abs
and pecs yeah nobody care what I look
like in a bathing suit during the season
as long as I'm able to run you know
eight or nine miles a game perfection I
think at times is unattainable
especially when you're when you are
talking about health and your body and
dealing with women in athletics can
cause a lot of stress especially as a
personal trainer I think of it being so
stifling because I think we all have to
own our bodies and know what's good for
us and know what's healthy for us and I
think the health piece is very very
important the offseasons
my perfect body is a body that is not
aching and a body that is resting but
that has a really nice tan from all
vacationing I'm doing
and of course there are two moments
where I feel like not the best you know
of my body and who I am but I just have
to like accept that this is what I was
given so perfect value to me is just
like Who I am like I look this way and
I'm gonna love myself this way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
