but you have brain two that's really
strong and will do whatever it wants see
I was in Latin class and all of a sudden
I looked down and I had an erection and
there was no reason for me to be
sexually aroused it was like running
around I want a party I want a party I'm
your penis I got called up to the front
of class to translate a sentence I was
panicking I was like I don't know what
to do so I decided to tuck it into my
pants
I kept it hid I kept my weapon concealed
I was terrified that people were gonna
see me and pee we're gonna laugh at me
and point at me he gets turned on my
classwork but thankfully nobody pointed
and laughed at me this was in PE class
freshman year there was this one asshole
that really enjoyed making fun of people
his idea of making fun of me was to draw
attention to his boner because obviously
he gets off from being mean to people
what he didn't realize is that since I'm
gay I would get a boner from looking at
his boner I had to act like it wasn't
doing anything for me but unfortunately
kind of was this happened in eighth
grade at 2:00 p.m. every day during
science class like clockwork I
would get an erection and I needed to
get up to give a presentation I
basically say mr. Mack I'm not feeling
good cuz it's a rager he's like oh
that's a bunch of that's a bunch of BS
after some argument he sent me to
detention I head for the door and I try
to go as fast as I can
and then someone who I'm now good
friends with is like a fat Steve's got a
boner I don't think I ever heard the end
of that so when I was in college when
ripped jeans were really cool I had a
pair and there were definitely some
holes way too close to private areas as
many men experience in the morning parts
of my body began to awake all of a
sudden like I had this weird moment
where I realized the dragon was about to
leave the cave and thankfully I like a
really heavy textbook so I kind of like
just whack Amole that sucker and
we live to see another day every time
I'm on an airplane and the airplane
lands I get a boner I hope that by the
time we get to the gate it goes away it
never does
what I do is I take my backpack and
shimmy out of the plane and hope that no
one else notices that I'm not wearing
that backpack on my back I don't know if
this happens to other people but please
tell me that it does I was out with girl
he came across the sex pills which I
thought would be a fun idea to try they
do a great job too good of a job I took
those sex pills on a Friday night
fast forward to Sunday every year we
have this charity run for this girl in
my town who passed away from cancer
now I thought there's no way there's
still gonna be any of that in my system
but I was wrong I am still like
rock-solid I've got to go see all these
people I haven't seen in years we have
got to do like that awkward but out
these don't let me press you with my
boner type of hug somehow I was able to
subdue it for the race thank God but
right after the race I was back to boner
Ville it was a bet a full four days
until I was actually back to normal one
time I just woken up and walked in the
living room I think I was like 17 my mom
looks down at me and goes you're
saluting me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
