oh my god I've never said this story out
loud so she gets over and we start
watching a movie I'm laying there we're
kissing and stuff like that next thing I
know it's the morning and she texts me
like hey you fell asleep on me oh my bad
I was currently seeing a lady and I had
a roommate that was like right next door
to me pretty loud and he started texting
me to quiet down they didn't want to
stop having sex and I started texting
while continuing she looked back and she
was like what the hell are you doing he
wanted me to go down on him and I don't
like do that on a hook-up like can you
do it though and I'm like no and then we
go do it again I'm gonna be like can he
do it and I was like no I just said no
he just like got up in love I don't even
think he finished I don't even care I
met up with this guy I knew that he
smoked from the way that his lips taste
I had to try so hard to not gag the
problem is that he liked making out a
lot so I held my breath every time he
came in for a makeout so I was with this
guy right when he finished he said I
have to go gyno on you and I was like
what do you mean and he said I have to
go search for the condom your penis was
kind of small that the condom fell off
of your penis and stayed in my vagina
and I was like no thank you I'll just
grab it myself I was sleeping in my
friend's bed when I was visiting her in
college and she had gone out and she
came back she was so drunk she forgot
that she offered me the bed and she
brought back a male suitor they had sex
next to me do they not know that I'm in
the bed they're in the bed they were
just so drunk they didn't know that I
was in the best she's literally bumping
me with her head as he is like in the
rhythm basically by the end of the night
they were having sex almost on me I
didn't want to say anything because this
was a guy that she's been trying to get
with for like an entire semester know
just a really good friend
and it was actually kind of validating
to realize like it took her a while to
she makes similar sounds do I win I must
win something I win this whoever else
you have in this I win right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
