doing this but I have a feeling we will
be this week yes we might have to
reschedule
we're gonna get handcuffed I'm a little
scared people don't really know how
close me and Cain are I've borne his
underwear before and I also found out
that night that she uses three towels to
shower I don't think there's too much
more I could learn about game but we
haven't hung out in a while so I'm gonna
take it yeah so we used to sit next to
each other we spent seven hours a day
just seeing each other for like a whole
year I mean I kind of wanted to do this
I could spend time with Freddie
since we don't we're so busy do you like
cuddling I love to cuddle can I be the
little spoon absolutely not okay
absolutely
are you right-handed I'm right yeah this
is already like we won I know this
position but we won all ready I don't
even
yeah okay my gosh where's the key wait
what did we sign up for literally okay
see see what happens
like who drives I guess I have to drive
yeah you yep you drive I get to sit back
in the car and show how Sheree what it
is I don't know right now we're about to
go eat and hopefully people don't give
us with legs
yeah we kind of do one at a time
like oh I guess you could really have
her on the old ball-and-chain gonna be a
long we have to go to Ikea at you're
running errands
we've decided to hold hands because it
looks better it just looks like a
bracelet now instead of like this it
might just look like an S&amp;amp;M thing yeah
this choker is not helping there is a
chance that Freddy could get really
annoyed by me
Jane is always hot and he's always
having to take off his jacket it's hard
it's very hard that's the hardest thing
about this and my hands are sweating my
face is sweaty awkward of course it's
just a lot of walking and a lot of
sweating and it was exhausting
yeah we're so tacky preparing it now
we're gonna get paid kids I've never had
one before pedicure birthday this will
be fun red the nail shop probably the
most awkward place we've been today but
they've been very accommodating they let
us sit next to each other they move this
closer so it'll be more comfortable the
lady didn't notice and she looked up and
she's like ha invading me she's like
turn to Freddy's lady and they were
talking about it she's like what's
happening and I understood cuz I
speaking to me this day needs in thank
you so much I love you too
I think we're just like moving as an
amoeba and so that's just been like
exhausting it's like two brains in one
body
moving in slow motion I also wanted to
get like Korean barbecue since Freddy
hasn't gone Korean barbecue and cooking
with Korean barbecue is really difficult
because you have to actually make the
food and we had to like there's like
different like trays of things and a lot
of things do you care about snoring yes
I smell really loud oh hell no so it's
12:30
zero sleep we're not going to be able to
sleep so we're about to do so watching
Netflix until dawn
you can't cuddle in turn with handcuffs
on No so we didn't last very long at all
okay so it's the next morning still
handcuffed but now we're gonna be
released for good the takeaways were it
was hot it was sweaty it was exhausting
but also it was a cool experiment just
to be able to hang out and have a reason
to just like be next to each other side
all day
he was sweet it was like we were like a
couple for a day Hey
yeah if you haven't hung out with anyone
for a while and you want to just like
spend the whole day with them this is a
nice experiment yeah
never again nope nope</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
