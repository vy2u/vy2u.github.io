this hurts this hurts also Wow
we are gonna get handcuffed together for
a whole day I will give up my dominant
hand for you Jen that's how good of a
friend I am that's cool cuz I was not
gonna do that it's hard to reach Tommy
we get dinner after work but then like
when we leave Jen just disappeared I
guess like when you're handcuffed
together the whole point is that we're
gonna see a new side to each other I
don't like people in my space I think we
both like space I've never brought any
of my work friends a church I think
we're come out of this with like a
deeper appreciation for each other oh so
sweet of you to say that I'm very
optimistic hmm confession I have
claustrophobia I just got that wave just
now I never regret anything until after
I've done it Cheers oh stop moving it's
gonna be good not laughing oh you think
now you oh dude you looking at my shirt
brah 24 hour starts now you know we're
just doing with two friends new could
just walk animals and get rid of garbage
yeah I'm just walking Jenny's walking
the dog here we go it's a dog just
pooped
I don't want to get close to it why
using my hand use your other hand to
hold the dog
we're gonna go run some errands okay to
eat I need to eat for sure yeah and I
gotta go get my weak heart renewed so
we're gonna go to point what Steven how
do you feel you feel at home here
totally we uncuffed while we were in
there cuz we figured that would be a
surefire way to get kicked out people
are gonna look at me and Jenn and be
like that is the most controlling
boyfriend in the world and that is wrong
on so many levels people for a second or
like oh it's sweet they're holding hands
and then they look closer and they're
like nope just crazy this lady's the
counter she looked at us for a second
not really paying attention she's
looking looked away and then she was
like ooh I mean there's only two options
right yeah either we're crazy or we're
also we're very dangerous Oh right now
we want to get food we passed him it's -
on our way here we I don't even know
what that is it's so cool it's like a
Japanese like supermarket with the food
court because hard to reach shopping we
found these little koala thingies and we
both used to eat them a lot as a kid it
was weird cuz we don't really hang out
on the weekends very much and so we
found out a lot about each other just
from living together so we also just had
coffee and now I have to go to the
bathroom do you hope yeah
wait what I I miss her already that's
also the time when I found out that
she's a very fast pooper you sure you
wash your hand
belt so can you smell him what else it
the Asian pear eats an Asian pear ready
set go
hmm I have a friend named Jeff who I
hang out with a lot Jeff yeah
you've heard about Jeff yeah he does it
he doesn't know dude I watch The
Sopranos with Jeff with Jeff yeah I go
get burgers with Jeff often times with
my friend Jeff dude Jeff all right so
this is my buddy Jeff no and this is
Stephen you guys are meeting I'm also
gonna go to a party after this with
people that we went to college with I
saw I didn't realize you had all these
friends like you live like to live Jenn
all right Jenn every night I faced on my
girlfriend
who's your girlfriend today - yay I love
you I'm happy to have her to be my
girlfriend hi hi Aang how are you tell
me everything how was your day what is
up no this is my team with very not
yours and then they ended up having a
better conversation than me my
girlfriend's 19 hours left and we're
going to church tomorrow we have
ourselves to the fou-fou tepui the view
is it not as few an air mattress in my
bedroom we're not gonna be handcuffs but
we can like lean down and like kick each
other
yeah good night night morning world
morning or snow cause I've never brought
any of my work friends a church I'm
excited I think it'll be cool
what are you it's done oh I just dropped
his phone the fact that I forced you to
come to church with me made it a lot
easier for me to invite
from under my space but now I'm like why
didn't I do that like why don't I bring
my friends to places where I hang out
where I think we're better friends
because of it actually one hour of hang
time celebration of ice cream you know
what it is is days for us to plan fun
things we can do we're a great week gun
really happen I know I get times is
probably uncomfortable for you is also
and come battle for me at times really
was never enough room for me I thought
it was gonna be bad but it was actually
good yeah I thought it's really nice but
the thing is like you compartmentalize
friends in rows
you know the parts of you that I don't
see every day that doesn't mean they're
not there we just took our friendship
and we're like hey you're gonna see all
the other parts of my world we did it
for 24 hours eight minutes
five new engine handcuffed him huh at
the end of it like when we uncuffed to
be honest I was kind of sad there are
friends in our life that you only want
to have them around you for a specific
amount of time but I found out that I
could be around her 24/7 and probably
never be annoyed we out we out yeah yeah
yeah what's up what's up what's up
what's up America where your heart drops
get in Stephen coming at you in the back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
