I'm a night show Oh awesome
okay you know I shower together hey I'm
Chris I'm Brittany and we're getting
married for a week but we don't believe
in rings
Chris and I have been really good
friends for about five years we don't
get to hang out that much anymore
Brittany needs to go to her fella I
don't really expect anything negative to
happen but I don't know what I'm not
accounting for who does this belong to
we're probably gonna argue and get
annoyed with each other oh he's really
horrible at planning and I'm like a huge
planner what do you wanna do today what
do you want to do for dinner
I did forget this was happening today I
think I like spending time with other
people more than she does
I really like spending time by myself I
do let's do this welcome home honey it's
not that messy I just was drunk last
night I think we should focus on
spending time doing stuff together yeah
yeah getting my house together
and I feel like you got me on a messy
day expired boy shoes anyway it is my
bad um okay
when's the last time you wash the sheets
I think these are clean should we crack
we gotta get Thai food I hate decisions
together it was only difficult in terms
of food I don't really like Thai food we
can cook something I've frozen chicken
I could do a sandwich something feels
different
yeah like some kind of change I feel
like we have more awkward pauses now
make this work we make this work I think
the thing that could go the worst is if
you guys do fall in genuine love what
seriously just come on on the side you
that say I mean I don't like boners I
could probably gonna be a problem
oh thank you five minutes under the
blanket so yeah to get up in the middle
and feel the bathroom now I just do it
right here
good morning make sure we didn't know we
were gonna do for dinner and then we
decided last minute to go out to Korean
barbecue with Neil Kelsey and Justins
then we went to a dance party
Britney Lake is like drinking drinking
drink drunk
I
have their keys so she wanted leaving
she was like it's totally fine if you
want to stay I mean Chris should have
left with me but it's fun honey I'm home
Brittany so I'll sleep on the couch and
I'm gonna wake her up am I here to bed
but if I'm gonna be totally honest I'm
gonna masturbate first on Saturday we
did like domesticated things what are
you doing honey
my taxes looking through your bank
account
what's a strip club stuff we can write
that off I'm really excited to cook
dinner for him tonight and just show him
how much I appreciate spending time with
him well it is now 8 o'clock I asked
Chris if he would be home at 7:00 he was
late dinner is on the table it made me
feel like kind of crappy because it was
just kind of like me sitting there with
a meal that I made for my husband I've
dug I was on a run that turned into a
walk that turned into a pond or sash and
I forgot that I was supposed to be back
in time for dinner
cuz I'm not used to having a wife I'm
used to living on my own but I'm gonna
make it up to her I have a really
special lady day planned and I think
it's going to make her really happy
we're gonna go to dock center pretend
like we're a couple looking care dogs
it definitely felt like it was like
catered to me and he wanted to like do
something nice for me and that was
really cool all the does makes you think
about with a marriage right there's more
than just has to match up in like
chemistry you have to have the same
taste in dogs when you're married to
somebody you aren't just their friend
you also are their intimate partner I
got it - all day day pass at a day spa
with a couples massage I'm Matt and a
body scratch
I feel valued take the focus off of
yourself and put on the other person
when you're planning a day you're
planning the day for them and not in a
way that you feel like you're their
slave but in a way where that makes you
happy yeah like you got to go to the
spot - so it's like cool for him I got
us tickets to The X Factor I'm gonna
take my wife out you know the nice way
where it's pretty tired they're just
sick did I plan a good day yes leg it
has been your great husband bringing
that no okay our romantic date was
really fun it was like one of the
coolest days it's been planned for me so
relax so that good night me so
comforting to have a nice partnership
and be able to spend your life with
somebody that you love yeah but
no I would say I'm excited for the
divorce but I think it like needs to
happen I don't I don't one of ours
be like Miss New Year well I hope you
still come and hang out with me
