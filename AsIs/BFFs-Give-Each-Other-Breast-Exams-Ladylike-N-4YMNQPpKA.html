gun give a little squeeze whose bosoms
Tata's gazongas love pockets what else
are we calling them we've got them but
what are we supposed to do with them
it's ladylike and we're giving ourselves
breast exams I mean my twins are like
two kids that I say I love equally but I
really love one better than the other
called them Siegfried and Roy which one
is the one that got mold Siegfried yeah
what's the left one I started doing
exams on my breasts probably five years
ago it's just like a good habit it's
like brushing your teeth but it's
brushing your boobs with your fingers I
do it never I do it when I go to the
doctor they do it for me
my breasts are kind of an afterthought
because they're small I think
subconsciously that gives me a reason to
not pay as much attention to them that
that probably should if there was
something new popping up I feel like I
would notice but maybe I should be doing
it more than I do
at 17 I went in for a routine physical
at which point they found a lump I had
never done any sort of self breast
examination my doctor made the decision
for me to get surgery to remove it which
happened three days after I turned 18 it
was really scary it ended up being a
benign tumor and although I was so
thankful that it was benign it made me
wonder you know what if that wasn't the
case it's really important to take
charge of your life and to take charge
of your health we're going to go visit
dr. sherry and she's going to teach us
how to touch our boobs correctly I guess
because I don't examine my breasts
regularly I don't really even know what
to look for I'm gonna be touching some
breasts I'm excited for Freddie to grope
my boobs all right let's go caps of eels
welcome ladies
I'm dr. Shari Ross also known as dr.
Shari I love that you're here learning
about women's health anything vagina
anything breasts it's it's really an
important area to talk about hi dr.
Shari hi
we like vaginas - they're more into
vaginas than they are in - breasts I
agree as a whole
yes are intimidating and I think that's
why a lot of women are afraid to sort of
touch that should we get into it let's
go wash our hands
all right wash my hand let me lay down
lay flat okay we're gonna check your
breasts all right well that's what we're
here for so sit right into it you really
want to check your breasts ideally right
after your period because who gets PMS
and breast tenderness right before their
period any of you yes yeah that's a bad
time to check so I always like to say
let's check usually on day four or five
of the cycle I'm on day five well you
may be the first one to test our exam
what we're gonna do first is have you
extend the arm address you're checking
you're gonna use your opposite hand
second third fourth finger three fingers
got it and I like to think of the breast
of the plus sign so I always start on
the outer pocket moving inward and then
I'll go to the lower quadrant coming
inward but as long as you pick one
method that you feel comfortable doing
press firmly and drag your fingers
across tissue okay they don't worry
about no circular if it's easier and it
has to be a little firm even a little
uncomfortable most of time hopefully no
one's really touching your breast is
hard well it depends you know I like it
- coming more lateral more to the
outside this outer quadrant here right
this is where most of the breast tissue
is breast tissue really feels lumpy you
know I like to describe it similar to
like a bowl of oatmeal or grits but it
doesn't feel like grits as you said I
don't think maybe it's more of like a
polenta or like a quinoa it feels like
cottage cheese when I used to be said
that my boobs are small my mom would
tell me that all you need is a mouthful
oh very few grits in here hello great
really yeah you're gonna love this bread
with cheese you're gonna
hungry over here the thing is if you
know what's normal
you've been checking your breasts and
you know your breasts are typically
lumpy then you'll know it's not normal
wear your bra line it's you can sort a
few little cystic changes you feel those
little cystic areas you're looking here
with this
that's your rib you want to start at a
really young age to just know your body
know your breasts it could start as
early as 12 to 13 even if you don't have
a breast cancer history I'm encouraging
all of you to start checking your
breasts monthly because it's not cancer
that we're always looking for we're
looking for cysts we're looking for
change is that you know you should be
aware of but the only way to really know
the difference is because you've been
checking then I want you to come under
your armpits moist
it's true haha well we're full-on in the
armpit that's really where we want to be
that's right
right in there deep okay dig in there
your feeling around for lymph nodes okay
the lymph nodes should feel like normal
lymph nodes feel like little piece
little tiny piece that feels strange
when I touch that that'll look node of
some kind that's just your bone no
that's just the bone who knew that like
a pizza size would feel so good so where
were you were abroad Anoma yes that's
where it was and they did a really nice
scar along the areola so it doesn't
stand out parties very well done thank
you
she's still got it Marshall wound has
still got it do you want to feel I do
now might be a good time yeah oh I
didn't mean to seem like something that
has no let me do that a little cable
sweater inside your boobs
I think SAFF and I have the same spread
he's also a lot smaller than me what we
have the same
lastly okay we can check for nipple
discharge so take a look kind of give a
gentle squeeze
okay gentle oh oh yes I forgot about
Caesar break she's doing it a lot if you
only have to do it once or twice
not seven or eight not seven or eight
times are you sure maybe a nine that I'm
just forget it feels completely normal
yes yes thank you for sharing a lot of
fun dr. sherry was awesome she put up
with us and she taught us new things I
think we all learned how weird boobs can
be they're all weird
in special ways yes some I love you
summer smooth summer grit see I think
I've eaten a grit before I love great
one grit but you have to know your
breasts to know when if normal is that
one thing that dr. sherry told us was to
start checking when you're so young hmm
I thought that I was already starting
early by doing it at 17 but I was late
to the game you know I could have caught
it a lot earlier and I am so late to the
game what was I doing at 13 like playing
Age of Empires and eating pretzels yeah
playing Legos yeah exactly
thank you dr. sherry yeah this one's for
you lady tested lady will continue to
test every month five days after your
period begins do it thank you so much
