living in Manhattan I go to the Dalton
school wherever senior this is my dog
Barbie and this is my house so welcome
to it I've lived here since I was three
Paige still on 69th Street and then we
decided to move around the corner for my
grandparents so your whole life right

most interesting neighborhood which I
wish it did but this is where I am this
is what I love I am I'm going to
Cambridge I don't like that it's weird

that'll be a new thing and then I'll
come back and not live on the Upper East
Side today I'm meeting up with my
friends clarin Rachel so we're gonna go
get lunch and then we're gonna go prom
dress shopping
Rachel's been at Dalton since
kindergarten she's like the blunt and
I'm like it's sensitive and wimpy turns
out that's a pretty good combination
yeah you do Blair came in ninth grade
Hey
like she's super like artistic and
interesting and like really good at
being friends with older people I made a
friend who's going to school with me but
my current friends aren't really gonna
be they're not gonna be around me I
signed up for like pre orientation and
like moving day and everything and it's
gotten me really like freaked out I
don't know what I'm nervous for but I
know I'm nervous I don't know anything
else other than like this I'm like what
am I gonna do during the summer knowing
it's like the last time they'll hang out
with my friends or like the last time
we'll all be in the city together for a
long time we're gonna look like
Millennials who are always on our phones
and we're gonna get for its own
pile
oh hi on the phone pile you better go
this is your yeah crack first one to
grab your phone Hey the entire feel all
right half bird I'm at me
fried chicken and we're eating a lot and
then we're gonna go try on dresses so
the glitch would walk it'll be fine
still live on second in permission to
take my phones in the phone
no no I saw a picture nah I find what I
feel like you don't have the best angle
for the lighting though I had to explain
to my mom on basic meant this morning
and it was like really actually kind of
far she thought it meant like a like
original or like simple like but it's
not it's more complex than that it's
like not to class my parents so many
times
are you gonna get with her and I asked
him like more and he was like you ruin
it like what are you doing like blah
blah blah like way to go Eliza and I was
like okay and then they hook up
so what do you want I know I just
artificially boys can't just answer
questions through everyone's eyes like
girls are so complicated I'm like we're
really not if you're just like able to
handle normal things that like
understand
I love this personally I think you
should try on that one this one this one
that you like I'm saying that my
grandmother would you like to try a hot
ride on what I didn't even tell what no
what about this one Eliza I asked me
that you'd wear this I would not know I
think it's pretty no no I
Wow such a nice color for you I'm gonna
do kind of like I can't even tell nah my
god this is so your vibe it's quite
interesting strongly dislike ton I
really like that it's gold but this is a
lot but I really like that it's gold and
also you can see my bra strap I don't
think you two could see yourself a prom
with this dress but if I if I woke up
and I was like woah I'm not from that
I'm in this dress I wouldn't I would be
be really happy why do you like doctor I
know I knew you were gonna like it
oh that's a good one this is very Rachel
I feel like much more your style
thank you I would never really expect to
see that color with you that's right it
works our thing also like looks go with
your hair yeah it makes you look blonder
I don't know I like I like I think
indecisive yeah she's indecisive she
can't decide
so pretty yeah I love it I love the
color the second night the back is a lot
problems your last big event in high
school do you feel like this is how you
want to be remembered
yeah greater things besides nothing nice
yeah I know is she like really not
easier so that's pretty cool of my leg
sometimes hearing is like I'm actually
really this leads down like that yeah
yeah you another one
I feel really nervous about the future
in general like up to like like a week
in advance I won't like I'll shut it
like my mom tried to talk to me about
summer and I was like no that's no
summers like not real every top college
tour we did I was like does everyone
find their people and every time the
guide was like yes everyone finds their
people I feel secure enough and real
friends I don't feel like oh my god

go to school and they find their people
and like I'm not gonna replace my
friends as we get closer and closer I'm
actually like quite excited I get very
excited like thinking about like my
friends growing up because like I'm just
so excited to see like who they're gonna
be they're gonna do such cool things
