Freddie is when she gets mad cuz I get
little arias she's so little and
adorable but like when she's mad she's
just like I don't have time and you
think okay it's kind of scary I'm gonna
be honest this was my idea because I
love that show wipes waffle we're not
hanging not us hanging anything we're
switching uh ladies and I was like okay
what if we swapped boyfriends and
freddie was like I'm kind of mad about
it but okay could you guys think that
it's weird that we're doing this I'm
okay with it yeah it's gonna be fun
laughs fun I think it's gonna be to be
fun to get to the hang out with Freddie
some more I think I'm gonna learn a lot
about you about Game of Thrones Oh about
cat care yes crusty sick so we have to
go get him vitamins I think you are
gonna be doing that you're gonna end up
with the ball that's fine I don't go to
the mall often yeah no well I go a lot
yeah he's gonna want to skate he's gonna
want to go to like the skate chat with
his friends and like other socially
awkward skateboarders that make me feel
uncomfortable oh she loves açaí pose
oh that's fun yeah I like those things
oh great okay I'm excited it's gonna be
funny we started off at breakfast all
four of us mmm nice breakfast little
eggs we'll bacon little chitter little
chatter we're gonna go
don't selfie stick my selfie sticks
we're gonna go our separate ways and
then we're gonna meet up after pulse
show we're gonna go to my show I'm in a
musical the weather was kind of happy
yeah it was you shan't be late
borrow their boyfriends clothes
we set it off at the mall okay walk
around hit all the spots we just went to
came from the Lego store it was fun very
overwhelmed with all the different types
of leg
guys really stepped it up but we got an
air freshener probably the best smelling
car air fresheners of all time it's a
flavor called light squash also happy
with this
just like spray then we of course hit
the other spots which were like Sephora
yeah a lot of different colors I love
that love color I showed him your brow
pencil I use the spoolie to brush his
eyebrows up
I need that I would totally like
get made up you down saying leg would
sit in the makeup chair just let them do
whatever really fun very overwhelming
support school it's like the Lego store
almost more things to play with it in
the Lego store Barnes and Noble
oh that's a great Barnes &amp;amp; Noble that's
a really style I've never been in there
solid Barnes and Noble so our first stop
was Petsmart and we're gonna get crusty
vitamins like hopefully they're having
an adoption situation it should be
written so I can't play with them and
maybe get one sometimes they have this
box of cats that are like this big and
sophis holding four of them on our
chests and they're just like dangling
her chest so Freddie just texted us that
she found a cat
what are you gonna do Chi legit adopts a
cat today you know that when Quinta got
a cat freddie was like now I need to get
a cat
we found a cat that a Freddie I think
put in a request and application he
doesn't have a dick but I he's a great
cat I do know I'm just kidding I'm just
kidding me I know I'm not kidding
actually they were like we don't know
his penises um he loves me
shinobi should know he's a cat his
gangsta name will be ssin asti she know
dick so anyway we were there to go to
the cat adoption but we were also there
to get pills for my cat crusty greeted
us right at the front door hey crusty
I'm ready we went back to the apartment
and we gave the cat the pills yeah yes
whoo okay where are we okay right now
we're at Babylon
shop my
and work it but we did go to the skate
shop and the bowl was wet and it's metal
so you don't really want to be doing
that either
so there's they have a kitchen in the
back that's where people like me are
meant to skate he put me on his board
what's the name of the board
Shh N Shake Junt is the name of the
board there was only enough room for me
to kick and like coast what I was doing
was I was standing on the board and then
kind of cooling like get myself from one
end to the other pulling myself in
retrospect I'm glad you guys didn't
actually have Sofia go into the bowl
well is when the second she gets on that
ball
you know tumble I brought Sally to my
favorite I thought you go play you're
about to cry
I love acai bowls a lot so I was just in
heaven we got there and then we went
thrift shopping how I tried on this
badass white Lakers bomber jacket I knew
sock was gonna like that bomber jacket
because he likes his Street Asian style
somewhere in between kpop and Caleb from
Pretty Little Liars - the B that's my
ideal style but I'll settle for pants
did get a Hawaiian shirt this is a
pretty stylish white shirt we can kind
of pull off some style and then after
that we went to my show Paul had to be
there a little bit earlier for his call
so I went to get a coffee by myself and
I think that Freddy and Tyler are gonna
actually meet up with us because they
ran out of stuff to do
wait we have to wait for Tyler
they're making out look at that printed
shirt oh wow
you look just like Fred no no like that
watching the show and just like sitting
and like relaxing was like a nice ending
to that day literally all four of us are
just like exhausted we swapped
boyfriends for a day I was planned I
just thought it was done that we all got
along so yeah and we took it outside of
work we're all like hanging out and like
it's like yeah let's hang out more
yeah it was cool to see that the
friendship was transferable Paul is
similar enough to you that I was like oh
this is fun it is kind of like hang on
Frankie
yeah if anything this brought us closer
yes yes yes great soft has been the
homie for a minute I think the moral of
the story is just that like I need to
get this cat I was with Paul when we
were getting the text about Freddie got
me to cat and I was like Paul just give
it up like you are a cat daddy now cat
daddy anyway
have you accepted it Paul yeah I finally
came to get him she know he's mine
she'll be
Kenobi now look</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
