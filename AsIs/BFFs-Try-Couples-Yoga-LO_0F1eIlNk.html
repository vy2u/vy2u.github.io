I'm going to be teaching partner yoga
two best friends partner yoga is
slightly different than regular yoga
it's a little bit more intimate and you
get to have a deeper connection with
another person I think I'm like overly
confident about it
I'm underly confident so I feel like we
even each other out oh I'm nervous I'm
really excited I'm off with Gaffey we go
to yoga twice a week together but we've
never done it together so I think it's
time to take our relationship to the
next I think it's gonna be fun it'll be
a good bonding experience yeah I can't
wait to put my crush from his face me

down oh yeah no are you okay yeah I've
