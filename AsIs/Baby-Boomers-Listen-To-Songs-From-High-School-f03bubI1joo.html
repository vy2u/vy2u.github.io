get up and dance to this song
my favorite song in high school was hold
the line by toto the carpenters the Bee
Gees like hard lot well we considered a
hard luck at the time a lot of Led
Zeppelin D purple just hanging around
our friend's garage you know drinking 12
ounce bottles of beer some people would
be smoking pot that brings back memories
of one specific girlfriend Terry when we
were headed to the beach to go camping
that weekend the song came true Saturday
Night Fever was the movie of movies
totally reminds me of me and all my
girlfriend's standing in front of the
mirror and trying to get the moves right
I went about the album I listened to it
constantly I never admitted to anybody
that I liked this song that I love this
song I saw them in concert at Anaheim
Stadium with foreigner Ted Nugent REO
Speedwagon and Leonard Skinner one of
the greatest concerts of all time when I
was in ninth grade for the first time
somebody said they didn't want to have
anything to do with me anymore and I
literally played this song end to end
for like three days and cried like a
bitch in my bedroom one of my girlfriend
said this song was perfect for me
because I was as cold as ice
the boss oh my first concert was
probably the best concert I ever saw it
was like four hours we were on the floor
seats one of the best experiences of my
life this is not a song that I would
have listened to because like the bad
guys and this is what I definitely
remember is the odor of pot I stood up
on the armrest of the chair and danced
through the whole thing he was drenched
in sweat doesn't give you a sense of the
freedom of being out there and being
young music to find so much of your life
and when you hear that song on the radio
it transports you back to a different
time a different year a different age
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
