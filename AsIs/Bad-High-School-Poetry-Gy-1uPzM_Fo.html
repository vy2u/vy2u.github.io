this is my collected works about ten
years in the making
really excited to share them with you
hey Ron well let's take it away I'm
gonna start with one of my favorites
it's a circa 2004 why do they assume
I'd pay in money why not pay in love or
homegrown vegetables
hmmm something on my favorites which
really captures a moment in time
my head hurts it's been hurting a lot
lately
could it finally be my period
that went packing three to four months
ago
we can only hope
beautiful beautiful
July 3rd 2004 this house
I'm going for a run
first Alice Meg's movie Laura's pants
Katie's earrings and Katie's pants
Ella's books I borrowed two lowers other
pants
Krista I took two pants and to shirt
remember this book got some choice
choice fits in here page is blank and
visually displaying to a hostess dilemma
late stuffy afternoons are spent holding
up the walls with boredom eagerly I oh
wait interruption only to be awkwardly
rejected by men with cigars who would
rather hang out at the bar
i watch the ladders and drinkers of a
Spanish restaurant down the street and I
them with a stare
she's our tacky green place another one
for a hostess days the human spirit is a
fascinating thing not the sole portion
per se but the part that is lifted with
a kind word the part that falls with a
cold
Pikul spirit a girl just told me I
looked like a dancer I smiled and I sat
a bit straighter a real dancer just did
a combination and my arrogant spirit
takes rest in the pit of my stomach
middle ground is so unsatisfying
thank you thank you as hostess days were
rough shall we
as of September 26 days without a
muffins less bagel / cookie there are no
days listed this one just says dude turn
it around it's easy I think you can all
learn something from that really is mmm
men lose their high aspirations as they
lose their intellectual tastes that was
John Stuart Mill's I did not write now
but I wanted to share it with you
I remember this time in my life this
book here I was going through a hard
time as all young women do I had some
feelings for maybe a boy at the time
and it doesn't always work out and I
don't want to draw any attention to who
that might be
in my life show Saint Jim but I hope
wherever this unnamed person is they
learn a little about what I was going
through at the time
if you said I was flighty and I flew
left you alone until you knew that you
missed me what would you do
best others list to flourish shirts
scrubs Meg's movie Krista's shoes yellow
shirt green and gold today like your
eyes
look my way try me on for size
I hurt because he does but not as much
I fear when he tells others but I find
no blame
am I being frivolous no guilt is not
love things are so different
he is so different he's not you and I've
regretted that time was the catalyst
welcomed by soul and sin and I cannot
help it I believe perhaps foolishly that
being in love is all-encompassing how
can I want him in front and I may still
live for your whim
I want to make you happy by nature I am
a creature who aims to please it is
painful to see the pain I subjected you
even more so to not see you I fear will
get easier I fear we will forget I fear
I brought me another that's you soon
simple remains what it is wasn't would
be inevitable not yet
later I'll get back to that this page
just says always yet this is a good one
hmm going to prom with Kyle
going to Chicago tonight going to get
better in time going out of my mind I
took my lipgloss back biatch give back
the other more nude no j.crew polo tea
for you
doesn't begin to cover it
it's not even panic or desire for
clarity over the lack of once or care
which is worse
needless kind of way
so what we have left as you can tell
that was a very trying time mm-hmm if
there's some choice to bits for us here
oh we've been through that one I think
we've skipped one of my favorites I
might have to go back and find it which
foam is so special such a part of me I'm
really grateful that you're here mmm
you can close out on this one this is a
lovely lovely one from my later years a
deep cut a few of them on the course of
my wanderings I came across a month
now this dog thought very highly of
himself and when I mustered the courage
I asked if he cared for her wrong tail
to the sky and bright eyes half-closed
he said well I suppose you'll do and off
we went blind to the world around us
racing with our eyes closed I missed him
as he left and disappeared over the
horizon tail to the sky I always left in
a moment
thank you thank you cool well thank you
Iran thank you so much for sharing this
with us thank you for lending your ears
and your hearts I want to close out with
some a bit of a flute piece that I hope
you'll all join me on thank you
let's hear it again for Aaron on the
stand this it's a snare some sort yes
thank you thank you you're on you can't
hear the crowd but they're going wild at
home and let's hear it for cool will
over here on the sax we've been working
together for a long time now they've
supported my work always ten years in
the making thank you guys thanks for
being here I hope you'll join us next
