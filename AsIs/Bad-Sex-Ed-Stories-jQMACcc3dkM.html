hey class were you ever wondering if you
could pee inside of a girl so freshman
year we had to take sex ed and our
teacher told us to never have anal sex
because if you do there's a good chance
that the barrier that holds you're
poopin would be broken and so you would
just be pooping your pants all the time
and she was like yeah I have a friend
now he just is wherever he goes I
believed it for years
I think what makes me mad is like it can
make you feel very complicated and more
ashamed of your sexuality in seventh
grade we had a sex ed class where they
constantly preach that the only safe
form of sex was abstinence so they made
us sign a contract that said we would be
abstinent until marriage and I just
thought that was like so duh that's
something that should be our own
decision and it shouldn't be something
that we should be forced to decide at
such an early age so I had sex ed in
middle school she created hand gestures
for us to use to memorize the names of
both female and male genitalia so this
would be like scrotum she's like a tree
thing for like the fallopian tubes or
something and for penis and vagina both
of them were penis so it was a circle
and a slash through it I guess that was
just her like not so subtle way of
telling us that genitals are dangerous I
don't know I've learned a lot better
since then but what's sad is that I've
had I had to do like a lot of research
on my own so I went to a Catholic school
it was within our life sciences class
and the only had sex ed for two days our
teacher decided to put his sweater on
and pull his head through the hole he
was making faces and noises and we were
all kind of sitting there like what is
going on drew and
you told us this is what birth is like I
just think that the school system kind
of failed me in that aspect
sometimes teacher does not know best</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
