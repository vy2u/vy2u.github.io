motorcycles out of about 300 guys or
more in the state of California I'm one
of them and I'm proud to say I'm
becoming one of the faster ones my name
is Christina co-brand and I'm a racer
with we're a West and we're here at Auto
Club Speedway in Fontana
yeah the the pink tails are pretty easy
to spot on the racetrack one guy told me
he said that he was just getting angrier
and angrier as he was trying to catch me
and he said your pink tails were
flopping in the wind back there like ha
ha ha ha good apparently it gets some of
the guys pretty riled up this is Duke
he's my co-pilot my garage buddy my pit
crew my guard dog motorcycle racing is a
very expensive hobby that I enjoy my
full-time job and the chemical engineer
and make turbochargers its track day
which is for us racers it's practice and
they run three groups so you have
beginner intermediate and advanced
it's way funner than the canyons and a
lot safer because Isaiah Newlands to
come scrape you up when you fall down
and this is my bike at the palace hockey
zx10 it's a 1,000 cc motorcycle and I'm
going to be competing in open a
Superbike and open a the Superstock with
we're west of on Sunday my whole life I
have gravitated towards traditional
male-dominated fields and I'm not
entirely sure why that's kind of just
way my brain operates never quite felt
like I fit in with the crowd and here I
feel like I have like I really fit in
one of the best parts about being a
female racer I have no problems be
dazzling my tire warmers be dazzling my
toolbox I love putting on that glitter
eyeliner that matches
the helmet your eyes only thing you need
to see
when my god will wind out there I'm very
grateful that I'm only five foot three
so I could lay on the motorcycle pretty
much become one with it this track you
hit about 170 on the front straightaway
but the first time I did a hundred miles
an hour on the motorcycle was it was
very exciting you know because it's just
the sensation of speed and there's
nothing around you and so exist it's a
really intense sensation of speed can't
get deep save my life I always give me
the excuse you're too intimidating I
could go on and on the reality is that I
don't want to have a penis I like being
a girl I want the boy to be the boy but
just cuz I do stuff doesn't mean you're
any less of a man you just stick around
to see what's underneath them still a
girl I like being a girl I like to wear
heels I like to wear dresses I like to
be taken care of and then love it for a
dude just give me a hug when I come off
the racetrack and say baby you did a
good job that's all
oil chains done I think it's a struggle
a lot of women have that are very
successful in a lot of areas that are
traditionally male-dominated a line from
clueless comes to mind where she wanted
to learn how to do the cool things he
did on a skateboard and he said well if
you did them then what would I do to
impress you
one o'clock session went pretty well
although the wind was quite horrific
they post the lap times here and I'm
fourth fastest I'm pretty stoked with
that today I'm gonna change tires make
sure she's got gas enough tire warmers
and most importantly keep her head in
the game
I got JJ Mader here helping me and
cousin Matty bueno
I'm thrilled that they're out here
helping me working for a beer bacon and
jicama girl to come hang out of my bed
race day for an amateur you usually wake
up at the racetrack I will usually make
a breakfast for her because you really
have to get a decent breakfast in you
get some fresh tire on and you're ready
for a race
and number 352 Christina Cooper and
outside front bro
she's in sixth place
six hot on your tail
magatsum was a really good race from
Prada highroad I had a really good start
my arms are sore and tired from just
push pulling I mean look at my hands
blisters on my hands
to fifth places in the big-boy class and
the white came home or one piece
nobody's injured it's a good day in my
book I am in a position with my racing
that I never even dreamed I would get to
if I end up inspiring other girls to go
pursue their dreams whether it's to ride
a motorcycle or to you know go after
that college degree or pursue whatever
it is that they're excited about then
I'm happy about that
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
