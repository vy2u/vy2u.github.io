most expensive time of the year it just
puts a drain into my wallet and I'm just
trying to find a way to save money I've
been seeing a lot of these holiday
makeup kits that are really good deals
but I just want to know if they are
comparable to some higher-end makeup
kits and if so then why am I not buying
them for every single one of my friends
I'm gonna be like the Oprah and the
friend group and just be like holiday
kit for you holiday kit for you and
holiday kit for you
so I have my good friend Jeanine from
Texas here and she knows all about
makeup beauty all that jazz she's gonna
help me create a holiday look what's
your strategy going into this I'm gonna
try and be as unbiased as possible
and give them an equal chance so this is
the Ulta beauty treasures 73 piece
collection that's a lot of countries
that's a lot of makeup this will last
you till next Christmas that's a good
bang for your buck for sure I'm gonna
take off my makeup start with the clean
face okay so we got the eyeshadow
palette and the blush bronzer palette
with highlighter it gave us two brushes
it actually feels really soft
I'm impressed it's a little squirrel
tail anyway it's a more eye shadow right
here oh wait is it a shadow
oh no it's eyeliner everything so the
only thing that I'm seeing that they
don't have is eyeshadow primer and let's
see what it's Troy wait how many
favorite primer it's pretty blendable
which is good pretty pigmented there is
a bit of fallout not gonna lie okay so
next we're gonna do eyeliner we're gonna
use the shade blackout okay this is
actually really black next I'm thinking
we do the contour blush highlight they
only gave me one brush so you're gonna
have to get a little skillful with this
and it seems like you probably have to
use a lot of product to go a long way
yeah yeah I'm kind of cracking down
there I think I'm gonna move on to blush
now okay my voice likes to show up it's
a little like it looks a bit chalky but
it definitely still shows up like I can
see your cheese popping out and I put a
bit on your nose
boom it's how like a red yes come on
fancy at Ulta
this is actually beautiful and it shows
it really well it's like very pigmented
so Janine had just completed my holiday
look julik holiday ready oh yeah she's
ready for the next holiday party away
with the Ulta alternating with the
football you've been you've been fun
you've been real can you hear the angels
singing now has a lot of great brands
but no eye shadow so we're just gonna
take another kit that we found at
Sephora and it's a two-faced boss lady
beauty agenda kit and this has like an
array of eyeshadows that you can pull
from weight that's so cute what does it
say
don't let today be a waste of me Genda
so you don't just get eyeshadow you get
a planner to Too Faced has her
priorities straight it's like get your
life together and your makeup your
makeup your life in your make I'm gonna
start with a shade called spiked cider
it's like a beautiful brown wow this is
beautiful oh my god I'm gonna take the
shade don't give a fuck and I'm gonna
put that on the outer core I actually
say that all the time like such nuggets
well I say that all the time but the
fudge
so next step is the Marc Jacobs
Highliner crayon I've heard nothing but
good things about this now we're gonna
move on to bronzer and blush and
highlight it's actually funny is the old
to shade showed up more than this one
does yeah it's one that I think is as
pigmented as Ulta one last step my
favorite let's do it
this is NARS Cruella
so bad read Cruella de Vil here we come
we're complete with this before a
holiday kit look what are your thoughts
so both are really great in my opinion I
love them both there's a parable but I
don't know we should pull the people of
busking suit they think so honestly I
thought you just gave me the same
picture like you have the same makeup
and everything I guess the only
difference that maybe the lipstick is a
little darker I'm just kind of like this
one better just cuz it's shimmery so
maybe it's more expensive actually the
one with the bolder lip is much better
there's no point
this is the exact same you can see
highlight more on this alright do you
mean Curtis is right
or I guess I'm just gonna make these
doesn't like a matter let me that's just
cuz they like random sparkly should
achieve effectiveness and that's the
only difference I can tell it's the rest
of it looks the same I'm gonna say this
is the high-end one yeah yeah they look
so similar he's I give Ariana's go like
this so it was very surprised with the
results I felt like a lot of people
thought that the bargain makeup was more
expensive than the actual high-end
brands you don't have to spend a lot of
money
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
