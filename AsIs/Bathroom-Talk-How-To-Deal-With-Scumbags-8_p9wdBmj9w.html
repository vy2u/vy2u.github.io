- Hey you guys, I'm gonna
go pee really quick.
- [Girl] Hurry up.
- It is so hot out there.
- [Girl] My feet hurt so fucking bad.
- [Sansa] Did you see that
group of guys in the corner?
- Oh, oh my god, yes,
the super hot ones?
- No, they're wearing fedoras.
- So have you ever encountered a fuckboy?
- [Girl] What is the
definition of a fuckboy?
- It's like a douchebag.
- They're cute but they are stupid.
- I'm painting myself
a picture of fuckboy.
They often have
one-syllable names as well.
- [Girl] Like Mack?
- [Girl] Greg!
- There's different kinds.
There's like the fox racing fuckboy.
- [Sansa] I'm sorry, what?
- Okay so that one has like a Honda Civic,
and then he has a spoiler
on the back of his
Honda Civic, and he has like rims,
and then he has a fox racing tattoo.
- They're always disrespectful.
- The rule number one
is there are no rules
to be a fuckboy.
Okay so how do you spot a fuckboy?
- It's like a,
- [Other Girl] Yeah,
that's kinda fuckboy-ish.
- The left right is look away,
to pretend like I don't care,
but then I look back, ooh.
- I feel like fuckboys are also boys
that you don't know very well,
but you collect their numbers.
- [Sansa] Though, have
you ever been somewhere
and you just met someone and you
wanna add their phone number to yours
but you don't know their last name?
- [Girls] Yes.
- So you put um like, a noun?
What we're gonna do is we're gonna
each go through our phone and find
our best fuckboy finder.
- I have like a James Temper Tantrum.
- I have someone in here as Cheebs.
- Wolf Tears Osbourne.
- Justin the Cute One From Catering.
- Sansa Don't Answer and
Creepy Guy Don't Answer.
- Taylor Ping Pong.
(laughing)
- I have one that says
just &amp;quot;Guy from Bar.&amp;quot;
- And so I don't really
remember when I did this
but I must have gone through and deleted
everyone that I didn't know.
Cuz I used to have, like a bunch
of Australian guys.
- Okay so I have just dot
dot dot don't. Period.
We were like together at
a bar, we all went out
and then he got really
drunk and he made out
with someone in front of me.
And then, and then the excuse was
I thought she was you.

Cheers to them. They're really fuckboys.

I don't know Area Code 201, anyone know?
- As in a bag of?
- 201 is New Jersey.
(gasp)
- Oh no, I know who that is.
This fuckboy, he, when I was out of town,
took my car and said,
oh uh, I accidentally got in
like this little fender bender
taking your car down the street.
No, this motherfucker was driving
four hours away to like a concert.
I didn't find that out until I had to talk
to the driver who he hit.
Still owes him $400, and I guess
he still owes his ex-girlfriend
like a thousand dollars
cuz we linked up, chatted,
and now she is with a wonderful man
and they live in Florida and she
is a wonderful person,
and a very good friend of mine.
I need another drink.
Anyone need another drink?
Here you go.
- [Girls] Cheers.
(laughing)
- Uh, so I met this guy Chris through
Adult Friend Finder.
Pretender, pre-pet finder.
Here's the thing though,
he was rich as fuck.
He lived in the hills,
so I drove to the Hollywood Hills.
His bedroom had a balcony that went out
and you could jump from his balcony
into the pool and he told me that he'd
done it once before.
And what looked like a
bear skin on the floor.
- [Girl] What the fuck, Sarah?
- It was my most Samantha
moment of all time.
- [Girl] Damn.
- [Sansa] We got pizza.
(girls cheering)

(girls booing)
- I met this like cool
like hipster guy named
Jesse Really Shitty Person.
- Jesse's a hipster name.
- And he was in a band
but they weren't good.
- None of them ever are.
- They never are. It
turned out he was like
playing like five of us.
All of us were friends.
- What an emotional fuckboy.
- That's an emotional fuckboy.
- All right, so what's
our wrap-up for like
advice for girls dealing with fuckboys?
Or girls dealing with fuckgirls or
- Yeah. Don't, don't date a fuckboy,
be a fuckboy.
