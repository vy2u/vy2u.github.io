full face of makeup god no I have to
have makeup
you're gonna put makeup on me Oh yuck
I've been a beauty addict for ever
probably since I came out of the womb I
joined a sorority in college so gotta be
all glam for rush Letta learned real
quick how to do makeup last time someone
did my makeup was about two weeks ago I
love when they do special things with my
eyes my eyes pop or still they tell me I
don't remember the last time anybody did
my makeup I don't do makeup either I'm
80 I don't like makeup it's just a pain
in the butt to use oh I'm sorry I didn't
mean to say but I feels like I'm on a
cloud you get away with murder when
you're 80 oh god I hope not
yeah you do okay it's always nice
especially since it's summer to have a
little bronzy oh wow yeah this one is by
Sephora what color this is called Bora
Bora Bora Bora bites the 400 de Graaff
in this you're filming this ahead god I
thought you were just gonna take
pictures when she wasn't done I have
never worn bronzer be fourth my first
time wearing bronzer first time for
everything
you used to wear like what you're here
to bed with like curlers pink girls
scream girls if you had first period gym
you went to school with them still in
your hair what you didn't have a class
you had gym like in middle school or
high school you didn't bother to take
them out because you are gonna have to
go play gym and then they have a shower
hot steamy shower my mom always tells me
that a darker brow is a little bit more
youthful it is I like to actually do a
little highlight on the inner corner of
the eye too because I feel like that
kind of makes them pop a little more
this feels really cold oh it's cold
is it cold a little bit can you like
look up yeah okay we're gonna just dab
this concealer under here what you don't
like circles under the eyes grandma you
are beautiful just the way you are
by your lifetime so this is my favorite
mascara and it's the cheapest one I get
and I always get the most compliments on
it lots of lashes and I go for the
Maybelline very black a good Maybelline
yes maybe it's Maybelline yeah you
better not be making me look 40 I mean
wouldn't that be awful yes do you have
like a mascara face that you do that's
why mascara faces like I do not want to
attract any men no more of them Oh take
it to the Koffee stuff so we're gonna
take this off the finally pretty
gorgeous I feel like we're going for
that classic Hollywood look right now
we're just gonna go for like a new look
we're going for a natural look like
Grandma 5.0 are you about to poke in my
eyeball look over me look at me I look
like down down down no like your head
down alright are you ready for the
reveal what's not bad so this is your
face oh my god it looked like an old
lady you are in all the way oh damn I am
an old lady the eyebrows are nice the
shadows a little while the light on top
holy crap I got eyebrows galore this is
the most makeup I've worn in a long time
okay no yours looks very good okay fair
enough
it's a lot more than I normally would
wear on a daily basis I would never have
my makeup in like this again never this
is an interesting experience I've never
done a mature face makeup look it's very
different
I feel like makeup can open you up to
conversation and and learning about
someone so there was a lot of fun
and there's beauty in your wrinkles
right you earned those with age oh heck
yeah
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
