you've decided to kind of go back and
kind of look at the inspiration for some
of these tweets
no one's ever looked at a menu and been
like this looks great but I hope that
there's some live jazz because no food
is made better by like some off-tempo
drumming and like noises that sound like
like a mouse is stuck in a steel pipe I
love jazz and I love food but I just
don't want them together and so it is
like this awkwardness going back and
forth between us of tension where I'm
just like I wish you'd stop I wish you'd
stop and then they're just like we wish
we didn't have to do this but no I'm
doing going to a restaurant and a 1ne
live performance while I'm eating
do I want to have the comfort of
sweatpants and the style of jeans style
yeah of course I'm not a monster one of
the main requirements for going outside
is putting pants on that's what we've
all agreed has human society tight
pajama Jean me you have to have a good
reason for why you're like sorry guys I
gave up on pants I just wear pajama
jeans now everywhere I go
killed it with that tree it must have
gotten 1213 retweets on that just nailed
it have these little little sticks well
tiny chicken sticks of legs and that are
very white because they don't see the
Sun I keep them away from the Sun it
just looks really awkward it looks
terrible and I think if all men know
that if you're gonna wear it shorts are
kind of past your knee lanes just be
prepared to look like a get murdered a
fat kid</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
