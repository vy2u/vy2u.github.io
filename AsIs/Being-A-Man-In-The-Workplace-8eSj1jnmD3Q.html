hey is it a rabbit tampon oh oh girl we
say oh thank you alright I'm going to
put these in myself
hey um can you look at the script I
wrote sure you know like for notes no
just like make sure there's nothing
offensive about it why me ah yeah
there's nothing offensive to men oh
thanks
and then my grandpa comes in to be
Bernie
oh that I really did clubhouse really
let's do that okay so any ideas went
where the day-drinking sketch could take
place maybe had a faceb on my brunch
oh yes yes why that's perfect yeah I I
can write it I've been hitting a lot of
brunch spots you know we're actually
gonna put Brittany on this one she's
just written a lot of these I think her
voice really works well with that
subject yeah but we do have a sponsored
video coming in that you'd be amazing
for it's for a golf club company I think
I swore they really your voice would be
so good for it I'm happy to know to try
new things I guess I'm yeah okay so the
French spot oh my hair where hey can you
pick up that cake down the street for
Jen's birthday I've gotta write this
brunch script what why me don't work for
the same team YUM
as you know the kind of the office hi I
am so sorry I'm late
hey Jessica yes hi you ready to run this
thing real quick oh I'm actually I'm not
an actor I'm one of the writers my bad
you don't really look like a writer
anyway is there anything else that I
need sure just get started oh it's great
started
no I thought it was great
there's like so many different voices in
there yeah I love how the major conflict
was ultimately herself it was like so
relatable I use it
oh I'm sorry you go you can go uh
honestly it you know it's a 20-page
script and the only male characters you
have our creepy uber driver the cat
collar and the boyfriend
yeah but the boyfriends one of the main
characters he hardly has a personality
it's just it's you can clearly tell it
it's written by a woman because it's
only about his looks he's just there as
an object um that's an interesting point
of view uh why don't you email that to
me and right or you could just take
notes on this whole meeting and email
those we - I forgot my laptop because
they asked you to take notes not just
that it's just the whole thing feels a
little sexist
you think women in the officer being
sexist which women I don't think they're
sexist I think maybe they really don't
believe that they have the ability to
understand my perspective I know these
don't seem like a big deal to you but
they have real repercussions of my
career if if this continues I'm going to
be in the same exact position in ten
years of all my female colleagues are
promoted that's a huge problem right I
can see you're really emotional about
this what if we just take a couple weeks
just reevaluate the position see if it's
right for you you mean change
departments we'll see
oh
see that she's breathing
oh holy you guys will never believe
what I just went through I was like no
one was listening to me or taking me
seriously because there's like this
system was already in place that I
wasn't a part of or would have to push
my way through entirely to even have a
chance at the head of sales buying
everyone drinks out of Planets right now
you gotta come right the now dude
you gotta come right to go right
no yeah yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
