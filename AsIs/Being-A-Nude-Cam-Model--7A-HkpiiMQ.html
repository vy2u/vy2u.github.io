that's really important a lot of young
girls see me and they like what I look
like they like what my apartment looks
like they like my pets and I think I
want all that but they don't really
understand the job behind it and they
just see what I literally want people to
see
my name is a free hi and we are in my
apartment right so let's go into my
camera I love my camera I feel like
every cam model should have a space that
they create for camming that is
aesthetically pleasing as well as like
comforting because entertaining for a
large or large audience is very
nerve-wracking and it takes me like two
hours to get camera-ready usually HD web
camera bright lights you know and
everyone's gonna be looking generally
everywhere so might as well look great
while we're selling we're generally
selling a sexual fantasy much like in
every other aspect of sex work we are
there's like there's a person personal
aspect to it that you know you're
usually in the cam model's own house
they're able to like generally talk
about themselves and somewhat be honest
you know maybe embellish a little bit to
make themselves seem cooler but I mean
and for the most part in your kit you're
getting a really personal experience no
matter if you're even if you're going
there only for the boobies and only for
the booty you're gonna leave with some
personality whether you like it or not
there's no way that you can not see that
the cam model is
living breathing feeling person I never
actually thought that way I keep you
helping me
yeah no I never that was not the
intention but like our professions kind
of worked out we work together really
well if it's we're in a relationship so
that really helps okay you ready
I had never done any kind of like adult
stuff in front of like recording with
old stuff in front of anyone never had
anyone do adult things in front of me
while I had to sit there and record it
and I mean he understands who I actually
and what I actually like so there's no
like outside expectation for me to be
performing something that I don't you
know what all right so this is my my
booty mirror I get real creative I have
a bunch of stuffed animals which at 22
years old I have trouble justifying
there's like coffee and spaghetti on her
he's a hole in his crotch it's very
embarrassing being a traditionally
attractive woman on the internet usually
means that you're going to get a lot of
young girls following you that's a new
thing I had to get used to especially
with Instagram there's so many little
girls so I try to keep a balance of
reality in there you know that it's a
tough job that in it requires a thick
skin that I have definitely had to learn
to grow did not have a thick skin before
camping that was or before social media
being a feminist on the internet is
pretty much means that you're going to
get a bunch of men that are disagreeing
with you purely on that alone or
harassing you purely for that reason
alone so my being a can model on top of
being a feminist which just put a huge
huge target on my forehead I think the
most common thing associated with cam
models like the thing that you assume is
they must be so comfortable with their
body I like any other normal human being
a self-esteem issues growing up I
started losing a bunch of weight as I
have health issues I have digestive
issues that we don't know exactly what
they are yet doctors are kind of stumped
I have received two notifications today
from Instagram that a friend is very
concerned that I have an eating disorder
apparently this friend can't read
because I posted literally two days ago
about my health issues so if you could
stop getting my photos removed for being
too skinny I'd like that
so I lost all this weight suddenly I was
what I wanted to be what I thought I
wanted to be which was then I hated my
body more than anything else
it took me so long after I lost all the
weight to really just accept that this
is what my body looks like now and that
it may change that I may be able to get
healthier and work out but this is what
my body looks like now and I need to
accept that or I can't work my body
might not change and I still love my job
and I'm still gonna do it regardless I'm
still going to get naked no matter how
skinny I get you know accepting that and
accepting that I needed to stop being so
damn mean to myself about my body in
general like no matter what it look like
changed change my entire life like made
me a much happier person much more
content not just with my job so that
that's cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
