cameras looks like somebody's gonna
shock me that guy's holding a light
saber back there
I think virtual reality really is like
the next big thing I think it's the new
video game or whatever that means
there's like all these people and I'm
like what is about to happen how's this
look as my hair pretty good right Oh got
it right whoa this is gonna simulate a
cell phone so it's going to be when you
press this button here yeah and you hold
it up in front of yourself and walk here
and you'll have 60 seconds to record
whatever you want until you before your
battery dies oh I see oh my god
that's even crazier all right so there's
a bunch of cops here they're like center
around something's going on oh right
here that's not cool on the other side
of a fence there's all these people are
just like kicking and beating this man
and he's screaming way looks and
nobody's doing anything about it of
course nobody's doing anything about it
right of course
because other people do they'll just
watch it's kind of messed up oh here we
go
I couldn't tell before but I think he's
handcuffed I'm looking above I'm seeing
the horror already not moving but
there's like five dudes beating them
same thing they just are not stopping I
don't know I mean I just I can't believe
that that like is real I did not expect
a recreation of real life beating said I
thought it was gonna be some sort of
possibly some you know entertaining game
that was that was not the case
you feel kind of like helpless and
isolated hopefully in that situation you
actually would be able to like somehow
stop it but I do think like the next
best thing is recording it I wonder what
I would really do like what I know you
want to say stuff it's okay to say stuff
but it's like you I don't have the power
to go and arrest the police it's maybe
that's problematic I think when you see
something like that you're like wow that
was horrible but at least like the one
comfort that I have is like the United
States justice system will do something
about it and like people that do bad
things get punished for that and then
like what we've been seeing the past few
weeks is like sometimes that doesn't
happen the thing that was really sort of
just disorienting is that it wasn't one
cop doing it and his partner it was all
these other cops sort of standing around
watching I think every police officer in
the United States probably needs to
experience what I just experienced I
think everyone should give this a shot
and it should not only be for
entertainment I think there should be a
whole universe of stuff that we can use
this for and this is definitely
something I didn't consider at all and
it's really effective</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
