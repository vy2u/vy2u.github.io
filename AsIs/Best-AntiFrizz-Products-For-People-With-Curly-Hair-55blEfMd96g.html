Rebecca today we're going to try the
best anti frizz products for curly hair
you minds like fine but yeah there's a
lot I want to say kinky curls
my thing is is very very thick we're
gonna damp her hair it's a really classy
bottle it is I like the smell like when
I have like stuff that smells like it
all the way here's the thing I don't
like when they say use generously cuz I
just means I'm gonna have to buy a new I
just know I'm gonna need a lot it smells
like a rich lady this already my hair is
like absorbing it it's not thick at all
which I like it doesn't feel like
there's a lot of products in my hair
this is not helping like create any sort
of pattern it actually seems to be okay
and this is like an area of my hair that
gets really frizzy look it's like
straightening it out so I can already
tell like with my hair that this
wouldn't do well I feel like it's giving
your curls moisture but it's not really
giving it that pot I like how light it
feels I don't like a lot of products in
my hair cuz then it feels like it's
weighing my hair down I'm gonna say no
to living food for me because I I feel
like a little wet carrier right
I'd probably give this for me like
honestly I'll give it to okay I give
this a three I think it's pretty okay
average I don't love it but I don't
paint it either Oh what was weird this
is what this is like for me like the
signature diva trust me yeah it smells
like childhood whoa I like the way but
my curls are popping like it just
doesn't feel like it's defining anything
from yeah in order for my hair to not be
frizzy I have to define it like
something creamy all right I don't know
if I actually like the texture of this
at all
cuz it just feels very slimy like snot I
also don't feel like it's really
penetrating my Carl I feel like it's
just sitting on top of it I feel like
this one just defines my curl a lot more
than the other product which I like like
I think you put something underneath
first and then I think you put this over
it I feel like there's a lot less like
stray hairs and it's a hundred percent
sulfate Peregrine's silicone free
sulfate parabens silicon free Sophie
parabens silicon free so I think this is
not the product for my curl I think this
is for a different person yeah I would
say three to four to be honest yeah I
would give it a 3.5 I'd give it a 4 yeah
I'd give it a 3.5 it's a bit better than
the other one
caviar cream this looks really
okay photos real fancy I think whoever
is deciding what these products smell
like is just like on top of it all right
go ahead feels I gotta say it feels less
frizzy this section then when I put it
in I don't know this doesn't really like
detangling anything I feel like my hair
is getting naughty I do like that it's
like thick section which means you can
put this on your hair right this one's a
good go-to I feel like it's your the end
of the day and everything's kind of
frizzed out and you just want to do it
touch it yeah that's true I give it a
three point seven and I give it a four
because of the texture of it I like how
thick it is I have a little more faith
in it three and a half I'd give it a
four for me I like it I'm probably ready
for as well okay yeah I think I've rated
a fourth my favorite is the living proof
I'm gonna go to the caveat I want to
start off with and finish it off with
the Divakar
so overall I would say my favorite would
be the caviar I think it kind of does a
lot of things just for this one product
which is great I'm gonna go with diva
curl um just because as much as I did
like the caviar cream I felt like diva
curl comes through with the with the
smells and I'm a big sent person if I
was gonna use one I think it would have
to be the caviar one just cuz yeah it's
hard to find something that you can put
in dry hair did it make your hands
really soft my hands is quite soft no I
do want to say that with my friends
actually don't have that much of a
problem with it I constantly have
hairdressers coming up to me being like
I know how to get that frizz right out
and I'm like that's just the way that my
hair goes from at my head I know we all
want to control frizz who-who told this
prison was bad yeah first place if your
curl feels good then it probably looks
good too oh
put that in the t-shirt</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
