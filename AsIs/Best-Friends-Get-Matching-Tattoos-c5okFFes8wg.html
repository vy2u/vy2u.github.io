today we're getting matching tattoos
ribbon friends in 2012 we met at
Ambercrombie spiritually worked we
decided to get a tattoo together because
the best friend taking plenty of trips
together yeah we have so many memories
together and I think it's a good idea to
have that on my body does that be my
first tattoo though this is my sixth I
think yeah yeah that's either for you
yeah but I'm nervous cuz on the RHIB so
we're here at body electric today and
we're gonna talk with Ray who's a tattoo
artist we gave him like our rough
Photoshop file and he's gonna go over
that with us I'm ray Jimenez and you are
at body loves your tattoo you so we're
doing a matching tattoo today on our
ribs I think our biggest fear is how
much it's gonna hurt it's not gonna be
that bad a small burst of like
irritation but for the most part you
should be fine so you don't cry no maybe
if it's like emotional for you physical
opinion the tattoo we came up with we
designed together the basis is a Vegas
skyline because we just have so many
memories from Vegas we tweaked a little
bit of the symbols to represent our
friendship we included palm trees who's
California LA we have a ferris wheel
because we went to so many music
festivals together and we loved it yeah
we have a wolf puss we both have wolf
dogs I'll have a husky and German
Shepherd we're best friends our dogs are
good so that's pretty cool oh the Eiffel
Tower we hope to travel to Europe one
day yeah we want to travel to Europe
together and 12 for 2012 oh yeah yeah I
had noticed a couple things that needed
to be adjusted on just as some of the
landscape here moving certain things
around so that for the size that you're
gonna get it it's gonna look good for
several years ago we get all the details
dial then use a transfer paper to apply
the stencil to your body make sure you
like where it's gonna be going and then
from there get the tattoo come in set up
and do the tattoos so we'll have you
laying down just in position for that
that's you what happens if you like
accidentally
you have to let me know before before it
comes I was super excited it was gonna
be on my body forever so I'm actually
from Vegas so you are yeah I grew up
there this is a good one to do alright
yeah I'm ready
I smile and I'm saying
here
I'm almost becoming known it hurts but I
got used to the pain I'm excited to see
it do it again actually all right you're
done I'm gonna wipe you down and then
you can stand up and take a look at this
okay I did well I danced wiping down oh
my god oh I like it there we go
after a whole day it's dark outside now
as you can see I feel like in the
beginning the first like five minutes
was like the most beautiful it hurt like
really close to my stomach it feels like
hot breath they're just like scratching
you over and over again after a while
you know woman oh yeah rate was amazing
yes thank you Ray you need to feel
comfortable look glad we have this now
yeah so now we're really really bad so
