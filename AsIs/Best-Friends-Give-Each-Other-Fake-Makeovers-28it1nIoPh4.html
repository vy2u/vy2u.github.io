self-obsessed bitches it's crazy
today I'm gonna be surprising my work
BFF Ignace yeah I'm surprising my best
friend Emily I'm gonna bring in my
friend Sarah for a surprise makeover
I love everything about her like I'm she
drives me crazy but like I can tell her
that she drives me crazy she is just be
kindest sweetest human she's like the
mom of the friend group I love Sarah
because she's really obsessed with cute
things and I think that emanates when
you meet her in person
yesterday I reached out to her and I was
like leave this time available I want to
like talk to you about some stuff I'm
like you know she probably thinks I
smell like talk AIA nominated Emily
because recently she's been questioning
herself a lot and I just want to remind
her that like she's so incredibly
perfect and she doesn't have to question
her abilities in terms of her face
I know Sarah's pretty self-conscious
about touching it and she has a lot of
scratches because she's always
scratching her nose she's probably the
only one who's noticing it all the time
and that's definitely not something I
see or that anyone else sees I want this
to be a huge confidence boost what did
you do
yes right we're not getting picky big
you're gonna remove a surprise for you
do you have any idea what's going on
you're getting a makeover I think that
I'm here today because Elena just loves
me so much even though she tells me that
she can't stand me about 15 times a day
but I know deep in her cold dead heart
that she loves me so no way he's got it
like my mom so Lanie is one of my best
friends
we literally have sleepovers like we're
children together to say I'm shy is an
understatement and so like I wasn't
really like talking with anyone and I
remember Christine I just like came up
and like said hi me that meant like so
much that someone actually reached out
now Liguori are she's talking much
[Laughter]
we have a very very talented makeup
artists here yeah yeah you know work
some magic
glam me up I'm excited let's fight let's
not go sorry okay Emily are you ready
for the makeover the makeover I'm so
ready all right I'm gonna chisel those
cheeks make the lips look a little pump
okay I love all of that
the lady just calls it how it is like
I'm not actually worried that like she's
lying to me when she tells me that like
I look cute sometimes I'll send her a
meme she'll send me a meme we'll laugh
Christina is the reason why I got my
first tattoo which is huge I think that
speaks to like a bigger thing that like
Christina's made me like a little bolder
as a person and just like more willing
to try new things I have a very round
face which is not a big deal but I tend
to not take as many pictures because I
hate just like being aware of it all
right so your look is complete you look
serious are you ready to see the final
look
I think so
oh my god guys I look so good oh
you were kidding these lashes are like
so legit they actually look like normal
lashes yourself you look great
I love my makeup I'm loving the contour
line oh my gosh okay first of all my
nose oh wait is there anything different
thank you I don't do nice things for you
[Laughter]
you have nothing on your face that is
exactly how you walked in oh my god
you're very convincing like say you guys
told me that I was gonna do all these
things I was in her prime and I mean
like I still look fabulous but I don't
look like her but it's because you
already you shine brighter than Whitney
in her prime wine I hope you realize
that you're actually great at makeup and
you should stop doubting yourself and I
think so you know the point is I as this
makeovers to kind of realize it like
they're completely find us and like you
need to actually remember that when
you're stressing out I mean there's not
a new you're talking about like how you
scratch all the time yeah that's the
first thing I noticed whenever I'm
around you I see a lot of positivity in
your face which like makes me feel
better
I do know that like my face itself makes
people happy cause like I'm very
expressive whether you come to work with
your face without you
with your purple hair blue hair whatever
color you want
oh it's midnight purple I think you like
spread magic in people's lives and
you've definitely done that with mine so
she's always rooting for BAM this is
just like another example of like her
having my back when I don't have mine
Elena unfortunately she's right she is
right I am cute as is my whole aura is
just really cool yourself or something
doesn't change overnight it's always
like a work in progress and it's okay to
feel down sometimes but remember that
you are one of a kind thanks for my fake
over
[Laughter]
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
