little offended and I think I should
just leave hi I'm rad I'm Ari and we're
best friends we've been friends for six
years we met I think in seventh grade in
our math class we ended up sitting next
to each other erotica didn't really want
to study I thought that was crazy
I thought she was so rebellious that's
bad influence but it turned out she was
actually really good influence and now
we're really close friends today we're
gonna be choosing each other's prom
dresses I am really excited to see what
you're gonna choose for me if I describe
our a style I would say picture a
unicorn and then picture a unicorn
exploding onto a person and then have
Ariana's style
rad styles like very interesting like
her name is Radha Coby sometimes call
her run Jukka because she's just like so
into being grunge but I definitely think
that my ideal prom dress would be pretty
simple I definitely want to be able to
wear like whatever heels I want kind of
whatever makeup I want my ideal prom
dress would probably be like super
comfortable just because like it is a
long night but also probably like black
or blue on the darker side
I'm really excited throughout I could
pick something out for me I think it'll
be really different I'm really really
excited to see Ariana in a color that
isn't white pink or any sort of passed
out we're ready to begin
yeah bring on the dresses rads you wanna
go first of course get out
I think this is the exact type of dress
that Ariana's mother would pick out for
her daughter but I think honestly it's
time for her to get a little bit out of
her comfort zone I mean you only go to
senior prom runs
wow this would be a no way for Ariana I
don't think I have ever seen her wearing
anything black or anyway with like any
sort of artistic patterns on it I can't
even imagine her in this dress I don't
want to put her in it
but I won't be that man so I think this
is gonna be the perfect dress for all
right first of all it's a light color
since arias refuses to wear black second
it's classic it's clean and simple and
it'll be so easy for her to move around
in but most importantly her did a
stretch romantic and I think he's gonna
love it on her time to pick what RADS is
gonna wear so I think this dress is like
a maybe it's definitely less radical
styling yellow especially in middle
school this is just like a lot going on
for her I think she would not like this
at all there's like all the sequins like
she's not gonna find this comfortable
which is exactly why I'm gonna tell her
what but this is the dress we picked so
I think Veronica is really gonna love
this it's very simple on top
super comfortable like it has these
sleeves it's Navy which is nice because
she wears a lot of darker colors
I think Navy would be really pretty as
opposed to black for prom so how'd it go
should I be worried no not worried I
think I did a good job I think this is
it
first of all it's Navy which is like so
you I think the sequin it just like
makes it sequins are you okay fine I'm
sorry all right I told you the most
perfect dress get excited so first of
all I know you love strapless things so
I made sure to find a strapless dress
bloch and I think the butterflies are
like the perfect touch I think you and
your date are gonna have such a romantic
night in this dress why don't we hold it
off I was saying that like one or two
ways
you would choose yes I'm like are you
two something that's like do you not
like it look I'm a little offended and I
think I should just leave do you not
like it every fine you got me let's show
each other our dresses okay count of
three three two one oh wait it's so me
okay yeah I know I did a good job no I
love this look so good I'm sure you try
them on
yeah re are you ready for this so ready
alright three two I think already
definitely knows my color scheme very
well I maybe wear three colors everyday
and it's either like black gray navy or
occasionally like dark green so I'm
really into the color that she chose I
think this is really really simple which
is exactly what I wanted and I really
like that this feels kind of like a
strapless dress but won't have like the
issues with the strapless dress I
thought Ari would choose me like a black
dress but honestly I'm glad she didn't
and I'm getting out of my comfort zone I
thought rads would choose a brighter
color probably this one just based on
the color but I'm really happy with this
I think it looks really nice and clean I
feel so ready to go problem if you told
me problem was in like an hour
I'd be let's do it let's go I think
we're ready to go two problems I think
we have the most products perience
anyone going to prom this is definitely
been a fun kind of like bonding
experience I don't know who else I will
get the chance to do this with Emily no
one we had this together for life Brad
so you did such a good job
I'm very kind of wrong thank you so much
I can't wait to get a problem with you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
