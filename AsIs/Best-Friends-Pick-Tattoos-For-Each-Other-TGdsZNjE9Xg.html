about a year ago
Ashley had a few too many glasses of
wine and gave me total permission to
pick out a detention for do you still
trust me yeah I think I'm sweating
already once after this happens I'm
going to be really worried that Ashley
secretly doesn't like it I know where
she lives stuff I hate it has been
making fun of me and saying that it's
gonna be like a Beyonce Santa Claus this
is like the true friendship test right
yeah this is the craziest thing I think
I've ever done either way it's gonna be
a good story but there is a slight
chance that it will be a horrible tattoo
I'd be nervous but what I'm giving her
well I guess that really comes down to
your friendship with her so I wanted to
be pretty minimal pretty impressionistic
so like if you look at it it could be
multiple different things almost like
like a quilt right right there so this
is what I'm meeting Andrew so you guys
can see it to me it feels like motion
kind of looks like footsteps it a little
bit looks like a smiley face yeah it
does like it's kind of happy I'm getting
Dasia words it's your silence will not
protect you it's a quote from Audrey
Lord
she is just this like unapologetically
proud black woman and Audrey Lord was
like that to Briana is very much like a
diamond in the rough I feel like a
diamond would be a really great way to
symbolize like her beauty and who she is
she also had a dog named diamond that
she had to give up
what do you mean I can't watch this is
like the dating game
here we go
I feel like we're having a baby relax
your muscles too I really can't do that
sir
are you kind of mentally tracing what it
is I'm trying to but I can't I hate
seeing people in pain I want to vomit
but I'm not gonna vomit no don't vomit
it's not crazy
this I don't even know what this thing
is yet and it's on my body here's he
picked it now yeah I like it a lot okay
ready
oh I love it
that's something I would get but it
looks like you designed it which is
really cool thank you oh you're welcome
Oh oh my god it's so cute yeah so
detailed so I got it because I think
that you're a very beautiful person
sometimes you forget that and I wanted
it to be a little reminder that you are
a diamond in the rough and that I love
you very much
I like that a diamond in the rough and
then my god yes I'm ready one two three
okay look at it pick a mug yeah I'm
really nervous
at this point it could be anything it
could be the greatest head to ever
because I haven't looked at it oh my god
because you're nervous
this is Skinner's cat now I am because
you're not looking at it just look at it
do you hate it can we add something to
it do you want to add something to it
should've been my initials no I like it
I like oh yeah ok we are done introduce
prank to me which is the first time to
prank anyone we did it
we're still friends I'm glad that you
were my first and potentially my last
it's not like a hundred percent when I
would pick out but it's like even better
than what I would personally pick out
yeah because I'd like trust me to do I'd
never get that tattoo for myself with
like I love it for me a lot of Hillen
nervous about getting tattoos because it
lasts forever that's actually like what
makes it really really cool yeah and
there's something nice about having a
symbol of friendship that will last
forever it really strengthens your
friendship and it makes you feel like
your friend really understands you and
like what you're about and
it's crazy that you're gonna be like 81
day and look down and think about me cuz
like friends come and go but now there's
part of me forever body</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
