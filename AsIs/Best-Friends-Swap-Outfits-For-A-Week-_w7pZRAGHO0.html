best friends and we're gonna be wearing
each others clothes for the next week
we're going to be planning each other's
outfits from our own wardrobes
definitely gonna be like putting myself
outside my comfort zone a little bit
I wear clothes for men and you typically
wear clothes for a minute I've
definitely wanted to experiment a little
more with my gender expression but it's
just so much safer and a lot of ways
easier to present an emasculator way I'm
a little nervous about appearing
masculine it's something that I've
wanted to do but just haven't had the
guts to do it I'll just be getting
reactions from people who we work with
people we're friends with in addition to
posting our outfits online I think this
week is gonna be a bit of a challenge
for us but I'm looking forward to see
how much we both grow I'm starting to
get ready it's kind of just like cute
like floral blouse and a skirt which not
gonna lie makes me a little
uncomfortable I'm a little bit nervous
just cos like I don't really recognize
myself my name is Emily you like sports
this is very free-flowing not something
I'm used to this is really hard I just
walked by a guy who like yeah me oh very
lucky I'm standing up the straighter in
this outfit just kind of interesting I'm
excited to see whatever in things
oh my god
in each other you know they're a little
tight all day I keep thinking that you
and Emily switch desks I see a skirt out
of the corner of my eye and like this
floral pattern like why she keeps it to
me okay yeah you you look like every
lesbian I've ever had a crush on after
posting this I realized I look cute and
powerful in menswear
I'm currently putting on Emily's iconic
all jumper it is a little tight in the
southern region so we are heading to a
bar to meet some friends I'm excited to
see if they notice our outfits I love it
now I've seen both of these outfits on
the respective owners
wow that was why you were in a skirt
work yesterday and now it makes sense
can't just wear a skirt when I want to
totally could and some people do I was
like wow this outfit didn't really feel
masculine or feminine but I did feel
amazing shirt shoes shorts the pockets
on these shorts are gigantic that's an
entire banana in a pocket I'm kind of
surprised by help masks when I look in
an Emily outfit so I'm curious to see
what people think millennial Davy
Crockett you kinda like a lumberjack
very Brokeback Mountain nation serving
Brokeback Mountain a real house I feel a
little self-conscious in this outfit
pounding a Backstreet Boy are my socks
like should they be this high up I think
that's how men wear their socks mom you
ready it looks like a construction
worker
shut your thoughts oh my gosh I'm gonna
have it in a heartbeat I was worried I'd
look bad in men's clothing but actually
I was filling myself in this picture why
do you think I'm wearing this is gender
as a construct this is my body in a
cut-off took these shorts
I don't know how Aaron pulls this off I
feel like everything it's showing if you
want to wear this wear this any day of
the week
Hobson what do you think of my outfit I
don't think I've ever seen you wear a
graphic tee joke it takes a lot of guts
especially like I don't have a game oh
my where names clothing you know so I
think it's really cool especially to put
yourself in the shoes of another person
you know I'm not gonna lie I was really
nervous to see what reactions are get in
this post but it actually got a lot of
likes and positive comments
so I'm going to be Emily at a party and
I'm wearing her very extra skin type
party outfit aquatic party
very classic I believe but also like
he's killing it I'm both afraid and
aroused strangely honestly like I was
looking at your legs earlier and you've
gotta look better than that outfit than
me when I look at you people might think
you're weird but like you just have to
end up like pushing the red and then
you're like oh I really do this any time
there's nothing really stopping me all
right let's go party we're getting
married this week was like week Raina's
heels the stairs
I was really pleasantly surprised by how
people reacted to me this week and it
was just cool to like feel supported I
think I would wear dresses and heels
again because it was fun if it makes you
feel good put it on your body between</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
