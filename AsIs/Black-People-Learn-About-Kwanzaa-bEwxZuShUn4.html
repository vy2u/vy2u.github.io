happy Kwanzaa happy Kwanzaa to you too
thanks what is quantum so this holiday
season I decided to figure out what
caused it really is
I'm Kwanzaa you're Kwanzaa
yeah well my name is Kwanzaa but I'm not
the holiday Kwanzaa it's like I don't
also named after it I don't celebrate it
it's kind of a coincidence I mean okay
no okay um let's go figure out what
Kwanzaa really is all right
like Christmas John you're black right
yes I mean what's Kwanzaa I actually
don't know but I know I'd celebrated it
when I was younger
oh I should know this in black I
don't celebrate Kwanzaa at Christmas
I've been to five Kwanzaa celebrations
and I really don't know what went on
it's like the black version of like
Hanukkah there's candles that's all I
really know
Kwan's is a made-up holiday that black
people made up to identify with holidays
holiday celebrated in the black
community not widely in the black
community but within certain communities
within the black community meant to kind
of build up pride in the black community
and the Diaspora at large
most of my co-workers had no idea what
caused this a few surprising me so this
is what we found out Kwanzaa is
celebrated from December 26 through
January first and each day you celebrate
a new principle but not before you wake
up and you say hey man what's up or
what's the news and on the first day you
celebrate boumaaza which means unity on
the second day you celebrate
Kujichagulia which means
self-determination the third day is
Fujima which means collective word and
responsible
the fourth day is ojama which means
cooperative economics the fifth day is
near which means purpose the sixth day
is coumba which means creativity and the
seventh day is new money which means
faith each day you light a candle in the
kumara the red cent worth the struggle
the black cents for the people and the
green cents for the future and you need
cook just passed around to all the
family members and the last step is safe
for the ancestor the passed away if you
looking for don't bother to celebrate
after Christmas Kwanzaa is pretty lit
what's Kwanzaa
it's it's like unity about unity and
there's a basket</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
