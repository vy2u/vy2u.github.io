was like this from Louis black girls pre
relaxer it was the hot comb on the snow
the most dangerous weapon oh really
carry going to the hairdresser was not
fun
in a relaxer was the rites of passage as
a little black girl I begged my mom for
relaxing boys I was like well everyone
else has a relaxed day I want to wear my
hair straight so I can blow in the wind
canopy you know okay fine
mm-hmm immediately hear the song for me
it looks completely different I think
the little girls on the dress form a box
and in the gesture me commercials was
one reason I was like oh my gosh like I
need a relaxing
this looks like the staple of black hair
care in the 9000 concision
yeah it's a little it's a little watery
but it's like perfect does anybody still
use it you a few pieces are stuck in
their mind II don't really know what you
would use this for besides slicking down
your flat this this is like the
old-school version of edge control but
apparently you still I still use it okay
it's my waves be poppin I won't do you
wrong I'm a oh yeah I used to always do
people's baby here cuz I'm like oh
you're not doing it right
does it look okay did anything I don't
feel like it I don't feel like it did
blue magic I use Blue Magic so heavily
that it just you just be looking shiny
even though you put this just on your
hair your whole face is shining in the
back it says gives the hair conditioning
without being greasy this is grease
talked about though they moving yes yes
yes yes yes my mother lived and breathed
stuff after I got my relaxer I wanted it
to be flowy and beautiful I would just
take a little bit and like just put it
on there for some extra shine yep smell
the same are you ready
my old friend why I like have chills
right now this is how you know you're
getting it done by a professional
naturally when my parents did it or my
aunts didn't it was literally like touch
it on the eye of the stove touch it and
girl I remember my mom would have paper
towel and she would like put it on the
paper and it would burn the paper towel
and then she couldn't write it like what
the parts that I hated the most with
this hot comb was when they would get to
the edge before they even touched you
you up yeah the conversation around hair
has changed so much throughout the years
I'm thankful that there are a lot more
products available for us now now it's
all about like all-natural back then I
think it was all aesthetics everything I
just put all in on it and slick it back
just all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
