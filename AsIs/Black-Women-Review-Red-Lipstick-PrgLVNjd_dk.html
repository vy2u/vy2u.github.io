lipstick one night and he said that I
look like a minstrel show and that
really offended me but I just wore it
anyway because I can do what I want to
do and it look good I like red lipstick
it's so vibrant and it stands out it
makes you feel like a movie star and it
can really make you feel bold when I'm
looking for a pop of color red is
probably my go-to I think that for a
while I was very hesitant about when red
lipstick as a black woman I've been told
that red lipstick is off-limits for me
I've never personally been told that red
lipstick is off-limits
but I have her little murmurs here and
there looks like it's a bit darker than
the typical red lipstick so far I really
like this color know how I feel about
this one this is not very flattering
okay this looks lovely it's Jack I think
it's really cute with like a white
outfit okay I would be warming up to it
this is just not flattering I would not
do this to myself
but I think a compliments less can
really well I like the vibe against me
it has like the vampire sultry like I'm
about to bite you in the neck kind of
vibe see I'm already excited about this
like the brighter the red the more
excited I get this is hot and it really
stands out it's an accent bowl it's
fierce those are all additives I like to
embody in my daily life the color is so
smooth and it's just nice and bright and
much more likely and wear this one it's
not perfect but it's much better than
the other one but I just feel like a
boss like I just need a briefcase so I
could do this
but for real for me I feel like with the
red lipstick thing it all depends on the
pair of complexion
I'm just being for real you have to be
fair-skinned to get away with us so
first of all I don't take Beauty advice
from a man with a dollar signs name I
think the root of this has a lot to do
with self hate because he's very very
Brown
black people have been putting up
light-skinned women and dark-skinned
women up against each other for decades
and that needs to stop it makes me sad
that as a black man he's discouraging
black women instead of uplifting them
I would say do whatever you want it's
your body like you know the minute you
came out your mom's vagina you became
your own person if you are a confident
black woman and know that you feel
comfortable in anything that you have to
wear I challenge you to just wear
anything that may be taboo for black
women and just like document it because
by doing that you're encouraging other
black women and other black girls to
step into their own and know that like
it's possible people are always gonna be
talking people are always gonna be
saying you shouldn't do this and you
shouldn't do that but nobody can tell
you how to be you only you know how to
be you as long as you pay your taxes and
you don't kill anybody you can do
whatever you want to do wear red
lipstick do we want I don't think you
should be taking any advice from a man
with a dollar sign is in his name real
estate advice makeup advice life
coaching advice I think that the dollar
sign is a clear indication that this
person is not a credible resource</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
