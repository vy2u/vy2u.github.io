just the whole array of tones that these
companies offer I hope that stays
magical I have very high hopes
Revlon don't let me down I've always
wanted to do like a nude lip that
actually looked good the last lipsticks
we tried made us look ashy this looks
like it'll be cute mmm oh my god
I like this what like in real life like
no joke guys is really cute I would have
never even thought to try this color
even this isn't my shade
this isn't like how I would do nude I
think it was made with my skin tone in
mind I look grown and sexy true color
mangies diversity and healing that's so
cute I'm like excited to have a boo-boo
if you will don't even think about how
the default color is pale like we all
get hurt we all have to heal we all need
products to help us heal I like it it's
classy like was it that golden brown
goodness feels weird to like a band-aid
this much key time we're in bended okay
you can tell but it's whatever it's a
closer than its closer than this this
sticks out like a sore thumb there
band-aids with Barbies on them they're
band-aids with like Pikachu on them
there's no reason that there shouldn't
be more accessible band-aids with
different skin tones hey skin color bro
that's actually my skin's going hmm look
at this like Nubian skin got me on my
grown and sexy tip all right
I'm nude they found me in my sleep - the
skin graph and city to the factory and
made this frog I absolutely love this
color it looks good on my skin I just
feel one with the bra I just want to
touch myself it's kind of like a little
tight but this color is everything that
I've ever wanted let's talk about these
panties right now NSFW looks like I'm
commando but I'm not this one feels like
I am ready for the sex or just to be in
my bed and watch Netflix whichever
choice will come to me tonight I never
thought that the day would come where I
would have a hard time choosing between
like a tone difference like this I mean
even the lady on the cover I mean she
just looks like she's slaying it I've
never worn tights that match my skin as
well it just makes me want to go like
this the good thing about these is that
I would not have to shave at all which
is nice and an amazing plus because it
just looks like seamless baby soft skin
I get to walk out and just look like a
solid unit of a person instead of brown
up top and then weird pale pink at the
bottom how did you see this I mean I
know you can tell with the toe and
everything like look at all that all
blends in so I'm a little thick side you
know love it but I think in England
they're just a little bit narrower than
I am so I got a few Robins in my type I
also think I'm just not made for tight
when is this company coming to America
that's all I need to say it's nice that
there are that these products it's
wonderful and it's like one dose
Stepford chokolate man and woman kind
this honestly made me very happy this
and the bra made me so aesthetic here in
America we are
of different races ethnicities and
cultures just like any other country
maybe and I think it's super super
important that we are inclusive it's
crazy that racism is so deeply embedded
in our culture that there are
manufacturers that are willing to bypass
a whole market like the whole people of
color market to maintain that like white
is right black is more than just one
shade to that 105</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
