has been an interesting journey I'm
always picking like the second-to-last
shade and I am nowhere near the darkest
kind of black woman like I just don't
wear makeup because I can't find the
shade and because your skin is
perfect which whatever it hasn't been
that bad but I feel like that's only
because I kind of stick to pricier
makeup I don't know she's fancy I go
in-between this like I'm not light
enough but I'm not dark enough I am that
girl that will open a package of CVS any
like odissey security like a head you
know going to school in New Hampshire
growing up in Orange County like you
weren't gonna see that at CVS ever like
right in the middle of you know
Manhattan and you go into a drugstore
they may not have your shade but if you
come out but if you go to Harlem I
Brooklyn what I got they got you
Oh chocolate honey I love the names guys
really how many ways can we say
multicultural by Kanye West
oh it's coffee craze oh this is called
cognac you know what I thought point
they might as well call it Hennessy I
should be offended a little bit but also
true they're not like nude bear you know
buff it's like chocolate and black girls
just have to use it as a nude because
they don't make a note for using this is
pretty it's a pretty pink I think it
would make me look ashy and it's
definitely not I don't know I feel like
if you're much darker than us or even
maybe like a shade or two darker than us
that this one's not you got a few of
these aren't gonna work so choosing
between a bunch of boys so I'm
going to try bite in the color cognac
your approval awesome oh this she gave
me the face yeah yeah I like it it looks
really good on him I like it too it's
like just really soft and simple like
real chocolatey I say good job bite okay
so I'm gonna mix two colors I'm going to
start with bite and then I'll try to
face melted chocolate
it doesn't look bad just it's just not
about the new light is Matt Matt yeah
I'm Mike Jacobs cuz I think I'm busy
today ah it's not horrible not it's not
horrible by any means fair it looks like
something that I would not put on my
lips I'm gonna go melted honey Oh God
yeah like I feel like yours like a
pinkish peachy and this is like a
brownish peachy a toffee I think so far
is the winner it's the first one I hear
I'm actually into it I don't know I'm
afraid of big colors but also dudes
freaking me out so I don't want my lips
to look ashy but like fails it looks
really good mm-hmm like complements my
skin I'm wondering about those Marc
Jacobs the last one yeah okay Marc
Jacobs it is you know not cuz I feel
like if I got anything darker it's gonna
be like extreme dark mmm maybe you
should just try dark maybe you think
that's the only thing I need I feel like
if I go any lighter I'm gonna look
washed out if you're women of color
sticks around even though it's not gonna
say nude on the packaging because like
you know it will be your news this is
not something I would buy I'll tell you
that much
luckily we're cute so it's not like a
terrible situation yeah but I care about
you enough to not let you better and I
would let her go obviously there I guess
it's worth someone trying this out for
the shelves and seeing what they come up
with like giving it a try like getting a
variety of nude lipsticks and see if
they work
yeah I mean we both had different
results but I think it's worth trying
carry my shade</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
