we've been dating for about three years
every night she looks at these two
corgis ralph and george on instagram
what what okay if I'm having like a
weird day she will have photoshopped
them into a picture of us and send it to
me I reached out to and Brittany the
owner got back to me immediately they're
packing up the whole family driving
eight hours Becky thinks that we're
doing a couple's video over the weekend
she doesn't know is that ralph and
George are gonna be here
I'm just a little stressed I'm coming
out of it kind of like decompress from
like working I know I know it's okay I
think she had a different first
impression than I did I thought you were
fine really with that long hair it was
we got like talking it behind her ear

blue nice world and Shawn was always
like that and that's what I thought was
like the jam all right the newest video

looks okay they know they know hey
you're good come here up they're so
small oh they're so tiny
you're such big head much little body I
wrote and then they were so happy to
come down and surprise you
I was on a lot of medication after I had
surgery this passed earlier this year
and it was giving me really bad panic
attacks at night so whenever I was like
feeling like scared or nervous at night
I would just like weed your little
descriptions and I was always like
father family is so safe and so happy
and then I'd go to bed like so happy I
know I don't want this moment to ever
end you can't tell because I'm like
crying but like I'm so happy and like
not stressing I love you you know you're
gonna be thank you yeah I know you know
