same thing tomorrow
sure awesome and this is for you dear
Stephen I'm not sure you know who I am
but trust me will become well acquainted
soon enough
apologies in advance to your bedsheets
you know blood scenes are easy to clean
if you act fast for what it's worth I'm
deeply sorry I'm ready to inform you
that I will be arriving at Jen's
apartment sometime tomorrow morning well
I don't know the length of my stay I can
say that'll probably be in the range of
five to seven days and give or take
now here's the deal I don't know what it
is about me but for some reason
boyfriend's act weird when I'm in town
for example there was Marcus
he wasn't especially accommodating oh
really going to town there are you I'm
hungry I can see that what somebody's
sensitive to their exhibited some signs
of paranoia want to put some pants on I
know why I mean I just got the car
cleaned wasn't the biggest proponent of
privacy no way I'm gonna be able to go
out tonight
no you know who is on her you know what
no no her it's a period row yeah a
classic dickhead then there was Ryan
Jennifer I'm home oh my god wine and ice
cream cut these for me these are for me
always a bit dramatic during my visits
if you didn't know any better you'd
think it was his time of the month of
all weeks it had to be this week I know
you can't control it but this is
terrible timing for me what the worst
part is we can't even have sex no no we
can we can yes we can it's impossible I
suppose I was simply too much to bear
but maybe you'll be different maybe
you'll make it through the Krantz
you good yep the egg Oh name's Nicky we
kid up the acne yeah you bout ready to
go yep just give me like five minutes
the trips to the bathroom hey I'm just
gonna use the bathroom for like three to
five hours so more trips to the bathroom
the shopping and hours upon hours of
reality team coming up on Keeping Up
with the Kardashians Khloe gets to do a
scuffle just three it's serious I know
this might sound harsh but here are
three ground rules you must live by so
that you don't mess up
excuse my French I'm on my period first
and foremost never complain if you got a
problem with your girlfriend's period
you can file a complaint with the
international club of whiny little
bitches the last thing she wants to hear
is how much of an inconvenience her
period is to you number two be helpful
how you can start by picking up some
tampons for your place I'm not saying
that you need to frame the things for
all your friends to see just shove them
in that bathroom cabinet that you
haven't open since the last time you ran
out of toilet paper in the last if she
wants to have sex man up
it's gonna make her feel better it's
gonna make you feel better and if you're
worried about leakage there's these
things called towels sure you can figure
out how they work look I'm not asking
you to be my friend but trust me
accidents happen and if one does
I am going to be the best friend you've
ever had
sincerely Jen's period PS everything
they say about chocolate is true how
dude she's still on her period walking
around with a bucket under her legs
keeps wearing skirts</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
