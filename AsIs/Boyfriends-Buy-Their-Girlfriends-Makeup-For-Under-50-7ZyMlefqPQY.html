right now there's a Panda Express $50
could go a long way a Panda Express
today Chris I'm gonna pick out makeup
for me I felt pretty confident and I did
her makeup for a whole week I know they
make a few buys so we'll see this is a
long list
I'm going to pick a special occasion
look today that's what you're gonna go
with the reason I'm sort of leaning
towards day to night is because since I
don't feel super confident doing makeup
I feel like every day is also day
tonight we decided on everyday look but
I'm also gonna add in a pop of color
just throw them off we got mascara
dramatic eyeshadow
it's obviously is gonna be dramatic eye
shadow visit dramatic this powder
eyeliner bronzer blush highlighter
I don't think fifty dollars will be
enough I'm like a ninja I use my
environment to my advantage so anything
that's there anyone does there's gonna
be helping out my cause will probably do
a lot of pencil stuff more pencils cheat
oh we have similar skin tones so I think
what I'm gonna try to do is watch my
hand I see as well do it a lot and I'm
gonna use for membership cards so she
can get some points figure it out this
mall is freaking huge go check out this
place called elf because it says eyes
lips and face I found it there Sephora
the warrior has prevailed this sucks
no where the bronzer is or what the
formal bronzer to get so I managed to
cross four things off the list for 2175
I think it's pretty good a lot of this
mascara is straight up half the budget
the better than sex mascara I don't
believe it the rest of the stuff is
pretty expensive I decided to go through
and ask Angelina what's the most
important stuff on this list my budget
is $50 for seven items is it possible
okay not everything on the list are
there dupes that you recommend that are
cheaper that I could get anywhere that's
like very you so I think you should do
it can you
yeah good my lips look different I use
that scrub from lush the lip scrub and
being on top of the world hardened
expected why is the makeup so expensive
why I purchased three things off the
list and that put me in like 48 bucks I
got a dollar 69 change I'm gonna go back
to L 14 to be the cheapest France on my
man's Kris this is my secret spot not
anymore I beat you to the punch
I'll see you back at HQ I got 52 cents
left on a budget I did what I came to do
just like always I literally spent
$49.98
you said Caesar is an answer oh pretty
disappointed that I can do this this is
a lot harder than I expected
why is makeup so expensive what's
happening
that was one of your buddies calling you
one of the other guys yeah the other two
have done another time it's okay yeah
you're good
I took longer than the other two because
I spent more time in the decision-making
there's a lot more thoughts that went
through my head I mean if it was up to
Caesar I think we'd still be there
alright so I am back so we got mascara
dark lipstick foundation eyeliner and
his free sample of Rouge cream so I say
four out of seven plus a little bonus so
I got everything on the list two
lipsticks and eyeshadow palette Wow
yeah I said you wanted like a little
stick that pops have some color I didn't
want to skimp out too much on this what
else
ah you have two of these it looked good
so I bought it turns out she already has
it oh we did some swatching this one was
too matte too shiny and I think this one
was just right I do notice that there's
nothing to go on top of the foundation
you'd be focusing on the negative I did
pass the lids a pass the food court
there was a lot of temptation on my
journey but I resisted all temptation
because I'm a good dude and I got the
makeup and I got you this lip tint it's
called it started with the kiss I
thought that was cute okay so what you
spent the most money on to be clear was
a chapped
then I call you this a baked highlighter
that works and I got you this bright
idea illuminating stick what do you
think I'm digging it
I had picked the
special-occasion law I think came up
pretty damn good because our budget was
only $50 I decided to use all these
things in unconventional ways I used
this lipstick the red free sample that
you got and I just ended up kind of
swiping it across my cheekbones and then
I used your lipstick as lipstick but
also as eyeshadow it looks nice thank
you
I think she looks pretty good I don't
think she could have done it without me
I really like the eyeshadow and the
lipstick you didn't use the bomb did you
he got me too lipstick and a lip balm so
I kind of had to pick like which of the
three I was gonna use I guess my initial
reaction is I was sort of hating on what
he got just because I thought he spent
too much on a lot of inexpensive things
and he should have like done a few more
big-ticket items and then I was using
him powder that he got me and I actually
really liked it I know a good powder
when I see it I think she looks really
good
and she with the lipstick it really
pasta and looks Li nice I do like this
lipstick a lot and I had a lot of fun
with the blush that I shadow it was
surprisingly like it had good color
payoff
there was a gamble with that one but I'm
glad I worked out the eye palette it was
my favorite of all the stuff you got
after using it I feel like you did a
really good job I would say we make a
great team what you know about it I had
a good time you know I'm never one to
shy away from a challenge so I think I
did what I came to do and I made a few
friends along the way
like in any journey that you would so
shout out to Angelina
shoutout to Britney shoutouts on my lips
drivers Louisa rush yeah I had a good
day today</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
