birthday parties first control is a
godsend I'm just gonna say I have no
involvement but I do pick it up on
occasion he's picked up my pill for me a
couple times at the pharmacy when I
wasn't able to get it I know that it's
free because of her insurance for now
you've kind of told me at times if
you're on or off birth control but I'm
like I've never gone with you I've never
helped to like pick out she had the
prescription waiting and and I pop over
and grabbed it when she came home it was
waiting it was there it was long it's
just hyper dude I had my sex ed
experience and public school growing up
was pretty typical hey the pullout
method ain't a good option I know what a
basics like the popular stuff you know I
have her tell about you know crazy
different type of I just remember
this one episode of Moishe whatever mom
found her birth control pills and they
were in a circle did you learn about it
in school no they don't teach it in
school I gotta be honest I don't think
I'm gonna do that well I think Steve is
more educated than a lot of men I've
spoken to you about birth control that
being said I think he'll do 50/50 I
think he'll do great I think I think
I'll do this is your logical even still
I said I think I know how these things
work I don't know if he has done any
research on this I wish I had oh I guess
uh I guess he's gonna do
oh yes the pill that's what this is
right this looks to me like a birth
control pill boom circle yeah I mean a
circle look at that you know how much
this cost uh I do not it's got days days
on there because you want to take it
every day I think at the same time every
day basically have to take one a day
right - actually to use it completely
correctly you can't miss a day the ones
in the middle are placebo pills stops
you from ovulating randomly Oh makes it
so that you don't ovulate missing
something here
this is quite a large ring it is a
really large ring this is the one that
you keep in the freezer
probably not the NuvaRing appear to
display something about putting fuz
could have been on a sitcom is it
newberry right oh yeah yeah I took this
for maybe like six months when I was in
college I'd still venture to guess it
goes up her vagina yeah where did you
put it how do I think this is used
twisting like that
and sticking on up in there it increases
the the cervical mucus walls is it stay
in the vagina for a couple of hours
after use I would guess couple months
six months so this already contains
hormones on it you put it in there and
then the reason it's like 21 to 28 days
is because you have your period and then
you actually have to go to the pharmacy
get a new one because the hormones in
this one will run out after a month okay
so I did say with a nuvaring and then it
you know I guess I can guess myself you
should have stuck to stuck with your gut
what I did say is oh we should include
that part where I did
I love this one it's so cute it's like a
little toy damn it's hard to kind of
really figure out like what this thing
could do once it's inside there so this
is an IUD is it coated in spermicide saw
like that guys ah this block like the
uterus opening the U is definitely like
uterus or you in truck you terrorist you
to ridden device I know it goes inside
of the uterus because of the name and
fun place you do what do you mean no you
know no you have a doctor do it I just
said it word for word yeah you like that
you keep this there for the full cycle
the 20 something days or that the 30
days correct me if I'm wrong you can
keep this in for 10 to 12 years kidding
me you know I thought I got close on a
lot of these but maybe I know a little
bit less than I thought I did I would
say I'm I'm pretty shocked by how much I
knew but I'm definitely also shocked by
how much I didn't know it's also on men
to take it upon themselves if you're in
a relationship to also be the
responsible party I think it is a 50/50
thing oh I think it is very important
for guys to learn about this mainly
because in the current political climate
all of this stuff could be going away
soon so are you gonna help pay for some
my birth control now yeah I mean it to
me that that makes sense I was actually
surprised about how much I didn't know
and this is why things like Planned
Parenthood are so important it's because
it provides you with that education you
won't necessarily get otherwise you do
feel passionate about that call your
male senators tell them not to vote to
take away your rights to take away your
access to birth control
it's not just a ladies responsibility
fellas it's your responsibility too they
woke about it and be educated it'll be
ignorant</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
