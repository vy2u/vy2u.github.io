at least have eyebrows on or else you
just look sick I'm gonna at a pool party
in Las Vegas but you know you never take
each other serious until recently nobody
know might as well give her a shot might
as well we were in the same acting class
at UCB
we have common interests we both love
sports going to the beach the sweetest
thing about William here is I've never
seen him like in a bad mood it's just
weird like are you crazy I think she's
really cute that was my first impression
she has a good part positive and she's
easy to talk to and she's always
down-to-earth I've never shown Peter my
face without makeup before lots of Peter
now I want to see you Matt sure how you
came out your mother's room per se
that's like Rick
she's probably beautiful without makeup
I think pretty confident there I'm ready
ready for the challenge can you feel my
presence yes I can
where am i over here this is me this is
the reason gentlemen look looks the same
I wear makeup because I like making my
eyelashes Locker I like dressing up I
don't really know it's fun but I think I
don't think anyone needs to wear the
makeup but like I said I understand
someone like to just have fun they want
to enhance the certain features or what
not so I'm okay with that I don't want
to want anyone ever feel like she has to
put on makeup to try to please somebody
or wanted to feel insecure so that's you
not to feel secure
it's good to see here without Mako feel
a lot closer to Madison now but she's
really cute without it I think that she
needs it
and everywhere to make up again is that
