into it into how a dress I wouldn't say
I put thought into it as much as net
natural instincts we met online about uh
going on seven years now so very long
this was our seventh Valentine's Day
yeah I am excited to get rid of one of
the Nords items because it's an item
that I wish she warm why I always say
wear it and she never wears it it's time
for somebody else to wear it and give it
the the attention and the the love that
it deserves so that the world can see it
I'm really excited to get rid of
something at Karen's because it's
something that I've noticed whenever we
go out seems to be a common theme of her
complaining about this item but yet she
keeps wearing this item I'm a little bit
nervous because even though I don't wear
something a lot I still like to have it
I don't feel like I complain very much I
know you don't complain that much I'm
gonna go get the items from the closet
I'm just getting nervous I guess yeah
I'm thinking of all the things that I
really like in that closet do I have to
really watch myself every time I
complain you just hurt your feet to wear
high heels good well good bye they're
not even that tall oh it's my favorite
color part of it is it is it looks
really it's a great color on me whenever
I wear to get a lot of compliments I
wish you wore it more I've had these
shoes for a really long time they do
hurt I will admit that but I got these
for a Halloween costume when I was sexy
Little Red Riding Hood you can wear this
uh in a skirt in a dress on a plane on a
train
pantsless I mean I don't know you should
just tell me how to wear that I'd wear
it well um you know I'm telling you you
can't wear it anymore they've been the
bane of my existence since day one of
dating shoes that look like this hurt
it's just it's unnatural for a woman to
have a spiked out of her heel
it's interesting how one item that is
such a problem for me I've actually
never mentioned it till now so it's nice
to know that we should be more open
about just objects because I guess they
can help a relationship going forward I
feel like now I am inspired to wear
stuff in my closet that I normally don't
wear that is really nice it's a single
object but to me it meant it made me
feel pretty and and like he would like
me more but after six years we know how
much we love each other right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
