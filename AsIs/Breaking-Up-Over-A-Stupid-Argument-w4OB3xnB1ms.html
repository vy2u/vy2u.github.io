let me worry about that changeup here
the decorations boots should see my
thumb can read any Tom rottens are you
oh shut up
yeah I have other books
we should get a bigger bag only if I get
to pick the sheets you're gonna go get
some fresh air
sure did I ever tell you how the sky got
its stars though once was a hungry
hummingbird and it couldn't find it lose
it up which star is that that's a that's
Jupiter it's not a star really are you
sure yeah
here keep checking in it's moving faster
yeah they're stars so cool so many
planets any one of them could support
life I'll go make dinner
yeah do you think we should upgrade to a
California king no I don't know it just
sounds so much better than a regular
king are you okay the alien thing really
threw me the alien thing what you said
before about there being life on other
planets
aliens sure do you want to call them
that hey wait are you actually mad at me
I'm confused I'm confused it's just math
really and there are just people out
there look do you really think that
we're the only intelligent life out
there like like God put us here special
really
you're gonna bring God into this
are you just messing with me because I
made you take down your Star Wars poster
do you really comprehend how like huge
the universe is and it's still growing
it's growing what how do you really want
to know I guess not
don't even care about that I just
figured we were the only people like
maybe there's some bacteria out there
okay that's a start it's just a stupid
thing to argue about
I agree why even think about it it's
such a bizarre thing and it won't even
be proven in our lifetime it's like a
thing that completely doesn't matter I
like to think about things me too real
things what do you think it's
egotistical to assume that we're the
only smart life out there like what
makes humans so special so now I'm
egotistical goddamnit you just think
you're so much better and smarter than
everyone okay well what about in the
opposite perspective what about things
smaller than us could I have an entire
universe in a marble in my pocket are
you mocking me with a minute black
reference what scanning electron
microscopes already disproven it anyway
 you okay I don't want to fight with
you about this all right I'd rather save
that for something more important like
whether or not we should vaccinate our
children or whether you like adventure
vacations or lounging vacation
vaccinating and lounging duh so it's
just this stupid thing that you insist
on okay can we agree to disagree on
whether or not there's intelligent life
elsewhere in the universe
honestly I don't know we literally look
at the world or universe or whatever
differently I mean every time I look at
you I'm gonna think you're off in your
own world considering the universe it's
just math everything must seem so small
to you fine
huh it would take such a crazy
confluence of events to create life
elsewhere you know it's a huge long shot
that it happened once much less ever
again did you just compromise one of
your core metaphysical beliefs just to
get out of an art you met with me
yes I did
just Google Kepler for 38b</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
