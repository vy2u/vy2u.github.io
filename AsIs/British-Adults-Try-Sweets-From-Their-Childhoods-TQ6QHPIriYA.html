now they don't because it's like they
don't want kids to want to smoke I feel
cool now I haven't understand ever done
this before mum no I do then they look
so lame now that you are 20 I live a
hollow smells brutal the packaging you
sell spider-man on it and sometimes you
get a tattoo I'm online oh my god that
pineapple flavor but they don't have any
pineapple in them at all I have no
memories of income flow no question is
what flavor did you think they were I
remember enjoying them and I'm starting
to think I was lying to myself it
flattered the NBA why is it like a thing
to eat things with faces what are you
teaching about cannibalism because all
of the people are they always winking
there's like a boy BM BM you can realize
he does one a Netflix and chill his
first bite that you taken to them and it
like breaks everywhere if it looks like
something that you would find at the end
of your bed at night and have complete
nightmares about the ends are the
milites emoji yeah without a face that's
just this you know that brings no joy
there used to be limp cardboard because
the sweetshop was down and I think the
little licorice used to pop out the top
two and it used to be all yellow however
the exercise would be rolling in your
hands to get the show but to come out it
was very unsanitary actually it looks
like a cat that's been rolled in the cat
litter dance I don't remember anyone in
my class liking licorice licorice makes
you doesn't it this has some sense
of disappoint you so heavily this was
like the playground rumor they would
turn you orange that was like the big
news in year four there was a Florida
flavor in California flavors and the
Florida flavor is the best flavor you
had the time to call it Sunny Delight it
was always Sunny D I remember it coming
in like like big gallon cartons which
you immense pour into glasses being you
were too busy smuggling the down garden
yeah that's disappointing no I remember
it being more thick much less chemically
it's kind of the same flavor but it
feels like the flavor has been turned
down quite a lot
I blame Jamie Oliver honestly blame
Jamie Oliver the reason why all of our
stuff was like so sweet and so nice and
so tasty it's because we didn't have to
 out to do except for eat this
the kids still eat that stuff I feel
sorry that kids are today will not have
what we have
