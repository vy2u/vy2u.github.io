dark-skinned rob you of romance if I can
describe how mainstream society views
dark-skinned women it would be ugly
different dirty unwanted I did not feel
beautiful growing up I think I've never
felt pretty and it's probably because I
am dark-skinned I remember I had someone
who came up to me and called me burnt
skin I think a lot of girls want to be
pretty whether they would admit it or
not and it's always been an effort to
make me lighter to make me prettier and
that's never that's never actually
successfully happened when I was younger
I didn't even know they liked skin
bleaching creams existed my mom started
giving me creams I think third grade and
then I finally stopped before middle
school started because my skin started
peeling off I'd burn or at worst I get
cancer or anything and I couldn't play
sports I couldn't go in the Sun I
couldn't do normal daytime activities
because we had to make me fair
I've used ambi before this was not
drastic enough Bayes dark spots for even
natural skin tone my entire face is a
dark spot oh this seems so innocent they
have brown in it but they're like
telling you dumpy ground now like go
from this to this this is called
diamante I don't like how pretty this
one is what are these
I'm helic of you this is like pastels
what if I wonder mice getting white like
right now this would take forever
there's a woman one here with a before
and after picture but the woman doesn't
even look that much lighter maybe this
will help you think twice he just like
you know what I'm just gonna stay black
cuz it's too much like that I have to do
perfect white that's what this is called
come on are you kidding me it seems like
an SNL joke I can't believe it's called
perfect wait it's kind of super on the
nose like a weird way to shame people it
has an exclamation point it is perfect
it's basically trying to have you wipe
out your essence of who you are skin
beautifying body oil so it's already
telling you that you'll be more
beautiful with your life this one is so
interesting because it says formulated
for people of color the difference is
clear ha ha ha for better skin tone and
a lighter brighter complexion clinically
proven to be safe and effective either
all lies
now when I look in the mirror I see a
young black girl who has worked super
hard to understand why people act the
way they do when it comes to black
people in general I'm happy I'm dark I
wouldn't want to be any other color so
I'm going through the period of being
like comfortable itself and I think that
right now I'm seeing something I'm
pretty comfortable with I see myself
obviously but I also see kind of like
the women behind me who allowed me to be
where I am
I feel like brown girls we're given this
exterior because were warriors and we're
supposed to fight off everything that's
thrown at us
this is our armor this is our shield and
we have a lot of battles to fight but we
have the backbone to do so I don't see
what's wrong with brown or dark or black
like there's nothing wrong with it
that's just something that's like Todd
don't be so hard on yourself oh my god
don't be so hard on yourself from my
perspective I would describe a little
darker skin as lucky fearless
beautiful unique I'm so lucky that I'm
brown</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
