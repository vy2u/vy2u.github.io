Sephora came up with to get us to buy
more shit like fingers are fine as long
as you ain't sticking them in weird
places before you cut your face right
today we're trying Beauty blenders
versus foundation brushes don't write me
code how guess I'm going blender cuz you
can blender I feel like a brush things
more sturdy and it's like gonna go over
your face more whenever I use the sponge
it's a lot more smooth I'm so old-school
that this to me is just like getting a
new phone like I don't want that new
phone I don't want the new headphones
like I want my shit that I'm used to
I've heard nothing but great things so
I'm excited to see what miracles this
thing does
my minor in college was art I feel like
I just like holding paintbrushes this is
a nice brush yeah I mean it better be
for $28 okay I mean the brush is
definitely quicker when it comes to just
getting in the little area really like
how smooth this is going on right now
it's very calming and the coverage is
good I mean I'd like to go through with
a Beauty Blender and gather up some of
these spots but yeah the coverage is
full I see you oh yeah really good yeah
what I'm used to we like good yeah I am
I'm fan I'm not mad about this the times
I I really use a brush it's usually
weird and streaky but this one isn't too
bad now it's time for my favorite the
Beauty Blender okay teach me all right
you can still do the same thing and then
just dip dab dab on them the only thing
is that I feel like it takes a little
bit longer to apply because I'm not like
brushing or stroking my face I don't
like hitting myself in the face multiple
times in a row the Beauty Blender to me
like it's just not I'm just old school I
need to change my ways I know but I like
brushes I think that it's soaked into
the skin better with the blender maybe
because there's like more surface area
so I'm gonna still say I like the beauty
blender this side with the brush gives
me a lot more coverage I feel like the
brush gets the job done whereas the
Beauty Blender is more of a like
smoother finish I've been using the
Beauty Blender for a while now so would
you go Beauty Blender you don't go bad
but let me say this there is no right or
wrong way to do your makeup nobody gives
a fine so if you want to put on your
makeup with a paint brush and like some
sticks and leaves go ahead and do that
as long as you look good at the end of
the day that's all that matters breasts
job and done
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
