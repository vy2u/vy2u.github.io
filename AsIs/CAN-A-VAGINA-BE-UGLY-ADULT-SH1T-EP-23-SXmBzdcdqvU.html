is P cool try to think of something fun
that happened today and it turns out
this is hard alone Oh someone's shutting
the door it's just the ghost
shut the door oh God
okay let's let's think here what did I
do
they finished shutting it okay what did
I do this weekend oh my god I have
nothing to talk about on my own oh my
own pretending you use B so you guys
like lateness I do
I sure do I think it's one of the
saddest musicals
Wow I was just starting to talk about
lame is your Justin dies haha thank God
cuz you would have gone that rent and
that would have lasted for ever wow I
didn't actually time cuz I freaked you
out the second you walked away I was
like what the do I have to talk
about I don't know how people podcast on
their own
I was thinking about that I was like
Marc Maron really must like he loved
Santana so yeah but like because you
have to like hearing yourself talk to a
certain degree even but then you also
like he's so jokingly miserable but yeah
he hates being around himself but he has
to do it twice a week every week anyways
that poop was cut a little short you
prairie dog I I did because it's I
didn't for like two and a half days
I was on vacay
and I told what don't say vacay I was on
vacay ah this sounds like something you
would say first of all no we're on
vacation
is wait at one of the like the first day
I met you I probably took a in
front of you but there's something about
like the person you're having sex with
it kind of takes a while it's weird
though cuz they've been closer to your
holes way closer to my holes
I think they should appreciate them for
all they do it's me again I their bow oh
my god I don't know if he has maybe
maybe i it's not something I love I'm
not gonna shave people that liked either
butthole looked to me it's like I will
never not think I'm gonna on
someone's face I just watched a Sex in
the City and they were talking about
butthole licking what they have to say
about it do you agree with Miranda
running for governor oh dude don't ask
me politics okay
that's not what this show about even
talk about it don't you I don't
know oh also guys yes we lost our
microphones this week so we've been
trying but here's the thing
oh sorry guys sorry we miss listen wait
so tell me what they said about butthole
liking on Sex in the City
oh right Miranda was shocked by it and
then
oh really Miranda you look like someone
who needs their butthole legs I mean she
softened up to it hey uh but Charlotte
was the was the surprise into it but
liking if you haven't watched fixed I
feel like our generation was the last
group of like girls to really watch it
yeah yeah it's cuz our moms and like
older sisters maybe watched it if you're
younger and you haven't watched Sex in
the City
it's great oh it's still applicable
there's a late you know there's a lot of
old-timey there's a little there's a
couple problematic things just like
anything anything 90s and 80s if you
like show last week that I said is
probably problematic like we're just
we're moving forward which is great
you're an adult and we suck up so that
they don't have to yeah our show is this
week by the times about that oh you did

was dressed really nice and I was like
I'll talk to you whatever it is look her
beers on me have another 100 fun they're

first class but he but I didn't actually
ask that but yeah he gave me his card he
said to call him call him when I got
back to LA did you call him what do you
think of course not
I made the DJ buy us first class yes on
your way back here yeah I made him do it
because Valium and love and let me tell
you it was the worst first class mail
I'd ever had in my life this is a
champagne problem I understand that but
let me just tell you what they gave us
get ready to not relate with an
explanation you you're literally paying
for like amenities essentially like okay
for like a better seat better food
better experience right potentially
sitting next to someone gorge your
future husband uh-huh is that what
you're losing I was gonna say Tara Reid
oh she was on the first-class slay when
Cantor and I came back from a read flies
first class Virgin Airlines yeah I was
on Friday
long story uh this food they gave us
walnuts mm-hmm
pita bread mm-hmm dried chicken that was
it it was virgin not yeah it was like it
wasn't you heat it up it looks like I
could see the lady in the back opening
up the like peanut packets and dumping
on the plates and I was just like oh man
I hope that's not our food because I was
very drunk and very tired and all I on
valium
yeah bare hands I am huh that that's my
unrelatable experience from this weekend
all those double protein it was called
the protein plate and I was like oh no I
already out to cuz I'm chipped in
two days but um we should talk about our
our contest quick question you could
kind of say me what does the DJ hate me
now
why would the teacher hate you cuz I
blew up this bar for messaging me kill
now in a fight oh my god we gotten our
first like a real fight we've gotten in
a fight before but it's like yeah this
one was like beyond this was like
screaming match fight well and I hate
I literally I cry when I get mad like
I've never been someone that knows how
to fight and I kept saying okay I'm like
I don't know how to fight you're doing
fine the guys I want to be that I'm
fighting but my boyfriend you
piece of asshole over here I
know you're listening in the middle of
Kate and I spike nobody else's business
 Instagram messaged her and I
don't even know what he said he said
something like I hate that you guys are
fighting if you could he said beefing I
was so mad and messaged her and was like
if you want to talk like here's my
number and while that was good intention
it was like absolutely so out of place
and even though it was like I get now
why he did it and sure maybe one day
I'll thank him but it was just like it
was like someone put in their their
ladle in your soup when stirring it when
it's not your soup to drink maybe then
he doesn't hear you by the way if
anything he would have thought you hated
him probably no in holes in no ayah
issues I liked immediately in my phone I
was like and I heard appreciate it if
your boyfriend didn't reach out
to me that mr. grand I was like what and
so that I thought that maybe he was like
re bitch I was trying to help no I I was
a beautifully I would see what happened
was I was walking back and forth but
behind this wall so he was on the other
side of the wall and he could like hear
me yelling he was like I was I'm gonna
go over there bother you but as soon as
he said that he said my head just goes
it was like what okay like I was so
scared
I was like good you should have been um
but we're fine now and we're friendships
have up and downs we have fights man
yeah you gotta work through them I think
as someone who like always didn't have
female friendships like close ones
that's why I'm I I just shut down and I
go well if it's you we don't even
need to do the podcast we don't even
need to be friends I'd rather just not
do anything at all and I'm easy to cut
it out of my life cuz I
know how to like sit and talk about
feelings right yeah I mean it's hard
it's hard to talk about stuff when
you're like oh I didn't think I did this
thing or whatever I don't know it's
fights are hard yeah they're necessary
well I just wanted to make sure because
it might be uncomfortable travel
arrangements up here oh my god no he
true he doesn't give a okay like he
was genuinely worried I mean cuz so much
a lot of people commented on last week's
episode being like wise Kate being
passive-aggressive why is she yelling at
Kelsey really yeah I didn't think of
anything of it and when I was editing it
but I think people thought that I was
talking about something personal and you
were being like not sensitive I don't
know and I've been I was being
sensitive and I was just I was steering
the conversation back to you I don't
care I talk about myself too much I'm
constantly well comments there on

yellow write for Teen Vogue like pretty
regularly I write for Playboy written
for HuffPost and Cosmo and L like have
all over the plane your
Instagram is my favorite because this
 is so like you're the
biggest balls of anyone I know
gonna be like live Instagram updating a
first date she's on how much a douche
bag the guy is being like taking polls
on if she should see him again or like
still let him eat her or like
people think I'm no filter but you truly
like you live your life based on like
yeah complete like Instagram polls he
yeah I've definitely had guys like I've
come back from the bathroom and they've
already like known me from social major
or whatever like I disconnect my social
media from like my dating profile so
like people don't really know but it
looks a lot of times they do anyways and
they'll be like hey I just saw you
posted a video saying that I was an
asshole in the back so the guy saw me
like I said I'm just it's watching it's
like watching the best kind of reality
is ever like watch out though they've
always just been like they've either
tried to redeem themselves
oh that's good you know which is good or
be like well what did I do and I was
like oh well like you said reverse
racism was a bad thing yeah I think
you're a dick let's talk about yeah do
you I mean is dating when you are going
out and you're dating is that like how
do you not talk about your job because
your job is selling yeah I mean it's the
only thing that's like okay so I haven't
actually gone on a date in like four
months which means I also haven't gotten
laid in four months
great connected to the lab but that's a
huge part of it is because my job is so
political and my job is so activist
based and and I do so much work like
about like violence against females and
and rape culture and stuff and so that's
like not super fun date um and guys have
a tendency to get kind of like I hate
being like guys are intimidated but like
a lot of times they really are and I'm
really sick of doing it like here's the
intro to me and you're gonna ask me the
exact same 57 million questions you're
gonna expect me to teach you about
feminism right and like I'm not here to
be your teacher I'm not here to do that
I've been here to go on a date and like
please stop asking and you also we
should mention I think we maybe talked
about it on the bottom in the early
weeks you had this incredible what would
you call it art show yeah an exhibition
called the dick pic show yes for this
election of dick pan or who who went
Freddie and I went a judge ah yeah yeah
you also know a lot of BuzzFeed there I
wanted to go I wasn't it
I literally Instagram for the day of and
was like hey I want to come to your show
I hate doing this but I'm gonna use that
little blue check as my advantage like I
didn't know you yes I have a mess but
you can definitely yeah I was like I
love dicks love tanks don't love them
together and less they're consensual but
can I come to your show tell us about
what that was and how you were inspired
to do something like that because I feel
like it needs to be a traveling art yes
so that was actually a third one we've
done we've been to three cities already
and so it's like you're a girl that's
Owen Wilson um it's 200 unsolicited dick
pics and me like often really aggressive
and threatening messages that like come
with that stuff which I call you ladies
know about yep and set up inside like a
full gallery space it's like an entire
woman's home so bedroom bathroom living
room kitchen everything but the walls
are just lined with like hundreds of
dicks like terrible messages like
calling you an evil Clinton yeah um and
then there to basically show how like
invasive digital harassment is and then
there's a full day of like educational
panels and we've had people like Shirley
Manson and jasmine was on a panel and a
bunch of other incredible people and a
whole day of sex ed workshops a bar DJ
is a pop-up shop from my store yeah it's
basically like a whole little traveling
some of this festival and this there's
also a wall of dicks like a wall of
hanging deals that had the photo booth
yeah what I got jealous of like I wanted
to be surrounded by dude I had two
interns literally hanging up dildos for
I kid you not like twelve hours in the
middle of the night different let you
own this this confident this is you were
like when you say you have interns so
you have a whole staff women or clear
people at nine another
and everyone is like queer it's all
women mm-hmm I'm not opposed to hiring
other folks I just yeah drop my boy yes
 like when you're talking about dick
pics and you're talking about feminism
you're talking about rape culture
talking about white privilege all day
you want people who really share those
values that's what I was gonna ask you
about is how do you be in white how do
you like not lean into white feminism
because I feel like I've seen a lot of
people there's like a weird way that
roots great but there's like a trend now
of being like a feminist but I'll sit
and which is again great it all needs to
happen but there is that's a lot of
times not inclusive and like black women
and have been saying stuff for eat your
forever forever and I think feminism was
founded by white women and it has always
been centering the voices of white women
and a lot of people of color feel like
the movement is just not for them and
that's like completely accurate most of
the time and not all white women who are
feminists are white feminists but women
white women who only Center their own
voices white women who only tell their
own stories who think that they are at
the bottom of the oppression girl just
because they're women that's white
feminism yeah and I think I try to
combat that all the time I talk about
race constantly I talk about my
privilege constantly and privilege isn't
a bad thing I just have inherent
privilege based on like who I was born
to and where I was born and I talk about
the fact that I don't know everything
and I you need to defer to women of
color to trans women who know more about
oppression who can teach you things and
when they tell you you're maybe doing
something wrong or you're saying
something insensitive even if you think
you're like the whoa kiss girl at the
party you do need to take a step back
and recognize that like you're probably
not right because you don't know like
what a man is like telling trying to
explain feminism right and you want to
be like oh yeah that's what it can
that's what we can sound like to women
of colors of that I think Kate said
something wonderful ones on the podcast
where she was talking about if you're if
you're feminism
an intersectional you're on the right
you're on the wrong side of the right
movement and I think people for some
reason especially white women obviously
and white men have an issue with
admitting privilege is an okay thing to
have or they'll come up I heard
somewhere you'll be like well I mean I
wasn't raised rich it's like yeah that
is not even telling you please like I
have ramen noodles before it's like yeah
like yeah like I struggled in it all of
a sudden if you admit that you have
privilege that they're afraid that that
is admitting something like they're
racist or they have racist tendencies or
their family is racist right and people
are afraid I mean it that that just it's
a recognition it's not a bad it's not a
bad thing you can't control your
privilege and it's it you put a lot of
what I find is a lot of times people are
like but I worked really hard for what I
have or like but all my accomplishments
are my own and I'm like I want to do it
look we're not privileged doesn't mean
you haven't worked harder that your
accomplishments aren't yours it just
means that like certain aspects of your
life have been intrinsically easier just
based on what you look like more based
on like what socio-economic bracket you
were born into yeah it just you start on
third base but you think I'm starting
like at first and it's just yeah it's
not a horrible thing you just have to
acknowledge it and then try to use your
privilege to like amplify the voices of
people who don't have a much it's so
interesting to you cuz I feel like a lot
of times talking about it I've noticed
with people who are like well I I'm not
very sister I'm not this or whatever I
think a I'm gonna get for this but
I think if you're white you are raised
white in a predominantly white area you
have you are racist I say this all
the time and I yell that kinda it's not
see it doesn't mean someone wasn't
talking about it the other day I think
it was a stand up or something like that
but about how like you any sort of
preconceived idea of what another
culture is and a judgement based off of
that is racist it doesn't necessarily
mean like I'm not even not like true you
know like outward violent racism is
racism but also there's small parts are
very regretful yeah and like because we
were raised with this kid in color or
whatever our privilege is in that
specific I mean are like yeah I'm gonna
think racist thing sometimes I might say
something racist sometimes that doesn't
not even I know an inherently terrible
racist
being it just means that like I was
raised with this certain lens of the
world yeah I have to sit in that and
unlearn this a lot of unlearning
and I think that's like what I've
learned is such a hard thing for people
to be like oh I've been wrong or Oh like
I know a lot of times like I remember
trying to explain to my dad why locker
room talk isn't just locker room talk
yeah and it's I think that sometimes
like the the weight of reality for
people who haven't really fell to that
reality is too much yeah it's it's so
much the air about it can't possibly be
true ya know you have to be making this
up because it just doesn't compute it's
like how could someone be suffering this
much without us knowing and that's an
area a lot of people are they're saying
well it's dying out like that generation
is gonna be gone soon but what they
don't realize is like hey we live in a
bubble here in these metropolis cities
where we are you know in echo chambers
all day long but that these people have
children who are still very much
ingrained and in the whole system and in
the church system but even just that
like maybe like the moreover like right
wing version of racing either
transphobia homophobia but like even
within our liberal media everywhere
this is pervasive we live in an
inherently racist country it was founded
on racism that's not gonna go away in a
generation that's not worse it was my
mind still like even now I think I've
become a little bit more cognizant of it
cuz it's been happening my whole life
but even in media even in like Hollywood
that's supposed to be this like woke you
know groundbreaking we're like letting
women do things now yeah we're letting
like people of color play people of
color in their own stories like yeah
we're doing something right here yet
they still will have like a very it's
all stereotypes tell it's like okay we
got a black panther but it's also like
let's take a step back and look at that
black panther was created by white
producers with a white production like
company behind it and like yes they
would kind of feel like they were like
given Black Panther it was like okay
well here we'll give you like your black
movie Michael but it has a production
company
but then it's like you don't it's where
the funding good it's where the funding
has her it's where this the studio execs
and it's all that and then it's like you
know you don't there's no like Asian
movie and also it's like never has there
been a white or like oh that's just for
white fun right like they have it work
everyone's expected to adhere or to like
listen to the stories of white people
and like maybe we'll Dean to go watch
the black lips yeah it doesn't go both
ways it is alarming to think about how
many white men are profiting off of
Black Panther so okay this is all very
important conversation and what I think
we also need to talk about we have a fan
question that is also an important
subject
and I figured we would save it are you
it's a little hard but still very
important because this is not the first
email I've gotten like this but I just
can't wait to hear all of the comments
based off of what we just said Oh like
yeah like trying to not look at the
comments I get so much every single you
do you want to learn from someone
without costing them emotional labor
about how to deal with trolls you guys
really should go look at Whitney's
Instagram cuz she handles it I think you
 do it way more than you have to
and should have to but I actually been
like lifting the out of that about you I
do everything why I have really been
like you need to yeah step out I think
you handle it really well and you do it
and in a very good way that I don't know
how it taxes you emotionally but I know
at least from someone who's so learning
how to deal with this stuff even though
I've been on the internet for like over
ten years you do a really good job but
the title of this episode I think it's
gonna be called do you have an ugly
vagina
alrighty email this week is titled ugly
labia
hello ladies love the podcast I am 19
and very insecure about my vulva
especially my big saggy Schley be
ellipse in color I am a virgin but my
vulva puts me off having casual sex
previously with time with previous times
with guys I would lie I was on my period
or keep it covered with my pants
overall rushing anything sexual which
sucks I've seen two of my friends both
seen their vaginas both are cute and
 any vulvas and when I bring up
the subject
vagina types they don't really care for
it so what should I do what's your take
on vulva types and what do your guy
friends say another thing is sometime
yang the guys I go with are usually any
experienced meaning they have seen less
 causing me to be more
self-conscious should I wait till I'm in
a relationship which I don't want at the
moment or just have sex with the guy he
complains Budiman hope he doesn't tell
others about my different genitals ah
sad face PS see the labia library
offered no comfort as I know guys are
dicks and talk about behind my back
thanks xxx
first of all which got a lot labia yeah
which one's the labia yes question
labia minora and your labia majora and
like a big lips Aurora utterly labia
minora or the inner leg wait I pulled up
a picture of the machine thank y'all
small so that's your labia majora and
that's resumen I'm trying to find it
very that's about it what what is that
it's probably like no that's HIV Jenny
yeah we just googled vagina on Google so
that's what we got so they it's usually
referred to as the lips yeah um and I do
think we live in a culture first of all
thank you for writing that in because
this is not the only email I've gotten
asking about this subject now I'm glad
Whitney's here to talk about a little
bit more just because I'm at though so
we're merch has vaginas on it it's a lot
of vagina um I do think we live in a
culture in America specifically where
our porn stars
can only have one certain looking type
of vagina which is where men are
learning about sex and smoke a lot of
girls are two locations
no you're right you're right and so when
a woman watches porn and then looks down
and sees her vagina dud or her boobs or
her body or her hair or whatever but
specifically her vagina doesn't look
like what they see in porn all of a
sudden it's not desirable and I just
want to say a vagina is skin and anyone
is lucky to be a round of Aegina
in the first place they want to be there
if they want to be there and if you want
them to be there there's no wrong vagina
and lastly
it's hurting then you should go see a
doctor but there's no wrong looking for
giant I like it is not in this diagram
it's just the one little dot and that
says anus but also bottles all bottles
of different - - and also I have like a
larger labia and I freaked out the way
that this girl is especially what she's
missing 19 I also like was so
self-conscious about it I'd only had
text a couple times and I was just like
I don't want to show anyone this and
then as I like sort of got a little bit
older and started like being more
sexually active and being more confident
alright this is my vagina deal
with it guys are so into it they just
want to be near a vagina do you care if
there's some guy was like oh you don't
want to be with your iron like any long
wouldn't longer ones be like a little
bit more like myself because that and
like but like if you're okay so like it
doesn't always have feeling in it it's
not I mean even for like for expert like
if they're if you aren't choosing to
have sex with a guy and then if the if
it was just like this and tight it right
and then this is the bigger labia that
it's just sort of an extra little who it
could be
listen it it also can change like the
shape of your vagina can change I
remember when I was younger I had what
they call in any vagina and then I swear
to God I think this is what it was I
would always masturbate the same way
with my left leg bent up a little bit so
a lot of the pressure was on the right
side so then eventually as I started to
get older my right side of my vagina got
bigger than my left side so I got a
lopsided ass vagina and guess what not
once not number has someone gone down on
me and God who guys get into your vagina
they're not like you know it let me
challenge I mine and again if they do
they're horrible yeah but I it's also
just like that's not the thing that
anyone's thinking about like when
they're about to have sex with you
exactly like my feel about it later like
right like I've had sex with people then
like later been like oh wow they're you
know dick tilted a certain way
- genitals have like a weird thing like
genitals inherently are not just this
like glorious perfect thing yeah it's
perfect one diamond it's it's a perfect
like in a glass case in a glass case and
nobody can get it not even being a key
but I think I I do understand where the
insecurity comes from because we are
conditioned to think that a vagina
should only look one way and that where
can we see other vaginas like ours well
when you're young clitoris on Instagram
so clitoris I think that's what that's
called yeah yeah yeah Club clitoris book
club clitoris I think that's what it is
I smell clitoris like this market
Instagram and this girl takes
submissions yeah this is that she takes
submissions look out look out different
all these vaginas oh this is it this is
it this is it this is it look at her arm
so anybody submissions from people like
you can send her photos of your vagina
and then she will sketch them and draw
them and it's every kind of vagina with
every kind of body hair and every kind
of labor and every skin color as she
does trans folks like it's amazing and
it really helped me with a lot of my
like sort of vagina insecurities and
yeah that's them all up really people I
will say I have there have been times
were like I you know swapped photos with
a lover or two of myself and I've taken
a picture and just gone like oh god that
does not look good like I've spent time
with my leg up on the sink a certain way
or an angle or a lighting or going
switching an outfit because it my
looked ugly and I didn't like it and I
got insecure and then ended up not
sending it because I just thought well
it looks like but here's the thing
I think Dixie Vijaya is kind of ugly
they just are funky marketing genitals
are just like by nature like got a weird
thing like sir it's not like them but
I'm also like don't like from a
completely objective aesthetic
perspective it's like not the best yeah
I think to like when I whenever I've
seen other like women's vaginas who have
vaginas I it's it's cool to see one
that's not like mine like I'm like oh
wow I didn't know a vagina could do that
or look this way Kate you look very
uncomfortable I'm just trying to figure
out like I wonder if it's just after you
get like particularly sexually active
that that's when you're like oh I can
appreciate this picture of this
genitalia but for me I would just prefer
like a couple words of affirmation that
would turn me on like hey I think you're
really great like your pussy's really
good your pussy's great or
personality you know stuff like that I
would just be really into but that's
just right now you know that's still I
mean I hear both like I it definitely
took a long time to be comfortable with
like the aesthetic of it and like hello
I just got lasered so like obviously
think you know obviously like I still
have some things I want to do but with
my body in general that would make me
feel better but it's never for someone
else which I would like totally steer
away from anyone who's ever like thought
about doing the vaginoplasty because
yeah so you know I got the Barbie No
yeah it's called the Barbie and by the
way Barbie doesn't have genitals so we
shouldn't be calling it surgery
it's specific for aesthetic purposes it
has nothing to do with like the medical
side of it so in real details realize
you you can make sex works for you it
can make it not be your clip works what
is vaginoplasty if i go in they cut it
off to make it look like a little porn
star baby tiny that's like a baby vagina
only if you want to wait I thought about
this other day man if you want to
someone who wants you to look younger
though you should only that process
a little you sure what okay the
guys as you get older they should want
labias that touch the floor or or they
should at least appreciate you like that
vagina is aged that's Aegina is young
yeah not young girls do still have a
vagina like yeah that's the thing is
it's not a lot of people are like oh
whoa like that's a loose vagina or like
oh she must have had sex with a lot of
people or oh she's older some people
literally don't have a tight house
vaginas were it's not even about your
muscles just felt like how much skin you
have it's like a bear and then obviously
other things can contribute to it but
you can just have that Lydia and and I
did it and I I used to like fully shapes
like full Brazil like everything when I
was younger and I felt so uncomfortable
and like so naked and some women love
being totally shaved
I just didn't and then when I finally
look when I got a little bit older and
got more comfortable and I started not
shaving like oh you know clean up the
side something the bottom but like it
yeah there are only a bush there yeah
and I finally was like oh this is what
my vagina looks like and everyone can
have like what their vagina looks like
and like you just need to find your knee
say was I think step one is that we all
need to maybe become a little bit more
comfortable with our own vaginas like
you know when you're a kid I first sure
sat in front of a mirror and just stared
at it for like an hour being like well
what is this do what is this deal what
if I push that what if I touched us and
I think if you're at an age where like
sex is happening for the first time or
you're trying to discover your sexuality
I think it would do everybody a little
bit of good to first get really
comfortable with enclosed you don't have
to love it you don't have to love every
part of your body but I think especially
if you've got a vagina give up close
with it touch yes see what things do
assessing things though that there are
people so I am uncomfortable yeah and if
you've been through some sort of trauma
when you were younger it might be hard
for you to leave ever Aegina and be like
this is mine I want to pay a lot of
attention to it so there's also no rush
no I want to say that in case like it's
just different for everybody I feel like
feminism doesn't necessarily mean I
adore my free time you know I have this
relationship with with this right again
this is my just like yes is what are
really yes if this is what it looks like
I remember like really not wanting to
like I just I wouldn't even I avoided it
and like I wouldn't even clean it really
which is pretty like bad that's bad for
common with women to them yeah
tiya to be sexual with ourselves like
boys are taught about masturbation the
fact that pee I need to do it they need
to have this really yeah they're taught
that they can look at poor and they're
taught like all of these things are okay
but masturbation for girls are like
being in touch with your sexuality or
knowing what you like or what you don't
like is not a thing we're only Todd's
like how to get out of sex yeah I'll
avoid it how to stay safe that's what
girls are taught about sighs yeah that's
all I was yeah and if you want to see
like some more diverse vaginas important
and you want to see some more diverse
bodies in porn um check out Erica lush
she's on there oh yeah I went to
Barcelona I am
I just went to her screen right about
her 14th oh isn't she the bag
he's the freak doubtful I wonder who she
said listen to that episode was like who
is this wonderful woman she's amazing in
her work is like you said like really a
favorite it's really important I was
thinking while you were talking about
like the the trauma thing to like I
didn't have any childhood sexual trauma
that I'm aware of but I definitely still
even to this day feel really
uncomfortable with a guy going down on
me and I like can't make eye contact
with them like I don't know how to look
for them in the eyes well they're done
even though I'm the most like a lot much
buzzing I think everyone should
experience that I still have a really
hard time letting someone else be that
physically close to it like intimate
emotionally I have no problem with that
but like the physical closeness of like
difficulty but now they're seeing like
do you feel differently when a girl
roasts on either yeah guy goes down that
ah thousand percent I have never once
felt insecure when a woman goes down oh
my god because we're taught that like
we're supposed to be like clean and neat
and perfect for men like we're taught
that like their sexual satisfaction is
supposed to come before our sexual
satisfaction we're taught that like our
vaginas are like smelly and like like a
vagina should smell it should be
smelling like there is a problem yeah
like go to the doctor bacterias yeast
that's a place that's so normal I think
it's really interesting that with girls
you don't have that same hang up because
I just know that they're cooler because
they also have a vagina yeah but like I
don't know any dudes that are like yeah
I'm just like really self-conscious when
a girl wants to suck my dick like I
don't even want her to go there like
that is in oh man yeah but the prolific
see with which that happens is not equal
to that of women and that's not saying
that like dudes don't feel insecure
because they have the pressures about
having a certain type of dick that looks
a certain type of way but it does
definitely feel like it's skews towards
the women having the press
to aesthetically be a like confident and
also have like a pretty it's also
like dress well and also be skinny and
also can be the cool girl I need a
thousand tees burgers but wait a hundred
yeah I think that's something to be said
about how important it is to get
comfortable with this sort of stuff so
that we know that it actually doesn't
matter what your genitals are not
necessarily like you know what they look
like so if my if my you know with labia
or whatever it is
bulbous or you know whatever is there
could be another woman who doesn't have
a vagina you know what I mean and she's
it's just about the person and what
their their pleasure is it doesn't meant
it's that can be really frustrating and
wanting to have certain things and you
know whatever I totally understand that
but I also think that realistically
especially now moving forward like and
people being more like vocal and
understanding about trans and non-binary
and everything I feel like that is
something that it just means that this
person has these this is what turns this
person on this is what if you're in a
sexual you know thing with in a sexual
relationship with this human being you
just here's what I have here's what I
want let it do this you know people and
not as Janet is important part about you
and if someone wants have sex with you
they're having sex with whatever yeah
it's there and it's the harming sex with
you as a person like yeah atomically
maybe yes penis vagina that's we all
know that's not how people have sex you
know that's not what considered is
considered the only way to have sex
anymore and it this is a time you know
going back to the the girl asking the
question I understand that like 19 is a
very scary time because you know you are
kind of figuring out your sexuality your
hormones are going crazy off the wall
and you can feel really insecure about
looks and in whatever way it is whether
it's your face your vagina your bottle
whatever but it's I hate to be like but
think about like who you are as a person
cuz like you walk it's like that
it's scary I want to
I care about what people think about the
way I look at oh man but I can promise
that at 19 years old if your
other 19 year olds or 20 year olds
they're just so happy to be faking
they're probably in a blind stupor and
they won't even honestly this might make
you feel better they're not even gonna
notice yeah I really don't even think I
feel like they're just gonna be like a
whole it's so I think her big fear it
sounds like here is that she would be
hooking up with someone a guy and they
would stop the intercourse or whatever
the hooking up because of the aesthetic
of her vagina and I just in I just can
never happen after today it hasn't
happened to me but my friend in college
she like I understand this fear like she
she hooked up with this guy and he was
an asshole the guy was a known animal
but for whatever reason we're attracted
to assholes so she hooked up with him
and then I think she either didn't want
to do it again or maybe there was some
sort of like I don't know like they
weren't going to nursing I'm gonna get
some water but he told other people that
she had a weird vagina oh okay well here
the drink makes you look bad test that
guy is a dick wants to walk out of sex
with you because they don't like the way
that your genitals look then like it's a
you learned early but I do understand
the humor stand that now that guy who
maybe is going and telling everyone that
you have a weird vagina or like what
happened to your friend oh did your
loony see you sneezing what is happening
to you oh I do understand that like that
guy may be the popular guy who you know
people are gonna listen to him because
he's having sex and and the other dudes
aren't so I do understand why there is a
fear around that and it might be
traumatizing to you now in high school
but I promise you the universe and the
Karma that will come back to those guys
who were assholes like they are so far
behind in the world and with sex and it
might be
and it they might be glorified now but I
promise you like you're saying you're
gonna learn early and it's hard to be
away from that now and see that how much
it won't matter and how much
these guys don't get it or
matter but it's the truth like they are
gonna they're wrong it used okay if you
were to like okay if you were just sit
down at a restaurant I don't know why
this is my beer I love cake it's about a
bar says you're a restaurant and you and
someone else order the same thing right
you order like salad right and then
you're eating you're like is well you
know this is one of my favorite
restaurants I'm so excited the other
person was like the salad looks a little
weird I'm not going to eat it so they
look oh and you're just wouldn't it be
so much hotter if someone was
like yeah whatever like and I'm
just gonna eat it and enjoy the taste
and enjoy all the way the steering's of
the whole or other than judge someone
just look like yeah but you know I love
your metaphors cake they're always a
spot on and right also food and sex are
very similar yeah it isn't what I do are
there I do it okay so to our listener
who wrote in that question I guess
wrapping up all I can say is to me what
it sounds like with just a specific
instance it sounds like in my my advice
would be to just look at it more love it
more fine more porn that has diverse
pussies that's my first step for you
yeah yeah yeah anybody else just I can't
just the same advice we're gonna give to
anybody about any like issues their
self-confidence they have with
themselves is like just try to like
accept and love yourself because it's so
much more attractive mmm when somebody
is confident it like doesn't you know
like someone can be a nothing most
beautiful person or like have weird
genitals but if you like are meeting
yourself with like love and acceptance
and confidence that like other people
are going to
yeah and also oh it's always to read
into it a little bit more um trying to
figure out what it is if it's just if
it's just what your vagina looks like
fine but is there some other feeling
about insecurity here is there something
else that's making you feel this way
that makes you maybe not want to have
sex right now is there something yeah
else and it's just because I promise I
promise it's not that like no no one who
you want to be is going to be
like no thank you and I like what you
said Kate about the timeline like there
really is no age that like all of a
sudden you have to love your
because I love my in some days I
still I'm so insecure about it and and
it will Evan flow well listen or watch
