what is Kate's nickname get your
stickers get your stickers what's your
name you know Michelle
yeah thanks for coming hell yeah okay
hello judge so what we were talking
about before Kelsey's gonna have to take
the reins on this because I know Lee my
time to shop
I was literally just facetiming with the
DJ backstage I don't know how much I
could talk about your relationship that
you've told me keep it open for everyone
to hear that's why I do a podcast yeah
you guys are really into blowjobs well I
am yeah I guess he is - there was no
need to blow time I'm sorry third guy in
here who's like I could take a bleep
please we can't we can't just bleep
everyone in the ring on your hand if
you're a human identifying male and said
I could take or leave a blowjob
no one's gonna resent
Tilghman nobody blow him ever never
second pick anyone here ever I'm
around so I was talking to everybody
suck his dick after we'll put a lot of
benefit around everyone else you're
acting like me stop it I've drank I know
we can tell good for you that's what
we're here for
we were talking to the DJ backstage and
yes that guy and I asked I was like how
are my blowjobs home he said top three
yeah he did wait first she said she goes
is it top ten he goes mmm I'd say top
three which means the third like what
other two blowjobs
but I have a bionic jaw okay I've had
jaw surgery literally 75% of my face is
made out of titanium
I don't quit baby no gag reflex watch
this nothing
holy and you're me you've
had to to not want to better
blowjobs than that no way that's right I
think here's the place he was like uh
maybe there will be two better one day
Kate why would you put that insecurity
in my head anyway I don't know if you're
the best cuz that's like in Napoleon
Dynamite where he's like to do meet
everybody at employment and it was like
he's like you couldn't possibly know
that you know what I mean no I don't I
don't understand snow polian dynamite
you don't what is it a classic is a
 classic I don't have to explain
myself to you ho Wow thank you
and I agree so how do you give if you
were to tell someone who maybe doesn't
know not me but if it was not nobody was
like I don't know about blow jobs what
would you do okay here are my tips
forgiving dope blow jobs blue like doing
it if you don't like doing it
don't and do it don't pretend you
like sucking dick if you don't want to
suck a dick it's not like one of those
fake it till you make it situations you
got it you got it you know when I say
don't pretend you say suck a dick don't
pretend that works thank you guys
I feel like there's so much power what
are the odds
okay so you have to like it right and
then here's tip number two baby coming
in hot if you like it
you gotta love it you got to
pretend like that is your god damn
day job because the more you're into it
buddy
if you like it wouldn't you just love it
then I had a dream about it cuz like I
don't give a like I'd if you like
you wouldn't you just love it know what
some people are like oh I'll do it
because like that doesn't mean like it
that when I say I like McDonald's I'm
like I'll do it cuz I have to
I like it I'm like McDonald's fake mac
bitch I think you can also if you like
it you can learn to love it you just
gotta find the right dick for you to
love it so that you're talking about
that love has to be the relationship no
no no no baby I have suck some dick
without any love involved you ever being
a dick when you're like he's not gonna
call me tomorrow he doesn't care watch
this I make them fall in love based
on this blowjob that's how a part of it
so love has to be a part of it on one
side there's no way you're gonna be like
look at this fleshy weird thing that's
sometimes soft and sometimes this and
like you've seen it I have seen it twice
how dare you dare you goddamn dare you
it you have to love the person to love
their sale absolutely not
you have to love the act of it and we
get a vote yeah all right who thinks
you're easy in love to give a great
blowjob to want to live you all just
like sucking dick oh we got hoes raise
your hand
y'all are scared I do want to explain
myself out there and everyone else is
holding back well we're just getting
started rolling 13 minutes in oh no we
haven't
we're out we're out of time nothing
there is something recent that I learned
about the dick and I've known dick okay
I've been around it for quite some time
but you know what there's always
something more to learn about it and I
learned something new about that dick I
call it the tube system I don't have any
graphics but if I did this would be a
dick okay okay this is a dick I don't
tell them what it might be so pretend
this is the dick you have a pen here's
the balls just don't have a pen they're
a little more lopsided than usual
so right here's the dick right a big
ball it's - it's a who
okay that's about to the shore nailed it
okay so that's two balls right so here's
the devil back bitch
the sorry I don't know why I
said I like that to come the come comes
from here yeah are there any families
and the building you got kids in the
house get in the house it should have
given a warning yeah it comes from here
and it has to get all the way to here
that's what he's going blue and I
thought my whole life I thought it just
came right up the middle of the deck oh
no no no no no where is it gonna know my
friend there's a tube that
condors a dick it's under the dick just
like a when you go to Jiffy Lube and
they take your car they move it it's
under they raise up to help you yeah
that's why guys like jerk off like this
getting the tooth it's wish you on the
tube yes I'm the bottom of the dick not
the middle so if you're gonna give a
blowjob and goo for the - well yeah that
is another tip as I think like you can
actually help push it out of the tube
drink has there been a bad blowjob in
here yeah alright so me Rochelle its
Michelle Michelle stand up Michelle what
I want to hear it well maybe have been
the problem I am for the solution as I
say what happened about it's not about
blowjobs or is it it's before you're out
nice love it when it happens you turn
that into a positive guess what you dick
and you then you turn that you hock a
loogie hock a loogie on that dick you
can't quote me you your uncle ooh you
gotta use more spit no that's a blonde
that's a that's a hot blonde thing to
say I can't hock a loogie on a dick and
someone be like you let me buy you a
bagel sandwich tomorrow if I hock a
loogie on a dick you gonna be like I
need you to call your own lift home and
pay me back for the to Budweiser
I'm glad we're using that's it spit is
important sure
you know what else is important using
the hands oh yeah that's what I heard I
don't think we utilized the hands enough
can I get another fat daddy who are you
talking to he's having a side
conversation with your friend me up Oh
middle of our podcast yeah you could
edit it out here's the thing
TLC does honest-to-god 90% of the work
I'm joking aren't you what I just show
up she edits it she does the sale but
can't we all agree that we can't do this
without Kate batts to blow jobs back to
go oh wait here's the thing what thinks
if there's so many people who are like
oh cool blow jobs but here's the thing I
haven't really met a dick that didn't
just like shoot off what it needed to do
every dick is a loaded gun it's good to
go you touch it in the right spot is
like wow and it's like that's too much
those are too many bullets there are -
there's one target you don't need to
fire five streaming bullets what about
munchin bucks hmm I love munch a box
that's harder I think everyone here
could really well fluid we've all talked
we've talked about it on the podcast
like everyone should at least eat vagina
once before they die why even if you're
straight you should try it and
make sure you don't want to do it like
the same way you should your
friends just to make sure they're your
friends not fit you know like I don't
know this is pointed no it's worked out
this fun no it had but you have to eat
you have to box at least once in your
life yeah and it's also it's healthy for
you it tastes nice like again if you're
into it and you act you don't have to
act like you love it if you just love it
it tastes good
go for it go ahead trivia question are
we doing a question we're doing another
merchant was what was on the jacket
kills he was wearing when she into
it Taylor yeah Mr Price what shirt give
her a hat do you need a hat here give
her this one okay also fun fact one is
three times by me very unflattering only
where it's a bad BuzzFeed wouldn't give
us merch here you go my sweet baby angel
I asked for merch for the show and they
were like no no and we were like let's
go into our closet and we just pulled so
some of these items have been gently
worn yeah by myself were coat so when it
comes to eating or better I did I
assume you've had more practice so tell
me what do you know that why do you
suppose you drink bitch who's better at
eating me we know it's me it's her
we know it's Louie
we haven't actually checked should we
there's no way every bad guys this real
fast and just handle it I keep trying
with the ear she won't hook up with me
like sometimes you gotta your
friends to just know that your dude
they're your friends no I know we doing
this whole podcast thing going I don't
trust you like that let me go down on
you know why because I think you you
demand a lot of things and I think you
would Dimpy was talking about I just
think that you would be like I did this
for 20 minutes and I'd be like yeah it
didn't work and you'd be like then
you're broken first of all I think you'd
eat me like a bro a bro that didn't see
the rate that I don't know my way around
a puss yeah are you really so you really
don't think wait wait you smiling at
that form we're looking at the same
audience I know they're on my side
I know how to eat a box when people look
like me in the world they know how to do
things actually when people look like
you in the world they're just like I'll
just like ask somebody I'll be like I
love you so much I love you oh my are we
gonna have our second fight right here
right now we got a big-ass fight we're
like bleeding they're like this is not
the show I came for you and your
boyfriend are gorgeous I'm wondering if
you you're complimenting me cuz you just
insulted me by saying I can t put ya all
right it worked back onboard
Oh accidentally licked the mic I think
we we should talk about though the best
way to ask for head because I think a
lot will get either like men just expect
it right they do the head push
you know about the head boys they always
do the like I have to go pick up my
roommate they they have to go then they
leave right everybody everybody relates
to that but like women I feel like if we
have to ask then they should have to ask
and if they don't then we shouldn't have
to I think I think there's a wait
remember what what do you remember when
little Kim bet her fame on the tables
turning and that she went away forever
what the does that have to do with
it Christina Aguilera's are you just
like what the tables about to turn I bet
my fame on it cats take my ideas and put
their name on it it's a right though you
can't hold me down I got to eat
but then she disappeared then she was
gone cuz the tables never turned so I
think that we should just change it cuz
like a lot of times I won't medically
the idea of like having sex with the
dude because I'm like mmm I'm good on
suck on that dick like I don't know you
I don't want it if I don't know you I'm
not putting anything in my mouth you
don't deserve it you didn't earn it if
you bought me one clap for that if you
bought me one simple IPA I don't give a
 your IPAs are now Spencer you
better believe I'm not cradling your
balls we're both getting something I get
nothing from that what what about what
what do you say he's right about the
blue minute he wants to eat your bloomin
onion you calling your vagina a bloomin
are you waiting my vagina to a Chili's
appetizer Outback are you acquainted we
were gonna get married bitch we
rebel number one it's bad I'm number one
you thank you Mary Jonah a bloomin onion
and it's ringing
don't blue bonanni he doesn't get dipped
in ranch did you just call your vagina
Atlantis yeah
that's your boyfriend that's my future
baby hand just talk to him like that I
wouldn't start out so smooth with your
love Wow
am I wrong no nailed it so how would you
ask someone to go down on you if you
need if you didn't want to just like
outright be like hey will you eat my
vagina out for a little while
how would you ask I just go home alone
no that's not no that's not how it works
I I've never asked they just did it
though that's that's one way eat my
 does anyone else have another way
the partially shaved heads to just ask
eat my yeah yeah I'm listen
I'm all the way into you I'm buying
whatever she's selling yeah oh
we got another suggestion yes don't run
around but that is running around bye
that if I'm like hooking up with someone
and I'm like let's not run around let's
be straightforward
whoo I want to hear what you say right
now what is a good example of being
straightforward he just gestured he was
like wait no no wait hold on the guy in
the red right in front of the guy who
asked you the question I've heard him
say he loves Ian black so why would a
girl have to say what did he say that he
said it before oh do you know him
is this your friends my friend but he
hasn't he in mind but go ahead what
would you say are you sure the way you
said that I I didn't forget you why say
anything you would just do it
realistically though is it weird to ask
no it's not right raise your hand if
it's weird to ask forehead but like yeah
but nobody know like if you want someone
to go down on you and they're nice
everybody don't get them to do it
teach him to just do it you just
push their it but that's what
guys do that to us and I hate
that I don't want to do to them
what they do to us
well this has become an open forum ah
merge give away okay we got the prize
first can you have that box it's a bag
okay does anyone confuse this for a box
give me this yes so drunk full
all right oh this is a good one
this is a cap slap hat then I cross the
name out on the back and just wrote
Kelsey in case she crossed our apps lap
and just said Kelsey and then we also
signed it in caps lab sign it I signed
it in then Katie your mom you're gonna
do boots
okay so okay the question is what did
deeply shut up you shut up this is a
this is a you gotta be listening from
the beginning from episode 1 this is an
episode 1 question the girl at the back
just went like she hasn't been listening
like okay what did Kate text back to the
guy that said her the dick-pic that
started the whole podcast Brooke what
that's a good dick don't throw it at her
younggook come here give me a hug
all right back to blowjobs this is my
favorite subject so stop trying to steer
away how do you give constructive
criticism when someone ate eaten Depp to
us right what would you do if someone
was like I don't know like biting it
like like okay we're biting it you know
like eating cheese like how do you make
it stop has that happened to you know if
it was happening to me and probably just
be like oh oh no you would say oh no
yeah then I'd be like maybe one don't
you try it like honestly
honest to god if we were if we were like
in his head was right there I'm a pretty
short torso I just move his head yeah
okay I'd take a hold it hold this right
Curtis I just be like oh you know break
his neck if it breaks it breaks I'm not
gonna try I what I would do is I would
maybe I would just and I would say hey
this is what I like I really like it
when you do and then you make it think
like it was their idea you know how you
do that in business meetings where when
you want something you make them think
it was their idea yeah you just
you you trick them into eating it right
or her eat him or her right has anyone
had a disastrous blowjob story we
already asked that remember Michelle
raised her hand and she said she's game
we said there you go problem solved I
just wanted to tell mine again let's
talk about the thing I sculpted his dick
but he lives in Philly still who should
I tell her real quick they've heard it
right right when I put gold bun on that
guy's day you guys heard that podcast
yeah she thought it was Lube and she ate
me out and then he's like return the
favor said return the favor
no I don't remember what he said I was
very drunk but I was like I imagine lube
and I thought he said lotion and I put
that sweet sweet Gold Bond medicated on
that normal dick and it was exploded
into flames
he lives in Philly what do you think I
could Syrian Potter yeah bitch I'm
always in your was I was that where is
why isn't he here tonight I mean he's
probably scared of me all right how do
you prep the place for going down you
don't right believe that no cuz like
after the curb which we're all going to
we all come home and like you have to do
that weird like excuse dance to the
bathroom where you then have to give
yourself a whole bath on just your vag
lips and hope that that takes away the
sweat smell which it's not gonna
do we all know that so then you start
going with your outfit be like do they
have some deodorant in here but then
what if he goes down on me and then my
on your leg is deodorant and then he's
like wow this smells like something
familiar maybe I like you or maybe it's
because it's what I wear on my armpit
and then it tastes like walking around
with deodorant on your puss but
here's the other thing if so move over
to monitor books I'm just laughing at
the idea of it how many every people in
here are trimmed shaved and ready to go
wait trim shaved and
are three different things are you
trimmed are you shaved or are you ready
to go any combination of the three all
of us all of us should be not me bitch
oh natural I could brave that I
feel I could hang a plant from that
I get up I get a bigger size of
underwear because my food here is just
that thick don't you hate it when your
 pubes get caught in your
underwear and it like catches and then
your stop dead in your tracks
cuz you're just like oh no I hate when
it gets caught in your toilet paper and
then you're like what the- ply toilet
paper are you using anyone wait I might
be on unwell might be using toilet paper
incorrectly this entire time
front to back yeah yeah yeah yeah I'm
gonna need a confirmation yeah okay
sometimes it just it arose because it
arose in water and then I just gets your
sweet sweet buzz your toilet paper
should never be a roading what
aluminum strings toilet paper do you use
like four ply it feels nice my company
is my buddy from high toilet paper raise
your hand if you were grown with one why
your boyfriend y'all are listening all
right don't I like how on our notes
it just says what is the protocol for
Nutting genuine question what is what
were we talking about us are okay
because here's the thing if you guys
listen to past podcast you know that
when I told my blowjob story I was like
yeah yeah do it in my mouth and then I
didn't no one told me because Cosmo was
like they liked it and then when I was
actually doing it was like no one
 told me how long it takes for
them to finish nothing
don't say no hahaha it's like a
 stream it's like if you were to
lift up a hose not all of them are like
it's not on why does it keep Shh
I don't know dribbles out like a sad
tear I know the thing is you all know
what I'm talking the second you I don't
think there's more you're like and so my
question is what's the protocol where do
you nut do you nut what in the mail
visit on the gist where is it I think
it's up to who's ever giving the blowjob
like if you're the one sucking the dick
you get to choose where than not though
but you always feel comfortable saying
where it goes yeah sometimes I got that
 I'm like today I would like goes on
the wall and you it's like an a
cadet I would like to say again you
started being sexually active at a very
young age
I am Catholic things happen differently
I think also too and this is there
there's not a lot of dudes in here but
for them and they're all like married or
in super relationships but I think it's
not Sam not Sam Sam I don't trust you
anymore you call my vagina a bloomin
onion I take it as a compliment I don't
look at your son together and you just
did this you did this to me I think if
you're the dude who's Nutting you have
to do the and you know what I'm talking
about
where I'm gonna come you gotta give that
little head tab go to cook you have to
tell us when you're gonna come
cuz then we can roll out we could shoot
it against the wall look at one company
he is get furlough you're so comfortable
I just think that it's it's definitely
that you have to say you're gonna cut
that's protocol right you say you're
interesting got a lid on yeah even as
chicks you say when you're gonna come
yeah no someone's shaking their head no
I feel like so many girls are like we've
tried or are we just out here not coming
cuz I will have your nun photos oh
you're gonna come I could stop or I'll
just go like really hard and
ruin everything it's so I why do they do
that I
the immediate tension after we talk
about this being like you shouldn't talk
about this and it's like what dudes
dudes talk about literally jerking off
and coming everywhere all the
time
yeah we're all here for that we're all
here for it I just feel like I've gotten
a little bit of pushback quite honestly

we do to uplift ourselves he's like get
away I truly I watched the office and I
my favorite show he just said he hates
the office y'all assholes okay okay it's
an acquired taste 30 rock is also very
good Parks and Rec space so if you're
not watching those shows my advice would
be and I'm not joking masturbate it
feels really good yeah and you can do
whenever you and Jill I could kiss J I
ll that's hilarious your name is
dick Jill but it feels really good and
it does it releases chemicals and your
brain that makes you feel good so any
time you're sad hungover anxious
sometimes I'm having a panic attack the
only thing that cures it besides valium
it's masturbating yep I would say hey I
really like entertainment and television
and movies and stuff to like take me
away from stuff so whatever you're into
go ahead and look that up what what kind
of actual entertainment are you into
whoo what's do you want to give me your
email address and I can send you a free
blue apron oh yeah give lacy your email
and I'll send you a free blue and red we
want ya oh sure you get it don't be a
dick pin beautiful we love you thank you
I'd hug you but you're over there who's
got another question right there she
raised her what's your name and if you
were gonna be an octopus which leg would
you want also one through eight are you
out of your gourd you have great skin
go ahead what's your name my name is
Carson my Kirsten Kirsten like curse
Kirsten like the American Girl doll I
would want to be the left like one of
the first one through four of the left
yeah one through four on the left side -
nice that's a good one
what's your question doc how do I tell
my parents I'm gained a relationship for
nine months I'm first of all amazing
congratulations
who's your girlfriend who's your
girlfriend the one who came up before
she has her hands up okay cool
Oh what kind of a parent have dad kind
of okay mom he took my aunt that I was
gay without me telling my mom about to
ask right now is gonna sound very cold
and I don't mean it how long have you
had this haircut since February that's
nice how old are you are you living with
them are you close with them you know
what I gotta be honest with you I got to
be like a hundred percent honest if you
haven't told my parents that I'm
bisexual because I'm not dating anybody
so it's not like like I'm not gonna go
home and be like oh I'll you know what I
mean like I like whatever but if you
have a person that you really like think
of your ability to love something or
someone you have any pets or anything
like that yeah
two pets do you love them who's a yeah
like I know it sound I know it sounds
crazy it sounds insane but like I have a
cat I love him we know he Pete but the
idea of like when you if I live a pet
that much imagine how I would feel about
a human being give your parents a little
bit of credit expect maybe to expect the
worst so that you don't get hurt but I
would just say you just do it you love
the person that you're with and talk to
them very is simply and just be like I
love you guys so much I hope this
doesn't change anything you know what I
mean it's really all right yeah cuz I
feel I feel actually like a dick telling
you what to do because I haven't done it
to my parents you know what I mean
yeah but I think if they love you
they'll love you regardless I think
actually a parent's love is much more
than we think it is as a child yeah yeah
I think they'll love you regardless I am
lucky that I have two very like liberal
parents who are just the most accepting
people but there was a time where I was
worried about friends finding out
because of what they thought and I
realized that like again you know your
situation better than anyone and you
know them better than anyone you don't
really owe them anything and you also
don't have to do anything like unless
you if you feel ready and you
want to then you know that feeling
better than anyone else like you no
one's gonna be able to convince you
otherwise right but you don't feel like
you have to do anything because it's
your life and it's your story
and how you tell it and how you want to
come out is totally up to you and I
understand it's very much also like this
is who I am
yeah I want them to know there's a very
real part of you that's like there's
this whole half of me that's just ignore
it and like they raised you and you love
the fact that they did all of these
things for you so I would say like I
know like my my parents are really
Catholic like they're very very
religious and I think that the root
cause of it is fear and
there's no love like a love for a child
and I think that that could really
prevail over most fear and it's stupid
but like show them like YouTube clips
I don't know that really helped me with
kind of like a like coming out and
accepting what I was feeling was valid
and and seeing other people like me and
I I think I said it on one of the
podcasts where I was like oh well if you
don't really know about like the gender
spectrum watch this weird Katie Couric
documentary that came out on Netflix
because like parents really identify
with Katie Couric so I don't know if
there's I love Katie yours always email
Katie Couric asked her it's really if
you can find someone that maybe like
your parents can identify with or like
is their age or like their that they
would understand that you could also
show them like look and yeah thing that
they can like grasp onto right because
they can be like my dad would always be
like I don't understand it but I support
it and I'm like no I want you to also
understand that like I want to you to
sit down and look and like have a
conversation with me about it so I think
a way that they can relate would maybe
also help but also like your mom knew
you before you were even a human being
like your mom felt your heart beat your
mom knew when you were moving your mom
knew all of these things about you it
sounds like she knows I'm not trying to
make you cry but your mom loves you to a
point where you might not even realize
how much she loves you and it's it
sounds like she knows is right like she
felt your heart beat yeah but like where
you were out she murdered you are saying
that she told your aunt that you were
out and so it sounds like she may be
knows your and she won't protect you
that you're worried about mom will
protect you yeah and if they're together
and like I feel like you know if it's
easier to do one at a time yeah yeah my
dad I don't know that I ever had like a
full blown-out conversation with my dad
about it I think my mom just
told him where he like saw it on
Instagram and hears like right but
honestly you'll feel I would assume that
you would feel a whole lot better when
everyone's just on the same page yeah
yeah we hope you
let us know how I got we gotta give you
something
thank you oh yeah wait oh how about we
have one more question
well we are wait we have how many shirts
