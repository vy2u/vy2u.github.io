of the word feminist whether it's Katy
Perry Beyonce Emma Watson that word
isn't a pop culture discussion at the
moment the question I'm wondering is can
a man be a feminist and if so are we
even welcome I decided to ask men on the
streets of Los Angeles one question you
consider yourself a feminist um I don't
I don't consider myself a feminist
because you know I'm masculine are you a
feminist no what do you mean mother said
not at all okay hey you look media man
this guy's funny I trade females equal
to males so I don't really feel that I
need to be Pro female and putting
females ahead of males No
why not I'm not a woman now I'm sure
you're probably thinking that I edited
this down that not everyone I asked
answered no but you'd be wrong every
single male either said no or was unsure
what feminism even meant so I decided to
speak with dr. Juliet Williams professor
at UCLA's Department of Gender Studies a
central message of feminism from the
very start has been that gender
inequality and the gender system as a
whole isn't just bad for women it's very
bad for men too it saddles men and women
with so many limiting stereotypes
whether it's for women the idea that you
have to be pretty and
early and shy and quiet or for men this
idea that in order to have social value
you have to be aggressive and
competitive and angry and all these
expectations that we now know cause so
much suffering I've seen young men
suffering from mental illness unable to
ask for help for fear it would make them
less of a men or less of a man this is a
movement that is by for and about women
but it's also very much something that
men are welcome to participate in and in
fact that we need every one man woman
fish I cook but to be on board with
those how can we affect change in the
world when only half of it is invited or
feel welcomed to participate in the
conversation men I would like to take
this opportunity to extend your formal
invitation
being a like straight cisgender man and
not identifying as feminists is an
incredibly fragile state of being to be
in I decided to ask some of my friends
who are feminists what exactly being a
feminist means to them traditional
masculinity is very dehumanizing to men
it sort of paints us as impervious
emotionless strong hearty creatures I
understand why some guys would see
feminism as being intruding to their
masculinity but I've never really
identified with traditional masculinity
I my parents are - psychology majors I
have three sisters I love I have an
amazing mother and then a great
relationship with wonderful woman and
besides that like it's just no it's
mean I keep saying that but not honestly
like it should it should be such a
non-issue my grandmother passed away and
my mother passed away they were such a
huge example not just to lead as a woman
but like as a person as you know being
compassionate and being understanding
being a listener feminism allows men to
admit weakness and insecurity and sort
of like give ourselves some slack off of
this totally unrealistic standard of
masculinity that we've presented so
you're saying that that absolutely can
be feminists and it should be I am
saying that edit super-surprising when
they're not</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
