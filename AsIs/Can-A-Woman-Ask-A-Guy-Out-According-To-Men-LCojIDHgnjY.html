women but we're just programmed to say
that we don't so let's break that down
usually I ask out the women I'm I'm
interested in but typically yes I'd say
I probably don't ask most of the women
that I'm interested in out in my
experience I always ask I'm a pro I'm
like at this point I'm like a veteran of
asking women out
I don't remember of any woman never
asking me out I've had girls like sort
of telling me that they like me first
and for some reason I don't know why it
was weird I think a lot of guys don't
necessarily expect it even though a lot
of guys are very much down for it maybe
just the type of girls I go for but
mostly girls I go for it expect me pass
in my opinion if a girl was to ask me
out that's pretty much her saying you
took too long so I'm gonna have to do it
I mean women kind of drop hints you know
I mean it's it's kind of weird thing to
me I wish like you just be like let's
just go out and I'd be 10 times more
likely to buy your nice or dinner I
wouldn't feel that way I wouldn't feel
uncomfortable if a girl asked me out
it's a major turn-on for me when she
said that she liked me I felt like I was
turned off more that it was too soon I'm
sure gone by composed women who know who
they are and know what they want so I
guess it's a turn-on if they ask you out
but I mean no it's like if a woman
you're not attracted to a CEO that's a
turn-off definitely a turn-off I would
love it if I were to ask now I would
never say no because her girls asking I
would say no because I'm just not into
you yeah everything's acceptable except
hurting other people or treating people
like they're different because of who
they are
I think if women asked me out I'd feel
more like a boss I wouldn't feel like
less of a man or anything I think they
can do it like nothing stopping them
from doing it I don't
that it happens as often because of the
past let's just get rid of all of this
pretense about who's supposed to pursue
boo and just go after the person that
we're attracted to</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
