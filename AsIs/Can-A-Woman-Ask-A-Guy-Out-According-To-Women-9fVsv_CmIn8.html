someone that I liked them first one of
my ex-boyfriends I saw him in a bar
walked up to him and went you I will
have you and then we were together for a
year now
I guess I typically have my experiences
it's been the guy asking me out I'm
always the one to ask the guy out fer I
think it's 50/50 especially if the guy's
introverted I've literally never waited
for the guy I like to ask me up I'm just
way too impatient like an animal call
you like um I think it's just kind of
giving more attention to that guy okay
we should hang out sometime what time I
should I come over and give you the
business touchy more flirty and then
obviously with alcohol it's like let me
just touch you everywhere I mean yeah
you're supposed to smile more or like
touch their elbow I just think that this
book ain't got time for that nobody has
time for that yes I have asked a guy out
before and it's really I mean it's
feeling know I here remember asking a
guy out before your stomachs and knots
you're like holy what am i doing but at
the same time it's so empowering I love
it I'm pretty low-key about it I'm not
like will you go on a date with me I
just set up the plans I'm a planner
there was one time where I like this guy
and he was too shy to make a move I was
too shy to make a move and like nothing
happened because I know girls don't do
this naturally it just makes me feel
more special there is this stereotype
that the guy should ask the girl I think
society frowns on women asking run out
because then the woman seems desperate
or aggressive or people say oh if you
show them you're too interested he'll
lose interest I think a lot of it has to
do with like power and if a man is asked
out by a woman then it seems like this
power is being taken from him girls
playing more aggressive roles in society
can only help it like why does a guy
have to control it if you're freaking
dating this guy or girl usually like
like I just want to spend time with you
what's wrong with that we need to be
more open with our feelings we need to
be more open about like what we want if
you watch oh man go get your man okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
