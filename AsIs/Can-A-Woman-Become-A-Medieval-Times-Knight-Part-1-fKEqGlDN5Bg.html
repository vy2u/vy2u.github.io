of leelee sobieski when I came across a
photo of her and Joan of Arc the picture
excited me and it begged the question
have there been other female nights with
the internet giving me absolutely no
information I decided to go to the only
place that still has working nights
today
I looked up the nearest castle and
decided there's truly only one way to
get my questions answered so I galloped
over to the local medieval times first I
wanted to interview the male Knights to
see just what the deal was so how hard
would you say your job is depends on the
day
is very tough at times ah you have to
jump off horses full speed okay
sword fight all without hurting yourself
or others it's a physically and mentally
demanding so what types of physical
skills would you say that you'll need
I think balance is it probably is very
good one to have hand-eye coordination
mm-hmm endurance that's probably the
main one has there ever been a female
Knight not yet there has not been why do
you think that is well there weren't any
female Knights back then right
historically these properly stepped up
to the challenge but maybe one has not
risen to the challenge
snow is you know rise up to the
challenge at all do they tell you guys
because of all use the exact same
wording to this is the challenging job
do you think that a female could do it
yes I do absolutely yeah it depends on
the female just like it depends on the
male yeah I believe females and males
are equal come so he's a feminist that
makes me a feminist did you think like I
could do it the apparent coronation yeah
I am an incredible bowler okay played a
lot of basketball as a kid okay like I
was probably the best in high school I
won the PE award congratulate I was the
best at physical fitness yeah you could
do it well it's clear that they believe
no woman has risen to the challenge yet
so I decided that I must now become a
knight eager to start my training is the
first female Knight in history I first
needed to entrench myself in the
traditional and very authentic Knight
culture by drinking the finest of
domestic ales and toting proper garb
as I watched the tournament I noticed it
was a lot of riding on horses easy and
charming women easier as the show
continued I watched them do all sorts of
tricks with their swords and fighting to
hold on to their masculinity and I have
to say I got into it it got more intense
in the show went on and I wondered who
would win the prize of manliest man by
the end of the tournament I was certain
that becoming a knight would be a breeze
you
oh wait did I hurt you no okay reckon to
it
yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
