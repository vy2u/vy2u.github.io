yet there has not been why do you think
that is well there weren't any female
Knights back then all right let's start
guy he's uh properly stepped up to the
challenge
continuing on my quest I met with Jesse
the head night to see if I have what it
takes what are we going to teach me
today I'm going to teach you how to
swing the sword okay we're gonna start
up pretty simple with a wooden sword
I'll teach you the basics it's
essentially what I teach all of our
Squires you're good enough we'll promote
you to a real sword how would I be able
to show that I'm good enough maybe if
you can beat me okay done I'm gonna go
get dressed in something a little more
comfortable and then I'll come back down
here and we'll umm make me a knight all
right
okay all set alright let's get you a
sword
now this very important thing of on
guard and fighting is a battle cry so
when you're fighting someone your your
no no not cry no battle cry yeah
different completely different but no
you want to strike fear into the heart
of your opponent so when I say on guard
you're gonna get to the on guard
position and I want to hear your battle
cry sure you can do that yeah all right
hung guard our government that's scary
it's clear that Jesse wasn't here for my
jokes despite that I was determined to
do a good job after absolutely crushing
it it was time for an upgrade a little
heavier than the wooden sword is that
blood uh no scraping do you think like
being a good dancer would be house a lot
yes just a dancer team I'm the dancer
swords strike good one more I don't know
are you I did it again okay flag flag
this we're not using that part wow it's
like it's all gone oh wait did I hurt
you okay I'm directing to it Paul
ambulance
I didn't teacher the kill it's just
murdered him
there's a spark that spark you're
officially a knight you got a spark
feminism so how'd I do
you did it amazing I'm very impressed
how long would you say it would take for
me to become a light just by twice maybe
a month just polish anything yeah which
is actually really quick the hard part
is the horse riding now so you believe
that a female could be a knight oh
absolutely
hey and you did amazing today so like I
said I'm impressed really Brittany by
the power vested in me I hereby dub thee
Knight Britannia in the holy altar of
san martín now rise Knight Patania and
accepted privileges and duties that
accompany this great honor I do
what's that your tongue cool your Dyson
well there you have it I'm a knight now
just goes to show you that it doesn't
matter what gender you are female male
gender nonconforming as long as you're
willing to rise to the challenge if you
want to become a mother good night you
can become a mother
oh no sorry
Tomek that's okay that's nothing
this is right in the stomach does that
hurt No</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
