already and it's only day one and I'm
about to cry because I'm so nervous my
relationship with my body is deeply
complicated I want so deeply to love
myself the way I am but it is so hard I
do everything I can to try to hide my
cellulite you know growing up here
staying next to your friends someone
walks by and they have cellulite and
someone makes a comment about it oh it's
disgusting and you she should cover that
up and then I hear that I internalized
sex I'm like oh my god I have tons of
cellulite all over my body
I think that now that I am a part of the
media I can change the narrative finally
so this week I have three major
challenges the first one is that would
be walking around in a very public place
wearing short shorts number two is going
running in public and then the third
challenge is to go buy a bikini and then
wear the bikini in public and try to be
a boss message when I'm probably dying
inside I'm about to leave to go to work
wearing my first outfit and I am
physically shaking I'm so nervous
all right so this is what I'll be
looking at all day i cellulite thighs so
we're basically the same thing every day
we're mostly black dresses never go
above the knee always in long sleeves if
he doesn't care why should I care what
do you think about my outfit today
you look hot yeah I don't know why you
don't wear stuff like this more often
show off those legs I've never seen you
wear a dress
that before and I love it how do you
feel exposed so for the first meet event
I walked through a really public mall
I'm gonna flop these bad boys around I'm
not excited about it I'm not I'm
pretending like it's funny but it's not
a moment I stepped out of my car and
realized what I was going to do I was
like oh wait time as I was walking
through the mall it was just tons of the
worst things you could ever think about
yourself about an hour in I was in the
middle of H&amp;amp;M and I had a really insane
anxiety attack I don't feel comfortable
yet showing my silence is a public and I
felt like everybody was just staring at
me and I know it's not true man I just
didn't I didn't feel as good as I
thought I would what made it so bad was
that every time I felt good about myself
I would walk past a mirror and I would
see my reflection and I think it kept
bringing me back to reality which was
like oh yeah you have cellulite so my
parents are in town what do you guys
think about cellulite in general it's a
curse my mother had it
she was very petite even though I feel
badly about it I don't think that
anybody should be judged for having
cellulite
we just have to learn to live with it
and women should be kinder to one
another about it today I am running in
public in front of everyone it's already
hard enough to workout in gyms everyone
there is totally in shape and then here
you are in a treadmill and you feel like
everything's tickling and out there
everyone's staring at you because you
don't know what you're doing but running
in public for me is even worse when I
finished jogging I went home and I was
just so mad that I let people dictate
how I felt about my body for this long
honestly looking back on the footage of
me running I'm like more embarrassed on
my bad form that I'm a terrible athlete
more than like my cellulite I just had
this weird sense of a calm release when
I was walking in a bikini next to all
these people and fully clothed outfits
it felt weird for sure there's nothing
not weird about that but it was a weird
way of walking around being like coz it
was is almost like if anyone did stare
at me and hated me for whatever reason
it's on them nois anything mean if
anything people were totally normal and
didn't probably think twice and even if
they did fuck'em because I am so over
people body shaming and I'm so over
people telling me how to feel about
myself I'm just so over everyone telling
me how my body should be instead of me
it's so funny how your mind can trick
you into thinking things are real when
they're not and I you know I don't know
what really happened I can't read other
people's minds but the more honest we
are about who we actually are and what
we actually look like and how we
actually feel about things the more that
we can actually change things when I
started this challenge I was on the
verge of tears almost every day that I
had to show my sight you light the world
and then by the end I was so free from
from all the worry and all the thoughts
that society had on me and all the
expectations
and that felt awesome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
