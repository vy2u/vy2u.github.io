this pool safety poster in which they
have a diverse group of kids displaying
what are some good things and what are
some not-so-good things to do at the
pool this poster received a huge amount
of backlash on Twitter for being subtly
racist I will say for myself when I
first saw the poster I immediately had
an idea as to what the criticism was
going to be about with that I decided to
then play a little game with my
coworkers called can you see what I see
so here's the thing we all grew up and
came from different backgrounds and so
that means that we're all going to have
their in perspectives when it comes to
looking at the same situation so with
that in mind I gave my coworkers a copy
of the slow poster here and I told them
to tell me what they see I see a sign
that says be cool follow the rules I've
got these little arrows of kids that
seem like cool and not cool and then I
don't know what this kids doing it looks
like he's drowning which I don't know
yeah you're right that's not cool huh
that's just people having fun in the
pool trying to decipher the deeper
meaning of this I went around and not
cool kids black I don't even know what
they're doing that isn't cool literally
the only cool ones are this white female
about to go on the diving board and
another like white dad okay so there is
one not cool white dude who's drinking a
beer I think I need better directions of
like what is not cool like this drawing
is garbage period and I went to go look
in the comment section of the article
there were a lot of people who not only
couldn't see what I saw
but we're refusing to see what I saw I
think people that don't see it as a
problem are the people that are pouring
it as cool you know they're like oh what
ku cares about skin color I don't deal
with it if you see this and you're like
ah racism doesn't happen this is just a
cartoon like you're not seeing what's
out there and what's out there is it's
really scary especially right now what's
going on our
you were allowing these small little
things like this to become normal being
a white guy I look to the white faces in
the photo and go oh they're having fun
of the pool I'll have fun at the pool I
can only imagine being in someone else's
shoes and looking at this and going oh
well the people I identify with in this
photo are not cool they're troublemakers
if you're the ones who are constantly
being pointed you're the bad people like
you do bad things like yeah it'll piss
you off
racism starts small you having good
people that don't mean to be racist but
like this is either neglect or we're
purposely and intentionally choosing to
depict minorities in a certain way but
were a person of color looking at this I
just wouldn't feel welcome at the pool
so this picture got a lot of backlash
why do you think people might have been
upset about it I feel like I should be
able to see it
Oh like you look at it and you're like
great diversity they show all different
kinds of people I mean it's got white
black all different races plus a whale
but also we still have our associations
of what has been embedded and our
consciousness for like decades also ties
in how Asian people aren't really seen
in media like you can literally have a
whale floating blowing a whistle and not
have an Asian person it's disappointing
that something that's portrayed as
taking a couple steps forward when
really it isn't showing much progress at
all I don't think that the red cross is
a racist organization nor do I think
that they have graceless intentions when
making this poster but I do think that
it's important for us as a society to
acknowledge the fact that we've all been
socialized to believe certain things
about different groups of people and
that if we don't take the time to
acknowledge them then that can affect
our perspective when doing our jobs like
making this poster or when it comes to
policing a neighborhood but that being
said if we can take the time to
challenge those biases we can be better
than our socializations</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
