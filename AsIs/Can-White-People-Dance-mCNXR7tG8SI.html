stereotype that white people can't dance
okay have you guys ever heard that
stereotype before I've heard that white
people can't jump and it's true okay oh
yeah they can dance have you ever heard
this stereotype before a lot of times
yeah do you think it's true um in some
cases in some cases yes no I say it's
90% true no not really after you got
served I think they squash that do you
know how to do it very much so very much
so
I found out that I'm white and I can
dance so I don't know if I can pinpoint
one collective group of people that
dance better than the other so I decided
to ask someone legit I know you've
probably heard stereotypes about how
different races are born with like
innate rhythm and in other races aren't
how true is that if we go back in time
to literally about 10,000 BC was the
first cave paintings that we see people
dancing when you went out and did work
the kind of tools you use affected how
you danced if we think about European
culture cold climates you're most likely
to get your food would have hunted this
is the movement they do when they hunt
when they dance guess how they dance
their torso state is one piece we call
that single unit torso right so they
have rhythm but it's just done a certain
way now if you look at a warm climate
say climate from in Africa
most people they might hunt but they
also gather they're an agriculture
society right they plant so you're
reaching way high and then you have to
put the fruit in the back or you're
reaching what way low and you have to
put fruit wherever you're putting the
fruit right so there's all this movement
we see that people from warmer climates
tend to when they dance have an
undulating torso right we call it
multi-unit torso have you ever seen a
black person that has a different kind
of rhythms ever come I'm glad you said
it
yeah I've seen people every creating
color that have really we could consider
maybe more simple kind of rhythm the big
questions can white people did mmm yes
yes all people can dance all people can
bit okay
so mark definitely took me to school
mind blown but I decided to throw myself
in the mix can I even dance if you're
comfortable with yourself and like you
just trust yourself like feel the music
and dance and do whatever you want then
it's going to be
good cool all right well today you're
going to teach me a little
something-something okay I'm going to
see if I can keep up all right guys you
got it all right let's go okay
so that was actually way harder than
expected and yes guys Chris is a
phenomenal dancer everyone can dance
it's just that different cultural groups
have different rhythms plus how your
raise has a lot to do with how you
boogie too but in the end what does it
matter anyway just do the thing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
