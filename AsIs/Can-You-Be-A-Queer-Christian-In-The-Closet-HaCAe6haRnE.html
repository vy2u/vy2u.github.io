special episode of in the closet
nikki is dead that's drawing hi just
kidding Nikki's not that she's not dead
hi I'm Jen that's Jordan you today's
topic Christianity and how it intersects
with a queer identity just so you know
we're speaking from personal experiences
here I'm here to learn guess who's
coming to hang out Nicki come into the
side door of the closet I'll get in here
you beautiful oh some Wonder Woman
buxom I don't know I'm Nicki cool what
are your pronouns I use she/her pronouns
cool no are this okay so we're talking
about something that I really want about
which is can you be a queer Christian
can you can you I think so because I am
and I think you are too yes we do so
they exist so they're real I'm gonna
take this off now well okay I think it's
important to say Christianity
encompasses a lot of people sure so many
all over the world for like a very long
time in history these are just like
things that we've been through but I
thought it would be important to talk
about this today because I think there
are a lot of people who are like me who
were queer and in Christian homes and
had no idea how to reconcile two sides
of themself for me at least I grew up in
a space where it was like queerness is
this thing that you deal with it's not
like a life that you it's like a life of
queerness is just something that you try
and perhaps work around yeah can you
hear that phone ring oh Jesus
you know I grew up in a church but when
I was 16 like I chose for myself that I
was gonna be a Christian based off of my
own personal experiences then I fell in
love with a woman whoops who was also a
Christian so made that very complex you
grew up Catholic I did I was raised
Catholic yeah my I think a lot of my
identity wasn't necessarily tied to
religion so I think realizing I was gay
wasn't I'm he was difficult but for
other reasons so how did you reconcile
being gay being Christian
then like being happy did you do that it
was tough because I had a very like
confronting experience with other
Christians I was outed to some pastors I
know I had very real feelings for
somebody who also had very real feelings
for me
yeah but then at the same time I had
these people that I looked up to and
respected a spiritual leader is telling
you what I was doing was very very very
wrong so was very confusing and after a
while I realized that every day that I
was trying to figure it out was every
day I was just living as a queer
Christian already and so there were
things that I could torture myself over
or I could not and it took time it took
I'd say like a good year is it ironic
that I'm wearing a Santa hat yeah an
ironic kind of for these yeah that's not
what irony means thinking okay Jordan
what does it mean to sort of know that
you're living as a queer Christian when
you've been taught other things I can't
say if anybody's wrong or right but I
think what really helped for me was
thinking about how small I am in
comparison to if you're a Christian this
understanding of an omnipotent God sure
who knows the universe in great detail
like I didn't surprise God and so I
wasn't like surprised and he was like oh
no I have to redo that never happened
okay I'm not a part of a church right
now cuz I haven't found a community that
well I want to be a part of but what I
have done is actually found a lot of
other queer Christians Jordan being one
Lissa yeah I am like I've met a good
handful of us who have similar
experiences shared experiences than all
of us are okay are you okay Jordan how
cool I feel it or it is great what what
do you think like is something that
might have been comforting when you were
struggling um God's not mad at you
there's nothing from my study of the
Bible be it what it may got something
out of you there is no person or rule I
believe that can dictate your
relationship with them yeah anyway so my
girlfriend and I are still together
we've been together for four years we're
both Christians we met in the church and
we love
yeah you've met her she's great she's
awesome she's like cool ladies cooler
than I am that was true okay yeah Oh
what is next
guess what Nikki turn around show
everybody that back here head as you can
examine this is the part of Nikki's head
that is exceptionally gay and guess
who's gonna shave this thing oh
my gosh Harlan it's gonna go great
you've never used a pair of clippers I
have never used possibly power oh oh
 yeah it's fine
no I should stop I don't know what wait
just look Jordan come look at this does
this look normal
okay so what what happened Jordan why am
i now behind camera Jen was too much
under pressure she had an anxiety attack
I'm taking over you want to look at it I
think we can be done now everywhere yeah
it's like down your shirt yeah
the trash bag didn't work that well
should we leave a closet now yeah I
really know five bye everybody
get out of there tackle Oh No nice to
have a close shave welcomed in the
