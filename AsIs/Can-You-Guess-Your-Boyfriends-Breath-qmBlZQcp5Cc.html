(epic orchestral music)
(record scratching)
- Who's here?
One more.
(breathes out)
Okay, noted.
(slow motion blowing out)
- We've been together for three years.
- You're such a weirdo.
We've been dating a year and a half now?
- Yeah.
- Maybe a little bit more.
- I think I know 95 percent about Caitlin.
There's a 5 percent I don't know,
which is probably like
she's murdered a person.
- I gotta wait on the statute
of limitations on that for sure.
- We're really bad at
competitions like this one.
- If we were smelling retainers,
I think I could get it though.
(dissonant electronic music)
- Caitlin, can you hear?
Caitlin.

- I know he's a really good flosser.
- Um.
- B.
- I think he was A.
- I'm gonna go with B.
- Hi.
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
- [Safiya] Was I right?
- [Tyler] Yeah.
(laughs)
(laughs)
- You were B?
That was my second choice.
- What did my breath smell like?
- Like flesh.
Is that gross?
- Was it the braces?
- I've never known you without
braces, so that could very well be.
- And you were shy about
it, you were like...
- I knew--
- Breathe in my face, I wanna see.
- No, my breath's bad right now.
- If I was ever in a situation
where Caitlin had to save my life
based off of my breath
then I'd feel very secure.
- B was a good second choice.
- I'm always a good choice.
(breathes out)
- Oh yeah, I can guess that.
That is standard bad breath Safiya.
(breathes out)
- [Safiya] Yeah.
- [Tyler] Is that bad breath Tyler?
- It's medium breath Tyler.
- Medium breath, all right, there we go.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
