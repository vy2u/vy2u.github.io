for the pop quiz I don't know much about
makeup in general but do you know what
these things are on my face I for sure
know that there's some lipstick going on
I have taken Steve to Sephora and I love
it and I could say we do go to support
another sometimes yeah now I am at
blackout my makeup sits next to the sink
where he washes his face every morning
every morning your actual makeup I see
it on your face I've never seen it in a
heap I know the end result looks like I
do have some very clear objects in the
makeup bag that should be a giveaway if
you don't get it it's okay you know I
don't mind well I know that because I've
failed every single BuzzFeed competition
ever
I was going to rely pretty heavily on
the bag itself cuz I definitely know
Sofia has a pink bag that she puts her
makeup in there's so many different
things and each of these bags you guys
really stuffed it in there I'm hoping
for like the silver lining to be there's
just one piece of makeup that isn't in
any of the other bags that I've seen
before this is a tattoo liner liquid
eyeliner okay
so soft uses eyeliner maybe that's a
possibility we got some Sephora oh oh
Sephora uh-uh it all smells like sharpie
definitely seen softer doing the dab
thing on her face before with this guy
now I know Freddy likes color but she's
very specific with her colors yeah no I
don't think self aware that like this
looks more like nail polish I don't know
it all looks familiar all right maybe
I'll get some more luck with this
there's a lot of a skinnier items in
here Jen doesn't strike me as someone
who would take the time to use primer
water it's got a little mirror in here
how's it going no this is this is not
Jen perfect brow pencils for the brows
she likes her brows I know she wants to
cut my brows y'all over to the smoking
gun right here she's talked really
highly this metal matte lipstick from
Kylie this is a number one contender
right now okay this one currently is my
frontrunner it's instinctual I don't
know I I'm repelled by this one see like
all of this oh this stuff like may as
well just all be the same to me oh hello
I don't know what this is urban decay
heavy metal I'm gonna say this might be
Freddy's let me go throw that out there
all right
oh there's hair sticking out of it which
I deduce that based on the fact that
your hair is all over the place this
could be a clear indicator this is for
sure her brand I don't know if this is
her specifically oh I haven't seen a
photo finish
Amanda did point in our bathroom maybe
this is not the one you know what
there's no Kylie Jenner in this one now
that there's a Kylie Jenner played I
don't know if I really can want to be
wasting anyone's time here I think I
would've seen this guy to be honest a
little bit of a brighter color looks
like a clown nose we got this bad boy I
touched it oh no
oh I'm sorry to who's ever bag this is
so this is a little bit worrisome this
is a color pop again i I've just heard
the word color pop whoa this is called
better than sex mascara oh
so I thought this games being played
right now this is a Kylie Jenner lip kit
and this is a metallic one just Kylie
like Kylie Jenner
I feel like Jen doesn't have this like
bronzy poppin lipstick okay
that was the same as the bag that was a
heavy number one contender so this is
going me off a little bit now this is
not this is not Jones
the color scheme across the board I feel
like this is a lot of tans I think I'm
ready to make my decision
alright between these two that comes
down to these two Kylie Jenner in both
color popping both the eye things are
kind of throwing me for a loop
my gut says this one bores my heart say
I just go ahead and pick one that's my
opinion is that this is your vibe
are you thinking how confident are you
um 100% you're ready yeah yeah whoo you
got it right
hahahaha that's hey he nailed it this is
my bag but what I thought
Steve would get is that he bought me
this letter eyeliner won my body in
Vegas when he was drunk so it's these
things that that gave it away the funny
thing is I just got these two and I have
not worn these around you ever before
that's great I was so impressed by how
much attention you pay to the stuff that
I like well you like this stuff it's
meaningful to you I'm proud of you Steve
I'm so proud of you because honestly
that was really hard
well but you get my plane right now
you're feeling that Batman one there you
go see you lucky you pay attention to
something I'm doing to write few search
Arkham City are you saying sighs one
plane this will be game</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
