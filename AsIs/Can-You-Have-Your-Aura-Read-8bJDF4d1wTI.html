around you and it can go 9 feet in any
direction hi I'm dr. Lana Betancourt and
I'm here today using my or equipment
allows you to get you know 20-plus page
report in detail in regards to your
auras your chakras and just tell you a
little bit about what's going on within
your life we're good I'm getting my aura
red which is a thing about energy I'm
definitely more like Christian spiritual
rather than a more secular form of it
I'm not particularly religious but I am
a spiritual person usually I'm I am kind
of a skeptic I want you to look at this
camera in which you place your hand on
that handle plate take a deep breath you
never can smile hold it cleansing breath
and release it through you know just
would you think about what makes you
happy what brings you joy what's the
what's the good things in your life so
we're going to take this and we're going
to print this now because we found the
center of who you really are from a
religious perspective you've got a lot
of angels around you there's one that's
right right over here on your left side
and it's almost like a maternal one
you've got a lot of creativity coming
into you right now no I notice I only
have like to color just reds and yellows
like you got a little I I just see a
little purple see right there we're
gonna see a little bit of purple that's
mysticism and magical stuff for you yeah
definition next level take it it does it
makes loud quince you can do one of the
ones that speak a lot of creativity out
into the universe your future is bound
to be thought-provoking as well as
highly creative what a wonderful thing
to hear seen a little bit of a white
light in there so when you feel like
some like you're getting a message or
feels like a deja vu to you you feel
like you're getting a message
truly a message coming to you so
listening to what that is so I wanted to
talk to you a little bit about your
chakras their chakras yeah so we look at
this chakra your life where chakra you
love life you love it to pieces and oh
shucks now you possibly will begin to
have opportunities to enjoy there's two
chakras that I would like to sort of
address for you and that's your heart
chakra and your sacral chakra there
they're the lowest ones frequency wise
for you start appreciating you as much
as the world and in spirit appreciates
you because you're very very very
appreciated and then you come up to your
um to your solar plex on which is act 19
I present but I understand also when
you're at a place like that where your
solar plexus chakra is so huge you don't
want to squeeze off the energy from the
other ones because you've got so much of
that so you want to try to make sure
that you stay in balance from the peace
of it here's here's that throat chakra
your your a very quiet person and you
don't necessarily speak about things
that's going even though you're
empowered about your life so you just
want to take the time sometimes and just
speak out you have no problems talking
about things and doing things saying
things suddenly just calling me like a
loudmouth and then the last one it's
your crown chakra and you're a hundred
percent there yes
so does that resonate to you from that
perspective totally loving yourself will
allow to also to start enjoying that
life that you have you work so much I
should forget to take care of you
yeah she did you're very welcome
so I do like it that's the last page of
your report when you did the angel part
like I almost subscribe this was more
delightful than I anticipated it being
the part about me needing to kind of
love myself a little more and give
myself a little more credit that was
like right on the God as Christians we
believed our spirits come on Brett down
in here that's where you get your
conscience from and the fact that that
in this and my two strongest points that
made a lot of sense and that part
definitely home the most I don't know
exactly what the science is behind this
but it's just so nice to hear kind words
like that and apparently I'm gonna get
super laid soon so auras are awesome
more fun than a regular doctor I you're
gonna get laid in the next three months
I'm telling you you will be a lots of it
