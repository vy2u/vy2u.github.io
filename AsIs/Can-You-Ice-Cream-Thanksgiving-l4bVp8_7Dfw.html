of salt &amp;amp; straw ice cream and we're at
their kitchens to find out if we can
combine Thanksgiving dinner and dessert
into one what's happening where we of
course we want to make corn in the ice
cream we're going to take this corn
we're going to juice it and make that
corn juice into a pudding and then put
that back in that I school
okay what do we got cherry maybe there's
some sort of liqueur in there maybe kind
of sting II pumpkin oh my god so good
hey slightly alcoholic is that a thing
was it honey bourbon corn pudding I
didn't taste the corn corn or pudding I
think there no real dish is it corn
pudding
I had the Bourbon at the beginning yeah
verdict is delicious yes you can ice
cream it that was good mmm that's got
like a pie it's definitely pumpkin
something pumpkin but like real pumpkin
math pumpkin spice this tastes like
 pumpkin
I taste pumpkin I taste cinnamon that is
a complete pumpkin pie crust pie filling
whipped cream all in one button I don't
like what's in my mouth I don't like
that contraire oh I'm Kim what's that
word spicy Trevor oh I always forget
jabbering well we know that stuffing so
we imported some brown bread from New
Jersey
yeah and we're going to candy it and mix
it realize okay this is the stuff in
candy so we're getting everything
together these are the walnuts the
cranberries we imagine in the perfect
stuff we've got all the ingredients
let's go spin it in ice cream
I like ice cream stop me oh there's like
walnuts in there there's not that much
Thanksgiving flavor coming through but
there's just like kind of gross mush in
the middle whatever this is yes you can
ice cream it hey I think you just want
to give me cranberry walnut man yeah
okay so we have pecan or pecan
we're going to Pauline these separately
becomes for a sweet potato casserole
I feel like I'm inside like a
gingerbread house
so I know there's some storage in your
bread in there right definitely tastes
like pumpkin pie cranberries
maybe sweet potatoes I'm good wash I
mean it's really good though
sweet potato casserole with maple pecan
that's incredible the casserole I don't
know what that's all about but yeah
sweet potato casserole definitely can I
scream it alright there's nothing
Thanksgiving about this by way I don't
give a it's delicious
this one is not my favorite for he's a
golf world this is delicious what am i
eating right now it's got chunking it
what is it some sort of toffee in there
puffy salted caramel Oh her tea that was
delicious that means it was the best one
I'm not gonna lie they keep they kept
getting better I didn't taste Turkey but
it was still delicious so yes you can
ask me that just because you can put an
entire Thanksgiving meal together in an
ice-cream form doesn't necessarily mean
that you should however in this case yes
you should
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
