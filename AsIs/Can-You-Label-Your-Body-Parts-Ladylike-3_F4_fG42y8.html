fallopian tube is yeah just random it's
apparently as thin as a strand of hair
or maybe it's a strand of spaghetti Oh
today we're labeling our bodies and the
things that are inside of them I feel
like I know a decent amount about my
organs just because I'm a frequent or of
WebMD so I did take this one BuzzFeed
quiz that was like the hardest quiz
you'll ever take on the vagina at the
end of it it said that I was on my way
to becoming a Virginia's I mean that's a
medical degree basically I also grew up
in a house a lot of mirrors so I'm
familiar with like the way it looks so
you hand mirror yeah this is both of the
intestines yeah I think it's both yeah
this is the large intestine oh you're
the miniature intestine your stomach is
like they're kids oh yeah the old hot
dog maze
this guy goes like a little bit higher
right it's more like there I don't even
know which way is up you know we're
gonna put it here just as like an
approximate because I think this is too
big above your intestine the bladder is
probably kind of easy right the reason
we put the kidneys back here is because
a there wasn't really enough space in
the front but be also I'm pretty sure
your kidneys are back here right yeah
they're on like the sides with you a
bladder probably should end up right
here liver isn't the liver oh no your
kidneys are in the back your liver is on
the sides right yeah all I know is
Grey's Anatomy okay it's weird how many
body parts look like an elephant the fun
part like here's I think it's a little a
little higher yeah perfect
yep Keon tube okay Scott yeah is the
plural of uterus you try this well it's
uterus
yeah um ovary yeah cervix is uh the
entrance of the uterus so it will be
like right yeah the vagine is gonna be
lower right yep
vulva is outside yeah oh no sorry the
genes gonna be higher because they
elbows the fleshy part we did it yes I
think it's just misleading to have the
bladder which is this little weird guy
and the kidneys on the same thing
because in reality it's kind of like
kidneys are in the back and this does
splatters in the front I don't I don't
even know where like the stomach is
that's whatever it's approximately here
yeah all the stuff that I deal with
every day we knew about I feel like we
did a pretty good job me too you don't
need any of this stuff to be a lady but
this lady just has its own answers lies
behind a food baby can you get a food
baby from a hot tub can you get a food
baby for making out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
