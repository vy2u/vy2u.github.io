to match couples with each other things
would be very difficult yes no I think
there's a whole group dynamic thing
going on with the psychology of walking
there's no context whatsoever and I mean
I've seen a lot of couples that I would
never put together that are together I'm
gonna look at iContact body language
what you're gonna do is you're gonna
grab couples one by one and put them in
a prom pose along this line you can't
ask them questions right okay I feel
like there was some chemistry between
these guys right here how do i how do I
make them stand a little more this bags
hands on the waist
there we go I feel like I'm feeling it a
little bit more now I'm like more in
tune with the energy you and you your
pair go ten
okay all right cool got it you and you
and then that leaves you guys and then
the last two how did I do okay y'all are
all laughing at me so I must be wrong
so Nick you've matched all the couples
how do you think you did I think I got
100% right to be honest I'm pretty
confident very confident yeah okay uh
let's go through and see how well you
did all right are you guys a couple no
are you sure no whoo 0 for 3 which means
are you guys a couple and are you
surprised yeah I want to know I want to
know who's with who now I didn't know
they were laughing at me while I did it
so I think maybe like zero are you two a
couple no no sorry guys okay you look
cute together though thank you
No all right guys I think you might want
to consider switching it up because I'm
a pretty good matchmaker just saying how
do you feel about your selections I'm a
little iffy are you two dating gosh I
got one it was harder than that than I
thought actually I guess you can't
really tell who's going out with who or
what kind of sexual orientation people
have all right guys are you ready to see
who's really dating whoo yeah yeah all
right reveal it to them know it no oh
sorry I was all wrong I got one great
you got one oh wow that one that's one
right here I was gonna take that one but
then I don't know why changing like
Bonita is the champion yes just going
off of looks I don't think it's enough I
was able to interview each person I feel
like I could probably put it together I
think it's really hard to judge people
on what they look like and the race or
what they're wearing you can't tell
everyone's a human there you have it
folks it's really hard to match couple
and Bonita got one and she's the
champion so she's sort of one with a low
score ha ha there's no prizes for
getting one right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
