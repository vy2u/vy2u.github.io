and someone else's love like I have done
a lot of online dating and I
hate it I have no experience online
dating but my mom has shown my headshot
to a lot of guys at Best Buy I've used
tinder and that's it I've never used
OkCupid but I know Chris well enough to
make an honest profile you don't have
any experience then should you be making
money I think so I think you know a
blind leading the blind is the best I've
read a lot of profiles and know when I
see a good one use your name oh my god
so it's like Instagram what will drive
the most traffic oh we're making
username Ben thew Zee azzam the one
you've been waiting for
I barely understand what you guys wrote
up for nothing oh that's already big
available yup I'm trapping Tron we'll
take that we're gonna take Ben's photo
I'm not gonna be in it cuz that's weird
his laugh I don't I don't like laughing
out of you I think my arm should be in
it so with your arm yet but your arm
people know I have a friend I don't look
like a creep there I feel like a little
little creepy I've totally liked photos
like this about me
how would your best friend describe you
up for anything dollar sign dollar sign
exclamation point
yes I'm gonna use only one we came up
for your gender you're certain to have a
fun night with me
fun date not night hey girl is that what
Ryan Gosling says bump everything up
don't put top but like supermodel
Oh supermodel tall okay supermodel tall
supermodel funny
thank you what I'm doing with my life
what do you do day-to-day like maybe
just you know wake up living my best
life you should have like a little gunk
in the corners okay cook in the corners
I enjoy a lifestyle that requires little
but fun and adventure even from the
simple vantage point of my home huh zit
squatting yeah I'm really good at oh I'm
really good at gaming not making people
angry I feel like you're probably good
cook I mean I don't really know cuz you
never cooked for me but we'll find out
alright thousands Pepsi dresses but it's
kind of like copywriting you can't be
too too details you're putting so much
more fun to this than I do my regular
profile because I'm oh no no I
appreciate maybe part the reason you're
having all these issues of love I hate
it I spend a lot of time thinking about
ooh
Oh global warming is an option followed
by lunch lunch equal importance a future
of diverse representation and
entertainment I would never would have
thought about saying bad lunch I'm
feeling good I'm feeling like I'm the
perfect candidate for a free dating web
site I think you put together so many
way better than I could have done for my
profile I try so hard to make myself
look like like what I want to be I think
I'll get better matches because she was
more honest about Who I am than I am
thank you happy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
