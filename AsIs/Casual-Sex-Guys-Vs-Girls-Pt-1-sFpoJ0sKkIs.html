weak everything I think she just stood
there while I said goodbye to my son
he'll always be my beautiful boy that's
probably the worst part the worst part
of an eleventh month break of a saying
goodbye to the dog the talk had
character it'll be good to leave town
yeah see where little Chrissy's from the
origin story gets some small-town life
in the city girl's dream my better
weekend you're single in 2015
welcome there's apps profiles casual sex
I can't have casual sex erectile
dysfunction
what no oh you were like emotionally
goggles excellent really made me sense
to me meeting somebody at a par having
empty sex and lingering text messages
just sounds stressful bacon I don't know
how you do it
cz we just have it then you've had it
and then you get McDonald's practicin
right back
you don't worry about getting
emotionally attached I don't understand
groans butt nowhere I've had a
one-night stand before but afterwards
you just feel kind of dirty like I'm
using them casual sex is different than
a one-night stands just cuz you don't
wanna be in a relationship with someone
like a friend or they need to have sex
with them so you'd have sex with a
friend
sure then what's the point what do you
mean I mean where is it you know what
sex generally with someone that you care
about yeah but it's not building up to
anything and you're just pretending like
it doesn't mean anything
sure you share intimate moments but i
compartmentalize it's fun you should try
it you get a lot less disappoint a bit
like you're just afraid of getting hurt
a lot I said Ricki Lake I don't look
like we're you a scary thing to say okay
so when someone you're upset or when you
sick you don't want the person close to
you to care for you my friends for that
I don't need the person who's Eating me
out to also be my therapist you have
never gotten emotionally attached to
someone you haven't really thought about
it I don't think that love and sex seem
to be mutually exclusive well I just
think it
I mean casual sex situations someone's
gonna wind up like any other person more
well we're here what we have five more
hours to drive this is just a McDonald's
parking lot you know all that talk about
sex I'm really hungry
coming nice pond thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
