dissatisfied with their bodies we listen
to the debilitating voices in our heads
that say we're not good enough or thin
enough or beautiful enough we compare
ourselves to photoshopped models and we
feel guilty that we don't live up to an
unattainable standard of beauty
last year roughly 132 million babies
were born worldwide as it entered the
world their mothers belly stretched
their hips widened and their breasts
inflated with milk their bodies changed
in drastic miraculous ways and yet with
children often come unwelcomed stretch
marks and permanent scars leaving women
feeling guilty unattractive and ruined
is this how we want women to look at
their bodies after giving birth what if
we shared the common experience of
physical change instead of dealing with
it in embarrassed isolation what if we
gratefully reclaimed our bodies not in
spite of their imperfections but because
of them what if we celebrated post
pregnancy bellies as powerful vessels of
life what if we empowered each other
starting today</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
