before I can remember this is really
gross looking this is what I call mom
and dad have no time to make food food
hmm
and the texture is not like a good
noodle I actually like the consistent
like the noodles or like really thick
just tastes like runny tomato juice
bathing in dog food push pops yeah
they're just they're hard to eat once
because they never fully stayed up
because they mean we would do this and
this would be like enough to entertain
us for a nap for like hours it's like
kind of a little phallic II to eat and I
don't know what this is supposed to
taste like I want to say it tastes like
melted otter pop oh my god but it looks
so good it's actually really good vegan
chicken tastes better than this that's
good and I can juice one more bite cuz
the mac and cheese is the best this is
life
cafeteria grade corn telleth the desert
is a weird pudding or a failed brownie I
don't know your kids actually eat this I
would make these for myself now Andi
snacks yeah I remember this cheese been
discussing even as a kid I had higher
standards in this no this is making me
nervous
hey it's cheese something you know what
that's pretty good tastes kind of fun I
wouldn't be opposed to double dipping
actually amazing this is not Flintstones
themed which is really disappointing it
makes me really nervous that it's not
gonna taste the same no Flintstones
it's better when served slightly thought
out this is literally the best thing
I've ever eaten like when you have to
like force it up you're just like ah but
it like doesn't it's pretty good
just like almost could use boobs or
something I mean this is essentially a
toilet paper roll and it's still really
satisfying to stuck on okay
well what do I do now I guess oh just a
little look really good though</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
