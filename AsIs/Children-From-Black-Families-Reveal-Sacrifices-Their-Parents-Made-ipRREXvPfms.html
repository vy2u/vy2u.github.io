and I haven't seen my parents since so
it's a little much my mother used to be
a dancer and when she had her first
child she was twenty-one years old she
was the right size to be a dancer just
like perfect had a lot of good things
going for her she decided to leave
behind her life of dancing to be able to
take care of my oldest brother when I
was like around elementary school I
remember for two months we didn't have
electricity
she bought a cooler and she would like
take sandwiches from work for me and my
brother Dee I remember me coming home
early and seeing her eating ice and with
like me and my brother sandwiches in
there I wish like I offered her my
sandwich I don't know what I was
thinking my dad he didn't live with us
but he always made sure to be there
always by the baseball game by the
basketball game if I had to play if I
was at church doing something he was
there he made sure to be there if I ever
needed him for anything he'll be at my
house in a half hour my mom sacrificed a
healthy work life so that I could get a
better education at a school that she
wouldn't have otherwise been able to
afford little did I know she was working
with a bunch of women who were very
catty and totally just disregarded her
and her feelings they were very
disrespectful to her and she was the
only black woman in her office she
recently told me that she would throw up
throughout the day she had so much
anxiety and she just didn't want to be
there but she's still soldiered through
and you know I would go visit her at the
end of the school day and she would have
a smile on her face and little did I
know she felt like she was trapped so my
mom sacrificed finding love and being
with someone to make sure that me and my
siblings had everything my brother who's
the last one just turned 18
and she was saying that like she's like
I didn't date all these years after my
parents got divorced because she was
like I want to make sure that I'm there
for you all and I didn't want to seem
like a distant parent I wanted my
attention to be a hundred and ten
percent she worked this one job but she
had to work it like all the time I never
got to see her she used to build the the
nose on the airplane for Boeing she
couldn't make it to the sports games and
stuff like that she kind of make it to
the open house when you know the teacher
wanted to talk when it was time for me
and when my sister is to go to college
in coming out of retirement in order for
him to take a job at Howard University
for us to be able to go to school and
have our tuition covered I'm sorry I
could admit um mom dead mom pops sweetie
that's what I call y'all my mama never
heard me say this songs just saying look
I just want to say thank you giving up
sleep for me thank you for giving up
finding love for me I remember you going
sleeping you asked us not to bother you
and I didn't understand why you didn't
want any of my attention and everything
that stuff but I'm 30 years old now I
understand I realize now that your
sacrifices were decisions that once he
made them there was no turning back
there were decisions that once he made
them it was truly a commitment to choose
us over yourself thank you for staying
together thank you for giving up your
skating and dancing dreams without your
guidance without your discipline I would
have ended up on so many roads and paths
and who knows where I would have been
you are literally my lifeline if you're
napping you answer the phone and you
just want to make sure that I'm okay I'm
grown I'm not a child and you don't have
to do that but it's still in your heart
to want to make sure that your only
daughter is in one piece it's kind of
taught me to be a lot more selfless and
I hope to be just as selfless as you are
when the time comes I'll have to hold
that torch
you proud because I have an example of
what to do I love you so much and I
don't say it enough to you but I love
you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
