the both of them left their families and
knew no one and came to this foreign
country my mom moved to America and did
he get to see her family or her siblings
for almost twenty thirty years didn't
get to see her mom's funeral didn't get
to see her siblings grow up with their
families because she was living in
America my mom used to come to my
elementary school every year with
traditional dress and a Quran and a
prayer rug to like teach the kids about
Eid one year after she came a lot of
kids made fun of sort of the way she
dressed and what she was doing and what
she was talking about and I was really
angry at her and I told her like never
to come back again because I was really
really embarrassed and she listened but
I think she was really hurt I remember
when I went to India in 2008 with my mom
for a wedding she said that was the
first time she had ever visited the
Dodge Mahal even though she grew up in
India and the reason was that she'd just
spent her life working for us my dad
before he died
he was looking for all these jobs of
things that he didn't love to do and he
loved playing music but he knew that he
had to make a little more money they
took odd jobs my dad worked at a
restaurant he cut grass I remember
stories that they used to look for
aluminum cans to recycle from the
neighborhood when I was in kindergarten
I remember that my mom she sat me down
and asked me would you like it if I
stayed home more so I could hang out
with you and I said yes and so she gave
up her career as a computer engineer
to become a full-time mom my mom was
encouraged to be a stay-at-home mom in
her older years she felt really isolated
because it contributed to her not being
able to learn English and make friends
outside of the Family Circle you know I
used to cry every time that my mom would
drop me off there's like a video of me
at daycare and I was like three years
old and I ran after her and they had to
go get me and my mom would cry too cuz
she didn't want to leave me but she had
to work even to this day my parents are
still struggling like financially when I
got into college I got into UCLA and USC
UCLA being a public school which was a
lot cheaper than USC a private school
and my dad just said go wherever you
want and we'll figure it out
my parents had to take out a lot of
loans and stuff I didn't get any
scholarships or anything we're still
paying those off right now oh man okay
oh hi mom and dad
mom dad mom thank you for all the little
things that you did that I didn't know
about especially as a single mom raising
us all by herself and even to this day
working six days a week still and now I
don't always say it but I really
appreciate everything you've done for me
I'm sorry for the way I acted as a kid
because I'm not ashamed of you I'm
really proud of you and I'm really
proud of who you are and I'm really
sorry that I used to pretend that I was
white I'm really sorry that I used to
pretend that I wasn't Muslim in there
thank you for everything you did more
than I ever deserved
sorry I love you thanks mom thank you
all of the sacrifices they made by the
time I came along and like was aware of
it it's almost like they had already
done all the groundwork so that I
thought my life was easy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
