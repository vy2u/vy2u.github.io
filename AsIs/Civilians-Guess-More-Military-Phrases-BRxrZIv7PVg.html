good great kind of compliment
maybe it's like the overzealous guy who
like always slaps people on the ass like
when they've done a good job why you got
to give the gay man the buttshark
sign so instead of saying
they say that's blood shark but shark
sounds like something my ex-boyfriend
used to try sometimes but shark is the
Dudley do-right sailor brown-noser who
makes everyone else look bad also don't
provoke Lobster
okay hey grab a box out it's a classic
treat on bass a chili dog with shredded
mozzarella on top I think a devil dog is
when a random street dog in a foreign
country approaches you and attaches to
you and you fall in love with that dog
last time I checked a duffel dog looks
like one of those like little hostess
snacks this sexy marine right here in
devil dog hoorah this mod lis attractive
Marine over here is a devil dog aka to
400 the Battle of belleau wood the
Germans describe Marines in the fight as
toughened hundun which stands for
hellhounds that's where they got the
name double-dog like oh I need someone
to snipe that person oh don't worry the
silver bullets got it is our military
fighting werewolves a sliver bullet is
like a bullet but it's a smaller one a
bullet made of silver or a sex toy
Silver Bullet is if you're in combat
fighting werewolves Yugi already made
that joke yeah there you go that's what
doc right there we all had one of those
at least once hell no wait talking about
exhaustion stroke dehydration we have to
go get the temperature to make sure it
wasn't heatstroke through the rectal you
don't want to be a heat casualty could
you get the silver bullet that's the
prison that people go to if they've been
bad in the military the void where all
the mail goes to from your loved ones
that you don't find for like six fun
I think the sect is cleaning toilets
this is just being in the military like
oh yeah which suck were you in I was in
the first Iraq suck
because I wore socks right we're all
more than that
I enlisted in the suck as a 17 year old
it has up and downs couldn't wait to get
the out of there
a loop to the Korean Marines serving at
home and abroad
I saw the sub from a distance I was
there for so I don't have to deal with
the suck very much if you didn't know
the suck is your enlistment but more
commonly known as in Iraq and
Afghanistan
there's bunk beds and they're the ones
that have to sleep on the middle bunk is
it like a midwife for rats mid rats are
the people who are like in the middle of
the ship and they don't get to see the
sunlight he's in the middle rank he
shouldn't be in that rank so he's a mid
rat military's 24/7 so you got feed the
guys that are up at night min died
rations thank you we're Midrats Midrats
we get it military you have a bunch of
cool words that we don't get to say with
sharks and bullets and tough people's
stuff okay what did you on ice me hit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
