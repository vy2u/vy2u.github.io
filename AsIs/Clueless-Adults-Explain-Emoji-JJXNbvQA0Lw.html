like pictures to say what you don't want
to spend time saying I think they're the
greatest thing to happen to the English
language it is dumb I don't personally
use emoji because I'm a 36 year old man
I love them I use them they're Japanese
I started using emojis when were they
invented two years ago three years ago
if you're like us you might not remember
exactly when emoji became a thing but
historians trace them back to the 1990s
to de como pagers they were huge in
Japan but in order to send and receive
de como emoji you had to have a de como
phone years later a standardization
system for characters called the Unicode
consortium came into play and in 2011
Apple added the Unicode keyboard to iOS
5 jump-starting emoji popularity in
Western country I asked my co-workers to
explain what they thought emoji meant I
think this one might be called to sumo
wrestlers sit on a bench together it's
hard to tell if what sex they are very
clearly birds disguised as ladies it
means that we're the best of friends
you're my favorite you're this one it
represents honor and culture and also
anything vaguely Asian so you could say
yeah I totally be down for hanging out
boom had you pull a for lunch today
feeling hey want to go get blank food
with me tonight
this appears to be some kind of monkey
that's playing hide-and-go-seek this is
the blind monkey which is very prophetic
in a way it's literally a monkey
covering his eyes but it means shut up
all this one's like oh no I'm so
embarrassed or shy or cute or adorable
nope
I saw my lunch is missing from the
fridge listen I'm gonna send you a
picture
monkey don't look at it in front of your
coworkers
Oh two white girls dancing they look
like they're doing aerobics but they
also have horns on their head like in
the shining when you see those two girls
down the long hallway here they are yeah
it doesn't mean what it looks like it
means yeah we're all friends or I can't
wait that we're gonna do something it's
like I wish there was one with like one
Asian girl one white girl but me and my
homie gonna kick it tonight with this
kind of thing like I love you girl
twinsies this one's like a hag oh that's
what it's called
I'm guessing this is a shrug she's
probably the sassiest emoji out there
her hand is like very strangely
positioned this means I'm just me being
me maybe she's like this is how much I
care about you I put it in my hand and
I'll eat it wait well pushed another guy
away today you need something for your
presentation who wants to go dancing
tonight
I create us
this is happy poop if I was flirting
with somebody and I just wanted to let
them know like I'm thinking about you
but it's casual clearly you're like I'm
into you but you're a bloop - it's
daytime you want to keep talking to the
person but you don't really have
anything to say so you throw poop emoji
congratulations
could just send this on its own not even
a sentence just blah blah blah blah poop
I think it's a little boy dreaming I
think he's like sorry we fall bow down
and mochi I don't know what this is and
these little triangles things that are
happening in some of these emojis are
kind of like the vibes going out oh I'm
so sorry that my dog ate your shoe
no this is the way it's going to be
we're meeting up at eight at this
restaurant the N my boo hasn't texted me
back this one's weird and that's really
the beauty of emoji you can use them
however you want no matter what they're
technically called</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
