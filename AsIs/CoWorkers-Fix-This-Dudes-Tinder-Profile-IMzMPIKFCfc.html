dating my name is Olivia and I spent
several months on several dating
websites including tinder hi I'm Devin
and I make a lot of profiles for all of
my friends and I met my boyfriend on
OkCupid my name is Cain some people at
the office call me the love doctor
because of the advice I give I've also
been in a six-year relationship with
someone I met online
hi yes to meet you panel now let's check
out the profile which sounds like needs
a major overhaul
you read us your bio buzz feeder slash
badass I make videos I mean I've had
like longer ones I had shorter ones
shorter than this yeah where are you
Cummings anyway so let's redo this first
off you should not say that you work at
BuzzFeed I'm gonna date you I'm more
care about who you are rather than what
your job is okay part of your
conversation is like getting to know you
if you already give them information
there's nothing for you guys to talk
about so let's let's erase what you have
Joe the awesome thing about you is that
you are interested in a lot of things
and you're like really cool to talk to
and your profile does not say any of
that I think you should be honest with
the ladies out there that you should be
like there's a girl who already has my
heart I'm her name is Stella yes bigoted
what's your favorite food for a date
like your sushi yes you cheat love
addiction can I use the word aficionado
yes oh my god if you make aficionado
into a pun Assoc aficionado oh pologize
for that one just say that in an in
brackets like show you're a real
personality or sorry had to yeah yeah
can you read it to us alright I'm gonna
be honest there's a lady already has my
heart
she's a cuddly pitbull named Stella
filmmaker sushi aficionado sorry had to
resonate badass
yes oh my god now that we fix up his
profile we're gonna look at his photos
no other girl there we go yeah is that
your girlfriend it's on your sister
that's more for you it's not for us yeah
I mean okay the first photo is too
filtered no bathroom selfie he's not
smiling yeah you kind of look like
frozen in on your body so right now
we're checking out Joe's facebook
profile so we can find better pictures
for his tender oh my gosh this is this
shows your face this shows your in a
very professional environment to a girl
be like okay alright that's the new
picture for you
cool now let's go see your messages so
what's the deal with this chica Tracey
we talked for a little bit and then she
I knew she was busy she said she was
busy and then we like we're gonna set up
a day and then there ever look she's
writing you that's a lot whoa she's
super interested dude how'd you
this up that's what I'm saying I've no
idea she I feel like you needed to give
her like exact dates about when to hang
out being like this Saturday like rather
than interesting like yeah let's hang
out the Saturday afternoon it's great
that like both of you guys like want to
hang out but if you don't take that like
actual step of defining it it gets lost
and fizzles out yeah or maybe let's
start a new conversation Khloe you
Gloria
clothes cute Khloe does like a cutie
might seem normal at first but upon
closer inspection actually quite weird
what if I swiped left on my soulmate
cute
that's Kia still a hard one to respond
to that but I mean she's quirky yeah
which I think opens a lot of doors you
can't be weirder than me I've made a
native a dragon picture yeah I have a
dragon picture
I see your weirdness I raise you one
dragon photo yeah that's good
how are you weird today is a good
question to follow through with that
sun-sin dude
uh-huh yeah it's good that we had a
question there so it invites her to
respond with more stuff and instead of
just saying yes or no also if it's going
well ask her on a date
do it like it say if you are having back
and forth for like a day I think you can
ask her on a date this weekend and with
all those pieces you can help keep your
conversation going instead of kind of
just dying in a slow death yeah thanks
guys I'm gonna take that stuff into
consideration excited by my new profile
I'll let you guys know how it goes yeah
