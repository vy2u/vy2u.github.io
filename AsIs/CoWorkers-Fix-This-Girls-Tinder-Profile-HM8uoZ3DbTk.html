online dating my name is Olivia and I
spent several months on several dating
websites including tinder hi I'm Devon
and I make a lot of profiles for all of
my friends and I met my boyfriend on
OkCupid my name is Kane some people at
the office call me the love doctor
because of the advice I give I've also
been in a six-year relationship with
someone I met online
hi I think when like looking at your
profile we'll see like how you're
representing yourself so we can help you
procreate your profile to get what you
want back just up here from New Orleans
I love hanging out coffee drinking
brunch I love film photography reading
and adventures this summary of yourself
could use a little work I know it's
tinder I know it's brief but I I don't
feel any of your personality can we
rewrite your pool yeah so the three of
us recreated her profile and she's gonna
read it to us I'm a Louisiana girl
living in LA better then put a little
South in your mouth oh I'm a filmmaker
who loves to create quirky shorts baking
enthusiasts and film buffs so if you
bring movie tickets I'll bring the
cupcakes you can take the girl out of
the south but you can't take the South
out of the girl haha
uh that one and then one with my guy
friends hmm I would take that photo yeah
I feel like a girl group photos maybe
better than the guy group yeah angry
yeah can we check out your messages now
Zacks been mesh messaging me a lot is
the thing about that is that he lied
about what he looks like
oh he's older yeah and that one's
definitely older are you not into him I
can't I don't know if you're not into
somebody on tinder don't message them
well he messaged me well no but you know
doors all I did was fun oh this one do
you want to show us one more yeah we can
go through other ones
yeah it looks let's click on a motorcy
oh that's funny if the first date goes
well let's open a joint checking account
well what if we got coffee person if
things go well we can plan a Disneyland
date he's so-so no I was like all right
fair trade what's your schedule I'm
awful at this but my number is Oh
this is so scary for me you guys I think
we're getting to the heart of the issue
here though because usually young people
are being too pushy it's actually
they're just interested in you Caroline
and I think you need to believe that
you're someone who is like valuable and
worth their their time and efforts you
know and don't go to date in like a
dungeon somewhere where you're gonna get
kidnapped go to a coffee shop near work
so that you can run out screaming if
it's a crazy person and it's somewhere
that you feel comfortable how do you
know he's a good guy right from this
meetup I mean he's he's a good guy
because he has consistently message to
you even though you said you you were
kind of not ready for it and he's like
he's still taking the time and effort to
message you back it was being nice about
it yeah back in your boundaries yeah
he's not like left you you're not
interested in yeah I'm so bad at dating
right now message him right now like
let's go out yeah let's go out
you're like scheduling my day yeah I got
Oh Oh pick you up man all right I'm
gonna send this okay message yeah
Caroline's profile didn't show how
awesome she was so we helped her show
herself I think the guys were great they
held natural conversation with her and
they were actually really nice
I think Caroline might have been a
little afraid to go on a date so we
helped her narrow it down and set one up
for herself this weekend well I hope I
go on the state and I'll let you guys
know you will oh and if not there are
plenty of guys out there that look good
like her adorable and have good
conversations with you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
