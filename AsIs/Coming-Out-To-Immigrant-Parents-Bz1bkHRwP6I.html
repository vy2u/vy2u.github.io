scarier you thinking you know this part
of me is different and what if it
changes the way that they see me my god
I was so scared all throughout
elementary school middle school in high
school I thought something was wrong
with me we all have this idea of what
gay looks like and some people when I
walk on the streets people look at me
and thinking I think that's been the
hardest part to kind of feel valid in my
own gayness I had feelings for guys I
repressed them but it comes out
eventually my parents struggle with a
lot in Vietnam even just trying to come
to America it does have a factor and how
difficult it was for me to come out my
parents both grew up in Mexico my mom
she's very religious from a very
conservative family I want to have a
life that makes them happy I didn't want
to impose that on my parents at all I
didn't want to stress them out my
parents were both from Karnataka India
one of the biggest things that you like
think about and talk about and base or
decisions on is reputation so when I
came out to my mom her immediate
concerns were what will the family think
as an immigrant she came here to the
United States with she had two suitcases
and $200 she would be a natural fit to
understand what it means to make
happiness on my own terms or challenging
my parents idea of what happiness means
in my life the way I kind of approached
it was like this is my girlfriend you
know I'm kind of knew it I hated
something and you waited so I was not
too surprised my dad immediately was
like really he's like I had no idea the
sentiment she expressed was I'm sorry
that this is going to make your life
harder for you because of other people
it was never I'm disappointed in you it
was always I want you to have everything
you deserve and this might be a block
they were furious they felt like they
couldn't trust me anymore and because of
that I felt like I couldn't trust them
anymore because I just dropped like you
know my deepest darkest secret to them
and they
I did not take it well at all my mom
started to cry and she said well I know
a lot of depressed people that became
gay and I think you're gay because you
haven't been going to church the last
four years my mom hired a Family
Therapist in hopes of getting me to
reconsider being gay I was like I'm not
gonna change who I am
she's like you're a bad person the
person that should be giving you
unconditional love is telling you you're
a bad person and my mom said that and I
I broke and I was just like fine you
don't have to have a son who's gay you
don't have to have a son at all I'm
leaving this house you don't ever have
to see me again my dad's like you will
not leave this household and he locked
the door and then they all came and
hugged me and they were like we love you
please stay and I just started crying I
didn't want to like hide this from my
mom until I'm like 40 and go to her
saying meet my fiance hey I'd like to
get married someday I want my
grandparents and cousins and aunts and
uncles to come since I came out to my
mom I think that she understands me on a
deeper level there was one night where
she said Andrew don't dig jerk guys and
I'm like okay mom a couple pieces of
advice that I would get is make sure
you're ready make sure you are prepared
for the worst reactions because
sometimes they do happen coming out is
still in some parts of the country and
in many cultures a very difficult thing
to do just accept it for yourself first
and then don't worry about anyone else
just accept it if you are struggling to
come out to your parents reminding
yourself that you are worthy of love and
perfect the way you are I have a lot of
faith in the fact that your reminder
will actually be from your parents it's
a growing and learning process for both
the parents and the person who's coming
out for those of you who are still in
the closet just have hope just know that
you're worth it that's what kept me
going love you mom
I was expecting so feeling there's so
many feelings</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
