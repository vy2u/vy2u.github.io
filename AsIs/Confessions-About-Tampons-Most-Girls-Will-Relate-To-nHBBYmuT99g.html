dramatically pretending I'm a doctor
injecting a life-saving drug into a
patient I once had to change my tampon
in the back of the car because it wasn't
a bathroom around pulling out a dry
tampon is a definition of hell I went to
my boyfriend put in a tampon for me to
test how much he loves me I'm always
really angry when I'm on my period so to
make myself feel better I shout
reloading when I change my tampon I put
in two tampons because I didn't want to
change my tampon at my boyfriend's house
one time someone asked me for a pen I
pulled a tampon out of my purse instead
this morning when I took my tampon out
there was still another string so I
pulled it it was another tampon once I
tried pulling out a tampon but only the
string came out I thought I was going to
die I've been having periods for 22
years and I still can't get the timing
down for when to change my tampon I roll
my eyes whenever I hear someone say
tampons are gross I'm pretty sure
sitting in your own period blood isn't
exactly clean either I like wearing
tampons because it's like I have a
secret nobody has to know about the
first time I tried to use a tampon I
didn't take off the plastic applicator
and cried for two hours Oh
tampons are not your friend the first
day or two after having really rough sex
my boyfriend put my tampon out once
thinking it was a string off my bathing
suit I hate it when I pull my pants down
and my undies are covered in blood then
I take out my tampon it has like one
drop on it you had one job
I don't always spill my tampon but when
I do it's because I've laughed sneezed
or put it in wrong and it about brings
me to tears one time I sneezed so hard
my tampon popped out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
