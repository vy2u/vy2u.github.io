I am Kelsey Darragh and today we have a
really cool guest I'm so excited
to have her here she's the host of the
throwing shade podcast soon to be TV
show hey I was just uh lacquering my
lips you're also the creator of gap
throw that's right tell us about that so
gay Thrones is where my hairdresser
recaps Game of Thrones
recapping it and kind of regurgitating
it basically to RuPaul's Drag Race link
that's the best way to describe it take
a drink do you want yeah I would love
you know what I would love please Tommy
a lukewarm this yeah yeah
I can't oh every dentist is just
 around right now so can you
explain to me like I'm an old person
what okay eight is for anyone that
doesn't know what shade okay so when
you're throwing shade at somebody it's
like you're giving this you're giving
them the side-eye without actually like
tell they've done they up but
you're not going to tell them they
 out it's usually reserved for
people who deserve it so we throw shade
at politicians usually conservative that
are that do anti-gay anti labia we throw
shade on those people the next dessert
but I never throw on you know god
yeah I idolized you
in the non creepiest way Yankee from
this uh yeah I mean you're doing it all
right thank you so much what do you
think is the worst state of Mississippi
or Florida it's a time I feel like the
PC thing for me to say right now is
North Carolina because they just passed
that but yeah the bathroom
discrimination law hey you know who the
bathrooms aren't safe from
Republicans Oh Ming I do to that okay
how would this marry kill ya Trump
Ramsay Bolton or the entire state of
Florida which high okay Ramsay
Bolton because sorry to say but our
skies for the best in bed that is to
kill Donald Trump Mary wait was a third
one the entire state of Florida sure
sure sure
great uh what's one television show that
you could watch for the rest of your
life it's the only show you watch
RuPaul's Drag Race
you like that Kate yeah okay yeah it's
so good and they have been calling out
how hard it is for these drag queens and
their lives and like where they've come
you honest I like that they're shining a
light on that if you have to uninvent a
piece of clothing what would it be and
ignored my list body body suits
oh that's nap in the crotch Harriet
Tubman's gonna be on the twenty cummins
yes yeah who would you put on the hundo
if you could I would put Sacagawea
because I think she really got the shaft
by being on the silver dollar it was
like carry this big piece heavy corn
around women uh if you want a strip club
what would you call it
holes anyone else your male strip club
and all of them would be covered except
for their holes let's just still it to
its finest point which is holes
everyone's just interested in each
other's holes I support that helping or
hurting Neil deGrasse Tyson I think he's
helping I think he's making a straw
Legere oh no no I didn't hear I think I
was helping astrology I think he's
making science cool he's great
don't helping I do love what he like
tears apart gravity is like excuse me
can happen Matthew McConaughey you can't
go into a library of time do you believe
in aliens yes but honestly is it a
little arrogant not to because you don't
know what happened in some Blake some
and you know the nebula gallery yeah now
I see here something like you're not
drinking alcohol right no I'm not
drinking alcohol and I never studied
science what's your most unpopular
opinion my dad's being on bett and so I
do believe you should support troops
even if you don't agree with why they're
fighting I think that's a pretty is that
pretty standard don't punish them for
the nonsense that the government what
are you most excited about for having
our TV show for a long time women and
gay issues have been presented on these
infotainment or political comedy shows
by men we're gonna be focusing on such a
narrow yeah part of politics that affect
all like more than 50% of the population
so I'm excited if you could give your 16
year old self advice what would it be I
went to a lot of shitty colleges and
then I had a theatre teacher was like I
really think you have um something we're
not going to save talent I just a few
years yeah I think every look I'm not a
doctor I know HPV Renekton what's the
worst advice you've ever been given to
give up my boyfriend in college said you
shouldn't try to do comedy it's how was
your time and he also said I wasn't good
at it
haha second fall you father
ah that's it thank you so you see it the
way we end this is we take a selfie with
this Polaroid oh great I'll take it over
here and then we hang it on our wall all
right any one two three cheese up we
didn't say anything too sad the world is
sad
it's an hour done</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
