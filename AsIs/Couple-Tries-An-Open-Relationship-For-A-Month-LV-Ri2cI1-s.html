I mean I'm not I'm not going to I think
I would turn it down thank you one are
we going get three would I would let's
just go for it
meet the whole dick no a whole dick of
life right eat it deep throat it we met
at an audition and then we were on a
cruise ship for like five months so
basically like we started a relationship
on a really long honeymoon I think it's
really rare when you're trying to focus
on making people laugh a lot for your
career that someone else really makes
you genuinely laugh very often I don't
say that's my big one to make me laugh a
lot I realized that I don't want to put
all my emotional baggage whatever onto
you if I spark with someone I want to be
able to pursue that without feeling
guilty trusting you to like go out and
be intimate with somebody else you still
want to come back feels like a deeper
level of intimacy use protection but
you've kind of said like don't fall in
love but I'm not sure if that's a ground
stop that I think we need to tell each
other every time we go on a date it
shouldn't conflict with our own dating
oh yeah we have a date what if you find
someone you want to date for a while I
don't know I feel like I feel like
that's just something we have to talk
about I don't want you to be unhappy I
hope you don't find someone you like
better but I also hope that my emotional
needs you know don't get in the way of
you being able to fully live and realize
yours because you know we're thinking
about marriage even and forever is a
long time
do you think this is going to improve
our relationship or tear us apart
all right so I've been talking to
somebody OkCupid I just don't know what
to do now I'm rising in middle school
like it's like you're just talking to
strangers on AOL Instant Messenger JD is
a little bit more excited to go on date
yes I gotta get out there he's got a
date for this region already and I did
feel it like kind of a dab of jealousy
LeAnn and I are starting an open
relationship what do you think about
that whatever makes you guys have I got
like at least three people I'm talking
to and I'm already like got a date for
Sunday night I almost feel guilty going
on a date with somebody who's not Lea
and it's kind of exciting I'm just like
worried that LeAnn's doing this overcome
her own insecurities or anxieties I want
this to be something that's fun that
we're doing kind of together my first
date you excited you don't seem excited
his presentation the right word we
haven't like talked about having sex
with other people I think I would turn
it down
thank you and are we you know I guess we
would I would okay you yelled the camera
I don't either I must got into this
because we're sexually unsatisfied least
I'm not oh I'm you shrugged
well I I mean like whatever sex it
wasn't just to have sex is what I was
absolutely katie has a date tonight I
don't know about it I am supposed to be
getting dates for myself
and instead
I'm inviting my friends sending out more
yes late tonight how does that make you
feel
did you just came back from his date my
first date was very neutral there wasn't
like a spark or whatever a connection
that I felt I realized that that's I
think what I was hoping what happened
it's a reality that you know attraction
occurs and then people been pretending
like it doesn't for a long time sex
isn't that huge of a part of a
relationship I think a lot of people
will disagree with you
it is important but just a small part of
life you're speaking now how you want to
be yeah that's how you manifest that
 got a date on Friday with a guy
from OkCupid I'm feeling good about this
one LeAnn's finally getting her toes wet
I guess and I don't she seems pretty
excited about it so that makes me happy
yeah it has a deep next week 10
Wednesday
tell me about your date she's good
grammar very fun I have a date tonight I
know I'm pretty excited are you you're
hiding in pillows right now first of all
I was like just jump in and do it cuz I
was like oh I'm gonna do somebody this
one I feel a little bit more excited
about right no those those weird blue
jeans you have but the crotch is on
bugged out I hope it doesn't like go
really well where it's like we were like
wanna hang out
long time and it's like so you're hoping
your date doesn't go out no wait how do
you feel about this I keep waiting for
bad feelings to start bubbling up and
for me to start to get worried to get
jealous to get me in secure I just don't
feel that way I just dropped a JD up on
his date that doesn't see that I was
talking about not feeling it hit me this
feeling of like not supposed to have
romantic fun with help me is it possible
to be open and happy like we're just
talking not stopping like really getting
along and we ended up like kissing at
the envious jealous tonight when or what
happens with the lead an adventure in i
JD had finally went on one like kind of
like well I gotta go and we didn't have
like a sexual spark at least for me but
she was so smart and so kind talked for
five hours I connected with her and I
want to talk to her more she doesn't
actually live here so I didn't want to
get sexual with her I just don't know
that I'm interested in being someone
else that I do like the idea you know
like it's my spark with someone that'd
be great but I don't want put on my my
plate trying to find people to spark
with me you helping I'd have a sexier
time I don't know like I guess has a
worried you like come home just be like
never again she went on that first date
I felt that was kind of like really the
major sense of relief for me where I was
just like okay it's not just me going on
dates it's not something she's doing for
me like this is something that we can
both explore I had a good time like I
don't really want to go pursue others I
feel like you wish that I was kind of
more into being promiscuous with others
because
you want to be I have like this fear
that like you're just doing all this for
me and I don't like that idea idea can I
do something for you what are you saying
it's true no okay when I say something
like hey I'm feeling insecure about that
JD's just hears me holds me a little
closer and pays a little more attention
it feels like we've actually been just
more affectionate I love you I'm looking
for evidence that this is the wrong way
to go it doesn't feel wrong I feel like
I'm falling more in love with JD
you know we're just having easier days
when we are together it's better if we
keep communicating and like really just
sharing and it's somehow has made us
even closer my first second date
we've been texting all week that he's
allowed to do whatever he want with his
dates I expect things to get done he's
like I'm gonna bring a date over to our
place to watch TV which everybody knows
is code for you know touch each other's
hearts
man I don't want to do it in my bed well
I told JD you like I didn't love it if
we could just make our place off-limits
okay second day yesterday we went and
got some like pizza and then had some
coffee I don't know what is it I'm I'm
trying to get out of it necessarily
we're just gonna lead like because like
I went on two dates now it's like you're
probably got a third date it's like
where's it gonna go to yeah what you
wanna no idea
doesn't seem like either if I say that
super enthusiastic about it I still like
the idea of like being open about it
like and welcoming like a positive
experience you know we're just open to
love as it comes that's great
I think we kind of realized that we're
doing this kind of thing as an adventure
together that fear of falling or someone
else isn't really there anymore I'm
about to go on date number three with
this guy it's kind of the Clarins like
date three I'm like what would a short
term dating mean or his expectations too
talked and joined each other's company I
don't know what's gonna happen
you got any dates since your last one
going out to the wedding by myself
tomorrow yeah I go in myself and I'm
kind of have my eye open and I was
dancing and it's not well is it gonna
happen and no he knows like I could do
this I just don't need to I don't know
we're coming to the end of this month
long journeys not really not that
exciting anymore I feel like my partner
is more attentive
and more loving and more interested in
me sexually and otherwise
experimenta success I guess I've been
getting out more meeting new people this
is exactly the opposite of what I feel
like I was taught is safe
honey we're both pretty content with how
things turned out how things are going I
definitely don't feel like I'm seeking
too much out anymore after the first
couple weeks and like going each of us
went on a date I went on a few dates and
it kind of just lost it kind of lost its
like lost like this frenzy and
trepidation I feel like we both kind of
come to this comfortable position of
yeah it's great we'll stay in an open
relationship but we're not gonna like
actively seek out dates I just keep
falling more in love with you
I think jealousy comes from low
self-esteem and I feel like I have a
higher self-esteem now you just have to
communicate and respect your partner and
be good to other people I just trusted
you to be there on this adventure with
me so even though it was scary I was
like we'll come out the other side okay
and we did we came out stronger</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
