melon what's up here
you guys are going down wow I'm like a
pretty excellent crop weight so is this
unfair
no she's terrible yeah no I but I'm
really competitive gonna be an even
match but also we're gonna win we're
making watermelon baskets whatever that
is
we're giving you 15 minutes what that's
already which racehorse know what go
we'll have a tickle handle that's it in
the center you don't know me already
messed it you don't want to have a
handle on your basket that's okay
deep in should I go um you know all the
way like if this craft had to do with
meat we might do better cut them chunks
out perfectly
no you're not go go
Jacob and I are really great at doing
things in specifics amount of times but
I'm really focused on the test you know
I good grammar that was a good English
hit this stuff kind of here yeah how I
was Lars you dump that water out look at
this look at that just like some it's me
that wasn't necessarily the best yeah
you guys are doing really well over
there Shh
seal column selected we're we're fine
I'll lock their like opinion like
Richard I know
don't look at my basket mess i star may
get letters okay wait here kick the big
thing safety first kids safety first
I'm trying not to mess this up and try
being the operative word
ours definitely has more teeth which I
think it is an automatic winner I'm
cutting some melon what I don't think
that's a good use of our time what do
you want me to do I think you should
make the letters or what like just put
them on sticks yeah what do we want to
say I lost gear this isn't fun
what is it supposed how is it supposed
to go on you cut it out of the melon oh
you're like like you yeah gotcha that
makes more sense
where's the bee you're hiding it don't
forget about my D
I'm literally it's cutting it out and
punching out three exes in honor of the
Vin Diesel classic film oh I am triple x
this is D is very fragile I'm making it
worse we're done Shh we can get more
work to do okay quick time's up hands up
we won no it's great
are you kidding me why is it messy
picture perfect our basket is
excellent as you can see here it's a
tribute to the vendee so classic xxx
as you can see we have three X's on each
of the X's in some max you know lots of
axis and perfect I make a quarter that's
enough out of you it's amazing it's
taller it's closer to God and he figured
out what cookie cutters are for it has
teeth I mean Diesel also has teeth we
won because we won look at it we made
this lovely watermelon basket I think
it's the clear winner
it's like picture perfect you could pull
it out of a magazine we have matching
orange accents we have a variety of
berries in the middle we're used to
competing together and I think it showed
teamwork</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
