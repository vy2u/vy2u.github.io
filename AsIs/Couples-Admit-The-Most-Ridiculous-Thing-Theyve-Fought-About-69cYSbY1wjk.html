I think it was a different party on New
Year's Day I was like I'm gonna give up
drinking for a month I said I would give
up chocolate for a month because
chocolate is her alcohol that's her it's
worse than alcohol for me probably about
three or four days into it I'm walking
to work I walk by like a Ralph's grocery
store and I look out of the corner of my
eye and I see that Jen is walking out
and you've got this clear container of
not just one but two giant pieces of
chocolate cake mind you this is 10:00 in
the morning so I start sprinting and I
don't think Steve saw the cake at this
point because he was like oh hey Jen
what's up well the word insane logic
that she would just dart to her car I
knock on the door I'm like hey what's
going on thought it was kind of funny
also kind of scary and then you just hit
me with you had whiskey last night he
had a little nightcap and I I saw and I
was very casual about it but Steve got
real sassy and pissed off I did actually
have like a drink the night before and I
didn't even realize that in the moment I
was just I was flustered by that it got
like pretty heated
Steve just stormed off I drove off we
ignored each other the rest of the day
when I got back home later it was like
it was fine we both just realize that
neither one of us is any worse than the
other because we're both kind of pieces
when it comes to doing you happy and you
know what the way that we celebrated I
poured myself a little Mike and it was
great Brian likes to rip his clothes off
literally rip them and shred them to
pieces
he'll have a couple shots next thing you
know his eyes get glazed over and he
starts like it's almost like you have no
learn to react you can't be arm's length
or he's ripping I haven't ripped
anything of yours yet I don't think you
ripped a necklace that name
I had like that seashell necklace ripped
family dance beats discarded of I am
terrified of scary movies haunted houses
I'm very superstitious whenever anyone
she's really scared of them I told Tyler
the only way I would go to Halloween
Horror Nights is if he never left my
side
to look for him and then when I turned
back around there's a walking dead
zombie right in my face and I
reflexively smack him across the face
she punched him in the face she punched
one of these guys it's paid to scare her
in the face and then I got more mad at
Tyler because I was that amazing how
could you let that happen
that was like actually the day after she
was like do you want to be boyfriend
girlfriend yes one day later she punches
his ami in the face and she almost dumps
me in the minions line so there you go
everyone fights a little bit as long as
you don't let resentment linger it's
totally fine to fight don't keep
anything in if the person is meant to be
with you they will accept your feelings
and with a pot in your flaws there have
been times where I'm like she's driving
somewhere I'm like sitting in the
passenger seat and I'm like did I leave
my sunglasses and I open up like the
compartment and there's like four
cupcakes in there and I'm like did you
just pick these up or are these just
like here all the time I doubt your
emergency pack she wouldn't answer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
