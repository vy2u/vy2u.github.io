will consider having children in the
future yeah we'd like to expand our
family naturally and also taken in a
child which hasn't been given the starts
life they deserve
okay so gender also my own female okay
I'm happy with a male baby or a female
baby if we have a girl though he would
spoil her and she would be a bitch so
much age of child I would adopt a
teenager I heard a teenager you think
it'll be fun yeah I'll be able to taking
a baby to me on the way baby's a little
work so yeah it's gonna be a lot of work
anyway American Indian or Alaskan native
all of them race ethnicity and I can
care what race is to be honest I don't
know about if they didn't speak English
so I wouldn't be able to communicate
with them that seems like a really scary
thing to be taking a child who doesn't
speak your language feel like that's
traumatic I'm gonna I'm gonna say no to
that one um okay dental problems may
include tooth decay missing teeth
crowded yeah I am gonna get that kid
braces tendency to reject father figures
well that's not gonna work okay birth
history low birth weight or premature
then my friend just had a premature baby
and they're just like so thrilled just
to have this beautiful little girl like
I'm already worried about if I would be
a good enough mother for like a healthy
baby I just think it's like it's its
little you would honestly be okay with
like a kid that had all these issues
then we don't know what it's like I'm
not a shitty person I don't I didn't
tell nervous about like my first kid I'm
having all of that stuff
our fetal alcohol syndrome baby oh yeah
that means that's when the mother was
drinking mental retardation mild
moderate severe yeah we will consider
that yeah it's all about um I think
nurture a severe profound mental
retardation okay hmm
I don't know if I have the resources and
the mental spike but that's where I come
in because I do okay means this really
the list that you go through this is
extensive I could probably try to work
with adjustment disorder but I couldn't
do autism no I could not it oh no about
schizophrenia I'll take that challenge
and when it's like you both have to take
the challenge it can be selfish you need
to be strong enough mentally to be able
to take that on as well I notice the
hair takes
to do with it there's a lot of patience
that breaks my heart child involved in
prostitution
I'd have to say yes yeah there's gonna
be some issues but like absolutely hands
down that would take that child child
conceived as a result of rape well yeah
we yeah that's fine chocolate seeds as a
result of incest
I say no anything incest I'm just it
depends if the child is held for you I
don't think I don't think I'm ready to
be a parent I don't think we're ready to
adopt a child this is too serious it's
really sad I mean you have to think that
if you have to go through this there are
children that fit
each of these boxes that everything
we're saying no to applies to a child I
didn't know how much detail went into it
and like about the mental state the
child or the hell for everything I just
thought you know you can just go adopt a
child who doesn't have a mom and dad so
many of these things like I've heard of
and know what they are by for some
reason you never think about them when
you think about children and raising a
child and having it's odd to me it makes
me just think about like do I get what
being a parent is about I love and
founder can definitely help result so I
think it's something that we still
doesn't want to do I think they should
actually use this for people who are
thinking about having kids too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
