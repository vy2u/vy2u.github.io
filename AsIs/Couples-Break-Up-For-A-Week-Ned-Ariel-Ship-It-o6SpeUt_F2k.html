all by myself
normally my wife is right there it's not
the same without her this week my wife
and I are going to live like we're
seeing drink a lot more why I'll be out
of town and I'm staying oh I'm not
replacing the decorative pillows
I think I'll win then I met could
possibly change that much I'm at the
airport it's snowy and rainy and that
reflects our current mood personally I
love being single it gives you for him
to do whatever you want whatever you
want I'm hoping we can incorporate what
makes us unique as simple people into
the context of our marriage I'm just
gonna be like a caricature of myself
rediscover who you were before you were
defined by your relationship and in
doing so I think you two can come back
together stronger than before okay
exactly
and now to face TNA oh here we go
Oh
feels weird I'm gonna put my wedding
ring right next to this super cute
picture of us that's right next to this
other super cute picture of us I already
can't wait for us to get back together
one of the things that I don't like to
do is eating by myself you eat when
you're hungry you're not scheduling your
meals around someone else whatever you
want whenever you want I'm eating off
cooked Ridgeville beer already living
the dream I definitely enjoyed the first
couple days because I could kind of do
whatever I wanted you cook when you're
single and you cook up the portion size
coffee for one but I'm drinking for two
if you want to sleep till 11:00 if your
body wants to sleep 211 you're sleeping
till light I wish and I normally go to
the gym in the mornings but I slept in
and didn't go I don't have to make the
bed because I'm on vacation any of your
old vices that went out the window
those are all fair game now go to bed
when you feel like it it's really hard
for me to go to sleep when that's not
there I've been avoiding going to bed
because that's not here I really don't
like being alone I'm getting a little
spooked being in the house all by myself
you hear that I've just been playing on
Pinterest oh god there's at least I can
set my thermos
to whatever I want you find that you end
up working more absolutely it's almost
11 o'clock I didn't have to call Ariel
and let her know where I was
I could just work she doesn't exist in
this world okay I'm skiing without Ned I
go to drive everyone home only to find
out that my keys not working and then
the alarm starts going off these two
boners are left with me so we need to
have the tow truck come and take the car
yeah you want to get it up it's a
beautiful day
look at this hey goodbye it was harder
to deal with this experience being
single because I didn't have the support
of a partner I did have the support of
my friends as long as you have a good
support network then I think you can
face any of life's obstacles what about
a guys night or girls night out with the
boys need that's just the night it's not
like this special once every month type
of thing no Friday night as a single guy
I'm hanging with my main man Zack here
with my gorgeous sister we'll see if
there's someone that looks like we're
talking to we will talk to them no no
everyone here this guy's big
even though being singles not for me
it's pretty fun to go out was that
there's anyone else that I'd rather be
with it's like that I apparently closed
the party so should Zack have hooked up
with that girl or not yeah he should
have taken that bath
oh damn I'm so hungover figure out your
weekend plan cuz otherwise are gonna be
totally alone I've got four hours to
kill before I have to pick Ariel up from
the airport I'm gonna do it they're my
little plan drinking out of my Britney
Cup no pants no problem going for a walk
right now going deep get it touchdown I
made a fire it's time to pick my wife up
from the airport
which means Oh
feels back to normal I'm a little early
so I actually parked the car and I'm
gonna surprise her by just like being
right next to the gate when you walk out
I've always wanted to get surprised by
someone at the gate here this is very
exciting
yeah yeah it's best day I'm very happy
that we're back I can't do yoga even in
the marriage we're still two unique
people and sometimes we both do our own
thing that's okay
you're my best friend your name is Ray
