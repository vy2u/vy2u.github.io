right you can tell me yeah I'm just
thinking I'm listening it I'm like oh
man what the hell is my church very
different today we'll be looking at the
charts of couples I love doing couples
because I get to look at two different
astrological charts and see where they
come together and where there might be
conflict is always something really
important to be gleaned and to gain as
you know you're both Pisces you're born
different years but you're the same sign
the different years really change the
charts a lot Pisces are really sensitive
you are
Pisces son and so you are born right at
sunset and that mark of sunset is the
mark of relationship they're the only
water sign in the zodiac that has no
protection they have the power to swim
away so Piscean people generally need to
like kind of roam and ramble around you
don't want to try to hold a fish Pisces
are really known for being dreamy and
romantic and poetic I think that sounds
a pretty accurate in a way I feel very
Pisces the whole time we're moving
around a lot and changing careers your
moon also is this really beautiful
combination of the goddess Venus the
goddess of eleven relationships both of
those things together tell me that
there's something kind of like easy
about being with you or maybe your ease
in terms of getting into relationship
you're set up you have a very feisty
directive sometimes combative but very
courageous mark right up front you've
got Mars on your ascendant so the planet
Mars is coming up over the horizon when
you were born and Mars is the warrior
Mars is the heroine Mars serves and
protects like a mama bear kind of
interesting and you both have this
really extreme situation this like calm
on the surface in terms of your like
emotional temperament but there's this
and we're up on me okay I've got
like almost everything else in Capricorn
the sign of
the mountain of achieving things in the
second house of money no sugar melon
when I look at your house of
relationship it's all in a very cool a
little bit emotionally reserved kind of
tone what that says to me is like I
would think you really want like someone
who's able to commit and like to have
interesting intellectually stimulating
partnership any what you're saying like
has definitely shown up in our
relationships a lot I'm not very
transparent so like a constant obstacle
that we've ran into is you not feeling
like you can read me very well I feel
that a lot of time I don't know how he
really feels the only time I seem
irritated was something really not that
important like you know in traffic whoa
but then that la traffic is a different
story yeah I know emotional triggers
that come up are most likely connected
to the family triggers that you had as a
kid how did my mom deal with anger how
did my mom deal with power I was I
taught as a child we see two very
different styles of beings and it can be
very beautiful and compatible your son
and Pisces and your son and Capricorn
get along really well your charts are
very compatible to have again to have
both the same son signs and the same
moon signs tell us that you have a lot
of need for the same things and so can
be an understanding of each other that
can be really seamless and intuitive
right so beautiful oh it's very
interesting that we are so opposite but
still very compatible and so there's a
lot of compliment here and there's
enough tension for it to be exciting and
interesting we hit the jackpot we killed
it
Cobra we won the game always we won the
astrology lottery
