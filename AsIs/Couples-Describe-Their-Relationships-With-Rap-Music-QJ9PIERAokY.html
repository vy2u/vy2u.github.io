kidding play essential totally I think I
would be playing you would be kid
yes he has a Run DMC shirt that I bought
at one time I do have run GM t-shirt yep
some gifts um I know some stuff know
some stuff there's some Ghostface in our
catalog there's some wu-tang in Jeff yes
yeah everything's gonna be Ice Ice Baby
on a scale of vanilla ice 2jz vanilla
ice being one and jzb ten great your
partner's ability to cook milli vanilli
milli vanilli but here's the thing
Milli Vanilli wasn't all bad they were
kind of like a fun summertime band it's
just that sometimes they went a little
like off recipe you might even say
you're gonna say for me like a rapping
stork that raps about dairy products
that's the level I think I'm an old
white man in a corporate training tape
wrapping negative what you guys we
didn't fake this this is real I feel
like he rated me kind of low like three
hahaha I'm gonna say a solid 5 he gay
haha I said Eddie Murphy cuz I thought
that was fun
didn't he have this dog horrible I don't
think she thinks I can cook anything and
she's right
I put ice-t because I've never heard him
rap and I've never seen Tyler cook but I
love him on SVU I gave her ja Rule which
I feel is like really middle of the pack
which rapper would your partner leave
you for I think you're gonna put mm ha
ha ha I'd say it's Eminem do you see it
now Tanya Lupe okay yeah it was a really
easy one okay honey but she is not a
gold digger okay Sophia's about
personality Lil Kim your face yeah
right
Kim and and like you know I'm little
she's little I just said Kanye with the
question mark here is why I know I just
think you should be with a rapper who
can really support your artistic needs
what popular dance best describes your
relationship the monkey from Johnny
Bravo the Bernie maybe something like
that
possibly bernie is because it's a really
silly dance move and it's floppy and
relaxed if you say twerking were single
ha ha ha ha
I think Bryan put Macarena yeah
Superman is you're like my Superman you
what's the only thing your partner
actually wants for his / her birthday
for Tyler I don't think it's a big booty
ho what oh oh okay yeah we all know what
yours is so you spend it all go first a
beach is that what you want like yeah a
blowjob uh
overnight in the princess suite at the
Disneyland Magic Castle to be treated
like a pretty princess forever so kind
of yeah but you do that everyday
ah and you know you do stuff to it a
massage at Disneyland in parentheses at
the same time I just want to sit down
and watch Netflix the new season of Game
of Thrones that is exactly what I want
we killed it we killed it I think I
think we I think we just have to have an
album now I think we just need it just
like yeah wait do or do our album cover
pose I feel like I would be like this is
here nineties album yeah feel like I'm
in the front
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
