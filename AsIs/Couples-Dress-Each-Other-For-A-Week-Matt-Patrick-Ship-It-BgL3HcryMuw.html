for a week I can't mess this up too much
that's anything okay
matt has either plain t-shirt graphic
t-shirt or like a checkered button-down
definitely something you could see a
mess closet patrick has a lot of clothes
in just closet if I go to the store and
something fits me well I'll buy like
nine that would definitely be like a
gladiator in Olivia Pope's office suited
up ready to go do battle in the
courtroom I think in general it's just
dressing them up a little bit more I
take the shirt back take it off I don't
like it
sizing is always weird because I'm
pretty tall finding shirts that are long
enough but not like stupidly baggy I
think the biggest thing for Patrick I
want to get him to retire a few items
from his current repertoire just he's
freshen that up a little bit this should
go why they're very old maybe we can
make him look like one of the like hip
young scientists on the flash in this
job it doesn't have to be super dressy
so I'd like to find him things that can
like be sort of business casual it's
kind of adorable but also looks like
it's a dental hygienist obviously I
should get it I grew up a very
overweight kid so I'm very always
conscious the way the clothes hang on me
something that I think Matt doesn't
think about as much Matt and I are gonna
have a lot of fun with this but I also
think we're gonna learn what we think
about ourselves and what we think about
each other and I think that's an
important thing in a relationship
Patrick gave me a very nice ensemble I
got a lot of compliments the problem was
the tie I'm not good at tying ties and
so I kept messing up it was really
stressful and I was late to work Patrick
had to fix it after dinner we're on day
two today we are going out so that gave
me a shelf for my drink and so I
appreciate and
dressed up here just right there I mean
I'm from Texas that was a big buckle you
know Matt and I got the shirt as a joke
but we both kind of agreed it's cute
what are you doing uh what I didn't want
you to wear tomorrow with dressing
myself I like know everything that's in
my closet and have a good idea but yours
that's like painstakingly go through
every piece Wow this has been fun and
we've actually learned a lot about each
other through this process
um I'm looking forward to choosing my
own clothes again rather than feeling
like a kindergartner and having their
mom pick out the gloves I'm in like a
little sweater with a button-down shirt
combo underneath you've been looking
incredibly professional lately you know
you've just been sending out like a star
in this office people think I should
dress like this all the time so that's
great but I'm not going to because it's
too hot
man calm down I was going to dancing at
the stars today he decided for me a bull
Black Tie attire everyone at work all
day today thought I was going on a job
interview and I told them I only Robin
is Ryan Seacrest didn't want you to look
like a fool I appreciate that he doesn't
always think that through the same when
he's getting dressed huh
it was both easier and harder than I
expected it to be his sort of general
trend for me was to dress me up more
when you got calm yeah I got compliments
so I'm probably maybe a little more
inclined to do that just not everyday we
talked about a lot of stuff that I feel
like hadn't really come up it definitely
like started us on conversations about
why we like to wear what we like to wear
and I thought that was important to like
learn that about each other I'm still
probably gonna throw some more stuff out
though of mine yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
