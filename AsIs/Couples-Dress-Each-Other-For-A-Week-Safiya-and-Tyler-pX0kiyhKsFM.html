are styling each other right I'm gonna
look like Tyler sister for a week I'm
actually like pretty dressed up today
what I usually wear is like a t-shirt
probably a v-neck and gym shorts you're
a warm guy my goals in life are to get
to the point where I can wear Hawaiian
shirt and it's acceptable I wear a lot
of trendy pieces a lot of dark colors my
favorite shade is black tell me it's not
a color shade yeah all right Tyler
what's your plan for Sofia I think sauce
adapting like a little bit it's like
Queen a darkness thing which I'm like
pretty down with I'd like to mix in some
like brighter colors like I know that's
not perfect queen of darkness but I'd
like to see how it look Tyler was a prep
now he's kind of sporty but the gym
shorts have got to stop something that
he couldn't go straight from bed to gym
in would be great I've been too hard no
so I'm wearing the outfits off got me I
got this white chair with the splotches
on it and a pair of jeans so today he
made me wear this like shoulder patty
top a little skinny it's a little
uncomfortable when I was sitting in the
office but it's pretty much something
that we're all ready so I don't know
what he's going for
I learned that Tyler likes shoulders I
like shoulders go into Costco and I
think I look ready for Costco I have a
pair of pants on I look very presentable
human being
I mean I'm into the shoulder pads always
down for a good shoulder pad I've got
this flannel that I'm wearing this off
got me it's kind of like a blast of the
past for college Tyler today Tyler's
chosen this turquoise strappy top and
then
secrets down there he's definitely going
for the sporty thing very warm more
comfortable than that other shirt I'm
very comfortable it's definitely not
something I would ever wear to the
office gifts off likes it I might wear
more I'm just interested to see as the
week goes if he'll just like lose steam
because day one was awesome and day two
is kind of like clothes you know just
clothes
okay so it's day three Tyler today shows
a white tank top with the leggings and
my Birkenstock sophia picked out this
gem for me she said you know it's more
of a style she wants or it's a
button-down they say you know dressed
for the job that you want I think that
that makes sense for me to go and work
those cash the top is kind of like a
loose and flowy and tunic we had a
couple meetings today
it definitely looked more professional I
get why Tyler wears shorts every day
he's put me in the yoga pants every
single day so far and I'm having a great
time I will say that today was probably
Tyler's worst day he bought these pants
that I don't like these are like
straight out of Beetlejuice pants
literally want to take another look
I don't like drawing a lot of attention
to my hip I applaud him for taking a
little bit of a fashion risk but I don't
think that today was the best day oh
yeah we went shopping in Vegas you did
that whole thing often Jessica Tyler
serving at the last time we were in
Vegas trip a short nap so
it looks like because we were going to
Britney Spears right and so soft
basically deemed to everything I had not
Britney caliber it's cute right um Tyler
picked out my outfit he's every job I
may have made some faces to prompt him
is this good stuff joggers shirt tucked
in maybe we're a little higher knows
it's a little scandalous I will say but
I'm pretty into I think that my goal for
the week was just to get him in pants
there was a day where I went home it
launched it changed out into t-shirt is
she likes when I wear pants and she
likes when I wear a button-down and it
was kind of fun I felt like I was in
like a pseudo fashion show every time I
was like dressing up I definitely have a
very high respect for suffuse I I think
that Tyler's opened Pandora's box with
letting me dress him because now I'm
just going to try and dress him
