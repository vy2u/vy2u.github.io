week we are going to pick each other's
outfits for an entire week Jesus take
the whole car we've never really had a
big blowout we've never even like
thought wow it looks like I'd say that
my style is like edgy feminine I mean
I'm almost always wearing black if I
dress a little edgier a little harder
than I get less attention from dudes and
more attention from like women she has
basically nothing but black and white
tank tops I don't really trust your
style but I'm just I'm just putting it
out there I'm sorry
Wow I love very feminine girls very
small and I'm very insecure with that
sometime I want to see her wear less
black skirts dresses yeah I had never
seen her wear a skirt I've never seen
her wear a dress or romper IPT is a very
bright girl very smart but these are
dumb decisions I describe my style as
writing this line between feminine and
slightly masculine on Blakeley
yeah like tomboy chic I was chubby when
I was younger and once if that kid all
was a fact
Michael is we're gonna make Taylor look
dapper and she hates the word dapper but
she's not here right now look it's me I
am the captain there it's very Harry
Styles I want to make it a little more
Justin Timberlake a little more
form-fitting I want to show off her body
I'm pretty insecure about my stomach
like love-handle region does she think
she is a muffin top
spoiler she does not have him up in time
I said when the person you love doesn't
look at themselves the way that you look
at them because I think Taylor's like
always like a 20 out of 10 I'm picking
out her outfit we have this lovely
number it can take advantage of this and
apply a more Brown you look like a giant
piece of brown turd we're literally
wearing the exact same thing we didn't
plan it I promise I got my first
compliment on the outfit you looking
dope it so topes out we just say it
sushi and I had a lot of soggy and I'm
drunk so I'm today I'm in this romper
that I own that Taylor likes that I've
never worn since I moved it's really
hard a good about wearing it you know
you just pick the whole thing off Taylor
looks so good
look how form-fitting look how great yes
I feel like a 90s acid-washed teenagers
ah feel like I literally am dressing
five years under my age yeah
just gotta cool it is what Tuesday
morning and has gotten dressed and an
awesome little romper like I look like a
housewife no I think she looks great
there like as a very large forehead
which is why I always always always wear
my hair down this is the first day and
like almost ten years that I'm showing
my forehead to the world around I guess
when I agreed to do this video I didn't
expect certain aspects to suck so much I
absolutely hate being at the mercy of
somebody else telling you what to wear
because what she's picking are all
things in my closet that I don't like
that I never wear and I honestly don't
know why I haven't just even gotten rid
of them yet it makes me feel like does
my partner not find me attractive and
then it's like you know I kind of feel
more insecure than I did before we'll
see how this feels in the morning and
I'll wear this outfit hailer pictum
hopefully I'll be cool
today I'm rapping what I like to call um
coven chic this is a sailor's hat and
she hasn't
like this shirt and skirt and the shoes
it's one of the caught to this that's
cool we dis appreciate these
form-fitting pants we have going on how
many compliments have you got
so far out live
no we like bought a couple times during
this I think that it was probably the
most open and communicative and that
we've been I think we're even stronger
now yeah and look Taylor has an
accessory necklace going on her choice
and everything we come a long way I get
this non-black non-raven an ice
experience to kind of open up more
communication as long as the clothes
come off I'm happy so whatever</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
