head
matchy-matchy couples outfits it's all
the rage in Korea but will the people of
La find it adorable or deplorable its
ladylike and we're wearing the same
exact as our boyfriends for a week
because dating us isn't torture enough
having soft shoes for me it actually
sounds like I got my week boat who says
I'm choose and you were misinterpreting
this in Korea when couples just the same
is pretty much like marking your
territory I don't have a problem with
that
I'm very territorial oh we're black even
though it's the summer and it is dry the
tried I'm gonna make you wear skinny
jeans whoa make what
no I'm missing something we are gonna go
shopping together yeah
and buy matching stuff I'm not dressing
you me where II did that well we also be
wearing looser jeans
cuz I'll make you wear those making each
other we're know sort of like siblings
don't think that we have a siblings are
dating problems I'm just saying like if
we're weren't enough and I won't move a
big what oh well let's go shopping don't
make me mad okay he's already
have a very similar style but our tastes
in colors is very different I like
neutrals and blacks I like pink and
brights
I liked this idea but then the pocket
was navy blue and I'm open to whites and
neutrals but you you guys know that I
can't wear these I'm pretty okay with
navy blue like it actually might be one
of my favorite colors we actually we
walked in fall said ah color damn it
what to can't Sam you can wear it I just
don't want to we're only getting boy
stuff and I'm just wearing boy stuff
we're expecting everyone to think it's
weird in Mike you know I really think
it's cute hmm they might also we have to
get matching boxers to or is that all
juice okay just all thanks I'm go for
sleeping they look okay so it's day one
it's our first day out on the town
LS it bad to come meet me and we're
gonna go to lunch we're hanging out in
ecology area lots of college-age kids
looking at us kind of funny I'm not
super worried we'll see how I feel once
we get out into the elements
Wayne is that your mom dress you up or
something
it's cute I'm waiting for a group of
little walk by and start laughing at us
that's already happened we're back at it
again in our stripes numbers this time I
like this shirt okay please
truthfully here let's make it full skirt
we're standing around in his and hers
outfits with a selfie stick
so where's crusty we're looking for
crusty our friends apartment building
had like his grand opening they had
puppies for adoption just us holding the
puppies as a unit dressed the same I
want to say maybe like two or three
strangers just like took pictures of us
I accidentally ended up matching with a
different boy at were an IT guy was
actually wearing the same shirt oh
really
it's an H&amp;amp;M guys shirt it's a popular
shirt we're currently at fourtner's
right now wearing matching Hawaiian
shirts get it hey hey we know everybody
and like literally no one has said
anything about our matching shirt give
it a minute
first I'm just like that stupid thing
and I was just like alright that's kind
of cute that's kind of key I was like I
want I want to do that with somebody and
then I was like oh I ain't got go by
Saturday nobody even noticed that we
were matching because we just had plain
black tanks on which is definitely our
weakest day but sunday was molded
alright I think that we are
we're doing the most the hats are the
most we just got it first oh my gosh
that was our most brutal experience yeah
definitely that was fun
our shirts have Marvin Gaye on them I
feel like Marvin's kind of judging us a
little bit yeah look at his face
so Tyler
and he's decided to put his hat on
backwards
damnit all the house magic hats really
for some reason there were like Wayne
hats I like just been having hankies had
then it's like okay didn't they like the
Yankee the hats were cute we chose a
restaurant as on Hollywood Boulevard we
give at the restaurant amid surge of
water and they're like really this bro
she's from here I'm here got mistaken
for tourists a lot mm-hmm that was weird
these were the electric blue shirts that
you chose because you wanted to throw
some color into the mix yeah look where
I got it for our last date we decided to
do a big we're both wearing matching
Venice California jerseys now neither of
us are from Venice we don't really go
there either
mostl bridge um so you know Santa Monica
doesn't thatís really yeah there you go
we actually got a lot of reactions for
the his-and-hers situations so we're
just ask me if we got these made custom
imagine if we've done that last name is
Venice what's coming to an end
back to individuality which is why we
fell in love in the first place I'll
kind of miss it a little bit and we miss
it too it was definitely a long extended
inside joke I understand some people use
it to tell other people they're dating
but I know we're dating and I don't need
like extra recognition of that there was
less PDA this week because dressing the
same was all of the PDA tamal the PDA
they were like oh they're a couple and
then added the identical clothing was
like oh let's not talk to them yes they
are deeply in love they're really a
couple weirdly I think that this is a
thing that people do in America but just
for families as we were wearing our
striped shirts and our hats I was like
we just look like a mom and dad so we
thought long and hard about getting her
a little feral cat into an outfit but he
scratches like another effort you really
have to do some cost-benefit analysis
with that like the cost will be your arm
I definitely think that this week
affected our relationship and a
the way it was a cool bonding
opportunity because we sort of had to
navigate other people's responses
together the inspiration we had to get
crusty into a shirt will be that much
greater when we have a little gub-gub
kid that we want to put in their shirt
he will try matching PJ's yeah okay we
totally do matching PJ's matching
onesies even with or without bunny feet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
