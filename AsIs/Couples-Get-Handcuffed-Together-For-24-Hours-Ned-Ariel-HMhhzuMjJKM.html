we're going to get handcuffed to each
other for 24 hours it's happening people
refer to relationships as like oh the
old ball-and-chain you don't feel that
way no I like ignite with that what
happens when we physically cannot leave
each other's company what are the world
we got to be handcuffed okay it's got to
be 24 hours right you are allowed to
separate for extreme circumstances I
have to poop you're not invited you have
to document why we got to pick a hand
and stick to it
I choose my left hand I love you so much
I won't make it a day actually being
handcuffed to Ariel might cause some
friction would you do the honors
3 2 1 ah okay I'm to start our day I
have to get my stuff okay let's get your
stuff right I got the door thank you so
far it feels just like holding hands but
it's like a little more awkward sup we
went out with some friends tonight and
played Catan we were very mean to each
other in Catana I really just want to be
not near heifers oh I like his he's such
a jerk it paid off because I won the
game I think it'll get really really
awkward I have to shirt off so you're
gonna sleep like that every skin legally
well I thought yeah like we're gonna
take our handcuffs off because I don't
think we can take our clothes off and
get into our pajamas without it I don't
know what this experiment Oh we'll see
what it's about when we're done with
 around we've ever brushed our teeth
before I have to wait for Ariel to be
done I have like eye cream and stuff
yeah cancer it's a process area oh she's
gonna cuddle over on this side
what's that you need something yeah u
mad u mad bro
I normally put my arm around my oh there
are you just to turn off the bedroom
light Oh easy easy easy
got it got it nailed it goodnight god
that's a disaster we can't find a
comfortable position we might have to
give up but we're gonna keep trying
how did you sleep last night okay yeah
we sweet were able to fall sleep with
handcuffs on and then in the middle of
the night like my shoulder was really
stiff yes I haven't moved it at all I
was just like ah took them off but now
we're back
working on our computers here and
techniques a little hard using the mouse
is fine pooping is gonna be tough
Ariel I've had coffee disengage you
should wait outside the door though but
don't listen I got it I got it
some things are best left private
probably what we would be doing anyways
Deaton's guns we can have a little bit
of art today tomorrow oh so okay okay
figure that out
I'm so really I'm kind of deadweight
when you're working this makes
everything so much harder yeah I'll get
the screws as well
it's like explaining every single thing
that you're doing we're 20 hours in I'm
really kind of getting getting sick of
the handcuffs sort of like it makes you
want to not do anything because
everything is harder I just want to do
what I do and I don't want to have to
tell Ned and convince him to do it with
me
we had a breakdown
you know I can't be canceled in again
man man man
ha ha what if I don't let you in the
house I don't know I have a logic gates
house I feel like it should be pouring
rain right now I'm calling a sign
meeting like please let me let me in I
would love to take these off right now
but I would really really like to take
Pete huh
we can do it Ariel okay we spend a lot
of time together but I also feel like we
need to be alone to recharge late some
men yes they're digging in it I really
knew that yeah I really really have been
going crazy neighbors driving me insane
um Michael if we're at the finish line
two more hours left in our crazy
experiment so we just need to cook the
dinner and have our friends over be
great hey I thought it was gonna be easy
I mean we normally spend every Saturday
with each other yeah like no big deal I
never realized how
valued like my long time even when we're
hanging out together yeah we might be
hanging out in two separate rooms
yeah do two different things yeah my
lovely wife Ariel
it was a horrible experience but there's
no person I'd radish here go ahead
haha at 7 p.m. at 7 o'clock
we did it yeah that's over thank
goodness
yeah I was rough it was really rough I
gained a greater appreciation for some
of the hobbies that have been building
and joke about not wanting to be more
than TV from jail
actually not to be firmly
I like doing things together just
yes
it's also nice to poop in private yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
