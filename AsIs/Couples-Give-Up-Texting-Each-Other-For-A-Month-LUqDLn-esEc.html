thing in my life you have the most
perfect and I love you are my you're and
I'm obsessed with you baby
we text any given day like a hundred
times today it's been like fifty and
it's been like three hours next thing is
pretty much how we communicate
throughout the entire day until we're
back home together we text if we're
pissed off at someone we're pretty young
in our relationship here texting is just
a way to like make that connection like
so strong so we're just getting rid of
the easiest way to communicate does this
mean she can't send me like a photo
yeah that's text what am i what just
happening nothing happened all right
I wasn't texting Jen at all I was
grabbing my phone he was just texting he
was just about to text Jen and I caught
him my phone rang and was very excited
cuz I knew if my phone was ringing it
was him but then the call didn't go
through and we couldn't hear each other
it already feels like a lifetime of not
texting him it's 8:00 a.m. and stealthy
Steve ate my cereal and I tried calling
him he's not responding and I'm so
hungry it's the second day and I've
already had the impulse to text and he
like five different times I think this
is gonna be a little harder than I
thought the calls just cut out like we
tried three times and now I think we're
just giving up you might rethink calling
this video couples don't talk for a
month I just caught myself mid text
super super close to it's a texting Jen
I may have to like delete you from my
phone and just remember your phone
number and call you do you know my
father know half the time our
conversations are just hello can you
hear me I just came from a fitness class
and the guy next to me fell off the
treadmill and it was hilarious
I really wanted to text Eve about it I
saw the coolest dude ever this like 80
year old man wearing a pot leaf hat and
just chilling I was like hey can I take
a picture he said yeah sure immediately
I wanted to send it to Annie but I can't
text her now I've been waiting for him
for 20 minutes
and it really sucks that I can't text
and I'm having a drink where Ben and I
had our first date
I love detective but I cannot do that
it's strange not talking throughout the
day and I look forward to this being
over Annie and I haven't text each other
at night it feels like a part of our
relationship
it's like diminished right the halfway
point and we have not texted each other
once we have not broken at once I'm
proud to say but it sucks yeah we count
up a little bit we ethically failed 24
hours after we shot the first video your
text no hopefully from here on out we're
going to really focus on taking this
seriously there's so much that I should
be telling her that I'm not and I'm
gonna forget by the time I see you later
I don't know if Jolin has been fed Jolin
have you had dinner
my coworker just asked Ben if he is
coming to a little party I plan I guess
I forgot to tell him about it
it's been pretty hard not texting Annie
but I think I'm doing all right what do
you think yeah when we see each other
it's like oh my god it's you so we're
less than a week away from the challenge
being over and while it would have been
way easier times to text him I've kept
to it this has actually become pretty
easy and we're getting along great we've
been spending a little bit more time
just face-to-face she and I have been
talking on the phone a lot more and I
like it I have decided I'm going to
write a book it's gonna be called where
the f is Steve Cantor it's gonna be sort
of like Where's Waldo except that you
never find him
we did it we succeeded we really hit our
stride like midway through and then just
like an attic we relapsed I think you
said I need my gym shoes that was the
text that broken I don't know that we
learned to communicate better we just
learned that we can get by with
communicating who out left we definitely
hung out a lot more and spoke on the
phone a lot more but made me appreciate
the ability that we have to stay in
touch as much as we do normally trust me
is actually that we're also each other's
go-to person for like oh this person did
this stupid thing and we can't do that
yeah I think initially we'll definitely
less than we did before I disagree I'm
like raring and ready to go again I
don't know if I'm ready to just never I
can't do it we'll take it slow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
