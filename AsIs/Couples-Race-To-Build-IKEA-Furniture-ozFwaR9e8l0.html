ruin anything with us you know enemies I
think we're gonna win I think we are I
think we're totally gonna win I've never
built IKEA furnitures I don't have that
excuse I've built IKEA furniture thank
you actually read the instructions I
just modeled up it no you should read
the inspection let's go let's go by
instructions so it's like cooking in a
kitchen if you want the most efficient
way to cook is to like put all the
things out and then you can just take
them when you need them
we just understand each other very well
yeah so you don't need to over
communicate things no you can just like
point look ahead to the right for that
next weight physically on the wrong side
side we just did it upside down by
mistake oh no this is supposed to be
flush with this No why would this smooth
side be not showing we probably gotta
communicated better you don't be a great
start is to have this facing the right
the same direction as the instructions
because I'm looking at it I'm having to
flip my mind around yeah do it you know
I really think that it's just all about
communication also I think we know like
our own cues for when we're getting
frustrated so we know like quickly
wouldn't it be like it's okay or trust
me you know I mean knowing when to like
cede power to the other person is a big
thing too you know if you're unsure
about a thing but they feel strongly
about a thing letting them run with it
and trusting them you know I mean maybe
I'm wrong but feel pretty good about it
known her a long time I know her to be
smart and capable stay positive stay
positive okay we're almost caught up to
the spot that we were at a second ago I
don't really understand what this part
is I don't feel like we have those
pieces we thought we did something wrong
and it turned out we went
okay two problems out there weren't
there to begin with um I think a lot can
learn from that yeah don't let IKEA
furniture tear you apart it is is the
MLS real the theme of today ideas like
love the instructions aren't always
clear sometimes you think you're doing
it wrong but at the end of the day you
built a desk together</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
