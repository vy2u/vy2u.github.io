other not really what well you know when
you love somebody and you see them all
the time
we've been together for eight months now
eight years eight years we've been
together for two years married for
almost a year it's cool take your time I
know I'm perfect I knew exactly what was
gonna right I didn't have to think about
it for a second
I mean we're about to find out she wants
me to communicate mauryans talk about my
feelings money it's not bad at all I
wrote that you mess up the toothpaste
really like it squeezes it I try to like
do it from the bottom to the top so you
get what sit down on the bottom and like
it's done when it's done he like
squeezes at the top and just like messes
up my whole system and the whole place
has to be clean but I leave like little
messes was that in yeah that's true have
you ever seen almond milk when it dries
it like turns into sludge so like this
spoon just cuz it's so gross I say I'd
putz around its a PUD thing but she's
like fidgeting you say Pat thing what
are you even doing you're just moving
things from one side of the table to us
on the table no I'm getting things nice
but it doesn't make me feel like you're
listening what I am listening putzing is
the thing that my dad does my dad does
and my maybe it's a dad thing I
don't know like you're about to hear
you're like what you're gonna be I did
like eventually you'll become one my
guess is that that poor it it says I'm a
food ball I'm not foods only I'm a good
cook if I forget something and I give
him the plate of food and then I'm like
no let me add he's like no food bully I
want it just like this food boy come on
you know snoring yeah you see this like
it's a nice like little petite girl and
it's just like the noises that come out
are just I've actually woke myself up
before with my snoring I can't say
anything else without getting in so much
trouble
no you won't be in trouble
oh yeah that's true it's great because
you like lets me know how much time she
wants to spend with me all the time so I
feel really guilty if I'm not hanging
out with you really because you're not
doing anything but you you sound so sad
music I'm never sad about it I didn't
know that you were reading that as sad I
was texting you that as in like I've
done it I've succeeded in being alone
it's the best well good then we just
started through this though yeah I don't
care okay I learned that I need to
squeeze the toothpaste from the bottom
well I learned that the cereal bowl
thing is a big deal which I was not
aware of I mean I think if those are the
two things that are pet peeves in a
relationship it's not too bad I think
the key to dealing with pet peeves is to
discuss them I think it's like spinning
it so that everything like becomes like
a weird quirk of theirs that doesn't
drive you crazy it's about picking your
battles it's about knowing maybe this
could make my life a little easier but
you're not gonna try to change me and
that's so not easy
you're good the way you are you don't
need to change ya know I still love you
I still love you
hmm I hope he's fun I'll wear and wear
with birds</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
