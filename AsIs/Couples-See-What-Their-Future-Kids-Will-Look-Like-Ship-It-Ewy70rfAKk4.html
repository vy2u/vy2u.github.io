a little over four years like a month
over for you yeah four ish we have
talked about babies just in general
senses like babies walk by and soft goes
hysterical babies in the future yes yeah
we're gonna have kids in in the next
three to five years
not that long babies in the present
shammgod I'd want the baby to have
Jenna's eyes because they're fierce and
they're emotive I mean I do love his
face but I would like at least my nose
cough is uh Indian and Danish her nose
my head I am Welsh and Chinese I'm
curious just to see what you guys came
up with but it might who knows feel
excited I'm excited too I mean this is
gonna be my future baby this is what
he's gonna he or she's gonna look like
exactly so oh my god that's my I tell
you something yeah I kind of want to
care for this child now is it reading a
guy it looks like a guy yeah it even has
a your beauty mark if a nose comes out
on the baby like that is too much this
wasn't always like this it grew as in my
head good this is my baby skin my baby
skin is on this baby
Aziz William as these Williams ZZ Susie
Williams that's a cool name
it has one of your eyebrow from what am
i I didn't know how excited he was gonna
be about seeing this baby about seeing
the baby not having the baby I just want
to make sure this is crystal clear
listen your kid is gonna look a hundred
different ways and there's a lot of
things that can happen and as long as
it's your child you're gonna love it you
look at this we say that's not really
our kid and then we had to say well that
is our kid right and then we stepped
into the parenting gear so I'm confident
that when stop and I
you know go down that path will do a
great job</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
