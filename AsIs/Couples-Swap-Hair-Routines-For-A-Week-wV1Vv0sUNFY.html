got to go they will not be missed
I'm Taylor and we've been together for I
am going to try to mimic every single
little thing she does for her hair and
you've got to do the same for me my hair
routine is pretty simple
I use my two-in-one shampoo conditioner
get that done with pretty quickly do you
ever leave conditioner part that's all
one part now get out of the shower I'll
put in just the kind of shaping wax get
about a finger shape it up shake it
around and stop No what's next
hair dryer I'll put some hairspray in
and then I'm good to go
that's pretty much my maintenance what I
expect for like the end of the week is
that my hair is gonna be super dry so
that I don't know I don't wash my hair
every day for that reason because I
don't want to dry it out for my routine
I will do a hair mask I'll wash my hair
and then I'll condition it with my
purple conditioner you're gonna use my
mane and tail shampoo and then you're
gonna go for the purple conditioner and
then you're gonna go for the 3 minute
miracle I will let that sit in for like
5 minutes while I shave you have to run
jay baer with cold water though before
you get out no you did not you have to
close the hair follicle it's essential
so after I get another shower I will
take my leave in conditioner which I
know I need and then I will take an oil
on top of that and then I just air dry
it and once my hair is dry more oil I'm
gonna need that cut to do this like
every day that's so much it could be a
good day for you smells great my hair
has so many different scents I'm scared
that it's gonna turn out great like I'm
gonna love how my hair feels and I'm
gonna start doing this and then that'll
be a problem because we'll both be
taking 40 minutes like to get our hair
done you're gonna have so much free time
I know I'll do nothing with my hair I'll
just sit there and be like waiting for
you are you ready try this baby alright
let's do it later in the day and I'm
coming to realize that this entire week
is going to be a bun week just feels dry
and terrible and I miss my products
already it has to be a hat day because
there's nothing you can do with this if
I can't use my wax it just
flies everywhere but I smell great it's
not almost not terrible sounds like me
I'm still as fluffiest
and soft as ever I think I'm gonna
experiment with the hair extensions ah
ready for the day they keep getting in
my mouth and my nose and I don't know
how girls do this every day there's a
reason why I use the products that I use
so that I can avoid hair like this it
did learn what it felt like to wear them
a little but I think I'm just gonna keep
going with the hair routine I just
finish with my shower and my blow-dryer
my wax and then here's still a little
bit wet because I don't got to shape it
it's so much and I hate the feeling in
my hair I wish I could use that of mine
so bad definitely not my favorite look
but it's better
I haven't had flowy hair like down near
my eyes and my face since I was like 16
so it was either this or shave my head
and I went with a little mini man fun I
was surprised at how much it affected my
daily life they made it so conditioned
and just so light that it was so
annoying I'm ready for my hair gel and
hairspray back this is not me it is the
final day of my fluffy hair hey you
ready
hairspray time the last one your hairs
sticking up like so bad on the side good
time already today is what I've learned
to love some argan oil that's gonna do
the trick I'm not sad about this ending
I learn
all the things that you have to put into
your hair and you have to maintain like
having the long hair I keep doing over
there I've given up on it I just have
all over my hands
your hair looks so funny hey we're
switching our routines back after we're
done filming this I am sprinting to the
shower back to in lawn shampoos calling
my name</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
