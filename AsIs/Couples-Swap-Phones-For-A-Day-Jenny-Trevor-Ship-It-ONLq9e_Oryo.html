tendency to drop my phone in the toilet
so I'm going to be dropping her phone in
the toilet this you don't have a
passcode on your phone
I am completely open I'm notebook I once
fell asleep on my phone while searching
through Poupon and found out I had
ordered a dildo this isn't actually the
first time I've done this my roommate
and I actually switched phones for a
video we were one week into dating when
this happened and so I was texting her
and was completely being ghosting her
roommate swiped right on one of my best
friends and then Jen was talking to this
guy while talking to me I am so
efficient that last night I had a dude
ready to come over immediately
with Taylor you guys were still trying
to remain friends after that I am going
to destroy you
no I thought of that case I'm gonna
destroy this case whoo all my bros all
right how do we start this
hi my step that already doesn't sound
like you you they said hi Jenny
they literally do when they literally
yeah I'm never gonna make it through
this day I just left the gym it turns
out that my gym doesn't have Wi-Fi but
you don't have to worry about that when
your phone has unlimited data
now do you so apparently when you have
no data you can't really do anything on
a cell phone you just have to like live
like a turtle going from shelter to
shelter trying to make your way in this
way thanks Trevor I don't think I have
anything to hide on my phone but you
just have so much power over everything
that I'm connected to so I've just
changed every contact in Jenny's phone
to a picture of my roommate so I'm
pretty sure she's gonna enjoy that a la
so I just realized that I can
texts my best friend from Trevor's phone
because my birthday is next week and I
think they're talking about what they're
planning for me and I don't want to ruin
that surprise social media is huge and
you get to publicize everything you're
doing so I'm just posted any Donald trum
status on Jennings Facebook so really
here's the kind of reaction that gets
run of friends and hopefully she doesn't
have too many people no delete her from
Facebook by shared a really silly post
on Facebook on Trevor's page and the
only person that commented it was my mom
yeah is that weird my mom my grandma and
my aunt we all have a Facebook message
group and it's all in Hungarian so I
keep trying to talk in this chat but
it's all in Hungarian so as quickly as I
can translate something it just goes on
to the next subject I think they're
talking about food right now but I could
not keep up boys I said your mom oh yeah
you pissed off my mom I'm not I I was
just like my mom thought I forgot what
it meant to be Jewish 3 words with Jenny
she asked what does kosher mean she goes
are you joking and I had to like abort
and then it's just like I just see the
dot dot dot son like Jen what have you
done
I'm just happy to have this back
she changed the location of all the apps
on my iPhone yeah
it's messed oh it's ridiculous how you
had it before I've opened weather eight
time trying to get to Google Maps there
texting your friends I know that you
hang out all the time with me and you
don't hang out with your boys anymore
and I wanted to stop calling them my
boys you and your boys are just a group
of little assholes
I don't know how she does it with this
no data thing I know what I'm getting
her for her birthday and it's data cuz
this is nonsense
I would love that actually</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
