is an honest answer we're gonna pack
right you know I think the biggest
problem in our relationship is that Dan
is a really big liar I have a lot of
serious questions and I want some
serious answers um I'm just gonna tell
the truth I'm gonna be 100% honest I'm
gonna tell the truth unless it makes me
look bad
I'm not gonna lie but I think I find
hard to lie I were pastor so there's the
potential that you would like I'm not
going to lie
you think that it's my responsibility to
cook dinner for us and wash the dishes
yes that is the truth do you think that
you're funnier than me
yes that is showing truthful that's
interesting based on our careers do you
trust me
yes that's right assuring us the truth
do you think I have bad taste and
clothes hmm hold on no I wouldn't be
able to use everything it's hard to say
it's not bad it's just not the best have
you ever had a sex dream about one of
your friends and did you bother
no I'm games ID on that one that would
register as a as a lie have you ever
wanted to break up
no this being faithful thank God
everyone is relieved
when I was out of town did you clean the
litter box every day like you said you
did no that's a truthful answer I knew
where do you think that you're a better
person than me yes that is true
will we ever move in together no that is
not an honest answer
okay do you trust me no if I were to go
by the Machine no is being is the honest
answer yes hmm interesting
will you go to Pittsburgh with will ever
to visit my family yes that is also a
lie do you think that we'll still be
dating in six months time I hope so I
couldn't use any of okay in a court of
law
do you think they will be dating in ask
if I want to be dating in six months
yeah but that's okay fine
would you like to still be dating in six
months yes truth that's what matters
even though I wasn't happy with all of
the veldt honest answers I guess it's
better to have a horrible honest answer
than a horrible lie I feel closer
because I didn't think you would care to
ask the questions he asked some things
you don't need to like know necessarily
like I do really need to know if like I
want to go with you to Pittsburgh I'll
just go and I'll act like I want to go
it's not just gonna fine like acting
every once in a while and those have to
live the relationships though they think
that to rocket I hope that now we're
closer to being totally trusting of one
another
which would be great</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
