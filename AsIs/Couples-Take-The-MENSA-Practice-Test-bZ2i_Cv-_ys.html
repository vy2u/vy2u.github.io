she's very competitive I can see it
building in her sometimes it was the
smallest little thing that I realized as
a competition I've been getting down for
13 years and I know he's gonna do better
than me because he was an astrophysicist
she's grossly underselling yourself I
actually think she'll do pretty well
I think she will actually end up having
probably the same or higher IQ score
than me even though she claims otherwise
if Mandy scores better than me on this
test maybe she'll give me a break but
our families will just I'll never hear
the end of it when I think about it the
more I realize I would probably have I
know a much higher IKEA area you will
and you're older - okay
this is a test of mental maturity and
taking it you will show how well you
understand certain types of
relationships and what you do when you
face new problems I'm going to be good
at that divided by 25 oh you got that
it's a really weird shape foot I don't
know which one doesn't belong which one
would not belong there oh my god I have
no idea
second pictures related to the first we
have Direction signs and then the state
of California and we have a clock which
would relate to something a larger there
is the state of Texas the Sun a sign or
a compass hmm well the direction signs
will help you get around the state of
California and time would help us
determine our place around the Sun high
school student borrowed $75 for one year
at 6% to start a chicken ranch how many
little chickens must he sell at 10 cents
each to pay back the money he borrowed
with interest which is 75 6% 10 cents
I have like no time I think it's 450 and
that's an option have this feeling like
I'm getting a hundred percent of these
wrong you owe me just a run first yeah
what'd you get five minutes the score
was 32 that's why most forty hey I told
you I was here do you having to get
better than me
alright go ahead I got a 44 oh it smells
good what did you get I got a 50 really
you only got 6 points higher than me I'm
smart I feel like I was going super slow
I know it I thought that it might take
you longer to like oh that's arenas
because you're like you take information
you're like process process pathos and
I'm like faster yeah which is a sign of
genius but first I was a little
disappointed sighs like Oh 44 man I'm
dumb then now knowing Daniels score here
boom wait more than I thought I was your
score was higher I would not have been
surprised I kind of mentally prepared
myself for that so because it was less
I'm really excited
oh good yeah I just like her to be happy
Andy here's like the trash talk um now
she's got more fuel for her fire
I wish I'd gotten like 10 point tyre
that would have separated us about here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
