real doctor said that you should really
take this test for happiness
this this was a test in the 1930s
developed by this guy dr. George W crane
made a blueprint for happiness for
husbands and wives Wow
the perfect husband a wife test we're
gonna ask each other these questions and
judging on the questions you get two
merits or merits we'll figure out if I'm
going to marry this woman or not
probably Oh
here's to open so many thoughts on this
but I'm gonna save them till after we
take it okay so it appears like I'm
open-minded woman never goes to bed
angry always makes up first is that
honestly a question woman never goes to
bed angry always makes up first no this
is what I feared for this test this is
the beginning it's not gonna get better
for you
matt is polite and mannerly even alone
with whoa
thank God here polite to me when we're
alone how sweet of you the bar is so not
sit on me once the door closes ha ha ha
woman wears ragged dresses and aprons
around the house oh yeah I like crap
around the house he's not like dress no
no she's not she's dressing the threes
or fours yeah I'm cooking what do you
want me to do like doll up for my
kitchen man fails to bathe or change
socks and you think your shower pretty
regularly actually I wash my socks I do
by the learning regulation I do you are
a civilized woman
woman serves too much from tin cans or
the delicatessen store that's all I
served from yeah when you cook me dinner
it's in the microwave I just I love it
it's delicious
this is ridiculous okay - one man fails
to come to the table on time Ashley is
never late for dinner because he likes
me
just show up it's like be a level-five
of human decency to women and you're in
you're a winner women is willing to get
a job to help support homes all of these
things are not conducive to you having a
job I'd be single as any man is true to
his wife yeah well that's a plus ten why
don't I have any plus 5s or tens you're
a woman only five minor children only
children are plus five woman has minor
children to care for five points per
child or no she does not
I'm something to tell you didn't I get
it just blah Plunkett man is an ardent
lover C's white has orgasm in marital
Congress here's a funny thing though is
that it's back plus 20 so theoretically
you could - ten for man not being true
to wife but you could make up for it
with an or dose if you get her off every
now and then so you can also plus 20 for
that yes if anyone knows a way for me to
get back to the 1930s let me know I tell
you at the official score yep tallied up
it Charlie in the 1930s she was sucked I
would have rocked your socks learned
that lady they might not have cut it
back in the thirties let's be fair
though the ways that you cut it well
ridiculous how this is even if
this was nineteen thirties I'm like well
you'll fit any of these but whatever I'm
about let's get married now like you
being sassy and having your miss
independent that she's really funny
