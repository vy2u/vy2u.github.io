sure our most lipsticks supposed to do
that we're getting ready to try out
different lipsticks to see how kiss
proof they are
I like Tori lipstick um because I think
it's a really like obvious embodiment of
my feminist I like to wear lipstick but
I tend to wear it mostly on days when I
know I'm not gonna see him I have been
married for two years with my husband
for four he's not here he has work but
probably good because I get to make out
with photos of James Corden when I wear
lipstick it's not if it comes off on the
husband if it comes off on the wine
glass I do wear lip products I hate I
hate when she wears lip stuff I mean I
feel like the more high-end one is gonna
work better I don't think any of them
are gonna be great I think the more
expensive ones will have you believe
like oh you don't feel as much the
little oh blah it's all marketing lives
you might think spending some extra
money on lipstick will make it better
but I found that some expensive
lipsticks it doesn't matter let's start
kissing like in our pretty this is I
love urban decay they know how to really
package a product you want to know what
this color name is called
yes it's called bang let's bang let's go
I like to color on you all right I'm not
sure my dresses go like that what is
this NYX liquid suede with suede my
stomach hurts just saying liquid suede
feels a little clumpy it's hard to apply
yep that's just on there you look like
you're wearing lipstick really I don't
first of all too faced melted Matt it's
Matt which probably means it's like less
transferable than like something that's
super moist
okay feels thick and heavy Turkey soon
honestly I still think so see fake
friends from the earlier lipstick
there's like a little but I can you put
like your own bomb over it afterwards it
probably wouldn't transfers easily this
is Revlon Colorstay
over time I'm honestly a little stressed
about this cuz it says it's gonna stay
on for 16 hours 16 hours of comfortable
color no touch-ups needed even after
meals have they had chicken fingers out
of Dave &amp;amp; Buster's
just a few specks there but it's pretty
much they dot I mean there's a little
residue I'm this does not want to come
off you can use like nail polish remover
like right here right next we're gonna
try this maybelline superstay 24 Kahlua
oh that's so cute take a little chatter
pretty good that's good yeah cool
just layer some Mac over this and see
what happens
looks like he's now vomited blood paint
came off alive it was just a peck to all
at all I was pleasantly surprised as I
think the ones I thought that we're
gonna be insane and awesome work gonna
be I think that you pay for what you get
and sometimes spending a little more get
you a little more the lower end brands
that I've tried in the past that have
some longevity and staying power feel
gross on my lips whereas these I think I
think the key is the lip balm the
included lip balm I'm a little surprised
just cuz if you're spending that much
more money you'd hope they would stay as
long oh yeah there we go
remember when you like taught yourself
to kiss by using your hand if you said
you didn't do it you're a liar I know
you did cuz everyone did it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
