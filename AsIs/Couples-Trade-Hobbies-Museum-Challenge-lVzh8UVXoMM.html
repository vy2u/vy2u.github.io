it people work that's why because I
remember you can bring Patrick up here I
did my research before I came here yes I
remember this the one thing about this
is that the base materials still paper
it's sort of like a two dimensional
plane but it's also a sculpture because
you can walk through it you can walk
around that you can experience when I go
home I'm gonna get paper staples hole
punchers I'm gonna make something of my
own you have my stuff over here if I
make something well we can do a studio

beautiful let me tell you why the artist
his name is Lorenzo I don't remember his
last name but if you look closely look
at the cuts and look at how it's been
painted over it now with the cool thing
about this is that it's like a 360 but
if you go from the inside you can this
is the only time you can relook at an
artwork you go all the way around
oh don't touch when you're gonna music

know that I was yelled at earlier I
think just the details in here but is
just remarkable now we're gonna go by
Frank with the P don't read any I'm

fascinating about Frank is that she just
is just great at what she does we have
shoes life vests and shorts what's the
only living comment yes Frank uses you
could actually use it no way yeah that's
the special thing about it I don't want
to be a tour guy and I have so much
respect for it this is not my cup of tea
but I'm learning something usually I
have to read all the little things on
the wall so they know it's
and he's like pulling me away because
he's so bored he wants to leave but I
can't believe actually how much
information he knows about these people
I hope it's all true Patrick fellows
