really good yeah everyone should do that
before
to babe's reeling in the ocean but have
you been in the ocean that's no place
for kisses I can do the moves like the
spider-man moves it is one of my
favorite love stories of all time I have
read the book and I have watched the
movie several times alone we are about
to watch the lady in the Tramp spaghetti
kiss scene infamous kiss scene everybody
knows it he definitely has like a
predator run I just love chasing people
I think it's so exciting like mid kiss I
have to chase okay you can kitty I have
like a lot of blood in his head he does
look at the veins on his neck and
reenacting Gosling's every move i think
is the next step in being a great
boyfriend we both look surprisingly like
these dogs honestly like that's a pretty
hot cocker spaniel so I'm not like good
self-esteem
I've never
wasn't over it still isn't over
so we just did it doggystyle on camera
true love man great in true love just
great I gotta say great great spaghetti
really good for you really good
spaghetti no true love right I don't
know if it's true I did all the kissing
it was really really satisfying that
probably was the best kiss you've ever
it could be agree the water made it more
realistic the water adds to the drama of
everything the thing is is the tongue
positions are really awkward so it's
like oh yeah you know can you see our
tongues I love kissing on camera turns
out what's this any case you see on on
TV just go do it
you probably do it better cartoon women
look really sexy even when they're
animal let's not talk about your anime
thing right now okay that's a spicy
meat-a-ball</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
