been furnished by a good poet chair

a very important advantage ooh

healthy snack you gave me too much you
got a chocolate granola bar so it's not
been healthy okay

world how many times would your partner
have sex a week hope my mom does not

seven times a week one per day oh that's
correct

pleasure one I could go with minute
challenge it's a Korean reality show
Rondo dogs great job for points I'm
gonna go with one of the ones that we
haven't watched in a little while but we
always have good like intellectual
conversations during and after and I
feel like it's just a solid choice I'm
just gonna go with it
my stuff over advice I love life wait
Bojack oh my god
Bojack final score of four to three you
guys get a very special advantage this
week we're going to do the no
instructions challenge one person gets
to use the directions but can't touch
anything and the other person gets to
build it but can't look at the
directions whoever finishes the chair
first will win
title of goals oh man gonna be but
everything Claire you get to decide who
reads the directions and who assembles
the chair for both people oh great you
read and then all you sure yeah now
Claire you're not gonna be able to read
the instructions Adam I've done chairs
before so I'm pretty confident okay done
who's doing what out of Jan and Steven
oh you know them well
I feel like Stevens he should be able to
build a chair without even struck ya
know what I mean yeah that's what I
think yeah yeah I think Steve Monsieur
Reed and Jan should be same you think
he's a little more handy I would love to
see that one see blue did they make the
right choice or are they are they
screwed here's a Rama to say though I
mean what if this is your true calling
I'm probably is are you ready I'm ready
let's do this bang bang Pohang three two
one go
what okay well here is it alright but I
don't think you're even supposed to
touch it that's your right we got this
we got this okay Evan Claire how you
guys doing good
I mean we just open it up oh hey Claire
use the curvy one with two - yeah down
one that will open it up okay and then
you see the one with the poor poor leg
to the four four legs so the only thing
that's in front of that get those
instructions there you go all right step
one
four days are gonna go into one wait for
what
put those now okay hey this has to be
this that way that way yes that way the
second one is one with the black stripe
that one yes that one yeah
why I don't know just go ahead I can put
the longer piece that matches that yeah
nice
how can one has velcro and the others
don't well cross that bridge when we get
you'll Apollo one use a colon
no one's a little slightly skinnier Jen
Steven how you guys doing we're okay we
struggle to get this package open we
should take a short cut here and just
screw in a few so that it stays together
okay you're having to be sitting in it
for too long yeah cause it'll be broken
on the floor so I think you're gonna
slide it into that black bag oh I push
my stuff talk to me it's not going it
won't catch I say we keep building it
it's really know if it's different stuff
this is really kind of a an exercise and
just like cut and patience you know
Purdue and we're ten minutes in how we
do it we're halfway there
you're barred no real over there cause
the other other team doing I can't tell
you that we're past halfway there
well yeah turn that side today I just
like it up but there's no holes here and
there are holes here all right cool
you're right so flip the burger hi it's
ray hard turn it turn it turn it
no turn left turn left spin it spin it
no no no we got the velcro on on the
wrong leg but does it matter I think so
I'm pretty sure man get we have two more
steps left just two more steps
cool good enough go can I just like drag
it there no don't drink a little fall
apart it's not falling apart right no I
thought we're gonna slide it here okay
oh my god
it was very very close the fastest
couple to assemble the chair a chair
that they were successfully able to sit
in
which Jen and Steven congratulations you
guys are goals and you are going to a
fancy sushi dinner okay we tried our
best I tried my best for sure there's no
regrets I mean we ate the questions
right that's all yeah that's what's most
important to us
shucks later it feels great I feel happy
I feel great I think we have a lot in
common I think that's why we've stuck
together for a while that's all I care
about
we have loser mentality we do and I
think that's probably what made us men
everyone looks up to you my wife and I
look up to you whoa thanks for watching
