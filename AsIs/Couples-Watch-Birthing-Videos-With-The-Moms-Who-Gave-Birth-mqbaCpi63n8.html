month very clearly said that we're not
gonna have children we are nowhere near
the time of wanting kids but we both
really like the idea of one day having
kids yeah we've been together for almost
three years now you ready to have a baby
and all that good stuff baby time I
think it's an amazing thing I think it's
a beautiful thing yeah I say that having
not seen it the weirdest thing is to
think like if the baby has a penis that
you're growing up kinas inside of you at
first
I definitely think at first you're
nervous and now now we're excited you're
bringing life in below this magical
almost I think watching it will finally
get me mentally ready because you know
I've been imagining it but I don't know
how it's actually gonna look you know
like spread open like maybe feel like
I'm gonna be disgusted and horrified I'm
high you know you're gonna be all right
I couldn't do a home birth yeah oh my
god yeah a natural home birth in water
in a tub and no drugs or you know of
course not so you guys are gonna see the
first entire c-section my first one
where I was pushing after several hours
and he was stuck you're in a hospital
right I'm in a hospital
yeah do you have any drugs in me right
now no none oh we're just going for I
just went for it so let's see my vagina
okay that's a nice tub you're cold
because half your intestines are on the
table this is so crazy
at this point you seem miserable that's
his head so I knew he was coming so this
is like the relief this is the relief
you seem extra flexible to it I am yeah
yeah like his head is a really weird
shape
yeah that's see look whoa did you see my
I think that was a little bit of my : oh
my god vaginas oh my god wait oh my god
look at this look at how far it goes it
goes from like there to there Wow Wow
yeah I drunk great yeah I know
you get emotional - you're sweaty
oh wow that happened so fast that like
what's the head with that while that
happened so fast the coloring is not
like it doesn't look healthy to me
there she is did you just came out
that's poop Hannah's first poop oh I
know I'm gonna cry right now
that's like the moment I became a mom
that sound always see that changes every
day the Gerry base I'm not saying like
the battle wounds yeah that changes
everything after seeing this video I
just want to say to my mom oh my gosh
thank you so much and give her a hug for
like 20 minutes until she probably says
follow me when the baby was out I felt
relieved it was really beautiful you say
it's worth it and beautiful and amazing
and I think that's really cool and I
don't want to do that so I feel like I
think we can say that after seeing this
we still think it's beautiful but it's
beautiful mixed with gross it's so
empowering first of all and and I just
can't you just did it girl and I just
that's what I want to do well that's
about you just have pasta sauce and
there's no other option I'm gonna go
make another one that's cool do it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
