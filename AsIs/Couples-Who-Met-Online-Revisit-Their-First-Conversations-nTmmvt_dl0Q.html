it's like Oh freaky cinderella story and
it's never I never believed in that
 his username was
pensive humor
when we first started talking I didn't
have any romantic interest in Matt I
actually was just really thanks I didn't
Pat's profile was like it was very
creative he put he like listed himself
almost like an apartment I think your
your profile in the way that you
represented yourself I was surprised how
easygoing and laid-back you were guy
looks and sounds normal and then all of
a sudden you go to the end he's like a
creep on this little asian girl I almost
didn't go out a date with you I don't
know I just I thought it looked good in
the photo I really didn't see the nipple
until after post you look like you're
cold
uh we were about to start college
together the profile picture drew me and
immediately I think you were in Central
Park you it was like your senior picture
you looked really cute but I wish I
think you're like doing that like a
clean look all this is kind of cute I
was like it's easier dressed if you
texted me so I gave me my number and me
she was such an easy an easy tip oh hey
it's Mallory looking forward to Monday
okay okay sweet yeah I can't wait I'll
be putting my thinking cap on for a good
place let me know if you come across
something interesting - have a good day
exclamation you were such a nice hey
there it's totally gonna crack some joke
about catching grapes in my mouth but
then I thought hold on that seems way
too sexual for the first message and
then instead of writing you a witty
opening line I decided who's better idea
to compose my inner monologue to you and
now we both know why I'm on the stamp
site responded haha hi perfect first
message by the way a bit weird but way
better than a lot of the fair that you
get so this is like the day of the date
I said I just got here but I'm listening
to cereal in the car hahaha what is that
I'm in my car listening to Chitty Bang
and I said I have that's what I met the
for the real man okay hi Allison I saw
your income way to go with print
journalism I'm really interested in that
- wow that's on sore kick what other
interests slash hobbies do you have
what is your summer consisted of hillock
interviewing me hey Matt I love watching
movies going for early-morning bike
rides going the beach playing with my
dog Russell Crowe of course the way I
phrase things sounds really funny it's
like I'm trying really hard to be
impressive
it's weird I wasn't weirded out by all
the information he knew about me the
third hang out I texted
hey any plans all right we're about to
do a hike in the OSI tinder date I could
grab you I had high hopes for online
dating is a way to kind of cut through
the clutter then I found you so yeah
looking back on it I had so many tinder
failures and I think the moment I met
Mallory I was like wow this could be
finally someone I can see see something
with we really did connect quickly and
establish a really good friendship and
to see the way that that's evolved in
the 10 years since those messages took
place and that friendship has formed
something that's become I think the
greatest relationship either of us is
ever gonna end up having so that's
really special I'm glad he stalked me on
Facebook to join tinder yeah Ella bring
you lots of joy and maybe a lot of sex
to lots of good surprise attack but I
did good I just continued Alyssa</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
