such a muppet I thought he was super
boring I thought he was cute I hate that
word okay but that's what I thought I
thought you were cute we actually met
out in Vegas I was with somebody and he
was with somebody else a friend she was
on a date okay I was on the base I
wasn't I wasn't interested at all first
didn't want to date me when I worked
with I didn't want to date any more
performers I wore her down and did you
like each other that first night we
didn't really actually interact my
didn't whole time we're not like oh yeah
I'm Jewish
it's Christian I am very much an
introvert you definite extrovert I'm
super sporty adventurous love to be
outside country girl I love big cities I
teach fitness classes and I can't get my
way for him to come and take my frickin
class I never ever could really date
anybody who smokes I'm not a smoker I'm
quitting smoking you quit she's an
Android user I'm a high phone user that
bugs the crap out of me we think you
quit I'm cool I quit and I smoke maybe
one a day he thinks baking is a food
group bacon is it is nothing so is the
grease everything that I want her to do
she does the exact opposite trying to go
somewhere we're in a rush stop talking
to like the mailman Carl has an
interesting story
yeah so I'm super low-maintenance like
roll out of bed that she's lying right
now she I am super low meaning no no no
this this doesn't just happen so I like
suspense movies and he likes all this
Midwest mid mid not evil mid evil Star
Wars you know it storms no I wasn't sure
if I wanted to have children and I want
a huge family like only it's five I was
raised crazy superstitious no hats on
the bed that would hat on a bed you're
gonna get you is bad luck so what do you
two have in common
hmm I think we appreciate our difference
with maybe not the food thing we both
think we're super creative well I I
actually probably think I'm more
creative than you but she's uh I'm the
designer uh we love each other first
because we love each other very much
I always like to say that she really is
the yin to my yang yeah we totally
balance each other out
as I am so scattered all over the place
you tend to ground me it's also perfect
because it opens both of us up to trying
to find new experiences of things that
neither of us have done I honestly think
that being different is bad exactly we
take our differences in our similarities
and we kind of find something new I've
gone camping twice I danced to Beyonce
it's always interesting to talk to a
person that is so different than you and
it will balance you I think it's well
it's great I think it's great honestly I
love her and that overshadows anything
else love conquers all right together in
love I wonder and we have each other and
we love it jamming this is a person that
I probably would have butted heads with
when I was a child
now we could not have met at eleven no
you probably couldn't have met at 24
what surprised she's so using the word
cute after all this kind okay I thought
you are sexy yes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
