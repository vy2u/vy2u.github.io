I might learn something that like
unleashes a curly power I didn't have I
think that you're just gonna be really
disappointed in me so I only shampoo
once a week so every time I take a
shower I'm getting my hair wet basically
conditioner I usually will rinse it out
pretty much till it's almost completely
gone and you just like put your head
under the shower faucet right yeah okay
what do you do like take it off and no
I'll have to explain I flip my head
upside down over the tub and then I
scrunch scrunch scrunch getting like all
the layers underneath couple more pumps
and just kind of do the top layers I
don't like towel it dry and I just kind
of like walk around the morning until it
stops being so wet are you ready yeah so
I have two pieces of paper here what
okay so everything is done upside down
everything as far as conditioner goes
you get a shit-ton a conditioner from
the test is still upside down you're
still upside down cup water in your hand
why me with lots of gel later in the day
you're gonna do what's called breaking
the gel so what you do I'm standing up
for this you have to be gentle otherwise
you're gonna create frizz so you're just
like get you wiggle your fingers in
there and we're like wiggling up toward
the scalp I just want to not look crazy
now it doesn't look wet all of a sudden
and it grew three times the size good
use diffuser on medium heat I don't like
no dry I will get you one okay on days
when I'm not washing i water it like a
plant I also sleep with a silk
pillowcase it sounds like a lot but it's
not I think your hair is gonna look
worse I passed this to you so this is
the morning when I would normally shower
but not get my hair wet I would just
spray it with my bottle because I'm
getting in the shower I guess that means
I have to get my whole freakin head way
I'm just woken up and
do a bunch of stuff to my hair Megan has
a lot of steps so I have two pieces of
paper here washing my hair and not
upside down was one thing and now
gelling my hair I don't know how this is
gonna turn out it smells delicious
though alright so I just finished
Megan's routine and I gotta say I did
not care for it your head has to be
upside down for so long I haven't let my
hair dry like this in years I'm just
full of drips I feel like the gel just
did not reach the top of my hair Megan
it feels like 70 degrees outside which
is not that cold but it's cold enough
that I don't want to walk around with
really wet hair when it's 70 degrees out
here it is all dry and as you can tell
there's definitely like it's kind of
undefined and then more defined towards
the bottom which is what I thought was
gonna happen
I definitely though like the way the
defined curls are looking they're
looking pretty good it's very soft so
it's the end of the day and my hair is
frizzy err than normal it's a good thing
that I have Meghan's trusty silk
pillowcase cotton out of here lovely
silk pillowcase I slept on the silk
pillowcase last night I gotta say my
hair isn't as poofy as I'm normally what
is so my hair I guess just like has to
look like a mess today because Sarah
doesn't do anything good that helps her
hair on the days that she doesn't get it
wet Megan told me on days that she
where she uses a spray bottle that's mix
of conditioner and water to kind of give
it a little judge
it smells good so here's the problem
when I conditioned my hair like Sarah in
the shower I didn't get the top or the
front and so the curls have no idea what
they're doing like they're confused
that's confused I'm confused
I didn't shampoo it at ages did the
conditioner in the gel it's definitely
looking a little bit better however this
takes me about twice as long in the
shower I am going to put into effect
something that Sarah prescribed for
frizz the frizz be gone
you'll see if this makes a difference
and it also gets just like tons of stuff
in my eyes cuz I'm upside down the whole
time well now that that fixed all of my
problems just kidding I'm putting on a
headband I don't have a blow-dry I will
get you one
I don't think my curls have ever stayed
looking so defined the curls are looking
pretty good pretty well-defined I just
need to get that volume back on top well
it's the afternoon now and I have
followed Megan's hair procedure today
which means it's time to fluff it up I'm
crunching and fluffing I think that if I
merged my upside down Miss with her
keeping the water in we might have a
match made in heaven I think I just need
to lessen the amount of gel that I'm
putting in my hair cuz it feels so
greasy and gross but I have to say I did
get a lot of compliments on my curls
today a lot of people said they were
looking very defined very bouncy how do
you only shampoo once a week when there
is so much stuff in your hair I feel so
like dirty
to put enough gel in my hair to get to
the point that it's crunchy that's a lot
of prime
I never said make it crunchy yeah you
know you don't see use Marshall I think
it's fine I'll use that okay you're
buying it
people have said my hair looks the same
your hair looks very different yeah you
know what I do really like the vid
diffuser because it like lets me not be
your curls do look really good right you
just need some volume we're learning
things really good we're experiencing it
was fun that for a week seeing the way
that another curly person does their
hair just we kind of just confirmed that
I know my hair and I know what I'm doing
with it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
