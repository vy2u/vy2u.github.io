is this your boobs grow the littlest bit
and all of a sudden it's impossible to
find a flattering fitted blouse that
doesn't gap have the designers of
blouses never met a busty woman before
forget this why did I even think I could
borrow this from my sister everything on
me has cleavage I am like pouring out of
this maybe a scarf I got it's like 90
degrees in this oh yeah here we go
covers me up but it's still flattering
yeah and then there's my butt it's gonna
be hard to downplay my butt is my butt
not professional will people take
offense to my butt if I didn't have a
good butt and would it be professional
Oh next well maybe I should just say
screw it and go all out
maybe my interviewer will be all
progressive and respects my boldness ya
know why do I even own this okay there's
no gap the pattern on my skirt isn't too
much I feel comfortable in this I can
look good and be professional right I am
professional my boobs are professional
my butt is professional and it looks
good I'm smart and I look great and I'm
gonna get the job because I deserve it
and I'm qualified yes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
