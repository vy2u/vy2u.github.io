it in 2012 a kayaker in Chicago was
knocked out of his boat by a Swan the
Swan then blocked him from swimming to
safety
he drowned to death look at that hippo
it's so funny in sub-saharan Africa
hippos kill more people per year than
any other mammal either by stomping
humans into the ground or mauling them
with their milk bottle sized teeth look
at him eat anta in 2007 an anteater
lashed its claws at a young sue keeper
in Buenos Aires it was completely
unprovoked and tragically took the
zookeepers lives I so cute I want one
the slow loris is one of the only
poisonous mammals in the world a bite
from them can cause death by
anaphylactic shock if only I knew what
anaphylactic man I want to ride the
elephant these gentle giants are
incredibly smart they also sometimes go
absolutely nuts stampeding through
villages and trampling humans it's funny
cuz they act like people these vicious
predators have been known to literally
pull people's faces apart in 2002 an
adult male in Tanzania actually stole
and ate a human baby
in conclusion animals can't still be
deadly even if they are adorable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
