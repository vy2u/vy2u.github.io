was a natural today we're gonna be
testing lip scrubs
you've probably seen the store bought
version this one is from lush it's just
a little exfoliant it's really great for
getting away dry skin so that your
lipstick goes on really smooth and nice
I really like the lush lip scrub I'm not
gonna lie but I figure there's
definitely a way to DIY this so I'm
going to try DIY in it and then I'm
going to give the lip scrub to a few of
my friends and we're gonna tick which
one is the best lip scrub there's really
three categories that we're ranking us
on that is price which one's cheaper
product which one worked better and
practicality is this really annoying to
make is it practical to make what I
actually okay let's make some lip scrub
all right so I've got printed out
instructions that's how you know I mean
business
first thing we're gonna do in a
medium-sized bowl mix brown sugar and
coconut oil until fully combined okay we
can do that
then you also need one tablespoon of
honey
tastes as good as it smells
we're in pertree it's kind of hard to
mix though like it gets stuck to the
spoon a lot I think the best way to mix
it is to sort of like smear it on the
edges and then like put it back in the
spoon and then smear it again stir in a
one drop of peppermint oil
Wow that was really easy I definitely
thought that was gonna take way longer
and way more ingredients but it did not
so now I'm gonna scoop it into some
little jars and give it to my friends
alright so I just finished making the
lip scrubs I put them in these very
secretive containers this is the store
bought version this is the DIY version
and now I'm gonna go hand them to a few
of my friends so that they can take them
home and try them out and let me know
which one they think is best
okay guys I'm gonna try this lip scrub
these tulips okay so I'm gonna try these
two lip scrubs that Ashley gave me just
wash my face put a little moisturizer on
and now I'm going to try this first lip
scrub one is homemade the other is
store-bought I don't know which is which
and we're gonna see which one I like the
best okay so I'm gonna start off with a
lip scrub hey this kind of just seems
like brown sugar and it'll be really bad
if it's just a rupture cuz I think it is
so it's kind of granule ysou it feels
like the grains are gonna fall a little
bit on your face and clothes so I guess
maybe there's you know a super clean lip
scrub I don't like the way that one
feels sweet to speak okay I'm trying out
lip scrub sample B let's scrim feet this
is more oily I have no idea what this
smells like but it smells good
feels like there's some hint of mint
maybe a minty and sticky so that's how
he is feeling this one's like let's just
dealing with loss this is like plenty I
don't know man I think I maybe like to
sample a slightly better because it was
a little less messy and it tasted better
but they're both pretty similar and they
both worked equally well they say that I
liked a better more like granular sugar
arena d1o and tasted better and also
thought it was doing one on my wife
yeah Merrigan people really loved that
lush lip scrub I'm happy that the DIY
lip scrub wasn't a total fail I think
you can definitely do this especially if
you're in a pinch and you're just about
to go out and have to put lipstick on
but your lips are all chapped and you
don't have lip scrub on hand you can
just go and make this in your kitchen
really quick which is super convenient
and awesome but ultimately despite all
my DIY efforts people still preferred
the lush lip scrub this is not sponsored
in any way lush has no idea that I'm
doing this but even without knowing
people really enjoys the lip scrub if
there's a product that you want to see
me test the DIY version definitely let
me know in the comments also if you have
a better DIY lip scrub recipe for sure
let me know in the comments because I'd
love to know what you guys are making
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
