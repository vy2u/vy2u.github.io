oh my god it's Tuesday what does that
mean there must be something on that I'm
forgetting hey you know what today
I'm just going to do me and go couch but
I might run into an ex at the train
station and they might think I've lost
the plot oh my god what if they think
I'm unhappy am i unhappy how often
should I be happy anyway like what's
happiness state of mind in a motion and
fix this session is anyone truly happy
dogs dogs are happy
did I turn the oven off
oh my home baked but did I hi man I
forgot my keys I'll wait there are my
hands did I turn the oven off though
pick up my keys wallet phone call set I
just say bye to my cat because she might
run away while I'm at work and I'll
never see her again
I wish someone would call me right now
like a bomber I wonder if you ever will
honestly you just never know anything in
life anymore this tranquil Darrell and I
could die or I could save someone's life
or I could meet a new friend or a racist
 I'm not in the mood for any races
today look at everyone staring at their
phones but honestly Instagram is salt
with addictive like everyone looks so
happy online I need to smile more smile
and smile not too much that's so weird
imagine I just fell over right now like
straight on my face and broke all my
teeth would anyone help me probs not I'd
help them assholes I mean they're not as
mean as they could be I guess there are
so many bigger problems in the world and
Here I am focusing on myself when did I
become so first Oh
14 minutes ago why do I never manage to
get to work early why do I never bring a
lunch to work honestly who do I think I
am some kind of millionaire that can
afford lunch every day sugar mama
how cool would it be so we've just open
right now and we're always slipped and
fell into my arms that would be the
sickest status update man be weird too I
mean we get along but not as much as I'd
get along with Lizzy Caplan and I'm
stopped did I breakfast
