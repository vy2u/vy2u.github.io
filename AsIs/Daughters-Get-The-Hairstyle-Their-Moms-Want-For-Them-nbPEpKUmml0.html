crappy seen these silly fish today I'm
gonna be sailing three girls hair but
their mothers are gonna be the ones to
choose their hairstyles the girls are
gonna have no idea what they look like
until the very very end and I cannot
wait to see their reactions this is the
one time I actually have to have her
hair doing exactly like I want it
without any question about know maybe we
should not do it I think this is it
I'm not your well exactly I come in here
once a year once a year and my mom hates
it I think the lights are like that no I
did she still loves me though yeah of
course you should have seen what I
looked like when I was five you should
see when she dressed me in what she did
to my hair I look like Snooki half the
time it was adorable a tease I'm
actually gonna have you jump out so I
can talk to your mom about your hairy
I trust you mom okay okay so tell me
about what you want to see happen with
your daughter's here today I want high
fashion okay but cool and funky edgy
alright but high fashion it's the hair
that Katie Holmes had like in 2008 okay
the sleek bobbed hair okay okay I think
it would look good I think it's a look
that it's a lot like your hair yes Sordo
okay we're gonna be twins I was thinking
maybe okay more of a side part did you
try that maybe a little like Hollywood
glamour 40s okay I like it I like it
all right gonna lead you out
are you excited oh I can't wait yeah it
goes like a trust game you know let you
feel where the chair is it's right here
and you're gonna turn a face to me
three oh my god I love it oh my god I
love it you know kind of long yeah like
a horse like a huge main or some like
avatar character I don't feel like so
out of the ordinary
yeah that's exactly what I bought it
really all right
you did a good job so are you ready to
see all right here you go
oh my god oh my gosh
see this eyes like like I Love Lucy
character like this weird I just want to
have like this big polka dot dress line
cook in the kitchen or something oh my
god
if Jessica Rabbit grabbed it and had
like a really like wannabe little sister
who was blond and wanted really badly to
look like her that's what I look like oh
not my intent or like like Miss Universe
but like back in the 70s it is sure did
a good job you should think about you
were gonna do like super long like me
like a wig or something like he had
you're my age I wanted edgy and
different and these I'm surprised I'm
surprised I would absolutely never ever
let her touch my hair ever ever again I
should have learned when I was seven
maybe I should just go back to the
drawing board that's why I let my
daughter make her own decision okay
that's what I was maybe four I love you
I really had no idea what to expect
today and we did get some mixed
reactions from the girls but I think
what was really great was getting to see
all the moms visions come to life</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
