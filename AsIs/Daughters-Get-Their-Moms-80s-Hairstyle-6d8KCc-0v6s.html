popular in my household did not
discriminate between male or female
because my so every six months I had his
perm and was really big I can tell from
this picture I just had a perm you know
was a perm and a lot of Aqua Net and a
lot of teasing and it was mousse blow
dryer and hair spray I was very into
Madonna in case you can't tell I'm
excited to see how I look on me though
like I don't know I think I could pull
it off meet you yeah I'm a little
nervous to get this hairstyle because
I'm a little scared I look like Captain
Hook I'm excited I think it'd be cool to
do it like that never done my hair
anything that way before he you will
rock the 80s yeah
I feel a lot of mousse and it feels
heavy like on one side
it feels like a lot of stuff on my head
this is weird definitely doesn't feel
like my normal hair anymore
okay well oh my god artisan marble exits
with you I love it
haha I think you should do more often
pepper is messy when you go to a
nightclub I feel like I'm hanging out in
high school again with my bestie there's
no words to describe it this is kind of
what I look like when I wake up in the
morning I feel like if I had this hair
I'd be very conscious of my hair like
the wind rain it's not as bad as I
thought it was going to be like it's
actually kind of okay imma stick to like
curling and straightening my hair yeah I
lie yeah oh so okay thank you - oh good
that makes two of us looking at you it's
looks like a flashback to the eighties
really is not that bad
