arm I was twenty year old exactly like
her actually say we belong to two
different communities so there was a lot
of opposition last minute when I was in
that attire like I did feel like runaway
bride you were awakened into being a
woman and you realize that you need to
balance a lot of things I think I would
like to get married
post 27 that's too late 25 when I can
see a beach I can see a lot of people
having fun but don't tell me everybody
will have two bikinis and all that
if you hurt so my mum and I are like
frenemies sometimes were like really
good friends but then sometimes we have
a off moment so when I think of marriage
is about two souls who want to get
together and mom got mad she was
independent she was like standing on her
own two feet and like that that's a good
thing that's what I want to do that's
why I want to get and once I get that
yeah I'm open all option he is a very
practical pragmatic kind of person she
would probably feel like a chaos from
inside but not sure the biggest
differences was in her case she was told
to get married and you know she kind of
yeah fine she agreed to it it wasn't
really now given but in my case she
wants me to be happy for she wants me to
settle and then marriage is on the cards
but not so soon the first thing that
she'll tell me when I'm getting ready is
whatever you wear you will look good I
was telling her that don't worry about
my marriage
she's like no this is damn stressful
when will you get married and blah blah
blah I'm like don't
my reflection oh my god oh my god look
so beautiful
flashback up that he is back she is
looking more beautiful than me that's my
son haha she's looking traditional to
get her into something like this is it
has must will be a feat everything is
same X and is got expenses of the
clothes are done I'll wear this one
she's looking more beautiful than me of
course
Oh Sun possible yeah it is I'm so proud
get to my degree sure and I given a
birth to a baby girl I'm actually very
overwhelmed nothing but the best for my
daughter that day you should look
different and you will look different
just waiting for the real day real D Day
again you'll have to wait for some time
