have handprints left on my face when I
removed my hand no I mean are you
excited about yeah my heart is racing so
today I'm going to be transformed into
my mom I remember a phase of not wanting
to hang out with you like in my late
teens mid teens and then in my early 20s
until now you're like one of my best
friends my mom and I have a really great
relationship I would consider her not
just my best friend but also my personal
inspiration she's a great mom don't cry
I'm recreating a picture of when you
were 23 which is how old I am
right now well when I was 23 I was
having the time of my life I was
carrying around this cute little bundle
of joy Alex has always liked to dress up
like Disney characters and I think in
this one she was in her jasmin little
face and I was fixing her hair as she
did until ninth grade probably yeah I
was 28 at the time at that time I was
pregnant with my fourth child she makes
the cookies for all my friends she does
our laundry she has us over for movie
nights she was married and already had a
child by the time she was my age
and I'm nowhere even close but I've
barely you know moved to the place I
wanted to live and gotten a job that I
wanted to get just recently the past few
months so I think she was a little a lot
more ahead in her lifetime at the age of
25 that I am growing up in a mixed-race
family was a very different experience
than I think a lot of people have a lot
of kids told me when I was younger that
like I didn't look like my mom or it was
impossible for my mom to
and it's so interesting to me because I
think I actually have a lot of person
physical features and the only
difference is skin color there's four of
us and we always came first
always and she's just the first person I
call for anything and so it's just
knowing that she's there and being a
friend more than a month she's a very
hard worker so even though she was
bringing up four kids she always worked
full-time but she was always there when
I was nervous okay and I also have no
idea what I look like oh my gosh Oh
twinsies
ah oh my gosh they look like you Wow
yeah India Delta oh my god oh my god I
sound like you oh my god oh my god I'm
doing what I used to look like why would
your hair so she should wear it because
I had I do like it belt
do I know
this is bizarre it's like looking at
myself well it's like looking at my mom
through my five-year-old eyes I remember
seeing this I remember playing with her
when she looked like this and dressed
like this just it kind of makes me I
don't know kind of sad or tell me sad
well it is it's just come on man
I missed those days I love your dreams
and I love your determination she's just
a yes woman she says yes to everything
and I love that about my mom
I love how kind you are and nice you are
and how much you gave up to provide a
life for me I love that when Alex does
set a goal she gives a hundred and ten
percent
thanks for being my rock well I love you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
