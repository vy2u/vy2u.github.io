until he asked me to send him money
after two and a half years of chatting
with a girl online I found out I've been
catfished today I went on a date with a
guy I met online
he brought his mom I made a guy I met
online drive an hour and a half to see
me but never showed up
the closest thing to a relationship I've
ever been in was a girl I met online so
I met this guy online we went on a date
ish thing and I was going to spend the
night who's a cool guy but a cover hog
so I left in the middle of the night
online dating someone stopped talking to
me for liking country music um are you
stupid I didn't know what a basic bitch
was until I tried online dating last
year my friends and I catfished a former
professor on match.com last time I met
someone online he turned out to be 40
years old and stalked me for a year
after three dates in a week span he
proposed to me that's probably a sign to
stop online dating I met my drug dealer
on OkCupid she is the best hookup I have
ever had thank you modern world
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
