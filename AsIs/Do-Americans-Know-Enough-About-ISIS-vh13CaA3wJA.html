British teenagers join Isis you're like
why would you do that do they have like
a bunch of iPhones that are given out oh
come on I don't know
it stands for doesn't that for anything
I thought it meant something
is it an acronym probably not Islamic
state ezel of a state that doesn't make
any sense I read this article where
Muslims were very upset that it has the
word Islamic in the front in the title
because it doesn't represent the Islamic
state interactive social
incomprehensible sadness I think that's
right I think I got this it's also ISIL
it's also just the Islamic state where
is Isis mostly on the Internet Isis is
huge on Twitter they have a great social
media team and apparently the seducing
teens over the Internet they have a
headquarters maybe in the Middle East
I'm not sure specifically where I'm just
gonna go with the Middle East
I bet Iraq had enough problems they need
another thing I probably some very angry
old man I wonder if there are people who
think they're in charge of Isis if
they're like they're like five different
people like I'm really the head of Isis
and but I know like I know Troy thinks
he's the head of Isis but don't listen
to Troy come to me if you've got any
problems like I'm the head of Isis if
you told me the leader of Isis was
Sauron from Lord of the Rings I would
leave you in a heartbeat
I'm not really sure what their pitch is
when they go in for meetings in terms of
money but I know that they have a crazy
net worth is it like in the millions
more than a billion no no it's in the
billions who gave them that that is like
a fifth of what snapchat is worth oh can
I get Wikipedia out or something not
from developing iPhone apps stealing it
they're stealing it we're asking a quick
quick cash Craigslist just sells stuff
they have in their garage on Craigslist
hey what's the one that everybody uses
now then Moe I don't know it's through a
venmo illegal oil sales are they like
sneaky integers like this is like just
grabbing some oil I'm in like saikachi
broil is that a really how they're doing
it
so my question is who's buying this oil
from that must be heavily discounted
that's not why all prices are so cheap
right now is it I doubt there's actually
a registration form it's probably just
your handed in ak-47 and a bandanna zero
moat with a crocodile around us like the
outsider like you know like black clouds
always looming over a castle with a
lightning bolt behind it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
