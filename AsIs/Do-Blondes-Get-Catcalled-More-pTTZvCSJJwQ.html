would look in the mirror and be like
whoa like shit's real now you know young
and in college and try new things I I
think as many girls do you go through
the Marilyn Monroe phase I guess I
wasn't having such a great year so I was
like let me do something that makes me
feel happy I was getting ready to
audition for grease and I really wanted
to be Rizzo started going totally blonde
by accident by just highlighting my hair
too much but I feel like as a blonde I
wanted to be taken seriously so I was a
little more like I had to work to be
serious once I dyed my hair back to
brown I was hurt first on scene second I
definitely notice that I get stared at
more just like flat-out dare not when I
have loose blond hair it'll be the
cheerleader or the girlfriend or the
sorority girl and then now that it's
gotten a little bit darker it's more
like the college friend weave blonde
hair they kind of see you more as like
an object almost guys think you're
Dumber a lot of the time which sounds
really obvious but it's really really
true good so blondie are you think I
called snowflake a lot snow bunny
those are all options when I'm a blonde
there's just this like lack of filter
like the aggression is so much more
palpable don't even realize what color
hair you have until you are cat called
once definitely have more fun but I
think I just have more fun than most
people I guess blondes in a way have
more fun because they have a little bit
more lowered expectations than people so
you can like I was saying you can get
away with a lot I think blonde similar
but I have a lot of fun in Sanibel so
you can never escape it I guess we all
just have to shave our heads</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
