literally all my life but not like the
dark sultry exotic type more like middle
throwed brown brown and more Brown in a
city where being blonde is a calling
card I'm here to find out do blondes
have more fun
so here's the thing fun is kind of
subjective and really not that
measurable so I'm gonna put myself
through a series of tests both as a
blonde and a brunette to see if my life
is different
sighs here are the tests the blind
survey test is where I send to BuzzFeed
interns out onto the streets of LA with
my picture and they ask participants
their first impression of me the tinder
test is where I create two different
tinder profiles and swipe right or yes a
hundred times to see how many matches I
get off the bat and finally the street
harassment test where I strap a GoPro
onto a co-worker and walk around
Hollywood for 90 minutes to see if I get
more attention as a blonde or a brunette
this is circle do words that best
describe your first impression of this
girl
I said serious talkative and artsy say
intimidating because me as a girl I know
looking at someone what an intimidating
look is and she looks like she can take
you down pretty easily I don't want to
tamper with our scientific what's the
word I'm looking for a while all right
our data point thank you
I don't want to tamper with our data
points so for my bio I just put dating
apps or weird period we should probably
just chat period seems pretty innocuous
right okay here we go
okay so it's been five minutes I've just
swiped right on everyone who's come up
and I have gotten 33 matches as a
brunette all right I guess I guess
that's all the demon
right usually I would be stoked if no
one cat called me but when no one
approached me in this experiment I
couldn't help but wonder if it had
anything to do with my hair so I took to
the streets of Hollywood one last time
to talk to people to see if they thought
blondes have more fun
or at least got more attention a blonde
bring alone more energy I think they're
allowed to have more fun I think blonds
get like a bi do you think that blondes
have more fun
why just crazy do you see that look did
you get that look so to be completely
honest I don't think that blondes have
more fun I think we all have fun if we
allow ourselves to have fun I'm doing
this to see if society perceives me
differently as a blonde
I don't think Devin strikes me as a
blonde hmm I don't know I like her
current hair color she's a beautiful
human being
so she doesn't need to go blonde to be
more beautiful
oh god I'm really I'm actually kind of
feeling nervous because what if I become
a blonde and I don't feel like I like
how people react to me but everyone
seems to like me better as a blonde I
like blondes I like Devin I don't know
if I'd like Devin more as a blonde at
this point I had done my research
I talked to almost everyone in LA and it
was time it was time to meet with my
friends at Pravana and to do the deed it
was time to go blonde
it's a bold color it's AI catchy and
gets you a lot of attention I find a lot
of times you know I work with a lot of
blondes here in LA and anytime I've made
someone a little bit darker they've
always said they don't get quite as much
attention being darker okay so what do
you see for me as far as like blondes
like I'm gonna take you there you're not
gonna half-ass it I'm really gonna do it
I want you to be like blonde I want you
to walk out of the salon and people see
you as being a boy I'm not convinced
that changing the color your hair is
gonna actually do anything I think it's
like maybe there's a placebo effect to
it but I will say somebody who's gone
blonde before she's gonna feel very
different I really think I'll have to to
see it to believe it
I like
I have to work and I like immediately
ran into our bathroom
and haven't really come out yet so I'm
really nervous I don't feel good I feel
like really uncomfortable because it's
like everywhere I go people are whoa
whoa and I know they're doing it because
it's so different for me but it feels
like I have all eyes on me so after I
got over the emotional shock of changing
my hair color I had to get back to the
experiment
this included recreating all the
pictures that I'd used before
this is so weird I'm just sitting in the
car with two other people take a selfie
and then sending my colleagues out yet
again with another blind survey while I
stayed behind and continued to tender I
think she looks happy actually she's got
a little smirk like an inner smile
what's the match warming curious because
she's like curious I don't know she
looks kind of curious their eyes are
like big and they open so the data isn't
fully even in yet and right now I feel
like a lot more fellows or hollering at
me ears and on let's see how I did
Wow 8888 out of a hundred as a blonde on
tinder those numbers are insane
88 233 Wow
I feel like I might cry um that's so
stupid do you think
I don't know I kind of wanted like I
feel like I want to abandon this project
right now I feel like I'm like oh
this I don't want to know anymore well
we're gonna we're gonna go forth we're
gonna continue the experiment at this
point the experiment was really getting
under my skin but I still had one last
part of the puzzle to figure out it was
time for the catcall test just you know
for continuity sake I am wearing the
same dress I am carrying the same bag
the only thing that is different is
there when I went out and walking on the
streets of LA I had three experiences
where three different men did that
whisper thing and one whispered about
the way I was walking one whispered that
I was like hot and then someone
whispered about my which is just I
have a vagina so throughout this
experiment I have learned that as a
blonde
I get more tender dates I've learned
that as a blonde people assume that I'm
sweet and curious they use softer words
when describing me and I've learned that
I get more Street attention did I have
more fun as a blonde and then I think I
kind of had the same amount of fun no
matter what I'm definitely keeping my
hair for Halloween because I wanted to
be Daenerys from Game of Thrones so hard
for a long time I've got two cats I'm
gonna dress them up as my dragons I'm
gonna be the mother of dragons it's
gonna be</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
