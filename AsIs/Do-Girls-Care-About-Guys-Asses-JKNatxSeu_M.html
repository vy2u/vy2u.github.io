about guys dances as much they care
about ours do you care about how guys
asses look yes it needs to be tight and
leet need to look like Magic Mike sighs
very nice that's why girls watch that
movie yeah this looks like surprising

do you as a girl care about guys asses
like have you ever looked at in lusted
over like oh look at that-air absolutely
be seen my husband's ass that's a that
is actually a pretty nice ass would you
tell them like compliment them then tell
them it's nice or anything yeah probably
like squeeze it or something I grab it
and just say I like it
well I wouldn't touch because I know
that guys are like kind of iffy about
that area so it looked maybe compliment
on it and if I get this prenup
permission maybe touch you have a very
nice bottom you know it's very round and
plump and I just feel like for a guy
would you want it to be soft or hard
probably a little harder I mean you want
something to hold on to to you know I
mean it's a same kind of deal would you
rather date a guy with a big ass or
smaller big definitely not small long so
either medium to long it's nice to have
something to grab on to what like is the
best material to look at a guy's asked
her sweat pants or jeans for sure if you
had to rate your husband's ass on a
scale of one to ten what would you rate
it 11 oh you are a writer she's getting
yay
have you had to give a guy's ass a
nickname like how we have ours you know
like dog or monkey or Fanny what would
you call a guy that like Bubber Bubber
something like that you want to give him
a compliment about his ass nice ass is
very tight firm and it looks nice and
gee that's a very nice ass do you think
that we a girls should start
complimenting guys on behalf of more me
