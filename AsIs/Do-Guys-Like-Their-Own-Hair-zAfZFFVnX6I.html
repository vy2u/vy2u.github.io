that deals with body image but we don't
do a lot of stuff that deals with male
body image and I happen to know that
most guys are self-conscious about their
hair so today I'm gonna walk around and
ask the guys a BuzzFeed if they like
their own hair do you like your own hair
no I hate my hair what person in the
office if you could have their hair who
would it be I want somebody with like
super thick beautiful gorgeous hair I
want Shane sir
Shane's here what's going on Shane first
off do you like your hair
no well Stevie said he would like your
hair Steve would like my hair yeah yeah
if I don't like keep it back it just it
just hangs in my face what person in the
office and you can have their hair who
would it be quite honestly I like
Brandon's hair Brandon do you like your
oh no I hate my hair no Zach Gibson has
a pretty nice hair actually yeah I
really do like my own hair yeah I think
it's a well-kept secret that all guys
don't like their own hair I think I
think about my hair like three times a
day
Colin's looking good I'll go with
columns hair yeah he's got a good
haircut right now my arms all right I
think about my hair more than I would
ever care to admit I think you've got
pretty sexy hair right thanks Ben miss
Ferraro also has nice hair in general
would you say you're self-conscious
about your hair more so that people
would think yeah for sure
I actually really likes adamson Adam
have one question for you don't ask do
you like your hair
I don't think I don't wants to play it
so we're just gonna skip y'all guys
Harris is pretty basic and boring just
inten has a pretty cool hairstyle that's
alright alright it's kind of kind of
like yours so yours
so your hair by that rule is not that
great he tried to make anything told
about me
really it's ultimate self anyways mr.
Zack Evans has great hair I thought
every guy loved his own hair I'm shocked
right now I am very self-conscious I'm
like a cowlick right here in the back oh
I'd have Eugene's hair like easy money a
Eugene Eugene has nice hair Eugene has
amazing hair I'm sure a lot of people
have said Eugene but I couldn't rock
here the hairstyle like Eugene Ken so
let's not messing around let's go to the
man that God himself let's find Eugene
yeah I'm self-conscious about my hair
for sure yeah especially like if you see
anyone with styled anything it implies a
certain amount of self-consciousness
right because you're putting up time and
effort and thought into making yourself
look look presentable we just dropped a
major truth bomb on me I think I need to
go sit in a chair for a couple of
minutes as yet if I could have anyone's
hair in this office it'd be Quinta
Brunson alright so there you have it
every guy in there self-conscious about
his own hair no matter how great his
hair is according to other guys
including myself so now that the
secret's out let's enjoy this terrifying
montage of everybody Photoshop with the
hair that they wanted
if you could have somebody's hair in
this office who would it be
it wouldn't happen to be me it could be
me you could say that you want oh look
guy yeah I'm with Quinta alright well I
mean you could have said me everybody I
just I know you wanted to say in your
heart</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
