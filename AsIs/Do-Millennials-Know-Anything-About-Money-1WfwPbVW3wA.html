should take your advice based on the
answers you've given me but do you have
any advice for younger people about
starting to save for their future um
don't be like me can I see you a
question sure do you think you have a
good relationship with money no not at
all I'm decent everything I know is from
my mom I started saving when I was about
five and I had my first job when I was
about ten what yeah is illegal what are
some things recreational things that are
acceptable spend money on I mean
anything if you're smart about it
I sort of reversed engineered it I I
knew what I needed which is like Spotify
Netflix what do you spend money on that
maybe you should that you could you know
alcohol every time I over dreyfus like
where dude it's like word again do you
have like a an alcohol budget cuz you
know what happens those night rego out
you get everybody drinks and you end up
with your crap oh wait how much you
spend on alcohol like a week they I have
to say I'm Cameron we like me to get
obliterated at the end of the wait
because we're so stressed it's kind of
sad it's like this perfect capitalist
cycle
what's capitalist mean it's the system
that we live in where we work endlessly
to make the fat cuts butter and we're
just the plebs
yes system is the system x1 makes me
nervous about getting involved with
money well you don't even know what
capitalism is I'm gonna feel bad about
that I'm this series about learning and
teaching me things do you know the
difference between a 401k and Roth IRA
no I mean I'm just like a responsible
young boy oh god I'm bad at that so a
Roth IRA tax money is taken out before
you put it into this account do you have
money saved I have a savings account is
it money in it it's a little bit I mean
I have none so what do you think is a
good age where people start saving 25
that's a really good question
next week I'm turning 29 so next week
fire 30 I think you should have 20k
saved
where do people learn about being
responsible of money the Internet I bet
or yeah
what mmm we're just talk talk to your
parents talk to people that are older
than you cuz supposedly they know more
than we do right that's what I keep
hearing but no I just keep getting older
and I'm not getting any smarter they
should teach that in school should be
like a requirement right I mean do you
have any advice for young people what
they should start doing in order to plan
for their future better if anything I
would spend my money on traveling more
than like beers
take a little bit out of any paycheck
you make and put it in under your
mattress that'll help you not touch it
you think having cash will help you not
touch it
savings account for sure will hmm do we
trust the bank I actually don't look at
my statements very often me there
sometimes I spend so much that I get
afraid of looking at it click here to

glass of wine and your best friends
