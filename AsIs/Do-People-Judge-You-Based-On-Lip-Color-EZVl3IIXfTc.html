this week I'm gonna find out if people
really judge you differently based on
your lip color when I was younger I was
always a little apprehensive about
trying different lip colors I remember
this one time I walked into a makeup
store and I put on a dark black lipstick
and I thought I looked so cool but one
of my friends just automatically told me
to take it off and told me that I looked
goth and scary it was just so strange to
me because one I think God stuff is
really cool and two I didn't really
think that wearing a different lip shade
all of a sudden changed my personality
it was then that I realized that the
makeup that you wear really makes people
see you differently so this week I'm
gonna try four different lip shades to
see if people perceive me differently
based on them so I'm gonna wear a black
shade to bring out the inner goth in me
a bright pink lipstick which I'm not
used to kind of a bright clean lipstick
that is totally out of this world for me
and I'm also going to be wearing a
bright red lip so I'm gonna do three
different tests I'm gonna go around the
office and see how my friends react next
I'm gonna go on the street and see how
strangers feel about my lip shades and
finally I'm gonna do a blind survey to
get an honest opinion of how people
really feel about my lip shades let's
give it a go so the first lip shade I'm
gonna be trying is the black one oh my
god yeah I definitely look like my
Catholic schools worst nightmare
all right day one here we go
I see what's the exact same with like a
night live during the day so maybe yeah
I'm judging it looks good I sent a
picture of my face
to my sister and she sends me back a
picture of Marilyn Manson and says that
was my first reaction I'll admit that if
I didn't know you I would think you were
a little witchy you look unhappy I'm
starting to realized that a lot of
people at my work office are kind of
used to this kind of stuff so being just
seems to see what people think out on
the street so we're out here on the
streets of Hollywood I'm gonna go see
what people think my lip color let's do
this please be completely honest with me
what does my lip color say about me if I
saw you walking down the street under my
queen what kind of judgments would you
make on me based on this lip color edgy
confident you look like somebody I want
to be friends with regret ass thank you
I look badass so often people who wear
bright pink or purplish lipsticks are
perceived as attention seekers I'm gonna
wear it anyways but I kind of want to
see if it changes the way people treat
me this color is kind of fun I feel like
Katy Perry but I also feel like a clown
what do you think my lip color says
about me I think it said that you like
flowers
oh thank you
comfortable making super bowl fresh
increases I think no offense if it seems
like you're trying so I'm definitely
getting some double takes with this lip
color but I'm definitely noticing that
people are looking at me differently
what does my lip color say about I feel
like it says that you're very like
bubbly person to be honest when I first
like mine I saw I was like oh man who
let that girl do that to herself
so you guys are from Maryland I know
we're in Hollywood but in Maryland is
this a normal thing oh no no not at all
if I were to walk around like this in
Maryland what do you think people would
think about us you could try and be a
white girl honestly I know the bold
faded but I think they will say I would
say she's got to be a singer performer
or maybe even a stripper when it comes
to red lipsticks I've heard that people
who wear them are perceived as
promiscuous or that they seek danger do
you seem like you're into having a good
time why is this amber with you it's
because they're luscious red lips yeah
there's something like very classy like
Kenna okay I like that color just looks
different on different skin types since
mine is so dark these colors tend to pop
a lot more and I think it also brings
some other judgments as well what does
my lip color say about me you look like
you could be an entertainment maybe even
makeup you probably read vogue or
Cosmopolitan magazine do you think in a
work environment it would be kind of the
wrong attention maybe not the wrong kind
of attention but just a lot of on eyes
on you and it wouldn't be because of
what your contributions are in a meeting
or what your skill sets are it will be
because you're wearing this lipstick hey
Catherine guess what data's it's green
it just feels so bizarre I can't even
look at myself I feel like I'm mostly
just like afraid of other people's
reactions what does it say about me why
are you doing this you are someone who
like knows your style and Lanka's may
come from with it like you know she
didn't look in the mirror this morning
look like John or Joe or I would be like
she don't I know you good job so I'm
here with Jasmine the bold look master I
think you're doing it perfect it's gonna
be a lot for you to handle because it's
a lot for me to handle and I wear
lipstick every day I just kind of put it
on and not give a what people think
about you and just broccoli you thank
you what does my lip color say about me
it's unusual it's very unique
but outgoing it's not really my color
now I wouldn't really like it I'm not
for it on me but it looks good on you it
made me think maybe I should try that
for a long time I found it hard to put
on bread bright red lipstick red
lipstick on a dark-skinned person it's
like a very Western thing that's been
projected on black women you've got good
lips so why not even though I got great
answers for my co-workers and people on
the street I knew I needed a more
unbiased way to get real responses of
what people thought of my lip shade so
because of that I made a survey
I asked about 150 people from all around
the country so look at pictures of my
face and tell me what they really think
I gave them four pictures of me wearing
all the different lip shade colors and
then I ask them questions related to
what my age is what my income level is
what my occupation is what my education
level is and lastly what my personality
traits are so the results are in and I'm
gonna see how people really judge me
based on my lip color I feel like I've
just opened this up to the world to talk
complete about me so I really hope
that these responses are positive for
age those people thought that I was
between the age of 22 and 25 for the
pink lip color a lot of people thought
that I was between
18 and 21 with every other lip color it
seems like everyone thought that I was
the same age that I am right now I'm 23
but wearing the bright lip color made me
look younger when I came saying to come
most people thought I earn between
20,000 and 50,000 a year go out for
green 32-point 22% of people thought
that I earned between $0 and around
$20,000 a year there were a lot of
people who thought that I was unemployed
and who thought that I didn't earn a lot
of money because I was wearing green
lipstick education this is where it was
kind of interesting and most people
thought that I was a college student
just comparing the results of the green
lips shade to the red lip shade are
interesting because sixty percent of
people thought that I went to college
when I was wearing red lipstick zero
percent of people thought that I had
less than a high school education and 41
percent of people thought that I went to
college wearing the green lip shade so
it's just such a dramatic difference
because this isn't even 50% kind of
occupation it seems like the majority of
people thought that I was a student
which I guess is a nice way of saying
unemployed for occupation for the red
lip shade 19 point 57 percent of people
thought that I was a businesswoman
whereas 17 point 39 percent of people
thought I was in the entertainment
industry or I was a student which is
really cool people thought that I had my
 together yay so the next option was
personality traits I thought this was
really interesting because it gave
people an all-around way to express how
they really felt about me with that lip
shade personality treats for the red
lipstick top three most voted four
personality traits were confident
creative fun
the top three least voted four
personality traits were childish
unprofessional and unreliable I think
that basically is the definition of
adulting so for the black lip most voted
for personality traits were confident
serious and creative the top three least
voted four personality traits were
promiscuous childish disorganized and
the life of the party they look at me as
someone who is serious can probably get
a job done for the pink lip color top
three most voted for personality traits
were confident fun and creative three
least voted four personality traits were
disorganized quick
anger and unreliable when it comes to
the personality traits for the green
lipstick most voted for personality
traits were attention seeker creative
confident police voted for personality
traits were quick to anger professional
and also serious interesting to see
professional and serious so low because
with the black love shade in the red lip
shade it was so up there I see that
there's a lot of common trends most
people thought that I was confident and
creative most people thought that I was
a student or a fashion industry worker I
guess I'm really surprised I didn't
really think that something as small as
the color that you wear on your lips
could really affect how people see you
so much when I was walking around with
all of those lip colors I was taking
risks and I enjoyed that the best thing
about fashion is taking risks and not
being afraid to push boundaries because
of what people might think about you or
say about you I mean I don't see any
reason and letting that stop you from
being yourself and killing it go out
there and wear a green lipstick
basically that's the news now you girls
know y'all you can watch out now
