yourself up so you just threw everything
on your face took me a long time to do
I'll have you know
this week I'm gonna find out if people
judge you based on your makeup my
coworker Salome made this awesome video
that asked if people judge you based on
your lip color and that got me thinking
do people judge you based on your makeup
as a whole like how much you wear or how
little you wear so I want to try three
different looks and ask people what they
honestly think of each one I'm gonna do
one day of zero makeup which I'm super
nervous about Clinton if I go out like
that as a regular makeup and a day of
total full face I'm going where my have
the same every day and wear the same
plain colored clothes every day just so
the only thing that changes is my face
I'm gonna ask my co-workers and my
friends what their first impressions are
of each look and then to get a more
unbiased opinion I'm gonna hit the
streets and are strangers what keywords
they would use to describe me to add
another angle I'm gonna post each lick
on social media and ask everyone to
comment honestly so the first thing I'm
gonna try is the full face
my initial thing would be I wonder if
she's insecure that's so messed up I'm
working on it
I would say you're very bold it's very
extra someone who's maybe very concerned
with how they're projecting to the
outside world but for some reason when I
see so I'm like while they're doing the
most no when you see women like a full
face of makeup I usually think they're
like a boss ass bitch you know I would
just look at you and think like she must
be dope you know like the super stark
contrast and the lip makeup and it just
pops you can tell like you spent a lot
of time with everything so this is so
long this is the first video that this
is based off you're someone who
definitely like likes to look good you
know someone who likes to like just
present themselves well I would say like
are you getting ready for an event where
are you going
can I come did you judge me when you saw
me no oh yeah you looked a little pale
I have not done this contouring well so
with my co-workers there was a mix of
positive and negative responses but they
did sway more towards the negative one
other thing I noticed a lot of people
saying was that they assume someone
wearing this look would be going to some
kind of special event which makes me
think maybe there'd be judgment there if
it turns out the person was just doing
this everyday as a normal look let's hit
the streets and talk to some absolute
strangers if you saw me walking down the
street what kind of words would you use
to describe what kind of person you
think I am somewhat lazy I guess I
suppose I would think you're probably
with like a higher class independent and
gorgeous I think a lot of people are
gonna judge you regardless so you just
have to find what you like and just to
do whatever you want to do I've never
worn anything not heavy in the daytime
so I don't know if it's what's awful lot
but yeah I don't have anything wrong
with it
maybe you just or put on makeup I don't
look like a diva less makeup is better
do you ever notice when women wear a lot
of makeup I open it I can notice this
but you don't judge them if you can look
better and make yourself feel better so
why not
so surprisingly to me I actually got
mostly positive responses from strangers
even though women he didn't wear a lot
of makeup with totally non judgmental
about my look there were a couple of men
though that were not feeling my look and
so it was too heavy it was fine for
social media to chime in
I got a large range of opinions for this
look ranging from bold and fierce to not
trustworthy and high-maintenance but the
key words that repeated themselves the
most were confident
timah dating and going somewhere with
the big winner being party girl again it
seems like this look says nighttime and
me wandering around in the day like this
causes judgment so the second look is my
regular amount of makeup let's do it
if I didn't know you I would think that
you are probably on your way to work
or maybe out on a date it seems like a
normal level you have on your full face
but it's nothing like whoa you look like
you put in effort in the morning and you
look like you know professional but not
too much the only way that I judge
people based on their makeup is like how
talented they might be at makeup it's
never a you wear that much makeup it's
damn that's a precise eyeliner you make
certain assumptions if they're wearing
colorful makeup maybe they are a little
more creative and weird if they're
wearing like you know a lot of like
whatever contouring and stuff they're
probably a fancy person I don't know
makeup is just so fluid like there's no
wrong way to do it so it's not like a
judge in a negative form would you
notice my makeup or not no cool
I do notice people's makeup I think I
noticed a lot when they do the full face
but when it's more natural it's kind of
just like not really noticeable to me as
I suspected this look didn't really
raised many eyebrows and no one really
had strong opinions about it everyone I
speak to you just have this scene like a
regular day-to-day look most people said
oh you know it's my makeup if I was
wearing more of it but now let's get
some stranger's opinions on the streets
for me that is more than enough
less is more nice but I like your you
look fresh and clean I see you're going
to work maybe someone that deals with
people or maybe on that counter I don't
really like when girls wear makeup
because I think girls have a natural
beauty you've got a perfect amount of
makeup I just don't wear that much
makeup but like it doesn't look bad like
a bunch of my friends wear makeup I just
seem too lazy to put it on every morning
so this time the people I interviewed
weren't really into makeup and had kind
of a less-is-more opinion however even
the people that went into makeup said my
look wasn't too much and that it was
like a going to work look or something
if any of social media time this look
had the most unified responses of all of
them professional was by far the most
popular keyword followed by natural
sweet and then words that suggested I
cared just the right amount about my
appearance and now it's time for my most
nerve-wracking look zero makeup
I would assume that you just like
prioritize other things you look
approachable fun
you're a very confident flawless person
so like if you're going out in public
you're either a just like not a makeup
wearing kind of person or you're having
like like a errands day or you're
someone who maybe doesn't need makeup so
you're very laid-back and don't really
care what other people think you're not
looking to impress if you're not wearing
makeup yeah which is a shitty thing to
say when you asked me I thought you
might be wearing makeup because your
eyebrows already look so nice if you
already have a mic regulated I also
didn't realize that you weren't wearing
makeup I honestly don't think I would
notice now that you say it like oh yeah
like she's not doing it I might notice
if someone's very done up because then
I'm like oh like what's going on are
they going out clubbing are they a movie
star I know that when I don't wear
makeup I always feel like I'm gonna be
judged I always think that people might
think that I am NOT like a full
professional like I have it all together
I was pretty surprised that most people
didn't even notice that wasn't wearing
makeup but Kelsey made a good point she
feels super insecure when she doesn't
wear makeup but when other people don't
wear it she doesn't even notice I think
I was more judgmental about my look than
anyone else was let's go out and find
some random strangers and see what
bathing what keywords would you use to
describe what kind of person you think I
am I would say I would guess that you're
comfortable in your own skin I would
probably go so you're probably laid-back
very chill going through life everyday
being yourself casual not really caring
how you look you know you do you so I
don't have a preference as you wear
makeup you were making if you don't you
don't would you judge someone that
doesn't wear makeup at all
no I mean I have enough feminist friends
and been a part of feminist communities
to know that and it's a lot of pressure
put on women to wear makeup to attain a
certain standard of beauty that's
acceptable in society I don't wear
makeup myself so I wouldn't make a
judgement and being someone that wears a
lot of makeup I don't have like a
problem with people that don't wear
makeup I almost admire it cuz like I
just feel I need to wear makeup but I
just I like it also you know
don't notice people who don't wear
makeup so sometimes it's raised too I'm
like a little a little something with a
man of help nearly everyone I spoke to
was super positive about a no makeup
look I was expecting to get a lot of you
look lazy or tired but instead I got a
lot of just you look chill they mostly
had a you do you attitude about it so
weirdly social media commenters were way
more judgmental about this look than
both my co-workers and the people on the
street although still more positive than
negative they have much stronger
opinions the most popular negative
judgement I got was doesn't care / lazy
the most popular positive comments were
that I don't have time or that I look
natural that overwhelmingly highest
comment though was confident
so although confidence is a positive
word why do we have to be confident to
go around without makeup like it's
something it takes a lot of balls to do
so for all of this I have definitely
learned some interesting things in
general people are way more accepting
your people's makeup decisions than I
originally assumed but there are
definitely some common thoughts that go
with each look wearing a lot of makeup
makes people assume that you must be
going somewhere special because they
can't wrap their head around the fact
that you might just be chilling wearing
that much wearing what I would consider
my normal level of makeup made people
think that I was presentable and
professional and zero makeup people
either don't notice or they think you
must be pretty confident to go out
without anything on your face
all in all yes people do judge you based
on your makeup whether it's positive or
negative but you know what who cares
what really matters is what makes you
feel your best
actually my friend Zack put it perfectly
so he can be the one to end the video
keep wearing makeup
if you want to don't worry if you don't
want to keep doing your thing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
