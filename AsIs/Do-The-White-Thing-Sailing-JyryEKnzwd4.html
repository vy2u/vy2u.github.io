we're about to go sailing
my name is Quinta and we are about to go
boating sailing yo what up my name is
Jamar neighbors and we bout to go
sailing and when I think about sailing I
think about the Titanic I think about
Amistad I just imagined that that's the
only time that like rich white people
you really see them do manual labor I
don't I don't like boats Asians like to
go do stuff for a purpose like go
shrimping or get on a boat to escape a
war-torn country I've never at all
thought of people of color being on
boats unless they were working I also
can't swim so I think it's important to
understand where a lot of my fear comes
from
yes so guys one rule is if you're moving
around always one hand on the top all
right Cody release us here we go what's
the name of your boat Annie poltergeist
your your your boat's name is
poltergeist Oh guys I see some sea lions
Oh
all right so I want you to steer this
and your goal here is to keep this sail
full of wind so you'll feel it know that
oh okay this rocks behind us yet
not that much pretty soon oh okay yeah
there you go you're doing good you're
sailing right now excuse me Amy
I am the captain now oh wait Amy we are
going to address take us away from the
ruts yeah don't put your hands on it are
you guys ready
mmm you're gonna tack it ready quit that
I'm right pull pull pull
I'm second Oh a little bit more
yeah you did yes I'm starting to
understand why this is such a popular
activity that's light one thing I'm bad
relax right now so alright ready for the
bone we want to go straight out to the
pole at the end so see if you can get us
there and don't hit this selling up ahh
I'm selling about yeah you get natural
feel
and it's like a car yes with slower
reaction time then good
it's the winch
starboard you forgot this thing over
here we are about to go into the ocean
we are and it's about to get choppy well
I just saw that coat go live through out
into the water
open ocean I don't like that I don't
like this yeah I'm scared must be this
production value is crazy the scariest
part was leaving the marina and going
out into the actual ocean because that's
when things started to change and it got
real it got real real real fast and I
didn't like that yeah we're all good
guys there you go yeah and that's it you
have to be tough to sail yeah you got a
muscle like I gave birth
watch out the motor spit i I do kind of
wish that I kind of want to drive a boat
to Catalina let's go let's go
now I wanna buy boat we're live we're
here yeah y'all know what I did today
look I sell a boat all right I saw seals
and shit let's last time you saw silk
card Oh exactly never seen one I saw one
today no I do not have black friends

that sentence before because no one's
asked me such a ludicrous question</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
