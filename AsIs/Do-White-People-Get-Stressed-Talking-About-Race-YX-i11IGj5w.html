daily way and we have Lindsay answer
that question first race doesn't pop in
my head every day just living my
everyday life that completely comes last
I think about it all the time and I
think it's cool that you don't have to
think about it because it's a huge
burden I was raised in a very white
suburban town my whole childhood was
just surrounded by people who looked
like me race was never in the
conversation so much I wouldn't say that
I've talked about race a lot throughout
my life when the topic of race comes up
it's not something that I'm a pretty
loud voice in so I don't feel like I
have the experience to be a voice in
that conversation
I'm gonna try hard not to be quiet but
I'll be doing people who just have I
guess a closer connection to the issues
feel like I was very privileged growing
up and I don't know what it feels like
to be discriminated against I don't
really almost have the right to talk
about it
race is still a really big issue I wish
we lived in a world where he didn't need
to talk about it but I feel like we do I
agree with you Derek can't we all just
be people but I know that that's not
real to say like oh like I'm a good
white a life like inherently is like
that makes me feel uneasy I'm also a
little uncomfortable the term white Ally
I feel like it's very separating
personally I don't feel like I have
anything to contribute all of the time
to discussions on Facebook or like
social media so I stay absent from them
a big important part of being an ally is
being a listener this conversation is
definitely tricky the fact that it's
just hard to talk about just shows that
we all need to get really comfortable
talking about race I feel like I was
super comfortable we were all kind of
coming from the same place both racially
but also the opinion wise for the most
part we had the same line of opinion
there's always a degree of awkwardness I
think when it comes to talking about
race just a white guilt thing that we
have to deal with I felt comfortable
expressing myself it was fine first of
all gotta have diverse friends because
someone has to talk to the cops
definitely that's not more yeah do you
think that when people see you the first
thing they see is your blackness yeah I
always think about how that is the first
thing people yeah but I love that the
definition of like what black is it's a
whole nother conversation
I'm not typically a black American my
family's from the Caribbean so it's
totally different upbringing I made
something that was made by an Asian
American women and that means something
Josh do you feel that I was wondering if
like white people feel that same way
like dude do you hold that like whatever
you do here you do as a white man yeah
not at all right yes yeah that's like
the difference I think go beyond like
just the loud and the violence that is
being shown this is a conversation I
should be happening on TV when I was
growing up I didn't care I can talk to
you guys and totally you know care
because I know you and I hear your
stories but I was not surrounded by that
whatsoever to even like think about
protesting for someone that I
and Nicko Rometty but definitely very
plain yes dear definitely very fair yeah
because of all the oppression you had as
someone of color well you always feel
like I have to do something so the
future can get better I think what
occurred to me with the second
conversation is that's the conversation
we need to be having second conversation
I definitely did more listening than
talking I think it's really important
coming from a white male perspective to
be doing more listening to talking I
didn't feel as awkward as I thought I
would in a second conversation I almost
felt better I could actually hear
everyone else's viewpoints and
understand from the other side the
issues coming from a place someone who
hasn't had a lot of conversations about
race I think it was natural to be a
little like nervous but the conversation
was great I think they were really
understanding with the fact that I grew
up a certain way I felt like what I had
to offer was accepted by others I think
knowing now that people of different
races care about my white you know
opinion I feel like I can be in other
conversations I feel like this was the
first step to actually being a part of
this big conversation it can't just be a
conversation within people of color
there needs to be white people in the
conversation I appreciated the fact that
Josh and Lindsay were part of the
conversation I learned some really
eye-opening things now that I've just
kind of dipped my toes in this candid
conversation about race it's totally
something I'd be interested in taking
part in again I don't feel as scared I
feel like I can't connect to people that
aren't like me it's just important to
come together and be a part of that
conversation listen have empathy try to
find a way how you can try to change
them from your personal component even
yes pretty much it don't be scared step
forward and just talk that's the first
step</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
