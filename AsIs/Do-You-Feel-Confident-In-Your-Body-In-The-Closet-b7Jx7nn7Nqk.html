that's how I imagine dudes talking yeah
that's what the inside of Curly's head
so I know hello everybody welcome in the
closet I'm Jen that's Nikki we bring
people into this closet and they leave
probably with some thigh sweat because
it's tight in here and our thighs are
gonna be touching today we're talking
about body image and to do that I've
invited my good friend curly to come to
the closet right about now really come
in crow get in you're gonna get in here
we're gonna have to get tight so our
thighs will touch hey baby
hello thank you for having me thank you
thank you for me this is so nice
my name is curly I my pronouns are
he/him okay cool yeah Yeti nice so today
we're going to talk about body image
which is a very big topic so we're gonna
try and tackle it as best we can and
it's something that everybody can relate
to you know like no matter where you
come from no matter like what you
identify as like your body is kind of
like the way that you like are
represented in the world right it's the
way that people see you and they meet
you like they judge you like they make
you're not blinking how like do you
think your sexuality has shaped the way
you view your body being a gay man like
we kind of have to fit certain
stereotypes like whether we're like
super skinny or we have a lot of muscles
or even if you're chubby I'm like a bear
or hairy like and if we don't we're kind
of like where do I go I might have
to say poop yeah say whatever yeah like
when you were younger or even now like
how do they influence the way you see
yourself
I feel like in the gay community as far
as like men go you get kind of lost as
you think okay if I'm a gay man I know
other gay men like biceps right so you
want to give bigger arms and then you're
like okay they also like asses like I
need to get a bigger ass you want to
feel loved and accepted so you kind of
fall into that kind of a category you
know if you're young and like queer or
if you're questioning your sexuality or
your gender you're going to look at like
the communities around you and
like okay well if these are the people
that are accept me like I have to fit in
because you already know that you're
going to fit into like so crazy you have
to fit in with my shirt yeah so like do
you feel like when you're dating someone
you might compare your body to theirs
yeah I feel like it's different than a
heterosexual relationship because like
if you're a skinny dude dating a chubby
girl you're like she's a thick woman
she's beautiful she's gonna have me in
different places she has a different
body vice versa too but when you have
the same body it kind of is like I don't
have fat in that area I don't know why
you do hard not to be like Oh should I
measure up are we equal yeah and like
dick size you know you're like I don't
have that cuz I get a lot of questions
about like how do you stay so confident
for me and I think that to find your
confidence as far as what body you're
working with you kind of need to work
with what you got right so I know I got
bomb-ass legs so I wear like skinny
jeans and I wear like my little short
yeah I know then boom bang it that's why
I like clothes so much because you get
to cover up certain things and you get
to be confident and it makes it seem
like you you've really filled up all the
spaces and confidence with a really cool
shirt with embroidery on the sides
really and I I'm gonna tweet hopefully
people are fast on the tweeters today oh
we're live tweeting yeah I just tweeted
ask us anything right now which I um I
hope they ask fun things can you yodel
Jen you try I also like cannot rule my
arse so it's like whenever people ask me
to do anything with my mouth I'm just
well oh can we do this one that's the
one that I was looking for uh was the
gays ask bisexuals video scripted there
was a lot of conflicting comments about
it so that video we were asked to ask
bisexuals questions and I have a
relationship with Jordan Kenney where I
tease them all the time and they do the
same we just were all friends right
I also was thinking wow what are some of
the dumbest questions that they probably
get all the time yeah and then I have to
look at it just like a backfire because
I was like no they weren't me asking
them it's like okay how can we get these
dumb questions out of the way I feel
like part of the thing is like there
isn't that much LGBT content like in the
media so part of it is like when stuff
is made people look at like oh
like my Hovis comes out right or it's
like people get really hurt
understandably when it seems like oh my
god yeah that's why I was like oh no
like yeah little babies like I'm here
for you always we like are trying to
make stuff that like speaks to like a
community that isn't represented well
definitely like call us out talk to us
if we up like we want to hear from
you everybody in this space like cares a
lot yeah about you yeah and we want to
do the best we can for you so we're
gonna go out of the closet now butter
thank you for coming we're ready for the
world big world out come okay let's bone
it doesn't matter
and everyone else let's go wait hello we
crawling you out yeah let's leave side
dork bye get a shot of my lesbian boots
