complete I'm going to be either racist
or not racist in five minutes if someone
asks you what you thought about a
particular group of people you could
probably answer them right most of us
believe that we understand our own
brains we believe that we know how we
see the world but what if our brains
were holding on to a whole other set of
subconscious opinions opinions that were
just under the surface that we didn't
even know we had
psychologists call these implicit
attitudes implicit attitudes are defined
as positive and negative evaluations
that occur outside of our conscious
awareness and control the media our
friends everyone we meet our brain pays
attention to all the subtle messages in
our life and tries to make sense of it
all creating our implicit attitudes in
order to measure these subconscious
attitudes psychologists created the
implicit association test or IAT
the test has been taken online by over
two million people we asked six people
to take the IAT about race for the very
first time I am actually pretty excited
about taking this test I have no doubts
that I have some sort of racist
tendencies like everybody else on the
planet I'm afraid of where I grew up
that it's going to reflect on the test
even though I don't want it to I don't
think I'm racist but this test might
tell me that I am I'd like to know who
so I can
I don't know change my ways hmm okay
they're just presenting me with small
amounts of faces and asking me to
identify if they're basically white or
black people dangerous this is racial
profiling I'm mostly looking at the
noses test feels a little weird it's
making me uncomfortable top already it's
weird because there's like the words are
also associated with the pictures
European is also on side of that right
now
the left side is African American or bad
the right side is European American or
good I feel like it's trying to trick my
mind into thinking that these words are
associated with these faces I feel like
I'm getting Incept 'add
so weird oh I get a lot wrong this is
this is mind games ah can feel my
heartbeat going faster and faster and
faster I don't know why I have to think
so hard to do this oh I'm getting really
angry this is exactly what society tells
you it's making you very upset
huh got my results your automatic
preference may be described as slight
moderate strong or little to no
preference your data suggests slight
automatic preference for African
American compared to European American
your data suggests a strong automatic
preference for European American
compared to African American your data
suggests a slight automatic preference
for African American compared to
European American your data suggests a
slight automatic preference for European
American compared to African American
your data suggests a moderate automatic
preference for African American compared
to European American your data suggests
a slight automatic preference for
European American compared to African
American I thought I was gonna be like
neutral maybe I'm not surprised by the
results but I'm also not happy with them
I'm African American
all my friends or majority African
American my parents are African
Americans so I find my preferences what
I've seen almost every single day of my
life for me figuring out where my
sympathies live really are is so
complicated even in like kindergarten or
elementary school like white is like
like heavenly and like angels black is
always like associated with like coal or
like darkness so I'm not surprised that
that's an automatic response because
we've been so conditioned to think that
way
even if you do have a strong preference
for one of the other it makes no
difference if you go through your life
like open-hearted and open-minded and
just sensitive to other people
and I don't know I'm pretty emotional it
opens up dialogue that definitely needs
to happen now even if you don't deal
with race in your life a lot of people
do it's good to be asked why don't you
feel as comfortable and maybe we can
change that don't be scared of race it's
like it's there everybody should be
talking about it you know you don't have
to be angry and you don't have to be
upset and we don't have to talk about
like who's got power over who like it's
time
