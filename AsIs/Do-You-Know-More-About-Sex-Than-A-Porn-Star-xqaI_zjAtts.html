good in school but I was good at um sex
questions sex got you I think I will do
well I think I know enough about sex
like you know what I mean I'm an adult
and I've been to enough classes in
school I'm not good at tests I'm not
really good at tests I'm fairly
confident in my ability that I answer
questions about sex
well I don't have sperm so I don't know
you better get this one right I probably
get this wrong but
so they just can keep dishing it out
it's not like you're gonna run dry like
your dicks like
it's this acrobatic or right before you
go to sleep romantic or athletic yeah I
guess it depends on the kind of set to
having as well right
we answer the correct one three to five
calories now
I just took a wild guess you don't have
like a heart monitor
whoo that's like a question Wow I think
I'm pretty sure that they like correlate
but not always at the same time
biologically I think they're separate
love you have to have DePass emotional
all that connections I've definitely
 people I didn't love and had a
great time if you put your mind in the
right place right when you have orgasm
no matter what guy or girl you always
are contracting I have seen it happen
with my very own eyes
like the thing that you're holding with
your hands and you like lift your legs
up like this over and over so like if
you were doing sit-ups you could come hi
probably hypothetically go I feel like I
heard your burger and I feel like we
have the same answer Energy's pretty big
I just like to think that sex is good
for you I totally agree with it there we
go one percent sometimes we'll say like
if you're having a panic attack you
should start having sex and I just
learned that sex can cure hangovers as
long as it's consensual it's the best
thing in the world I feel really good
with my knowledge of sex I'm surprised
that I actually got a lot of those right
I think the more you know about
something the more you can positively
incorporate it into your life
