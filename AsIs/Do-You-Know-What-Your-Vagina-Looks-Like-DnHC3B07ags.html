I'm Rosa I'm Ashley my name is Jamie and
I am what are we doing here today I'm
gonna have a really intense look at my
vagina I am going to show you what my
vagina looks like with my words oh and
someone else is gonna draw and get a
little portrait of it I'm going to pick
out my vagina from like a lineup of
different vaginas and pick which one's
mine it feels embarrassing and weird
kind of just like myself out for this
because it's like okay it's awkward but
like there's no shame in having a vagina
feeling curious this is fun I'm excited
to see the results
I'm Caroline I'm a professional portrait
artist I've been drawing for eight years
now and I've never drawn vagina
portraits but I'm confident I can do it
hi there hi nice to meet you have you
ever had your portrait drawn before not
of my you will be describing what
you're seeing and I will be drawing
exactly what you tell me okay and I use
this mirror here and stuff all right
Oh yep Ben well like weird yeah and it's
just it's there describe the lips mole
they're very even darker than any skin
on my body maybe like two string cheese
like okay that's good is that good like
that okay I'm going to go ahead and get
a rough sketch going okay and we'll move
into detail well it kind of looks like
an iris like the flower okay oh my gosh
it's like it's like a pistachio a very
healthy raisin maybe have you ever had a
dried peach yes it looks like that all
right and can you describe the top part
the hood the hood of my vagina okay like
um a smaller version of like the rocket
pops from the top it kind of like comes
down like a why so it's like skinny at
the top and it widens when I'm walking
around you kits not you don't see the
fun inside stuff I don't think I've ever
seen anything look like it never looked
at my vagina for so long I feel
embarrassed that I don't know as much
about myself as I feel like I should I
hope it looks pretty like eyes like
Georgia O'Keeffe I feel really good
about it
ah this is cool
whoa they're all unique that is pretty
that's not mine
but I like that one I have no idea what
trying to mine this would maybe look
more like mine
but these three looks so similar from
what I described I can eliminate these
three because these people get waxing
apparently they all look so different I
think this one's mine yes I did it first
go I think it's this one
yes the way I described it fits this one
most I would say that one is mine it's
me this one Ashley I'm just gonna pick
that one that's weird that is me I think
this one's mine
it's Jamie um this yep oh my god it's
gonna be like the last one that I choose
that's mine I don't think I gave enough
detail I did a good job describing it I
used words that other people knew it's
weird when you see things you've never
seen before I learned a lot about myself
for sure it was an uncomfortable but
enlightening experience it's like okay
so maybe it's not as intimidating do you
feel like every female should have
experience you should know your body
better than anybody else</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
