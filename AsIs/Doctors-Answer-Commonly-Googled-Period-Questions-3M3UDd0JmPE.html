a little bit more and be a little bit
more friendly during that time of the
month so you'll have a little bit more
love I'm dr. Lisa Masterson and I'm an
ob/gyn and I practice in Santa Monica my
name is dr. alida thefn and I'm a
Reproductive Endocrinology and
infertility specialist today I'm gonna
be talking about googled questions on
your period bring it on well it could be
a lot of reasons for your period being
irregular it could be a fibroid it could
be an infection it could be a disorder
one of the most common reasons is due to
ovulation disorders you have to remember
your period is a vital sign pick it's
irregular and goes off the wall go to
your doctor especially towards the end
of the period the blood is older rather
than fresh takes a long time to get from
the uterus into the vagina and then out
for you to see it so it also gets
oxidized and so it gets started it's not
actually your period but the hormonal
changes that go on with your period what
typically happens is when ovulation
occurs and a hormone called progesterone
is made can affect how fast food can go
through the gastrointestinal tract so
yes it can affect bowel changes it's a
terrible question but believe it or not
not directly in certain disorders such
as when a women has lots of uterine
fibroids if you have a heavy period you
know like one of those crime-scene pairs
you can lose so much blood in a mount of
time that yes it can cause you to lose
your life and then you need an emergency
dnc it sounds so awful but we scrape
that lining and then that stops the
bleeding and it can save women's lives
well B V stands for bacterial vaginosis
but basically it's not going to help it
it may actually bring the smell out
periods would not be expected to help
the situation with VV
well cats can certainly smell the odor
of a period hopefully they'll just
nuzzle up to you a little bit more and
be a little bit more friendly however I
would not expect that a cat would be
affected by the period itself so
sometimes you can have really severe
cramped very significant pain during the
periods can be caused by a number of
disease processes that's usually because
of something called prostaglandins and
they cause the uterus to cramp let me
tell you having had a baby they are not
as bad as labor cramps even though they
may seem like it your period cramps may
make you vomit because of the estrogen
hormones that are going on around right
before the period and during the period
the hormones are shifting and that can
cause some nausea so it's really
important to talk to your doctor because
we can help you with that sometimes by
balancing them out with birth control
pills remember that not just for
contraception they actually act as
hormones to balance those hormones
during a period well they can but
they're not going to stay that way it's
a temporary augmentation when
progesterone hormone is produced that
actually can induce slight growth and
also you're gonna be retaining water and
that also makes your breasts appear
larger it can absolutely stimulate those
taste buds because of the hormone shifts
that are occurring before and during the
period there's a lot of women's will
have total cravings again so if you're
one that chocolate and dull djal it'll
but if that's what makes you feel good
this can occur if there are things that
we're eating that can affect the vaginal
secretions and give it a more sweet odor
then unless you have diabetes or
something like that then you might again
want to talk to your doctor about it
oh the parrot can make you tired because
of those hormones again that
premenstrual syndrome everybody loves
that period nap you go into like
coma-like sleep because of the blood
loss that happens during the period we
can be more prone to being tired again
the hormonal changes that are going on
if it's keeping you from doing your work
then that's something you need to talk
to your doctor about the vagina is a
self-cleaning oven so it should not have
an odor to it can certainly occur if
there is bacterial vaginosis type of
infection going on that whiff test it
smells fishy not good you need something
to help that so if there is a fishy odor
it should be evaluated well if your
period smells like bleach it's not
because it's cleaner sperm tends to
smell like bleach the bleach is a sign
of ammonia or you may have eaten a lot
more nitrogen rich food so you may want
to change up your diet a little bit also
if they're feminine product use that
contain chlorine so those are the type
of things that can make it cause a
little bit of an ammonia type of smell
your period can be a great thing as the
science you're becoming a woman you can
have a baby it's important to know that
periods can literally come in different
shapes and sizes if I talk to your
doctor use them as a resource we're here
to help you if there is something that
you're concerned about it's really
important to talk to your physician and
get it evaluated really make the most of
being a wonderful hormonal woman</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
