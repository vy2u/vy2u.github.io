sunscreen
I'm dr. Gina Strom I specialize in hair
and scalp disorders acne and skin of
color my name is Lindsay Borden I
specialize in patch testing for
allergies of the skin and also hair loss
I'm Strom lota mostly I do
bread-and-butter dermatology so
cosmetics to Pediatrics acne psoriasis
eczema today I'm going to be answering
some of the most googled questions about
skin care so let's do it they're
actually not anything that you apply for
a short amount of time and then take off
doesn't alter your skin all that much
many times a face mask just hydrates
your skin temporarily if you have acne
prone skin they can cause a lot of
problems it will give the illusion of
toning your skin because it dries it and
that makes it feel more tight they might
contain salicylic acid or glycolic acid
or other things but generally they're
not needed
no I wish it did I get this question all
the time it's actually used when someone
has a drug overdose but putting it on
your skin really won't do anything
serums carry the anti-aging product or
the acne product so it all depends on
what's in your serum so serums tend to
be more oil-based you have to be careful
though because they can also cog your
pores and cause acne feels great putting
cucumbers on your eyes just cools your
eyes a lot of times people will use tea
bags that have been in the refrigerator
and it can help as like a cool compress
on your eyes a lot of these skin care
products are owned by the same company
the Korean skincare lines are the same
things that are offered in the US it's
just under different branding
yes and no it depends on the type of
light therapy and who's administering it
you want to definitely go to a
board-certified dermatologist
this is actually near and dear to my
heart because I do a lot of patch
testing for allergies a lot of the
all-natural skincare lines have a lot of
botannical does that mean that they have
something plant-based in it but it still
may have the same preservatives you have
to really think about what you're
specifically concerned about maybe
absolutely age of 21 think about good
sunscreens you know for aging but before
then you should still be using sunscreen
you know that prevents skin cancer but
it's never too early to start a skin
care routine and your routine can be
very very simple it's best to wash your
face once a day at least at the end of
the day just to get the dirt and grime
off I'd say gentle exfoliation is fine
if you like that but I wouldn't
aim to make it part of your daily
routine you have to remember you don't
want to over exfoliate because that will
dry your skin and actually damage your
skin you want to use a more mild soap or
cleanser something like Cetaphil
cleanser is very good it doesn't have
any detergents in it
people with sensitive skin should use a
very gentle cleanser and then apply a
moisturizer shortly after you want to
stick to products that are not having
fragrance their pigments dyes you often
want to stick with things that are meant
for babies for oily skin you can use
things that are a little bit more
aggressive like a benzoyl peroxide wash
or a salicylic acid wash to help get the
oil off use very thin type moisturizer
so lotions rather than creams most
people the mistake that they make with
acne prone skin is they wash their skin
all the time how you should treat your
skin will depend on whether or not
you're under treatment if you're using
medications or not go see your
dermatologist still figuring out if your
parents have bad cystic acne you're
gonna be more prone to it it's a
combination of the hair follicles
essentially being constipated and there
may be you know some issue with the
types of bacteria that live on the skin
there's so many solutions so many things
that we can give to patients now no one
should be suffering with that me
cystic acne is basically when you have
acne lesions that are deep in the skin
it can't drain and it ruptures the poor
man's solution is taking Afrin nasal
spray you could squirt it in your hands
and you could pat it on your cheeks and
it constricts the blood vessels a little
bit it's not a good long-term solution
and you don't want to do it frequently
because your skin will get used to it
and then you'll get rebound redness when
you're not using it a blackhead is when
one of those pores gets blocked right
and then your oil gland is pumping and
it's pumping it's pumping it's exposed
to the air it gets oxidized turns black
and that's a blackhead you can't really
change the size of them but you can
change the appearance of them and you
can do that by keeping them clear
keeping your face clean
there is pore minimizing primer out
there so if you want to look like you
have smaller pores you know use the
primer but it doesn't have any
long-lasting effect as a board-certified
dermatologist I would say to let your
dermatologist drain it but if you have a
pimple that's coming to a head at home
you know a hot shower it comes to a head
and just by gently touching it it will
come out stay out of the Sun and don't
smoke the number one two three four five
six seven on the list is to use good
sunscreen
generally speaking the best sunscreens
have zinc
this is actually semantics in some way a
Sun SPOT okay is what we call Lent ago
and then moles are we call Nev I and Nev
I can be acquired or are you just born
with them and then sunspots you acquire
with sun exposure so freckles is what we
call f validities freckles you kind of
get more with sun exposure just like you
do with sunspots they're essentially the
same thing well the answer to that will
depend on your personal health history
if you have a personal history of skin
cancer then you should see a
dermatologist more often generally
speaking for the whole population just
once a year even if you're young you
should be seeing your dermatologist at
least get an education about what you
should be doing I would recommend other
than lipstick or maybe mascara that you
take your makeup off before you work out
it's not preferable for short it can
cause inflammation and it may actually
aid your skin if you're using things
that are very harsh that cause redness
or irritation for your skin just to
remove your makeup that's not good
especially around your eyelids
I don't like waterproof makeups they're
very harsh and tough to remove if you
have no problems with that in terms of
your skin and using those things feel
free to do those things just be careful
with removing them generally speaking
it's fine to wear makeup if you're
pregnant but if you're concerned about
particular ingredients make sure
whatever you're doing is okay by your OB
the skin does a lot more than we think
it's not just for vanity it's what
protects us it's a sign of your overall
health take care of what takes care of
you and protect what protects you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
