the nicest way possible I would like you
guys to arrange yourself from Lois p.m.
I know all right get over eight I can do
this real fast guys usually I forgot a
brightly lower yeah okay honestly I
think someone would be higher Oh taller
people yeah i mean i'm also wearing
heels but i am like i feeling geared
towards the end numbers okay 510 okay
okay let's see it yes you are all the
same
what are BMI oh that's crazy so say I'm
like 175 pounds of like I'm pretty lean
but if someone else is my height and 175
pounds of mostly fat we have the same
body mass index right so it doesn't know
like what's bad and what's much do you
guys think that II might an accurate way
of determining health definitely no no
no it feels really unfair to say that
definitely like that's be and I are the
same health level when like you eat back
then you run marathons and I don't know
eat cheeseburgers like there's no way
that that number can be so definitively
there's also so many other factors of
just like there are people who are
naturally skinny who don't exercise and
have poor heart health like there's so
many factors that go into health in
general like yeah you putting into your
body
how much do you exercise your heart I
don't trust that number at all like can
I run on like 5 miles yes do I eat
healthy yes that's what matters to me I
think for a person that's like maybe
like lower income or maybe doesn't go to
the gym very often like you can
determine if you're at risk for certain
things just quickly these numbers are a
good beginning point because if you
really are very far off the scale there
is a chance that you should consider
something else in your life but down to
the minutia it really is just about like
how do you feel in your body you can do
it at your computer it's not going to
show you if you're actually healthy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
