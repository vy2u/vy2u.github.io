helping him like throwing up and then he
was having a lot of hard time yeah
that's not embarrassing you've always
been like this mysterious guy yeah like
he never talks about himself so like do
you talk about
so we've been dating for two and a half
years now I think I will win because
there are a lot of stuff that you don't
actually share with your best friend but
then with your girlfriend or boyfriend
right we're doing each other for like a
little over ten years now right we've
had a couple sleepovers and passed a lot
of cameras not anymore it's not a boy at
boys night out yes we're because the
most answer is correct
we'll have a romantic date with me I'll
be really disappointed if you guys don't
get stuff right I'm scared
oh yeah it's true - that's not a bad
habit go oh you know that and I know it
the movie starting at 8:00 and he comes
to my place to pick me up at like eight
or a ten
Marshalls lucky calm down always nice
the first couple minutes a couple
minutes up and I eat it hates it oh my
gosh a couple minutes ago yeah just
out there I lost my back and there's our
 I was just saying
yes one on our Europe backpacking trip
together out of all the places that we
decide to go and visit you wanted to
stay here the longest the reason is
because they have that what chicken
restaurant Oh Nando's Antelope Canyon we
could visit there like it's not
something yeah no that's not a special
it's London is like I'm pissed now okay
oh yeah my diversion since it's an open
water that's right don't get it wrong
cuz I love swimming swimming is my thing
but I need to see my feet yeah I see the
ground your hand doesn't count he's the
responsible one like when we were
drinking I just drink whatever but then
he gets drunk but then he's still he's
still responsible for like his friends
I drink responsibly I disagree you
disagree yeah you always target certain
people we wouldn't eat our drink till
their drop make sure you guys are having
fun
on this point I mean I think we
definitely talk more about these kind of
stuff Jews don't really talk about deep
stuff like this anymore like basic
questions there they were pretty deep
you never had to really think about them
it actually got to know about you a lot
more today than I've known you for 10
years and I'm really impressed that
Claire got a lot of these questions
right so we are here at a restaurant
Claire what are we eating here this is
live optimist she's sorry</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
