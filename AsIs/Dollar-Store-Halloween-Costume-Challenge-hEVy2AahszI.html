procrastinate until you have a 30-minute
lunch break to figure out your costume

creative stylish people I know jazz and
sissy to go to the Dollar Tree with 20
bucks and 30 minutes to try to put
together the most creative costume they
possibly can are you guys up for it you
guys have 30 minutes go being a turtle
pretty yeah I want to be something
pretty this is stressful I'm looking for
a bag big enough that I can fit inside
because then I can cut the bottoms off
and make shorts I thought this store
would at least have some like shirts
some like $1 shirts whatever they don't
so worst feels worse I have a tablecloth
and some cat ears I'll be a cat I'm a
cute cat I'm naturally a cat that's my
backup plan x halfway over

media's for Halloween and not enough
time
decided to ditch my cat outfit and
decided that I'm gonna be a gif
I'm gonna be a present I'm gonna be a
celebration you know I'm here to party
and I want to make sure that that's
clear to everybody into a basic pumpkin
spice I don't think I'm gonna win but I
think I would get laid at the end of the
night I'm checking out right now and I
feel like I'm a little over 20 bucks
the price of fashion I'm hoping that
this cylinder
I'm not mad at this so I took the gift
wrapping tissue and I stuffed it in my
bra just to give myself a little bit
extra whip cream

their costumes for like 20 minutes
so I'm gonna go check on them so cute

really like pumpkin so yeah I think I'm
gonna go with jazz I just I think what
I've seen the present thing before but
this is a way that I haven't seen it I
like heavy you don't know what it is the
first thing you do spin and then it's
like boom now you just give this so like
detailed thoughts go into it and she's
like Cup it's out and like pull on the
back of the straw do I have to choose oh
