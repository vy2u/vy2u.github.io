that once I was at my friend's house and
they really wanted to put me in full
face of makeup and I was like go for it
I came out in seventh grade I came out
as bisexual I was still really afraid of
what people would think two years ago I
came out as gay because I was like I
think it's finally time that I be true
to myself and have everyone else know my
full story so how I got into drag was I
would find myself going to the Sephora
and I would go pick up some
and my friends were like you know I've
seen that you were doing makeup you
should try to do a like Kris Jenner
impersonation and out of nowhere I kind
of just started to do drag if you're
just like playing around with makeup and
like Jordan if you're ever like I'm born
on a Saturday night put on some makeup
and try new things that's the most fun
part about makeup it's like never wrong

the thing that you're looking forward to
