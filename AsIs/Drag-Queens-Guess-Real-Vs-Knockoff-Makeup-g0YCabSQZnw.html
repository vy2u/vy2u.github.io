hi everyone my name is Gilda rabbit hi
I'm Jan spoor this is your geology
Fratelli and today I have the challenge
of guessing which makeup is a brand name
and which is a goth
I'm a very superficial person and I'm a
makeup snob and Praeger get this right I
watch a lot of makeup videos on YouTube
so I'm hoping that I score pretty high
in this today bring it home
oh my god these are very very similar
that is definitely a Urban Decay brush
the packaging is heavier the names alone
give way Coco bronze honey
golden girl by man y'all are making this
really hard up on a sniff the naked
palettes are known for having really
good brushes and this brush is lit this
brush has a sponge applicator and that
says drugstore that gave it away
No oh my god no I don't even know these
are so shimmery over here this knockoff
is really good this is a real yeah I'm
gonna have to say that this one is the
real one No get out here oh my god
because they have so many naked palettes
this is the name brand play I don't even
know ah both packages feel really nice
they're both heavy and this one no I
mean size packaging no I can't even say
it this one is like the blush and I
don't know if I know Satya's has grown
to the blush oh it's so creamy what I've
never used these I really excited - ah
 charges so much there's gotta be a
lot of product in there well maybe I
should like look at the colors and like
see they are literally exactly the same
it's so cute it's like very creamy but
this one is like butter Paula Deen would
love this and then this blush is it a
cute blush let's find out it is a cute
plush so I'm gonna say this is the high
end neon yellow
and this is the knockoff no this is
honest awesome yeah cuz the glass this
one is the real one yeah okay two for
two
Kat Von D's liquid lipsticks first of
all amazing brand her eyeliner is like
life these two things are exactly
similar wow this is a knockoff like it
feels the same it looks almost the same
mmm this one suspicious this color is
everything look at it gorgeous but this
one if this isn't it oh crap I'm gonna
die this one is very very smooth with
this one's like watery and wet I want to
see if they can like dry down so I can
test which one transfers or not this
one's great she's staying
she's also staying though Kat Von D I
got it wrong damn it I figured because
this one was scented it smelt like Kate
but this packaging feels cheaper is neon
pink a name-brand
okay I got that one right I'm gonna say
that this is the real one this is the
big one yeah we're thinking fast ladies
and gentlemen
but I know I'm gonna get the rug this
one's like light and this one's a little
bit heavier and I know Kylie's packaging
tends to be pretty good essence kind of
smells like nachos ah this smells good
like the cupcakes just for funsies we're
gonna swatch that sound as erotic this
one's pretty and it smells nice
it smells like rose it's gorgeous
if I take a spoon tightly are you
serious
I figured cuz a package to give this one
looks cuter I'm gonna say that this is
the kylie one are you kidding me and it
smells like nacho is a neon pink is the
actual Kylie lip kit and the onion is a
knockoff
is that true nailed it perfect
I love this great job Kylie I am shocked
at how I did I don't have any timing mix
I feel ashamed embarrassed letdown I
feel like I'm letting all of you down I
actually think I did really well cuz I
did I thought I was gonna do I also
really want to try the category love kit
new
only a day go by I am not as much of a
snob but if you thought I was
I'm sure I love this now I'm gonna go
spend money on me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
