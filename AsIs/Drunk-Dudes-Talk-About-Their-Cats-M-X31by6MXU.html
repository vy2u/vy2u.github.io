question what was the question I'm drunk
and I love cats what more do you need to
know
I am half a cat away from being a crazy
cat lady I'm pretty sure my first word
was kitty I can't even take care of
myself
for example cats can do that cats get a
bad rap there's a lot of shitty cats out
there it pisses me off when people say
that cats are shitty cause it's like no
if you have a shitty cat it's because
you're a shitty person that's your
science it's like heaven it's like you
wake up and there's this like
six kittens just hunting you and purring
and curling up and just all sorts of
weird here's what I like about Simon
Simon has cross eyes across blue eyes
even though he's very dumb he's as dumb
as cats get he also has like a quiet
dumb dignity he's like Forrest Gump of
cats look at him until his fluffy ass
belly there's teeth you guys
I'll have the thought that I miss Ellie
and then immediately have the thought
that I should text her and then
immediately have a thought remembering
that like cats can't text she lives in
New York I live in California I love my
cat so much and I miss him so much
he's terrifying the most people but he's
adorable to me he's a warrior
he got hit by car twice he think you
know Baja when they piss all over this
 sofa
mama forty shits in the tub she's also
the most aggressive cat that I've ever
met
just stop in the tub hoodie my
cat my casa dickhead that's the thing my
cat's a dick but he's like my dick
well first off I'd be like I knew it
 I'd be like yo Simon I was a
really awkward teenager right and he'd
be like I would dummy I don't know
what's happening anywhere what do you
want to do with your life give me life
goal cat's pretend like they don't know
what you're saying they're really smart
like when I say to my cat's I'm like
dude let's go inside and have a shot and
they're like whatever I'm gonna go take
a poop and dig a hole why do you watch
me on the toilet it's really
embarrassing but like seriously they
just watch me to get and it's so
awkward I've said I love you to my cat
more than I've said to any person I I
kissed my cat a lot I'm a little that
like shows a deficiency in my life I'm
really drunk I can't say again I
can't I can't play a goddamn thing
don't lick your sister's butt that's
weird</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
