metaphor for life because you just you
just got a try you keep trying sometimes
you fail sometimes you run over the
lines but then there's that time where
you get it perfect and then you die you
ever painted your nose before here yeah
really yeah I know I was in high school
I used to I'm like middle school was
like a god slash I've never painted my
nails but I grew up with an older sister
she was really into SWV they had really
long nails that like curves and stuff I
went for a manicure with my girl and
she's like you want clear Co I'm like
hell yeah want clear coat I'll do yours
and then you do mine and we'll go back
over with some sparkles okay I'm looking
at this and like it kind of fits with
your like personality I'm not a drink
Tris Cheers do not mess up my nails bro
wait wait uh what nos ah yeah it's a lot
harder than it looks and then you have a
really small thinking just like
enjoyable for girls cuz right now I'm
pretty stressed all right this is easy
right
I like do it by themselves like when you
seem in the movies I usually like on the
phone with their girl always doing a
four-way call knew what people talk
about when they get their nails done hi
man tell me a little bit about your date
bro your hands are hairy
yeah I don't know what feels very
intimate it does it's nice
oh this is some gnarly
all this you hmm oh this is gonna be
subtle but fabulous this is good rich
doing the reader job dangle some nice
drunks yo your fingernails are nice
tonight
thanks you look like that's how you
identify great artists yeah by the
brushstroke no you identified great
artists but their confidence will solo
noon yeah you did well man
except for that worm Oh take it easy
Michelangelo you need a touch of oh all
right I'll touch up I don't know if I'm
like actually drunk if I'm just high off

if I had a dick date tonight
Yeah right think we doing it no
how pretty you are
I'm so pretty I don't know this is like
a chunk missing but you know you did a
good job you to learn I mean for the
most part part of me feels like really
pretty the other part of me feels like a
four you'll dig my nails you did a
job here being intoxicated made it
easier for me to just lean in and just
you know go to work yeah
yeah I don't think it helped with the
coordination Loki I mean I can get why
this makes you feel real pretty and like
I was so like how does this fit we just
poison out all the fumes
I don't feel pretty at all I feel like I
still need to but you know just like in
life there's parts that I'm proud of in
parts that I'm not proud of but like the
past you can't change it this is
changing it was definitely a bonding
experience it was different I know I
feel like I know a little more about
rich and I feel closer to him I'd say
this is one of the more intimate moments
I've had with a man somewhat a large
woman with the hair the man in the
office yeah definitely I feel like it's
more about conversation than the actual
nails mm-hmm hey Aaron else as a Hannah
Montana said nobody's perfect she's if
she said she did she's got to work it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
