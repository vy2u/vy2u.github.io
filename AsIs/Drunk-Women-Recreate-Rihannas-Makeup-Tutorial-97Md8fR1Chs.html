smile I'm gonna smile okay if me and
Rihanna were in the same room I would
leave that room because I don't deserve
to be around her her beauty stuff is
amazing and it's just like cool just
like watch her like do everything I'm
like she's like completely grown into
like a woman I'm kind of going into it
like I will never on my best day look as
good as Rihanna we're not going with my
crown I never so I'm just like I
probably won't do good but I think
Rihanna would accept me either way my
hands are shaking I'm so nervous I just
want to make my mom proud you know I
don't do makeup tutorials like ever but
um I've done makeup drunk and I'm pretty
good the thing that's cool about being
drunk and doing your makeup is like you
just feel good no matter what I like
what Rihanna said in the video about how
your concealer just conceals all yours
did she see your sins I was like that is
exactly what we are doing today because
this is a hard sin for me today she is
my dear here we go
it's real okay I'm doubly getting gunned
down and it's hot in here so now that
we're good and drunk we're going to
start this tutorial she goes when she
does hurry on a week
look how magnetic these are dude why did
she do that that's very clear she knew
your children and that we wanted to
connect things like this why she is
careful here we go
are you ready yeah I think that was a
that was the winner that was the winner
okay so we're ready I just want to sit
again all set so if the thing where is
she she's two sinks get your foundation
she did three she didn't pause to know
what you how long does must one beat
their face before they've come to self
actualization of this mad make a parade
put this shit back in there oh shit
drying some inches out on there oh I
think I went a little too hard I did a
nose contour which is you did it
did you dick
she uses a brush to blend yeah I'm just
gonna use my experience way Beauty
Blender you want to try that triangle
with the foundation oh I looks like good
egg oh my gosh my long is now my long is
now back my neck is now long thanks
Ariana this is my favorite step it's
called Matt oh you're right though she
has concealer first you know our
beautiful producer has reminded me that
I'm a drunk drunk girl so it's kind of
like she's baking but like lightly
baking I think so at least I don't know
a little drunk right now it's a hundred
and thousand degrees in here so I'm very
more you right beautiful
I don't know whatever also I can tell um
I'm not drunk or if like the blending
process
maybe my skin is so hot that the process
is going faster we are drunk it has
taken us about 20 minutes to get through
three steps of this makeup tutorial we
are drunk right see the thing is I don't
have like a lot of hair on my brow line
and it's just like they're all just
scraggly and growing in their own
direction my brows are a band and
everyone wants to go so one I'm like not
all of you can be Justin I can't tell if
I look amazing or if I'm gonna look
crazy at the end of this yet so which
Rihanna are you right now I'm fat round
and teasing dream I feel like I'm pon de
replay Rihanna just like breaking into
the industry and try to figure shit out
I'm actually sure okay sound good thank
you
of course because I just like it gives
me show you bright like a diamond
okay pink on the leg hang on the lid
let's be pink on the lids Beach please
we bout to highlight the fuck out of
this I think there's like honest did I
do the nose contour
you did a bronzer yeah okay
and keep on going whisker everywhere
it's probably cause I'm drunk honestly
what you do it's on your nose
it's okay you can fix it you can fix it
can't get out
whoa I look like a unicorn
yeah oh look at that Wow
I could just keeping this on one more
I'm sorry do it do it do it do it
this is Rihanna as your bitches gonna be
come we didn't know I love good I feel
that I tried my hardest for my look yeah
we really tried around that I wanted to
be as savage as I could for you and I
hope that I got to the level that you
would like to be I think we do makeup
good job yeah I feel like I wouldn't
have done any better if I was sober to
be honest didn't anyone ever tell you
that I was a savage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
