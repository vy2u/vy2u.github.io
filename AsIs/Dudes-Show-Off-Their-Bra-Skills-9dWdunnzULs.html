we're like it's okay that you're kind of
working on taking this raw off but once
you clear that time that's one of the
chronic sets in and I think that that's
when what mistakes are made people get
hurt yeah I've got a bit of experience
for us I've heard of them I'll be doing
it and the girl just like file
it with myself and like take it off you
want a number value I'm gonna buy like a
seven or an eight confident five because
I don't know what I'm doing but
sometimes I get lucky cut myself at like
a nine three I've never worked at the
front classroom oh god that's a tight
that's a taught pot name is fun tonight
what's one okay I don't know who I can
love a relationship go there you go
naked yeah failure you gotta go on with
the two-timer oh oh oh okay so this is
the three class situation back here
this is industrial-strength I'll be rego
we got it oh here we go oh oh here oh
you can see this one right no problem
okay this is how we trust I get so much
trust
got a feel where that middle guy is and
then you got to stay in because yep I
made a mistake but there we go
no of course it Fort Knox of all bras
you guys don't know that's why I'm
making progress so right now I'm using
 to hand there's two ways to do
you can go up in the front or you could
try and grow it either back so I know
I'm gonna stand up stand up and turn
around the cell your lap nope it gets a
little tight ah there we go
okay ha ha yeah you hold them and then
you slide your hands through and they
not all muscle or down like this this is
good oh good oh we met with resistance
we're getting to the sweetmeat what's up
man is there 49 firm grub if you proved
the test I think I understand I think
you overrated yourself maybe I think
that I was as good as I thought I was no

bra with more confidence but also stop
inventing new ways to attach bras I'm
proud of us I'm proud of us too
