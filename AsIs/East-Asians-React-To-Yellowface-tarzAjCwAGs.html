Resta world not like okinawa way the
hell world filled with the night for
variation example my stomach is turning
watching this oh my god my left bad
don't act ins in themselves aren't funny
things like it's somebody trying to
learn a new language is that all it
takes to make yourself look agent just
looks like a white dude doing like a
shitty accent Marlon Brando is also one
of like the greatest American actors and
seeing this you're like no but you're
not watching this feels just really
dehumanizing agonizing Oh wonderful I
must have broke that if you don't stop
it up on the gravel right this minute I
go to clutter-free Department yeah this
is really racist this guy could have
been an orc in Lord of the Rings that's
how much meat if he has on right now
literally a political cartoon the Asian
guy is not human
he's clearly not supposed to be human an
early example of the way human are
portrayed is gross
Oh Audrey Hepburn she's so gorgeous and
graceful and then all of a sudden you
get Mickey Rudi it's like a kick in the
nuts
oh just because they break all the rules
and have everybody at race pen doesn't
mean that it's still okay to do the
yellow faced with this kind of makeup
you don't transcend time you just look
really bad the actors did a great job
but you just cannot make a white man
look Asian
level of discomfort is not like diarrhea
discomfort like before but like more
like you know mild indigestion Asian men
are either portrayed is like dweeby
children or like a scary alien cold monk
can you teach me how to do that
no I retired from teaching long ago hi
and alyson hannigan the problem with
this is the term Orientalism yep it's
not omage anymore when you start playing
someone else's race it just makes me
feel so exotic eyes kind of just reads
we're gonna take a hodgepodge of Asian
influences you could have easily done an
O Maj where you would exist in that
universe of the Far East but you're
still a white character could you have
imagined if How I Met Your Mother
decided to a whole episode where they
did the same thing but it was blackness
we would not have accepted that it's so
tough because I love the show I like
watched it every day for them to do this
like it really it breaks my heart I
think that people confuse interest in
another culture with understanding for
that culture you get to a point where
you're just like I don't expect anything
better from my media than what I've been
given
yellow face you can't get past the damn
makeup I think it's sort of like oh well
the Asians are louder now and they'll
get mad at us if we do straight-up
yellow face there are no Asian bankable
stars because no Asian has been cast in
a role where they've been allowed to
become a bankable star and should not
beyond the actors you should be on the
directors and the casting Hollywood
doesn't have as much an excuse to say I
can't cast an Asian actor because there
are Asian actors I'm sure the people
making these decisions think the media
has gotten better if you ask an Asian
person I think they would tell you a
very different hey do you think the King
has gotten better to be honest yes but
better doesn't mean it's good enough</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
