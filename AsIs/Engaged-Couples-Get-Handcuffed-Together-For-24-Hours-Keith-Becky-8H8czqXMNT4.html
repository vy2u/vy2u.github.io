yeah
Becky and I are going to handcuff
ourselves to one another for 24 hours we
spend a lot of time together we already
live together we're engaged we don't
spend every second together I'm pretty
excited I think it's gonna be fun I
think she's gonna have a rude awakening
we're gonna be a little irritated at
some times oh oh oh honey does that hurt
yes that's why I said oh I think it's
gonna be so easy I think he's upset
because he doesn't like to pee in front
of me but like surprised I've heard him
pee and poop before you're not just
gonna hear it I'm gonna look at it
you're gonna have to really experience
it so we're setting up our bathroom
situations Becky's got a nice book to
get her mind off of a pooping got some
headphones so she doesn't have to listen
to me poop yeah we'll see if we come out
of it stronger yeah I'm not more upset
with one oh no no spiritless out are you
going don't hold your arm weird like a
normal person by when you throw a party
one of the people who owns the place is
the host and the other person socialize
whoa and now I have to wait for people
to show up throw in the party but we
can't walk around a bar
to our new life as an octopus we both
have to come I already forgot I already
forgot this is the thing it's tough to
host a party when you can't separate and
do a good job hosting a party because
you're stuck to each other and you open
the door we also don't typically spend
parties attached at the hip
I don't want to be bad we're very much
our own people at parties and then we
just reconvene to like see what the
others up to pretty good yeah yeah you
can hang out with my friends she
tightened our air cups and sleeping
uncomfortably together and that's gonna
be rough we're going bed gonna handcuffs
oh yeah
shoulder blades look really sexy humble
look at them yeah it's really cause
they're lighting rain it's the lighting
the lighting is really some night should
be a lot of favorites right now yeah
okay we're going to bed good night and
then the next morning when what when
Becky drinks she wake up early breakfast
in bed
he had good breakfast we made together
what ooh difficult gun pretty decent
I'm much easier to make food when you're
not trying to host yeah usually
weekend's we spend together unless I'm
at work in which case I seen Keith stays
at home and just cries and sits by the
door waiting for me to come back the
sink up thing is very easy when you
don't have to do anything and right now
I'm not doing anything the midday
mid-afternoon I was pretty good we just
hung out on the couch I think we got a
lot better at it because we just sort of
accepted the fact that we couldn't
separate yeah whereas the beginning
you're like oh god you keep you keep
room and bring it over and over and over
for the bathroom and we're gonna clean
our faces and cough Seki watches her
face with my those spinny things she
washed my face with this penny thing I
was like oh my gosh my face is so clean
you're not gonna like putting my makeup
on with me
oh I'm not not really okay you put your
whole hand up showing things but you're
dancin I'm done with my my gypsy sisters
not twins
it was the most timid penciling in of
the eyebrows that I've ever had on my
face and so one took him back I'm in one
direction he did one side of my face I
did the other join under once I was like
I'm it just made me nervous I didn't
want to ruin it I don't think you're
gonna be happy that's pretty good I just
didn't want to screw it up
we're headed out and we have our
incognito handcuffs off we're on our way
to see a movie in custody which would be
very easy to do because we know
Hollywood hold hands is moving anyway
did have one challenge because I
whenever we ride in cars I sit shotgun
in an uber and she sit in the back or
whatever I'm being we have to get into
best peace car commander Skarr did a
little hist car okay one yeah we did it
it was like it was all fun you know when
we're out in the world and handcuffs
that made it like a game it was like a
secret gypsum along with it was it was
very fun I think it just reinforced
things that I already knew about Keith
he doesn't like to wake up early are you
gonna get up make breakfast
number four 7:00 on Saturday I would
like to hold hands in public okay here
we are
and now we can finally take this off 24
hours done time to unshackle ourselves
tenon
we're here in town I think it's like
everything everything starts out a
little bit hard and then you learn how
to deal with it and it's fine but I
didn't hate Becky at the end of it you
know when we're still gonna get married
we still decided we got one
what half time winner</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
