engaged I would say for three years six
pound robot hi there

what are we gonna go with we're going
with Tristan okay that's it we thought
about this after months and months our
baby meet Kesha America babies mostly
used in high schools and it's based on
like a real baby curriculum so that the
students can kind of be tested on how it
would be to really interact with a real
baby you need to beat it and burpin
rocking it changing the diaper and
recorded like it's all being recorded in
here you can tell apparently with you
mishandle this few or if you're you're
in it and then when we're done there's a
whole report that tells us how we did
which we're gonna do fine all right let
the baby Tristan wait
I gotta learn how to get into the car or
the baby oh no milks not I'm here you
know bringing home to the first time
here you go all right there you go
Megan friendly for our vegan baby
so uncared vertical is on the bottle oh
that's a hey that's what he wanted this
is quite a workout now I get why I like
new moms have such good arms I'm gonna
look up how to wrap a baby when I was
inside ordering the food like I was
wondering his catcher crying like were
you okay were you stressing I kept
looking so just kind of like look
there's enough room for jr. in that nice
women yeah all right nothing around
readiness we're gonna take her on a
little walk at the park right across the
street
you're really getting any luncheon you
really good yeah
we're raising our baby vegan food look

nyla ah someone here nyla
I think he's enjoying the show so
ketchup there's your godmother if you
Oprah did it let's go let's go so catch
your bread how do moms do this kitchen I
love either one I'll be crying now that
this experience is over how do we feel
Patrick think we feel like we need to
take a nap kind of tired I'm trying to
remember tire seems like the right word
right about now yeah it's a lot it's a
lot to worry about him to think about um
our overnight experiences with Tristan
was pretty good he was a little fussy
for a while when we put her to bed she
was she was an angel really like she did
not make a peep I think we did pretty
darn well I think we did good
I know I think he did really good I
think we did I really do think we dig
him it says it you guys got a 86% 86% I
thought we'd do better
no way so I really liked seeing Ronnie
with like the five
Atos sitting there rocking the baby
because I don't think you realize it but
you're like that just made me feel
really good about like I can count on
you to do this in the future we have
kids for me basically having a kid or
having like Castro for 24 hours kind of
like made me feel closer to Patrick and
Mamie like just like like yeah like
there's no second thoughts or something
whispering inside of you saying are you
sure about this a sure about him you
sure about the kid it's promised to talk
a lot about having kids in the future
and what we wanted yeah III think this
was a really helpful experience I get it
like all couples should talk about
basically your experience guys we still
want to get married ha ha that's a good
question do we still want to get married
Patrick um yeah I'm down let's do cancel
to cancel a wedding wait
marriage is a lot easier than kids yes

married yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
