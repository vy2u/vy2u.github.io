second day well what's your credit score
check please
it follows you everywhere in life
whether you're buying a house renting
getting a car the next thing will be
planning for is saving for a wedding so
that's pretty big you don't have it then
you have nothing but if you do have it
then you pretty much have endless
possibilities I want to be able to make
the wedding big like she's always
dreamed up want to buy a house yeah
house with like a like a front yard or
backyard well for apartments for ones
because it's not that fun to be a couple
of with a roommate house Alex our
roommate will not see this videos I
think I will have the better credit car
loans on her mind every time it's
brought up she says oh you better handle
this rights like raps about it
one rap it's not a lot that rhymes with
800 that's though I think he's better
Yeah right
like three times a foot like I don't
know when I checked my last about a year
year and a half ago five or six months
ago we don't have credit scores yeah I
want to say I'm sorry to you now don't
run away
I'd say it's about time to find out yep
I love you
are you gonna like cry about it all day
oh this is gonna be a concern though oh
it says it's poor that's actually better
than you made it sound yeah I don't like
they do not pay my bill - well it's
about 30 points higher that's really
nice okay as I won yours drum roll oh
wow how about that that's good rice
solid number yeah that's bad I will
definitely check my credit a lot more
frequently ha ha ha ha be one in the
know about it a little more hope for the
house I I was never worried about credit
score thanks to you guys I'm kind of
very now and don't fully understand how
it even works and I think I should find
that out I know it's gonna take time but
I'd like to know what I could do like
right now to fix this a little bit this
might have been the last thing in our
relationship that we didn't talk about
you know we talked about all the the
future this that but we never made sure
that that could happen things just got
real I think we'll check it every
morning just to remind ourselves how
really truly very good our credit is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
