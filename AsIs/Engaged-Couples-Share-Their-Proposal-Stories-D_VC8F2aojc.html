to propose to me so being the weird
person that he is he decided to just do
all of them I did for a moment think
like he was either gonna mug me or marry
me he gets down on his one knee you mind
you one is broken of course she said yes
but afterward she's like but you didn't
even ask me anything
my boyfriend didn't post me once he
proposed to me four times we just kind
of went for a hike spontaneously and
then randomly he just turns to me and
he's like will you marry me just like
what I'd forgot to say yes that's how in
shock I was I was just staring at this
ring in his hand
and I just kept saying what over and
over again it's like are you sure like
really he's the type who will like stand
outside of your window with a boom box
that's what I was expecting so I was
just so thrown by this and then I took
the ring away from me and he was like
I'm gonna propose to you again this is
just the first time I was like why it's
I was not allowed to tell anyone that
this had happened like I couldn't even
tell my parents
it sounds really terrible but it was
actually like really fun to have this
weird secret I got a new job and so I
needed to fly out for two weeks of
training in Barcelona Spain sign know I
used to live in Barcelona and that's
where me my fiancee had originally met
so I had a friend out there that had
actually came to New York to find her
wedding dress she's like listen don't
make plans for the Saturday I want to
thank you for helping me find a dress
that day comes the location that we were
meeting was called bunker del Kamel it's
a beautiful location in the mountains
over viewing the entire city so there we
are we get to the mountain park the car
have to like hike up this hill mind you
I'm in six-inch heels walking on rocks
so I start to walk up these stairs and I
look to the left and I see someone
holding flowers that looks like my
fiance his name is Kitty Hawk oh I could
not even comprehend if that was even him
or not because I'm in Barcelona I'm here
for training he's back in New York
really looks like idiot code is even on
crutches like Kitty Hawk oh and I'm
looking at him and he's like he tells me
to come over here so like oh my god
that's Kitty Hawk oh my friend in the
background you know screaming her fiance
is taking photos I'm just sitting here
trying to understand how Kitty Hawk was
here probably took an hour to climb this
mountain up and crutches
he claims he said will you marry me I
don't remember that
but he gets down on his one me mind you
one is broken and he asked me I said yes
don't remember that either but here's a
photo of him on his knee it actually
took him like five minutes to get back
up since he had one leg the second time
it happened we were at a Green Day
concert they played the last chord and
we're all just like singing the words so
he just took the ring and shoved it
right in front of my face it was like
will you marry me I was just like this
is amazing when I got engaged I had been
dating my girlfriend at that time for
about seven years you she was Greek
Orthodox I know she really wanted to get
married in the Greek Orthodox Church so
in order for that to happen
I had my road to orthodoxy classes that
I had to take I actually had to
physically get baptized so I had to take
a bath in olive oil once I was a little
Greek boy I would get my little Greek
princess I got the priest and on a lie
we convinced the rest of our family and
friends that they needed to leave the
chapel so the priest can say a blessing
for my girlfriend and I began doing the
blessing and I pulled the ring out of my
pocket and held it and once he he
finished his blessing when she turned
around I was on one knee and she of
course freaked out and and couldn't
believe it was happening but I couldn't
actually bring myself to say anything so
I just sat there kind of still and was
so choked up that I couldn't say
anything and while she was freaking out
I finally built up the strength to say
like so is that a yes and of course she
said yes but afterwards she's like what
you didn't even ask me anything so after
the baptism we had planned a barbecue at
our house so it quickly turned from a
baptismal barbecue to a engagement
barbecue where we literally broke plates
and took a lot of shots of ouzo and
really celebrated so the next one we
decided to go to Diagon Alley which is
like this part of Harry Potter world
there's this big dragon that sits atop
the whole like city we're just standing
there waiting for it and then all of a
sudden it like breathes fire and right
in that moment he like lifted up the
ring and was like what a marry me that's
like
oh you're crazy but that was a really
cool moment we live together for a few
years before Alan proposed to me it was
the 13th of December and he suggested
that we do our Christmas shopping on the
Upper East Side which was a little weird
because we live in Brooklyn but what I
didn't know was that Alan wanted to
propose to me in Central Park because at
the time my office looked over Central
Park if he thought oh what a nice thing
for you to be able to look out and be
able to see the spot where this special
moment happened every day there are so
many beautiful parts of Central Park
there's ice skating rinks and beautiful
bridges and sculptures and Gardens but
my fiance he decided to pick what I
would say is perhaps the creepiest part
of the park he didn't want that moment
where he got down on one knee and like a
tourist would stop and be like oh my god
he's proposing he picked this bridge
bridge in Central Park but it wasn't one
of the good bridges there was like a
whole bunch of trash underneath it and
like dead plants and it was a dead end
and he kept saying like oh we can walk
underneath that to get to where we're
going I did for a moment think like he
was either gonna mug me or marry me but
I like very tentatively like walked
under this creepy bridge and then I
turned around and he was on one knee and
he proposed it was very very sweet but
it was the creepiest bridge I've ever
seen in my whole entire life so the last
one he used drone and there was this
beautiful sunset happening at the time
and so I was watching a fly around and
it sort of circled back and then it came
over to me and right as it was like
sliding across the lake and where I was
standing in this like really cinematic
way he just like got down on one knee I
was just like yes now it's official
we're engaged we can tell people and I
was like finally
here's a photo of our engagement photos
that we did in Florida you can see we
did some underwater shots pretty much
drowned for five hours no one tells you
that actually but it was very cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
