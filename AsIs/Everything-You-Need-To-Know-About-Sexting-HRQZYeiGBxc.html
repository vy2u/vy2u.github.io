with inventing bifocals the odometer the
first American political cartoon and the
lightning-rod but did he also inventing
one day in 1779 Franklin wrote a letter
to Madame pre-owned which included the
following passage you renounce and
totally exclude all that might be of the
flesh in our affection if this wasn't
the sex of its day it was certainly an
early booty call people have been coming
up with sexy messages and pictures since
way before cellphones in 1926 frida
kahlo sent this self-portrait to her
boyfriend on a honeymoon when they were
having some troubles soon after he got
the portrait they got back together
so in Frida's case the sext totally
worked but it took a lot more effort
than snapping a pic in the mirror the
modern term was coined in 2004 in a
Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail
they called it sext messaging a phrase
that almost sounds quaint ten years
later it's tough to find reliable data
on sexting because you know it's usually
done in secret in 2008 cosmoGirl comm
conducted a survey and found that one in
five teen sent naked pictures of
themselves to another person research
also suggests that approximately 15
percent of adults in the US have
received a sexually suggestive pic or
video six percent have sent one and
three percent have forwarded one along
that's millions of foreign nudes
in 2011 the first major sexting scandal
hit Congress Anthony Weiner took a below
the waist photo and sent it to a female
college student in Seattle after a month
of saying he got hacked congressman
Weiner admitted to sending the pics and
resigned in June of 2011 a recent poll
by a software tracking company
determined that the most popular time
for sending a sexy text is between 10
a.m. and noon on Tuesdays
does that make Tuesday morning the new
Saturday night what do you think is
sexting just the modern evolution of
racy love notes or this is serious
societal problem that needs to be
addressed let us know in the comments
but no sexting please</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
