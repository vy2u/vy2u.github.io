to try thick mint beer which is inspired
by Thin Mints
both were Girl Scouts and texted every
word I have a small troop so I think we
got away with more I was a Girl Scout
through and through got my Silver Award
I was a Girl Scout all the way until
brownies and then I was like all the way
that's like for today dropped out after
the brownies I really liked Girl Scouts
I loved like singing the songs and doing
the pledges Girl Scouts was the first
place that I ever went to where I was
surrounded by women and the goal was to
empower each other
there's some bubbles in that it comes
out feisty this would be so fun for like
a Girl Scout themed party here hmm
that's very good every time to take a
sip of it I feel like my stomach's being
cut maybe this is for the leaders when
the middle school girls are off like
fighting and squabbling in the corner I
had a hard time selling cookies to
people honestly I don't think you'd have
a hard time selling this beer to people
it's very true to the cookie I think it
does taste like a thin mint that's the
only thing that's missing for me though
those like classic stock photo Girl
Scout images yeah and the sidebar about
how women are doing wonderful things add
that in right under the 21st you open it
for the gimmick and then you stick
around because it actually tastes pretty
great and it's refreshing I'll say this
doesn't make me want to try other Girl
Scout cookie beer flavors animal cracker
yes no aversion lights yeah we're the
same we call it caramel Delites because
we're from Texas I'm a supreme you need
someone that shares that I'm gonna
become an adult Girl Scout and I'm gonna
sell this beer and I'll fulfill my
brownie drop-out dreams
we did it we conquered and we deserve a
cracker I think I agree this makes me
want to have a club here we're like all
the former Girl Scouts get together and
we drink this
you
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
