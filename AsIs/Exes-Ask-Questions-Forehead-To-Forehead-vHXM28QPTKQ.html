share my truth and to be honest with
myself and honest with her too
I have no idea what's going on today
my name is Carl Monroe and I was in a
relationship for three years with Sarah
Trevino in the beginning it was great I
had experimented with another person we
will say we just fell apart we hated
each other I just needed time to figure
out who I was my name is Ari
I dated steve-o for about two and a half
years we met in school or senior year of
college we decided to end it mainly cuz
of belief
I'm nervous about today because I don't
know what to expect I'm cool with
awkwardness exes talk forehead to
forehead it's a good thing I got a big
one huh you want to take the first
question sure
which do you prefer tampons or pads
neither Diva Cup I forgot about that
I've let the blood Cup do you shave your
pubes I do not take a straight razor I'm
not the Sweeney Todd of all barbers what
was the thing that annoyed you most
about me your anger I guess okay the
thing that annoyed me most about you
things like how to decorate a room
certain way or fold something a certain
way was I a bad boyfriend she laughs cuz
it's a yes you were mostly a good
boyfriend
thank you you put yourself first a lot
but that doesn't make you better okay do
you feel ruined by the outcome of our
relationship it's like it's a I don't
know I should be like really like angry
and I was
it's not it's not easy but it's um I I
look back fondly so yeah I really like
that uh you're uh like down to adventure
and handle things very gracefully but
now I'm like really happy about it I
wouldn't take it back how would you feel
if my next relationship was with a guy
I'd be happy about it
really yeah what's your favorite food I
enjoyed it a little shake it up I have
some personal things I need to work out
I'm glad that we're friends and I hope
this doesn't ruin our friendship and we
continue to continue to be friends just
because the relationship ended doesn't
mean that the relationship has ended we
still have a love for each other just
not in love with each other</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
