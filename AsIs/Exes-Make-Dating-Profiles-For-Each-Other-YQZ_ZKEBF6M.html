you're just a little hyperactive girls
little you're a little shaky yeah well
but I have that effect on people my
dating profile is silly enough I imagine
she could probably make a dating profile
for me than the one I already have I'm
going to match his personality and make
it very goofy and a little over the top
we broke up because we fought a lot and
we didn't really bring out the best in
each other when we broke up she blocked
me on Facebook blocked me on Instagram
talked me off snapchat and blocked my
number we broke up for a variety of
reasons but mostly logistical because I
was graduating college and he had a year
left you kind of have to go through a
lot of bad relationships to appreciate
the good ones and I totally agree
Gina was definitely a good relationship
I'm definitely gonna have fun with it I
know she will too so I think it's going
to be interesting
I've never made a dating profile before
so this is very interesting
I'm a straight man so I'm gonna give her
the username that people used to call us
because we're Kate and Kate so I was
late Kate and she was bitch cave who
would take the name theater donkey I'm
going with cycling blue let's see if
that works cuz she got really blue eyes
and she likes cycling I love Green Team
cuz he did image underscore nation she
phones one she bows one
how would your best friend describe you
this is just words do you just put words
Oh white is gonna break out I will love
my cat more than I'll ever love you
don't worry
I'll remind you of this fact daily it
did happen daily she told me daily while
holding her cat they would also tell you
to feed me frequently because I get
cranky I could write a lot of stuff but
if this is just the first box I keep it
simple really good at oh I will brag a
little I think people be like why is
this person flattering themselves really
good at crying she's really good at
cuddling that'll be a little nice thing
there for you bitch Kate continue on a
typical Friday night she is usually
bartending and she'll probably say
something like lol we're having a drink
or 10 with another five Rhett no I'm
having a lot of fun thinking of all the
random things that you probably say
really wanted to say sleeping with
everyone but I don't want to make her
seem like or so what's not good with
that
alright I finished them all this is
oddly therapeutic I think she already
gotta like
ready oh I love green tea 7:10 it's
accurate
I like amazing in that picture I look
that's Fisher so most people would look
at me though I like that you don't know
what blue really means yeah
my user name is bitch Kate I like it
I have cheekbones that can slice through
butter but makes me an ideal match for
someone who loves toast with butter
listen my cat is my child so I got stats
fact they also tell you to eat me
frequently because I get cranky I know
that and when I'm not working on a
project I'm being a hell of a
compartment like that I'm really good at
crying being late to pretty much
everything making people laugh trying
new things trying to solve problems
the emphasis on trying oh I didn't mean
it that way I'm a great cuddler
I would like more hey there you go as I
said I will ignore when you fart in your
sleep the six things I could never do
you that's totally not six things on a
typical Friday night I am usually
pretending that ago I'm with a ha ha no
you're not you're in lol no I'm more of
a ha ha if I'm not betting I would be
participating intramural sports which is
true message me if you're a guy who
doesn't let anything get in the way of
his dreams and passion it's what keeps
us going right Oh keep this is nice
message me if you like oversensitive
people who literally take everything to
heart you know if I react to this it
proves her right so I'm not going to say
anything I'll take a page from your book
and I'll stay silent I feel like our
profiles are absolutely really similar
which is not surprising it's really hard
to go into this and you don't know how
you want to go about it oh I knew
exactly how I wanted to go about course
you did yours was very nice it was
really hard to do yours though I'm a
nice guy ladies my lovely hopefully who
bit me on the face the first time I
stayed over that should have been a sign
heal that was a sign he also tried
take your hair tie as you were trying to
wake up I was really cute see you can't
even like be mad about my cat because my
cats really cute</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
