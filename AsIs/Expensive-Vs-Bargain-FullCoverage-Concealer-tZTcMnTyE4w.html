look at that
my skin I have a port-wine stain on half
of my face as far as like the conditions
it gets a mixture between like dry and
oily I have had really bad like cystic
acne for a long time sometimes I find
issues with with finding like a really
good concealer I want my skin not to
react or get even more acne I have it a
Lego and now that it's spread so much
across my face I don't really wear a lot
of makeup but I'm definitely interested
to see which concealers can work if I
decided to do this I am hoping to
actually find like a good concealer it
would help me in some problem areas like
not even my birthmark I do I think it's
worth it to pay if it works packaging
and I mean I get simple gets to the
point
it says waterproof great what I'm crying
bad sometimes the waterproof ones are
like really tough to take off it's
definitely really creamy seems a little
thick it goes on pretty smooth doesn't
really seem to be doing too much
honestly it's definitely spreadable I'm
definitely covering up my blemishes
feels kind of wet though which makes me
worried if it's like oily I read I feel
like it gives me like way more of a shy
that I already have let's see if it's
gonna cover up this middle eye though so
it's kind of see-through when it comes
to like covering up play the dark to the
light
so the coverage of it is not so good
based on the concealers that I've used
before this one's not too bad the whole
like gotcha Covered like full coverage I
would definitely recommend to just be
like hiding of coverage okay almost want
to say like it's like five or six bucks
well eight dollars
well then I'll buy a couple of them
honestly if it was anything more than
that I would not be happy if you have
dry skin this actually might be kind of
nice
I really like the packaging of it it
looks like you spent money on it
however products I honestly usually like
it when it's a squeeze tube so that way
I can like put it on the back of my hand
smells really good it's really thick
it's kind of hard to blend in
you saw glide it off definitely giving
me some coverage I do like the
consistency it's very concentrated it's
not greasy at all I can see that it's
over top of all my pores I feel like I'm
like seeing every single one it covers
like my blemishes and things like that
but when it comes to the darker areas -
the lighter areas in my skin it doesn't
really cover for someone that may not
need a lot of coverage I think this
would be a really solid choice but I
feel like this is more just like a you
got one pimple you want to cover it up
and I think this costs probably around
twenty dollars one two three twenty
three yeah that's about what I think Kat
Von D would put it as I don't know if I
had spent twenty five I would say for
that and it's because I know that it's
gonna last all day
a lot of this is in a different language
let the cute beauts
I like sleek in just simple supposed to
pull it oh there it is okay I do kind of
like that it's a stick form you can kind
of just glide it on it goes on really
well this definitely feels super light
it was just so soft it feels like that
if it's on my face it feels almost like
moisturize look at it do you see that
it's Oh it blends really well like it's
thick and but it's also movable this is
the one that's covering my skin
it feels like velvet and it smells good
so I wonder how good this would look for
Instagram yeah it looks good I mean it
kind of has that little bit of a shine
to it
yeah the coverage is pretty good I mean
I feel like I'd have to put like quite a
bit on if I wanted to even out the
birthmark I think the dark spots that
like covers perfectly the redness I
don't quite know if it's totally
covering it up the way two dishes
covered like a dream Susy's I almost
want to say like it's 20 bucks cuz I
just that's all I want to pay on
concealer 33:47 it's a terrific
conciliar 1 inch is $70 a gorgeous
French man I'm gonna be playing as on me
every single day it's so good but it's
so I'm given an 8 Kat Von D 8 and a half
maybe a 6 v flip-flop like a 9 out of 10
seven and a half a 10 for me I love
experimenting with makeup makeup is so
expressive it's really good you know to
have options as far as coverage goes but
I mean luckily I've gotten to a point of
fully accepting me I've had vitiligo
since I was 5 I've grown into it and I
absolutely love it being different is
the new normal so stand out just be you
it's gonna be fine darling
