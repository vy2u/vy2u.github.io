it almost happened we are putting on aa
riot Kerry makeup Oh what that is the
closest I'm gonna get to meeting her
I'm so excited I feel like I should be
whistle Tony right now but I won't
because if you start doing that I'd be
so excited it's not coming out I'm just
like obsessed with her like diva antics
she is unapologetic she does not give up
oh I most loved her from the MTV Cribs
episode where homegirl changed into a
different outfit for each room that she
showed off I'm not like a 100% Mariah
Carey fan but I respect everything she's
done in her career I have no idea what
to expect but I know it's gonna be very
glamorous I'm expecting glitter that's
all I am expecting really good packaging
because like that's like look at her I
feel like I'm gonna get a lot of lip
gloss I'm gonna get a lot of glitter
trends change and makeup changes but she
pretty much keeps it the same there
might even be some champagne in there
shame you know she loved with this flash
I don't remember all outfit dress oh oh
it's pretty and another neighbor oh
she went in wait wait oh please look at
that is the butterfly on it I'm so dead
and slain she named it darling this one
is called all I want it's not all that
one I'm sorry I'm where I am
that's her comic oh she is a little
comment
oh and it's Mimi that is awesome so far
I am loving this eyeshadow palette
they're pigmented but they're not too
pigmented and they're smooth they're
going on really nicely I'm gonna start
off with a little darling lipstick I'm
also gonna put them all right here
because I have a pimple so I'm gonna try
this
sweet sweet fantasy blush so the names
are like songs of hers iconic sayings
that she would say I feel like after
this we can't go back to work cuz divas
don't work but I think this is for white
people yeah this is not for black folks
how did we miss this yeah okay this has
some sparkle Brown dust
wait it kind of looks sexy in my beard
what's so funny you kind of look like um
a penny you're supposed to say I look
like fantasy I am so glittery I feel
like a Christmas tree angel I just love
the effort you're putting in right now
I'm trying just like my Ryan's trying to
always keep a man oh wow oh yeah now I
feel like we did this correctly with all
of this shine is great this is great
Thank You Mariah
i buy this lip color I like this lip
color these aren't bad colors but I'm
just surprised there's no like it pops
anywhere I need a bold lip try Rihanna
 I think the worst part of it about
this line is the blush the blush feels
very aggressive and Mariah's not
aggressive she's more of a passive
figure she's more like I don't know her
this is like mom makeup I mean that's
accurate Mariah Carey is a wonderful mom
the packaging is my favorite and makes
you feel like I'm putting on makeup I'm
an adult woman honestly I don't think
Mariah gives a and this is how she
wanted it to look and this is how it
looks and you're gonna buy it and she
has a line and you don't so whatever
there you go whoa I did it sibling Rhea</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
