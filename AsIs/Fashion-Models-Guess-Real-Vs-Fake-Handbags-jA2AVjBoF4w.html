all of our senses sometimes even taste
hi I'm Graham watts burger cheese
Authenticator at the real real the
world's leading luxury marketplace I
oversee the daily evaluation of
thousands of luxury goods myself and my
team of experts are professionals at
spotting the difference between genuine
and counterfeit goods today we have some
fashion models on set who are very
useful luxury goods and we're gonna see
if they can spot the genuine from the
counterfeit I personally love vintage so
I know what is quality and what is crap
I've been in fashion for a long time I
own a couple of really nice handbags and
they think I'll be able to tell the
difference the reason that I think I
could figure this out is because my mom
used to always say I had super expensive
tastes because of my entire life I
always pick the more expensive thing
even when I don't know so today we have
two of the most highly sought after
handbags out there we have the Hermes
Birkin and the Hermes Kelly heritage
bags crafted by expert artisans they
sell for $10,000 and up the Hermes Kelly
was designed in the 1930s and then
renamed after Princess Grace carried it
in 1954 Chanel flap was originally
invented in 1955 by Coco Chanel herself
because she wanted a hands-free bag I'm
not going to tell you if one's fake if
they're both fake if they're both real
or what I'm gonna let you use your your
your detective skills and figure it out
for yourself
smells like leather I mean it's got the
you know label right there this is
pretty oh this one's a fake one damn
what makes you say that
cuz when it turns it around you can kind
of just tell you can feel it it's like
in your soul this feels kind of flimsy
for a $10,000 bag I mean if it is a fake
bag it looks really nice too much time
to open the bag I'm at the Grammys I
can't be like yeah I think this one's
the fake the brand name is like so tiny
right here that the writing on here
looks nice
I'm gonna guess this one is it's being
real I think they're both for you I
think they're both real it could be
played I'm taking this one I feel like
this Chanel is real and this one is a
genuine bag okay and this one is the
counterfeit you pick right right it was
kind of it it's a super fake really
high-quality counterfeit meant to meant
to fool everybody I mean you can tell
the difference to by just viewing them
why do this like smell good it smells
like leather cause it's made from real
leather the counterfeit you're getting
no better no matter more and more
sophisticated and more and more
expensive because they really want to
fool the consumer but you're right the
hardware is really flimsy this would
conflict it beep so these are a couple
of great bags for the lady who lunches
they're really sophisticated top handle
this Gucci Lilith bag is inspired by the
1940s bamboo top handles with the fun
element of the snake detailing from
alessandro mikela the Pichette Metis
which is the most popular current style
from Louboutin crazy long wait lists
can't get it anywhere of course monogram
canvas bags are very highly
counterfeited the Fendi peekaboo which
has been around for several seasons and
it's super expensive $4,800 and to such
well to knockoffs as well this is the
Micro Lady Dior the original larger
version was first seen carried by
Princess Diana in the late 90s they
modernized it and shrunk it down why
it's nice all right jack so that's good
this class class seems a little chintzy
this part feels kind of weird there's
like this metal slap in the middle of
the same vibe I want to be able to use
my purse this has got a whole lot in my
wave
and the coloring - I feel like the
counterfeit ones are a little darker in
color right
I feel like Gucci would care about their
metal that's a super detailed detail
calm down oh this one's fake why is that
because this is not even the inside logo
looks pretty good and it's even the
stitching looks even Gucci would have a
way better Kaufman ship and having like
one bolt here and one bolt just like
sometimes when people are trying to fake
bags they'll forget to put like this
situation do you see this dot it says
amoeba Todd on it I've gone with this
bag it just feels like this was actually
hard I can't even tell this is fake I
hate it get it away from me all right no
good guy I feel like this would speak to
on the hardware right here it doesn't
look authentic the similarities between
dat bags is that they're made of PVC and
not leather and the hardware is really
inferior good job thank you I learned so
much awesome all right so what's your
final choice between the two bags which
is real and which is kind of fit real
counterfeit I mean I feel like it's real
she got him right so as we've learned
today if you have a hard time
determining what's real and what's faux
just ask the supermodel friends
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
