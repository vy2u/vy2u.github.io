four years old I remember standing at
the bar in ballet class looking in the
mirror and comparing my body to everyone
else's I remember using food to cope
with my emotional anxieties at an early
age on the outside I had a tremendous
amount of privilege growing up which
made it complicated to live amidst the
pain in my mind and the trauma within my
body I started starving myself at age 11
I struggled with an eating disorder
mostly bulimia for a full decade I was
molested for a year and a half in high
school and raped my first month of
college the week before my younger
brother was hit by a car and killed two
years later I was sitting on my bedroom
floor with my best friend and I laid out
my entire life trauma by trauma and had
a major realization I was killing myself
I had actively been putting my body in
jeopardy for 10 years other people had
violated my body and my brother no
longer had a body at all everyone only
gets one body in their lifetime I knew I
had to start treating mine differently I
made a choice to love my body for the
rest of my life every single day
recovery was like peeling layers of an
onion first I promised myself that
purging was never going to be an option
I learned to sit with what it felt like
not to purge then not to binge then not
to eat emotionally then not to fear food
then not to fear my body and I learned
that how I eat and move has to come
directly from within me it took a lot of
practice and I learned the art of
intuitive eating where I eat what I want
when I want eat when I'm hungry and stop
when I'm full that has single-handedly
been the tangible practice that's
allowed me to maintain full recovery for
the past 10 years I witnessed all the
ways the world tells bodies not to love
themselves from the billion-dollar diet
industry to war racism sexism homophobia
ableism and all oppressions and I know
that the choice to love my body is both
revolutionary for my ability to live in
my own body and also the key
me too allowing me to love and respect
other people's bodies because I made a
choice to recover fully
I decided every day doesn't have to be a
struggle I've learned to sit with my
feelings to feel everything and wait and
it's utterly intoxicating and even
though I love my entire body there are
moments that are difficult and sometimes
I feel fat and when I think I feel fat
I remember that fat is not a feeling
there's no such thing as feeling fat so
when I feel fat I know that means I'm
feeling something else and it's worth
figuring out what that is in these
moments especially I take deep slow
breaths and I remember that my body's
ability to do this incessantly
unconsciously and involuntarily is a
miracle I choose to be grateful in these
moments grateful for everything my body
can do and everything my body has
overcome I choose to love my body</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
