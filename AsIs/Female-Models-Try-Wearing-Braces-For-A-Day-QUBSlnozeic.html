the kind of modeling I do is actually
plus-size modeling I've been modeling
for a ten plus two years I've done
lingerie modeling women suit modeling
fitness commercially print I did have
braces in ninth grade for about nine
months probably could have been a little
bit longer my top teeth I'm pretty happy
with I had braces I think he's one of
those sixth-grade Adam for about two
years now one of our braces for a day
because I want to help get over my fear
of what people think about me or how
people see me they think just from the
outside that I'm a pretty person but
it'll be fun to see if people judge me
differently now because I have braces an
adult
my roommates cars here so I'm going to
see what her expressions in what she has
to say hmm
what put those on okay there's no way
you know I go your teeth are
straightened in all hell you don't need
braces showing at work right now and I'm
just about to reveal to my coworker my
new life decision it looks good
I couldn't eat with them like I just
felt uncomfortable and definitely had
like the drool going off the side of the
cheeks just we don't have scented from
being in it I think I learned that I
care more about my parents that maybe I
anticipated I just had a guy that was
like flirting with me and then I smile
down and his face was like yes he was so
scared like really really it's just
bracelets reactions so straight people
like look at me differently and the like
the looks that I get are just
doesn't make you feel good at all my
confidence level definitely went down um
it's definitely more like nervous and
just afraid kind of of people judging me
I was self-conscious I definitely didn't
smile nearly as much if I laughed it was
definitely an underhanded laughs I think
after this video in this experiment I
will treat people with braces a lot
different like I will probably go up to
them and be like I feel your pain
understand what you're going through but
the payouts gonna be amazing and
probably just compliment them more
because no one really complimented me
this weekend the best moment for me was
seeing my friends reactions that that
didn't change their opinion immediate
and change their energy didn't change
they just acted silly and goofy and and
treated me just the way that I usually
am anyone that has braces right now I
suggest you just own who you are
love yourself let your personality shine
through and the people that are there
for you will be with you no matter what
you look like
so just be</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
