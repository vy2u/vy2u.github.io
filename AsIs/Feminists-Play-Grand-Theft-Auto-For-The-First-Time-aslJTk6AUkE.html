your typical average everyday Jane
I've heard about prostitutes and about
racing cars and beatin people up I know
that GTA is a satire on American culture
it's a game just full of like terrible
shitty things happening to women
yeah I'll shoot some people so I just
shot some I shot three people in front
of a hot badass hey come back here I'm
gonna shoot you don't move dog can I
adopt that dog and like move oh my god
the cops are after me I just killed
somebody
oh I'm gonna die okay I think I just got
knocked out I'm not gonna accomplish
anything sexist in this game cuz I'm
just gonna be dead I'm at a strip club
vanilla unicorn gentlemen's club horny
girls it says great let's see what else
it says premium lounge oh my god
everywhere this is so weird
this would be appealing to someone who's
never spoken to a human woman uh-oh my
god this is horrible
what No if anyone who's ever been to a
strip club you're not supposed to touch
the stripper bro no you were like going
through your formative years and this
was your only experience with women it
would be really really damaging and
weird I wrote a blog post about why you
hate video games because this is what it
does it feels like the male fantasy
we're picking up a prostitute Oh
oh I oh I killed her ah no wait get up
oh you want a little bonfire what the
prostitute I want to show her a nice
time under this could be like a pretty
woman situation because like they're not
kissing on the mouth no the whole thing
is vibrating you just finished oh if I
kill her I get my money back
that's really
like dad it's all just kind of - now if
you went and you know had a nice time
with sex workers that'd be fine that's a
great thing to do just don't beat the
 out of them and then like run from
comp yeah I actually had a lot of fun
but I'm a little disappointed at the
lack of like Eddie strong female
characters but all of it was fun in a
way that I know is terrible these games
much like the rest of the media caters
so much to the male fantasy and like how
much time the designers probably put
into like building that woman's body
he's feeling good I'm sorry</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
