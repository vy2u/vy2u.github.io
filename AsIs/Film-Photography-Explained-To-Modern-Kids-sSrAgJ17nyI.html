just snap a dozen shots of your launch
and then quickly review them to make
sure that you had the perfect shot of a
big mimic to capture a moment in time as
image you wouldn't use a camera out
you'd use a camera to record the photo
onto a thing called Ville and it was
kind of a completely different thing
nowadays photos are intangible and
ubiquitous they come from the phones in
our pockets and live forever on Facebook
and Instagram and your defunct Flickr
account but it used to be you could only
take as many photos as you had roll on
this film stuff it was this dark plastic
tape that came in these black little
tubes and he couldn't expose it to light
like gizmo when you filled the tape up
with photos and there was only room for
like 24 or 36 you couldn't just pull
them out and look at them deleting the
ones you didn't like in fact you'd have
no idea what your photos even looked
like until you took them to the shop
that would print them out for you when
you got them back everyone would crowd
around to see what that vacation or
party for weeks or months or even years
ago looks like the way you shared a
photo of someone back then was you put
it in their hands and sometimes you
collected your favorites in these
physical books sometimes you'd find an
envelope of photos from a summer long
ago in the bottom of shoe box and it was
like finding a time capsule film photos
don't just look different I mean they
did there's something about the way they
look that is undeniable
but when he only had 24 shots you
thought about them differently you had
to pick the moments that matter to you
and when you saw a photo from your life
that brought you back to summer camp or
college or childhood vacation you knew
how unlikely was to get that shot
it was once-in-a-lifetime and that's
what made it special</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
