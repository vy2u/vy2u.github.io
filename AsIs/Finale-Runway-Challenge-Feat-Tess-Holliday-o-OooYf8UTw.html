started one of my favorite body-positive
movements at their beauty standards
let's welcome Tess Holliday yay this is
something that I feel like people need
especially right now so right you know
I'm happy to be a part of it I also feel
like this is something that you've done
a lot put people online with Instagram
that like wouldn't normally get seen and
you've created platforms that allow
other people to feel like comfort in a
community it's always good to give
people like you said a chance to
actually get to be themselves and like
be appreciative for just being exactly
yeah last week our competitors had to
show us their best love yourself hashtag
as is challenge Anthony Florida solved I
did absolutely amazing we had to fly
them out here ASAP Oso and Victoria we
were really weighing back and forth on
them and we couldn't decide so we ended
up inviting them to the finale - so now
we have our top three competitors cool
here they are I'm feeling excited I'm
feeling nervous I'm feeling like I want
to cry and puke at the same time I've
never been to LA before so this was
brand new for me the show first had to
pick me out I felt like luxury Kroger
with a BMW I was like winning feat
famous will truly mean the world to me
it would validate that my dreams are
actually a real thing like my parents
want me to become a doctor life imagine
me as a doctor like I love fashion and
that's why I want to reshape the
industry basically and change it so that
everyone can feel represented win or
lose I'm already winning because
honestly if I do lose I'm just gonna be
the Jennifer Hudson of the season I
watch so many submission videos
don't even yeah I'm real I'm so glad
that you're here you deserve this so
much you've worked so hard
super excited guys today it's gonna be a
day it's gonna be a lot for all of us me
too I'm really excited to put you guys
to the test we're gonna be doing it's
gonna be a lot but I know you can handle
I'll see you you just want to surprise
me like that that's all y'all doing here
everyone's like so cute I thought at
first Anthony was my favorite and then I
moved on to Oso and then I yeah I'd like
I love everybody yeah that's why we're
sitting here with three and everybody
has their own niche demographic so I
know they're gonna be helping out the
world in better places but you just need
to get to that this week for the finale
our competitors have two challenges the
first challenge I put them to a little
test with a photo shoot and this is how
it was I'm really excited about the
photo shoot today
I like a celebrity you don't like
something I'm extremely nervous because
I've never been in a photo shoot before
and I'm very excited I just want to do
the best I can
I've never been in front of cameras like
this so I don't know what to expect so
I'm just like expecting the unexpected
welcome my top three competitors I'm so
excited for you guys to be here we are
here with our two photographers Macey
and Jon the shoot today is gonna be
super fun it's gonna be old Hollywood
glam
since we brought you here into Hollywood
we figured we'd stick with the theme but
you're gonna be posing with a little
special guest oh my god I'm gonna feel
like Britney I'm so afraid of snakes my
body is so ready I'm gonna live my
Britney fantasy I am about to piss
myself I'm so nervous
she's huge I feel okay my name is
Jeffery from critter squad wildlife
defenders and today I have an awesome
friend of mine his name is banana banana
is an albino Burmese python they're one
of the fifth largest snake on the planet
and they can reach up about 13 feet and
weigh close to a hundred pounds so these
guys are super awesome and as you can
tell he's super beautiful hope you guys
are gonna have a good time today I'm
here for moral support
I'll be far but I support you guys we do
like locust and Eris in Puerto Rico and
one of them wanted to have a snake in
her party they just brought a snake and
I held it and that's how I lost you know
my fear of snakes I'm not afraid I like
I know that they're not gonna do
anything but like if I seen one on the
floor or something like that I would not
touch it like I wouldn't set myself up
like that I don't know how I'm gonna do
it but I'm gonna try to give face and to
just die inside and no choice
get over here just like this and you can
hold your hand up
I just got banana on me and I feel I
still have hair on I have no idea how it
went but it was like such a rush just to
have her on my body and then she went to
like my head a little bit and I was
nerve-racking I can hear her breathing
and her desire to like eat me the whole
thing was very surreal perfect wow it's
like we've done this before or something
she was pulling all of my hair down and
I could barely like lift my arms because
she was so so heavy it's just crazy but
I'm so happy I did it I'm so proud of
myself and after this I hope that I'm
gonna be able to be friends with all of
the snakes in the world so I'm very
happy Wow I'm sorry is this your album
cover yeah right I feel great I feel me
in the snake world one Wow like it's you
yes sometimes I felt bad cuz I could
feel some of this like scales clinging
on me and sometimes they'll get kind of
tight but overall banana did her thing
or his thing 1 2 3
perfect hopefully it was enough I was
kind of nervous during the shoot just
because you know the spotlight but I had
a great time and I feel confident that
there's a good picture early to get me
through
holding the snake it was really heavy I
just imagined that this thing was like a
scarf that was moving so you just gotta
be calm and collected and I think I
really did turn it out and you know we
took like five shots and I think we
already got it so there's gonna take you
for safety the snake out one point did
land on my face but I just like had to
go with the flow because I knew it was
gonna be a sickening as picture Wow what
you're perfect I had so much fun
I love being a present they camera
honestly so it was easy for me I'm
hoping I did enough to win you are doing
it I think we're done all right
the first challenge is over with for the
finale I'm so proud of you guys you all
work so much more chill than I would
have been all of you literally served it
in your own way and I am so proud this
is gonna be the hardest but we don't
have to think about that right now we
are going into tomorrow for the second
half of the challenge and I'll better
bring it I'm ready are you guys ready
good luck you guys I'll see you tomorrow
so cute I know for the second challenge
this week our competitors have to walk
in a live runway show here they have to
bring it they have to walk in front of
everybody and I am so excited for them
so excited so nervous yeah I hope so we
will be judging the competitors
photoshoots and their runway challenge
on three factors the first factor is
feed worthiness so would you like this
photo would you like their runway walk
would you send it to a friend would you
save it for inspo the next is fierce
factor like are they bringing it are
they serving at both in the photo and in
the runway show our final category is
originality which is one of the most
important to me I want to make sure that
they're still remaining their selves you
know authenticity is so important
exactly everyone has like such fun
energy and I feel like they will totally
bring it but I'm a little
just to see because obviously they're
not models but that doesn't matter on
the runway it's all about like confident
exact so I feel like though I'll bring
it yeah I'm excited I'm feeling great
really excited I'm super nervous super
excited I gotta get ready for this Sean
likes always fighting I can't believe
it's already here I mean I was excited
but now I'm totally feeling the
vibration and the energy the real thing
when we just not falling you know if I
could do that we good yes I tried it to
go like a little bit are there this gear
that's belicoff so I can like change
this around I'll bring in chub and style
that's are you gonna see the deuces
can't wait to play nice table welcome to
today's feed famous finale runway show
clothes brought to us by kid foul I'm
very excited we have our top three
competitors here they've been working
their butts off and they're here to
compete for who's gonna be comfy famous
joining them on the runway or our past
two competitors Rosie and divinity as
well
and they're amazing too and I'm so
excited that everyone's here to
experience this okay
I don't know what just happened
I wanted
that was insane though it was the
hottest fashion show I've ever smelled
this amazing it was like the biggest
party it was so nice we're still gonna
watch them shine and be really beautiful
in their own game honestly any of them
could win they're gonna have a tough job
who's gonna win so we have their photos
from their photo shoot and we've seen
their runway walks now we have to
deliberate and see who is going to
become feed famous here's number one
Victoria that's so major it's a great
photo the only thing I would have done
differently is like lowered her to know
which I'm guilty of you had other than
that it's a really great photo this male
line in her body in her curves
she was very terrified about this snake
yeah you can't have that as far as feed
worthiness I would comment I would like
I would take this and probably send this
to someone that could take my photo and
be like I want to do that I might like
making a background before my face on
top of first because I would feel like I
wanna I want to do that fierceness like
this is fierce I think that she killed
the runway doing her little stomp and
her arms up and I was like yes girl like
it was so good as far as originality her
outfits were so original and so stylish
when you said that she styled herself I
couldn't even believe it
I feel like Victoria really covered a
lot of what our categories are so oh so
Oh
okay that's so good he's really like
sure and like centered and like he's
holding the snake in his hand like it's
a no big right feed worthiness I know I
would definitely like this I would
comment on it I would send it to my
friend
exactly after Beauty say yes Oh fierce
Factor definitely this is fierce what I
did also love and osos runway show
he watched the first time and kind of
fumbled right his glasses flew off he
did not miss a beat though so I was very
proud of him it wasn't as like
theatrical as the others but it was like
his yeah you know I totally agree he
worked it and that definitely goes into
the category of being original I think
Oso kept at him he stayed Stern and he
stayed bold which is nothing more I
could ask for okay Anthony look at that
snake on top of his hat as far as feed
worthiness if I saw this I think I would
audibly like gasp I would be like oh my
gosh this is so good
it is so good he's showing versatility
are you doing he's Daliah great I think
as far as fierceness anything Anthony
does is gonna be fierce I just feel like
something's missing
yeah also if I was holding a giant
yellow snake by my head Oh
kudos for even doing it yes Anthony can
put on a show and that's exactly what he
did he killed the runway yeah made it
his own my favorite part was when he
like walked past like he was gonna walk
off the runway and then said the little
back room so good every single time was
different I feel like as far as
fierceness and originality
those were Anthony's strong points in
the fashion show also all the
contestants styled themselves and
Anthony's looks were I was like I was
gagging like they were so good I can't
pick anything that I didn't love about
his walk what makes it so hard as
everyone has their own thing and I think
that none of them could replicate what
the other one is doing and everybody
brought fierceness all across the board
I love that also
so the runway was a little bit shaky to
me with us on this picture
100% is really hoping this is one of my
favorite pictures I feel like this snake
could be out of the picture and we would
still look at this picture and just be
like damn as far as Anthony it's weird
because Anthony has done so well and all
of his photo shoots and definitely
brought it but this is not my favorite
photo of him that I've seen Anthony's
runway but I think I need far oh yes he
did the best the fan yeah the looks and
Mike hands down nailed it so good and
Victoria she is rocking everything on
this photo and she really rocked the
runway as well she did I think we've
decided who has one feed famous and now
it's time to tell them
okay first of all I'm very proud of you
for what you've done in the last two
days and in this competition Anthony you
did so well on your runway walk your
show Victoria your photoshoot you were
terrified and you served so much to us
so much fierceness and I was so proud of
you for overcoming that oh so your photo
from the photo shoot it's an ad like it
is amazing and what I really love about
you is you move your body and you know
how to work your body as you all know
there can only be one winner of fede
famous and that winner is Anthony
look at that prick
I don't even know what to say I'm just
like there's a lot of emotion fun so
I'll have to live for what you create
and die protecting it because your art
is all you got
be they true I'm super happy for Tony I
really think that it was designed for
him to when he did great with his looks
in his pictures he did a great job I'm
so proud of Anthony like I really feel
like he deserves it
this was the hardest decision I've had
to make I think in my life
