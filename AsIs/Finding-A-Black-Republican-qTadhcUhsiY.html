another black guy named Ben who's been
in the news a lot recently Ben Carson's
prominence in the 2016 presidential race
has been a landmark moment for us black
Ben's because there aren't many of us
but one Trey separates Ben Carson from
us black Ben's even farther he's a black
Republican a black Ben Republican has
never been done and that got me thinking
maybe Ben Carson's polling numbers are
proved that they're actually more black
Republicans out there than I thought how
hard could it be to find one I'm our
Republican yeah no no I am NOT no no no
no where do you think in Los Angeles I
could find a black Republican oh if he
hired me in Beverly Hills sad dejected
we returned to our original location
excuse me sir can I ask you a question
for BuzzFeed real quick okay rule are
you a Republican
God happened to smile on us that day I
immediately set up an interview with Roo
hey what's up Roo
I'm good when you were growing up and
you were forming your identity did you
have anyone in your life who were also
Republican who inspired you I wish I
came up in the hood bro you know all
this stuff has been learned through
trials and and errors and God did five
years in the Air Force and that's what
kind of molded me into being a
Republican and I'm not really like
full-blown Republican either I have my
own beliefs have you faced criticism
from other black people because of your
views every day it might not be verbal
but in their actions ain't nobody gonna
size me about why my Republican because
they don't even know why they are
Democrat if someone meets a black
Republican out there in the wild how
should they treat them they should treat
them like any normal human being at the
end of the day bro we should just be
coming together as humans we all share
this planet both so what have I learned
black Republicans do exist they're just
really really hard to find sort of like
a holographic Charizard very rare and
they have real reasons for supporting
the causes that they believe in so the
next time you meet one just probably
never have some compassion because
they're not so different from there yeah
they're just black and Republican
it's here it's here here what get it
you're it they're very hot I got it get
it get it you get it it's here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
