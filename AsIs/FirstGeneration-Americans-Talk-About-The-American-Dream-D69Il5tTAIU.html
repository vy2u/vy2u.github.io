immigrated from the Philippines both of
my parents are from Hungary Luongo
Mexico Philippines Trinidad and Tobago
my mom immigrated to the United States
in the late 70s from Pakistan my dad
came by himself to the u.s. his entire
family to this day still lives in
Denmark my dad grew up in communist
Hungary and he came to America for a
better life my parents American dream
was that their daughters would grow up
to be amazing people they really looked
out for our generation these first gens
because we have it so easy
I remember coming home and my parents
would be working until like 3:00 a.m.
trying to figure out how they can afford
putting us to private school and giving
us the best education live a good life a
long and prosperous life was what my
parents would say so I might define the
American Dream slightly differently than
some other people to meet the American
Dream is the rights to life liberty and
property the American Dream I think is
just all about opportunity I think it's
the chance the American Dream is
definitely something that's in your
control something that's totally audio
in control so it's all about just
circumstance and hard work and
determination and I think the ability to
do what you want is really a huge part
of the American dream and so in that
sense I think I am living the American
dream right now for me I feel like I'll
achieve the American dream once I can
take care of my parents once I can buy
them an expensive home my mom doesn't
even drive but she wants a Lexus and
once I can get her that I feel like I've
done my job the American Dream doesn't
just stop with them I think that I'm
continuing it for them and then
what I have kids that will still
continue because you won't forget the
original story you won't forget like
where they came from
like wow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
