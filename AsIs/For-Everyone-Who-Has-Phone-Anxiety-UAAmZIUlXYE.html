Pepe see if they're still open yeah
mm-hmm okay great thanks when you have
social anxiety talking on the phone can
be terrifying you'll put an extra effort
just to find a way around it
bribe your friends to call for you or
scour the internet to see if hey maybe
this restaurant accepts texts I mean
it's the 21st century why wouldn't they
this fear is commonly referred to as
telephone a phobia or to a lesser extent
telephone apprehension whenever you know
you absolutely have to call your chest
tightens up your breathing quickens like
you're about to jump off a ledge you
know your fear is kind of nonsensical
it's not like the person on the other
side can you know come through the phone
lines and steal your soul unless you're
calling the other world which you know
don't - stop doing that please maybe
it's just a result of feeling so
disconnected from the person on the
other side talking to a stranger in the
first place is scary but over the phone
you can't see their body language the
expression on their face you're going in
blind
Wow telemarketers must just be
constantly putting their pants in a text
or email you can formulate your response
you know truly think it over maybe
putting a fun emoji people love those on
the phone everything is instant and
there's so many opportunities for
miscommunication er oh chord pauses so
take a breath start simple call your
friends and family people you know and
when you have to call a stranger or
business plan out what you're gonna say
you could even write it out yes with a
pen and paper
think about your objective don't worry
about being charming and please don't
call the underworld imagine the long
distance charges</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
