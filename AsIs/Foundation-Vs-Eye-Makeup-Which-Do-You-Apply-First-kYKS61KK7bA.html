puts on her eyeshadow first and I do it
right I think I do it right we'll see
about that
so we're switching routines which is
gonna be very hard for me and for me too
I just learned that when you do your eye
shadow
there's fall-off you know you get it all
down your cheeks but if you start with
your foundation and do all your contour
and
you can't get rid of your eye shadow if
you mess up but then if you put the
eyeshadow on first and then put
Foundation and after it smear everything
no you don't you that that strategy oh
it feels so wrong this feels wrong to
you I feel like if I were to do this
every morning I would just get to my eye
shot and be like I don't want to do it I
never really had fallout problems and if
I did I just kind of like wiped it would
makeup remover and then just kind of
like all your foundation you put
foundation on a fall and then you wipe
it with me that's from doing foundation
on my eyes look at the crease that was a
product of doing the foundation first
and covering my eye with it
do you like how am I supposed to overlap
it right here it's gonna smear I'm just
gonna avoid around my eye so the
quote-unquote professional way to do
like you know the routine is eyeshadow
first but I do have makeup artists that
do it the other way yeah I feel like a
lot of YouTube bloggers I've seen them
do foundation fairs yeah and normally I
could just take my foundation and like
that's gone you know but no I can't do
that right now
I feel okay I don't see fall off I don't
but I did like I said I was very careful
this time but you know next time I
understand why doing eyes first would be
better because like like Lindsey said if
you wipe it it's so much work to redo it
yeah it's not as bad as I thought it
would be at least you're doing it the
right way I don't know so let's go pull
the office see what the co-workers got
to say do you put your foundation on
first or your eyeshadow on first
foundation my eyeshadow on and then my
better we have a very important question
for you it's life or death I put my
foundation on first I like to have just
a good ice flat face to start from and
then like bit like sculpt my face and
build it out from like a blank canvas I
put my eyeshadow on first now that I
wear a whole bunch of glitter and stuff
I shadow I can't put it on last or else
it over in my whole face I know it's
wrong to put the foundation on first but
that's what I do because it makes sense
you know my eyeshadow I'm not a
barbarian because sometimes it's a
fallout foundation first eyeshadow cuz
I'm not a monster
that's for two years now I am hashtag
team foundation first and I feel very
very passionately about this I feel like
it evens out my skin tone and provides a
nice blank canvas for everything else
go on top and it makes everything so
much easier so if you do your eyeshadow
first you have to like play freaking
Tetris and minesweeper and go around all
the things you just worked really really
hard on there's obviously no right way
to do makeup obviously you can do
whatever works even as long as you look
beautiful and confident at the end but
today's the first I love doing the eyes
first I always have I shadow falling on
the face so I always take a makeup wipe
and wipe it away and then go in with the
foundation I personally like to put my
foundation on before my eyeshadow I like
to start with a clean slate and the
foundation gives you your eyeshadow
something to adhere to I don't think
there's a definite right or wrong answer
to this question I think it depends on
the look that you're going for and how
much time you have I prefer to do I
shadow first but I know everyone else
doesn't do it that way and it's there's
no right or wrong way to do it all right
so what did we learn so there's no right
way
I still think mine's the right way
okay No so as you may have noticed
boldly is now as is but don't worry
you'll still get all the awesome
continues - but just even more new great
