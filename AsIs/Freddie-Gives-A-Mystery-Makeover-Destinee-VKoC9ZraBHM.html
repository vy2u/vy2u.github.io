creep extraordinaire my mission is to
snoop around a mystery persons apartment
to figure out what kind of outfit to
style him or her the catch I don't find
out who they are until their final
reveal
I can only use clues from their living
space to craft the perfect total
makeover in another thing their closet
is awkward so last episode of ladylike
chose our coworker Becky and I gave her
a rock star glam Baker ladylike is ready
to choose another her best candidate and
I can't wait to get my creep on
it's Fred and I was in Hell Creek Jesse
is interested I usually see her wearing
like a lot of like darker colors yes I
would love to see her just like glammed
up a little bit more hi my name is
destiny and today Freddy's gonna be
creeping on me where we going
look at the maps No Oh North Hollywood
okay
my style is very athleisure I was an
athlete pretty much all of my life so I
live in leggings I live in t-shirts and
I live in black I'm thinking this person
is just gonna have a very distinct style
and very distinct interest like they're
gonna go hard whatever they like because
I feel like Valley people doesn't be
going high I think my apartment style is
gonna be a little challenging for Freddy
because it represents where I want to be
but because I haven't decided to settle
in LA I don't have a lot of furniture
but I do have some accent pieces that I
think might help her out
oh is this the building look at this
cute
build a so I really wanted to do this
because I recently went through a
breakup this I'm newly single
I want something to go out and kind of
introduce myself to the world so I'm
hoping Freddy will help me find the new
destiny and bring her out to meet LA
The Creeper is here at the apartment of
the creepy now I've been given one clue
from the director of this episode and
instead the person is a woman so that'll
be great to keep in mind as I creep
through the apartment
but before we go inside and I start to
creep let's talk about the four
categories I'll be using to help me best
style this person category 1 color
palette is she a pastel princess or is
she dark and vampy category 2 aesthetic
as the apartment boho shabby chic
vintage minimalist you get the picture
category 3 textures babies are their
particular materials or fabrics that
stick out to me in the apartment leather
set mesh oh my and lastly category for
favorites
what belongings does she have that I can
use as inspiration for the outfit
hobbies interests
what's she passionate about well now
that we've covered everything I think
it's time to get to creep in
Wow
we have a studio here ladies and
gentlemen okay it's very minimal
I am already distracted by these
beautiful paintings over here so let's
get to creep it I'm excited I mean I'm
gonna have to dig really deep to figure
out how to style this person but I will
say there are three beautiful pieces of
art here that are pretty much the focal
point of the entire apartment
they're super colorful and there are
three women and they each have afros
different sizes different textures I
love that and within each of their afros
there are words written in graffiti font
so I'm gonna get a little personal you
know what that means I'm taking off my
boots I hope she doesn't mind what are
these words urban Pony Oh sex oh yeah
see I'm getting the sense that this girl
is very sultry she loves a good arm be
slow-jam specifically from the 90s this
is clearly the centerpiece every color
of the rainbow is in this art and these
have I mean hold on wait I see the word
leather remember those textures I was
talking about mm-hmm I think I've gotten
enough from these pieces of art it's
time to get off her couch I guess your
time y'all
make up Sephora brand bronzer 50 red lip
so this screams pastel princess but the
color palette of the art in the living
room is much more bright and loud in 90s
and out of control the shower curtain I
love because anyone who knows me you
know that I love gold I feel like we
have that in common
hey girl we hear it's almost like a
geometric pattern tribal moving on but
she got caught
okay so let's take a look at these books
shall we I'm trying to gauge a little
bit more about our interest a little bit
more about what she's passionate about
so she has fire and fury cape verdean
booze as he's on saris book I'm getting
from her that she's very socially aware
very politically aware loves writers and
actors of color which I also do I can't
get over how similar our taste in books
are I mean I literally have these two at
home on my bookshelf a magazine or is
she oh wait a minute
Rosie look at this beautiful rose a
bottle she has I mean this is fancy this
is absolutely something that she should
cherish and keep forever oh you're still
here
so the subject is very clearly into
health and wellness she has these very
light weights nothing she also has this
yoga mat which is a beautiful bright
blue that perfectly ties into the pills
and the art above my head made into the
beds which is quite comfy might I add
this is okay the bed is full of texture
we've got fleas but this is like the
fabrics on the Vera Bradley purses you
know it's like patched patched cotton
and then also behind me this is a
beautiful pink satin pillowcase just
wait a minute what is I'm just trying to
do this right I don't want to get me
clues I'm not gonna open the iPad but
it's also a very soft paint so I think I
have everything that I need I got a lot
of information from the decor in this
apartment we're running out of time the
subject is on her way home so I have to
skedaddle but next stop shopping so we
are going to
forever21 the victim wants a girls night
out kind of look alright well we'll see
what we find
if I put her in a blazer I'll have to
put her and just like a lacy bra let
underneath with no shirt because I want
to make sure it's not like oh going to a
business meeting oh I really like this a
lot it's so 70s it's so Diana Ross see
this is so pretty it's pretty formal for
like a night out to the bar ooh it's a
wrap skirt
I think the velvet is what's making the
green pop even though it's a little bit
darker I feel like these are super
comfortable and the color pops just like
some of the colors in the art also this
is made of like a really soft cotton so
this caught my eye because it is indeed
metallic which ties into that metallic
rose a bottle that she had on display
the only thing is she can mat drop down
and get her Eagle on in this and I need
her to be able to drop down and get
eagle on I think the look that I'm gonna
put together it's definitely gonna be
more of a nice dinner and venturing as
opposed to just going to a bar I love
hot pink I'm considering maybe a hot
pink clutch like this his leather
leather I definitely think I'm gonna go
in the direction of an actual high heel
as opposed to a bootie or chunky boot
now I just have to find accessories I
really want to find like a metallic
clutch like I think that would look
really cute and super tying to that Rose
a bottle that's it
better
okay every single piece in the store or
just like it used to be great for going
out with like big hair what I love about
the store is that the innings are so
elegant but so eclectic
these are 1,000% an option there are so
many different colors like she could
literally wear this with any the thing
that these bright green areas are a
statement is an understatement like they
are like a focal point for sure I think
for someone who usually hangs out and
dresses and like more muted tones or
athleisure this would be way out of
their comfort zone and I am cute for it
the creeper is back and it's Judgment
Day the mystery person is getting her
hair and makeup done as we speak as I
sit and stir in like a penis I'm excited
because Freddie one is very stylish and
I'm getting to try out a new look and
try a new destiny at the same time I
have been up since 4:00 a.m. because I
just have no idea how this thing is
gonna go so I've chosen two outfits this
time outfit number one is a green velvet
dress from a sauce paired with light
pink suede pumps and a metallic pinkish
purple handbag for accessories the focal
point for this outfit will be the
lime-green palm earrings for melody
asani outfit 2 is a loose bronzy dress
from forever 21 70's vibes paired with a
pair of light pink pumps and an electric
blue purse the accessories are going to
be the multicolored drop earrings for
hair I'm gonna do a huge Tracee Ellis
Ross fro based on the women in the
paintings in her apartment and for
makeup she's gonna get a dramatic gold
eye
I'm excited to see which outfit she
picks but more importantly I'm ready to
see who I've been creeping on Oh
this first one makes me feel a little
like an auntie we well Freddie I love
this green dress so I'm just gonna put
on my accessories and get all dolled up
hello it is creepy friend live and
direct right here thank you all so much
for coming out and supporting your
friends whoever he is she's gone through
hair she's gone through makeup she
hasn't a whole new look her goal is to
have something that she felt like she
could go out in perhaps get chose I'm
with you guys I don't know who it is I
don't know what look she chose and
without further ado
yes how do you feel how do you feel I
feel like a snack everybody's been
telling me I'm a meal I haven't seen it
what I feel like a spec so are you ready
to see this on track I am you beat me
yes so this is from a sauce the
beautiful emerald green velvet materials
even though this is a darker like muted
green the velvet texture I think really
makes it pop so let's talk about this
cheese I just like a bad ass pump is
very like Carrie Bradshaw Tracee Ellis
Ross like that was the vibe that I was
going for you know yeah this purse so
let's talk about that a rose a bottle
that you have on display AHA I have an
obsession with rose gold so when my
family and I went to Taipei
there was this he went for New Year's so
of course you had the pop champagne
chameleon D earrings they're very bright
green like the Pops of green in your
paintings but I also just love the idea
of like palms hanging from the ear lobe
finally the pro can you guess where I
got that inspiration from I'm imagining
like Cleopatra kind of away yeah that's
better with it yes Beyonce Foxy Brown
but the women in your painting my mom
originally had this painting and I saw
it when I called turn face time then I
went onto Amazon and saw the three of
them I was like you can't separate
triplets no question for you what did
you let me creep through your apartment
Freddy I'm going to find you a little
bit always loved your style and I was
like it's time to change it's time to do
something new and different
let's ready do it so when I was looking
for an outfit
and then if you wanted something that
you could go out with your girlfriends
in and have a good night have some
drinks possibly drop down and get you go
on do you think that you can drop trying
to get eagle on in this should I
probably not will I not some yes and
that's all that matters that matters
hi girl
we are going
shayla's amazing she looked like a
present she had like those pink shoes
are so cute so much confidence in her
walk and her style
ready did a good job yeah Jesse don't
dress like her hair looks great I've
never seen it like parted like that
before the top you're like wow really
good hair who's really good makeup and
then you're like oh hello little low-cut
dress and then you get down here and
you're like I'm done almost too hard if
I I love the green that green was so
beautiful with a pink to just outfit

together and then me at all it's such a
complete look I'm really proud of Freddy
