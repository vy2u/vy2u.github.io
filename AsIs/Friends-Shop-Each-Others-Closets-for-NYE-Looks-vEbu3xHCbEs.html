it was like from Wizard of Oz so today
we are going to get Neer's outfits for
each other thank you half the battle we
are not going to a store though oh okay
now we are going to look in each other's
closets for an outfit so I will look in
your closet for an outfit for you you
will look in my closet for an outfit for
me every year I feel the pressure to buy
something new for New Year's Eve or
holiday party or what have you I
definitely used to and now I go to
thrift stores a lot so I'm buying other
people's disposable clothing why can't I
just wear something I already have
social media makes us think we can so
there's photos out there people keep
track of what we've worn I'm worried
you'll pick something that'll be like I
hate that dress cause last time I wear
that dress this thing happens I
definitely would get a lot of cheap
items for like one event as options and
I may not wear some of them or I'll be
like one day I'm gonna wear this and
then I just don't I think that this is
gonna be efficient cost-effective that's
gonna be fun all things I like shall we
go
yes please excited to snoop my closet is
kind of forcefully organized because I
have a small room so my closet just it's
it has all of my things
okay I think though for Claudia she's
kind of like like a bombshell vibe Sarah
thinks I'm here to choose an outfit and
really just gonna start things on eBay -
Sarah fans ooh
Sheree this is like this is something
she bought and has never worn
have you ever seen Sarah
she also has this very luxurious like
silk Korova this is probably not
intended for going out but what if it
was though something very skimpy
underneath yeah this is a maybe this
feels like that I don't wear this a lot
what a fun floral jacket but she
probably never wears Wow
you walk in with this people are there
looking at you it's like a very goth
chic situation which is always fun and
loving a shirt it's on years it's up
getting this tracker it might be a
little too informal this is black or
navy am I going crazy I wish this how to
slit so there's some shoes in here in
the darkness
do I want mustard do I want to catch up
okay yeah you know we didn't look in
this let's just see let's see what's
going on it's a secret all right
fourth-quarter decision never know all
right
show something instantly second-guessing
it but we'll see what happen it's really
weird this is a really weird like
sensation it is I feel you closer I feel
closer to you as well I can picture you
home now I had some fun snooping around
your place mm-hm
I chose something for you oh wow how
curious are you ready
it's all ready okay let's switch yeah
there you go okay I guess I'll go change
and the core knowledge it in that corner
so you're like back here in five yeah
[Laughter]
this dress I bought for a wedding a
couple years ago and I usually just sits
in my
closet in a bag and I never wear it how
many times have you went like twice
do you have you ever put these things
together ever nope and I never would
have thought - this is like I feel like
if there was a Barbie of me that like
eight year old me would have wanted to
buy like she would wear this I always
think of this with like a high-waisted
pants or something but it goes together
why don't I do something that I feel you
would have put together or maybe had a
board I would definitely wear this with
the red heels and I'm wondering if I
would prepare it all together
I've worn this before yeah definitely it
does example it definitely takes a
little bit of like confidence to wear
because it's a little more revealing cuz
it has like this this thing so funny cuz
I don't think it's that revealing at all
man
I like it I think that's a beautiful
dress you can just walk off the
obstetrician see ya
bye-bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
