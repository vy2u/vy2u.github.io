it didn't last and it wasn't hate so you
throw the money yeah take three if it's
in lastin it wasn't slimfast
not sponsored I remember my entire
family was like I won the Adkins Diane
I'm checking another slimfast I'm like
oh well of do you even know what that is
what's in that no but like it's really
healthy I saw it on Oprah I was born in
the early 90s so I was not dieting at
the age of five you guys I'm interested
to see you as a pescetarian how you
would have dieted in the 90s with this I
know I'm gonna do the symplast no you're
not what is this I'm not just eating
granola bars for a week it's closer to
her that's not fair you guys are in the
same amount so after some fighting we've
decided which ones we're gonna do I'm
doing Atkins I'm doing slimfast I am so
excited I always wanted to drink the
slimfast that were in my fridge what I'm
almost like that's not for little girls
but their chocolate breakfast and lunch
can be a shake or a meal replacement bar
eat three snacks a day of either
slimfast snack bars fruits veggies or
nuts you then eat a sensible meal for
dinner sensible as in like a side dish
pizzas
nothing is technically off-limits on the
diet and the slimfast website even
feature recipes to make alcoholic
beverages using the shakes what up I'm
doing this for my abuela thank you
it says experts say that it is based on
calorie restriction through meal
replacement so if I'm replacing my
breakfast with a bar i'ma lose money
not if you put gin in your breakfast the
diet you'll be following is known as the
Atkins 40 which means you won't be
ingesting more than 40 net grams of
carbs per day to calculate net grams of
carbs in your food look at how many
carbs it has per serving and then
subtract any fiber or sugar alcohol it
has you are then left with your net carb
I'm not trying to do math while I eat so
I'm just gonna skip that bar you'll be
eating three meals a day - snacks per
day Hey
so overall I just have to limit my carbs
eat as little sugar as possible and try
to eat more protein and vegetables in
place of carbs man I'm gonna be chilling
man I get to eat whatever I want and you
are drinking water this is for hours
hunger control so we are doing the diets
of 19 they are fats and hopefully they
weren't it has 5 grams of fiber which
means that works
Oh 90s let's do it oh look who's
cheating on her Atkins diet
am I really cheating though did you
measure anything there's protein in this
peanut butter the Atkins diet was a
little bit confusing to me a lot of
rules there not a lot of explanation I
don't think this is you know there's a
lot of carbs in bananas I'm hungry
so I guess I'm gonna be winning this how
are you measure your winning
by how much water and power you drink
homeowner my I'm at home in Arizona with
my family and I forgot to bring it so
now we have to go to Target and get some
fast do you remember like what slimfast
was just speed in it shake it like curbs
your appetite right it plates in your
stomach and you go like fix up lat hello
so fast are you there
I see all adkins of what do I do
I'm kind of regretting picking slow fast
when bad kids is in stock and ready and
available
this is Maya's epic adventure to find
slimfast I found it I found it drinking
out of this big glass no I just want to
drink them and go that's a vodka yes but
the best part about this diet is the
snack bars meal replacement drink slam
bam bam replacement J oh man my dad's
making dinner and I just literally drink
an entire I I didn't I found myself
eating maybe too much at night I was
drinking these shakes that were
strawberry in chocolate it made my brain
think that it was not a meal and more
like a snack I got my body suit my sweat
pants up be lips it had a body suit and
so I just put it on I want to get into
the spirits my family probably thinks
I'm crazy
my dog is scared of me Marino so last
night I was super stressed about what I
was gonna eat ended up falling asleep I
didn't even eat dinner now its breakfast
time I'm really hungry I'm here
the restaurant is minoti to love my
cousin Bella
in any of the spread right right do I
want to eat it yes the struggle but I
know Salam is probably struggling on her
Atkins diet and I should check in on her
just to kind of see how she's doing you
know what in the beginning I was so
excited and I was like I got slim fast
it's so easy but I said getting legit
frustrated me too a failure of these
fads is that they presented this with
the idea like drink this shape eat this
meal replacement and you will lose
weight and then in fine print they had
also with the balanced diet and working
out too I wish that I had your diet
instead because I feel like your diet is
more like this this and this whereas my
diet is like I mean this and kind of
this they do give you a list of things
that are healthy but it's really not
easy it's a fad for me it's not rad I'm
so sick of hang in there
high five we did it halfway this is a
virtual hug for storm I'm sorry that
your diet isn't going so well so finally
looking up a lot of things about the
Atkins diet and there were people who
just laid it down and made it like so
easy I realized that some of the things
that I ate for the Kardashian diets
easily been to this side because the
Kardashian diet was like a no carb thing
as well just general healthy things so
this isn't that that I think I ended up
eating a lot of salmon today when I'll
out salmon and roasted tomatoes on it or
grab myself do you remember drinking
slimfast
yes I liked it but it made me poop a lot
so me and Salaam are trying 90s diets
she's trying to Adkins diet I lost 17
pounds on that one
oh my son-in-law cooked for me he would
follow the recipe which one did you like
more are the Atkins because you got to
eat last day of the diet I'm making eggs
that's healthy right I thought it was
gonna be so easy which it was but I felt
really guilty you for taking slim paths
because I know you struggled with Atkins
away I had to count carbs on my own
without you how is it easy
well you just drink shake and they're
kind of
hmm but I feel like I wasn't doing
anything
I need more education with my diet and I
need to know what kind of nutrition is
going into my body and not just
delicious chocolate shakes I wasn't
really thinking about you you know I was
like I'm feel bad for so warm and
struggling she doesn't mean my help
she's with her family would have a
slimfast party's about me in another
state not even though not on your mind I
was out here trying to make broccoli
works when you're trying to eat
differently you really have to go full
throttle with it and say this is what
I'm going to do to work around that
I got quinoa y'all that has a lot
of iron in it I looked at the mutants
back it's tough out but in the end
though she's learned hey look gonna
learning all the things we got through
the challenge are you gonna say we got
through that challenge we got through
that challenge bring on the next one
