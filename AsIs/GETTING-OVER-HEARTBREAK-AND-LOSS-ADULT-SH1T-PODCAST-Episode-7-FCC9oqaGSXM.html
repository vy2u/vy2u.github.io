birthday party I was going to mmm I was
like alright this is a good time to try
it I was feeling a little you know
warning you can say it anything but in
particular get you in the mood grease in
the John Travolta whoa really

real Z hole

freaking hairspray Oh coat yeah to me he
looks like a wax figure IRL oh my god up
baby take me down to pound townn mister
I will not I will not agree with you're
a fool
we should we should actually devote an
entire episode so why John Travolta why
I'm gonna join with you know you will
sorry my body just did that when your uh

literally lights my fire so what about
him made you want to rub yourself um

podcast and knowing those watching on
youtube.com slash involve me with those
people can also go subscribe on iTunes
you may be just subscribe on IDs okay so
anyway so I was feeling like okay let's
go try to let's go try to do it right so
I'm going going and I'm like oh this
feels good and then all of a sudden what
I don't we just talked about on the next
pot gasps I immediately stop by text
calcium like hey so I was trying to
match her me but I got this really good
idea instead which like that I guess is
it just you aren't like focusing all the
way aren't you're I just think I feel
like everything I do I need something
productive to come out of it mmm so I'm
just like you know ways where time
really yeah but if I lady aren't even it
like take little like a little rest or
something I'm like but after this I will
do this on contraire what if
masturbating does do something for you
like oh I don't know stress relief
self-love you're talking about a lot of
stuff that I pay a lot of money to learn
how to incorporate into my daily yeah
you're like I have therapy I don't need
to masturbate dude it's oh it just
didn't happen
yeah uh can I ask how many times you try
a week
no bitch okay I once again came this
morning but I also think
it's like I still feel like we've talked
about this before and it'll come up a
lot come up a lot but like just feeling
guilt for anything like even if I go and
I'm like I do like you know one nice
thing for myself I will feel an
overwhelming sense of guilt for him so I
think that this is a guys I as a friend
just know that I'm in the stands rooting
for you thanks man that's gonna make it
less awkward yeah do it okay dude I just
I think so many people are rooting for
you to come I hate that why it's it
doesn't add more pressure no pun
intended
yes dude no one's ever come from the
wrong type of pressure you might
actually be backing me up
ah oh wait how is your sober Wow
so guys I did 30 days last week last
week was the end and then the night that
the sobriety month was over I went to I
was on a activity with my buddy
it's not a date because it's your
buddy it's an activity just doing things
I can't wait for this to hit the
fan if you go eat two out to eat with
your buddy you're just eating with
your buddy mm-hmm anyways we went
to a bar with a couple other friends and
I had well I ordered a whiskey ginger
and then I was like this is just not the
drink I want to come back to sure I want
wine that's my drink that's brand that's
my staple so I had 300 I don't know 20
minutes and I was drunk as is
god and then I woke up the next morning
and I felt you know I didn't feel
hungover but that I felt shitty that
night because I was I was like oh I
don't like how I am that much when I'm
drunk because I wasn't like paying
attention to the people I was talking to
and they were talking to me and I was
just kind of like in my own drunk head
and then I realize like I think maybe
I'm not that great I'm not as great as I
think I am drunk
yeah maybe all those years I've been
just using
like a buffer to like this is my real
personality yeah people like about yeah
and it yeah your I don't like it about
me yeah I think it's I think I'm fine so
be so so I've decided to kind of extend
the sobriety into dis em December
balance yeah so like last night I did
have a glass of wine at dinner and yeah
like two nights ago when we were all
hanging out I stayed sober we went out
to a couple parties
yeah I did not stay sober no no no Kate
drank and we went on a grilled cheese
hunt Friday night I was like I had like
two glasses of wine and I was good to go
but then and they try to give me a shot
and I was like absolutely not and then I
didn't finish that beer remember I
thought yeah can you turn down a beer
can or Kate left a beer on the table
which alright let me tell you something
kids cuz I know a lot of kids are
listening to this the best the best part
about adulthood is learning that you can
leave alcohol on the table that you
don't there's like a couple of
waitresses listening or like waiters
listening being like um could you
 not it take it's really hard to
carry that full glass back make up my
mind before you buy it
think about how many times you've gone a
little over the edge past like the
drunkness you need to be because you
were like oh let me just like finish
this shot or like let me just turn oh
everyone finish your round like you're
not gonna do that
okay I'll try to it's like there's
something about having like a little bit
more money and a little bit more
knowledge that you know just be like oh
I don't need it I don't fight don't yeah
it's nice but the next night I got yeah
the next night you got but everyone was
like pretty drunk it was a we went to a
friend's house who's also a BuzzFeed oh
yeah whose boyfriend makes incredible
cocktails like yeah hey oh fudge it for
weeks and Freddie and I are just there
and we're drinking it than I was before
we do it we're like where's your party
and then now that I'm gonna go home cuz
I'm sober I texted an entire group Jax
of like 19 people and I only know maybe
like five numbers and it what the
one of my friends started it for a
Halloween party a while ago and we'll
just keep up with it every so often
someone had like we were making plans
earlier but then there was a smaller
group of people going out and they were
texting me but I was drunk enough to be
like
I see them I hear you I'm still gonna
text I'm gonna reply to the whole entire
group so it's just like I'm online I'm
in line okay
oh cool for me when I wake up the next
day and I'm like oh yeah that was a good
but also that's what those group texts
are for at all you should make yourself
feel so bad oh boy oh boy do I make
myself feel bad I have two favorite
things it's me
it's seriously what I'm the best at
I get where you've been but I also I'm
not you so I don't know what's gonna
make you like snap the firk out of it I
know yeah it's hard I like I woke up
then and then I hung out with the same
people that I was with the night before
and I guess to what like I thought this
was being really funny like I like when
people are just obnoxious mm-hmm I love
it was that waiting on me yeah okay yeah
is one guy said set like one of my
friends said something to me I don't
remember what it was and I just went
kidding I was like wow asshole and then
I got Freddie to chant asshole with me
and it was like oh absolutely I didn't I
thought it was probably hilarious at the
time but he talked to me there's days
like today like do something I was like
no no I up a light comes out I
just think I don't give a and then
when I'm drunk and so I'm just like
you you you're an asshole your
tassel everyone's an asshole maybe
that's called projection yeah I hate me
do you want to talk about how we can
hate ourselves a little less this coming
week because of the events that is
happening on Thursday night oh yeah yeah
with the day that this comes out we'll
have our company holiday party which
every year is a big huge event the
company puts a lot of effort in whatever
let's keep going a massive day I mean we
have a great culture here at BuzzFeed
like we have a lot of events yeah a lot
of drinking events a lot of parties
we're celebrate a lot of different
holidays the morale up yeah we could the
morale up and so this is kind of like
the penultimate party of this the year
they say bit ultimate yeah what's the
word pinnacle no I'm not doing it
pin ultimate yeah that's a word isn't it
I think it's a word Siri define
penultimate okay oh it means next to
last so it's not the pen
okay look I'm learning words are really
hard for me I went to public school and
then dropped out of three colleges I
it's one mistake okay you're you say I
beat myself you made with one mistake
and then you're like it's because I
dropped out of three colleges and we're
never taught its impostor Sanjana I feel
like I'm not allowed to use big words
because I didn't go to big fancy schools
I went to one fancy school anyway that's
neither here nor there the holiday party
baby it's happening so we're gonna talk
about things not to do at a holiday
party yeah last off of things that we've
done or I know that have happened last
year's holiday party I think was the
greatest holiday party of all time it
was the company rented out Harry Potter
world at Universal Studios which if you
guys know anything about me and Kate we
like it was a dream country we have no
true Park tours and I really felt like
we got to eat in the Great Hall we got
to ride all the rides as many times as
we wanted so no joke I think I rode the
flight of the Hippogriff like 20 times
in a row yes oh and we're in like these
big fancy gowns and these nice dresses
and just running around Harry Potter
world shit-faced
open bar that's where I made my mistake
yeah let's talk about what you shouldn't
do number one thing you shouldn't do at
a holiday party for sure top on the west
cape what I did yeah so I got really
really drunk and pretty quickly might I
add yeah I was just like oh no line no
problem at one point I was like give me
two and just like drink yeah I can't say
no and you just look at me like I'm
you but then I got like really drunk and
I went up to our boss I'm big very
important boss I was like listen you
know what I'm worried about my dad I'm
worried about him you know like I just
worry for his heart he's getting up
there and like you know is he doesn't
like it you know he just goes through
stuff and he does so much for us and I
just want to make sure he takes care of
himself and he looks at me like what
that's like
I didn't go up and say how are you doing
look I wasn't like you know pissing
around the issue I was just sort of like
listen man let's anchor down let me tell
you about why I'm worried about my dad's
heart oh my god anyhow did he respond he
was great
yes I said yeah we talked about because
it was like I mean I I really enjoyed
that conversation he was like a real
human about it because I was up there
trying to like kiss ass or anything it
is us dude it was a it's a weird night
right when like everyone's on the same
level no one there's no like VIP section
where like the bosses get to say right
you know the interns are there like
there's no power dynamics at a holiday
party which can also be very dangerous
thank God that's all I talked about yeah
cuz I think you uh I guess like I don't
know maybe the number one rule is like
don't be the drunkest person at your
holiday party the same way you don't
want to be the drunkest person at like a
frat party or like a football game try
and always look around to find one other
person that's drunker than you yeah
that's a good second just gonna throw
this out there from experiences I may or
may not have had it me don't look up
with a coworker just don't don't
where you're me because you
might end up dating them for eight
months and having to hide that
relationship from the entire Internet we
never posted pickies light saying we
were a couple when you're on a couple's
 retreat yes you guys went to
Santa Barbara yeah but with other
friends couples a couple whatever the
point is don't hook up with your
coworkers a holiday party because I beg
to differ
here's why especially don't hook up with
them it's like it's been something
that's been like lingering in the air
don't make this holiday party the time
to do the clothes because don't because
this is what we call an excuse to do it
okay if you really want to hook up with
them it's the gift of the season warm
some sort of relationship do it now that
the holiday party do it I think it could
here's the thing ah you know they're not
an axe murderer
hey don't you have a pretty good
idea that their problem yeah 9:00 to
5:00 the guy from psycho had a 95 he's a
really good job and I'm not
couraging workplace relationships
because we aren't workaholics we do
nothing but work so it's really hard for
us to date outside living our industry
 where you eat or don't where
you or listen to Kate or you could have
dessert where you also eat well because
guess what eventually you're going to
either relationships and one or two ways
baby you either are together or you're
not and if you're not well then how you
end well end together okay you either
end up together you don't right and then
you could be an adult about it and be
like yeah but guess what
Kate adults can't always be adults all
right buddy no I'm not all right okay
I'm like I couldn't handle it I'm fine
with making well because in like what
happens if you get put on a project and
you have you know a power struggle or
like you're in meetings or like people
find out like do you really want to be
the the hot Goss of the town of the
office cause of the off he's sorry are
you saying I think just just it's one
night it's one fun oh here's one other
thing I did at the holiday party is a
good lesson maybe in general okay I'll
earn merit not last year but the year
before we had a holiday party and they
had these what I heard were great
macaroni and cheese and everyone was
like oh did you have a macaroni cheese
ball I was like no and then I just kept
going back to the bar getting another
drink and then I was on a hot pursuit of
macaroni and cheese balls for a solid
hour nice running around like had they
been here cuz you were drunk yeah and I
wanted them and you had a commission
yeah and then I realized I wasted a good
amount of the party pursuing these
macaroni and cheese balls and then I
found out they were gone it was fun and
every Kate here's the thing if I had
just stayed in one place they would have
come to me and I don't think Wow exactly
I don't think it's just about macaroni I
think it's also about you know sometimes
things if you're just gonna you know
don't go out find out wait for them to
come to you if it's meant to happen or
go out and then enjoy yourself and maybe
the Mac
roni will come to you maybe and if
someone offers you a macaroni and cheese
ball take it
and lesser your coworker then and I know
your friend likes macaroni and cheese
balls
take one for them I think it's maybe
she's in the bathroom and maybe she
wanted one just have fun don't don't
make it a whole thing about and
still the whole night does not need to
be about macaroni balls who do you want
to at the office no you know
at BuzzFeed this is an HR nightmare but
it's quite funny cuz I don't think HR
listens to this podcast so those are our
tips for your company holiday parties or
your nestling will be things are not
just stay on a buck yeah
now we're gonna answer a fan question
that came to us from Instagram from a
little gal named KC East yeah sorry girl
she okay so I have a question for the
next episode I'm 19 and completely an
experienced never been kissed in
experience I just started dating when
we're not like being open to the idea of
dating how do I hinted guys that I have
no clue what I'm doing without doubting
myself I want to enjoy it but I also
overthink love the podcast it's so
empowering to listen to it I feel like
you're my older friends giving advices
thank you so much a being listen if
there's anyone who really can't help you
baby it's me I honestly this is
something good idea with all of the time
I don't know I don't know I don't know
how to get that like there's a language
I'm assuming that people do honestly and
this is might be really bad advice no
well I think we just have really
different advice on that subject it's
also like just because you're 19 that
doesn't mean anything I mean look Kate's
28 and she's never came there's no a
whole big bag of you yeah I
have a lot of deep-seated issues you
thundergun age means nothing yeah
there's no like there's so much pressure
especially in high school to be like
okay I was the last one to have sex and
get kissed I was 15 but still I was the
last one out of my friendship yeah to
lose all my yeah virginity things like
that
yeah and I mean it's also like everyone
is different you might want certain
things that are different than what
other people want and there's so you
could be attracted to different things
you could maybe you don't really want
someone all that like close to you right
now or whatever just whatever it is that
you want to do go ahead and do that and
I think the thing to keep in mind and
this is something that I really have to
work on myself is if someone's not
interested in you it is a hundred
percent them yeah them and it's just you
know it's just one thing that they're
just like it's just not happening for me
the same way that you might not be
interested in other people I think what
I would do a lot of times is I
really project my own insecurities onto
this other person I still do this and so
even when there's like an opportunity to
like flirt or kind of be with this
person or whatever I immediately am like
really friendly I like call them dude a
whole bunch and like yeah you know like
I just sort of like I get nervous and I
like I don't know and I think I just
sort of sabotage it from the beginning
I would say what I've been told and like
the best advice I could give is just to
enjoy the experience if you're enjoying
if the goal is oh I need to kiss someone
cuz I'm running out of time and it's
dead acutely more and I have to do it
right now then it's not the then it's
not the time it's what it's probably not
going to be the situation's not right
yeah so if you're like oh I'm really
enjoying this person and I want to get
to know this person more and I like
being like close to this person then
enjoy that enjoy and like maybe touch
him on the arm or him or her yes body
language is so important yeah just let
yourself let yourself do what you want
to do without thinking I have to do this
or I can't do that it's not I think is
and believe me it is much easier said
than done
oh yeah cuz really hard i I've just
riddled with insecurities and I just
hate myself at almost every second of
the day they're all so great and also
that's not what I said so what I say it
for is the reality that I live in so no
thank you
maybe one day it'll say it I love you
too buddy but I just think that you are
worth figuring out what you like and
taking their time and it's your own fun
experience and so you don't have the
same experiences as everyone else
alright sorry
and the other piece of advice is more
boob boob it's true I wore this like
this exact shirt because if you well oh
you guys can see it it's a podcast
it's a boobs look great thank you it's a
low-cut v-neck from like Old Navy or
something and I just cute comfy not too
yeah but it shows off your body I'll
tell you what people talk to me way more
because you could just see boobs in it
not saying that that's what you should
do but if you weren't to a man and you
say like it just because I started
really young doesn't mean that I didn't
go through the same thing of like
knowing how to show a guy or a girl that
I was into them but like body language
is super important because I will say I
think it's stupid to believe that men
are the only one that can make Moo's
although it is really scary to make a
move but something like even just
turning your body towards them when you
talk or like putting your hand on his
shoulder or like putting on his knee if
it's wanted if he reacts
weirdly maybe he doesn't know
how to date either being honest about
your situation I wouldn't go in like
pretending you're a dating expert if
you're not like I think God honesty is
so important in the foundation
of just dating in the foundation of just
hooking up you can't honest about what
you want and I think it's okay to admit
be like yeah I'm 19 and I've never been
kissed and like that's fine I mean it's
not something you have to go out on the
first date
yeah I guess but if it comes up oh and
it's okay that if you're like you're not
experienced you don't need to let them
be in the driver's seat because you'll
still know what you like I remember like
I didn't really make out with anyone at
like ever well now I have but I like
when I was first meeting I was just sort
of like hoping that he would take the
wheel because I was like you must know
what is right and they're like I always
thought there was like a right and wrong
answer to all this stuff and there's
just not just what you enjoy yeah I
stand by the it's the old movie he's
just not that into you
Oh pepper would at least 10 years old I
think but it did vice kinda still saying
some of its are a little outdated in
Texas but I firmly believe if someone is
into you they will find a way to make it
 happen it may not be as forward
and outgoing as like they will ask you
out on a date but they will text you
they will send you a funny meme they
will find a way to be in your circle if
they like you even if they are shy they
will do little things and you just you
have to be super aware of it and but
that also goes edge but then you also
have to be someone that is willing to
put yourself out yeah
so I think we also right now
specifically with everything that's
happening I think that if if I don't
actually know who you're you're into but
I just think it general it takes both
parties to be like I'm into this and I
think
but guys right now we're probably like
I'm not gonna I'm just not gonna say
 you know what I mean and that's
fine that's great but that means we have
to be a little bit more honest about how
we feel about them and what we want to
like happen and that means that runs the
risk of being rejected which is
something I know a bunch a battle baby
the fear of rejection is far worse than
the actual rejection it's tough at the
time but then you're like it's such a
weight off the shoulders like oh you're
not interested in me cool don't know
exactly what it is it's sort of like you
have a pain somewhere you're like I
don't know what it's coming from or
whatever but then once you know what it
is you're like oh okay now I know man
you and their metaphors are just so good
thank you and like truly I mean 19 I
felt really grown I felt like I knew a
lot I feel like I had been I had you
know been in love at least ones I had
dated around but like you will have so
many crushes and you will have so many
relationships and I there's this one
quote that's like the person for you is
out there and you haven't even met them
yet also you may not need a person like
you may not might be a couple people
yeah it may be like friends and maybe
it's a pet like yeah I don't need
anything else we put so much pressure on
relationships making us happy
specifically like romantic relationships
and I think as long as you are honest
because the second you start lying to
yourself about what you want it's so
easy to lie to other people you're
trying to be like the cool girl like I'm
okay with whatever and if you're
honestly not okay with whatever the
second you stop being honest with
yourself you're gonna start lying and
getting yourself caught up in situations
that you're not okay with and only you
are gonna end up being hurt me you're
gonna be unhappy communication is key
the guys are saying a lot of things just
was a really good question thank you
yeah thank you and if you guys want ask
us more you can always hit us up on the
twits the snapchats the the Grahams well
I know Chuck a lot I don't snapchat a
lot only for the filters on board I do
what's your snapchat here
go ahead Co is getting over we haven't
gotten over and different ways to cope
ooh we have had time to learn about
things that matter things that don't
matter
I knew believe time heals all wounds I
can talk about like obviously the it's
the first thing I think of when you say
like talk when you mentioned we should
do an episode about getting over things
I was in a very abusive emotional and
part physical abusive relationship I had
a very close friend who she did not like
it obviously and she mate was very vocal
about it and I you know all the reasons
why someone doesn't get out of an
abusive relationship and when I finally
did get out of it I spiraled I had never
been through something like that it was
one of the hardest relationships I ever
had to get out of it wasn't a hard time
getting over it it was hard getting out
of that physical relationship and she
broke up with me as a friend in the
hardest oh my god am I gonna cry I like
immediately like my servers like closed
up but like she left me at like the
hardest point in my life ever
like I was the most down I'd ever been I
was the most depressed I of course
wasn't acting like it I was like I'm
fine it's gonna be fine I don't care
everything's fine yeah and she basically
was like you are ruining your own life
and I'm not gonna stand by and watch it
happen
yeah and to me that was like the biggest
 you a friend could ever do to you
that's a worse betrayal than like the
relationship I had just gotten out of
mm-hm and she was supposed to be the one
that I leaned on she wasn't supposed to
alone that took all my and you know
it wasn't until years later that I was
able to go like no she had to do that
for herself and for you and for me yeah
cuz I otherwise she would be enabling
you like I still kind of have this not
anger like I hope she's doing well I
hope her life is you know yeah and out
for the best but there is a part of me
we'll never like really forgive her I
mean that's kind of just how I got over
it was with time and time yeah yeah
that's I mean that's really hard I think
it's also like when you're hurting so
badly and there's no way that you're
ever like in an abusive relationship
that you aren't they make sure that you
feel insecure all the time I was in like
he wasn't ever physically abusive and we
weren't even in a full relationship I
was just like if I hang around maybe you
know and he was just so mean to me and
like me about you know all that sort of
stuff so I make they make sure you feel
insecure so if you're already feeling
super insecure weirdest part about
insecurity is that it becomes your whole
thing and you actually get blinded to
everyone else's needs and feelings and
emotion yeah I don't when when they're
like you're hurting me you're like I'm
I'm crumbling inside yeah how am i
hurting you how do you not see that my
and it's a weird moment where you
because you hate yourself so much you
can't even possibly fathom that you are
putting your own needs in front of
someone else's but you're also not
dealing with your knees in like a
healthy way so it's a really really hard
thing for someone to and I but it was
really hard for her to to walk away and
that's she thing is like I didn't see
that like there wasn't she was not like
I'm sorry I have to do this like I'm
really hurting - she literally wrote me
like an email that was like I just don't
want to be associated with you anymore I
think you're a toxic friend and I like I
never saw her feel any remorse or
sadness and I think that's why I
harbored so much anger because like a
friend breakup is so much different than
a breakup breakup that's like like
imagine for me just stop talking
tomorrow
that's how sudden and I pull the rug out
from underneath me it felt like but you
know it's been a while I don't know I
could see I some no that's not true I
could I don't think I could see us ever
being friends again that's what's weird
is that sometimes you get to a point
where like oh I can't actually be
friends with this person anymore I think
I really want to the end of my story
I was a disaster I deserved it and crew
from they learn from it yeah I'm a
fuckup
what's your story it's basically I
haven't gotten over anything in my life
I really haven't I like it's really hard
for me to just get over things cuz to
get over it in my head it means back to
good back to good and back to where we
were and we're right back to this place
instead of being like yeah you know and
now we're just not gonna be like that
anymore like there's someone who was a
friend and then this whole thing
happened and now I don't like we were
trying like I could feel us trying to be
friends but it's also like hard because
there is a place where you could hurt
someone too much and it's just sort of
like yeah but I'm just not gonna I'm not
gonna do it again yeah sorry I like that
yeah both of you were sort of like we
were such good friends but too much has
happened yeah I think that what I want
to learn with like getting over things
is how to look at a situation
objectively girl print because I just I
mean it's the second I'm in a fight or a
tiff or there's like disagreement hey I
just like I did this I did something bad
and wrong and it's like even connotation
sucks
it is yes my stomach hurt yeah look I
feel really bad about having talked
about something like a couple podcasts
ago and there was a situation that I
sort of looked at because I was like I
was a thing that where I was talking
about earlier about like I thought that
because I liked this person that
everyone knew you know what I mean that
that they would have to know and then
them not liking me the way I liked them
I was like oh it's cuz of this that or
the other thing it just you see what you
want to see you know and I want it's
this weird thing where I don't want to
do this anymore but it's almost like I'm
so used to being hurt and being alone
and so I just sort of make situations
where that'll be the outcome and even
when I'm like looking at people if a lot
of times they'll see someone I'm like oh
you're really really attractive and I'll
just be like I don't stand a chance like
there's no way I could ever be with you
or like you and then I just get really
in on myself and I harbor all of it
instead of just being like hey I kind of
like you uh so there's that you know you
also did something that was I think good
advice for getting over something it's
like apologize when you're wrong yeah my
perspective on it was very much
one-sided yeah and I think that when you
feel insecure I saw it the way I wanted
I wasn't seeing it correctly I wanted to
be mad I wanted to be like instead of
just be like oh this is unfortunate
first it doesn't feel the same way I
wanted to be like this person is a bad
person and they you know what I
mean like I wanted to be like I was over
here doing nothing you know it's crazy
how much we blame ourselves and also our
victim to our own that we
do in our head yeah our heads are scary
places to be there's a lot of going
on up here a lot of the time yeah and I
could see there like that's what's weird
too is like sometimes I'll say to my
friends like I up like I'm so
sorry I'm such an asshole and I can see
the pain and there I was being like
don't talk about my friend that way yeah
you know what I mean but it for me it's
just it's always been that way growing
up it was just very easy to take on
other people who are around me like take
on their emotions and be like I just
didn't have even emotions of my own Wow
like at all it was just sort of like all
just everyone else everyone else I'll
deal with mine I'll make I would just
make-believe
in my room I would just like act out
full scenes like fully alone like really
just make up whole story plots where I
can get these emotions out and if I
needed to cry I would make up a scene in
my head and I act it out and then I'd
start crying that sounds insane wow so
much effort yeah I'm not well oh no how
else I could possibly say no but like
that you see that like we're quiet I
mean I guess it comes with like you
never have feeling like you had the
right to have your own feelings right
and I would also sort of kind of try to
gauge ahead of time what people were
going to feel so be like instead of just
like asking and knowing what it was or
not caring letting them deal with their
own feelings it was like when someone
had a feeling everyone had to be around
that person was everyone's
responsibility so that's how I look at
them now like emotions and whatnot is if
you're sad it is my duty like make you
feel better and then if I'm sad too but
if you're sad doesn't matter if I'm said
anymore Wow that's yeah that's how it is
so it was interesting too because a lot
of the stuff that you think in your head
is just such
yeah like really yes guys in there like
it kind of ties into another maybe thing
of advice but like forgetting over
things letting yourself have time to
feel things but here's the thing here's
the thing
the truth of it is that I walk around
with those thoughts constantly it is no
surprise to me that I can't figure out
basic flirting and basic human
interaction because I'm over there being
like right man we're gonna start sagging
we're gonna start taking pills how are
your knees like this is what's in my
head they're just sort of like this
music huh you're like I think I'm a
 nutcase walking around be like
let's analyze that where are you coming
from who was mean to you in your
childhood did you have anyone whose
depend on but like at least I get I
can't stop saying at least you're honest
about it and like maybe you just need to
be a little bit more outside a little
more vocal to whoever you're dealing
with you know piece of hair it might
actually be on my lip no it's not oh
just kidding I mean I get it I didn't
get it I'll you I got it I'm
 god sorry guys I really needed
to take care of that it looks good okay
let's talk about like romantically
because I know we have definitely
different experiences okay yeah that uh
I've been broken up with a lot oh I've
done breaking up a few times but the big
big ones the big heartaches have always
happened to me and I think it's a
combination of even when I knew it was
time to leave I didn't want to be the
one that did the breaking up so I would
have rather been hurt you've been just
taking responsibility so then that gave
me a lot of time to be sad baby
oh she liked being sad for a while the
biggest most devastating breakup I went
through I laid in bed for five days
taking xanax and sleeping and so much to
the point where he sent his friend over
to my apartment to make sure I was still
alive because I wasn't answering my
phone I wish I would have done what
everyone always says to do I
wish I would have blocked his number
unfollowed him on everything and just
taken time to like mourn
relationship because I kept throwing my
hat back into the ring that he was not
accepting and I kept being like well let
me try it this way let me do this thing
maybe if I post a sexy Instagram or like
sometimes yeah take a trip to Vegas and
put all that on the Internet maybe
then he'll see that he wants me back and
like none of it was working yeah and
instead of just being sad and
like doing all the motions of going out
with your friends talking about it until
they're hating you going to eat
like there's like the steps of grief you
were you were in denial for I think
that's kind of important too is like not
which and guess what you're pretty but
it's like the stages of grief and who's
to say how long one should last you know
what I mean that's what you are in you
way that there's like it takes half of
the time the Sex in the City says that
and it is right
I held on in like love for years yeah
and we only did like eight months six
months like there are people I haven't
gotten over that I haven't dated but
truly and then there were people that
like I got that I dated for years and
got over immediately because I mentally
was out of the relationships months
before we had actually broken up and it
is a change of like lifestyle it is it's
a loss it's grief yeah I read this thing
on Instagram it was really beautiful and
I took the time to even write it down in
my journal because that's how much I
loved it and it was like you are going
to have rage when you see him on the
internet you are going to be sad when he
finds a new girl you're gonna wonder if
she makes him laugh the same way you do
if you have the same little intricacies
if she wears the sweater that you always
wore when you were cold you're gonna
remember the best the way he made you
laugh and wonder if he does the same
things to her and like you basically
just like how much you will hurt but the
thing you won't remember is the coldness
and the reason why you didn't like the
relationship or the reason why you were
actually sad you will you will you will
idealize all the really good moments and
by God see all of that but don't you
stop living like you can you
can absolutely walk around being so
 heartbroken but as long as you
are still walking around you are still
winning there is also a real sense of
clarity and that that heartbreak you
know what I mean I know what I like what
I was I wasn't even dating the guy but
like the he was so mean to me he was so
mean to me all the time but he also
showed me the type of attention that I
like wasn't me on getting anywhere else
and that'll be who and that was like the
first time I had felt that and so I
needed him to be the meanest possible
way to be like I just needed him to be
super mean for me to just fully
like separate for a little while I was
like I missed his arms which is weird
I'd know it's you and then after a while
I was just like oh wait what a piece of
 I don't miss him at all you just
miss - yeah I like the attention I like
there were certain parts that I really
did like he was like yeah yeah
everyone's all bad right but I think
even Charles Manson I'm sure had some
good qualities no I also feel like you
were talking about time and getting over
things like that I think that um I
wanted to just touch on this we were
talking about grief so I'm in my
hometown
we lost like a lot of friends at
different times - like different things
whether it was like a car accident or
like an overdose I remember when my
grandmother passed away it was very
sudden like she wasn't old and sickly
like she was fine and then she just
passed away she was like my best friend
so it was like I was shocked about that
but even still I was like but it's a
it's a grandparent right like that's
what they do and then when it started to
become like my friends and my you know
my just different things happening to my
friends it makes sense that I'm
constantly worried about death and it
hurting because I never really thought
about it before and then I thought of
like how scared everyone must have been
at the time like right before in terms
of like getting over that I remember
like going to my what look he was
younger that makes you like my one
friend's funeral or his um his wake and
just like seeing everyone there so sad
and like yeah crying and he was like he
was 20 and um I just remember like
having that one moment like once we all
got back and cuz a bunch of us like went
together and once we all got back in the
we were just like we've got to do
something together like let's go do
something fun so we like went to this
one place back home like climb this
mountain the Stars and stuff but I think
that one of the most important things
about that type of grief is I hate when
people say live every day like it's your
last cuz that's exhausting and I feel
like it's also a recipe for anxiety like
I'm gonna borrow you know and that's
like really hard I have a really hard
time like yeah leaving people I
constantly think someone's gonna die
like it's a really really hard thing to
go through but I think that the the
important thing is to appreciate what
you're feeling when you're feeling and
appreciating the people like around you
at the at the time sometimes we not
something you will really ever get like
the loss of a friend or like the yeah
yeah a friend versus like a parent or a
grandparent or a parent like it's
different than like someone your age and
that like could have been you or you
know yeah I mean I don't know I don't I
wouldn't know I couldn't really speak on
like a parent the grandparent like that
 me up but um it was it was still
like enough removed but then when it
yeah when it was our age it's also like
I was there I was there it was just that
I was there and I felt like I could have
reached out one you know like I'm ooh
that's like the guilt stage yeah yeah
you don't know what other people are
going through and you don't know how bad
it is and I think that's like important
to is that and I get like really off
 now I'm gonna cry okay I feel
like there was a big chunk of time like
I feel a lot of grief over the fact that
I've missed out on a lot of stuff and a
lot of like human connection because I
was so I just there are times when I
could have been closer to people that I
lost mhm and that sucks
and it wasn't even that that got me to
like go to therapy and stuff I just but
now I'm like realizing how that really
like impacts you yeah like yeah don't be
a dick to people like yeah and
appreciate the relationships you have
like be you never know what
someone else is going through but also
like it's a balance right like you said
it's exhausting to be like this big
 emotional thing happened whether
it is like the loss of someone
physically or emotionally you know what
is like that sheep who you are and it's
teaching you things about yourself like
you it can affect you in every possible
way the way you now will interact with
other people the way you will form
relationships there are of course it's
also like that feels to me like yes that
sounds you're right that's the positive
way of looking at it but to me I'm like
 no I'm not gonna figure out how I
can be better because I like they're not
here why do I deserve to be
better they're gone they're they're gone
they missed it I would like to learn a
lesson from it and whatnot but it's
still kind of like it just feels weird
even though I know it's right and it's a
good way of looking at it there's no
wrong way to feel what this kind of
stuff yeah like you're allowed to feel
every single one and that goes for any
kind of getting over whatever it is
you're going through like yeah there is
no wrong way to do it because what
you're doing in that moment is what's
right for you you see how frail
everything is a lot of the reason with
like relationships I sort of steer away
from it is handle it I don't like yeah
no one likes loss well they say it's
better to have loved and lost than never
loved at all I don't suck and believe
that there's no you guys love
tears people apart it can ruin it can
ruin the way you look at life everything
is a mess we're all gonna die
one day which to me is really comforting
think about what I mean here's how I got
to be terrified of death terrify the
thing that gives me the most comfort
about death and if this makes you
anxious sorry but it helped me get over
my anxiety is that you don't remember
anything from when before you were born
mm-hmm it was just black it was just
darkness you had no consciousness
consciousness and conscience you just
harshest miss yeah you weren't aware and
I feel like there is going to be that
comfort and peace whenever you do die
and it's like you're all you're worried
about something that you're not gonna be
worried about once it's over I truly
believe that like whatever does happen
when death does come for us all
inevitably that it's gonna be a sense of
comfort like it's gonna happen we have
no control over and the more we try to
control it the more anxiety
it's gonna give us I think that the one
thing that I'm learning with all of it
is that no matter how no matter what
you're going through you try like I'm
trying to take a step back and realize
that it's not as important as connection
with other people well it got morbid but
when does this podcast not ooh baby baby
