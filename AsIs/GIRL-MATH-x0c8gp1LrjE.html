and he only texted me first three days
but I waited two hours and he only
waited 20 minutes how long did you say
that he waited to text you back only 20
minutes and you waited two hours will
sour okay so if you look at the
half-life of a text it's actually a lot
more significant than the amount of time
that you text each other first so really
it looks like you're out even I think
you're saying so and I told my algebra
teacher I'd never need back hey Jake in
Eugene yeah what's wrong they look great
they're 10 so I'm usually not in double
digits you know what are you usually
like an eight okay but remember two
weeks ago Macy's when you bought a six
the average of ten and six is two names
no I I mean I think you've got a cute
it's like three times your age okay yeah
but his daughter is half my age and his
second wife is only eight years older
than me so really in terms of where we
are in life I think we're pretty
compatible don't be so judgmental you
probably has a ton of money so Julie
thinks I'm sleeping with too many guys
that's absurd you don't even sleep
around that much
well my numbers kind of getting high
okay this is what you do close your eyes
take the number of men you've slept with
divided by the number of years that
you've been having sex what's that
number a lot better yeah okay exactly
you're the girl you're fine a bun Jerry
right I'm gonna have kids soon but I
don't know I think I'm running out of
time don't be ridiculous you have plenty
of time yep okay watch so you want to be
finished having kids by the time you're
35 so if you want three kids that's six
years total of child-rearing good now if
you take that original age of 35 and
subtract out six that's 29 now that's
the age that you need to start having
kids at the absolute latest that means
you want to be engaged by 25 you want to
be dating at least a year before you're
engaged usually so yeah 25 minus 1 is 24
are you a 24 okay great</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
