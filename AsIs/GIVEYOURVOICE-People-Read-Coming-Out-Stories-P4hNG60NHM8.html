out
okay I'm 20 years old I'm gay and I'm in
a loving relationship with the man of my
dreams I know that if I come out my
family and many of the people I've grown
up with will disown me I know people
like this the sacrifice of my personal
silence for my parents pride is worth it
watching other people come out makes me
happy and gives me a sense of hope yet
at the same time it hurts that I can't
bring myself to do the same that sucks
because this guy is like trapped
he's like completely trapped I have a
friend that's really close to me that
can't come out because he's scared of
the same thing so that's bad hits really
close to home and it's too bad because
they're a wonderful person and I want
them to be happy I'm 20 and I'm from
Florida
I only realized that I might not be
straight a year ago I watched season one
orange is the new black three times and
had no idea why I liked it so much um
full frontal nudity within like the
first 10 seconds of episode 1 season 1
had that same experience when I was
watching American Pie 2 when I was like
13 years old then one night after I had
a dream about a girl I woke up in the
middle of the night sweating and
stressed out and I started crying that
day I skipped school and work and stayed
at home and watched every lesbian movie
on Netflix I haven't come out yet
because it scares me I care a lot about
what people think about me I've had
multiple people ask me if I was gay
before I've always denied it this is
hitting close to home though for real
it's a lot harder when people ask you if
you're gay before you're ready to admit
it not only to yourself but to them I
know my parents siblings and friends
wouldn't care but it's still really
scary it's a process for everybody so
you have to respect that they're even
acknowledging the fact that they know
their parents siblings and friends won't
care I think that this person is in the
possible situation from 17 from the west
coast and have known from a pretty young
age that I wasn't a boy but I wasn't
exactly a girl either it was really hard
growing up around people who constantly
put me down for showing interest in
anything related to being feminine my
friends and family all made fun of me
and called me a that really wore
me down
I would wear dresses sometimes once I
borrow from my older sister that you
looked better than them than cheated I
also landed me in some broken bones
they'll pick on you if you're not
wearing a dress they'll pick on you if
you are wearing a dress or just wear the
dress I don't want people telling me to
pick a side already but that is just
confusing to them I just want people not
to call me a girl or a boy because I'm
not those things regardless of what
people say to you you are beautiful I
just wish I could come out without being
scared of my identity being valid to
some people I think it's awesome that
your sister is supporting you and honey
wear those dresses I totally hear you on
not wanting to have to say because it's
just who you are and you have the right
to be true to yourself so just keep
being you at this point in my life only
a handful of friends know who I am
I've known that I'm bisexual for a while
I mean surely if those people on TV were
brave enough to come out I could to
write any hope that I had any dream that
I had where my family would accept me
for who I am soul is starting to
disappear as a parent that just makes me
sad that I wouldn't want my child to
think that she couldn't believe it she
couldn't tell me anything you know I've
never been so terrified in my own family
I'll never come out not for lack of
wanting to me because if I do I'll lose
my family
I'll never come out because my school is
full of straight people who mercilessly
bullied the last kid who came out
I'll never come out because I've read
what people write in the comment
sections of a video because people think
I'm disgusting I don't get to come out I
can't
oh my gosh that's I hope the world
changes enough the next few years for
this person to feel like they can't come
out you hear stories like that that
people's families don't accept them but
then to actually read it from someone's
point of view it's just so sad</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
