don't know anything about periods it
comes out of this area
Tampax pearl triple pack
okay so there's light regular and super
so that has to do with how heavy the
flow is okay see I've never open this
before I've seen this in like
commercials literally no idea you like
but I don't understand why like it's got
a oh oh I still don't understand why
does that I don't know what you do this
thing goes into your vagina pulled that
out and then it's just like dangles for
the rest of the day so you can gank it
out when it's done this is a I mean a
tam pad these are maxi pads oh these are
great
always they do the same thing as tampons
like you want me to pull it in this is
like a diaper oh these are huge I don't
know which way I'm assuming the Georgia
O'Keeffe painting right there's where
you target it you just fiddled it like
this why is it sticky oh so you don't
keep the purple on the non sticky side
just like lays gently here I would stick
this on my vagina because it's adhesive
maybe put down a little talcum powder
you know but yeah I've heard of the D
 up it's like a green way to deal
with your period revolutionary
alternative to tampons and pads I wish I
could put my penis into the cup but oh
wow I don't know what is this I don't
know so you shove this in your vagina
zoomy compress and then let it expand
inside
like that and I guess you just dump it
out this is probably what Marie
Antoinette used adjusting a little gross
I don't know a lot about feminine
hygiene products and I feel like I
should do a little research so I'm a
little more educated because who knows
one day I might have a little girl</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
