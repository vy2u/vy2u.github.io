feel like there's maybe like a lot of
cats around and we're gonna knit scissor
tough and each other up
yeah scissor a little blast is ring Oh
dancing K guys dance a lot like a lot of
thrust and I'm calm please Carol
lactose-intolerant I mean if they really
want to be accurate like they could just
watch the love scenes from the l word
but then none of the rest of the
episodes will be going to my house I
don't know what we're doing yet the
lesbians have to tell us just ladies
night at a popular gay bar can I get
mozzarella sticks you can get in
hey we're gonna do so much better than
the lesbians at this we have some really
tall orders for them smile stare I can't
get a stranger for one minute here we go
wait which way am I going
we're starting off with wine got the
wine and curlies late as always what is
currently doing all right we're doing in
there I know 15 minutes later do you
want it to be cute or not we do okay I'm
just plating it I'm awfully as a lesbian
would we were like curious do you like
go to that much trouble every time you
hang out so what happened let me accept
that who brings it back back to it love
a lesbian so butch son he's like I'm
actually probably crying
we're talking about our pets now talk
about cats and we pretty much made it to
lesbian to third base get that
parrot girl can we sing that word
parrot I hate that
20th you did but you've been drinking
white by now it's kind of oh I can see
it a little bit
my last boyfriend is you to be cheated
you cheated yeah yours is really because
he's a salvage asshole vodka sodas are
gross yeah you don't have to be a
lesbian to know that Jenny's cancer
thrown with her wedding day mr. Wright
is well someone they didn't quite
expected I'm guessing it's a woman then
the other choice it's called girl trash
yes five chick loving chicks had one
night to duck a jam jam with the band
and bed the girl by 2:00 a.m.
we accidentally picked a music hole this
is really offensive to me this is so
painful what is going on Regan I know we
watched the worst movie and the history
of lesbian kind on to burgers burgers
hotdogs and eggs oh my we're done
because I love you funny we yeah it was
really nice to kind of just talk to one
another and watch a terrible movie snow
bears we managed to have a lesbian night
and also a gay man's night we stayed out
until 11:30 I was in bed by midnight I
thought gays do it better no I'm not
coming to your house with some cheese in
a movie let's go out I feel like if we
would have taken it there I would have
like hung like I could have done that
but I got to do lesbians get out of
your damn house see the world party
would not do something they could have
had so much fun with that meat and
cheese plate yeah we had fun so we won
put on a tank top and get out there he
allows them as ones love their less
