if you like somebody chances are they've
already dated like three of your friends
and we're gonna find dates for each
other we are going to swap dating apps
I'm excited because I'm so single her is
a dating app that specifically for queer
women the interesting thing about women
on apps is I feel like you just talk to
them forever and then you like never
meet up hey the whole talk oh I love
talking literally an option on Grindr to
say that you're looking for like right
now
Oh reinder it's an app that basically
just like helps you find other gay men
based on proximity like send a picture
of their dick and then be like top or
bottom and then you're like so I'm
downloading her and you're done lying
right there bad boy fill proper toppers
this means beautiful save him for later
even just the setup of this something
could actually come up this like people
I could fall in love you better find me
a girlfriend I'm gonna do my best try
and find someone who's actually looking
for something I'm gonna find that

to love a blessed
grinders already not working on my 4s a
little bit it's been loading more men
for quite some time
and I've started setting up an account
on her and I'm still like picking out
the pictures and like five girls have
already tried to chat with Brittany I'm
like it's not even done yet
does it make well this actually looks
good yeah yeah oh yeah visit into Asians
oh my god but saw somebody arias like
ask you that wait he's not even Asian
what what we are experiencing now is a
box chewing his chin and they'll just
try to get you like give them your
credit card information or something
just got home from work and Brittany
already has 49 girls trying to Joshua 49
I haven't done anything I just created
the profile I haven't even started I'm
exhausted so I had to pick a tribe for
Jameson I picked Joc I'm like I wish I
was like a sweet job option cuz he seems
like a really sweet job I don't know why
he likes even a Letterman's jacket
no no clean-cut yeah I put myself as
clean-cut
it's been really hard because as soon as
I don't give someone a nude on Grindr
they usually stop talking to me like
maybe after the third lie of like what
are you doing
it would be like pigs so a lot of it was
really based on appearance which makes
sense because they wanted to meet up so
lots of opinions about her after day two
some people they like requests to chat
you and other people send you a friend
request and I don't know if that's like
an actual friend requests or like code
for something else
almost every single woman on this app is
a vegan or vegetarian and that's what
we're bonding over and then I have no
idea what to talk about after that
so it's noon
and I'm going to start talking to men on
Grindr four Jameson there's like no
interesting conversation at all and I'm
sure on yours you experience like women
like wanting to have conversations okay
girls are just very nice and forgiving
from my experience on her like I get
busy at work and I won't respond for
like seven hours um and that's okay to
that and they still want to talk to me
girls are really nice like they don't
call you ugly or fat or tell you to
off
so this one girl had a photo of her with
a bunch of geese I literally just sent
geese in capital letters and we like
started talking about geese and then we
started talking about other things that
were interesting I'm really into her I'm
really excited about this we've been
talking the whole week
she's totally my type and we're about to
exchange numbers and I'm super excited
yeah she asked for her number so we made
sure it was totally fine I'm gonna pass
the buck off to Rachel yeah I have a
date ah I don't have any dates on behalf
of humanity I'm really sorry that this
is what your experience has to be
neither you'd be greeted with like hey
or it would be like picture picture
picture picture of like their torso
their ass their like dick and Assad
they're like hey what are you doing I'm
like oh I'm bored at work what about you
and it's like butt kick and they're like
wow he's like a sensory overload there
was too much potential to kind of just
like weight room there's nothing like
lesbian dating I think it was fun for a
little while and then people wanted to
talk so much that it became like almost
a burden if you like lesbians always
like complain like oh like I can't find
they're all on her they're a lot of fun
and they're all ready to talk to
everyone we hung out I had a really good
time our personalities totally clicked
super cute we made plans to see each
other again she did look exactly like
this girl that I hooked up with before I
think I have a type</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
