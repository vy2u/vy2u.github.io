right mom
now you do the chains of dictatorship
nor the fetters of oppression can keep
down the forces of freedom for long that
sounds like someone's trying to get in
my pants I'm in safety guy this is so
powerful I hope it's a woman they can
bring us freedom nothing can bring us
down and that's why I think it's a man
females are a group that have been
oppressed okay never mind
I teach a man series a woman mistakes
were made and I'm responsible for those
mistakes since when has a man ever owned
up to anything
males have made mistakes I've heard this
quote before by a guy this is such a man
mistakes were made honey babe I didn't
mean to put my dick there too big to
fail is still too big a problem so it
even mean you know I'm here to make a
statement I'm gonna make it right female
I'm gonna go with my main man Bernie
Sanders I really have no idea why it was
just completely guessed one of the key
problems today is that politics is such
a disgrace good people don't go into
governments this is just so negative and
men get away with this there aren't
enough good people in the government and
she's a good person she belongs in the
government I kind of feel like that's a
trump quote so I'm gonna go with this oh
god no please no let's not know he can
really carry a TV show it is the
hypocrisy of liberals that enrages me
the most
this is Donald Trump because it seems
like oh I'm talking down on you Ilana
seowon said that homegirl seems a little
bit salty
her last name makes it sound like she'll
be mad all the time this is a country
for of and by the people not for of and
by the government I'm going to say male
they're like this Chloe's a girl male
right to be honest though tell me the
only thing that ben Carson has ever said
that made any sense ben Carson what were
you thinking
yeah I do think different genders think
differently but it shouldn't dictate
whether you can lead politicians are
politicians whether they're men are
women it goes to show we should judge
politicians by what they're advocating
for rather than if they're men or women
get educated people because politicians
scatter future men and women in politics
sound exactly the same it makes sense if
you don't think about it just like most
of politics</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
