wild so I can't picture that it'll look
normal I've never gotten a spray tan I
haven't changed that dramatically ever
in my life so be interesting to see what
I'd look like with a different skin -
I've always wanted to be tan because
that doesn't really happen for me I'm
expecting to book orange and maybe match
the color of my hair I doubt my views on
spray tans will be changed I think
they're kind of goofy maybe I'll be
pleasantly surprised so evident spray
Canyon with our solution have to cut
minutes longer and it connects them out
a little chilly we got a little Sun back
here a little bit cosmetic bronzer
sitting on the top of your skin right
now will run sighs oh did I mention I
want to like below second position how
many days is this going to last five to
seven days I have to seven days this is
a lot safer for your skin then it's
yummy yes I feel most uncomfortable just
exposing my armpit this is crazy
watching the color just spray on and I
see the line between the hands and the
not game and I can see the difference
yeah
you are all ready to go there can I just
put my regular clothes back it's always
weird at first there's this sticky layer
all over you and can stain your clothes
my shirt got covered in the bronzer
afterwards and I think the inside of my
pants did too is kind of like getting
sunscreen put on really I went and laid
at the pool for a few hours and only
didn't put sunscreen on my stomach and
my legs and they are bright red it
didn't look far from what I'm used to
seeing whenever I do get tan which is
not often it's definitely the tannest
I've been just a general like I will get
tan sometimes but this is the tannest I
think I've looked before it was very
dramatic like the next day but oh yeah
you can see definitely very very white
looking in the mirror like the next
morning was pretty crazy I just felt
like I was like dunked in chocolate
pudding my armpit area there's
definitely like darker spots here yeah
it's starting to fade where my watch is
this is kind of weird but I felt like my
nipples we're too pink for the rest of
my body a lot of people said it looks
good they were like oh wow no it looks
natural I don't know I might consider
doing it again for me personally like
the amount of stuff you're like not
supposed to do when you have it make it
not worth it yeah it worked well but
there's nothing wrong with being pale so
I don't think everyone needs to be tan</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
