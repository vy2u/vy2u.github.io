everything that they like her each of
the boyfriends and girlfriends secretly
submitted costume ideas to Lindsay and

their choices let's bring out the
couples Tyler being from the East Coast
does like to dress preppy I used to wear
like the lobster shorts mom is very
concerned that I'm going to make him
into like this like a weird bohemian guy
I was thinking it could be fun to see
him in something more like hipster II
also I know his mom would have beef has
a very casual hipstery look having dated
you I've upped my shoe game for sure
Steve look I wanted him to have sort of
an Italian model chic white blazer any
jeans all the things that Steve would
never be caught dead wearing like
clean-cut basic not too complicated just
like me definitely more the fashion one
of our relationship like he's into like
whatever Kanye's hurting yep if he
always wears tight pants and it's it's
got to go I chose an Aladdin out Aladdin
is the hottest Disney character hands

of clothing yeah if you dream outfit for
a night out I guess I didn't really

move Wow look at this guy I kind of like
the son of any Italian restaurant owner
