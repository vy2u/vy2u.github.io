kind of pull anything off and make it
cool like he put something together but
this and then suddenly it's like almost
an outfit she likes to get dressed up
and look cute what she does but I don't
like to wear any pants that have a
zipper I really like elastic waist
there's one thing you feel so confident
in it and but it's cheap it just grabs a
lot of attention I think this will make
room in his limited allowance for
clothing or a new friend to appear in
our lives
Oh fun I'm having fun now I'm scared and
I'm not deep she dug I feel uh pretty
jittery because the thought of having to
go buy a new shirt and or underwear
pants or something just wasted money
wasted time this shirt it's your
Christmas vomit shirt look at what he's
wearing and how cute he looks and how
blue his eyes look and now look look at
him and Christmas vomit it's top of the
Christmas Mohammed
it's beautiful everyone loves Christmas
these are pink pink leopard lady's
pajamas they're forever 21 I think
getting rid of this shirt will open up
some room on a hanger for another button
up that will be a good date option I
said I love this shirt
tension grabbing flashy flashy ladies
pajama pants that maybe don't need to be
worn as pants you want to give it a
final farewell maybe one last sniff oh
my god even smells like me
I feel really guilty I feel really bad
so it's amazing how one piece of
clothing has so much symbolism behind it
apparently there are aspects of me that
are too much I think a lot of a
relationship is compromised and it's
being nice to each other and not
stepping on each other's feelings and I
think that is all good and valid I think
every once in a while to just open
Pandora's box just a little bit and let
one little demon slip out and kind of
have some mischievious fun I think
that's good for the relationship</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
