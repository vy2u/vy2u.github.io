doing boys night my mind merely go to
places you're going to a strip club or
we're gonna come together we're going to
be men we're gonna bond probably playing
video games Oh lots of video games I
also think that it can be code for
trying to get someone late or three your
unlabelled friend is so sexually
frustrated that he just needs desperate
help to get Li dumbest things you do can
be excused cuz it was a guys night or
like a boys night boys nice absolutely I
feel like boys night could be anything
most of the time it's just them going
and getting drunk I think that's all of
it we got you now I think you eat and
then you poop and then I think you're
like ready to go you're like free I'm
sorry I feel like guys all the time
I should admit good sneaks yeah simple
super simple super simple five words or
less yeah five words yes yeah it's like
Twitter it's like super short it's
either a joking question like they're
literally pretending to be a girl asking
about their outfit they're like I just
my outfit look good and the guys are
good look fine and then they're like God
or the worst is when they get a
sarcastic answer like no you look
terrible and then like wait but they
can't ask again they get clarify you do
a cool on girl tonight I mean there's so
much value in just having it be girls
one of us we're not letting guys come in
and hit on us in fact when they try be
kind of resting bitchface them away I
feel like a boys night
it's about no girlfriends it's not about
no girls guys are never like I just want
to dance tonight like let's just go out
and boogie that's what I want to do know
that you put a vagina in there you just
judged all the props as you talk about
their feelings contrary to popular
belief oh yeah I feel like it happens
end of the night they're wasted there in
a taxi and it's yeah man my
brother you know I love you vanilla
segue into their live just Katie you
know Katie is killing me and
that's it you've broken it and now it's
about Katie and your mom and you just go
on and second grade all just all these
motions and it's all you needed was just
the moment someone was drunk enough to
say something sincere to you
feelings talks are gonna happen it does
seem fine to lose a friend on guys night
where it happens on girls night you're
pure panic like she's dead in a ditch we
gotta find her we believe net with guys
I couldn't really care you know your boy
all of a sudden disappears you're like
two hours you're like well I'm just
gonna go home and I guess I got day

that he went home with the girl he was
seen talking to last evening I got so
everyone it's like if a guy's lost
forever

the end of the night and they stay up
