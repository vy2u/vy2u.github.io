definitely is like a thing that people
have or they don't have I wouldn't say
I'm good at flirting I am excellent at
flirting
I contact as big it's like the first
intention of like I'm kind of into you
someone like starts to turn their head
away but their eyes stay looking at you
you don't want to look like you're just
like staring at them and then they're
gonna be like doing something on my face
smiling a lot smizing if you will the
key to flirting is to making the person
feel like they're the only person in the
room the movies has taught you that like
you do a little wink and like you flip
your hair but I would never do that
you saw how awkward that was like what
is this does that do anything for you
and then I'm like okay maybe I should
stand more straight no they're gonna
think I'm too tall no okay when I'm
flirting with someone my posture is like
the best that's ever been like my ballet
teacher would be so proud
I'm supposed to like have my chest out
and just like hi oh this is what's so
funny about having small boobs is like
I'll still do it but I'll feel dumb
doing it because it's sort of like and
here is my necklace
touch is like a really great like easy
flirting you just kind of put your hand
on their shoulder I do a lot of hand on
the small of the back which is typically
a guy move but I feel like usually it
comes off as like I'm trying to like
grab their ass so I'm like yeah and
they're just like whoa girl
texting is definitely a large part of
flirting so less is more though when
you're first texting with someone aloof
is key I think emojis are really flirty
where she's blowing you a heart kiss
poop emoji boom thinking of you the
smiling poof the little smirk face
really yeah I just said something dirty
what are you gonna do about it
the ghost keeps them guessing and also
how cute the peach emoji is the sexiest
one for sure social media was invented
to flirt in my opinion that's all I use
it for casually liking one or two photos
he's gonna post one he thinks is like
everyone's gonna like don't like that
one but two weeks later he'll come in
with the like when he only has ten push
it to 11 you'll get married if I were to
give advice to someone who is totally
clueless about flirting I would say
welcome to the club if you're awkward
and weird be awkward and weird and it
will be flirty in exactly the right way
I just like go for it and just be direct
there's such like a stigma for girls
that you should make the first move in
that way or go up to the guy but the
worst that could happen is they turn you
down and that's not the end of the world
make your flirts have some sort of end
game otherwise why are we on this bleak
earth I'd rather regret something I did
do than something I didn't do
so just go do it
I'm sure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
