have a computer you could just take your
shirt off and like no one questions that
dudes like can revel in their farts I
feel like I would like that peen
anywhere is really just a possibility
you can't even be in the car and have to
pee and and work it out oh we have to
like breastfeed oh my god don't even get
me started on reproduction you don't
like push out like an eight pound larva
from like the lower part of your loins
how did you work out with that yeah you
you have a penis so that's really fun
there is apparently like an orgasm gap
and girls don't like it off as much you
got a boner and things are gonna be
happening pretty easily for you in out
boom that was great they don't have to
worry about lingerie it goes up your bum
bum crack and then you have to worry
about that and then you can just do what
you want and then you leave you're not
gonna get pregnant guys can drink more
than girls which is not fair I mean I
would love to drink as hard as a guy can
if they get like too wasted they don't
have like six girls waiting like behind
the bar to like take advantage of them
usually what they say is what they mean
Rose will be rose I feel like it sucks
for guys because there's so much
pressure to like not be emotional you
died earlier not having boob plus balls
are really annoying
girls are probably really stressful for
guys
