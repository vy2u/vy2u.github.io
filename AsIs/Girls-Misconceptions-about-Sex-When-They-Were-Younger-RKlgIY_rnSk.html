thought it was some kind of secret club
that only had a couple members like
including my parents and some movie
stars
I knew it involved my vagina I didn't
really know what a penis was I really
didn't understand how it inserted so I
felt like they just kind of laid on top
of each other and things just happen I
actually make my Barbie's do this I
would make ten its bargain vagina I was
sure that was something adult did and I
didn't understand which hole like I'd
not until high school did I find out
that a girl has three holes because I
thought there were I just didn't really
think about it cuz that's a weird thing
to think about if you put coke up in
your vagina after having unprotected sex
you wouldn't get pregnant
also if you had sex standing up you
couldn't get pregnant there was like the
Catholic myth that if you masturbate you
go blind and I once had a theology
teacher who said that in class and then
look directly at a girl with glasses in
fact said I had to do a report on
scabies so I grew up thinking that that
was a real threat in the world of
penises I would encounter but so far no
scabies when I was about 13 I had a tape
dedicated to share Michelle Geller
interviews when I went to go watch that
tape once my brother had taped over half
of it with porn I was eight years old
and my dad left a basket of girls gone
wild videos next his nightstand I went
to a birthday sleepover and the birthday
girl like had to come across this porn
video was like guys I have this big
surprise and she turned it on it was
some woman and derogating this fan and
she had very large breasts I didn't like
find it or stumble upon it I downloaded
the r.kelly porn video it was like
roadkill where you're just like no no
hmm no but it was excited and then he
peed on people and that wasn't the one
that I watched she came into the room
she like locked me in a room with a
slideshow with STDs and it was just like
you know this is what will happen if you
have sex you will get all of these don't
do it your body's a temple we were
watching some movie
girl comes to a Jeunesse I'm her mom
like the birds and the bees so I turned
to my mom was like hey are you ever
gonna explain the birds and the bees to
me and she goes are you having sex
tomorrow and I was like no and she's
like then no and then walks away that
was the only text talk I've ever had
with my mom
kids aren't necessarily aware of the
active stacks that early young age the
kids are like aware of like sexy stuff
pretty young I mean look at any Disney
video everyone's breasts are heaving and
like men are just like like rusting and
it's like very sexual awakening</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
