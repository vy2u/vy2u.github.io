me feel so good and made me orgasm like
14 times happy tears I once cried
because I bought the wrong cookies I
once cried over a Swiffer Sweeper
commercial I felt bad for the mop I once
cried in class because I gave someone an
accidental paper cut one time I cried at
a One Direction fan fiction I am NOT
proud one time I cried when I was on my
period because I thought a guy was being
too nice to me one time I cried for like
three hours straight because I couldn't
spell my name while I was drunk when I
was a kid I once cried in church because
eternity in heaven sounded so boring I
once cried because my boyfriend ate my
cheat day sandwich it was really
traumatic one time I got so high I cried
because my family went to get Chinese
food without me one time I walked in on
my parents doing it I was so traumatized
I cried one time I beheaded a bug and
it's bodyless head kept trying to bite
me and I cried one time I cried while my
boyfriend was going down on me I don't
even know why he was being so gentle and
loving I'm so weird one time when I was
high I cried for hours because I forgot
how to tie my shoes I once cried because
the chocolate I was eating was so good
I hate periods
