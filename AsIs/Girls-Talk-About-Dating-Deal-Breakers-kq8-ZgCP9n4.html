anyone I've ever met Gabby has none and
that's a problem well I thought it was
like dippers great tender miss hell on
earth where all your hopes go to jock
talking about your ex two months 30
seconds side but if you keep talking
about it's like I'm your date not your
therapist guys who chew with their
mouths open oh this is horrible I had an
ex-boyfriend who I would consist we be
eating and I'd be like please close your
mouth if you text during the date no
rude rush your teeth at least twice a
day if you don't do this
you are gross no smoking yeah if I
wanted to make out with a cigarette or
attendee I would just do that that thing
will kill you if I don't kill you first
that would kill you guys it's been like
I can't even do it because I would never
do that
I've never gotten why that's just like
an okay thing for people to do yeah
deal-breaker
Crocs Steelbreaker and hard he'll
breaker looks like he drives a
motorcycle but doesn't guys who wear
this pastel shorts fast on shorts really
don't do it for me who do they do it for
I'm trusting guys you could also
describe as unstable I like a tall rich
guy nothing original about it but it's
been working for everyone for years look
women love stability it's science
we like guys out there together it's
sexy guys who have bad grammar anyone
that uses the wrong like your oh my god
the wrong where's the wrong where's
Michael do that oh absolutely
if you're against nicknames I don't want
to date you that's not fun this is why
sex the city has like misled me so much
I thought that when I got older their
eyes would be like hey pop-tart how you
doing I was like oh good but like no
guys call you pop tart you need to call
girls pop tart it's a cute ass nickname
if you're super stalker I topped it
every now and then but who talks about
everything we're done they sit down and
like immediately complaining about their
long day
now we're like talk to me but I need to
talk too much that's my thing I don't
like someone who needs me as their
entire social life
he was constantly checking in about what
I'm up to I'm confused because I'm all
those things I once dated a guy and I
was like he had so much time for me and
then I realized he had no friends he
needs to have a social life because what
happens when you go out with your girls
you don't like it when women are
obsessed with you but you like it what
venerable divas meter ladies are scary
guys like get too handsy like they're
just kind of like all over you
so you like grilled cheese okay
someone's will do thirsty guys that
don't get tested they're probably hiding
something guys that are like very hyper
masculine yeah so I got a nine-inch dick
what you gonna do about it nothing I
think people can come up with all kinds
of deal-breakers and then when they meet
someone their pheromones take over and
it doesn't matter I mean honestly we
never follow the rules there's a lot of
silly deal-breakers but I feel like
there's places to compromise when you
really like someone grammars not silly
if you have any big significant
disagreements about how you want your
lives to play out feel breaker unless
you're willing to compromise then you'll
be miserable like the rest of us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
