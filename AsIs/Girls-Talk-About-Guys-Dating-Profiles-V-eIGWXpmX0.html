weight are you like a beef stock that
I'm gonna buy I am a big fan of dating
apps if you're bored it's fun you know
it passes the time
I am currently dating the guy that I met
on tinder I feel like they're necessary
evil a lot of times I would use dating
apps like late at night if I'm bored so
the fact that I can lay in bed while
dating is really appealing to me don't
even think about messaging me if it is
just one a fewer just wanna you know
ride that pony anything about your dick
I don't care about your day he was
attractive but then in a self summery it
just says extrovert what I pick you up
in my boss ass he'll Sorento if it's
like a dorky math joke or something
nerdy I'm kind of I dig you go is that
dangerous and I go get but I like danger
I'm gonna like the profile I think you
owe five to you
I wish guys had more personality in
their profiles just be who you are I
like people that are like
straightforward with their intentions
you know if you're here just to do the
nasty then say that so that I know guys
that have photos of them like hugging up
with like two chicks you're like you're
trying to say like see women like me I
am approved by women if every single one
of your pictures is like in a group and
you don't actually show yourself
especially when it's like it's your
first profile picture like it's the
first one that pops up and it's just
like a group of guys what I'm not about
to sit here I figure out which one you
are and what are you hiding like is this
guy gonna make me laugh like if you have
a funny face picture like that's cool or
like a picture of you doing something
that you love is cool hiking and
whatever jogging running tennis
basketball if the pictures are clear if
the pictures look like you have a lot of
interests or hobbies like mixing up the
photos and showing you like there's
versatility in your life
pictures and BIOS that can start
conversation I wish guys had more of
that I need to know that you don't think
you're too cool so we're all on the same
shitty boat it's globalization man like
we can meet people all over the world
that we never would have met before
just like ride the wave it's fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
