photo shoot I have never considered
doing peanut before they used to have
like a lot of really pretty dresses with
the big full skirts and everything and
that is more my style but I've actually
put on a lot of weight and since then I
just basically most most of my wardrobe
is dedicated to try to hide my body I'm
quiet androgynous and when I think of
pinup models I think of quite them
identifying women doing something like
this I really wear tight clothes ever so
I'm kind of nervous about that aspect
because I'm too I was confident with my
body it's going to be a bit of a
challenge in that respect but I'm
excited about it let's go for it
so Sasha how do you decide what kind of
looks to give women well I think the
most important thing is to make that
decision in line with the sort of person
that we're working with and being
sensitive to the things that they feel
about themselves and particularly about
their bodies I would never wear makeup
this is like kind of nerve-wracking in
that in that sense I'll push you too far
out of your comfort zone just far enough
I'm a little bit nervous so just
wondering if you have any tips for me
everybody feels really nervous yes the
only advice that I have for you is just
enjoy all of it I can't be present yeah
and hopefully you'll discover some new
things awesome thank you
I'm so excited to see what I'm going to
look like and whether I'm going to
recognize myself or not but hopefully
it'll be a big change they've covered up
all the mirrors there's like no
reflective surfaces around so I have no
idea why face looks like I've no idea my
hair looks like anything Oh dad I'm
feeling a lot more relaxed than I was
this morning I feel really good at the
moment I feel like I'm more nervous now
than I was before I'm not used to having
my hair or face touched in any way yeah
that's alright are you ready yeah let's
look yes I'm really ready nervous no
whoa oh my god oh my god Wow I guess
it's just the outfit of someone who's
just outrageously confident oh my gosh I
look so glamorous I've got this like
little Johnny Depp curl here so pretty
it's nice wearing something that shows
off your actual shape and you get they
forgotten what I look like momentarily
that was so much fun I feel great I
think the great thing about my look is
that it's completely opposite to
anything that I would ever wear but it
affects your attitude because it's kind
of unapologetic that's really fun to
play with and it just kind of shifts you
out of your own mindset I think you
sometimes make these rules for yourself
in your head like oh I don't wear these
so I don't do that but then you kind of
forget why I'm feeling really good I
don't know what I was so worried about I
was so nervous and so close to not doing
it I actually feel really good and I
probably feel more comfortable in these
clothes than I do in my normal clothes
as like we saw today there's not one
book so it kind of fits for everyone's
body and really complements your figure
no matter what your figure is I want to
dress like this every day and I would if
I could afford it and like people would
laugh probably laugh everywhere I walk
down the street but whatever I won't
even care because I look so amazing what
I've taken home from today is that I
maybe need to stop wishing that I was a
size eight and wishing that I was less
curvy more flat chested because I'm
never going to be a model in a magazine
and that's fine because there's a whole
different style of clothing that suits
my body much better I think this whole
experience reminded me that any kind of
identity any kind of body shape any kind
of gender can do anything the hell that
they want some women such as myself
don't necessarily like to accentuate
their shape and that's okay and that's
what I did today I used what I had and I
was comfortable in the clothes that I
wore but it was still a lot of fun and
it was still something that was really
out of my comfort zone at the same time
I would just say to anyone that wants to
give this a shot and woman doesn't
matter anything in between to just go
ahead and do it because it's just a big
old performance realize that you are
amazing and you are beautiful and you're
a certain shape for a certain reason</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
