was a child I don't read it I've written
for Cosmo obviously effect with some
things maybe to work a little think it's
gonna make me be sexy in a way that I'm
not usually sexy and positive it's gonna
be wrong pull your hair loose from a
ponytail holder or clip we can watch
your touchable tresses fall around your
face you know if I could like force it
to be slow mode and well lit but he paid
attention I think it's cute when girls
do that like do things their hair you'd
honestly have to be like hey focus on
this watch where I'm going to do in a
second that kind of kills it I could not
pull this off in a cool way
have you seen like any any good movies
lately your hair smells nice looks like
a really great leg I would I would I
want to blurt it wow that was incredible
in the winter you're blushing a little
bit though thank God your hair didn't
smell bad oh yeah I got it was like no
I'm saying you can do a lot of things
I'm just saying that might not be your
move Thanks nothing about it was subtle
but it was effective while conversing
with a cutie lean in so you're about six
inches from his face linger for three
counts then slowly return to your
original position what is accomplished
like a breath check if you can like make
their heads spin about like what is
happening then they're more likely to be
intrigued by you a lot of counting at
the same time so yeah actually at a
really nice busy day today I
what was that
it's like a weird like kiss blue balls I
like it I like it when you're close like
that it went from like oh she likes me
are we gonna kiss this is great oh now
she doesn't she moved away
rub your shoulder like you have a
painfull Creek then gently sigh not only
will he find this extremely sexy but you
might even score a massage that was my
mood in college I think that works
epically well how many times that I've
been like if I sleep with this person
he'll just rub my back and that will be
great
and that's all you want this is teaching
women to just not be honest here's the
thing I hate massages whatever painting
your neck don't rub your neck that was
definitely right how about yo um I did
like aerobics do you want some like icy
hot or something actually that'd be nice
yeah I mean sure there's a drug store
get some don't think it went well he
offered me icy hot and then told me
where I could go by first thing I'm
gonna think of is you should probably
get that checked out I'm not going to
offer them a massage use your tongue to
get that last crumb off your lips while
eating dinner with him okay I happen to
know a lot of guys who think that one
comes on your mouth it's not sexy here's
my question Cosmo how do I get a crumb
on my lip about looking like an idiot
ooh it's like what would happen in a
movie or like a porn soon as that crumbs
on the lip came over I look like I don't
know how to eat like an adult are you
sure you don't want any yo I got it no
what it yeah I got it
so weird would I be that the crumb with
that that's I like it could have been
sexier the thing to do maybe is that
someone else that you're flirting with
has something on their mouth and then
you go like that grab his ass on your
way into a restaurant know that's sexual
assault I don't think men like giving
their bus grab you like be kind of
careful of getting men super turned-on
in public right cuz then that's kind of
uncomfortable for them good laughing so
how did you feel when I grabbed your ass
it was playful it was fun the kind of
the a scram you like that love the
aspect just on the way to a restaurant
you haven't even kissed yet
anywhere you turned on them I think
grabbing my ass in is completely
populated restaurant with work I would
try absolutely none of these again I
don't think there needs to be many tips
we're kind of easy so you can't just
like follow rules and then snap snap
snap that person loves you that's right
me I wouldn't really take these tips of
heart but if you want to grab my ass in
the middle of restaurant you can me if
you're a woman trying to pick up women
you should probably just be like for my
ex-girlfriends friends who has the most
cats that I know and then from there
that's how you flirt your beautiful
woman just sit there Lea cute Oh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
