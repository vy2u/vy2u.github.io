woman's bulletproof vest
I have heard of waist training but
mostly just on the internet and
Instagram I follow a few of the
Kardashians and I think women have
always wanted to get that like
coke-bottle physique
I don't think waist training would be
that popular if the in body type
right now wasn't an hourglass figure I
think the message that Kim K and all
those other people that love to wear
waist trainers are sending is that this
is the ideal body type or this is the
body type that a woman should strive to
have it's talked about so casually and
then when you think about it it's like
something to take super seriously and
make sure you're doing it the right way
mmm actually kind of heavy
I could see it affecting my breathing
though this is like tighter than Spanx
am I supposed to be able to do all of
those class by myself every day I'm
ready to get my Kim K on figure out what
a day in the life of Kim Kardashian is
like remember that it's basically
encasing your abdomen in a vise so if
it's too tight it could put pressure on
your liver and spleen and your stomach
and your intestines especially when
you've eaten that could cause belching
it could cause reflux and pushing acid
into your esophagus which can cause
damage eventually you do not wear it for
more than one or two hours at a time do
not wear your waist trainer if you're
doing heavy strenuous exercise and
remember it's not going to permanently
alter the look of your waist and it's
not going to help you shed pounds
it's bright pink like why is it so
bright so I've got it on literally my
hair up I'm sweating so bad so here we
are day 1 so I have it um as loose as it
can go right now and I'll probably just
keep it on for an hour while I clean the
house vacuuming and stuff
I think exercising and this would be
interesting because even just walking
sometimes like just having my heart rate
up a little bit it's just like it's not
uncomfortable it's just a really weird
feeling of being so sucked in I'm
definitely not physically perfect
posture breathing is a little bit more
difficult some things we want to burn
not sure if there's been any changes or
anything in my waist it's getting a
little easier to wear this thing I'm
also getting very frustrated that I
can't sit comfortably or lounge-y all my
belly button pitched earlier and I did
not know what to do trying to get
underneath all of these like hooks and
whistles is crazy
since the packaging says this is ideal
for exercise or some like that
I'm gonna try and do some movement I
guess okay so I just did like maybe 30
seconds of very light working out and I
just wanted to throw up the whole time
it's not really inhibited me from like
eating in any way I feel like I have a
girl on perpetually you know I was never
able to get it on the very last hook I
feel like it would take me a while to
work up to that last hook and I don't
really know if I'd want to get there
after a week of wearing the waist
trainer I actually lost an inch and a
half on my waist but I do think that's
because I was being a lot more active
while I was wearing it there was a
slight change in my waist size I'm also
doing another video where I'm trying to
cardio bar and I feel like that had more
to do with my waist change than
listening know the waist trainer did not
change
the size of my waist the waist traders
definitely a little tricky to get on it
didn't hurt to be in it like I didn't
feel like it was pushing my organs
together anything like that when I was
wearing and it didn't allow me to take
deep proper breaths I did salsa dancing
in it and it wasn't as like hard or
difficult as I thought it would be I
could tell that it was helping with my
posture I do not see how the Kardashians
or blac Chyna can get the bodies that
they have solely from wearing this I
think there are probably better and
healthier ways to achieve the look you
want to achieve
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
