to run a movie like a video store yeah
why not because technology has
progressed to the point where the video
store comes to you that's all I ever
wanted yeah but going to the video store
was so fun you'd get to talk to that guy
who always had super cool taste in
movies and he'd make awesome
recommendations plus he always let me
keep it an extra day yeah because he
thought you were cute I think I get
terrible recommendations like bad cult
horror movies and also he loved charging
me late fees
I hated that okay how about this let's
go to the grocery store we pick up some
dinner and we go to that that box thing
Carol I love you but I'm not going to
the box nothing ever looks good so we
end up renting a documentary about the
mating habits of fish or something ooh
this looks interesting nope
what's that happened once it's not that
bad it's cheap but it's not worth the
fact that you have to dodge the guy who
wants you to sign the petition for his
friend or you awkwardly run into your
boss when you're taking a sick day and
to top it off we get hit with late fees
and I'm done with late fees it's 2015
okay forget the DVD rental machine what
if we just went out to see a movie
there's nothing good playing and I also
hate it when you're at the best part of
the movie and you really have to go to
the bathroom if we watch a movie at home
I suppose rewind or even watch it
tomorrow if I want to I never miss
anything okay I'll give you that nobody
likes missing part of the movie but hey
you have to admit that movie theater
popcorn is much better than this
business here this popcorns perfectly
fine and we got pizza and gelato also
you we always finish the snacks before
the trailer is done at home we got
snacks on snacks end of the movie people
are constantly talking just having a
conversation
nothing important what are you been
watching anything let's just pick
something right all right I heard
Mississippi grind is pretty good no I
really wanted to see slow West
I don't know I'm not really in the mood
for Western I'll pay for it slow West
yeah I did want to see that sip some
snacks for the movie</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
