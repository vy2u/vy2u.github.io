him one time one day it was like no no I
know well I'd been married before and I
didn't think I was really good at it if
you guys had online dating when you had
met do you think you would have used it
or do you like meeting people I don't
think so person on your personal mentor
sometime
definitely not no no why dangerous when
you're taking somebody out on a date do
you think that the man should pay on the
first date
I don't know one little big thing
old-school yeah do you think the guy
should pay yes well he would be the one
that asked me out I wouldn't ask him out
okay if he asked me out he's you've got
a page so in a lesbian relationship
aka my life who do you think should pay
pay for your own pay for your own I
actually have a rule if I like if I go
on a date and I like them I pay for them
if I don't we split it so when someone
is in a relationship what do you think
they should introduce their significant
other to their parents yeah when you
start dating them yeah which today yeah
first date first day first day got to
get their approval you think an ideal
first date for me I should bring home
the person and have them meet my mom and
dad immediately yes yes and I'll be
there too
you'll be there too after so many years
of marriage how do you keep the magic
alive it's very important to understand
each other
take your time maybe invite you to have
a dinner date date
you're on date date nights what when we
go out to dinner really yeah
I never hear about these things lose a
lot of a shootout here
what just be careful don't don't do
anything to hurt yourself like slow down
when you drive for her and for him don't
lie to each other you have to be nice
person each side for you and I'll show
you if you had a nice person you keep
your relationship forever do you think
you should wait until marriage until you
sleep with somebody yes really
old-fashioned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
