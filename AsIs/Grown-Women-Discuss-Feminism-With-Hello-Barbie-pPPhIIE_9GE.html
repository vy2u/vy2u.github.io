it all
which breakfast did you say okay I think
that I think that says a lot
I would think Barbies a feminist she's
had a lot of careers throughout her life
how do you feel about the wage gap
Barbie I love it
once in a while I catch myself dancing
sometimes for no reason at all how about
you do you dance anywhere and everywhere
Barbie do you know what second wave
feminism well cereal sounds delicious
I was wondering um what do you think
about Sheryl Sandberg oh you know what's
good a dream diary this is so weird
I'm over it justice okay like it again
how do you feel about the fact that we
never had a female president you know
what I want to talk about - I don't want
to talk about fashion with Barbie I
think we have different senses of style
she has permanently raised feet and I
wear these types of shoes sometimes I
get a little nervous when I tell people
my middle name I'm really glad I told
you that's my middle name it can be
really fun to play with Barbies I like
you Barbie I feel like we we're gonna
rise through the ranks together and you
know be like high ranking career woman
at anytime I can help you out just let
me know cuz that's what friends do oh I
have something I want to ask you about
fashion Oh
working on a story that expresses when I
think fashion is all about what you like
to hear it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
