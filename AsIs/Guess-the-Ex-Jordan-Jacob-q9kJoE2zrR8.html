incorrectly you lose one point if you
guess correctly you get a point I
wouldn't say that communication is this
person's greatest quality that's me you
are correct
I'm not a good communicator she's
getting better though this person is a
bit like a car alarm
very loud very excited but after
repeated exposure you just kind of stop
paying attention that's correct you can
stop it very loud breaking up with me
via Facebook message did confirm that
you have zero balls that's me
I've never done that one so I know
that's lovey correct
a long time ago we've already been over
the fact that I'm not a good
communicator this person was really fun
to be around and constantly made me
laugh and smile how I am no it's Jordan
Oh God now the nobody has anything nice
is humpy this person constantly bites
their lip when they're turned on yeah
that's me this is one of the most
selfish and self-centered people I've
ever met in my entire life that might be
me probably it's me decides we can split
the difference
I think it's me though it's Jordan yeah
you're not selfish I can be selfish I
know some people that would claim I am i
what who said that no Jordan
congratulations winning the game of
guess the axe how do you feel about your
victory I feel great about it I had a
feeling I would win but also we're
apparently both terrible people all
right guys thank you for playing and
come back any time I don't think I want
to do that no no</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
