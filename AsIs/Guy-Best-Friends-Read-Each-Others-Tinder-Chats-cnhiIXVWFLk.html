girl asked me hey what's up I'd be like
eating pulao or sitting on the toilet
when you look at your old tinder
conversations you often find yourself
going like did I just I said that I'm
pretty sure is like what his tinder
church must be like even I know what
kind of a guy you were I expecting much
but I don't know what his angle is
exactly when it comes to approaching
girls half the girls on tinder at one
point of time just like no hookups
and I mean I you here for cake you have
a dog to move amazing skills with the
dogs dogs dogs for the window so the
best conversation starters yeah I see
you're a Coldplay friend so she says yes
I saw them live at Wembley Yohan says
what a waste of money they're terrible
now do you think Tinder's for honesty I
dunno how many times I said you sure I
love Justin Bieber no no no no one tells
a girl okay you wanna ask me what I do
do you still like her dog you're not
doing this to Ella I told you I told I'm
not too good at this go-go's I have to
go now
NYC nice kyoool really fine aesthetics
of your face appeal and aesthetics you
know that word that's good enough
but spellings hey so my tinder is really
weird and it doesn't show me your
messages when you send them to me girls
like oh damn and Sharon's like let's
talk on what happens to a girl I don't
use whatsapp
who doesn't you watch stuff so they
don't try to cover over the actual
excuse and that's when you told her we
should watch master of none together
this Sunday the she replied saying is
that before the whiskey or up and Su
made as someone who never misses her
here it depends on how much you want to
see the show so you go south Majesties
event ended up in a spelling at the exit
so you're a first order was that like so
your unsaid it means no money and no
life
Johan no honesty on window I think I
find it very weird how shy you are on
tender clearly how he works his magic in
day-to-day conversation there's no
translate well to this app just try
being yourself okay just just don't lie
or lie in a way that people will believe
you and if she says do you Jim
say yes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
