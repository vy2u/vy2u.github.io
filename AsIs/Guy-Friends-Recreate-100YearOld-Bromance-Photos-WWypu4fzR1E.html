been friends since kindergarten we're
like best friends we have brunch on
Saturday we did we met at a bar um three
years ago your friends are trying to hit
on my girlfriend 2004 2004 in film
school so that's 11 years ago when I
take pictures I do a lot of pointing to
the person that I'm with something like
this yeah I think the last one we have
I'm like this well yeah that's right and
I have one of the same thig we don't
shake hands we don't hug this elbow is
far too much the most very touch each
other this guy's prom date didn't show
up and his best friend was like oh
you're home yeah hey come sit on my lap
okay I kept a string okay what am I
supposed to do in my arms right there
yeah that's close oh I'm like doing this
there's like grabbing a piece of that
guy they're both grabbed that guy's
grabbing him hard too oh yeah do you
still have to take a piss
no cuz your weight is mostly on my leg
and not on my bladder Leah but if I
shift over okay we were laying down like
a Netflix series right now yeah I mean
I'm just gonna fall asleep you pick
whatever you want
I think they were just playing leapfrog
outside the barracks and someone walked
by and said hang on I gotta get a
picture you guys you're a park ranger
and I'm the cowboy who's rad yeah it's
kind of like a yoga thing this would
actually be tabletop oh I would get down
here you can toss me like this is
hilarious if people came into a room and
saw like this
I think you get lots of the immature
comments or they think it was kind of a
gay thing to do I don't think these guys
are gay be together just it didn't
matter buddy this really does look like
summer boys they got too drunk at the
end of camp what are we gonna do we're
not gonna see each other for a whole
nother year
oh we're getting down to our underwear
I'm gonna keep my clothes on yeah I'm
Pro clothes I'm ready I'm like this are
you kissing me I feel in love I feel in
love too
I don't know if they love each other or
not I don't know you know it's fine if
they did it's funny they didn't it does
seem more than just bromance seems like
full-on romance did people really pose
like that though back then give a word
just as smart and just as as hip and
stuff but I think there was there's more
of an innocence you know think about
when you were eight you took pictures
with your friends I'm like hanging all
over each other okay pal look at this
yeah we've made progress seems cruel
that back a hundred years ago dudes
could just like lay all over each other
and be like all right we'll see you Fred
have you had these articles that dad
bought is in there yeah gosh about the
time I'm up here you're holding my hand
which one am I</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
