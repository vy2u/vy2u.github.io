at your body naked
we invited three pairs of friends to
come in and see each other naked for the
first time however one of them will not
be naked they will just be wearing their
boxers it's prank time honestly I don't
care it people see me naked or if I see
people naked it's just like whatever who
cares generally I don't have a problem
getting naked in front of people like
I've been skinny-dipping a lot like with
friends and he's really gonna care about
presentation and it's gonna allow me I
think it's gonna bow oh don't say he's
setting up such high expectations now
now I feel like I have to wow it agreed
agreed that like we look each other's
dicks and mentally we add another two
inches yeah at least it will either I
think as closer together or it will
drive a wedge between us from which
there is no recovery there might be some
sexual tension after this if it was just
me judging you if you just took off your
clothes I was still wearing this robe
that would be so awful for both of us I
would hate that but the fact that we're
both like dipping into this together
we're both gonna feel equally exposed
three-two-one dear oh dear obon cold so
cold i reveal and we're gonna be three
to one
gotcha three three two one oh my god you
bitch
he's underwear on that's so not
fair
take those I agree with you Oh
three two one go yeah yeah there we go
two dicks they wanted me to prank you by
wearing boxers so I pranked them I'm not
gonna let my buddy leave his dick hands
yeah exactly
nice by the way that's cute I was also
going to remove my boxes after we left
 I don't believe it I don't
believe it was he actually it
it it the traits next to carpet the
carpet of course they do haha okay there
it is yeah why are you shaking are you
nervous of course
so are you only thing though sometimes
small lately it's kind of a little
baby's bottom you don't really have
nipples I do I can't grow a beard you
know I can't you know every once in a
while I'd like to feel what it feels
like to have that full chest of hair
I've always wanted to be bigger on like
my shoulders in my arms so I think
you've got that but you don't have the
chest hair no Chester that's interesting
that we both want something we don't
have
I'm so sorry I put you through this it's
all right man it's all right guys easily
I never thought I'd be as happy to see
your dick I think it goes back to like
guys being afraid of being perceived as
gay if you're like being naked around
another guy and it's dumb
it's amazing to me that like so much of
masculinity is attached to this one
spongy boneless thing that we have on
our bodies just be more confident we all
have such weird bodies just be
okay with how you are it doesn't really
matter it doesn't matter I feel like
girls probably see each other naked more
than guys right cuz like girls are
probably like you know having sleepovers
and they're just like it here's my
fitties</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
