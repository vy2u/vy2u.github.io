cried over a girl before breakup suck
for guys too
I'm a man and I cry at night because I
have no one to hold her talk to I saw my
totaled car being towed off to the
junkyard I cried I cried watching Harry
Potter I cry when I hear beautiful music
and I'm not talking a few tears now that
 pours down my face and the worst
part is I'm a guy I'm a man and I'll
admit that I've been on dates that were
so horrible I cried sometimes I dream I
could be in a good relationship but when
I wake up I always cry I started crying
from the intensity of the orgasm she
gave me I love cats so much that
sometimes when I'm holding them I start
to cry had a dream I couldn't find my
sister one of my biggest fears
I cried in my dreams and woke up scared
looking for her one time I got a weird
FBI page on my computer and I cried and
told my mom I was watching porn and now
the FBI wants to sue me it was a virus
I'm a man and I love my girlfriend of 10
months so much that sometimes I cry
because I'm so thankful to have her in
my life I cry myself to sleep because I
can't see my kids the amount of time I
want when I see those soldiers
homecoming videos I cry like a baby and
I don't care who's around I'm a man and
that's so precious to me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
