so girls start getting ready around 2:30
they start getting ready at about 9:00
a.m. at the latest moment possible but
the hair is easily wrapped up in a towel
for good three to four hours almost like
it baking a turkey you know how do they
do that every girl in the group tells
every girl you look pretty and Facebook
Twitter Instagram hashtag girls night
out there with their girls and unlike us
they truly care about each other and
want to be with each other the
transformations made to be is just that
it's beyond me it's I don't get it
that's art you ladies are artists
whatever you're wearing when you show up
to the rendezvous point you are not
going to wear by the time you're looking
girls don't enjoy wearing heel they
don't and I comfortable they enjoy the
outcome of wearing heels and then they
complain about them hurting I know some
girls though that man they'll slap on
some Burt's Bees and be done none of the
places where I go girls don't ever go to
a chill environment you'll never catch a
group of girls out just bowling ladies
just find a place that replicates their
living room but with other people in it
upscale bars where the cheapest drink is
$13 they at least have structure and
they put thought into I agree guys are
like look while we're gonna stop vodka
drinks tequila shots what's like has
alcohol in it but doesn't taste like
alcohol Long Island iced tea margarita I
know girls it'll straight up get a beer
just like you dance with I mean you
can't dance with a martini what are you
gonna do with a martini
appletinis I didn't know what she's got
a little I got whiskey I like that all
right you guys gotta get girls don't
really need to plan for a girls night
out because anywhere they walk in
everything's immediately given to them
women watching this raise your hand if
you've ever spent $90 at a bar oh you
haven't cuz I have never been taking the
savings oh no I'm cool yeah I'll pay $12
for your drink Instagram but then there
is that friend though it's like yo girls
tabs on me tonight
I always thought she's gonna fall
imagine if when guys went to sports
games they were just handed beer
after girls nights over then it's food
right it's like grease again I don't
care if it's healthy I'm just gonna go
to this 24-hour diner the thing that
would a girl's night everybody that
started the night together ends the
night together read it's like it's like
the no man left behind right right don't
bail on another girl objective of a guys
night out is to get laid
and a girls night out is to have a grand
old time and yeah every single time it
fills a void emotionally in cathartic
lead which is really admirable I know
right yeah you could take a cue from
them it's your night you deserve it
it's girls night this girl's cousin</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
