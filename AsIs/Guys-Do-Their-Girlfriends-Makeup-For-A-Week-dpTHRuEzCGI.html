little you have like a beauty mark it's
right there
[Laughter]
so chip should chip in a little chip
chip chip chip chip this week I would be
doing her makeup all week a day great I
kind of know what I want to do and how I
want to go about doing it I'm gonna make
sure not to put like a pancake on her
face all I know is that it takes a
long-ass time I mean usually I give her
like about an hour for what she calls
full face if we go somewhere what
happened down for half face these are
the terms I know all I know is that it
takes like 20 25 minutes to put makeup
and then when you're done it I don't
really notice that much of a difference
this starts now how gothic do you want
to look this week okay so we're gonna
take the flip-flop amendment put that up
there that's not right got stuff on the
back of it so maybe it's not helpful
it's not help NARS NARS make it an arse
tea mix for all your Nicks all your
pores pores that we fix the things is
this supposed to like make your eyebrows
look solid this is why you're a Sephora
Rouge member nattai poreless a little
bit too much see MA oh this looks good
already
what the where is this what have
you done what the is feeln
dancer oh man that's been close your
eyes
we should never have caught me here yeah
yeah right
speechless before you look in the mirror
just know I'm really sorry what the
is this uh what is this guy even come
with eyeliner on is the question
oh no but you like it so I'll just try
to do something nice for you not the
worst thing I've ever seen I don't think
you're not difficult to put together
this is more of an abstract thing maybe
not Bob Rossville I'm more like Picasso
imagine if Kylie Jenner did that
everybody would you the next day my main
hope is that he gets better at makeup
artistry so that I don't look like this
all week I would say my main hope is to
get out of this without her hating me
for the rest of our lives okay I am
going to work like this yeah heading
into work oh I am
not ready for today I look like a drunk
vampire I don't think it's all it what
that could be kind of cool BAM pyres is
in right now
would you have noticed it if I hadn't
told you I did it looks tell uh please
big lines reactions have been like
surprised that John was the one who did
my makeup I did have one girl do a
literal double take which was funny
enough to not hurt my feelings that much
and I guess it can only get better from
here
you ready alright okay okay our
challenge today isn't like holding her
I'm gonna say this is not perfect but we
as people are not perfect
oh boy hmm looking a little Kylie Jenner
him into it usually when I put on makeup
I'm like super confident in myself but
honestly John did a really good job this
morning it's like kind of a weirdly
perfect like makeup a no makeup look I
don't think anyone is gonna think
anything different of me I feel like
he's one of those kids who didn't color
in the lines or something and like it
just never changed does look pretty cool
love you look like a joker to me
exciting updates on the end of my day
somebody told me that they thought I had
beautiful skin today and I don't think
I've ever gotten that compliment doing
my own makeup so I'm very impressed with
John and his ability to make me look
Lala's the mess that is my lips I was
lumbers Rocco Ally I don't usually look
like this you guys the challenge of the
day is smoky eye so we bout to get smoky
up in this bitch to be perfectly honest
I only barely know what is
all right do your best nice upward
motion you see the crease that's smokey
a smokey to bear every day this
gets night for yes I'm looking at your
face I know it's not good ooh almost
nailed it almost nailed it
nobody cares will you say anything to me
I mean after they won four strangers but
like I have been getting rid looks I'm
definitely not as embarrassed as
yesterday though yesterday I really just
wanted
wipe my face down none to be is nothing
to be embarrassed about but today is
okay more than okay smoking I know we
always say laughs like how were hers
critics whatever but like I'm seeing
that in full action it's time for the
main event when I'm done she gonna be
looking like Catwoman whoo oh yeah whoo
oh you're doing something right hand
yeah Angie left him it's an interesting
start when you see somebody with the cat
eye does it usually go down I don't
really know no voila
damn look how caddy that is so much for
getting the wrong ambushed by a bevy I
would like to call this challenge a
success until the line good she feels so
self-conscious and so nervous playing
don't go
I think he's learning like you can see
like the progression of growth most the
feedback was positive so 10 is
definitely improving and you can see
right now how dope this highlighter is
could be a great job the final day the
final challenge I'm a playa sure that I
applied myself when I was in school this
is the day we were go to the hospital it
was very strong smelling I feel like I'm
getting high off it is blue right now
this looked a lot easier tutorial me
wake up with one less functioning eye
tomorrow yeah we shouldn't have started
with this I didn't do your face no you
didn't
oh you did it oh my god you did it it's
not terrible mm-hmm
there's some lifts here it looks like
you're coming home from like a rough
night but maybe you did your makeup
yourself just like don't let them do it
again John did like a great job better
than I think I could have even done I'm
like much more cool I think that's way
better than what I would be able to do
from afar I feel like it was possible I
like yeah
how job done dead pathani and a little
excited to take them off because they're
itchy but I feel like pretty glamorous I
definitely have a newfound appreciation
for the effort that you ladies put into
applying your makeup I'm super
embarrassed about how stressed out I was
and a lot of people opposed to me they
would never have pegged myself as the
kind of person who is like super into
how I look but I was very stressed out
what I do this again for fun not
probably not but if she need me I got a
covered but we did it it was kind of fun
and I'm probably doing it you would baby</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
