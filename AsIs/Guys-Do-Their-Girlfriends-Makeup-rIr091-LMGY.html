I think I'll do that I don't even know
where to begin
do they even smell different what you
think it's just gonna spread evenly over
the skin not so much that values do that
oh oops
blush is not supposed to feel wet oh
this is like a foundation for the nose
it's obviously what a concealer it is go
down the middle let's just put it there
whatever it's nicer if you keep laughing
I'm sorry so you get the whole top of
the eyelid and I don't think you do the
bottom of the island all right oh that
looks good
I know about cats not okay I know I know
what cats look like do you put eyeliner
up here on the brown why up there show
me some different lip options do this
know start with a bottom lip it's the
biggest one this looks like paint but
we're committing to it not as easy as I
thought to get off and that is how you
make someone up I feel beautiful but I
haven't looked into marryin you don't
like a clown and that's a win
I honestly thought that he was going to
do a good job he was a theater major I
now know why it takes so long there's
some interesting streaks and things
going on I thought I was gonna like kill
this it's a lot harder than it that I
thought would be
the very least you do the
high-definition powder on the ears</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
