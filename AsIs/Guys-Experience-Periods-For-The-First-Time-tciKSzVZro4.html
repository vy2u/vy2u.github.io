before I don't know maybe it'll make me
a better man
people who've experienced them they
always seem like super stressed about it
and just like it's the end of the world
I want to understand more why or how
it's so stressful I won't be the first
man to ever have a period because
they're definitely trans men who do have
periods I can't wear a pad with my
boxers what this doesn't feel very
comfortable I feel like this is gonna
feel real weird I'm I I'm really excited
here I'm not lying I'm going to be Aunt
Flo for this experiment and I'm making
the menstrual rig and doling out the
pads
bleeding first blood ready him I do here
always synced up Edgar just told me that
I needed to meet him in the bathroom
there's been a really stressful day
emotionally this is what I get for
making almost period jokes as a kid what
kind of creatures to do me you know
she's on her period and something girls
mad or something I would pull down my
pants to change my pad and all hell
broke loose and the forest covering the
blood right now and I don't really know
what to do
and I really hope somebody isn't walking
right now I went into this like feminism
yeah and now I'm kind of like the
reality of like bleeding all day long as
like stinkiness
had is super uncomfortable and Branson
is just he on complaining and not
knowing the blood could start gushing
out of me at variable rates at any
moment is a terrifying sake has had
another accident
a mob of people came and started
laughing at me I had to realize that
there was someone who had that real
experience it wasn't like you know
thanks Raymond this was originally
supposed to be just men try periods for
a day and halfway through day one
Zak was like we should do this all week
I think by day three I'll be very
annoyed that I suggested that we do this
for three days you had a big flow and I
just feel gross and now I have to go
through the rest of the day like this
just want to be home curled up watching
cartoons I know work and I'm busy and
I'm trying to do things and I keep
having to like say sorry guys give me a
second I have to go check my pad my goal
for the days will have the same pair of
pants by the end of the day on my way
out of work today
a co-worker stopped me and said your
pants are red I was like so that's a
three pairs of pants I've lost now it's
my pad I had to go home change my pants
because my thighs were so covered in
blood hmm do you have that of course he
was the underwear that I just slept with
all night it's the last day of my period
and I'm so ready for this to be over
well I was on Starbucks just now I bled
to my pad and I didn't have a
replacement ran into the bathroom and
tried to clean myself up as best as I
could with paper towels I had the
realization like wow like women probably
actually do bleed through the tampon or
pack in public and don't always have
backups you should be able to find
tampons anywhere you go yeah I don't
think that tampon or pad be a privilege
I think they should definitely be like
all right
day three was the easiest day because I
completed my goal this is a rigged
reveal I was waiting for no red on my
pants Jesus cry
this has been a major inconvenience to
me over the past couple days and I'm
only experiencing like one of a lot of
symptoms of periods like I'm not dealing
with hormone stuff I'm not dealing with
cramps I'm not dealing with bloating or
anything one thing that I have noticed
about this is a strong community of
woman that is brought into my life I've
had pads offered to me I've had people
be like hey check your pet you got a
little blood is once I lose this period
maybe I won't be a part of the
sisterhood anymore I would say that
every man should do this because it's
hard for you to see something unless
you're in it and I feel like I saw a lot
excuse me people I have something to
announce my period is over</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
