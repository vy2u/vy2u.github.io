of just like I have no idea
it must be something with these straps
gravity it's probably padding this
doesn't my guess yeah like it works well
your steps you just put on mica just
like a house you get start with the
foundation after the foundation there's
a powder process step one foundation
step two make up
I guess you work your way up here and
then go outward I didn't know there were
steps I feel like I got this down pretty
good
okay so it's something like you know
like The Karate Kid
like that you drape it you curl it and
you flip it I heard of pasties as a
child when watching the VMAs and seeing
little Kim pasties are like pastries
they're like a dessert for a smooth look
with her that your bra oh I get what
they do
dad's for the nipple goes
again magic by showing great strength
and character you just put these on and
start walking like loudly there's a
trick to it feeling this is not gonna
fit me look see all right yeah it's not
it's not easy
I feel very tall it's tap dancing mother
it's not as strikingly uncomfortable as
I thought I feel like a few hours of
this though I'm an ignorant man when it
comes to that
it's like shackles on my feet I feel
like I'm walking on fire thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
