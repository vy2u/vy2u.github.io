I'm pretty good at flirting if you're a
cute girl we are just so thankful cute
girl spending time with us everybody
flirts differently which is why it's
hard to know when people are flirting
like I need that moment where her friend
says like oh she likes you
I contacted like the primal flirt that's
like the like he you look down the
barrel and someone's like I feel you
it's such a powerful intimate thing to
make prolonged eye contact with someone
make that eye contact with you like look
at that chandelier mmm what's going on
over here they look like they're having
fun
oh hi you I try to like get a little
hand contact of some kind you know
because then it's like you're
introducing yourself as sexual partner
it's hard as a guy you don't want to
come off as too pushy or touchy or
feeling I feel like you're not allowed
to touch somebody you like pretty much
ever because you don't know them yeah
it's such a weird difference between not
you talk felt like someone you might be
interested in versus how you talk to
like your buddies now kind of lower your
voice a little bit so she's you know
she's like this ship so she could pay
attention when you talk to a girl you
got a : log truck or voice you sound
tough and most of you like her you know
but with girls you got to be like this
if you just text from the heart you
should be able to text straight to her
heart not dick pics are not going there
and leave your dick out of this guy's
you don't want to make it so unthought
out that you just say something like you
up or sup girl
the three little cloud dots come up and
then they go away for a couple seconds
and you're like oh my god what happened
and then they come back you know I got
my favorite flirty emoji you can give
like a nice you know yeah but this is
also a little bit suggestive sometimes
the heart eyes guy is pretty nice guitar
saxophone guy surfing to me this is just
like he's a fun guy I'll do like a
winking frowny face Hey Girl what you
doing tonight it will get a response of
like what does this mean if someone can
explain to me how you flirt on tinder I
would love to know I'm picky choosy when
I'm like sober but when it's like
Saturday night I have had a couple shots
I'm just just everyone manche manche
manche manche there's like some element
of speed because you're like flipping
through people like they're like playing
cards and then you're like this one and
then it matches and you're like ah and
you like vote something quick flirtation
and attraction is more of an
accumulation of experiences and like a
video game where you beat the level then
get the next level you just have to get
out there and like fail a couple times
flirting is a fun thing you get to do
and if you keep doing it with somebody
then they might actually make out with
you and that's the best</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
