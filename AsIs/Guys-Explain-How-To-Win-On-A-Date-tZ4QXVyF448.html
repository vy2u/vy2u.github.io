for very honest guys who are going to
give us a little bit of an insight into
what they're thinking when they go on
dates before meeting with them I'm
gathering questions from some of my
friends how's that sound to you it
sounds fantastic
yeah what are some of your winning moves
what do you think is really gonna get me
let me tell you the two things that
girls swoon for huh rescue dogs and
nonprofits you can compliment a girl
about something that she literally just
said I mean too aggressive to some like
certain guys put the hands on your head
yes I did hey but we still at the back
like you know you have to relax if
there's that initial spark just play it
out I can't act it's simple if you can
give a girl a hard time I think if you
can listen and then I think honestly if
you guys question that is the number one
thing just listen yeah ask questions
guys stop being nervous AXA ladies
questions what do you guys look for in a
date core values as long as there's some
overlap in that Venn diagram the first
thing I'm looking for in a date with a
girl is confidence show me that you're
passionate about something definitely a
girl that has a sense of humor can mess
with you a little bit consumer I think
that like the biggest thing if we can't
laugh because now we have nothing to
relate to there's no good time all our
good times like hey when you help me put
my bed together it's like two guys even
think about how much they're gonna drink
before they go on the date or they just
make that
decision as they're going okay I feel
like it's like at a comedy club there's
like a two-drink minimum yeah if you're
going to dinner who drinks right top it
there you drink as much as you want just
don't get sloppy and my goal isn't to
get you too drunk because I want the
sober you yeah I make this decision and
then if you go somewhere else then
whatever happens after that happens
after that if the first date ends and
then she's like what do you want to do
after this then you're like oh okay
right right they have some drinks me I
just go in like hey we pretty much on a
two-drink budget right well the other
thing I'd like to know honest guys is if
guys don't really like text a lot after
a date is that like a calculated move
are they're not into me like what's
what's up with that but god I may feel
like he's coming off too strong if he's
like so we can do this next week he's
probably just wanna play cool he doesn't
want to seem too thirsty one of my
favorite jokes I've ever heard is one of
my friends who's a female comedian once
said she's like if he really wants to
turn me on he'll send a picture of
himself ignoring my text message damn I
think if the guy doesn't initiate at
least in the very beginning I say walk
because to me that is laziness is there
anything else you'd like us to keep in
mind or anything else that we should
know about you I would like to really
know there intend you just be clear with
me so I don't be going like oh my god I
think she really liked me and she I
don't know I thought we was just friends
like I you've been doing this for like a
year oh my god ladies when the bill
comes at least pump-fake act like you're
gonna go throw up and do stuff like at
least act like men function a lot like
nuclear batteries that the sense that
there is a decay in their animal-like
behavior all teenage and early twenty
men good possibility worse comebacks 23
to say like 28 are very volatile years
and so we're thinking the whole time
what can I do to separate myself guys
you don't have to do anything
you're giving yourself none of the best
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
