gynecologist is somebody that takes care
of the flu ganda a doctor that
specializes in the nether region of a
woman's body he makes sure that
everything is in order
everything is smelling right moisture is
on good levels you need regular
check-ups you got to take it in it's
like an oil change it's like when I go
get my oil change do I know why I need
to know not really but I just like yo
just do it all right vagina questions
how was your vagina feeling lately
having zero vagina been hurting how is
the cleaning process been what's been
coming out of your coochie crack do you
still have periods how active are you
sexually okay how many uh are you
relaxed um do you mind if I do this
think I think it's just the general
stuff before they before they get their
hands what so to speak but my friends
told me they prop your feet up on these
thing and then they kind of like open
you know they're like open wide well so
how are things like and then he like
puts them and then you guys like I like
to imagine that they give the woman a
lollipop surely they're probably shoving
fingers up your you know what you're you
know making sure all the the walls are
intact the lips are doing what they need
to do now just make sure everything is
flowing it's got a flow I have no idea
how to tell if the cervix is okay but I
imagine it's like an avocado checking to
see if that's right I can't imagine Oh
pap smear is certainly a word I've heard
and it sounds like the thing you never
want to put on your bagel putting on a
fresh coat of paint and the doctor rubs
jelly on his hand and just like gets it
all jellified they apply it leave it in
there for maybe they just leave it in
there and it dissolves there's like up
like a speculum is that weak you okay so
there's a speculum and it's like the
jaws of light I know it gets very cold
and drafty I think what you do is you
get like an extra-long q-tip and you
kind of squirrel it around there like
that and then make sure they have a lot
of that juice on there smear it around
and you will pass and say it's gonna be
alright and then they find out if you
have any like diseases or like if you're
pregnant or if you if your uterus is
gonna fall out of your body
yeah why don't we have like penis
doctors it definitely makes me feel more
appreciative that the penis is something
that is not as hard to maintain your
gynecologist knows you better than your
family does in a lot of ways I feel like
after that it's like why don't you guys
come on for dinner</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
