g-dragon I am going to try to look like
Prince but I just want to look like the
dudes from My Chemical Romance
specifically drawed way I don't know
what foundation is I just feel like
that's where I should start
it's called foundation how do you do
this is so hard
I think you wonder if I needed how much
I've dreamt about this and get it wrong
you don't you're being you're becoming
beautiful Frankie that's not right oh no
you missed on that should you do I don't
know
everything was looking okay until I did
this what are you talking about you're
you look amazing she look really great
having some self-image issues over here
not feeling great about this I think I
came pretty close like I feel like I
could buy at least hang out with the
band maybe not be in the band I'm not
terribly disappointed in myself
hi I'm Josh I'm a professional makeup
artist so I see that we tried some
different looks their looks for sure and
I'm here to give the guys looks based on
their favorite male makeup icon for
shame we are doing a look based off of
g-dragon who is a kpop idol and for him
we are going to focus on flawless glowy
skin and kind of a more warm taupe
bronzy eye
for that we are doing a look based off
the legend known as crimps prince does
have a typical winged eyeliner so we're
going to do that in more of a natural
shade
he was very neutral shadows on the lid
and he has a very contoured face
for Edgar we are basing his look off of
my Chemical Romance so we're going to be
doing very punk rock glam very smoky
eyes and just really pristine skin
since our g-dragon inspired look oh hey
all right this is your prince inspired
look all right Dan
whoa I'm into this good god this is so
different for what I did so and this is
your My Chemical Romance inspired look
oh yes I got really into kpop in college
and one of the first things that
attracted me to the genre was the look
of the guys and how much freedom men in
kpop have to like play with makeup and
play with fashion and the way they dance
I would like go on a date with this look
or like to a ball if I like didn't feel
social pressure to not play with makeup
I could see myself getting pretty into
this the first night me and my
girlfriend met we listened to Purple
Rain and made up so that's not a reason
for me Brits well I think I want to go
to a dance club in all leather with this
look
sounds like West Hollywood I think I
feel kind of edgy I don't feel like
feminine I want to look like Broadway
from My Chemical Romance because I've
always wanted to be a part of the whole
emo scene because I felt like I could
always go to those concerts but I never
had to look to go to those concerts
they'd be like why are you here yeah now
they can't question it makes me feel sad
inside which is exactly what I was going
for it's okay to feel sad sometimes I'm
not okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=7dc1d461-332d-458e-b8ed-873b47142d09"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
